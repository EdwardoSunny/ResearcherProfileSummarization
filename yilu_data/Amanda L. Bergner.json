        "Title": "Individuals' experiences in genetic counseling and predictive testing for familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",
        "Abstract": "As clinical genetic testing in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diagnostic setting increases, the identification of at-risk family members has also expanded. No practice guidelines specifically for predictive genetic testing exist, and few studies about the psychological impacts of testing in this subgroup have occurred, limiting the ability to tailor recommendations and counseling in this community. We surveyed asymptomatic individuals at risk for inheriting an ALS-associated gene mutation. The 80-question survey was designed using a combination of validated measures (General Anxiety Disorder; FACToR; Decision Regret Scale) and original items. Ninety participants completed the survey, including those who completed predictive genetic testing (N\u2009=\u200942) and those who did not (N\u2009=\u200948). Gene positive individuals experienced greater negativity, uncertainty, and overall psychological impairment (p\u2009=\u20090.002; p\u2009<\u20090.001; p\u2009=\u20090.001). Individuals who had not undergone testing reported thinking about their risk multiple times per day and experiencing more decisional regret than those who tested (p\u2009=\u20090.006). In terms of decision-making, being prepared for potential clinical drug trials was a more important potential benefit among those who underwent testing (p\u2009=\u20090.026). Participants valuing preparedness for clinical drug trials supports the concept that genetic testing for ALS will increase as research in gene-targeted therapeutics progresses. This study describes factors relevant to the genetic testing decision-making process and adaptation to results from the perspective of at-risk individuals, which can ultimately guide genetic counseling practice in this population.",

        "Abstract": "The increased utilization of clinical genomic sequencing in the past decade has ushered in the era of genomic medicine, requiring genetics providers to acquire new skills and adapt their practices. The change in workplace responsibilities of clinical/medical geneticists (CMGs) and genetic counselors (GCs) in North America, due to the evolution of genetic testing, has not been studied. We surveyed CMGs (n\u2009=\u200980) and GCs (n\u2009=\u2009127) with experience in general/pediatric genetics to describe their current practice of clinical tasks and the change in regularity of performing these tasks over the past 5-10\u2009years. Currently, complementarity of responsibilities between CMGs and GCs clearly exists but providers who have been in the field for longer have noted role changes. Trends indicate that fewer experienced CMGs perform physical exams and select genetic tests than before and fewer experienced GCs complete requisitions and write result letters. The frequency of CMGs and GCs who investigate genetic test results, however, has increased. This study provides insight into the changing landscape of clinical genetics practice. Our findings suggest that the roles and responsibilities of CMGs and GCs have shifted in the past decade.",

        "Abstract": "Telegenetics played an important role in providing genetic services to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, at our institution, it enabled us to expand our genetic counseling and testing services to non-local family members of patients outside of our prior catchment area. However, as telegenetics continues to be utilized even as social distancing is no longer required, further information is needed regarding the impact of this modality on patient experience within cardiogenetics. This study qualitatively explored the experiences of 12 genotype positive individuals who underwent genetic counseling and testing via telegenetics during the first 22\u00a0months of the COVID-19 pandemic and compared the experiences of local vs. non-local patients. Both local and non-local participants discussed similar benefits and drawbacks to the use of technology in telegenetics and overall found the use of telegenetics and at-home genetic testing to be convenient. Both groups also noted having to make changes in their daily lives and future planning as a consequence of the positive genetic testing results. However, access to follow-up care differed between local and non-local participants, with more local participants having scheduled and attended appointments with the appropriate medical providers compared to non-local participants. Supplying non-local patients access to remote cardiogenetic testing may therefore require careful consideration in how to ensure proper follow-up care for genotype positive patients and may necessitate the involvement of national professional or patient-centered organizations to help streamline the referral process.",

        "Abstract": "Professional interpreters are an integral component of healthcare for Spanish-speaking individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP). Research has demonstrated that errors in interpretation are common and can contribute to poor outcomes for Spanish-speaking clients. Providers with some Spanish proficiency may be able to detect clinically significant interpretation errors, potentially limiting negative clinical outcomes and helping to reduce health disparities for clients with LEP. This study aimed to identify the level of Spanish proficiency necessary for genetic counselors to be able to detect a majority of clinically significant errors made by a professional interpreter during a reproductive genetic counseling session. Practicing genetic counselors and genetic counseling graduate students were surveyed regarding their Spanish language background, experience working with interpreters, and self-rated Spanish proficiency. Participants then watched short video clips from three simulated reproductive genetic counseling sessions conducted with a professional interpreter and were tasked with identifying clinically significant interpretation errors. Survey responses were analyzed from 118 participants who met eligibility criteria. Participants who reported \"basic\" and \"fair\" Spanish proficiency detected an average of 36.5% and 67% of clinically significant errors, respectively. Those reporting \"good\" proficiency or higher detected more than 80% of errors. Overall self-rated Spanish proficiency was positively correlated with years of Spanish language education and individual measures of speaking, listening, and reading proficiency, indicating that self-report may be a reasonable measure of proficiency when the goal is error detection in an interpreted session. Genetic counselors with even minimal Spanish proficiency can detect clinically significant interpretation errors, allowing for the correction of these errors during the session. Genetic counselors with \"basic\" and \"fair\" may consider genetic counseling-specific Spanish language classes to increase their proficiency to be able to detect a majority of interpretation errors and thereby improve the quality of care and reduce health disparities for Spanish-speaking clients.",

        "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the globe in the past year, demanding shifts in all aspects of life including health profession education. The New York City area was the first major United States epicenter and is home to four genetic counseling graduate programs. We set out to explore the multifaceted programmatic changes required from the four institutions in an early pandemic epicenter, providing the longest time horizon available for assessing the implications of this restructuring on graduate education in the profession. Using practitioner-based enquiry, our iterative reflections identified three phases of COVID-19 response within our programs from March through December 2020. The spring months were marked by significant upheaval and reactivity, with a focus on stabilizing our programs in an unstable environment that included a significant medical response required in our area. By summer, we were reinvesting time and energy into our programs and prioritizing best practices in online learning. Relative predictability returned in the fall with noticeable improvements in flexibility and proactive problem-solving within our new environment. We have begun to identify changes in both curricula and operations that are likely to become more permanent. Telehealth fieldwork, remote supervision, simulated cases with standardized clients, and virtual recruitment and admission events are some key examples. We explored early outcome measures, such as enrollment, retention, course evaluations, and student academic and fieldwork progress, all indicating little change from prior to the pandemic to date. Overall, we found our programs, and genetic counseling graduate education more broadly, to be much more resilient and flexible than we would ever have realized. The COVID-19 pandemic has awakened in us a desire to move ahead with reduced barriers to educational innovation.",

This personal work is ongoing, though it was through our individual paths that led us to engage in dialogue on race and racism at the 38th National Society of Genetic Counselors Annual Conference. We initially did not know each other; however, we were drawn by a mutual desire to further the conversation and sought connection with each other after the Conversations Around Diversity Platform Presentations. Through sustained, open dialogue we created a brave space for sharing our emotional and intellectual responses to the conference. Through this dialogue and through written reflections, we recognized an emboldened urgency to author a joint reflection on our shared responsibility as genetic counseling training program leaders to use our privilege in service to our students and future students. We have the evidence that we are not a diverse profession. We have more evidence now than we did before that our profession performs poorly with regards to inclusivity. Our inability to acknowledge, address, and discuss racism and other forms of oppression is damaging to each of us individually and as a group of professionals. We owe it to ourselves, our students, our patients, and colleagues to name our learned biases and behaviors, own them and interrupt them.",

        "Abstract": "Genetic counselors working in a clinical setting may find themselves recruiting, enrolling, and returning results for genomic research, and existing clinical relationships with study participants may impact these research interactions. We present a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews of participants enrolled in a genome sequencing/exome sequencing (GS/ES) study at the same institution where they receive clinical care. Interviews were coded for motivations to participate and expectations of this research. The interviews revealed common motivations for participation, including altruism and hope for benefit for themselves, family members, and/or others with their condition. Additionally, themes emerged related to unintentional influence based on trust of the clinical provider that recruited them to the study. Participant trust in the enrolling provider at times appeared to extend to the study team to decide which research results to return and to do so in an appropriate format. Participants also based expectations for research results return on previous clinical genetic testing experiences, which may or may not be realistic depending on study design. It is imperative that genetic counselors enrolling patients into research studies be aware of the potential influence of their clinical relationship on potential subjects, be transparent about their role on the study team, and help set expectations about the study process, including results return.",

        "Abstract": "Although consensus is building that primary (PR) and secondary findings (SF) from genomic research should be offered to participants under some circumstances, data describing (1) actual choices of study participants and (2) factors associated with these choices are limited, hampering study planning. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of choices made for return of PR and SF during informed consent by members of the first 247 families (790 individuals) enrolled in the Baylor-Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics, a genome sequencing study. Most (619; 78.3%) chose to receive SF and PR, 66 (8.4%) chose PR only, 65 (8.2%) wanted no results, and 40 (5.1%) chose SF only. Choosing SF was associated with an established clinical diagnosis in the proband (87.8 vs 79%, P=0.009) and European ancestry (EA) (87.7 vs 73%, P<0.008). Participants of non-European ancestry (NEA) were as likely as those of EA to choose SF when consented by a genetic counselor (GC) (82% NEA vs 88.3% EA, P=0.09) but significantly less likely when consented by a physician (67.4% NEA vs 85.4% EA, P=0.001). Controlling for proband diagnosis, individuals of NEA were 2.13-fold (95% CI: 1.11-4.08) more likely to choose SF when consented by a GC rather than a physician. Participants of NEA were 3-fold more likely than those of EA to decline all study results (14.7% NEA vs 5.4% EA, P<0.008). In this ethnically diverse population, whereas most participants desired PR and SF, more than 20% declined some or all results, highlighting the importance of research participant choice.",

        "Abstract": "Supervision is a practice that is utilized by a variety of practitioners to hone their counseling skills. Genetic counselors have embraced the supervision process, and some seek out supervision in a group setting with peers. Researchers have described the structure and content of genetic counseling peer supervision groups, and provided evidence for the benefits of seeking peer supervision. This study aimed to describe the interpersonal aspects of one genetic counseling peer supervision group, including personality traits and group dynamics, and how those factors influenced our experiences within the group. We also describe how the process of evaluating these factors impacted us individually and collectively. There was consensus that the group was a safe and trusting one, which was united by similar goals and mutual respect. Members reported gaining insights about how their own personality functioned within the group milieu, and also how the group setting impacted them. Based on our experiences, we recommend that other peer supervision groups consider similar self-evaluations on a periodic basis, both to enhance group functioning and to allow for increased self-awareness and professional growth.",

        "Abstract": "The first practice based competencies (PBCs) for the field of genetic counseling were adopted by the American Board of Genetic Counseling (ABGC), 1996. Since that time, there has been significant growth in established and new work settings (clinical and non-clinical) and changes in service delivery models and the roles of genetic counselors. These changes prompted the ABGC to appoint a PBC Task Force in 2011 to review the PBCs with respect to their current relevance and to revise and update them as necessary. There are four domains in the revised PBCs: (I) Genetics Expertise and Analysis (II) Interpersonal, Psychosocial and Counseling Skills (III) Education and (IV) Professional Development and Practice. There are 22 competencies, each clarified with learning objectives or samples of activities and skills; a glossary is included. New competencies were added that address genomics, genetic testing and genetic counselors' roles in risk assessment, education, supervision, conducting research and presenting research options to patients. With PBCs serving as the pre-defined abilities or outcomes of training, graduating genetic counselors will be well prepared to enter the field with a minimum level of skills and abilities. A description of the Task Force's work, key changes and the 2013 PBCs are presented herein.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the high prevalence and significant morbidity of spinal anomalies in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the pathogenesis of these defects remains largely unknown. Here, we present two murine models: Nf1flox/-;PeriCre and Nf1flox/-;Col.2.3Cre mice, which recapitulate spinal deformities seen in the human disease. Dynamic histomorphometry and microtomographic studies show recalcitrant bone remodeling and distorted bone microarchitecture within the vertebral spine of Nf1flox/-;PeriCre and Nf1flox/-;Col2.3Cre mice, with analogous histological features present in a human patient with dystrophic scoliosis. Intriguingly, 36-60% of Nf1flox/-;PeriCre and Nf1flox/-;Col2.3Cre mice exhibit segmental vertebral fusion anomalies with boney obliteration of the intervertebral disc (IVD). While analogous findings have not yet been reported in the NF1 patient population, we herein present two case reports of IVD defects and interarticular vertebral fusion in patients with NF1. Collectively, these data provide novel insights regarding the pathophysiology of dystrophic spinal anomalies in NF1, and provide impetus for future radiographic analyses of larger patient cohorts to determine whether IVD and vertebral fusion defects may have been previously overlooked or underreported in the NF1 patient population.",

        "Abstract": "Genomic sequencing technology is increasingly used in genetic research. Studies of informed consent for exome and genome sequencing (ES/GS) research have largely involved hypothetical scenarios or healthy individuals enrolling in population-based studies. Studies have yet to explore the consent experiences of adults with inherited disease. We conducted a qualitative interview study of 15 adults recently enrolled in a large-scale ES/GS study (11 affected adults, four parents of affected children). Our study had two goals: (1) to explore three theoretical barriers to consent for ES/GS research (interpretive/technical complexity, possibility of incidental findings, and risks of loss of privacy); and (2) to explore how interviewees experienced the consent process. Interviewees could articulate study goals and processes, describe incidental findings, discuss risks of privacy loss, and reflect on their consent experience. Few expected the study would identify the genetic cause of their condition. All elected to receive incidental findings. Interviewees acknowledged paying little attention to potential implications of incidental findings in light of more pressing goals of supporting research regarding their own medical conditions. Interviewees suggested that experience living with a genetic condition prepared them to adjust to incidental findings. Interviewees also expressed little concern about loss of confidentiality of study data. Some experienced the consent process as very long. None desired reconsent prior to return of study results. Families with inherited disease likely would benefit from a consent process in which study risks and benefits were discussed in the context of prior experiences with genetic research and genetic disease.",

        "Title": "Intracranial hemorrhage as the initial manifestation of a congenital disorder of glycosylation.",
        "Abstract": "Intracranial hemorrhage in a term neonate is a rare event in the absence of an identifiable precipitating factor such as severe thrombocytopenia, mechanical trauma, asphyxia, infections, or congenital vascular malformations. Congenital disorders of glycosylation are a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of multisystem disorders characterized by the abnormal glycosylation of a number of glycoproteins. Although bleeding caused by abnormal glycosylation of various coagulation factors is a well-known clinical complication of several types of congenital disorders of glycosylation, intracranial hemorrhage has not been reported as an initial manifestation of this entity. Here we report the detailed history of a family with 2 consecutive male infants, both born at term with intracranial hemorrhage diagnosed within the first 24 hours of life. The diagnosis of a congenital disorder of glycosylation was established in the second infant by an abnormal glycosylation of serum transferrin detected by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry. Both infants showed significant neurologic deterioration during the first month of life, and both died at 5 months of age. Intracranial hemorrhage in a term neonate without a potential precipitating factor represents yet another clinical feature that should raise the suspicion for a congenital disorder of glycosylation.",
