        "Abstract": "At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK's Scientific Committee issued extreme social distancing measures, termed 'shielding', aimed at a subpopulation deemed extremely clinically vulnerable to infection. National guidance for risk stratification was based on patients' age, comorbidities and immunosuppressive therapies, including biologics that are not captured in primary care records. This process required considerable clinician time to manually review outpatient letters. Our aim was to develop and evaluate an automated shielding algorithm by text-mining outpatient letter diagnoses and medications, reducing the need for future manual review.",

Editorial guidance developed by two independent clinicians was used to annotate sixty anonymized clinic letters to create the gold standard. Concepts were categorized by semantic type, and labels were applied to indicate contextual attributes such as negation. The natural language processing (NLP) engine was Linguamatics I2E version 5.3.1, equipped with an algorithm for contextualizing words and phrases and an ontology of terms from Intelligent Medical Objects to which those tokens were mapped. Performance of the engine was assessed on a training set of the documents using precision, recall, and the F1 score, with subset analysis for semantic type, accurate negation, exact versus partial conceptual matching, and discontinuous text. The engine underwent tuning, and the final performance was determined for a test set. The test set showed an F1 score of 0.81 and 0.84 using strict and relaxed criteria respectively when appropriate negation was not required and 0.75 and 0.77 when it was. F1 scores were higher when concepts were derived from continuous text only. This pilot study showed that a commercially available NLP engine delivered good overall results for identifying a wide spectrum of structured clinical concepts. Such a system holds promise for extracting concepts from free text to populate problem lists or for data mining projects.",

Though organizational clinical data are abundant, these are largely inaccessible to outside researchers. Statistical, machine learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale data beyond what is available in any given organization. Here, we introduce the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science community focused on analyzing patient-level data from many centers.",

        "Abstract": "This study investigated the automated detection of antiretroviral toxicities in structured electronic health records data. The evaluation compared responses generated by 5 clinical pharmacists and 1 prototype knowledge-based application for 15 randomly selected test cases. The main outcomes were inter-subject dissimilarity of responses quantified by the Jaccard distance, and the mean proportion of correct responses by each subject. The statistical differences in inter-subject Jaccard distances suggested that the prototype was inferior to clinical pharmacists in the detection of possible antiretroviral toxicity associations from structured data. The reason for dissimilarities was attributable to inadequate domain coverage by the prototype. The differences in the mean proportion of correct responses between the clinical pharmacists and the prototype were statistically indistinguishable. Overall, this study suggests that knowledge-based applications have the potential to support automated detection of antiretroviral toxicities from structured patient records. Furthermore, the study demonstrates a systematic approach for validating such applications quantitatively.",

During the 2014-2016 West African Ebola epidemic, paper-based data collection systems at ETCs compromised the quality, quantity, and confidentiality of patient data. Electronic health record (EHR) systems have the potential to address such problems, with benefits for patient care, surveillance, and research. However, no suitable software was available for deployment when large-scale ETCs opened as the epidemic escalated in 2014.",

The MTM service model and chronic care model were selected as parent theories. Review article abstracts targeting medication therapy management in chronic disease care were retrieved from Ovid Medline (2000-2016). Unique concepts in each abstract were extracted using MetaMap and their pairwise cooccurrence determined. The information was used to construct a network graph of concept co-occurrence that was analyzed to identify content for the new conceptual model. 142 abstracts were analyzed. Medication adherence is the most studied drug therapy problem and co-occurred with concepts related to patient-centered interventions targeting self-management. The enhanced model consists of 65 concepts clustered into 14 constructs. The framework requires additional refinement and evaluation to determine its relevance and applicability across a broad audience including underserved settings.",

        "Abstract": "Drug allergy cross-reactivity checking is an important component of electronic health record systems. Currently, a single, open-source medication dictionary that can provide this function does not exist. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of using RxNorm and NDF-RT (National Drug File--Reference Terminology) for allergy management decision support. We evaluated the performance of using the Pharmacological Class, Mechanism of Action and Chemical Structure NDF-RT classifications in discriminating between safe and cross-reactive alternatives to a sample of common drug allergens. The positive predictive values for the three approaches were 96.3%, 99.3% and 96.2% respectively. The negative predictive values were 94.7%, 56.8% and 92.6%. Our findings suggest that in the absence of an established medication allergy classification system, using the Pharmacologic Class and Chemical Structure classifications in NDF-RT may still be effective for discriminating between safe and cross-reactive alternatives to potential allergens.",

We used the OpenMRS platform to rapidly develop an EMR system for the recently opened Kerry Town, Sierra Leone Ebola Treatment Centre. This system addresses the need for recording patient data and communicating it between the infectious and non-infectious zones, and is specifically designed for maximum usability by staff wearing cumbersome protective equipment. This platform is interoperable with other key eHealth systems in the country, and is extensible to other sites and diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Midwives in rural Ghana work at the frontline of the health care system, where they have access to essential data about the patient population. However, current methods of data capture, primarily pen and paper, make the data neither accessible nor usable for monitoring patient care or program evaluation. Electronic health (eHealth) systems present a potential mechanism for enhancing the roles of midwives by providing tools for collecting, exchanging, and viewing patient data as well as offering midwives the possibility for receiving information and decision support. Introducing such technology in low-resource settings has been challenging because of low levels of user acceptance, software design that does not match the end-user environment, and/or unforeseen challenges such as irregular power availability. These challenges are often attributable to a lack of understanding by the software developers of the end users' needs and work environment.",

The system, known as EzVac, has been operational since 1998 and now includes information on 2 million immunizations administered to more than 260,000 individuals. The system exchanges data with multiple electronic health records, a public health immunization registry, and a standalone personal health record. EzVac modules have recently been incorporated into the OpenMRS application and are being used to enhance immunization efforts in developing nations. We report on our experience with developing and using the EzVac system for 1) clinical care, both in local and global settings, 2) public health reporting, 3) consumer engagement, and 4) clinical and informatics research. We emphasize the advantages of using health IT standards to facilitate immunization information exchange in each of these domains.",

        "Abstract": "The field of mHealth has made significant advances in a short period of time, demanding a more thorough and scientific approach to understanding and evaluating its progress. A recent review of mHealth literature identified two primary research needs in order for mHealth to strengthen health systems and promote healthy behaviors, namely health outcomes and cost-benefits (Mechael et al., 2010 ). In direct response to the gaps identified in mHealth research, the aim of this paper is to present the study design and highlight key observations and next steps from an evaluation of the mHealth activities within the electronic health (eHealth) architecture implemented by the Millennium Villages Project (MVP) by leveraging data generated through mobile technology itself alongside complementary qualitative research and costing assessments. The study, funded by the International Development and Research Centre (IDRC) as part of the Open Architecture Standards and Information Systems research project (OASIS II) (Sinha, 2009 ), is being implemented on data generated by 14 MVP sites in 10 Sub-Saharan African countries including more in-depth research in Ghana, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. Specific components of the study include rigorous quantitative case-control analyses and other epidemiological approaches (such as survival analysis) supplemented by in-depth qualitative interviews spread out over 18 months, as well as a costing study to assess the impact of mHealth on health outcomes, service delivery, and efficiency.",

We describe a set of tools to meet the needs of different service areas including managing aggregate indicators, patient level record systems, and mobile tools for community outreach. We present the case of Sierra Leone and use this case to motivate and illustrate an architecture that allows us to provide services at each level of the health system (national, regional, facility and community) and provide different configurations of the tools as appropriate for the individual area. Finally, we present a, collaborative implementation of this approach in Sierra Leone.",

        "Abstract": "This paper describes the process of implementing a low-cost 'real-time' vital registration and verbal autopsy system integrated within an electronic medical record within the Millennium Village cluster in rural Ghana. Using MGV-Net, an open source health information architecture built around the OpenMRS platform, a total of 2378 births were registered between January 2007 and June 2009. The percentage of births registered in the health facility under supervision of a skilled attendant increased substantially over the course of the project from median of 35% in 2007 to 64% in 2008 and 85% midway through 2009. Building additional clinics to reduce distance to facility and using the CHEWs to refer women for delivery in the clinics are possible explanations for the success in the vital registration. The integration of vital registration and verbal autopsies with the MGV-Net information system makes it possible for rapid assessment of effectiveness and provides important feedback to local providers and the Millennium Villages Project.",

        "Abstract": "The Millennium Villages Project (MVP), based at The Earth Institute at Columbia University, is a bottom-up, community led approach to show how villages in developing countries can get out of the poverty trap that afflicts more than a billion people worldwide. With well-targeted, practical inputs can help the community invest in a path leading to self-sustaining development. There are 80 Millennium Villages clustered in 10 countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa. MVP is an important development process for empowering communities to invest in a package of integrated interventions aiming to increase food production, improve access to safe water, health care, education and infrastructure. The process benefits from synergies of the integrated approach and relies on community leadership as empowered by proven technological inputs. MVP is committed to a science-based approach to assess and monitor the progress of the communities towards clear objectives; the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to do so with mechanisms that are scalable and sustainable. This approach offers much more than simply collecting and analyzing data since the mechanism used for recording progress would provide a bridge over the divide which separates the haves and the have-nots (by facilitating the sharing of solutions from one community to another bidirectionally). By so doing, it allows people to enhance their own futures in a sustainable manner. Solutions found in one community are transferable to similar communities in other MVP villages. To achieve this goal, the MVP requires an information and communication system which can provide both necessary infrastructure for monitoring and evaluation, and tools for communicating among the villages, cities and countries. This system is called the Millennium Global Village-Net (MGV-Net). It takes advantage of the latest in open source software (OpenMRS), databases (MySQL), interface terminology, a centralized concept dictionary, and uses appropriate technology locally for data entry.",

        "Abstract": "In the United States and Europe, electronic health records (EHRs) allow information technology and decision-support to facilitate the activities of clinicians and are considered an important component of health care improvement. However, actual adoption of EHRs by physicians has been slow and the use of decision support has been minimal. Part of the difficulty lies in the challenges that users face in capturing structured clinical information. Reference and administrative terminologies have been in use for many years and provide a critical infrastructure to support reimbursement, decision-support and data analysis. The problem is that physicians do not think and work using reference terminologies. Interface terminologies bridge the gap between information that is in the physician's mind and information that can be interpreted by computer applications. The maps from interface terminologies to appropriate reference terminologies enable advanced functionality in clinical information systems. The conflict between the need for timely adoption of health information technology and the need for standardization is also relevant to the problems faced by health information technology in Africa. The problem of clinicians having to communicate and/or record information in a format that is acceptable to someone else, somewhere else, leaves the true benefits of these systems beyond the reach of most in Africa. There is a growing effort in the United States to produce clinically-relevant interface terminologies mapped to standards. These interface terminologies can be expanded to incorporate the languages and clinical requirements of clinicians in Africa. The adoption of interface terminologies will help bring the value of standard terminology and the resulting benefits of decision-support, data analysis and information retrieval to parts of the world where they are needed most.",

However, it is increasingly difficult to properly access and evaluate the information obtained on the Internet. Search engines are frequently used to find information but suffer either from lack of specificity, or cumbersome requirements for use. Mediated search services have been suggested as a possible alternative. This paper describes one such mediated medical information search service called IMO Health Search.",
