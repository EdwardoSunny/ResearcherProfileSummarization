        "Abstract": "Understanding of immune cell phenotypes associated with inflammatory and immunosuppressive host responses in sepsis is imprecise, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the global sepsis burden is concentrated. In these settings, elucidation of immunophenotypes with prognostic importance is necessary to determine the relevance of emerging therapeutics and refine mechanistic investigations of sepsis immunopathology.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in human genomics technologies have helped uncover genetic risk alleles for many complex autoimmune diseases. Intriguingly, over 90% of genome-wide association study (GWAS) risk alleles reside within the non-coding regions of the genome. An emerging new frontier of functional and mechanistic studies have shed light on the functional relevance of risk alleles that lie within long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Here, we review the mechanisms and functional implications of five evolutionarily conserved lncRNAs that display risk allele association with highly prevalent autoimmune diseases.",

        "Abstract": "The outcome of cancer and autoimmunity is often dictated by the effector functions of CD4+ conventional T cells (Tconv). Although activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway has long been implicated in Tconv biology, the cell-autonomous roles of the separate NF-\u03baB transcription-factor subunits are unknown. Here, we dissected the contributions of the canonical NF-\u03baB subunits RelA and c-Rel to Tconv function. RelA, rather than c-Rel, regulated Tconv activation and cytokine production at steady-state and was required for polarization toward the TH17 lineage in vitro. Accordingly, RelA-deficient mice were fully protected against neuroinflammation in a model of multiple sclerosis due to defective transition to a pathogenic TH17 gene-expression program. Conversely, Tconv-restricted ablation of c-Rel impaired their function in the microenvironment of transplanted tumors, resulting in enhanced cancer burden. Moreover, Tconv required c-Rel for the response to PD-1-blockade therapy. Our data reveal distinct roles for canonical NF-\u03baB subunits in different disease contexts, paving the way for subunit-targeted immunotherapies.",

        "Abstract": "Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor member 1b (RasGEF1b) of the RasGEF/CDC25 domain-containing family is preferentially expressed by macrophages. However, information is lacking about its role in macrophage function. In this study, we generated mice with ubiquitous deletion of Rasgef1b and used RNA-seq-based transcriptomics to compare the global gene expression in wild-type and knock-out primary bone-marrow-derived macrophages under basal conditions and after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. Transcriptional filtering identified several genes with significantly different transcript levels between wild-type and knock-out macrophages. In total, 49 and 37 differentially expressed genes were identified at baseline and in LPS-activated macrophages, respectively. Distinct biological processes were significantly linked to down-regulated genes at the basal condition only, and largely included chemotaxis, response to cytokines, and positive regulation of GTPase activity. Importantly, validation by RT-qPCR revealed that the expression of genes identified as down-regulated after LPS stimulation was also decreased in the knock-out cells under basal conditions. We used a luciferase-based reporter assay to showcase the capability of RasGEF1b in activating the Serpinb2 promoter. Notably, knockdown of RasGEF1b in RAW264.7 macrophages resulted in impaired transcriptional activation of the Serpinb2 promoter, both in constitutive and LPS-stimulated conditions. This study provides a small collection of genes that shows relative expression changes effected by the absence of RasGEF1b in macrophages. Thus, we present the first evidence that RasGEF1b mediates the regulation of both steady-state and signal-dependent expression of genes and propose that this GEF plays a role in the maintenance of the basal transcriptional level in macrophages.",

The \u03baB-Ras proteins were previously shown to inhibit both NF-\u03baB and Ras activation through independent mechanisms, implicating them as tumor suppressors with potentially broad relevance to human cancers. In this study, we have used two mouse models to establish the relevance of the \u03baB-Ras proteins for tumorigenesis. Additionally, we have utilized a pan-cancer bioinformatics analysis to explore the role of the \u03baB-Ras proteins in human cancers. Surprisingly, we find that the genes encoding \u03baB-Ras 1 (",

        "Title": "L-RAPiT: A Cloud-Based Computing Pipeline for the Analysis of Long-Read RNA Sequencing Data.",
        "Abstract": "Long-read sequencing (LRS) has been adopted to meet a wide variety of research needs, ranging from the construction of novel transcriptome annotations to the rapid identification of emerging virus variants. Amongst other advantages, LRS preserves more information about RNA at the transcript level than conventional high-throughput sequencing, including far more accurate and quantitative records of splicing patterns. New studies with LRS datasets are being published at an exponential rate, generating a vast reservoir of information that can be leveraged to address a host of different research questions. However, mining such publicly available data in a tailored fashion is currently not easy, as the available software tools typically require familiarity with the command-line interface, which constitutes a significant obstacle to many researchers. Additionally, different research groups utilize different software packages to perform LRS analysis, which often prevents a direct comparison of published results across different studies. To address these challenges, we have developed the Long-Read Analysis Pipeline for Transcriptomics (L-RAPiT), a user-friendly, free pipeline requiring no dedicated computational resources or bioinformatics expertise. L-RAPiT can be implemented directly through Google Colaboratory, a system based on the open-source Jupyter notebook environment, and allows for the direct analysis of transcriptomic reads from Oxford Nanopore and PacBio LRS machines. This new pipeline enables the rapid, convenient, and standardized analysis of publicly available or newly generated LRS datasets.",

        "Abstract": "Although skeletal progenitors provide a reservoir for bone-forming osteoblasts, the major energy source for their osteogenesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate a requirement for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the osteogenic commitment and differentiation of skeletal progenitors. Deletion of Evolutionarily Conserved Signaling Intermediate in Toll pathways (ECSIT) in skeletal progenitors hinders bone formation and regeneration, resulting in skeletal deformity, defects in the bone marrow niche and spontaneous fractures followed by persistent nonunion. Upon skeletal fracture, Ecsit-deficient skeletal progenitors migrate to adjacent skeletal muscle causing muscle atrophy. These phenotypes are intrinsic to ECSIT function in skeletal progenitors, as little skeletal abnormalities were observed in mice lacking Ecsit in committed osteoprogenitors or mature osteoblasts. Mechanistically, Ecsit deletion in skeletal progenitors impairs mitochondrial complex assembly and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and elevates glycolysis. ECSIT-associated skeletal phenotypes were reversed by in vivo reconstitution with wild-type ECSIT expression, but not a mutant displaying defective mitochondrial localization. Collectively, these findings identify mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as the prominent energy-driving force for osteogenesis of skeletal progenitors, governing musculoskeletal integrity.",

        "Abstract": "Cat domestication likely initiated as a symbiotic relationship between wildcats (Felis silvestris subspecies) and the peoples of developing agrarian societies in the Fertile Crescent. As humans transitioned from hunter-gatherers to farmers ~12,000 years ago, bold wildcats likely capitalized on increased prey density (i.e., rodents). Humans benefited from the cats' predation on these vermin. To refine the site(s) of cat domestication, over 1000 random-bred cats of primarily Eurasian descent were genotyped for single-nucleotide variants and short tandem repeats. The overall cat population structure suggested a single worldwide population with significant isolation by the distance of peripheral subpopulations. The cat population heterozygosity decreased as genetic distance from the proposed cat progenitor's (F.s. lybica) natural habitat increased. Domestic cat origins are focused in the eastern Mediterranean Basin, spreading to nearby islands, and southernly via the Levantine coast into the Nile Valley. Cat population diversity supports the migration patterns of humans and other symbiotic species.",

        "Abstract": "Cancer malignancies require the application of advanced strategies leading to the development of novel theranostic. Quite often drugs target a variety of receptors in the cell signaling cascades that could be explored to combat aggressive tumors. Herein, two receptors that are over-expressed during the diagnosis of breast cancer are used as the primary drug targets, inclusively Glycogen Synthase kinase -3 beta (GSK-3\u0392) and Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa kinase-beta (IKK-\u03b2). Dual-targeting inhibitors pave the way for a challenging pathway in the treatment of aberrant tumor progression. The present study involves the observation of similarities in the structure of the receptors, along with the designing of novel therapeutics that act on them by molecular docking followed by a pharmacokinetic screening approach. A 3D QSAR modeling study is performed to approach the functionality of the bioactive conformer molecules. Additionally, Molecular Dynamic Simulation parameters are used for the validation of the drug complexes. Already available inhibitors are used as reference compounds and a library of analogs generated for these compounds from the PubChem database has been used for in silico designing of novel inhibitors. Molecular Docking and ADME analysis narrowed down the vast library of compounds to two specific classes of chemical compounds. Molecular Dynamic simulation studies used for the selection of the novel moieties showed significant superiority in their stability studies and binding trajectories resulted in two novel molecules A6 and B3 that could inhibit the kinase receptors. The current work involves computational designing of therapeutics targeting two major oncogenic proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many loci contributing to genetic variation of complex traits. Immune mediated disorders are complex diseases for which hundreds of risk alleles have been identified by GWAS. However, the intergenic location of most of the signals has make it difficult to decipher their implication in disease pathogenesis. A significant number of immune disease-associated SNPs are located within long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs have gained importance due to their involvement in the regulation of a wide range of biological processes, including immune responses. GWAS SNPs located within lncRNAs can affect their regulatory capacity by modifying their secondary structure, altering their expression levels or regulating the transcription of different isoforms. In this review we discuss the functional implications of immune-related lncRNAs harboring disease associated SNPs on various disease conditions.",

        "Title": "Metformin selectively dampens the acute inflammatory response through an AMPK-dependent mechanism.",
        "Abstract": "Metformin is a first-line drug in the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition to its antigluconeogenic and insulin-sensitizing properties, metformin has emerged as a potent inhibitor of the chronic inflammatory response of macrophages. In particular, metformin treatment has been shown to reduce expression of interleukin (IL-) 1\u03b2 during long-term exposure to the pro-inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which decreases the levels of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1-\u03b1, and through enhanced expression of IL-10. However, the effect of metformin on the acute inflammatory response, before significant levels of ROS accumulate in the cell, has not been explored. Here, we show that metformin alters the acute inflammatory response through its activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but independently of HIF1-\u03b1 and IL-10, in primary macrophages and two macrophage-like cell lines. Thus, metformin changes the acute and the chronic inflammatory response through fundamentally distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis reveals that metformin pretreatment affects the levels of a large yet selective subset of inflammatory genes, dampening the response to short-term LPS exposure and affecting a wide range of pathways and biological functions. Taken together, these findings reveal an unexpected complexity in the anti-inflammatory properties of this widely used drug.",

Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is a pleiotropic kinase that acts as a key effector downstream of PI3K in many cell types. In T cells, PDK1 has been shown to be critical for activation of NF-\u03baB and AKT signaling upon TCR ligation and is therefore essential for effector T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production. Using Treg cell-specific conditional deletion, we now demonstrate that PDK1 is also essential for Treg cell suppressive activity in vivo. Ablation of ",

        "Abstract": "The \u03b2-cell response to injury may be as critical for the development of diabetes as the specific insult. In the current study, we used streptozotocin (STZ) to injure the \u03b2-cell in order to study the response with a focus on NF\u03baB. MIN6 cells were exposed to STZ (0.5-8 mM, 0-24h) \u00b1TNF\u03b1 (100 ng/mL) and \u00b1I\u03baB\u03b2 siRNA to lower the threshold to NF\u03baB activation. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. NF\u03baB activation was determined by the expression of the target genes Nos2 and Cxcl10, localization of the NF\u03baB proteins p65 and p50, and expression and localization of the NF\u03baB inhibitors, I\u03baB\u03b2 and I\u03baB\u03b1. There was no NF\u03baB activation in MIN6 cell exposed to STZ (2 mM) alone. However, knocking down I\u03baB\u03b2 expression using siRNA resulted in STZ-induced expression of NF\u03baB target genes and increased cell death, while co-incubation with STZ and TNF\u03b1 enhanced cell death compared to either exposure alone. Adult male I\u03baB\u03b2-/- and WT mice were exposed to STZ and monitored for diabetes. The I\u03baB\u03b2-/- mice developed hyperglycemia and diabetes more frequently than controls following STZ exposure. Based on these results we conclude that STZ exposure alone does not induce NF\u03baB activity. However, lowering the threshold to NF\u03baB activation by co-incubation with TNF\u03b1 or lowering I\u03baB\u03b2 levels by siRNA sensitizes the NF\u03baB response to STZ and results in a higher likelihood of developing diabetes in vivo. Therefore, increasing the threshold to NF\u03baB activation through stabilizing NF\u03baB inhibitory proteins may prevent \u03b2-cell injury and the development of diabetes.",

In addition to lymphoid cells, myeloid cells play essential roles in controlling immunity to cancer. Whether myeloid checkpoints exist that can be targeted to treat cancer is not well established. Here we show that c-Rel, a member of the nuclear factor (NF)-B family, specified the generation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) by selectively turning on pro-tumoral genes while switching off anti-tumoral genes through a c-Rel enhanceosome. c-Rel deficiency in myeloid cells markedly inhibited cancer growth in mice, and pharmaceutical inhibition of c-Rel had the same effect. Combination therapy that blocked both c-Rel and the lymphoid checkpoint protein PD1 was more effective in treating cancer than blocking either alone. Thus, c-Rel is a myeloid checkpoint that can be targeted for treating cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Ras Guanine Exchange Factor (RasGEF) domain family member 1b is encoded by a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-inducible gene expressed in macrophages, but transcriptional mechanisms that govern its expression are still unknown. Here, we have functionally characterized the 5' flanking Rasgef1b sequence and analyzed its transcriptional activation. We have identified that the inflammation-responsive promoter is contained within a short sequence (-183 to +119) surrounding the transcriptional start site. The promoter sequence is evolutionarily conserved and harbors a cluster of five NF-\u03baB binding sites. Luciferase reporter gene assay showed that the promoter is responsive to TLR activation and RelA or cRel, but not RelB, transcription factors. Besides, site-directed mutagenesis showed that the \u03baB binding sites are required for maximal promoter activation induced by LPS. Analysis by Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) revealed that the promoter is located in an accessible chromatin region. More important, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) showed that RelA is recruited to the promoter region upon LPS stimulation of bone marrow-derived macrophages. Finally, studies with Rela-deficient macrophages or pharmacological inhibition by Bay11-7082 showed that NF-\u03baB is required for optimal Rasgef1b expression induced by TLR agonists. Our data provide evidence of the regulatory mechanism mediated by NF-\u03baB that facilitates Rasgef1b expression after TLR activation in macrophages.",

        "Title": "Drug repurposing and relabeling for cancer therapy: Emerging benzimidazole antihelminthics with potent anticancer effects.",
        "Abstract": "Origin of drug and radio-refractory clones, cancer stem-like cells, and rapid angiogenesis and metastasis are among the primary concerns that limit the efficacy of anticancer treatments, emphasizing the urgency of developing new therapeutics. Factors like high attrition rates, huge investments, patients' heterogeneity, and diverse molecular subtypes have challenged the rapid development of anticancer drugs. Treatment with repurposing pleiotropic benzimidazole antihelminthics, like mebendazole, albendazole, and flubendazole has recently opened a new window, owing to their easy access, low cost as a generic drug, and long track record of safe use in the human population. This review highlights the outcomes of preclinical and clinical studies of these drugs as a potent anticancer agent(s) conducted in the last two decades. Substantial preclinical studies, as well as limited clinical trials, suggest noteworthy anticancer potency of these pleiotropic benzimidazoles, particularly as potent microtubule disrupting, anti-angiogenic, and anti-metastatic agents, inhibitors of the immune checkpoint, hypoxia-inducible factor, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cancer stemness, and multidrug resistance protein 1, and inducers of apoptosis and M1 polarization. These anticancer effects are attributed to multiple action points, including intrinsic apoptosis, canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, JAK/STAT-3, JNK, MEK/ERK, and hedgehog signaling pathways. The effective anticancer properties of mebendazole, albendazole, and flubendazole either alone or synergistically with frontline drugs, warrant their validation through controlled clinical trials to use them as promising avenues to anticancer therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Sterile inflammation contributes to many pathological states associated with mitochondrial injury. Mitochondrial injury disrupts calcium homeostasis and results in the release of CpG-rich mitochondrial DNA. The role of CpG-stimulated TLR9 innate immune signalling and sterile inflammation is well studied; however, how calcium dyshomeostasis affects this signalling is unknown. Therefore, we interrogated the relationship be\u03c4ween intracellular calcium and CpG-induced TLR9 signalling in murine macrophages. We found that CpG-ODN-induced NF\u03baB-dependent IL1\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2 expression was significantly attenuated by both calcium chelation and calcineurin inhibition, a finding mediated by inhibition of degradation of the NF\u03baB inhibitory protein I\u03baB\u03b2. In contrast, calcium ionophore exposure increased CpG-induced I\u03baB\u03b2 degradation and IL1\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2 expression. These results demonstrate that through its effect on I\u03baB\u03b2 degradation, increased intracellular Ca",

        "Abstract": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common morbidity complicating premature birth. Importantly, preclinical models have demonstrated that IL-1 receptor antagonism prevents the lung injury and subsequent abnormal development that typically results following perinatal exposure to inflammatory stresses. This receptor is activated by two pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. While many studies have linked IL-1\u03b2 to BPD development, IL-1\u03b1 is relatively under-studied. The objective of our study was to determine whether systemic inflammatory stress induces IL-1\u03b1 expression in the neonatal lung, and if so, whether this expression is mediated by innate immune NF\u03baB signaling. We found that endotoxemia induced IL-1\u03b1 expression during the saccular stage of neonatal lung development and was not present in the other neonatal organs or the adult lung. This IL-1\u03b1 expression was dependent upon sustained pulmonary NF\u03baB activation, which was specific to the neonatal lung. Using ",

        "Title": "Genetic status of indigenous poultry (red jungle fowl) from India.",
        "Abstract": "The global biodiversity of domesticated red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus) is gradually eroding by replacement with commercial poultry breeds and results loss of valuable genetic and physical traits like resistance to disease, extreme environment, etc. posing a threat to the poultry genetic resources. Very fewer reports exist on Indian poultry diversity, especially native chicken of India. Therefore, species identification and inventorying of the poultry genetic resource is indispensable. Thus, the present study aimed to characterize indigenous chicken from bio-diversity hotspot of Sunderban and Northeast India using DNA sequence based barcoding approach. A total of 15 CO1 (Cytochrome c Oxidase-I) DNA barcode of different indigenous chicken were newly sequenced along with 6 previously published sequences from our laboratory and compared with the available data of distinctive genera of Phasianidae as per the standard protocol and are identified as Gallus gallus. About 98.96% of the Phasianid birds were successfully delimitated into the respective species except for 12 congeneric pairs whose minimum interspecific K2P (Kimura 2-parameter) distance overlaps with the maximum intraspecific distance (3.9%). The least genetic divergence is observed between G. gallus and G. varius (0.013%) and highest between G. gallus and G. lafayettei (0.059%). The NJ tree showed a cohesive clustering of indigenous chicken with G. gallus and distinct with respect to all the different species under study, thereby revealing their taxonomic position except for few G. sonneratti that showed mixed clustering with G. gallus. This may be due to the genetic introgression between the species. Nevertheless, the study for the first time provided the molecular identification tag of indigenous poultry from biodiversity hotspot of East and Northeast India and will remain as a potential guide to recognize inimitable and valuable poultry genetic resources for future needs.",

        "Abstract": "Immune-mediated diseases, such as celiac disease, type 1 diabetes or multiple sclerosis, are a clinically heterogeneous group of diseases that share many key genetic triggers. Although the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the development of immune mediated disorders is not totally understood, high-throughput genomic studies, such as GWAS and Immunochip, performed in the past few years have provided intriguing hints about underlying mechanisms and pathways that lead to disease. More than a hundred gene variants associated with disease susceptibility have been identified through such studies, but the progress toward understanding the underlying mechanisms has been slow. The majority of the identified risk variants are located in non-coding regions of the genome making it difficult to assign a molecular function to the SNPs. However, recent studies have revealed that many of the non-coding regions bearing disease-associated SNPs generate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs have been implicated in several inflammatory diseases, and many of them have been shown to function as regulators of gene expression. Many of the disease associated SNPs located in lncRNAs modify their secondary structure, or influence expression levels, thereby affecting their regulatory function, hence contributing to the development of disease.",

        "Title": "Both knock-down and overexpression of Rap2a small GTPase in macrophages result in impairment of NF-\u03baB activity and inflammatory gene expression.",
        "Abstract": "Small Ras GTPases are key molecules that regulate a variety of cellular responses in different cell types. Rap1 plays important functions in the regulation of macrophage biology during inflammation triggered by toll-like receptors (TLRs). However, despite sharing a relatively high degree of similarity with Rap1, no studies concerning Rap2 in macrophages and innate immunity have been reported yet. In this work, we show that either way alterations in the levels of Rap2a hampers proper macrophages response to TLR stimulation. Rap2a is activated by LPS in macrophages, and although putative activator TLR-inducible Ras guanine exchange factor RasGEF1b was sufficient to induce, it was not fully required for Rap2a activation. Silencing of Rap2a impaired LPS-induced production of IL-6 cytokine and KC/Cxcl1 chemokine, and also NF-\u03baB activity as measured by reporter gene studies. Surprisingly, overexpression of Rap2a did also lead to marked inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation induced by LPS, Pam3CSK4 and downstream TLR signaling molecules. We also found that Rap2a can inhibit the LPS-induced phosphorylation of the NF-\u03baB subunit p65 at serine 536. Collectively, our data suggest that expression levels of Rap2a in macrophages might be tightly regulated to avoid unbalanced immune response. Our results implicate Rap2a in TLR-mediated responses by contributing to balanced NF-\u03baB activity status in macrophages.",

        "Title": "Association of DFNA5, SYK, and NELL1 variants along with HPV infection in oral cancer among the prolonged tobacco-chewers.",
        "Abstract": "Southeast Asia, especially India, is well known for the highest use of smokeless tobacco. These products are known to induce oral squamous cell carcinoma. However, not all long-term tobacco-chewers develop oral squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, germline variants play a crucial role in susceptibility, prognosis, development, and progression of the disease. These prompted us to study the genetic susceptibility to oral squamous cell carcinoma among the long-term tobacco-chewers. Here, we presented a retrospective study on prolonged tobacco-chewers of Northeast India to identify the potential protective or risk-associated germline variants in tobacco-related oral squamous cell carcinoma along with HPV infection. Targeted re-sequencing (n\u2009=\u200960) of 170 genetic regions from 75 genes was carried out in Ion-PGM\u2122 and validation (n\u2009=\u2009116) of the observed variants was done using Sequenom iPLEX MassARRAY\u2122 platform followed by polymerase chain reaction-based HPV genotyping and p16-immunohistochemistry study. Subsequently, estimation of population structure, different statistical and in silico approaches were undertaken. We identified one nonsense-mediated mRNA decay transcript variant in the DFNA5 region (rs2237306), associated with Benzo(a)pyrene, as a protective factor (odds ratio\u2009=\u20090.33; p\u2009=\u20090.009) and four harmful (odds ratio\u2009>\u20092.5; p\u2009<\u20090.05) intronic variants, rs182361, rs290974, and rs169724 in SYK and rs1670661 in NELL1 region, involved in genetic susceptibility to tobacco- and HPV-mediated oral oncogenesis. Among the oral squamous cell carcinoma patients, 12.6% (11/87) were HPV positive, out of which 45.5% (5/11) were HPV16-infected, 27.3% (3/11) were HPV18-infected, and 27.3% (3/11) had an infection of both subtypes. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis showed that the interactions among HPV and NELL1 variant rs1670661 with age and gender augmented the risk of both non-tobacco- and tobacco-related oral squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. These suggest that HPV infection may be one of the important risk factors for oral squamous cell carcinoma in this population. Finally, we newly report a DFNA5 variant probably conferring protection via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway against tobacco-related oral squamous cell carcinoma. Thus, the analytical approach used here can be useful in predicting the population-specific significant variants associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma in any heterogeneous population.",

        "Title": "Assessment of DNA repair susceptibility genes identified by whole exome sequencing in head and neck cancer.",
        "Abstract": "Head and neck cancer (HNC), the sixth most common cancer globally, stands second in India. In Northeast (NE) India, it is the sixth most common cause of death in males and seventh in females. Prolonged tobacco and alcohol consumption constitute the major etiological factors for HNC development, which induce DNA damage. Therefore, DNA repair pathway is a crucial system in maintaining genomic integrity and preventing carcinogenesis. The present work was aimed to predict the consequence of significant germline variants of the DNA repair genes in disease predisposition. Whole exome sequencing was performed in Ion Proton\u2122 platform on 15 case-control samples from the HNC-prevalent states of Manipur, Mizoram, and Nagaland. Variant annotation was done in Ion Reporter\u2122 as well as wANNOVAR. Subsequent statistical and bioinformatics analysis identified significant exonic and intronic variants associated with HNC. Amongst our observed variants, 78.6% occurred in ExAC, 94% reported in dbSNP and 5.8% & 9.3% variants were present in ClinVar and HGMD, respectively. The total variants were dispersed among 199 genes with DSBR and FA pathway being the most mutated pathways. The allelic association test suggested that the intronic variants in HLTF and RAD52 gene significantly associated (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) with the risk (OR\u202f>\u202f5), while intronic variants in PARP4, RECQL5, EXO1 and PER1 genes and exonic variant in TDP2 gene showed protection (OR\u202f<\u202f1) for HNC. MDR analysis proposed the exonic variants in MSH6, BRCA2, PALB2 and TP53 genes and intronic variant in RECQL5 genetic region working together during certain phase of DNA repair mechanism for HNC causation. In addition, other intronic and 3'UTR variations caused modifications in the transcription factor binding sites and miRNA target sites associated with HNC. Large-scale validation in NE Indian population, in-depth structure prediction and subsequent simulation of our recognized polymorphisms is necessary to identify true causal variants related to HNC.",

        "Abstract": "ECSIT is a mitochondrial complex I (CI)-associated protein that has been shown to regulate the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) following engagement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We have generated an Ecsit conditional knockout (CKO) mouse strain to study the in\u00a0vivo role of ECSIT. ECSIT deletion results in profound alteration of macrophage metabolism, leading to a striking shift to reliance on glycolysis, complete disruption of CI activity, and loss of the CI holoenzyme and multiple subassemblies. An increase in constitutive mROS production in ECSIT-deleted macrophages prevents further TLR-induced mROS production. Surprisingly, ECSIT-deleted cells accumulate damaged mitochondria because of defective mitophagy. ECSIT associates with the mitophagy regulator PINK1 and exhibits Parkin-dependent ubiquitination. However, upon ECSIT deletion, we observed increased mitochondrial Parkin without the expected increase in mitophagy. Taken together, these results demonstrate a key role of ECSIT in CI function, mROS production, and mitophagy-dependent mitochondrial quality control.",

        "Abstract": "The conventional method of measuring biomarkers in malignant tissue samples has already given subversive growth in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy selection. However, the regression and heterogeneity associated with tumor tissue biopsy have urged for the development of an alternative approach. Considering the limitations, cell-free DNA has emerged as a surrogate alternative, facilitating preoperative chemoradiotherapy (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) treatment response in rectal cancer and detection of biomarker in lung cancer. This potential of cell-free DNA in several other cancers has yet to be explored based on clinical relevance by optimizing the preanalytical factors. This review has highlighted the crucial parameters from blood collection to cell-free DNA analysis that has a significant impact on the accuracy and reliability of clinical data. The quantity of cell-free DNA is also a limiting factor. Therefore, a proper preanalytical factor for blood collection, its stability, centrifugation speed, and plasma storage condition are to be optimized for developing cancer-specific biomarkers useful for clinical purpose. Liquid biopsy-based origin of cell-free DNA has revolutionized the area of cancer research. Lack of preanalytical and analytical procedures may be considered for identification of novel biomarkers through next-generation sequencing of tumor-originated cell-free DNA in contradiction to tissue biopsy for cancer-specific biomarkers.",

        "Abstract": "DNA methylation plays a decisive role in the regulation and control of gene expression. DNA methylation is a covalent modification, in which a methyl group is attached to the 5th carbon of the cytosine ring of a CpG dinucleotide that is located upstream from the promoter region of a gene. Promoter hypermethylation (gain of DNA methylation) of the p16 gene may cause silencing of gene expression and plays an important role in cancer. Therefore, detection of the methylation status of p16 gene is an important tool in epigenetic studies of various human cancers. The methylation-specific PCR (MSP) is the most commonly used technique for studying DNA methylation. This technique is based on bisulfite modification of DNA, which converts unmethylated cytosine (C) into uracil (U) and leaving methylated cytosine (C",

        "Abstract": "Excessive expression of Tbet and IFN\u03b3 is evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in lupus patients. In this study, the nucleus-transducible form of Transcription Modulation Domain (TMD) of Tbet (ntTbet-TMD), which is a fusion protein between Protein Transduction Domain Hph-1 (Hph-1-PTD) and the TMD of Tbet comprising DNA binding domain and isotype-specific domain, was generated to inhibit Tbet-mediated transcription in the interactomic manner. ntTbet-TMD was effectively delivered into the nucleus of the cells and specifically inhibited Tbet-mediated transcription without influencing the differentiation of other T cell subsets and signaling events for T cell activation. The severity of nephritis was significantly reduced by ntTbet-TMD as effectively as methylprednisolone in lupus-prone mice. The number of Th1, Th2 or Th17 cells and the secretion of their cytokines substantially decreased in the spleen and kidney of lupus-prone mice by ntTbet-TMD treatment. In contrast to methylprednisolone, the marked increase of Treg cells and the secretion of their immunosuppressive cytokine were detected in the spleen of (NZB/NZW) F1 mice treated with\u00a0ntTbet-TMD. Thus, ntTbet-TMD can improve nephritis\u00a0in lupus-prone mice by modulating the overall proinflammatory microenvironment and rebalancing T\u00a0cell subsets, leading to new immune therapeutics for Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. The lifestyle, food habits, and customary practices manifest the Northeast Indian population toward higher susceptibility to develop head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Here, we have investigated the association of smoke and smokeless tobacco, and alcohol with copy number variation of cell-free mitochondrial DNA and cell-free nuclear DNA in cases and controls. Cell-free DNA from plasma was isolated from 50 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cases and 50 controls with informed written consent using QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was done for copy number variation in cell-free mitochondrial DNA and cell-free nuclear DNA. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic application between the two study groups using clinicopathological parameters. The levels of cell-free nuclear DNA and cell-free mitochondrial DNA of cases in association with smoke and smokeless tobacco, alcohol with smoking (p\u2009<\u20090.05) were significantly higher (p\u2009<\u20090.01 and p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively) than controls. Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis between head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cases and controls, we distinguished cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cutoff: 19.84 raw Ct; sensitivity: 84%; specificity: 100%; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and cell-free nuclear DNA (cutoff: 463,282\u2009genomic equivalent/mL; sensitivity: 53%; specificity: 87%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). The copy number variation in cases (cell-free nuclear DNA: 5451.66\u2009genomic equivalent/mL and cell-free mitochondrial DNA: 29,103,476.15\u2009genomic equivalent/mL) and controls (cell-free nuclear DNA: 1650.9\u2009genomic equivalent/mL and cell-free mitochondrial DNA: 9,189,312.54\u2009genomic equivalent/mL), respectively. Our result indicates that the cell-free mitochondrial DNA content is highly associated with smoke and smokeless tobacco, betel quid chewing, and alcohol which shows greater promises, holding the key characteristics of diagnostic biomarkers, that is, minimal invasiveness, high specificity, and sensitivity.",

        "Abstract": "Multiple genetic and environmental factors and their interaction are believed to contribute in the pathogenesis of Nasopharyngeal Cancer (NPC). We investigate the role of Metabolic Phase I (CYPs) and Phase II (GSTs) gene polymorphisms, gene-gene and gene-environmental interaction in modulating the susceptibility to NPC in Northeast India. To determine the association of metabolic gene polymorphisms and environmental habits, 123 cases and 189 controls blood/swab samples were used for PCR and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Analysis for GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphism was done by multiplex PCR. The T3801C in the 3'- flanking region of CYP1A1 gene was detected by PCR-RFLP method. The Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The GSTM1 null genotype alone (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.76) was significantly associated with NPC risk (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The combinations of GSTM1 null and GSTT1 null genotypes also higher, 3.77 fold (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), risk of NPC, while GSTM1 null genotype along with CYP1A1 T3801C TC\u00a0+\u00a0CC genotype had 3.22 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) fold risk. The most remarkable risk was seen among individual carrying GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null genotypes and CYP1A1 T3801C TC\u00a0+\u00a0CC genotypes (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.71, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Further; analyses demonstrate an enhanced risk of NPC in smoked meat (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.56, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and fermented fish consumers (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.73, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) carrying GSTM1 null genotype. An elevated risk of NPC was noted in smokers (OR\u00a0=\u00a012.67, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and chewers (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.68, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) with GSTM1 null genotype. However, smokers had the highest risk of NPC among individuals carrying GSTT1 null genotype (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.46, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) or CYP1A1 T3801C TC\u00a0+\u00a0CC genotype (OR\u00a0=\u00a07.13, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The association of null genotypes and mutations of metabolic neutralizing genes along with the environmental habits (tobacco smokers and chewers, smoke meat, fermented fishes) can be used as a possible biomarker for early detection and preventive measure of NPC.",

        "Abstract": "Both conventional T (Tconv) cells and regulatory T\u00a0(Treg) cells are activated through ligation of the T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR) complex, leading to the induction of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. In Tconv cells, NF-\u03baB regulates expression of genes essential for T\u00a0cell activation, proliferation, and function. However the role of NF-\u03baB in Treg function remains unclear. We conditionally deleted canonical NF-\u03baB members p65 and c-Rel in developing and mature Treg cells and found they have unique but partially redundant roles. c-Rel was critical for thymic Treg development while p65 was essential for mature Treg identity and maintenance of immune tolerance. Transcriptome and NF-\u03baB p65 binding analyses demonstrated a lineage specific, NF-\u03baB-dependent transcriptional program, enabled by enhanced chromatin accessibility. These dual roles of canonical NF-\u03baB in Tconv and Treg cells highlight the functional plasticity of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and underscores the need for more selective strategies to therapeutically target NF-\u03baB.",

        "Abstract": "Regulatory T\u00a0cells (Tregs) play a pivotal role in the inhibition of anti-tumor immune responses. Understanding the mechanisms governing Treg homeostasis may therefore be important for development of effective tumor immunotherapy. We have recently demonstrated a key role for the canonical nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) subunits, p65 and c-Rel, in Treg identity and function. In this report, we show that NF-\u03baB c-Rel ablation specifically impairs the generation and maintenance of the activated Treg (aTreg) subset, which is known to be enriched at sites of tumors. Using mouse models, we demonstrate that melanoma growth is drastically reduced in mice lacking c-Rel, but not p65, in Tregs. Moreover, chemical inhibition of c-Rel function delayed melanoma growth by impairing aTreg-mediated immunosuppression and potentiated the effects of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Our studies therefore establish inhibition of NF-\u03baB c-Rel as a viable therapeutic approach for enhancing checkpoint-targeting immunotherapy protocols.",

Here, we describe a meta-analysis of two independent RNA-seq studies to identify lncRNAs that are differentially expressed upon HIV-1 infection. Only three lncRNA genes exhibited altered expression of \u2265 2-fold in HIV-1-infected cells. Of these, the uncharacterized lncRNA LINC00173 was chosen for further study. Both transcript variants of LINC00173 (lnc173 TSV1 and 2) could be detected by qPCR, localized predominantly to the nucleus and were reproducibly up-regulated during infection. Knock-out of the LINC00173 locus did not have detectable effects on HIV-1 replication. Interestingly, however, stimulation of Jurkat T cells with PMA/ionomycin resulted in a decrease of lnc173 expression, and Jurkat cells deficient for lnc173 on average expressed higher levels of specific cytokines than control cells. These data suggest that lnc173 may have a role in the regulation of cytokines in T cells.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundThe pro-inflammatory consequences of IL1\u03b2 expression contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Selectively targeting Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced I\u03baB\u03b2/NF\u03baB signaling attenuates IL1\u03b2 mRNA expression in macrophages. Whether targeting I\u03baB\u03b2/NF\u03baB signaling affects the anti-apoptotic gene expression, a known consequence of global LPS-induced NF\u03baB inhibition, is unknown.MethodsMacrophages (RAW 264.7, bone marrow-derived macrophage) were assessed for LPS-induced IL1\u03b2 mRNA/protein expression, anti-apoptotic gene expression, cell viability (trypan blue exclusion), and activation of apoptosis (caspase-3 and PARP cleavage) following pharmacologic and genetic attenuation of I\u03baB\u03b2/NF\u03baB signaling. Expressions of IL1\u03b2 and anti-apoptotic genes were assessed in endotoxemic newborn mice (P0) with intact (WT), absent (I\u03baB\u03b2 KO), and attenuated (I\u03baB\u03b2 overexpressing) I\u03baB\u03b2/NF\u03baB signaling.ResultsIn cultured macrophages, pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of LPS-induced I\u03baB\u03b2/NF\u03baB signaling significantly attenuated IL1\u03b2 mRNA and protein expression. Importantly, targeting I\u03baB\u03b2/NF\u03baB signaling did not attenuate LPS-induced expression of anti-apoptotic genes or result in cell death. In endotoxemic neonatal mice, targeting LPS-induced I\u03baB\u03b2/NF\u03baB signaling significantly attenuated pulmonary IL1\u03b2 expression without affecting the anti-apoptotic gene expression.ConclusionTargeting I\u03baB\u03b2/NF\u03baB signaling prevents LPS-induced IL1\u03b2 expression without inducing apoptosis in cultured macrophages and in the lungs of endotoxemic newborn mice. Inhibiting this pathway may prevent inflammatory injury without affecting the protective role of NF\u03baB activity in the developing lung.",

        "Abstract": "The ornamental fishes were exported under the trade names or generic names, thus creating problems in species identification. In this regard, DNA barcoding could effectively elucidate the actual species status. However, the problem arises if the specimen is having taxonomic disputes, falsified by trade/generic names, etc., On the other hand, barcoding the archival museum specimens would be of greater benefit to address such issues as it would create firm, error-free reference database for rapid identification of any species. This can be achieved only by generating short sequences as DNA from chemically preserved are mostly degraded. Here we aimed to identify a short stretch of informative sites within the full-length barcode segment, capable of delineating diverse group of ornamental fish species, commonly traded from NE India. We analyzed 287 full-length barcode sequences from the major fish orders and compared the interspecific K2P distance with nucleotide substitutions patterns and found a strong correlation of interspecies distance with transversions (0.95, p<0.001). We, therefore, proposed a short stretch of 171bp (transversion rich) segment as mini-barcode. The proposed segment was compared with the full-length barcodes and found to delineate the species effectively. Successful PCR amplification and sequencing of the 171bp segment using designed primers for different orders validated it as mini-barcodes for ornamental fishes. Thus, our findings would be helpful in strengthening the global database with the sequence of archived fish species as well as an effective identification tool of the traded ornamental fish species, as a less time consuming, cost effective field-based application.",

        "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of inflammation. To further understand the interaction between inflammatory signaling pathways and lncRNAs, we characterized the function of cardiac and apoptosis-related lncRNA (Carlr), an lncRNA expressed in both mouse and human cells of diverse tissues. Carlr expression is increased following NF-\u03baB signaling in macrophages, with concomitant translocation to, and enrichment of, the transcript in the cytoplasm. Knockdown of Carlr results in impaired expression of NF-\u03baB pathway genes and influences the interaction between macrophages and intestinal cells in an inflammatory environment. In human celiac disease patient samples, increased levels of the Carlr transcript were detected in the cytoplasm, alongside elevated expression of NF-\u03baB pathway genes. These findings suggest that increased Carlr expression and/or cytoplasmic localization is required for efficient NF-\u03baB signaling and is associated with the inflamed tissue state observed in human celiac disease.",

Disruptions to the microbiome have been shown to be associated with severe pathologies of the host, including metabolic disease, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Mood and behavior are also susceptible to alterations in the gut microbiota. A particularly striking example of the symbiotic effects of the microbiome is the immune system, whose cells depend critically on a diverse array of microbial metabolites for normal development and behavior. This includes metabolites that are produced by bacteria from dietary components, metabolites that are produced by the host and biochemically modified by gut bacteria, and metabolites that are synthesized de novo by gut microbes. In this review, we highlight the role of the intestinal microbiome in human metabolic and inflammatory diseases and focus in particular on the molecular mechanisms that govern the gut-immune axis.",

        "Title": "Design of character-based DNA barcode motif for species identification: A computational approach and its validation in fishes.",
        "Abstract": "The DNA barcodes are generally interpreted using distance-based and character-based methods. The former uses clustering of comparable groups, based on the relative genetic distance, while the latter is based on the presence or absence of discrete nucleotide substitutions. The distance-based approach has a limitation in defining a universal species boundary across the taxa as the rate of mtDNA evolution is not constant throughout the taxa. However, character-based approach more accurately defines this using a unique set of nucleotide characters. The character-based analysis of full-length barcode has some inherent limitations, like sequencing of the full-length barcode, use of a sparse-data matrix and lack of a uniform diagnostic position for each group. A short continuous stretch of a fragment can be used to resolve the limitations. Here, we observe that a 154-bp fragment, from the transversion-rich domain of 1367 COI barcode sequences can successfully delimit species in the three most diverse orders of freshwater fishes. This fragment is used to design species-specific barcode motifs for 109 species by the character-based method, which successfully identifies the correct species using a pattern-matching program. The motifs also correctly identify geographically isolated population of the Cypriniformes species. Further, this region is validated as a species-specific mini-barcode for freshwater fishes by successful PCR amplification and sequencing of the motif (154\u00a0bp) using the designed primers. We anticipate that use of such motifs will enhance the diagnostic power of DNA barcode, and the mini-barcode approach will greatly benefit the field-based system of rapid species identification.",

        "Title": "Genetic assessment of leech species from yak (Bos grunniens) in the tract of Northeast India.",
        "Abstract": "Yak is an iconic symbol of Tibet and high altitudes of Northeast India. It is highly cherished for milk, meat, and skin. However, yaks suffer drastic change in milk production, weight loss, etc, when infested by parasites. Among them, infestation by leeches is a serious problem in the Himalayan belt of Northeast India. The parasite feeds on blood externally or from body orifices, like nasopharynx, oral, rectum, etc. But there has been limited data about the leech species infesting the yak in that region because of the difficulties in morphological identification due to plasticity of the body, changes in shape, and surface structure and thus, warrants for the molecular characterization of leech. In anticipation, this study would be influential in proper identification of leech species infesting yak track and also helpful in inventorying of leech species in Northeast India. Here, we investigated, through combined approach of molecular markers and morphological parameters for the identification of leech species infesting yak. The DNA sequences of COI barcode fragment, 18S and 28S rDNA, were analyzed for species identification. The generated sequences were subjected to similarity match in global database and analyzed further through Neighbour-Joining, K2P distance based as well as ML approach. Among the three markers, only COI was successful in delineating species whereas the 18S and 28S failed to delineate the species. Our study confirmed the presence of the species from genus Hirudinaria, Haemadipsa, Whitmania, and one species Myxobdella annandalae, which has not been previously reported from this region.",

        "Abstract": "DNA repair pathway is a primary defense system that eliminates wide varieties of DNA damage. Any deficiencies in them are likely to cause the chromosomal instability that leads to cell malfunctioning and tumorigenesis. Genetic polymorphisms in DNA repair genes have demonstrated a significant association with cancer risk. Our study attempts to give a glimpse of the overall scenario of the germline polymorphisms in the DNA repair genes by taking into account of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database as well as the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) for evaluating the disease link, particularly in cancer. It has been found that ExAC DNA repair dataset (which consists of 228 DNA repair genes) comprises 30.4% missense, 12.5% dbSNP reported and 3.2% ClinVar significant variants. 27% of all the missense variants has the deleterious SIFT score of 0.00 and 6% variants carrying the most damaging Polyphen-2 score of 1.00, thus affecting the protein structure and function. However, as per HGMD, only a fraction (1.2%) of ExAC DNA repair variants was found to be cancer-related, indicating remaining variants reported in both the databases to be further analyzed. This, in turn, may provide an increased spectrum of the reported cancer linked variants in the DNA repair genes present in ExAC database. Moreover, further in silico functional assay of the identified vital cancer-associated variants, which is essential to get their actual biological significance, may shed some lights in the field of targeted drug development in near future.",

        "Title": "Determinants of Divergent Adaptive Immune Responses after Airway Sensitization with Ligands of Toll-Like Receptor 5 or Toll-Like Receptor 9.",
        "Abstract": "Excessive type 2 helper T cell responses to environmental antigens can cause immunopathology such as asthma and allergy, but how such immune responses are induced remains unclear. We studied this process in the airways by immunizing mice intranasally with the antigen ovalbumin together with either of two Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. We found the TLR5 ligand flagellin promoted a type 2 helper T cell response, whereas, a TLR9 ligand CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ODN) promoted a type 1 helper T cell response. CpG ODN induced mRNA encoding interleukin (IL)-12 p40, whereas, flagellin caused IL-33 secretion and induced mRNAs encoding IL-1 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). By using mice deficient in the TLR and IL-1R signaling molecule, myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), in conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and alveolar macrophages (AMs), and by cell sorting different lung populations after 2 hours of in vivo stimulation, we characterized the cell types that rapidly produced inflammatory cytokines in response to TLR stimulation. CpG ODN was likely recognized by TLR9 on cDCs and AMs, which made mRNA encoding IL-12. IL-12 was necessary for the subsequent innate and adaptive interferon-\u03b3 production. In contrast, flagellin stimulated multiple cells of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic origin, including AMs, DCs, monocytes, and lung epithelial cells. AMs were largely responsible for IL-1\u03b1, whereas lung epithelial cells made TSLP. Multiple hematopoietic cells, including AMs, DCs, and monocytes contributed to other cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1. MyD88-dependent signals, likely through IL-1R and IL-33R, and MyD88-independent signals, likely from TSLP, were necessary in cDCs for promotion of the early IL-4 response by CD4 T cells in the draining lymph node. Thus, the cell types that responded to TLR ligands were a critical determinant of the innate cytokines produced and the character of the resulting adaptive immune response in the airways.",

        "Abstract": "LPS is a potent trigger of macrophage-mediated inflammation. However, prolonged exposure to LPS induces a state of tolerance that reprograms the inflammatory response, resulting in reduced inflammatory cytokine production in vitro and in vivo. Recent evidence suggests that LPS tolerance also increases the expression of a subset of genes that may protect animals from systemic infection while they are in the tolerized state. However, a molecular basis for these selective changes in inflammatory gene expression during LPS tolerance has remained elusive. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms that may account for these effects, focusing on changes in LPS signaling, epigenetic markers, and chromatin remodeling that may be responsible for cellular memory and physiologic changes that comprise the LPS tolerance phenomenon.",

        "Abstract": "Multiple genetic and environmental factors have been reported to play key role in the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here, we investigated interactions of XRCC1 Arg399Gln and XRCC2 Arg188His polymorphisms and environmental factors in modulating susceptibility to NPC in Northeast India. One-hundred NPC patients, 90 first-degree relatives of patients and 120 controls were enrolled in the study. XRCC1 Arg399Gln and XRCC2 Arg188His polymorphisms were determined using PCR-RFLP, and the results were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Logistic regression (LR) and multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) approaches were applied for statistical analysis. The XRCC1 Gln/Gln genotype showed increased risk (OR=2.76; <0.024) of NPC. However, individuals with both XRCC1 and XRCC2 polymorphic variants had 3.2 fold elevated risk (<0.041). An enhanced risk of NPC was also observed in smoked meat (OR=4.07; P=0.004) and fermented fish consumers (OR=4.34, P=0.001), and tobacco-betel quid chewers (OR=7.00; P=0.0001) carrying XRCC1 polymorphic variants. However, smokers carrying defective XRCC1 gene showed the highest risk (OR = 7.47; <0.0001). On MDR analysis, the best model for NPC risk was the five-factor model combination of XRCC1 variant genotype, fermented fish, smoked meat, smoking and chewing (CVC=10/10; TBA=0.636; <0.0001); whereas in interaction entropy graphs, smoked meat and tobacco chewing showed synergistic interactions with XRCC1. These findings suggest that interaction of genetic and environmental factors might increase susceptibility to NPC in Northeast Indian populations.",

        "Abstract": "Asymmetric cell division (ACD) in a perpendicular orientation promotes cell differentiation and organizes the stratified epithelium. However, the upstream cues regulating ACD have not been identified. Here, we report that phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) plays a critical role in establishing ACD in the epithelium. Production of phosphatidyl inositol triphosphate (PIP3) is localized to the apical side of basal cells. Asymmetric recruitment of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and partitioning defective (PAR) 3 is impaired in PDK1 conditional knockout (CKO) epidermis. PDK1(CKO) keratinocytes do not undergo calcium-induced activation of aPKC or IGF1-induced activation of AKT and fail to differentiate. PDK1(CKO) epidermis shows decreased expression of Notch, a downstream effector of ACD, and restoration of Notch rescues defective expression of differentiation-induced Notch targets in\u00a0vitro. We\u00a0therefore propose that PDK1 signaling regulates\u00a0the basal-to-suprabasal switch in developing epidermis by acting as both an activator and organizer of ACD and the Notch-dependent differentiation program.",

In this study, mouse intramammary infection model was used to uncover the host immune response to two epidemiologically important live strains of S. uberis (SU1and SU2) obtained from subclinical case of mastitis possessing specific and unique multi locus sequence types (ST), pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pulsotypes and virulence profiles. Temporal (2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h and 48h) expression of key inflammatory mediators (IL2, IL4, IL6, IL12, TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, GMCSF, TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, TLR11, TLR12, CD14, IL1\u03b2, RANTES, Lactoferrin, and CXCl1) by reverse transcription and probe-based quantitative real-time PCR showed relative mRNA levels higher (p<0.05) in response to SU2 compared with SU1 with 24h PI serving as a critical point for the deviating behavior (SU1 versus SU2). Further employing the predicted biological processes under the influence of this pool of tested genes, the delineation of gene regulatory networks suggested SU1-favoring its persistence in the host environment; in contrast, SU2-which elevated gene expression indicating towards pathogen clearance or immune surveillance. This study suggested how these unique strains could manipulate the host immune response to influence the severity of mastitis; our results expand the available information on host pathogen interaction and provide a firm foundation needing further investigations to gain control over this pathogen.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have implicated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as regulators of many important biological processes. Here we report on the identification and characterization of a lncRNA, lnc13, that harbors a celiac disease-associated haplotype block and represses expression of certain inflammatory genes under homeostatic conditions. Lnc13 regulates gene expression by binding to hnRNPD, a member of a family of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). Upon stimulation, lnc13 levels are reduced, thereby allowing increased expression of the repressed genes. Lnc13 levels are significantly decreased in small intestinal biopsy samples from patients with celiac disease, which suggests that down-regulation of lnc13 may contribute to the inflammation seen in this disease. Furthermore, the lnc13 disease-associated variant binds hnRNPD less efficiently than its wild-type counterpart, thus helping to explain how these single-nucleotide polymorphisms contribute to celiac disease.",

        "Title": "Association between OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and risk of upper aero-digestive tract and gastrointestinal cancers: a meta-analysis.",
        "Abstract": "Cancers of the upper aero-digestive and gastrointestinal tract are one of the major causes of mortality around the world. DNA repair genes play a vital role in preventing carcinogenesis by maintaining genomic integrity. Polymorphisms in the nucleotide sequence of DNA repair genes are often reported to be associated with an increased risk for different cancers. The OGG1 gene encodes the enzyme 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase which removes oxidatively damaged bases of DNA. Several studies report that the OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism increases the risk for cancers of the upper aero-digestive and gastrointestinal tract. However, other studies provide evidence that such an association does not exist. A meta-analysis to assess the role of OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism in the cancers of the upper aero-digestive and gastrointestinal tract was therefore undertaken in order to resolve this ambiguity. Seventeen studies were recruited for this meta-analysis after screening 58 articles with a total of 5533 cases and 6834 controls for which the odds ratio with 95\u00a0% confidence interval was calculated. Begg's funnel test and Egger's test were performed for calculating publication bias. Our study reveals an association between OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and cancer susceptibility of the upper aero-digestive and gastrointestinal tract (CG\u00a0+\u00a0GG vs CC; odds ratio, OR 1.22; 95\u00a0% CI 1.05-1.41; GG vs CG\u00a0+\u00a0CC; OR 1.36; 95\u00a0% CI 1.09-1.70; GG vs CC; OR 1.46; 95\u00a0% CI 1.12-1.92). Subgroup analysis based on cancer types and ethnicity also revealed the association of OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism to the risk for upper aero-digestive and gastrointestinal tract cancers among both the Asian and the Caucasian populations. No risk was however observed for smoking habits and OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism. In conclusion, OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism may be associated with the increased risk for aero-digestive tract and gastro-intestinal cancers in both Asian and Caucasian populations.",

        "Abstract": "More than two third area of our planet is covered by oceans and assessment of marine biodiversity is a challenging task. With the increasing global population, there is a tendency to exploit marine resources for food, energy and other requirements. This puts pressure on the fragile marine environment and necessitates sustainable conservation efforts. Marine species identification using traditional taxonomical methods is often burdened with taxonomic controversies. Here we discuss the comparatively new concept of DNA barcoding and its significance in marine perspective. This molecular technique can be useful in the assessment of cryptic species which is widespread in marine environment and linking the different life cycle stages to the adult which is difficult to accomplish in the marine ecosystem. Other advantages of DNA barcoding include authentication and safety assessment of seafood, wildlife forensics, conservation genetics and detection of invasive alien species (IAS). Global DNA barcoding efforts in the marine habitat include MarBOL, CeDAMar, CMarZ, SHARK-BOL, etc. An overview on DNA barcoding of different marine groups ranging from the microbes to mammals is revealed. In conjugation with newer and faster techniques like high-throughput sequencing, DNA barcoding can serve as an effective modern tool in marine biodiversity assessment and conservation.",

TLR11 has been shown to interact with two known protein PAMPs: Salmonella and E. coli flagellin FliC and Toxoplasma gondii profilin-like protein. Given the highly divergent biology of these pathogens recognized by TLR11, it is unclear whether common mechanisms are used to recognize these distinct protein PAMPs. Here we show that TLR11 interacts with these two PAMPs using different receptor domains. Furthermore, TLR11 binding to flagellin and profilin exhibits differential dependency on pH and receptor ectodomain cleavage.",

        "Abstract": "Methanogens, a key contributor in global carbon cycling, methane emission, and alternative energy production, generate methane gas via anaerobic digestion of organic matter. The methane emission potential depends upon methanogenic diversity and activity. Since they are anaerobes and difficult to isolate and culture, their diversity present in the landfill sites of Delhi and marshlands of Southern Assam, India, was analyzed using molecular techniques like 16S rDNA sequencing, DGGE, and qPCR. The sequencing results indicated the presence of methanogens belonging to the seventh order and also the order Methanomicrobiales in the Ghazipur and Bhalsawa landfill sites of Delhi. Sequences, related to the phyla Crenarchaeota (thermophilic) and Thaumarchaeota (mesophilic), were detected from marshland sites of Southern Assam, India. Jaccard analysis of DGGE gel using Gel2K showed three main clusters depending on the number and similarity of band patterns. The copy number analysis of hydrogenotrophic methanogens using qPCR indicates higher abundance in landfill sites of Delhi as compared to the marshlands of Southern Assam. The knowledge about \"methanogenic archaea composition\" and \"abundance\" in the contrasting ecosystems like \"landfill\" and \"marshland\" may reorient our understanding of the Archaea inhabitants. This study could shed light on the relationship between methane-dynamics and the global warming process.",

        "Abstract": "A number of different epidemiological studies have measured the association between the risk of different cancers and polymorphism at promoter region of 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. However the results were contentious rather than conclusive. The current study was aimed at evaluating the association between the SNP (rs189037 G>A) and the risk of head and neck cancer and lung cancer by conducting a meta-analysis. A total of 9 case-control studies were considered for this quantitative analysis. Stats Direct Statistical software (version 2.7.2) was used to evaluate the crude odds ratio (OR) with their 95% confidence interval (CI). The dominant model (GG vs. GA\u00a0+\u00a0AA) showed no heterogeneity and the fixed effects pooled OR was found to be significant (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.14, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.05-1.25) at p\u00a0=\u00a00.003. The pooled OR for fixed effects of heterozygote and homozygote mutant allele (GA vs. AA) model was significant (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.17, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.04-1.30, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and no heterogeneity was observed for this model. The current meta-analysis manifested that ATM rs189037 G>A genetic polymorphism may contribute increased risk of head and neck and lung cancer. Moreover, the AA mutant allele was found to be related significantly with the prognosis of lung cancer and head and neck cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Despite intense investigations, no effective therapy is available to halt its progression. We found that NF-\u03baB was activated within the hippocampus and cortex of AD subjects and that activated forms of NF-\u03baB negatively correlated with cognitive function monitored by Mini-Mental State Examination and global cognitive z score. Accordingly, NF-\u03baB activation was also observed in the hippocampus of a transgenic (5XFAD) mouse model of AD. It has been shown that peptides corresponding to the NF-\u03baB essential modifier (NEMO)-binding domain (NBD) of I\u03baB kinase \u03b1 (IKK\u03b1) or I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 (IKK\u03b2) specifically inhibit the induction of NF-\u03baB activation without inhibiting the basal NF-\u03baB activity. Interestingly, after intranasal administration, wild-type NBD peptide entered into the hippocampus, reduced hippocampal activation of NF-\u03baB, suppressed hippocampal microglial activation, lowered the burden of A\u03b2 in the hippocampus, attenuated apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, protected plasticity-related molecules, and improved memory and learning in 5XFAD mice. Mutated NBD peptide had no such protective effect, indicating the specificity of our finding. These results suggest that selective targeting of NF-\u03baB activation by intranasal administration of NBD peptide may be of therapeutic benefit for AD patients.",

While tumor initiation is typically independent of inflammatory events, immune cells infiltrating the tumor microenvironment secrete inflammatory cytokines that enhance the aberrant growth of tumor cells and thus facilitate tumor progression. Therefore, inflammation and tumor growth are usually interpreted as closely related on a systemic level but as distinct, independently regulated processes at a molecular level.",

        "Title": "CHMP5 controls bone turnover rates by dampening NF-\u03baB activity in osteoclasts.",
        "Abstract": "Physiological bone remodeling requires that bone formation by osteoblasts be tightly coupled to bone resorption by osteoclasts. However, relatively little is understood about how this coupling is regulated. Here, we demonstrate that modulation of NF-\u03baB signaling in osteoclasts via a novel activity of charged multivesicular body protein 5 (CHMP5) is a key determinant of systemic rates of bone turnover. A conditional deletion of CHMP5 in osteoclasts leads to increased bone resorption by osteoclasts coupled with exuberant bone formation by osteoblasts, resembling an early onset, polyostotic form of human Paget's disease of bone (PDB). These phenotypes are reversed by haploinsufficiency for Rank, as well as by antiresorptive treatments, including alendronate, zolendronate, and OPG-Fc. Accordingly, CHMP5-deficient osteoclasts display increased RANKL-induced NF-\u03baB activation and osteoclast differentiation. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that CHMP5 cooperates with the PDB genetic risk factor valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) to stabilize the inhibitor of NF-\u03baB\u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1), down-regulating ubiquitination of I\u03baB\u03b1 via the deubiquitinating enzyme USP15. Thus, CHMP5 tunes NF-\u03baB signaling downstream of RANK in osteoclasts to dampen osteoclast differentiation, osteoblast coupling and bone turnover rates, and disruption of CHMP5 activity results in a PDB-like skeletal disorder.",

        "Abstract": "Suppression of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation, which is best known as a major regulator of innate and adaptive immune responses, is a potent strategy for the treatment of endotoxic sepsis. To inhibit NF-\u03baB functions, we designed the intra-nuclear transducible form of transcription modulation domain (TMD) of RelA (p65), called nt-p65-TMD, which can be delivered effectively into the nucleus without influencing the cell viability, and work as interactomic inhibitors via disruption of the endogenous p65-mediated transcription complex. nt-p65-TMD effectively inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, or IL-6 from BV2 microglia cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). nt-p65-TMD did not inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling mediators such as ZAP-70, p38, JNK, or ERK involved in T cell activation, but was capable of suppressing the transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB without the functional effect on that of NFAT upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. The transduced nt-p65-TMD in T cell did not affect the expression of CD69, however significantly inhibited the secretion of T cell-specific cytokines such as IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-17A, or IL-10. Systemic administration of nt-p65-TMD showed a significant therapeutic effect on LPS-induced sepsis model by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion. Therefore, nt-p65-TMD can be a novel therapeutics for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases, including sepsis, where a transcription factor has a key role in pathogenesis, and further allows us to discover new functions of p65 under normal physiological condition without genetic alteration.",

        "Abstract": "Intestinal diarrheagenic polyparasitic infections are among the major public health concerns in developing countries. Here we examined stool specimens by microscopy, DNA dot blot and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to evaluate the co-infection of four principal protozoans among amoebic dysentery cases from Northeast Indian population. The multiplex PCR confirmed Entamoeba histolytica (8.1%), Entamoeba dispar (4.8%) and mixed infection of both the parasites (3.4%) in 68 of 356 stool specimens that were positive in microscopy and/or HMe probe based DNA dot blot screening. The prevailing parasite that co-exists with E. histolytica was Giardia duodenalis (34.1%), followed by Enterocytozoon bieneusi (22.0%), Cryptosporidium parvum (14.6%) and Cyclospora cayetanensis (7.3%, P = 0.017). Symptomatic participants (odds ratio (OR) = 4.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06, 15.68; P = 0.041), monsoon season (OR = 7.47; 95% CI = 1.40, 39.84; P = 0.046) and participants with family history of parasitic infection (OR = 4.50; 95% CI = 1.16, 17.51; P = 0.030) have significant association with overall co-infection rate. According to molecular consensus, comprehensive microscopy yielded 3.4% (12/356) false-negative and 7.6% (27/356) false-positive outcome, suggesting an improved broad-spectrum PCR-based diagnostic is required to scale down the poor sensitivity and specificity as well as implementation of integrated control strategy.",

        "Abstract": "Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) is a key signaling molecule downstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and is a master regulator of multiple kinases in cells of epithelial and hematopoietic lineages. The physiological role of PDK1 in regulating skin and immune homeostasis is not known. Here we developed a mouse model in which PDK1 is conditionally ablated in activated CD4 T cells, regulatory T cells, and mature keratinocytes through OX40-Cre recombinase expression. The resultant mice (PDK1-CKO) spontaneously developed severe dermatitis, skin fibrosis, and systemic T helper type 2 immunity, succumbing by 11 weeks of age. Through a series of T-cell transfers, bone marrow reconstitutions, and crossing to lymphocyte-deficient backgrounds, we demonstrate that ablation of PDK1 in keratinocytes is the major driver of disease pathogenesis. PDK1-deficient keratinocytes exhibit intrinsic defects in the expression of key structural proteins including cytokeratin-10 and loricrin, resulting in increased keratinocyte turnover, which in turn triggers inflammation, T-cell recruitment, and immune-mediated destruction. Our results reveal PDK1 as a central regulator of keratinocyte homeostasis that prevents skin immune infiltration and inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "In the present study, we investigated the effect of the DNA repair gene polymorphisms XPD Asp312Asn (G>A), APE1 Asp148Glu (T>G), and MUTYH Tyr165Cys (G>A) on the risk for head and neck cancer (HNC) in association with tobacco use in a population of Northeast India. The study subjects comprised of 80 HNC patients and 92 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using amplification refractory mutation system-PCR (ARMS-PCR) for XPD Asp312Asn (G>A) and PCR using confronting two-pair primers (PCR-CTPP) for APE1 Asp148Glu (T>G) and MUTYH Tyr165Cys (G>A). The XPD Asp/Asn genotype increased the risk for HNC by 2-fold (odds ratio, OR\u2009=\u20092.072; 95 % CI, 1.025-4.190; p\u2009<\u20090.05). Interaction between APE1 Asp/Asp and XPD Asp/Asn as well as MUTYH Tyr/Tyr and XPD Asp/Asn genotypes further increased the risk by 2.9 (OR\u2009=\u20092.97; 95 % CI, 1.16-7.61; p\u2009<\u20090.05) and 2.3 (OR\u2009=\u20092.37; 95 % CI, 1.11-5.10; p\u2009<\u20090.05) folds, respectively. The risk was further increased in heavy smokers with the XPD Asp/Asn genotype and heavy tobacco chewers with XPD Asn/Asn genotype by 7.7-fold (OR\u2009=\u20097.749; 95 % CI, 2.53-23.70; p\u2009<\u20090.05) and 10-fold (OR\u2009=\u200910; 95 % CI, 1.26-79.13; p\u2009<\u20090.05), respectively. We thus conclude that the XPD Asp312Asn and APE1 Asp148Glu polymorphisms increase the risk for HNC in association with smoking and/or tobacco chewing in the population under study.",

        "Abstract": "Genetic polymorphisms in tobacco-metabolizing genes may modulate the risk of head and neck cancer (HNC). In Northeast India, head and neck cancers and tobacco consumption remains most prevalent. The aim of the study was to investigate the combined effect of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) T3801C, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) genes polymorphisms and smoking and tobacco-betel quid chewing in the risk of HNC. The study included 420 subjects (180 cases and 240 controls) from Northeast Indian population. Polymorphisms of CYP1A1 T3801C and GST (M1 & T1) were studied by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and multiplex PCR, respectively. Logistic regression (LR) and multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) approach were applied for statistical analysis. LR analysis revealed that subjects carrying CYP1A1 TC/CC\u2009+\u2009GSTM1 null genotypes had 3.52-fold (P\u2009<\u20090.001) increase the risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Smokers carrying CYP1A1 TC/CC\u2009+\u2009GSTM1 null and CYP1A1 TC/CC\u2009+\u2009GSTT1 null genotypes showed significant association with HNC risk (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20096.42; P\u2009<\u20090.001 and 3.86; P\u2009=\u20090.005, respectively). Similarly, tobacco-betel quid chewers carrying CYP1A1 TC/CC\u2009+\u2009GSTM1 null genotypes also had several fold increased risk of HNC (P\u2009<\u20090.001). In MDR analysis, the best model for HNSCC risk was the four-factor model of tobacco-betel quid chewing, smoking, CYP1A1 TC/CC, and GSTM1 null genotypes (testing balance accuracy [TBA]\u2009=\u20090.6292; cross-validation consistency [CVC]\u2009=\u20099/10 and P\u2009<\u20090.0001). These findings suggest that interaction of combined genotypes of carcinogen-metabolizing genes with environmental factors might modulate susceptibility of HNC in Northeast Indian population.",

        "Abstract": "Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease in which activated immune cells and the proinflammatory cytokine TNF are well-known mediators of pathogenesis. The transcription factor NF-\u03baB is a key regulator of TNF production and TNF-induced proinflammatory gene expression, and both the psoriatic transcriptome and genetic susceptibility further implicate NF-\u03baB in psoriasis etiopathology. However, the role of NF-\u03baB in psoriasis remains controversial. We analyzed the function of canonical NF-\u03baB in the epidermis using CRE-mediated deletion of p65 and c-Rel in keratinocytes. In contrast to animals lacking p65 or c-Rel alone, mice lacking both subunits developed severe dermatitis after birth. Consistent with its partial histological similarity to human psoriasis, this condition could be prevented by anti-TNF treatment. Moreover, regulatory T cells in lesional skin played an important role in disease remission. Our results demonstrate that canonical NF-\u03baB in keratinocytes is essential for the maintenance of skin immune homeostasis and is protective against spontaneous dermatitis.",

        "Abstract": "Several studies from developing countries have shown human papillomavirus to be associated with colorectal cancers, but the molecular characteristics of such cancers are poorly known. We studied the various genetic variations like microsatellite instability (MSI), oncogenic mutations and epigenetic deregulations like CpG island methylation in HPV associated and nonassociated colorectal cancer patients from Indian population. HPV DNA was detected by PCR using My09/My11 and Gp5+/Gp6+ consensus primers and typed using HPV16 and HPV18 specific primers. MSI was detected using BAT 25 and BAT 26 markers, and mutation of KRAS, TP53 and BRAF V600E were detected by direct sequencing. Methyl specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was used to determine promoter methylation of the classical CIMP panel markers (P16, hMLH1, MINT1, MINT2 and MINT31) and other tumour-related genes (DAPK, RASSF1, BRCA1 and GSTP1). HPV DNA was detected in 34/93 (36.5 %) colorectal tumour tissues, HPV 18 being the predominant high-risk type. MSI was detected in 7.5 % cases; KRAS codon 12, 13, BRAF V600E and TP53 mutations were detected in 36.5, 3.2 and 37.6 % of the cases, respectively. CIMP-high was observed in 44.08 % cases. HPV presence was not associated with age, stage or grade of tumours, MSI or mutations in KRAS, TP53 or BRAF genes. Higher methylation frequencies of all genes/loci under study except RASSF1, as well as significantly higher CIMP-high characteristics were observed in HPV positive tumours as compared to negative cases. HPV in association with genetic and epigenetic features might be a potent risk factor for colorectal cancer in Indian population.",

        "Title": "Trend of different molecular markers in the last decades for studying human migrations.",
        "Abstract": "Anatomically modern humans are known to have widely migrated throughout history. Different scientific evidences suggest that the entire human population descended from just several thousand African migrants. About 85,000 years ago, the first wave of human migration was out of Africa, that followed the coasts through the Middle East, into Southern Asia via Sri Lanka, and in due course around Indonesia and into Australia. Another wave of migration between 40,000 and 12,000 years ago brought humans northward into Europe. However, the frozen north limited human expansion in Europe, and created a land bridge, \"Bering land bridge\", connecting Asia with North America about 25,000 years ago. Although fossil data give the most direct information about our past, it has certain anomalies. So, molecular archeologists are now using different molecular markers to trace the \"most recent common ancestor\" and also the migration pattern of modern humans. In this study, we have studied the trend of molecular markers and also the methodologies implemented in the last decades (2003-2014). From our observation, we can say that D-loop region of mtDNA and Y chromosome based markers are predominant. Nevertheless, mtDNA, especially the D-loop region, has some unique features, which makes it a more effective marker for tracing prehistoric footprints of modern human populations. Although, natural selection should also be taken into account in studying mtDNA based human migration. As per technology is concerned, Sanger sequencing is the major technique that is being used in almost all studies. But, the emergence of different cost-effective-and-easy-to-handle NGS platforms has increased its popularity over Sanger sequencing in studying human migration.",

        "Title": "Genetic assessment of ornamental fish species from North East India.",
        "Abstract": "Ornamental fishes are traded with multiple names from various parts around the world, including North East India. Most are collected from the wild, due to lack of species-specific culture or breeding, and therefore, such unmanaged collection of the wild and endemic species could lead to severe threats to biodiversity. Despite many regulatory policies, trade of threatened species, including the IUCN listed species have been largely uncontrolled, due to species identification problems arising from the utilization of multiple trade names. So, the development of species-specific DNA marker is indispensable where DNA Barcoding is proved to be helpful in species identification. Here, we investigated, through DNA Barcoding and morphological assessment, the identification of 128 ornamental fish specimens exported from NE India from different exporters. The generated sequences were subjected to similarity match in BOLD-IDS as well as BLASTN, and analysed using MEGA5.2 for species identification through Neighbour-Joining (NJ) clustering, and K2P distance based approach. The analysis revealed straightforward identification of 84 specimens into 35 species, while 44 specimens were difficult to distinguish based on CO1 barcode alone. However, these cases were resolved through morphology, NJ and distanced based method and found to be belonging to 16 species. Among the 51 identified species, 14 species represented multiple trade names; 17 species belonged to threatened category. Species-level identification through DNA Barcoding along with traditional morphotaxonomy reflects its efficacy in regulating ornamental fish trade and therefore, appeals for their conservation in nature. The use of trade names rather than the zoological name created the passage for trafficking of the threatened species and demands immediate attention for sustaining wildlife conservation.",

        "Abstract": "Rectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease that develops through multiple pathways characterized by genetic and epigenetic alterations. India has a comparatively higher proportion of rectal cancers and early-onset cases. We analyzed genetic (KRAS, TP53 and BRAF mutations, and MSI), epigenetic alterations (CpG island methylation detection of 10 tumor-related genes/loci), the associated clinicopathological features and survival trend in 80 primary rectal cancer patients from India. MSI was detected using BAT 25 and BAT 26 mononucleotide markers and mutation of KRAS, TP53, and BRAF V600E was detected by direct sequencing. Methyl specific polymerase chain reaction was used to determine promoter methylation status of the classic CIMP panel markers (P16, hMLH1, MINT1, MINT2, and MINT31) as well as other tumor specific genes (DAPK, RASSF1, BRCA1, and GSTP1). MSI and BRAF mutations were uncommon but high frequencies of overall KRAS mutations (67.5%); low KRAS codon 12 and a novel KRAS G15S mutation with concomitant RASSF1 methylation in early onset cases were remarkable. Hierarchical clustering as well as principal component analysis identified three distinct subgroups of patients having discrete age at onset, clinicopathological, molecular and survival characteristics: (i) a KRAS associated CIMP-high subgroup; (ii) a significantly younger MSS, CIMP low, TP53 mutant group having differential KRAS mutation patterns, and (iii) a CIMP-negative, TP53 mutated group. The early onset subgroup exhibited the most unfavorable disease characteristics with advanced stage, poorly differentiated tumors and had the poorest survival compared to the other subgroups. Genetic and epigenetic profiling of rectal cancer patients identified distinct subtypes in Indian population.",

        "Abstract": "The transformation of cells generally involves multiple genetic lesions that undermine control of both cell death and proliferation. We now report that \u03baB-Ras proteins act as regulators of NF-\u03baB and Ral pathways, which control inflammation/cell death and proliferation, respectively. Cells lacking \u03baB-Ras therefore not only show increased NF-\u03baB activity, which results in increased expression of inflammatory mediators, but also exhibit elevated Ral activity, which leads to enhanced anchorage-independent proliferation (AIP). \u03baB-Ras deficiency consequently leads to significantly increased tumor growth that can be dampened by inhibiting either Ral or NF-\u03baB pathways, revealing the unique tumor-suppressive potential of \u03baB-Ras proteins. Remarkably, numerous human tumors show reduced levels of \u03baB-Ras, and increasing the level of \u03baB-Ras in these tumor cells impairs their ability to undergo AIP, thereby implicating \u03baB-Ras proteins in human disease.",

        "Abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been recently associated with squamous cell carcinoma of upper aerodigestive tract (SCC of UADT), but its possible role in promoting aberrant methylation in these tumors has largely remained unexplored. Herein, we investigated the association of HPV with aberrant methylation in tumor-related genes/loci consisting of the classical CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) panel markers (p16, MLH1, MINT1, MINT2, and MINT31) and other frequently methylated cancer-related genes (DAPK1, GSTP1, BRCA1, ECAD, and RASSF1) and survival of UDAT cancers. The study includes 219 SCC of UADT patients from different hospitals of Northeast India. Detection of HPV and aberrant promoter methylation was performed by PCR and Methylation Specific PCR respectively. Association study was conducted by Logistic regression analysis and overall survival analysis was done by Kaplan-Meier plot. HPV was detected in 37% of cases, with HPV-18 as the major high-risk sub-type. Although HPV presence did not seem to affect survival in overall UADT cancers, but was associated with a favourable prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Hierarchical clustering revealed three distinct clusters with different methylation profile and HPV presence. Among these, the CIMP-high subgroup exhibited the highest HPV positive cases (66%). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed a strong synergistic association of HPV and tobacco towards modulating promoter hypermethylation in UADT cancer (OR\u2009=\u200927.50 [95% CI\u2009=\u200911.51-88.03] for CIMP-high vs. CIMP-low). The present study proposes a potential role of HPV in impelling aberrant methylation in specific tumor related loci, which might contribute in the initiation and progression of SCC of UADT.",

        "Abstract": "There is renewed interest towards understanding the host-pathogen interaction in the light of epigenetic modifications. Although epithelial tissue is the major site for host-pathogen interactions, there is handful of studies to show how epithelial cells respond to pathogens. Bacterial infection in the mammary gland parenchyma induces local and subsequently systemic inflammation that results in a complex disease called mastitis. Globally Staphylococcus aureus is the single largest mastitis pathogen and the infection can ultimately result in either subclinical or chronic and sometimes lifelong infection.",

        "Abstract": "The Consortium of Barcode of Life plant working group proposed to use the defined portion of plastid genes rbcL and matK either singly or in combination as the standard DNA barcode for plants. But DNA barcode based identification of biologically complex plant groups are always a challenging task due to the occurrence of natural hybridization. Here, we examined the use of indels polymorphism in trnH-psbA and trnL-trnF sequences for rapid species identification of citrus. DNA from young leaves of selected citrus species were isolated and matK gene (~800\u00a0bp) and trnH-psbA spacer (~450\u00a0bp) of Chloroplast DNA was amplified for species level identification. The sequences within the group taxa of Citrus were aligned using the ClustalX program. With few obvious misalignments were corrected manually using the similarity criterion. We identified a 54\u00a0bp inverted repeat or palindrome sequence (27-80 regions) and 6 multi residues indel coding regions. Large inverted repeats in cpDNA provided authentication at the higher taxonomic levels. These diagnostics indel marker from trnH-psbA were successful in identifying different species (5 out of 7) within the studied Citrus except Citrus limon and Citrus medica. These two closely related species are distinguished through the 6\u00a0bp deletion in trnL-trnF. This study demonstrated that the indel polymorphism based approach easily characterizes the Citrus species and the same may be applied in other complex groups. Likewise other indels occurring intergenic spacer of chloroplast regions may be tested for rapid identification of other secondary citrus species.",

        "Abstract": "The NF-\u03baB family of inducible transcription factors is activated in response to a variety of stimuli. Amongst the best-characterized inducers of NF-\u03baB are members of the TNF family of cytokines. Research on NF-\u03baB and TNF have been tightly intertwined for more than 25 years. Perhaps the most compelling examples of the interconnectedness of NF-\u03baB and the TNF have come from analysis of knock-out mice that are unable to activate NF-\u03baB. Such mice die embryonically, however, deletion of TNF or TNFR1 can rescue the lethality thereby illustrating the important role of NF-\u03baB as the key regulator of transcriptional responses to TNF. The physiological connections between NF-\u03baB and TNF cytokines are numerous and best explored in articles focusing on a single TNF family member. Instead, in this review, we explore general mechanisms of TNF cytokine signaling, with a focus on the upstream signaling events leading to activation of the so-called canonical and noncanonical NF-\u03baB pathways by TNFR1 and CD40, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Tobacco consumption in various forms is one of the major risk factor for the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Polymorphisms in XRCC1 and XRCC2 genes may alter an individual's susceptibility to tobacco-related cancers. Here, we have investigated the interaction of XRCC1 (Arg399Gln) and XRCC2 (Arg188His) polymorphism and tobacco exposure in the progression of HNSCC in northeast Indian population. The population-based case-control study includes 110 HNSCC patients and 140 controls. The polymorphisms of XRCC1 and XRCC2 were studied by means of PCR-RFLP, and the results were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Smokers and tobacco-betel quid chewers were significantly higher in cases (P = 0.045 and 0.033). The variant homozygote AA genotype of XRCC1 Arg399Gln and heterozygote GA genotype of XRCC2 Arg188His has an increased risk toward HNSCC (OR 2.43; P = 0.031 and OR 3.29; P < 0.01, respectively). The interaction between tobacco-betel quid chewing and variant genotypes of XRCC1 and XRCC2 resulted in several fold increase the risk of HNSCC, when compared to non-chewers. Heavy smokers carrying XRCC1 AA and XRCC2 GA genotypes had a significantly higher risk of HNSCC compared to never smokers (P = 0.017 and 0.003, respectively). Upon gene-gene interaction analysis, individuals carrying both XRCC1 GA (Arg/Gln) and XRCC2 GA (Arg/His) genotypes had the highest risk of HNSCC (P = 0.001).Our finding suggests that interaction of tobacco and polymorphisms of XRCC1 and XRCC2 increases the risk of HNSCC. Furthermore, cross talk between these two DNA repair genes might modulate susceptibility toward HNSCC.",

        "Abstract": "A20 has been suggested to limit NF-\u03baB activation by removing regulatory ubiquitin chains from ubiquitinated substrates. A20 is a ubiquitin-editing enzyme that removes K63-linked ubiquitin chains from adaptor proteins, such as RIP1, and then conjugates them to K48-linked polyubiquitin chains to trigger proteasomal degradation. To determine the role of the deubiquitinase function of A20 in downregulating NF-\u03baB signaling, we have generated a knock-in mouse that lacks the deubiquitinase function of A20 (A20-OTU mice). These mice are normal and have no signs of inflammation, have normal proportions of B, T, dendritic, and myeloid cells, respond normally to LPS and TNF, and undergo normal NF-\u03baB activation. Our results thus indicate that the deubiquitinase activity of A20 is dispensable for normal NF-\u03baB signaling.",

Widely accepted biochemical panels for HNSCC detection is not available yet. We tried to find out the effectiveness of the serum-based biochemical markers for their prognostic significance in HNSCC. We collected fresh blood samples of 80 HNSCC patients and 100 healthy subjects. Samples were analyzed for absolute levels of arginase (ARG), ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), catalase (CAT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), amylase (AMY) activity, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Receiver-operator characteristic curves and Fagan's nomograms were generated. Out of six parameters studied, four (OAT, CAT, LDH, and AMY) did not show biologically significant differences to be used as biomarkers. Significant elevation in serum ARG and CRP levels were observed in HNSCC. The individual estimation of ARG and CRP showed lower specificity, but their combination improved the specificity level to 95%. Our results suggest that serum ARG and CRP together can efficiently diagnose HNSCC.",

        "Title": "Dysfunction of mitochondria due to environmental carcinogens in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the ethnic group of Northeast Indian population.",
        "Abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare cancer worldwide, but in India, NPC is uncommon in its subcontinent except in the north-eastern part of the country. NPC is thought to be caused by the combined effects of environmental carcinogens, genetic susceptibility and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This is the first study that aimed to examine the selected risk factors, mostly dietary, viral environmental, metabolic gene polymorphisms, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number variation and their risk, in subjects who are highly prone to NPC in the ethnic groups of Northeast India, which has included cases, first-degree relatives and controls. The cases and controls were selected from three ethnic groups (Manipuri, Naga and Mizo) of Northeast India with high prevalence of NPC. This case-control family study includes 64 NPC patients, 88 first-degree relatives and 100 controls having no history of cancer. PCR-based detection was done for EBV-latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) gene and glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 (GSTM1)-glutathione S-transferase theta 1 (GSTT1) polymorphism. A comparative \u0394Ct method was used for the determination of mtDNA content. An increased risk of 2.00-6.06-folds to NPC was observed with those who intake smoked meat and fish, salted fish and fermented fish; betel nut chewers; tobacco smokers; alcohol drinkers; and those who have kitchen inside the living room, glutathione S-transferase null genotype and EBV infection. The risk of NPC increased in cases with decreased mtDNA copy number (P trend = 0.007). A significant difference between GST null genotypes and EBV infection with mtDNA content was found in the cases (P < 0.0001). The understandings of environment-genetic risk factors and their role in the etiology of NPC are helpful as preventive measures and screening.",

        "Abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) is a highly inducible cytokine receptor that engages multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Fn14 expression is regulated by several cytokines and growth factors, and Fn14 is transiently up-regulated after injury. In contrast, in states of chronic inflammatory disease and in some solid tumors, Fn14 is persistently up-regulated. However, the post-translational regulation of Fn14 expression has not been directly investigated. Thus, we examined Fn14 proteostasis in the presence and absence of the Fn14 ligand TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK). Similar to other TNF receptor superfamily members, we found that TWEAK induces Fn14 internalization and degradation. Surprisingly, we also observed rapid, TWEAK-independent, constitutive Fn14 internalization and turnover. Fn14 levels are maintained in cell culture by ongoing synthesis and trafficking of the receptor, leading to subsequent down-regulation by lysosomal degradation. Unexpectedly, the extracellular domain of Fn14 is necessary and sufficient for constitutive turnover. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which constitutive down-regulation of Fn14 facilitates dynamic regulation of Fn14 protein levels and prevents spontaneous or inappropriate receptor signaling.",

        "Abstract": "The NF-\u03baB family of transcription factors plays a central role in the inducible expression of inflammatory genes during the immune response, and the proper regulation of these genes is a critical factor in the maintenance of immune homeostasis. The chromatin environment at stimulus-responsive NF-\u03baB sites is a major determinant in transcription factor binding, and dynamic alteration of the chromatin state to facilitate transcription factor binding is a key regulatory mechanism. NF-\u03baB is in turn able to influence the chromatin state through a variety of mechanisms, including the recruitment of chromatin modifying co-activator complexes such as p300, the competitive eviction of negative chromatin modifications, and the recruitment of components of the general transcriptional machinery. Frequently, the selective interaction with these co-activators is dependent on specific post-translational modification of NF-\u03baB subunits. Finally, the mechanisms of inducible NF-\u03baB activity in different immune cell types seem to be largely conserved. The diversity of cell-specific NF-\u03baB-mediated transcriptional programs is established at the chromatin level during cell differentiation by lineage-defining transcription factors. These factors generate and maintain a cell-specific chromatin landscape that is accessible to NF-\u03baB, thus restricting the inducible transcriptional response to a cell-appropriate output.",

        "Abstract": "\u03b2-TrCP, the substrate recognition subunit of SCF-type ubiquitin ligases, is ubiquitously expressed from two distinct paralogs, targeting for degradation many regulatory proteins, among which is the NF-\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB. To appreciate tissue-specific roles of \u03b2-TrCP, we studied the consequences of inducible ablation of three or all four alleles of the E3 in the mouse gut. The ablation resulted in mucositis, a destructive gut mucosal inflammation, which is a common complication of different cancer therapies and represents a major obstacle to successful chemoradiation therapy. We identified epithelial-derived IL-1\u03b2 as the culprit of mucositis onset, inducing mucosal barrier breach. Surprisingly, epithelial IL-1\u03b2 is induced by DNA damage via an NF-\u03baB-independent mechanism. Tissue damage caused by gut barrier disruption is exacerbated in the absence of NF-\u03baB, with failure to express the endogenous IL-1\u03b2 receptor antagonist IL-1Ra upon four-allele loss. Antibody neutralization of IL-1\u03b2 prevents epithelial tight junction dysfunction and alleviates mucositis in \u03b2-TrCP-deficient mice. IL-1\u03b2 antagonists should thus be considered for prevention and treatment of severe morbidity associated with mucositis.",

Here we try to understand whether nucleotide and amino acid sequence in COI gene carry sufficient information to assign species to their higher taxonomic rank, using 160 species of Indian freshwater fishes. Our results reveal that with increase in the taxonomic rank, sequence conservation decreases for both nucleotides and amino acids. Order level exhibits lowest conservation with 50% of the nucleotides and amino acids being conserved. Among the variable sites, 30-50% were found to carry high information content within an order, while it was 70-80% within a family and 80-99% within a genus. High information content shows sites with almost conserved sequence but varying at one or two locations, which can be due to variations at species or population level. Thus, the potential of COI gene in higher taxon assignment is revealed with validation of ample inherent signals latent in the gene.",

        "Abstract": "Freshwater fishes in India are poorly known and plagued by many unresolved cryptic species complexes that masks some latent and endemic species. Limitations in traditional taxonomy have resulted in this crypticism. Hence, molecular approaches like DNA barcoding, are needed to diagnose these latent species. We have analyzed 1383 barcode sequences of 175 Indian freshwater fish species available in the databases, of which 172 sequences of 70 species were generated. The congeneric and conspecific genetic divergences were calculated using Kimura's 2 parameter distance model followed by the construction of a Neighbor Joining tree using the MEGA 5.1. DNA barcoding principle at its first hand approach, led to the straightforward identification of 82% of the studied species with 2.9% (S.E=0.2) divergence between the nearest congeners. However, after validating some cases of synonymy and mislabeled sequences, 5% more species were found to be valid. Sequences submitted to the database under different names were found to represent single species. On the other hand, some sequences of the species like Barilius barna, Barilius bendelisis and Labeo bata were submitted to the database under a single name but were found to represent either some unexplored species or latent species. Overall, 87% of the available Indian freshwater fish barcodes were diagnosed as true species in parity with the existing checklist and can act as reference barcode for the particular taxa. For the remaining 13% (21 species) the correct species name was difficult to assign as they depicted some erroneous identification and cryptic species complex. Thus, these barcodes will need further assay and inclusion of barcodes of more specimens from same and sister species.",

        "Title": "Design of mini-barcode for catfishes for assessment of archival biodiversity.",
        "Abstract": "Recovery of DNA barcode sequences is often challenging from the archived specimens. However, short fragments of DNA may be recovered, which would significantly improve many unresolved taxonomic conflicts. Here, we designed a mini-barcode for catfishes comprising several species and many cryptic taxa. We analysed a data set of 3048 publicly available COI barcode sequences representing 547 worldwide catfish species and performed 152 628 interspecies comparisons. A significantly more positively correlated interspecies distance was detected with transversion (0.78, P < 0.001) than with transition (0.70, P < 0.001). This suggested that transversions were better diagnostics for species identification. In the aligned data set, two transversion-rich fragments (53 bp and 119 bp) were identified. Transition/transversion bias value was 1.04 in 53-bp fragment, 1.23 in 119-bp fragment and 1.50 in full-length barcode. The interspecies distance with full-length barcode was 0.212 \u00b1 0.037, while that with 53-bp and 119-bp fragments was 0.325 \u00b1 0.039 and 0.218 \u00b1 0.045, respectively. Survey of 53-bp fragment showed a possibility of only 1144 barcodes, while that of 119-bp fragment showed >4 million barcodes. Thus, the 119-bp fragment is a viable mini-barcode for catfishes comprising >3000 extant species. Experiment with 82 archived catfishes showed successful recovery of this mini-barcode using the designed primer. The mini-barcode sequences showed species-specific similarity in the range of 98-100% with the global database. Therefore, survey of a transversion-rich fragment within the full-length barcode would be an ideal approach of mini-barcode design for biodiversity assessment.",

        "Abstract": "Manipuri pony is the geographically distant breed of horse from the five recognized horse breeds found in the Indian subcontinent. The phylogenetic relationship of Manipuri pony with the other breeds is unknown. The diversity in the mitochondrial (mt) DNA D-loop region is employed as an important tool to understand the origin and genetic diversification of domestic horses and to examine genetic relationships among breeds around the world. This study was carried out to understand the maternal lineages of Manipuri pony using the 247 bp region of the mtDNA D-loop. The dataset comprised of eleven numbers of self developed sequences of Manipuri pony, 59 and 35 number of retrieved sequences of Indian horse breeds and other worldwide breeds respectively. A total of 35 haplotypes was identified with a high level of genetic diversity in the Indian breeds. A total of seven major mtDNA haplogroups (A-G) was identified in the Indian horse breeds that indicated the abundance of mtDNA diversity and multiple origins of maternal lineages in them. The majority of the studied sequences of Indian breeds (33.3 %) were grouped into haplogroup D and least (3.9 %) in haplogroup E. The Manipuri breed showed the least FST distance (0.03866) with the most diverged Indian breeds and with Thoroughbred horse among the worldwide. This study indicated a close association between Manipuri pony and Thoroughbred.",

Epigenetic changes like, promoter hypermethylation of multiple tumour suppressor genes are frequent events in cancer, and certain habit-related carcinogens are thought to be capable of inducing aberrant methylation. However, the effects of environmental carcinogens depend upon the level of metabolism by carcinogen metabolizing enzymes. As such key interactions between habits related factors and carcinogen metabolizing gene polymorphisms towards modulating promoter methylation of genes are likely. However, this remains largely unexplored in ESCC. Here, we studied the interaction of various habits related factors and polymorphism of GSTM1/GSTT1 genes towards inducing promoter hypermethylation of multiple tumour suppressor genes.",

        "Title": "Transition from heterotypic to homotypic PDK1 homodimerization is essential for TCR-mediated NF-\u03baB activation.",
        "Abstract": "Strong NF-\u03baB activation requires ligation of both the CD28 coreceptor and TCR. Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) acts as a scaffold by binding both protein kinase C\u03b8 (PKC\u03b8) and CARMA1, and is therefore essential for signaling to NF-\u03baB. In this article, we demonstrate the importance of PDK1 Thr(513) phosphorylation in regulating the intermolecular organization of PDK1 homodimers. Thr(513) is directly involved in heterotypic PDK1 homodimer formation, in which binding is mediated through the pleckstrin homology (PH) and kinase domains. Upon activation, phosphorylated Thr(513) instead mediates homotypic intermolecular binding through the PH domains. Consequently, cell-permeable peptides with a Thr(513) to Ile derivative (protein transduction domain [PTD]-PDK1-Thr(513)-Ile) bound the kinase domain, whereas a Thr(513)-to-Asp peptide (PTD-PDK1-Thr(513)-Asp) bound the PH domain. PTD-PDK1-Thr(513)-Ile blocked binding between PDK1 and PKC\u03b8, phosphorylation of PKC\u03b8 Thr(538), and activation of both NF-\u03baB and AKT. In contrast, PTD-PDK1- Thr(513)-Asp selectively inhibited binding between PDK1 and CARMA1, and blocked TCR/CD28-induced NF-\u03baB activation. Therefore, Thr(513) phosphorylation regulates a critical intermolecular switch governing PDK1 homodimer structure and the capacity to interact with downstream signaling pathway components. Given the pleiotropic functions of PDK1, these data may open the door to the development of immunosuppressive therapies that selectively target the PDK1 to NF-\u03baB pathway in T cell activation.",

Tobacco consumption and HPV infection, both are the major risk factor for the development of oral cancer and causes mitochondrial dysfunction. Genetic polymorphisms in xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes modify the effect of environmental exposures, thereby playing a significant role in gene-environment interactions and hence contributing to the individual susceptibility to cancer. Here, we have investigated the association of tobacco - betel quid chewing, HPV infection, GSTM1-GSTT1 null genotypes, and tumour stages with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content variation in oral cancer patients.",

NF-\u03baB signaling is involved in both immune cell development and function, and it is critical in modulation of the immune response through the transcriptional regulation of cytokine and chemokine expression. An area of great interest in T-cell-mediated adaptive immunity is the ability of naive CD4(+) T cells generated in the thymus to differentiate into various subsets including T-helper 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17, Th9, follicular helper T (Tfh), Th22, and regulatory T (Treg) cells, upon encountering different pathogens and microenvironments. In this review, we discuss the role of NF-\u03baB pathway in the development and functional divergence of the different helper T-cell subsets as well as in regulatory T cells.",

        "Abstract": "Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) plays an important role in integrating the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and CD28 signals to achieve efficient NF-\u03baB activation. PDK1 is also an important regulator of T cell development, mediating pre-TCR induced proliferation signals. However, the role of PDK1 in B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling and B cell development remains largely unknown. In this study we provide genetic evidence supporting the role of PDK1 in B cell survival. We found PDK1 is required for BCR mediated survival in resting B cells, likely through regulation of Foxo activation. PDK1-dependent signaling to NF-\u03baB is not crucial to resting B cell viability. However, PDK1 is necessary for triggering NF-\u03baB during B cell activation and is required for activated B cell survival. Together these studies demonstrate that PDK1 is essential for BCR-induced signal transduction to Foxo and NF-\u03baB and is indispensable for both resting and activated B cell survival.",

We examined the complete mitochondrial genome to determine hot spot mutations in oral cancer. The complete mitochondrial genome was sequenced using PGM\u2122 from 10 patients matched blood and tumour tissue. Overall, 26 somatic mutations were found of which nine mutations in d-loop and 17 mutations in the coding region. The mutations at nucleotide positions 16294, 16325 and 16463 in d-loop and 4136, 13542 and 13869 in coding region are probably an indication to be a hot spot mutation in oral cancer. The knowledge about role, patterns and timing of mitochondrial mutations may serve to be facilitating clinical applications and hot spot mutations may be helpful in assessing cancer risk in tumour.",

Mutations of the Breast Cancer 1 (BRCA1) gene account for the majority of breast/ ovarian cancer families. The purpose of study was to provide a prevalence of BRCA1 germline mutations in the North-East Indian population. In relation to the personal and family history with the breast cancer, we found mutations in 6.25% and 12.5% respectively. Three mutations, 185DelAG, 1014DelGT and 3889DelAG, were observed in our North-East Indian patients in exons 2 and 11, resulting in truncation of the BRCA1 protein by forming stop codons individually at amino acid positions 39, 303 and 1265. Our results point to a necessity for an extensive mutation screening study of high risk breast cancer cases in our North-East Indian population, which will provide better decisive medical and surgical preventive options.",

        "Abstract": "\"Triple-defective\" (3d) mice carrying a mutation in UNC93B1, a chaperone for the endosomal nucleic acid-sensing (NAS) Toll-like receptors TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9, are highly susceptible to Toxoplasma gondii infection. However, none of the single or even the triple NAS-TLR-deficient animals recapitulated the 3d susceptible phenotype to experimental toxoplasmosis. Investigating this further, we found that while parasite RNA and DNA activate innate immune responses via TLR7 and TLR9, TLR11 and TLR12 working as heterodimers are required for sensing and responding to Toxoplasma profilin. Consequently, the triple TLR7/TLR9/TLR11-deficient mice are highly susceptible to T.\u00a0gondii infection, recapitulating the phenotype of 3d mice. Humans lack functional TLR11 and TLR12 genes. Consistently, human cells produce high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in response to parasite-derived RNA and DNA, but not to Toxoplasma profilin, supporting a more critical role for NAS-TLRs in human toxoplasmosis.",

        "Abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent inducer of inflammation. However, in a phenomenon known as LPS tolerance, prolonged exposure to LPS reprograms the host response to subsequent LPS reexposure. Proinflammatory cytokine production is suppressed, while production of antimicrobial genes is increased. In vivo models suggest that LPS tolerance dramatically reduces susceptibility to septic shock, while keeping the capacity for clearance of certain pathogens intact. These observations imply that artificial induction of tolerance may be an attractive means to intervene in the progression of sepsis and other inflammatory diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms that govern the tolerogenic response remain poorly understood, hindering efforts to evaluate LPS tolerance induction as a therapeutic approach. Recent advances indicate that chromatin modifications and microRNA mediators may be particularly important in the tolerogenic response. In this review, we discuss possible mechanisms to account for the phenomenon of LPS tolerance, with particular emphasis on the role of newly identified mediators.",

        "Abstract": "Toll-like receptor 11 (TLR11) recognizes T.\u00a0gondii profilin (TgPRF) and is required for interleukin-12 production and induction of immune responses that limit cyst burden in Toxoplasma gondii-infected mice. However, TLR11 only modestly affects survival of T.\u00a0gondii-challenged mice. We report that TLR12,\u00a0a previously uncharacterized TLR, also recognized TgPRF. TLR12 was sufficient for recognition of TgPRF by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), whereas TLR11 and TLR12 were both required in macrophages and conventional DCs. In contrast to TLR11, TLR12-deficient mice succumb rapidly to T.\u00a0gondii infection. TLR12-dependent induction of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b1 in pDCs led to production of IFN-\u03b3 by NK cells. Consistent with this observation, the partial resistance of Tlr11(-/-) mice is lost upon pDC or NK cell depletion. Thus, TLR12 is critical for the innate immune response to T.\u00a0gondii, and this TLR may promote host resistance by triggering pDC and NK cell function.",

        "Abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key molecular sensors used by the mammalian innate immune system to detect microorganisms. Although TLR functions in colonic immune homeostasis and tolerance to commensal bacteria have been intensively researched, the precise roles of different TLRs in response to pathogen infection in the gut remain elusive. Peyer patches are the major entrance of Salmonella infection and antigen transportation in intestine. Here, we report that, in contrast to TLR5 as a \"carrier of Salmonella,\" TLR11 works as a \"blocker of Salmonella\" to prevent highly invasive Salmonella from penetrating into the murine Peyer patches and spreading systemically. TLR11 plays an important role in mediating TNF-\u03b1 induction and systemic inflammation in response to Salmonella infection. Remarkably, in mice lacking TLR11, apparent hemorrhages at Peyer patches are induced by highly invasive Salmonella, a phenotype resembling human Salmonella infection. Therefore, our results indicate a potentially important role for TLR11 in preventing murine intestinal infection and modulating antigen transportation in the gut and imply an important role for various TLRs in cooperation with tight control of pathogens penetrating into Peyer patches. The TLR11 knock-out mouse can serve as a good animal model to study Salmonella infection.",

        "Abstract": "Salmonella spp. are gram-negative flagellated bacteria that can cause food- and waterborne gastroenteritis and typhoid fever in humans. We now report that flagellin from Salmonella spp. is recognized in mouse intestine by Toll-like receptor 11 (TLR11). Absence of TLR11 renders mice more susceptible to infection by S.\u00a0Typhimurium, with increased dissemination of the bacteria and enhanced lethality. Unlike S.\u00a0Typhimurium, S.\u00a0Typhi, a human obligatory pathogen that causes typhoid fever, is normally unable to infect mice. TLR11 is expressed in mice, but not in humans, and remarkably, we find that tlr11(-/-) mice are efficiently infected with orally administered S.\u00a0Typhi. We also find that tlr11(-/-) mice can be immunized against S.\u00a0Typhi. Therefore, tlr11(-/-) mice represent a small-animal model for the study of the immune response to S.\u00a0Typhi and for the development of vaccines against this important human pathogen.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common human neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement, balance, flexibility, and coordination. Despite intense investigation, no effective therapy is available to stop the onset PD or halt its progression. The primate model of PD is considered to be one of the best available models for human PD. Since neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PD and NF-\u03baB, a proinflammatory transcription factor, participates in the transcription of many proinflammatory molecules, this study evaluates the ability of a peptide corresponding to the NF-\u03baB essential modifier (NEMO)-binding domain (NBD) of I\u03baB kinase (IKK)\u03b1 or IKK\u03b2 to protect dopaminergic neurons in hemiparkinsonian monkeys. First, we found that NF-\u03baB was activated within the substantia nigra pars compacta of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated hemiparkinsonian monkeys. However, intramuscular injection of wild type NBD (wtNBD) peptide reduced nigral activation of NF-\u03baB and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, protected both the nigrostriatal axis and neurotransmitters, and improved motor functions in hemiparkinsonian monkeys. These findings were specific as mutated NBD peptide did not exhibit such effects. These results may help in the translation of NF-\u03baB-based therapy to PD clinics.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to sense and adjust to the environment is crucial to life. For multicellular organisms, the ability to respond to external changes is essential not only for survival but also for normal development and physiology. Although signaling events can directly modify cellular function, typically signaling acts to alter transcriptional responses to generate both transient and sustained changes. Rapid, but transient, changes in gene expression are mediated by inducible transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB. For the past 25 years, NF-\u03baB has served as a paradigm for inducible transcription factors and has provided numerous insights into how signaling events influence gene expression and physiology. Since its discovery as a regulator of expression of the \u03ba light chain gene in B cells, research on NF-\u03baB continues to yield new insights into fundamental cellular processes. Advances in understanding the mechanisms that regulate NF-\u03baB have been accompanied by progress in elucidating the biological significance of this transcription factor in various physiological processes. NF-\u03baB likely plays the most prominent role in the development and function of the immune system and, not surprisingly, when dysregulated, contributes to the pathophysiology of inflammatory disease. As our appreciation of the fundamental role of inflammation in disease pathogenesis has increased, so too has the importance of NF-\u03baB as a key regulatory molecule gained progressively greater significance. However, despite the tremendous progress that has been made in understanding the regulation of NF-\u03baB, there is much that remains to be understood. In this review, we highlight both the progress that has been made and the fundamental questions that remain unanswered after 25 years of study.",

TCR-mediated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) activation seems to be involved in differentiation of Treg cells because deletion of components of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, as well as of NF-\u03baB transcription factors, leads to markedly decreased Treg cell numbers in thymus and periphery.",

        "Abstract": "The innate immune system has a key role in the mammalian immune response. Recent research has demonstrated that mitochondria participate in a broad range of innate immune pathways, functioning as signalling platforms and contributing to effector responses. In addition to regulating antiviral signalling, mounting evidence suggests that mitochondria facilitate antibacterial immunity by generating reactive oxygen species and contribute to innate immune activation following cellular damage and stress. Therefore, in addition to their well-appreciated roles in cellular metabolism and programmed cell death, mitochondria appear to function as centrally positioned hubs in the innate immune system. Here, we review the emerging knowledge about the roles of mitochondria in innate immunity.",

        "Title": "TLR signalling augments macrophage bactericidal activity through mitochondrial ROS.",
        "Abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential components of the innate immune response against intracellular bacteria and it is thought that professional phagocytes generate ROS primarily via the phagosomal NADPH oxidase machinery. However, recent studies have suggested that mitochondrial ROS (mROS) also contribute to mouse macrophage bactericidal activity, although the mechanisms linking innate immune signalling to mitochondria for mROS generation remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that engagement of a subset of Toll-like receptors (TLR1, TLR2 and TLR4) results in the recruitment of mitochondria to macrophage phagosomes and augments mROS production. This response involves translocation of a TLR signalling adaptor, tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), to mitochondria, where it engages the protein ECSIT (evolutionarily conserved signalling intermediate in Toll pathways), which is implicated in mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly. Interaction with TRAF6 leads to ECSIT ubiquitination and enrichment at the mitochondrial periphery, resulting in increased mitochondrial and cellular ROS generation. ECSIT- and TRAF6-depleted macrophages have decreased levels of TLR-induced ROS and are significantly impaired in their ability to kill intracellular bacteria. Additionally, reducing macrophage mROS levels by expressing catalase in mitochondria results in defective bacterial killing, confirming the role of mROS in bactericidal activity. These results reveal a novel pathway linking innate immune signalling to mitochondria, implicate mROS as an important component of antibacterial responses and further establish mitochondria as hubs for innate immune signalling.",

        "Title": "T regulatory cells maintain intestinal homeostasis by suppressing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells.",
        "Abstract": "Immune tolerance against enteric commensal bacteria is important for preventing intestinal inflammation. Deletion of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (Pdk1) in T\u00a0cells via Cd4-Cre induced chronic inflammation of the intestine despite the importance of PDK1 in T\u00a0cell activation. Analysis of colonic intraepithelial lymphocytes of PDK1-deficient mice revealed markedly increased CD8\u03b1(+) T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR)\u03b3\u03b4(+) T\u00a0cells, including an interleukin-17 (IL-17)-expressing population. TCR\u03b3\u03b4(+) T\u00a0cells were responsible for the inflammatory colitis as shown by the fact that deletion of Tcrd abolished spontaneous colitis in the PDK1-deficient mice. This dysregulation of intestinal TCR\u03b3\u03b4(+) T\u00a0cells was attributable to a reduction in the number and functional capacity of PDK1-deficient T regulatory (Treg) cells. Adoptive transfer of wild-type Treg cells abrogated the spontaneous activation and proliferation of intestinal TCR\u03b3\u03b4(+) T\u00a0cells observed in PDK1-deficient mice and prevented the development of colitis. Therefore, suppression of intestinal TCR\u03b3\u03b4(+) T\u00a0cells by Treg cells maintains enteric immune tolerance.",

        "Abstract": "Profilins promote actin polymerization by exchanging ADP for ATP on monomeric actin and delivering ATP-actin to growing filament barbed ends. Apicomplexan protozoa such as Toxoplasma gondii invade host cells using an actin-dependent gliding motility. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 11 generates an innate immune response upon sensing T. gondii profilin (TgPRF). The crystal structure of TgPRF reveals a parasite-specific surface motif consisting of an acidic loop, followed by a long \u03b2-hairpin. A series of structure-based profilin mutants show that TLR11 recognition of the acidic loop is responsible for most of the interleukin (IL)-12 secretion response to TgPRF in peritoneal macrophages. Deletion of both the acidic loop and the \u03b2-hairpin completely abrogates IL-12 secretion. Insertion of the T. gondii acidic loop and \u03b2-hairpin into yeast profilin is sufficient to generate TLR11-dependent signaling. Substitution of the acidic loop in TgPRF with the homologous loop from the apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum does not affect TLR11-dependent IL-12 secretion, while substitution with the acidic loop from Plasmodium falciparum results in reduced but significant IL-12 secretion. We conclude that the parasite-specific motif in TgPRF is the key molecular pattern recognized by TLR11. Unlike other profilins, TgPRF slows nucleotide exchange on monomeric rabbit actin and binds rabbit actin weakly. The putative TgPRF actin-binding surface includes the \u03b2-hairpin and diverges widely from the actin-binding surfaces of vertebrate profilins.",

        "Title": "IkappaBbeta acts to inhibit and activate gene expression during the inflammatory response.",
        "Abstract": "The activation of pro-inflammatory gene programs by nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is primarily regulated through cytoplasmic sequestration of NF-kappaB by the inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) family of proteins. IkappaBbeta, a major isoform of IkappaB, can sequester NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm, although its biological role remains unclear. Although cells lacking IkappaBbeta have been reported, in vivo studies have been limited and suggested redundancy between IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta. Like IkappaBalpha, IkappaBbeta is also inducibly degraded; however, upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), it is degraded slowly and re-synthesized as a hypophosphorylated form that can be detected in the nucleus. The crystal structure of IkappaBbeta bound to p65 suggested this complex might bind DNA. In vitro, hypophosphorylated IkappaBbeta can bind DNA with p65 and c-Rel, and the DNA-bound NF-kappaB:IkappaBbeta complexes are resistant to IkappaBalpha, suggesting hypophosphorylated, nuclear IkappaBbeta may prolong the expression of certain genes. Here we report that in vivo IkappaBbeta serves both to inhibit and facilitate the inflammatory response. IkappaBbeta degradation releases NF-kappaB dimers which upregulate pro-inflammatory target genes such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Surprisingly, absence of IkappaBbeta results in a dramatic reduction of TNF-alpha in response to LPS even though activation of NF-kappaB is normal. The inhibition of TNF-alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) expression correlates with the absence of nuclear, hypophosphorylated-IkappaBbeta bound to p65:c-Rel heterodimers at a specific kappaB site on the TNF-alpha promoter. Therefore IkappaBbeta acts through p65:c-Rel dimers to maintain prolonged expression of TNF-alpha. As a result, IkappaBbeta(-/-) mice are resistant to LPS-induced septic shock and collagen-induced arthritis. Blocking IkappaBbeta might be a promising new strategy for selectively inhibiting the chronic phase of TNF-alpha production during the inflammatory response.",

        "Abstract": "NF-kappaB is well established as a key component of the inflammatory response. However, the precise mechanisms through which NF-kappaB activation contributes to inflammatory disease states remain poorly defined. To test the role of NF-kappaB in inflammation, we created a knock-in mouse that expresses a constitutively active form of NF-kappaB p65 dimers. These mice are born at normal Mendelian ratios, but display a progressive, systemic hyperinflammatory condition that results in severe runting and, typically, death 8-20 d after birth. Examination of homozygous knock-in mice demonstrates significant increases in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Remarkably, crossing this strain with mice lacking TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) leads to a complete rescue of the hyperinflammatory phenotype. However, upon aging, these rescued mice begin to display chronic keratitis accompanied by increased corneal expression of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and MMP-9, similar to that seen in human keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) or \"dry eyes.\" Therefore, our results show that, while constitutively active NF-kappaB can trigger systemic inflammation, it does so indirectly, through increased TNF production. However, certain inflammatory disease states, such as keratitis or KCS, a condition that is seen in Sjogren's syndrome, are dependent on NF-kappaB, but are independent of TNFR1 signaling.",

        "Title": "The NF-kappaB family of transcription factors and its regulation.",
        "Abstract": "Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) consists of a family of transcription factors that play critical roles in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Inducible NF-kappaB activation depends on phosphorylation-induced proteosomal degradation of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB proteins (IkappaBs), which retain inactive NF-kappaB dimers in the cytosol in unstimulated cells. The majority of the diverse signaling pathways that lead to NF-kappaB activation converge on the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, which is responsible for IkappaB phosphorylation and is essential for signal transduction to NF-kappaB. Additional regulation of NF-kappaB activity is achieved through various post-translational modifications of the core components of the NF-kappaB signaling pathways. In addition to cytosolic modifications of IKK and IkappaB proteins, as well as other pathway-specific mediators, the transcription factors are themselves extensively modified. Tremendous progress has been made over the last two decades in unraveling the elaborate regulatory networks that control the NF-kappaB response. This has made the NF-kappaB pathway a paradigm for understanding general principles of signal transduction and gene regulation.",

        "Abstract": "Naturally derived regulatory T (Treg) cells are characterized by stable expression of the transcription factor Foxp3 and characteristic epigenetic imprinting at the Foxp3 gene locus. Here, we found that enhancing nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity via a constitutive active inhibitor of kappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) transgene in T cells led to increased number of Foxp3(+) cells in the thymus and can rescue Foxp3 expression in thymocytes deficient in other pleiotropic signaling molecules. Enhancing the signal strength of the NF-kappaB pathway also induced Foxp3 expression in otherwise conventionally selected T cells. NF-kappaB directly promoted the transcription of Foxp3, and upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, c-Rel, a NF-kappaB family member, bound to Foxp3 enhancer region, which is specifically demethylated in natural Treg cells. Hence, NF-kappaB signaling pathway is a key regulator of Foxp3 expression during natural Treg cell development.",

        "Abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Brucella species cause chronic infections that can result in undulant fever, arthritis, and osteomyelitis in humans. Remarkably, Brucella sp. genomes encode a protein, named TcpB, that bears significant homology with mammalian Toll/IL-1 receptor domains and whose expression causes degradation of the phosphorylated, signal competent form of the adapter MyD88-adapter-like (MAL). This effect of TcpB is mediated through its box 1 region and has no effect on other TLR adapter proteins such as MyD88 or TIR-domain containing adapter protein-inducing IFNbeta. TcpB also does not affect a mutant, signal-incompetent form of MAL that cannot be phosphorylated. Interestingly, the presence of TcpB leads to enhanced polyubiquitination of MAL, which is likely responsible for its accelerated degradation. A Brucella abortus mutant lacking TcpB fails to reduce levels of MAL in infected macrophages. Therefore, TcpB represents a unique pathogen-derived molecule that suppresses host innate-immune responses by specifically targeting an individual adapter molecule in the TLR signaling pathway for degradation.",

In this study, we report an increase in apoptotic T cells from RCC patients compared with T cells from normal donors that coincided with the detection of T cells staining positive for GM2 and that the apoptosis was predominantly observed in the GM2(+) but not the GM2(-) T cell population. Ganglioside shedding from tumor rather than endogenous production accounts for GM2(+) T cells since there was no detectable level of mRNA for GM2 synthase in RCC patient T cells and in T cells from normal healthy donors after incubation with either purified GM2 or supernatant from RCC cell lines despite their staining positive for GM2. Moreover, reactive oxygen species as well as activated caspase 3, 8, and 9 were predominantly elevated in GM2(+) but not GM2(-) T cells. Similarly, increased staining for GD2 and GD3 but not GD1a was detected with patient T cells with elevated levels of apoptosis in the GD2(+) and GD3(+) cells. These findings suggest that GM2, GD2, and GD3 play a significant role in immune dysfunction observed in RCC patient T cells.",

        "Abstract": "The innate immune system provides an initial defense system against microbial infections and contributes to the development of adaptive immune response. Type I interferons play a pivotal role for the first line of defense against virus infections, and dendritic cells (DCs) are important sensors of pathogens responsible for priming of adaptive immune responses in lymphoid organs. Here we have investigated the role and mechanisms of activation of the MAPK pathway in innate immune responses induced by Sendai virus, a negative sense single-stranded RNA virus. Both p38 and JNK were activated in fibroblasts and DCs after infection with Sendai virus in a manner dependent on virus replication and RIG-I. Virus replication was also required for stimulation of interferon production in both cell types and interleukin-12 production in DCs. Blocking of p38 MAPK activation by the specific inhibitor SB202190 abolished the expression of these cytokines. p38 MAPK exerted its function independent of the MAPK-activated protein kinases MK2, MNK, and MSK1/2. We also observed that TRAF2 and TAK1 were essential for RIG-I-mediated activation of p38 MAPK. Interestingly, the kinase activity of p38 MAPK was required for its own phosphorylation, which was kinetically associated with TAB1 interaction. By contrast, the canonical p38 upstream kinase MKK3 was not involved in the p38-dependent response. Thus, activation of p38 MAPK by RIG-I proceeds via a TRAF2-TAK1-dependent pathway, where the enzymatic activity of the kinase plays an essential role. The p38 MAPK in turn stimulates important processes in the innate antiviral response.",

        "Abstract": "In addition to ligation of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), activation of the CD28 coreceptor by the costimulatory molecule B7 is required for induction of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and robust T cell activation, although the contribution of CD28 to this process remains incompletely understood. We show here that phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is essential for integrating the TCR and CD28 signals. After we deleted PDK1 from T cells, TCR-CD28 signals were unable to induce activation of NF-kappaB or phosphorylation of protein kinase C-theta, although T cell survival and pathways dependent on the kinases p38 and Jnk or the transcription factor NFAT were unaffected. CD28 facilitated NF-kappaB activation by regulating recruitment and phosphorylation of PDK1, which are necessary for efficient binding of PDK1 to protein kinase C-theta and the adaptor CARMA1 and thus for NF-kappaB induction.",

        "Abstract": "Inhibition of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity leads to a reduction in numbers of CD8(+) single-positive (SP) thymocytes, suggesting a selective role for NF-kappaB in these cells. To further explore the role of NF-kappaB in SP thymocytes, we utilized transgenic models that allowed either inhibition or activation of NF-kappaB. We showed that activation of NF-kappaB played an important role in the selection of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted CD8(+) T cells. Surprisingly, NF-kappaB was not activated in positively selected CD4(+) thymocytes, and inhibition of NF-kappaB did not perturb positive or negative selection of CD4(+) cells. However, enforced activation of NF-kappaB via a constitutively active inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) kinase transgene led to a nearly complete deletion of CD4 cells by pushing positively selecting CD4(+) cells into negative selection. These studies therefore revealed a surprising difference of NF-kappaB activation in CD4(+) and CD8(+) thymocytes and suggested that NF-kappaB contributes to the establishment of thresholds of signaling that determine positive or negative selection of thymocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Research on the biological function of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), a key mediator of inducible transcription in the immune system, has traditionally focused on its role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses. These studies have largely concentrated on the mechanisms of signalling that lead to NF-kappaB activation and on the positive role of NF-kappaB in both physiological immunity and pathological inflammation. More recently, there has been growing interest in the mechanisms that directly regulate the NF-kappaB transcriptional programmes. As a result, several new NF-kappaB regulatory components have been identified and some of the known components have been assigned new roles. In this Review, we discuss these new insights into the regulation of NF-kappaB.",

        "Abstract": "Cells from a \"knock-in\" mouse expressing a NF-kappaB p65 mutant bearing an alanine instead of serine at position 276 (S276A) display a significant reduction of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription, even though the mutant p65 forms appropriate complexes that translocate normally to the nucleus and bind to DNA. Surprisingly, however, instead of the expected embryonic lethality from hepatocyte apoptosis seen in the absence of NF-kappaB activity, the S276A knock-in embryos die at different embryonic days due to variegated developmental abnormalities. We now demonstrate that this variegated phenotype is due to epigenetic repression resulting from the recruitment of histone deacetylases by the nonphosphorylatable form of NF-kappaB into the vicinity of genes positioned fortuitously near NF-kappaB-binding sites. Therefore, unphosphorylated nuclear NF-kappaB can affect expression of genes not normally regulated by NF-kappaB through epigenetic mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "The protein kinase TAK1 (transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1), which has been implicated in the activation of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascades and the production of inflammatory mediators by LPS (lipopolysaccharide), IL-1 (interleukin 1) and TNF (tumour necrosis factor), comprises the catalytic subunit complexed to the regulatory subunits, termed TAB (TAK1-binding subunit) 1 and either TAB2 or TAB3. We have previously identified a feedback-control mechanism by which p38alpha MAPK down-regulates TAK1 and showed that p38alpha MAPK phosphorylates TAB1 at Ser(423) and Thr(431). In the present study, we identified two IL-1-stimulated phosphorylation sites on TAB2 (Ser(372) and Ser(524)) and three on TAB3 (Ser(60), Thr(404) and Ser(506)) in human IL-1R cells [HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells that stably express the IL-1 receptor] and MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts). Ser(372) and Ser(524) of TAB2 are not phosphorylated by pathways dependent on p38alpha/beta MAPKs, ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) and JNK1/2 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2). In contrast, Ser(60) and Thr(404) of TAB3 appear to be phosphorylated directly by p38alpha MAPK, whereas Ser(506) is phosphorylated by MAPKAP-K2/MAPKAP-K3 (MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 and 3), which are protein kinases activated by p38alpha MAPK. Studies using TAB1(-/-) MEFs indicate important roles for TAB1 in recruiting p38alpha MAPK to the TAK1 complex for the phosphorylation of TAB3 at Ser(60) and Thr(404) and in inhibiting the dephosphorylation of TAB3 at Ser(506). TAB1 is also required to induce TAK1 catalytic activity, since neither IL-1 nor TNFalpha was able to stimulate detectable TAK1 activity in TAB1(-/-) MEFs. Surprisingly, the IL-1 and TNFalpha-stimulated activation of MAPK cascades and IkappaB (inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaB) kinases were similar in TAB1(-/-), MEKK3(-/-) [MAPK/ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) kinase kinase 3] and wild-type MEFs, suggesting that another MAP3K (MAPK kinase kinase) may mediate the IL-1/TNFalpha-induced activation of these signalling pathways in TAB1(-/-) and MEKK3(-/-) MEFs.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Despite intense investigations, no effective therapy is available to stop its onset or halt its progression. The present study evaluates the ability of peptide corresponding to the NF-kappaB essential modifier-binding domain (NBD) of IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) or IKKbeta to prevent nigrostriatal degeneration in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD and establish a role for NF-kappaB in human parkinsonism. First, we found that NF-kappaB was activated within the substantia nigra pars compacta of PD patients and MPTP-intoxicated mice. However, i.p. injection of wild-type NBD peptide reduced nigral activation of NF-kappaB, suppressed nigral microglial activation, protected both the nigrostriatal axis and neurotransmitters, and improved motor functions in MPTP-intoxicated mice. These findings were specific because mutated NBD peptide had no effect. We conclude that selective inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by NBD peptide may be of therapeutic benefit for PD patients.",

        "Title": "Inhibition of NF-kappaB activation reduces the tissue effects of transgenic IL-13.",
        "Abstract": "IL-13 is a major Th2 cytokine that is capable of inducing inflammation, excessive mucus production, airway hyperresponsiveness, alveolar remodeling, and fibrosis in the murine lung. Although IL-13 through its binding to IL-4Ralpha/IL-13Ralpha1 uses the canonical STAT6-signaling pathway to mediate these tissue responses, recent studies have demonstrated that other signaling pathways may also be involved. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that IL-13 mediates its tissue effects by inducing a wide variety of downstream genes many of which are known to be regulated by NF-kappaB. As a result, we hypothesized that NF-kappaB activation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of IL-13-induced tissue alterations. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of transgenic IL-13 in mice with normal and diminished levels of NF-kappaB activity. Three pharmacologic approaches were used to inhibit NF-kappaB including 1) PS1145, a small molecule inhibitor of IkappaBalpha kinase (IKK2), 2) antennapedia-linked NF-kappaB essential modulator-binding domain (NBD) peptide (wild-type NBD), and 3) an adenoviral construct expressing a dominant-negative version of IKK2. We also crossed IL-13-transgenic mice with mice with null mutations of p50 to generate mice that overproduced IL-13 in the presence and absence of this NF-kappaB component. These studies demonstrate that all these interventions reduced IL-13-induced tissue inflammation, fibrosis and alveolar remodeling. In addition, we show that both PS1145 and wild-type NBD inhibit lung inflammatory and structural cell apoptosis. PS1145 inhibits caspase activation and up-regulates inhibitor of apoptosis protein cellular-inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (c-IAP-1). Therefore, NF-kappaB is an attractive target for immunotherapy of IL-13-mediated diseases.",

        "Abstract": "The IkappaB-Kinase (IKK) complex is a multisubunit protein complex crucial for signal-induced phosphorylation of the IkappaB proteins and thus controls the activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Besides the two kinases IKKalpha and IKKbeta, the IKK complex contains NEMO/IKKgamma, an additional subunit with regulatory and adaptor functions. NEMO not only confers structural stability to the IKK complex but also participates in the activation process of the IKK complex by linking the IKK subunits to upstream activators. In this study we analyze the IKKbeta-mediated phosphorylation of the IKK-binding domain of NEMO. In vitro, IKKbeta phosphorylates three serine residues in the domain of NEMO at positions 43, 68, and 85. However, mutational analysis revealed that only the phosphorylation of serine 68 in the center of the IKK-binding domain plays an essential role for the formation and the function of the IKK complex. Thus, Ser(68) phosphorylation attenuates the amino-terminal dimerization of NEMO as well as the IKKbeta-NEMO interaction. In contrast, the NEMO-IKKalpha interaction was only mildly affected by the phosphorylation of Ser(68). However, functional analysis revealed that Ser(68) phosphorylation primarily affects the activity of IKKalpha. Furthermore, in complementation experiments of NEMO-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts, a S68A-NEMO mutant enhanced, whereas a S68E mutant decreased, TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activity, thus emphasizing the inhibitory role of the Ser(68) phosphorylation on the signal-induced NF-kappaB activity. Finally, we provide evidence that the protein phosphatase PP2A is involved in the regulation of the Ser(68)-based mechanism. In summary, we provide evidence for a signal-induced phosphorylation-dependent alteration of the IKK complex emphasizing the dynamic nature of this multisubunit kinase complex.",

        "Title": "Involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated up-regulation of I kappa B alpha in anti-inflammatory effect of gemfibrozil in microglia.",
        "Abstract": "The present study underlines the importance of PI3K in mediating the anti-inflammatory effect of gemfibrozil, a prescribed lipid-lowering drug for humans, in mouse microglia. Gemfibrozil inhibited LPS-induced expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and proinflammatory cytokines in mouse BV-2 microglial cells and primary microglia. By overexpressing wild-type and dominant-negative constructs of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) in microglial cells and isolating primary microglia from PPAR-alpha-/- mice, we have demonstrated that gemfibrozil inhibits the activation of microglia independent of PPAR-alpha. Interestingly, gemfibrozil induced the activation of p85alpha-associated PI3K (p110beta but not p110alpha) and inhibition of that PI3K by either chemical inhibitors or dominant-negative mutants abrogated the inhibitory effect of gemfibrozil. Conversely, overexpression of the constitutively active mutant of p110 enhanced the inhibitory effect of gemfibrozil on LPS-induced expression of proinflammatory molecules. Similarly, gemfibrozil also inhibited fibrillar amyloid beta (Abeta)-, prion peptide (PrP)-, dsRNA (poly IC)-, HIV-1 Tat-, and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-, but not IFN-gamma-, induced microglial expression of iNOS. Inhibition of PI3K also abolished the inhibitory effect of gemfibrozil on Abeta-, PrP-, poly IC-, Tat-, and MPP+-induced microglial expression of iNOS. Involvement of NF-kappaB activation in LPS-, Abeta-, PrP-, poly IC-, Tat-, and MPP+-, but not IFN-gamma-, induced microglial expression of iNOS and stimulation of IkappaBalpha expression and inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by gemfibrozil via the PI3K pathway suggests that gemfibrozil inhibits the activation of NF-kappaB and the expression of proinflammatory molecules in microglia via PI3K-mediated up-regulation of IkappaBalpha.",

        "Abstract": "Ligation of CD40 on dendritic cells (DCs) induces early production of inflammatory mediators via canonical NF-kappaB signaling, as well as late expression of the anti-inflammatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) via unknown signal transduction. By selective blocking of either the canonical NF-kappaB pathway using the NEMO-binding domain peptide or the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway by small interfering RNA, we demonstrate that IDO expression requires noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling. Also, noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling down-regulates proinflammatory cytokine production in DCs. In addition, selective activation of the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway results in noninflammatory DCs that suppress T-cell activation and promote the development of T cells with regulatory properties. These findings reveal an important role of the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway in the regulation of immunity.",

        "Title": "TNF-alpha induction of GM2 expression on renal cell carcinomas promotes T cell dysfunction.",
        "Abstract": "Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated the role of tumor-derived gangliosides as important mediators of T cell apoptosis, and hence, as one mechanism by which tumors evade immune destruction. In this study, we report that TNF-alpha secreted by infiltrating inflammatory cells and/or genetically modified tumors augments tumor-associated GM2 levels, which leads to T cell death and immune dysfunction. The conversion of weakly apoptogenic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) clones to lines that can induce T cell death requires 3-5 days of TNF-alpha pretreatment, a time frame paralleling that needed for TNF-alpha to stimulate GM2 accumulation by SK-RC-45, SK-RC-54, and SK-RC-13. RCC tumor cell lines permanently transfected with the TNF-alpha transgene are similarly toxic for T lymphocytes, which correlates with their constitutively elevated levels of GM2. TNF-alpha increases GM2 ganglioside expression by enhancing the mRNA levels encoding its synthetic enzyme, GM2 synthase, as demonstrated by both RT-PCR and Southern analysis. The contribution of GM2 gangliosides to tumor-induced T cell death was supported by the finding that anti-GM2 Abs significantly blocked T cell apoptosis mediated by TNF-alpha-treated tumor cells, and by the observation that small interfering RNA directed against TNF-alpha abrogated GM2 synthase expression by TNF-transfected SK-RC-45, diminished its GM2 accumulation, and inhibited its apoptogenicity for T lymphocytes. Our results indicate that TNF-alpha signaling promotes RCC-induced killing of T cells by stimulating the acquisition of a distinct ganglioside assembly in RCC tumor cells.",

        "Abstract": "The survivability of embryo, especially during the early embryonic life is dependent on the effective maternal recognition of pregnancy. Interferon-tau (IFNT), secreted from the elongating blastocyst, acts as the primary signal for maternal recognition of pregnancy in ruminant ungulates. IFNT has been studied extensively in many domesticated and wild ruminant species. In the present study, we have cloned and characterized the IFNT gene of Garole sheep, a popular Indian micro-sheep breed, which is known across the world for its high prolificacy and fecundity. The 588 bp sequences of two variants of IFNT gene described in this study are novel variants, compared to the variants reported previously in sheep. It exhibited more than 96% identity with other ovine IFNT variants and phylogenetically placed in a single clad containing the ovine, caprine and musk ox IFNT variants. The IFNT of Garole sheep demonstrated the highest identity with the genomic derived and highly expressed ovine IFNT variants.",

        "Abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal X-linked disorder associated with dystrophin deficiency that results in chronic inflammation and severe skeletal muscle degeneration. In DMD mouse models and patients, we find that IkappaB kinase/NF-kappaB (IKK/NF-kappaB) signaling is persistently elevated in immune cells and regenerative muscle fibers. Ablation of 1 allele of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB was sufficient to improve pathology in mdx mice, a model of DMD. In addition, conditional deletion of IKKbeta in mdx mice elucidated that NF-kappaB functions in activated macrophages to promote inflammation and muscle necrosis and in skeletal muscle fibers to limit regeneration through the inhibition of muscle progenitor cells. Furthermore, specific pharmacological inhibition of IKK resulted in improved pathology and muscle function in mdx mice. Collectively, these results underscore the critical role of NF-kappaB in the progression of muscular dystrophy and suggest the IKK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target for DMD.",

        "Abstract": "Signal transduction events leading to the survival, differentiation, or apoptosis of cells of the innate or adaptive immune system must be properly coordinated to ensure the normal mounting and termination of immune responses. One of the key transcription factors in immune responses is nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), which has been the focus of intense investigation over the past two decades. With the identification of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex and ongoing progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms connecting T cell and B cell receptor proximal signals to the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, a cohesive model of antigen receptor (AgR)-dependent signaling to NF-kappaB activation is beginning to emerge. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of research into the mechanisms that regulate AgR-mediated NF-kappaB transcriptional activity, with particular focus on the events leading to activation of the IKK complex.",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that peptides corresponding to a six-amino-acid NEMO-binding domain from the C terminus of IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) and IKKbeta can disrupt the IKK complex and block NF-kappaB activation. We have now mapped and characterized the corresponding amino-terminal IKK-binding domain (IBD) of NEMO. Peptides corresponding to the IBD were efficiently recruited to the IKK complex but displayed only a weak inhibitory potential on cytokine-induced NF-kappaB activity. This is most likely due to the formation of sodium dodecyl sulfate- and urea-resistant NEMO dimers through a dimerization domain at the amino terminus of NEMO that overlaps with the region responsible for binding to IKKs. Mutational analysis revealed different alpha-helical subdomains within an amino-terminal coiled-coil region are important for NEMO dimerization and IKKbeta binding. Furthermore, NEMO dimerization is required for the tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, even when interaction with the IKKs is unaffected. Hence, our data provide novel insights into the role of the amino terminus of NEMO for the architecture of the IKK complex and its activation.",

        "Abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane proteins that detect invading pathogens by binding conserved, microbially derived molecules and that induce signaling cascades for proinflammatory gene expression. A critical component of the innate immune system, TLRs utilize leucine-rich-repeat motifs for ligand binding and a shared cytoplasmic domain to recruit the adaptors MyD88, TRIF, TIRAP, and/or TRAM for downstream signaling. Despite significant domain conservation, TLRs induce gene programs that lead not only to the robust production of general proinflammatory mediators but also to the production of unique effectors, which provide pathogen-tailored immune responses. Here we review the mechanisms by which TLRs recognize pathogens and induce distinct signaling cascades.",

        "Title": "Lipopolysaccharide induces CXCL2/macrophage inflammatory protein-2 gene expression in enterocytes via NF-kappaB activation: independence from endogenous TNF-alpha and platelet-activating factor.",
        "Abstract": "CXCL2 (macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2)), a critical chemokine for neutrophils, has been shown to be produced in the rat intestine in response to platelet-activating factor (PAF) and to mediate intestinal inflammation and injury. The intestinal epithelium, constantly exposed to bacterial products, is the first line of defence against micro-organisms. It has been reported that enterocytes produce proinflammatory mediators, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and PAF, and we showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TNF activate nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in enterocytes. However, it remains elusive whether enterocytes release CXCL2 in response to LPS and TNF via a NF-kappaB-dependent pathway and whether this involves the endogenous production of TNF and PAF. In this study, we found that TNF and LPS markedly induced CXCL2 gene expression in IEC-6 cells, TNF within 30 min, peaking at 45 min, while LPS more slowly, peaking after 2 hr. TNF- and LPS- induced CXCL2 gene expression and protein release were completely blocked by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and helenalin, two potent NF-kappaB inhibitors. NEMO-binding domain peptide, a specific inhibitor of inhibitor protein kappaB kinase (IKK) activation, a major upstream kinase mediating NF-kappaB activation, significantly blocked CXCL2 gene expression and protein release induced by LPS. WEB2170 (PAF antagonist) and anti-TNF antibodies had no effect on LPS-induced CXCL2 expression. In conclusion, CXCL2 gene is expressed in enterocytes in response to both TNF and LPS. LPS-induced CXCL2 expression is dependent on NF-kappaB activation via the IKK pathway. The effect of LPS is independent of endogenous TNF and PAF.",

        "Title": "Local treatment with the selective IkappaB kinase beta inhibitor NEMO-binding domain peptide ameliorates synovial inflammation.",
        "Abstract": "Nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB is a key regulator of synovial inflammation. We investigated the effect of local NF-kappaB inhibition in rat adjuvant arthritis (AA), using the specific IkappaB kinase (IKK)-beta blocking NF-kappaB essential modulator-binding domain (NBD) peptide. The effects of the NBD peptide on human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and macrophages, as well as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) whole-tissue biopsies, were also evaluated. First, we investigated the effects of the NBD peptide on RA FLS in vitro. Subsequently, NBD peptides were administered intra-articularly into the right ankle joint of rats at the onset of disease. The severity of arthritis was monitored over time, rats were sacrificed on day 20, and tissue specimens were collected for routine histology and x-rays of the ankle joints. Human macrophages or RA synovial tissues were cultured ex vivo in the presence or absence of NBD peptides, and cytokine production was measured in the supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The NBD peptide blocked interleukin (IL)-1-beta-induced IkappaB alpha phosphorylation and IL-6 production in RA FLS. Intra-articular injection of the NBD peptide led to significantly reduced severity of arthritis (p < 0.0001) and reduced radiological damage (p = 0.04). This was associated with decreased synovial cellularity and reduced expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-1-beta in the synovium. Incubation of human macrophages with NBD peptides resulted in 50% inhibition of IL-1-beta-induced TNF-alpha production in the supernatant (p < 0.01). In addition, the NBD peptide decreased TNF-alpha-induced IL-6 production by human RA synovial tissue biopsies by approximately 42% (p < 0.01). Specific NF-kappaB blockade using a small peptide inhibitor of IKK-beta has anti-inflammatory effects in AA and human RA synovial tissue as well as in two important cell types in the pathogenesis of RA: macrophages and FLS. These results indicate that IKK-beta-targeted NF-kappaB blockade using the NBD peptide could offer a new approach for the local treatment of arthritis.",

        "Abstract": "Levels of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB)/Rel family of proteins are carefully modulated in differentiating lymphocytes, where these transcription factors are thought to be important for survival and fate decisions. In contrast, gene-targeting experiments have not revealed clear roles for these transcription factors in lymphopoiesis within bone marrow. Inhibition of NF-kappaB by introduction of mutated I kappa B alpha, a 'superinhibitor' of NF-kappaB, into hematopoietic stem cells or early progenitors suppressed B as well as T lymphopoiesis following transplantation into immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, a NF-kappaB essential modifier-binding domain (NBD) peptide that blocks IKB kinase (IKK) activity selectively impaired the generation of adult B lineage cells. However, this suppression did not occur when a neutralizing antibody to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) was added to the cultures, or in circumstances where few non-lymphoid cells were present. We conclude that while NF-kappaB plays a survival-promoting role in lymphoid progenitors, this may only be significant in circumstances such as transplantation when levels of TNFalpha are high.",

        "Abstract": "Charged MVB protein 5 (CHMP5) is a coiled coil protein homologous to the yeast Vps60/Mos10 gene and other ESCRT-III complex members, although its precise function in either yeast or mammalian cells is unknown. We deleted the CHMP5 gene in mice, resulting in a phenotype of early embryonic lethality, reflecting defective late endosome function and dysregulation of signal transduction. Chmp5-/- cells exhibit enlarged late endosomal compartments that contain abundant internal vesicles expressing proteins that are characteristic of late endosomes and lysosomes. This is in contrast to ESCRT-III mutants in yeast, which are defective in multivesicular body (MVB) formation. The degradative capacity of Chmp5-/- cells was reduced, and undigested proteins from multiple pathways accumulated in enlarged MVBs that failed to traffic their cargo to lysosomes. Therefore, CHMP5 regulates late endosome function downstream of MVB formation, and the loss of CHMP5 enhances signal transduction by inhibiting lysosomal degradation of activated receptors.",

        "Abstract": "Bone metabolism is regulated by hormonal or local factors in the bone microenvironment, and recent studies have revealed that bone homeostasis is also influenced by immune system. The term 'osteoimmunology' has been proposed to explain the cross-talk between bone and the immune system. A critical element in this cross-talk is the inducible transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which regulates gene expression during inflammatory and immune responses. However, NF-kappaB-signaling pathways are also important for bone homeostasis, in particular for osteoclast differentiation. By bridging inflammation and bone homeostasis, NF-kappaB also contributes to the onset and progression of arthritis. Several natural compounds, synthetic drugs, and gene-transfer technologies that lead to inhibition of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB activation pathway can prevent arthritis in animal models. In this review, we discuss the signaling pathway that leads to NF-kappaB activation and the role of NF-kappaB on osteoclast differentiation. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility that inhibition of NF-kappaB might provide novel therapeutic approach for inhibiting bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "Title": "TAK1, but not TAB1 or TAB2, plays an essential role in multiple signaling pathways in vivo.",
        "Abstract": "TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a member of the MAPKKK family, is thought to be a key modulator of the inducible transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1 and, therefore, plays a crucial role in regulating the genes that mediate inflammation. Although in vitro biochemical studies have revealed the existence of a TAK1 complex, which includes TAK1 and the adapter proteins TAB1 and TAB2, it remains unclear which members of this complex are essential for signaling. To analyze the function of TAK1 in vivo, we have deleted the Tak1 gene in mice, with the resulting phenotype being early embryonic lethality. Using embryonic fibroblasts lacking TAK1, TAB1, or TAB2, we have found that TNFR1, IL-1R, TLR3, and TLR4-mediated NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation are severely impaired in Tak1(m/m) cells, but they are normal in Tab1(-/-) and Tab2(-/-) cells. In addition, Tak1(m/m) cells are highly sensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis. TAK1 mediates IKK activation in TNF-alpha and IL-1 signaling pathways, where it functions downstream of RIP1-TRAF2 and MyD88-IRAK1-TRAF6, respectively. However, TAK1 is not required for NF-kappaB activation through the alternative pathway following LT-beta signaling. In the TGF-beta signaling pathway, TAK1 deletion leads to impaired NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation without impacting Smad2 activation or TGF-beta-induced gene expression. Therefore, our studies suggests that TAK1 acts as an upstream activating kinase for IKKbeta and JNK, but not IKKalpha, revealing an unexpectedly specific role of TAK1 in inflammatory signaling pathways.",

        "Abstract": "The regulation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) during B-cell development was examined using cells isolated from the bone marrow of transgenic mice expressing a kappaB luciferase reporter gene. The results indicate that the highest level of NF-kappaB activity is present in cells expressing the pre-B-cell receptor. Furthermore, cross-linking of Igbeta on CD43(+) pre-B cells is able to activate NF-kappaB in recombination-activating gene 1-deficient mice, preceding their further differentiation into CD43(-) pre-B cells. Expression of a dominant negative form of IkappaBalpha using a transgenic approach or by retroviral infection leads to a reduction in the number of CD43(+) pre-B cells. These data therefore indicate that activation of NF-kappaB in CD43(+) pre-B cells, as a result of signaling by the pre-B-cell receptor, facilitates the continued development of large, CD43(+) pre-B cells into small CD43(-) pre-B cells.",

        "Title": "Regulating inducible transcription through controlled localization.",
        "Abstract": "Many signaling pathways regulate the activity of effector transcription factors by controlling their subcellular localization. Until recently, the cytoplasmic retention of inactive transcription factors was mainly attributed to binding partners that mask the nuclear localization signals (NLSs) of target proteins. Inactive transcription factors were thought to be exclusively cytoplasmic until their activation, after which the NLSs were unmasked to allow nuclear translocation. There is now a growing body of evidence, however, that challenges this simple model. This review discusses recent reports that suggest that inducible transcription factors can constantly shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and that their apparent cytoplasmic retention can be achieved by binding partners that mask the NLSs, tether the transcription factor to cytoplasmic structures, or mark the transcription factor for proteasomal degradation. We also discuss the possibility that this more complex model of cytoplasmic retention might be applicable to a broader range of transcription factors and their associated signaling pathways.",

Although TLRs are clearly involved in the detection of bacteria and viruses, relatively little is known about their function in the innate response to eukaryotic microorganisms. Here we identify a profilin-like molecule from the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii that generates a potent interleukin-12 (IL-12) response in murine DCs that is dependent on myeloid differentiation factor 88. T. gondii profilin activates DCs through TLR11 and is the first chemically defined ligand for this TLR. Moreover, TLR11 is required in vivo for parasite-induced IL-12 production and optimal resistance to infection, thereby establishing a role for the receptor in host recognition of protozoan pathogens.",

        "Abstract": "Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB after engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) is important for T cell proliferation and activation during the adaptive immune response. Recent reports have elucidated a signaling pathway that involves the protein kinase C (PKC), the scaffold protein CARD11 (also called CARMA-1), the caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing protein Bcl10, and the paracaspase (protease related to caspases) MALT1 as critical intermediates linking the TCR to the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex. However, the events proximal to the TCR that initiate the activation of this signaling pathway remain poorly defined. We demonstrate that 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) has an essential role in this pathway by regulating the activation of PKC and through signal-dependent recruiting of both PKC and CARD11 to lipid rafts. PDK1-associated PKC recruits the IKK complex, whereas PDK1-associated CARD11 recruits the Bcl10-MALT1 complex, thereby allowing activation of the IKK complex through Bcl10-MALT1-dependent ubiquitination of the IKK complex subunit known as NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modifier). Hence, PDK1 plays a critical role by nucleating the TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation pathway in T cells.",

        "Abstract": "Dendritic cells (DC) are the only antigen-presenting cells for naive T cells and, therefore, they are crucial players in the initiation of immune responses. Because DC maturation and cytokine production are NF-kappaB dependent, we hypothesized that blocking NF-kappaB activity in DC by selectively targeting the inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) kinase (IKK) complex using the novel NF-kappaB inhibitor NEMO-binding domain (NBD) peptide could inhibit DC maturation and other functional characteristics, resulting in modulation of the immune response. We used human monocyte-derived DC to test the biological effects of the NBD peptide in vitro. NF-kappaB inhibition by the NBD peptide resulted in blockade of IKK-mediated IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-kappaB p65 in DC. In addition, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-alpha production was dose-dependently blocked and NBD peptide treatment also led to a strong reduction of LPS-induced maturation. Functional analysis of these DC showed marked inhibition of T cell proliferation in the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction, accompanied by less Th1 and Th2 polarization. The current study reveals for the first time the unique properties of this novel, highly specific NF-kappaB inhibitor in DC. Also, these data indicate that the NBD peptide could be used as an elegant tool in DC based immunotherapy for unwanted cellular immune responses.",

        "Abstract": "Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) induces cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) expression in many of its cellular targets resulting in production and release of prostaglandins. Although IL-1beta-induced Cox-2 expression most likely requires activation of nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NFkappaB) pathway, this has never been formally demonstrated in vivo. We tested this using a specific inhibitor of NFkappaB activation, the NEMO binding domain (NBD) peptide, that has been shown previously to be effective in various in vivo models of acute inflammation. Incubation of rat glioma cells with the NBD peptide blocked IL-1beta-induced NFkappaB nuclear translocation. Furthermore, after injection of a biotinylated version of the NBD peptide into the lateral ventricle of the brain, we found that it readily diffused to its potential cellular targets in vivo. To test the effects of the peptide on NFkappaB activation and Cox-2 expression in the brain, we injected it intracerebroventricularly (36 microg/rat) into rats before intraperitoneal injection of IL-1beta (60 microg/kg). Treatment with NBD peptide completely abolished IL-1beta-induced NFkappaB activation and Cox-2 synthesis in microvasculature. In contrast, the peptide had no effect on constitutive neuronal Cox-2. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that IL-1beta-induced NFkappaB activation plays a major role in transmission of immune signals from the periphery to the brain.",

        "Abstract": "The transcription factor NF-kappaB has been the focus of intense investigation for nearly two decades. Over this period, considerable progress has been made in determining the function and regulation of NF-kappaB, although there are nuances in this important signaling pathway that still remain to be understood. The challenge now is to reconcile the regulatory complexity in this pathway with the complexity of responses in which NF-kappaB family members play important roles. In this review, we provide an overview of established NF-kappaB signaling pathways with focus on the current state of research into the mechanisms that regulate IKK activation and NF-kappaB transcriptional activity.",

        "Title": "A novel ubiquitin-like domain in IkappaB kinase beta is required for functional activity of the kinase.",
        "Abstract": "Activation of NF-kappaB requires two highly related kinases named IKKalpha and IKKbeta that share identity in the nature and positioning of their structural domains. Despite their similarity, the kinases are functionally divergent, and we therefore sought to identify any structural features specific for IKKalpha or IKKbeta. We performed bioinformatics analysis, and we identified a region resembling a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) that exists only in IKKbeta and that we named the UBL-like domain (ULD). Deletion of the ULD rendered IKKbeta catalytically inactive and unable to induce NF-kappaB activity, and overexpression of only the ULD dose-dependently inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activity. The ULD could not be functionally replaced within IKKbeta by ubiquitin or the corresponding region of IKKalpha, whereas deletion of the equivalent section of IKKalpha did not affect its catalytic activity against IkappaBalpha or its activation by NF-kappaB-inducing kinase. We identified five residues conserved among the larger family of UBL-containing proteins and IKKbeta, and alanine scanning revealed that the leucine at position 353 (Leu(353)) is absolutely critical for IKKbeta-induced NF-kappaB activation. Most intriguingly, the L353A mutant was catalytically active but, unlike wild-type IKKbeta, formed a stable complex with the NF-kappaB p65 subunit. Our findings therefore establish the ULD as a critical functional domain specific for IKKbeta that might play a role in dissociating IKKbeta from p65.",

        "Abstract": "It has been shown previously that the transcription factor NF-kappaB and its inhibitor IkappaBalpha shuttle constitutively between cytosol and nucleus. Moreover, we have recently demonstrated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the NF-kappaB-inducing kinase NIK, a component of the NF-kappaB pathway, which is essential for lymph node development and B-cell function. Here we show that nuclear NIK also occurs in nucleoli and that this localization is mediated by a stretch of basic amino acids in the N-terminal part of the protein (R(143)-K-K-R-K-K-K(149)). This motif is necessary and sufficient for nucleolar localization of NIK, as judged by nuclear localization of mutant versions of the full-length protein and the fact that coupling of these seven amino acids to GFP also leads to accumulation in nucleoli. Using fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) approaches, we demonstrate a dynamic distribution between nucleoli and nucleoplasm and a high mobility of NIK in both compartments. Together with the nuclear export signal in the C-terminal portion of NIK that we have also characterized in detail, the nuclear/nucleolar targeting signals of NIK mediate dynamic circulation of the protein between the cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic and nucleolar compartments. We demonstrate that nuclear NIK is capable of activating NF-kappaB and that this effect is diminished by nucleolar localization. Thus, subcellular distribution of NIK to different compartments might be a means of regulating the function of this kinase.",

        "Abstract": "It has been shown that peptides corresponding to the NF-kappaB essential modifier-binding domain (NBD) of IkappaB kinase alpha or IkappaB kinase beta specifically inhibit the induction of NF-kappaB activation without inhibiting the basal NF-kappaB activity. The present study demonstrates the effectiveness of NBD peptides in inhibiting the disease process in adoptively transferred experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Clinical symptoms of EAE were much lower in mice receiving wild-type (wt)NBD peptides compared with those receiving mutated (m)NBD peptides. Histological and immunocytochemical analysis showed that wtNBD peptides inhibited EAE-induced spinal cord mononuclear cell invasion and normalized p65 (the RelA subunit of NF-kappaB) expression within the spinal cord. Analysis of lymph node cells isolated from donor and recipient mice showed that wtNBD peptides but not mNBD peptides were able to shift the immune response from a Th1 to a Th2 profile. Consistently, wtNBD peptides but not mNBD peptides inhibited the encephalitogenicity of myelin basic protein-specific T cells. Furthermore, i.p. injection of wtNBD peptides but not mNBD peptides was also able to reduce LPS- and IFN-gamma-induced expression of inducible NO synthase, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha in vivo in the cerebellum. Taken together, our results support the conclusion that NBD peptides are antineuroinflammatory, and that NBD peptides may have therapeutic effect in neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis.",

        "Title": "NF-kappa B activation in human breast cancer specimens and its role in cell proliferation and apoptosis.",
        "Abstract": "Lack of molecular targets in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-negative) breast cancer is a major therapeutic hurdle. We studied NF-kappa B activation in human breast tumors and in carcinoma cell lines. Activated NF-kappa B was detected predominantly in ER-negative vs. ER-positive breast tumors and mostly in ER-negative and ErbB2-positive tumors (86%). These in vivo results demonstrate association of activated NF-kappa B with a subgroup of human breast tumors and are consistent with previously reported in vitro observations using similar classes of human breast cancer cell lines. Finding such an association suggested functional and biological significance. Immunofluorescence demonstrated increased nuclear p65, a component of the active NF-kappa B complex, in cytokeratin 19 (CK19)-positive epithelial cells of ER-negative/ErbB2-positive tumor samples. In contrast, nuclear NF-kappa B was detected mostly in stroma of ER-negative and ErbB2-negative tumors, suggesting a role of activated NF-kappa B in intercellular signaling between epithelial and stromal cells in this type of breast cancers. To elucidate roles of activated NF-kappa B, we used an ER-negative and ErbB2-positive human breast tumor cell line (SKBr3). The polypeptide heregulin beta1 stimulated, and herceptin, the anti-ErbB2 antibody, inhibited, NF-kappa B activation in SKBr3 cells. The NF-kappa B essential modulator (NEMO)-binding domain (NBD) peptide, an established selective inhibitor of I kappa B-kinase (IKK), blocked heregulin-mediated activation of NF-kappa B and cell proliferation, and simultaneously induced apoptosis only in proliferating and not resting cells. These results substantiate the hypothesis that certain breast cancer cells rely on NF-kappa B for aberrant cell proliferation and simultaneously avoid apoptosis, thus implicating activated NF-kappa B as a therapeutic target for distinctive subclasses of ER-negative breast cancers.",

        "Abstract": "Bone destruction is a pathological hallmark of several chronic inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis. Inflammation-induced bone loss of this sort results from elevated numbers of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Gene targeting studies have shown that the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) has a crucial role in osteoclast differentiation, and blocking NF-kappa B is a potential strategy for preventing inflammatory bone resorption. We tested this approach using a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of the I kappa B-kinase complex, a crucial component of signal transduction pathways to NF-kappa B. The peptide inhibited RANKL-stimulated NF-kappa B activation and osteoclastogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, this peptide significantly reduced the severity of collagen-induced arthritis in mice by reducing levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta, abrogating joint swelling and reducing destruction of bone and cartilage. Therefore, selective inhibition of NF-kappa B activation offers an effective therapeutic approach for inhibiting chronic inflammatory diseases involving bone resorption.",

Here we report the cloning and characterization of a member of the mammalian TLR family, TLR11, that displays a distinct pattern of expression in macrophages and liver, kidney, and bladder epithelial cells. Cells expressing TLR11 fail to respond to known TLR ligands but instead respond specifically to uropathogenic bacteria. Mice lacking TLR11 are highly susceptible to infection of the kidneys by uropathogenic bacteria, indicating a potentially important role for TLR11 in preventing infection of internal organs of the urogenital system.",

        "Abstract": "The application of anti-inflammatory therapies began thousands of years ago with the use of readily available natural resources. It is only recently, however, that the cellular and molecular mechanisms of inflammation have been appreciated sufficiently to design anti-inflammatory strategies with limited side effects. For example, salicylates and glucocorticoids, two widely used anti-inflammatory drug classes, are now known to inhibit the activation of NF-kappa B, a transcription factor that regulates the inducible expression of a wide range of proinflammatory mediators. New generations of NF-kappa B-targeting anti-inflammatory agents that are specific, efficacious, and cost-effective may therefore complement or replace current therapies. In this review, we describe various classes of NF-kappa B inhibitors and discuss important unresolved issues regarding their use.",

        "Title": "Ecsit is required for Bmp signaling and mesoderm formation during mouse embryogenesis.",
        "Abstract": "Bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps) are members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) superfamily that play critical roles during mouse embryogenesis. Signaling by Bmp receptors is mediated mainly by Smad proteins. In this study, we show that a targeted null mutation of Ecsit, encoding a signaling intermediate of the Toll pathway, leads to reduced cell proliferation, altered epiblast patterning, impairment of mesoderm formation, and embryonic lethality at embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5), phenotypes that mimic the Bmp receptor type1a (Bmpr1a) null mutant. In addition, specific Bmp target gene expression is abolished in the absence of Ecsit. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that Ecsit associates constitutively with Smad4 and associates with Smad1 in a Bmp-inducible manner. Together with Smad1 and Smad4, Ecsit binds to the promoter of specific Bmp target genes. Finally, knock-down of Ecsit with Ecsit-specific short hairpin RNA inhibits both Bmp and Toll signaling. Therefore, these results show that Ecsit functions as an essential component in two important signal transduction pathways and establishes a novel role for Ecsit as a cofactor for Smad proteins in the Bmp signaling pathway.",

        "Title": "Tumor necrosis factor-alpha induces nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent TRPC1 expression in endothelial cells.",
        "Abstract": "We investigated the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in activating the store-operated Ca2+ channels in endothelial cells via the expression of transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) isoforms. We observed that TNF-alpha exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells resulted in TRPC1 mRNA and protein expression, whereas it had no effect on TRPC3, TRPC4, or TRPC5 expression. The TRPC1 expression was associated with increased Ca2+ influx after intracellular Ca2+ store depletion with either thrombin or thapsigargin. We cloned the 5'-regulatory region of the human TRPC1 (hTRPC1) gene which contained a TATA box and CCAAT sequence close to the transcription initiation site. We also identified four nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-binding sites in the 5'-regulatory region. To address the contribution of NF-kappaB in the mechanism of TRPC1 expression, we determined the effects of TNF-alpha on expression of the reporter luciferase after transfection of hTRPC1 promoter-luciferase (hTRPC1-Pro-Luc) construct in the human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line. Reporter activity increased >4-fold at 4 h after TNF-alpha challenge. TNF-alpha-induced increase in reporter activity was markedly reduced by co-expression of either kinase-defective IKKbeta kinase mutant or non-phosphorylatable IkappaB mutant. Treatment with NEMO-binding domain peptide, which prevents NF-kappaB activation by selectively inhibiting IKKgamma interaction with IKK complex, also blocked the TNF-alpha-induced TRPC1 expression. Thus, TNF-alpha induces TRPC1 expression through an NF-kappaB-dependent pathway in endothelial cells, which can trigger augmented Ca2+ entry following Ca2+ store depletion. The augmented Ca2+ entry secondary to TRPC1 expression may be an important mechanism of endothelial injury induced by TNF-alpha.",

We report that genetic inactivation of the MAGUK family protein CARD11/Carma1/Bimp3 results in a complete block in T and B cell immunity. CARD11 is essential for antigen receptor- and PKC-mediated proliferation and cytokine production in T and B cells due to a selective defect in JNK and NFkappaB activation. Moreover, B cell proliferation and JNK activation were impaired upon stimulation of TLR4 with lipopolysaccharide, indicating that CARD11 is involved in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Our results show that the same family of molecules are critical regulators of neuronal synapses and immune receptor signaling.",

        "Title": "Differential phosphorylation of the signal-responsive domain of I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta by I kappa B kinases.",
        "Abstract": "NF-kappa B activity is regulated by its association with the inhibitory I kappa B proteins, among which I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta are the most abundant. I kappa B proteins are widely expressed in different cells and tissues and bind to similar combinations of NF-kappa B proteins. The degradation of I kappa B proteins allows nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B and hence plays a critical role in NF-kappa B activation. Previous studies have demonstrated that, although both I kappa B proteins are phosphorylated by the same I kappa B kinase (IKK) complex, and their ubiquitination and degradation following phosphorylation are carried out by the same ubiquitination/degradation machinery, their kinetics of degradation are quite different. To better understand the underlying mechanism of the differences in degradation kinetics, we have carried out a systematic, comparative analysis of the ability of the IKK catalytic subunits to phosphorylate I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta. We found that, whereas IKK alpha is a weak kinase for the N-terminal serines of both I kappa B isoforms, IKK beta is an efficient kinase for those residues in I kappa B alpha. However, IKK beta phosphorylates the N-terminal serines of I kappa B beta far less efficiently, thereby providing an explanation for the slower rate of degradation observed for I kappa B beta. Mutational analysis indicated that the regions around the two N-terminal serines collectively influence the relative phosphorylation efficiency, and no individual residue is critical. These findings provide the first systematic analysis of the ability of I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta to serve as substrates for IKKs and help provide a possible explanation for the differential degradation kinetics of I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta.",

        "Abstract": "We report the crystal structure of a murine IkappaBbeta x NF-kappaB p65 homodimer complex. Crystallographic models were determined for two triclinic crystalline systems and refined against data at 2.5 and 2.1 A. The overall complex structure is similar to that of the IkappaBalpha.NF-kappaB p50/p65 heterodimer complex. One NF-kappaB p65 subunit nuclear localization signal clearly contacts IkappaBbeta, whereas a homologous segment from the second subunit of the homodimer is mostly solvent-exposed. The unique 47-amino acid insertion between ankyrin repeats three and four of IkappaBbeta is mostly disordered in the structure. Primary sequence analysis and differences in the mode of binding at the IkappaBbeta sixth ankyrin repeat and NF-kappaB p65 homodimer suggest a model for nuclear IkappaBbeta.NF-kappaB.DNA ternary complex formation. These unique structural features of IkappaBbeta may contribute to its ability to mediate persistent NF-kappaB activation.",

        "Abstract": "p202a is a member of the interferon-inducible murine p200 family of proteins. These proteins share 1 or 2 partially conserved 200 amino acid segments of the a or the b type. The known biological activities of p202a include among others the regulation of muscle differentiation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. These biological activities of p202a can be correlated with the inhibition of the activity of several transcription factors. Thus, the binding of p202a results in the inhibition of the sequence-specific binding to DNA of the c-Fos, c-Jun, E2F1, E2F4, MyoD, myogenin, and c-Myc transcription factors. This study concerns the mechanisms by which p202a inhibits the activity of NF-kappaB, a transcription factor involved among others in host defense, inflammation, immunity, and the apoptotic response. NF-kappaB consists of p50 and p65 subunits. We demonstrate that p202a can inhibit in vitro and in vivo the binding to DNA of p65 homodimers and p50/65 heterodimers, whereas it increases the binding of p50 homodimers. Thus p202a can impair NF-kappaB activity both by inhibiting the binding to DNA of the transcriptionally active p65 homodimers and p50/p65 heterodimers and by boosting the binding of the repressive p50 homodimers. p202a can bind p50 and p65 in vitro and in vivo, and p202a can be part of the p50 homodimer complex bound to DNA. p50 binds in p202a to the a type segment, whereas p65 binds to the b type segment. Transfected ectopic p202a increases the apoptotic effect of tumor necrosis factor (at least in part) by inhibiting NF-kappaB and its antiapoptotic activity.",

        "Title": "RelB forms transcriptionally inactive complexes with RelA/p65.",
        "Abstract": "RelB is an unusual member of the NF-kappaB transcription factor family that acts as both a transcriptional activator as well as a repressor of NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression. Although RelB promotes gene expression when it associates with p50/NF-kappaB1 or p52/NF-kappaB2, the precise molecular mechanisms through which it represses NF-kappaB remain unclear. To examine this inhibitory function in more detail, we employed reporter gene assays and found that RelB represses at the level of RelA. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis revealed that in vitro translated RelB impaired the DNA binding activity of RelA and that overexpressed RelB significantly reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced RelA activity in murine embryonic fibroblasts. Intriguingly, this inhibitory effect was due to the formation of RelA.RelB heterodimers that were unable to bind to kappaB sites in vitro strongly suggesting that these newly described NF-kappaB dimers cannot bind DNA. Expression pattern analysis revealed that RelA.RelB heterodimers appeared at relatively low levels in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. However, the presence of these complexes increased following stimulation with phorbolesters or lipopolysaccharide or by overexpression of constitutively active IKKbeta. Functional characterization of RelA.RelB heterodimers in NIH3T3 murine embryonic fibroblasts revealed that they are not regulated by IkappaB proteins and are located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that sequestration of RelA in transcriptionally inactive RelA.RelB complexes provides a molecular mechanism that may explain the repressive role of RelB on NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression.",

Both IkappaBs bind to the same NF-kappaB dimers and are widely expressed in different cells and tissues. To better understand how these two IkappaB isoforms differ biologically, we have characterized the expression of IkappaBbeta in testis, a tissue in which IkappaBalpha is only minimally expressed. We have found that IkappaBbeta expression is localized within the haploid spermatid stages of spermatogenesis and follows the expression of nuclear NF-kappaB. IkappaBbeta expression in haploid spermatids is likely regulated by Sox family proteins, members of which are also expressed within spermatids. We have shown that both SRY and Sox-5 can bind to multiple Sox binding sites found within the IkappaBbeta promoter and can enhance transcription of a reporter gene in transient transfection assays. We also demonstrate that IkappaBbeta mRNA is strongly expressed in developing male gonads. These results therefore suggest that IkappaBbeta may be a novel target for transcription factors of the HMG-box SRY/Sox family and imply a potential role for NF-kappaB/IkappaBbeta in spermatogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Proinflammatory activation of NF-kappaB requires an upstream kinase complex (IkappaB-kinase; IKK) composed of two catalytic subunits (IKKalpha and IKKbeta) and a noncatalytic regulatory component named NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator). NEMO interacts with a COOH-terminal sequence within both IKKs termed the NEMO-binding domain (NBD), and a cell-permeable NBD peptide blocks NEMO/IKKbeta interactions and inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF-kappaB. We report here that a peptide encompassing the NBD not only blocked association of both IKKs with NEMO but also disrupted preformed NEMO/IKK complexes in vitro. Furthermore, peptide blocking and alanine-scanning mutation studies revealed differences between the NBDs of IKKalpha and IKKbeta, and mutational analysis of the IKKbeta NBD identified the physical properties required at each position to maintain association with NEMO. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of NEMO-binding by IKKbeta through deletion of the NBD renders it catalytically active and that potential phosphorylation within the IKKbeta NBD may serve as a signal to down-regulate IKK activity. Our findings therefore provide critical insight into the physical properties of the NBD that will be valuable for the design of drugs aimed at disrupting the IKK complex and also reveal potential regulatory mechanisms controlling the function of the IKK complex.",

        "Title": "CD8+ T cell apoptosis induced by Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit occurs via a novel pathway involving NF-kappaB-dependent caspase activation.",
        "Abstract": "The B subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (EtxB) is a potent immunomodulatory molecule capable of treating and preventing autoimmune disease. These properties result from its ability to bind to glycolipid receptors, principally G(M1) ganglioside, and modulate immune cell function. EtxB receptor binding causes B cell activation, modulates monocyte cytokine secretion and triggers apoptosis of CD8+ T cells. These wide-ranging effects suggest that B subunit receptor interaction triggers signaling events affecting cellular differentiation. We have investigated the processes by which EtxB induces CD8+ T cell apoptosis. We show that receptor interaction by EtxB activates caspase-3 in CD8+ but not in CD4+ T cells. Inhibition of caspase-3 blocks the apoptotic process. EtxB induces the activation of NF-kappaB in both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The findings that (i) SN50, a peptide inhibitor of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, prevents caspase-3 activation and subsequent apoptosis, and (ii) CD8+CD4- thymocytes from transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative form of the IkappaBalpha protein were markedly less susceptible to EtxB-induced apoptosis than cells from wild-type mice, indicate that NF-kappaB is important in the induction of the apoptotic pathway. Further investigations revealed that while caspase-8 activity is detected concomitant to caspase-3, caspase-9 activation, following mitochondrial cytochrome c release, is detectable later on. These observations are consistent with death receptor-mediated signaling, however, experiments using lpr/lpr and p55 TNFR -/- mice rule out the involvement of Fas and the p55 TNF receptor, respectively. The data therefore indicate that EtxB-mediated apoptosis occurs via a novel pathway involving NF-kappaB.",

        "Abstract": "Homodimers of the NF-kappa B p50 subunit are transcriptionally repressive in cells, whereas they can promote transcription in vitro, suggesting that their endogenous effects are mediated by association with other factors. We now demonstrate that transcriptionally inactive nuclear NF-kappaB in resting cells consists of homodimers of either p65 or p50 complexed with the histone deacetylase HDAC-1. Only the p50-HDAC-1 complexes bind to DNA and suppress NF-kappa B-dependent gene expression in unstimulated cells. Appropriate stimulation causes nuclear localization of NF-kappa B complexes containing phosphorylated p65 that associates with CBP and displaces the p50-HDAC-1 complexes. Our results demonstrate that phosphorylation of p65 determines whether it associates with either CBP or HDAC-1, ensuring that only p65 entering the nucleus from cytoplasmic NF-kappa B:Ikappa B complexes can activate transcription.",

        "Abstract": "E2A and HEB are basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors essential for T cell development. Complete inhibition of their activities through transgenic overexpression of their inhibitors Id1 and Tal1 leads to a dramatic loss of thymocytes. Here, we suggest that bHLH proteins play important roles in establishing thresholds for pre-TCR and TCR signaling. Inhibition of their function allows double-negative cells to differentiate without a functional pre-TCR, while anti-CD3 stimulation downregulates bHLH activities. We also find that the transcription factor NF-kappaB becomes activated in transgenic thymocytes. Further activation of NF-kappaB exacerbates the loss of thymocytes, whereas inhibition of NF-kappaB leads to the rescue of double-positive thymocytes. Therefore, we propose that E2A and HEB negatively regulate pre-TCR and TCR signaling and their removal causes hyperactivation and apoptosis of thymocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated recognition of pathogens represents one of the most important mechanisms of innate immunity and disease resistance. The adaptor protein Tollip was identified initially as an intermediate in interleukin (IL)-1 signaling. Here we report that Tollip also associates directly with TLR2 and TLR4 and plays an inhibitory role in TLR-mediated cell activation. Inhibition by Tollip is mediated through its ability to potently suppress the activity of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) after TLR activation. In addition, we show for the first time that Tollip is a bona fide substrate for IRAK and is phosphorylated by IRAK upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide or IL-1. Negative regulation of TLR signaling by Tollip may therefore serve to limit the production of proinflammatory mediators during inflammation and infection.",
