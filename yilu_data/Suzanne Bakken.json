As a complement to didactic content, the students address a research question of their choice using a big data source, Jupyter Notebook, and R programming language. The course evolved over time with generative AI tools being added in 2023. Student self-evaluations of their data science competencies improved from baseline. This case study adds to the evolving body of literature on data science and AI competences in nursing.",

        "Abstract": "Research on polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for common, genetically complex chronic diseases aims to improve health-related predictions, tailor risk-reducing interventions, and improve health outcomes. Yet, the study and use of PRSs in clinical settings raise equity, clinical, and regulatory challenges that can be greater for individuals from historically marginalized racial, ethnic, and other minoritized communities. As part of the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics IV Network, we conducted online focus groups with patients/community members, clinicians, and members of institutional review boards to explore their views on key issues, including PRS research, return of PRS results, clinical translation, and barriers and facilitators to health behavioral changes in response to PRS results. Across stakeholder groups, our findings indicate support for PRS development and a strong interest in having PRS results returned to research participants. However, we also found multi-level barriers and significant differences in stakeholders' views about what is needed and possible for successful implementation. These include researcher-participant interaction formats, health and genomic literacy, and a range of structural barriers, such as financial instability, insurance coverage, and the absence of health-supporting infrastructure and affordable healthy food options in poorer neighborhoods. Our findings highlight the need to revisit and implement measures in PRS studies (e.g., incentives and resources for follow-up care), as well as system-level policies to promote equity in genomic research and health outcomes.",

Using scalable open-source methods, we conducted a computational scoping review of more than 200,000 articles to investigate major populations, conditions, and themes as well as notable gaps. We also compared trends in studied conditions to their relative prevalence using insurance claims (42 million Americans). HDMH publications represent 1% of articles in Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE). Most studies are observational in nature, although randomized trial reporting has increased fivefold in the past 20 years. Half of HDMH articles concentrate on only three disease groups (cancer, mental health, and endocrine/metabolic disorders), while hearing, vision, and skin-related conditions are among the least well represented despite substantial prevalence. To support further investigation, we present HDMH Monitor, an interactive dashboard and repository generated from the HDMH bibliome.",

Incongruencies in communication styles between patients with limited English proficiency (LEP), interpreters, and providers contribute to significant disparities in pain care and outcomes. This study's purpose is to evaluate and refine a culturally appropriate InfoViz pain quality assessment tool for LEP Hmong patients. We conducted a three-part iterative user-centered study with LEP Hmong, bilingual Hmong, and Hmong interpreters with (1) participatory design sessions to evaluate and refine pain infographics for inclusion on the tool, (2) card-sorting to organize the infographics to match the mental models of LEP patients, and (3) a tool assessment to identify which tool accurately represented LEP patients' mental models and was preferred in clinical settings. Fifty-five participants provided three common themes for pain infographics refinement: culturally-relevant colors, infographics resembling human anatomy, and action-specific squiggle lines. The card-sorting sessions revealed three organizational themes: sensation (",

        "Abstract": "The Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish (hereafter, \"Hispanic\") populations in the U.S. bear a disproportionate burden of COVID-19-related outcomes, including disease incidence and mortality. Developing culturally appropriate national public health services for Hispanic persons remains a challenge. This study examined the association of heritage and language preference with COVID-19 testing (tested vs. not tested) and vaccination (vaccinated vs. not vaccinated) outcomes among Hispanic participants from 18 Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics-Underserved Populations (RADx-UP) projects (n\u00a0=\u00a03308; mean age\u00a0=\u00a044.1\u00a0years [SD\u00a0=\u00a014.9], 60% women; 83% spoke other than English at home). Generalized estimating equation models adjusted for age, gender, education level, income, insurance coverage, geographic region, comorbidities, and prior infection. Relative to Mexican heritage, individuals identifying as Puerto Rican or Dominican were more likely to test for COVID-19, and South American heritage was associated with higher testing and vaccination rates. Speaking Spanish or another language at home was associated with increased testing compared with speaking English at home for individuals who preferred not to report their heritage, and increased vaccination for those with Mexican, Cuban, or Central American heritage. This study highlights heterogeneity in testing and vaccination behaviors among Hispanic populations based on heritage and language preference, underscoring the diversity within the U.S. Hispanic community. In contrast to other studies on linguistic acculturation and health care utilization, our study found that a language other than English spoken at home was associated with greater vaccine uptake. That is, enculturation - the retention of Spanish language and presumably of Hispanic cultural norms - was linked with being vaccinated.",

        "Abstract": "Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence strategies for HIV+\u2009adolescents and young adults (AYA) are needed to prevent HIV-related morbidity, mortality, and onward transmission. In the Adherence Connection for Counseling, Education, and Support (ACCESS) pilot, an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design was used to develop and test a peer-led, mobile health (mHealth) cognitive behavioral ART adherence intervention. HIV+\u2009AYA (ages 16-29\u00a0years) with unsuppressed plasma HIV RNA (HIV viral load) were eligible for this five-session intervention directed to improving ART adherence and HIV viral load. A total of 78 peer-led remote videoconferencing sessions (via WebEx) were delivered to 16 participants. High completion rates (97.5%) and client satisfaction scores (mean\u2009=\u200929.13 of 32; SD\u2009=\u20092.45) were observed. Self-reported ART adherence improved (32% increase in doses taken; 95th CI\u200911.2-53.3) with an annualized average rate of 47.5% (0.28 log",

        "Abstract": "The Future of Nursing 2020 to 2030 report explicitly addresses the need for integration of nursing expertise in designing, generating, analyzing, and applying data to support initiatives focused on social determinants of health (SDOH) and health equity. The metrics necessary to enable and evaluate progress on all recommendations require harnessing existing data sources and developing new ones, as well as transforming and integrating data into information systems to facilitate communication, information sharing, and decision making among the key stakeholders. We examine the recommendations of the 2021 report through an interdisciplinary lens that integrates nursing, biomedical informatics, and data science by addressing three critical questions: (a) what data are needed?, (b) what infrastructure and processes are needed to transform data into information?, and (c) what information systems are needed to \"level up\" nurse-led interventions from the micro-level to the meso- and macro-levels to address social determinants of health and advance health equity?",

        "Abstract": "The use of electronic health (eHealth) tools has the potential to support the overall health, wellness, fitness status, and ability to deploy worldwide of active duty service members (SMs). Additionally, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic forced healthcare organizations to quickly convert to virtual care settings to decrease face-to-face interactions and increase access to healthcare using technology. The shift to virtual care and the push to increase use of eHealth tools heightened the need to understand how military members interact with eHealth tools. Little is known about the factors that influence SMs use of eHealth tools and if having a health condition increases or decreases use. To evaluate these factors, we completed a cross-sectional, retrospective analysis on a sample of 198,388 active duty SMs aged 18 to 68\u2009years.",

        "Abstract": "Explanatory models describe individuals' perceptions of their illness experiences, which can guide culturally relevant care. We constructed an explanatory model of the experience of living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the Dominican Republic. Following qualitative descriptive methodology, we conducted interviews in Spanish using a semi-structured interview guide developed using Kleinman's explanatory model framework. Two bilingual researchers coded interview transcripts following conventional content analysis. We used deductive codes from Kleinman's framework and inductive codes external to the framework to construct the codebook. We arranged codes by shared meaning into categories and constructed themes that reflected shared findings from inductive categories and deductive codes. Twenty-six persons living with HIV participated. They provided rich descriptions of their experiences represented by four cross-cutting themes, which informed the explanatory model. By incorporating this in-depth understanding of patients' illness experiences into care delivery, nurses can cultivate culturally meaningful and trusting patient-centered partnerships that improve health.",

        "Abstract": "Data-driven characterization of symptom clusters in chronic conditions is essential for shared cluster detection and physiological mechanism discovery. This study aims to computationally describe symptom documentation from electronic nursing notes and compare symptom clusters among patients diagnosed with four chronic conditions-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cancer. Nursing notes (N\u2009=\u2009504,395; 133,977 patients) were obtained for the 2016 calendar year from a single medical center. We used NimbleMiner, a natural language processing application, to identify the presence of 56 symptoms. We calculated symptom documentation prevalence by note and patient for the corpus. Then, we visually compared documentation for a subset of patients (N\u2009=\u200922,657) diagnosed with COPD (n\u2009=\u20093339), heart failure (n\u2009=\u20096587), diabetes (n\u2009=\u200912,139), and cancer (n\u2009=\u20097269) and conducted multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering to discover underlying groups of patients who have similar symptom profiles (i.e., symptom clusters) for each condition. As expected, pain was the most frequently documented symptom. All conditions had a group of patients characterized by no symptoms. Shared clusters included cardiovascular symptoms for heart failure and diabetes; pain and other symptoms for COPD, diabetes, and cancer; and a newly-identified cognitive and neurological symptom cluster for heart failure, diabetes, and cancer. Cancer (gastrointestinal symptoms and fatigue) and COPD (mental health symptoms) each contained a unique cluster. In summary, we report both shared and distinct, as well as established and novel, symptom clusters across chronic conditions. Findings support the use of electronic health record-derived notes and NLP methods to study symptoms and symptom clusters to advance symptom science.",

        "Abstract": "We designed an infographic intervention to help clinicians provide health information to persons living with HIV. In this study, we assessed the extent to which our intervention may improve objectively and subjectively measured health outcomes (CD4 count, viral load, and engagement with clinician among others) when integrated into routine visits in the Dominican Republic. In this pretest-posttest study, we followed participants for 9\u00a0months at 3-month intervals. Physicians administered the intervention during participants' first 3 visits. Outcome measures, selected using a conceptual model, were assessed at 4 time points. We assessed changes in outcomes over time with general linear regressions and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests. Participants (N\u2009=\u200950) were mostly female (56%) and had been living with HIV for a mean of 6.3\u00a0years (SD\u2009=\u20096.1). All outcomes, except CD4 count, demonstrated statistically significant improvements by study end. This provides preliminary evidence our intervention may improve outcomes, but further testing is needed.",

        "Abstract": "In chronic conditions, patients and providers need support in understanding and managing illness over time. Focusing on endometriosis, an enigmatic chronic condition, we conducted interviews with specialists and focus groups with patients to elicit their work in care specifically pertaining to dealing with an enigmatic disease, both independently and in partnership, and how technology could support these efforts. We found that the work to care for the illness, including reflecting on the illness experience and planning for care, is significantly compounded by the complex nature of the disease: enigmatic condition means uncertainty and frustration in care and management; the multi-factorial and systemic features of endometriosis without any guidance to interpret them overwhelm patients and providers; the different temporal resolutions of this chronic condition confuse both patients and provides; and patients and providers negotiate medical knowledge and expertise in an attempt to align their perspectives. We note how this added complexity demands that patients and providers work together to find common ground and align perspectives, and propose three design opportunities (considerations to construct a holistic picture of the patient, design features to reflect and make sense of the illness, and opportunities and mechanisms to correct misalignments and plan for care) and implications to support patients and providers in their care work. Specifically, the enigmatic nature of endometriosis necessitates complementary approaches from human-centered computing and artificial intelligence, and thus opens a number of future research avenues.",

        "Abstract": "How clinicians utilize medically actionable genomic information, displayed in the electronic health record (EHR), in medical decision-making remains unknown. Participating sites of the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network have invested resources into EHR integration efforts to enable the display of genetic testing data across heterogeneous EHR systems. To assess clinicians' engagement with unsolicited EHR-integrated genetic test results of eMERGE participants within a large tertiary care academic medical center, we analyzed automatically generated EHR access log data. We found that clinicians viewed only 1% of all the eMERGE genetic test results integrated in the EHR. Using a cluster analysis, we also identified different user traits associated with varying degrees of engagement with the EHR-integrated genomic data. These data contribute important empirical knowledge about clinicians limited and brief engagements with unsolicited EHR-integrated genetic test results of eMERGE participants. Appreciation for user-specific roles provide additional context for why certain users were more or less engaged with the unsolicited results. This study highlights opportunities to use EHR log data as a performance metric to more precisely inform ongoing EHR-integration efforts and decisions about the allocation of informatics resources in genomic research.",

In response, we developed an infographic intervention to enhance clinical, HIV-related communication. This study reports on its feasibility and acceptability at a clinical setting in the Dominican Republic. We conducted in-depth interviews with physicians who administered the intervention and patients who received it. We conducted audio-recorded interviews in Spanish using semi-structured interview guides. Recordings were professionally transcribed verbatim then analyzed using descriptive content analysis. Physician transcripts were deductively coded according to constructs of Bowen et al.'s feasibility framework and patient transcripts were inductively coded. Three physicians and 26 patients participated. Feasibility constructs endorsed by physicians indicated that infographics were easy to use, improved teaching, and could easily be incorporated into their workflow. Coding of patient transcripts identified four categories that indicated the intervention was acceptable and useful, offered feedback regarding effective clinical communication, and recommended improvements to infographics. Taken together, these data indicate our intervention was a feasible and acceptable way to provide clinical, HIV-related information and provide important recommendations for future visualization design as well as effective clinical communication with similar patient populations.",

        "Abstract": "Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) using the da Vinci Surgical system was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2009. Currently, most available safety information on TORS procedures describes adverse events occurring in the context of clinical trials or series at high-volume academic centers. The goal of this study was to catalog reported adverse events associated with the da Vinci device in head and neck procedures by querying an FDA database. A search was performed on the MAUDE database inspecting for TORS safety incident reports generated from January 2009 through May 2020 using key words \"da Vinci\" and \"Intuitive Surgical\". A total of 3312 medical device records were produced. Of these 36 head and neck adverse events, reports were identified through manual screening of the data by the authors. Death was found to be the most common adverse event reported overall, manifesting in 44% of all reported incidents. The most frequent source of mortality was found to be hemorrhaging in the perioperative period rather than incidents of device malfunction or structural damage from surgery. This was found to be similar to the results of other published series for transoral ablative surgery. This study suggests that the small number of reported adverse events related to TORS with the da Vinci system seems to mirror what would be expected from the same procedures using other methods for transoral surgery.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the VIP-HANA application (app) for improving symptom burden in a randomized control trial of 100 people living with HIV (PLWH) who have non-AIDS conditions associated with HIV. The intervention group received the VIP-HANA app which allowed them to report their symptoms every week and receive self-management strategies tailored to their symptoms. The control arm received an app to report their symptoms every week but did not receive any strategies. The results of our study suggest that symptom burden improved in the participants of both study arms. Although these findings do not support the efficacy of VIP-HANA in improving symptom burden in PLWH who have HIV-associated non-AIDS (HANA) conditions, this could be a function of the study design. Findings suggest that PLWH are interested in monitoring their symptoms, which could have implications for the wider use of digital health for patient surveillance.",

        "Abstract": "With the broader introduction of genomic medicine in research and clinical care, an increasing number of persons are offered genetic testing. Many factors, including genetic literacy, may impact the utilization of genetic results by patients and their families. We developed a rapid, self-administered measure of genetic literacy, called Genetic Literacy Fast Test (GeneLiFT). We next evaluated the association of GeneLiFT scores with the comprehension of limitations of genomic medicine in participants undergoing genetic testing in the NIH-sponsored eMERGE III study at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York. All participants underwent genetic screening for variants in 74 actionable genes associated with adult-onset disorders. A diverse cohort of 724 participants completed the survey (60% women, 45% less than 40\u00a0years old, and 53% self-reported White non-Hispanic ancestry). The GeneLiFT was validated using known group differences based on education, health literacy, and numeracy, and with questions assessing genetic knowledge. GeneLiFT identified multiple standard genetics terms, that is, jargon, not recognized by more than 50% of participants (including actionability and pathogenicity). Low genetic literacy, identified in 210 participants (29%), was significantly associated with poor understanding of the limitations of genetic testing (p-values\u00a0<\u00a010",

Such diseases require self-management skills as well as medical management. Well-designed visualizations are suitable for visualizing data related to self-management because they can help narrow the comprehension gap between individuals with low and high levels of health literacy by leveraging existing visual analysis skills while reducing the demand on literacy and numeracy competencies. Use of information visualizations also supports a common visual representation across languages to address limited English proficiency. This report illustrates the use of information visualizations for communication related to self-management through research-based case examples and summarizes key lessons from studies with Latinos in New York City.",

Understanding how these platforms are used is critical to guide their effective development and implementation. This study contributes a log-based method to study user engagement with online genomic educational videos among participants in a genomic screening study. We collected baseline demographics, logged participant usage and compared pre- and post-education genomic knowledge. Participants (N=390) who chose website access differed from those who declined access (N=81) and were more likely to be non-Latino, English speaking, younger, and have higher educational attainment. Only 45% who accessed the website viewed at least one video. The average video exposure time was 12 minutes. Longer exposure was not associated with an improvement in the user's genomic knowledge. Our study and future studies of user analytics should be used to guide the development of effective, scalable genomic education methods.",

REDCap lacks randomization and automation functionality, requiring the development of a workaround. A template survey was created containing all vignettes, copied for each survey instance and edited to hide unwanted content. REDCap configuration required three hours for forty-two surveys. The utilized \"copy-and-hide\" workaround was successful, providing quasi-automation and reasonable labor-time. Additional strategies are planned using REDCap's Data Dictionary and other survey software.",

        "Abstract": "The goal of this study was to illustrate the translation of our extant eHealth intervention (VIP) into an mHealth app for persons living with HIV (PLWH) with HIV-Associated non-AIDS (HANA) conditions, a new clinical problem. We integrated different quantitative and qualitative methodologies from different disciplines to accomplish the task of adapting an eHealth system for a new set of clinical problems. Building off of our past development of the VIP website, we used a multi-modal, iterative user-centered design process to develop the VIP-HANA app. Our process was used to better understand the needs of a national sample of PLWH recruited online. Findings from the usability evaluation demonstrate a potentially useful and easy to use app. Integration of multi-modal methodologies from different fields to accomplish the tasks of adaptation and evaluation of a mobile app is an appealing, rigorous and useful approach.",

        "Abstract": "Caregivers of persons with dementia need anticipatory guidance about the stages of dementia in order to prepare for the caregiving situations they will face. The study objective was to develop a set of pictograms representing the functional stages of dementia for eventual inclusion in a tailored, educational web application. We used a hybrid iterative participatory design process. A graphic designer prepared prototypes in a flat, minimalistic style. These were then culled and refined based on feedback from 16 Hispanic caregivers in six design sessions in English and Spanish. The resulting 19 pictograms representing the functional stages and substages of dementia were acceptable to and easily comprehended by participants. Short, plain-language captions support comprehension and aid discrimination between similar scenarios. Our participants preferred candid depictions of all aspects of dementia, including bodily functions, but acceptability may vary by population so further testing is warranted prior to deployment with a new population.",

        "Abstract": "Culturally- and linguistically-tailored health communication is needed for vulnerable populations to manage their health and the health of their families. This presents a significant design challenge. The use of collages is an increasingly popular technique with the flexibility to capture the needs and experiences of individuals with various cultural and language preferences. Collage analysis has typically remained qualitative in nature. We introduce a novel, objective, semi-automated approach that enhances collage analysis to elucidate pattern differences that may not be detectable by natural perception. We present a case scenario of collage analysis based on the expressed experience and self-management needs of Hispanic dementia caregivers (n\u202f=\u202f24). We demonstrate how our innovative approach may reveal cultural differences between language groups that could have otherwise been missed using traditional techniques.",

However, few studies have assessed provider's perceptions of an acute care portal after implementation. In this study, we surveyed 63 nurses, physicians, and physician assistants following a 3-year randomized trial of an acute care portal. The survey assessed providers' perceptions of the portal and its impact on care delivery. Respondents reported that the portal positively impacted care, and they perceived that their patients found it usable and trustworthy. Respondents reported that all the portal's features were useful, especially the display of laboratory test results. Compared with the results of a patient survey, providers underestimated the portal's usefulness to patients, and ranked features as ",

        "Title": "Behavioral Interventions Using Consumer Information Technology as Tools to Advance Health Equity.",
        "Abstract": "The digital divide related to consumer information technologies (CITs) has diminished, thus increasing the potential to use CITs to overcome barriers of access to health interventions as well as to deliver interventions situated in the context of daily lives. However, the evidence base regarding the use and impact of CIT-enabled interventions in health disparity populations lags behind that for the general population. Literature and case examples are summarized to demonstrate the use of mHealth, telehealth, and social media as behavioral intervention platforms in health disparity populations, identify challenges to achieving their use, describe strategies for overcoming the challenges, and recommend future directions. The evidence base is emerging. However, challenges in design, implementation, and evaluation must be addressed for the promise to be fulfilled. Future directions include (1) improved design methods, (2) enhanced research reporting, (3) advancement of multilevel interventions, (4) rigorous evaluation, (5) efforts to address privacy concerns, and (6) inclusive design and implementation decisions.",

        "Abstract": "Heritability is essential for understanding the biological causes of disease but requires laborious patient recruitment and phenotype ascertainment. Electronic health records (EHRs) passively capture a wide range of clinically relevant data and provide a resource for studying the heritability of traits that are not typically accessible. EHRs contain next-of-kin information collected via patient emergency contact forms, but until now, these data have gone unused in research. We mined emergency contact data at three academic medical centers and identified 7.4 million familial relationships while maintaining patient privacy. Identified relationships were consistent with genetically derived relatedness. We used EHR data to compute heritability estimates for 500 disease phenotypes. Overall, estimates were consistent with the literature and between sites. Inconsistencies were indicative of limitations and opportunities unique to EHR research. These analyses provide a validation of the use of EHRs for genetics and disease research.",

        "Abstract": "Biomarkers as common data elements (CDEs) are important for the characterization of biobehavioral symptoms given that once a biologic moderator or mediator is identified, biologically based strategies can be investigated for treatment efforts. Just as a symptom inventory reflects a symptom experience, a biomarker is an indicator of the symptom, though not the symptom per se. The purposes of this position paper are to (a) identify a \"minimum set\" of biomarkers for consideration as CDEs in symptom and self-management science, specifically biochemical biomarkers; (b) evaluate the benefits and limitations of such a limited array of biomarkers with implications for symptom science; (c) propose a strategy for the collection of the endorsed minimum set of biologic samples to be employed as CDEs for symptom science; and (d) conceptualize this minimum set of biomarkers consistent with National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) symptoms of fatigue, depression, cognition, pain, and sleep disturbance.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this integrative review was to describe current US trends for health technology-enabled adherence interventions among behaviorally HIV-infected youth (ages 13-29\u00a0years), and present the feasibility and efficacy of identified interventions. A comprehensive search was executed across five electronic databases (January 2005-March 2016). Of the 1911 identified studies, nine met the inclusion criteria of quantitative or mixed methods design, technology-enabled adherence and or retention intervention for US HIV-infected youth. The majority were small pilots. Intervention dose varied between studies applying similar technology platforms with more than half not informed by a theoretical framework. Retention in care was not a reported outcome, and operationalization of adherence was heterogeneous across studies. Despite these limitations, synthesized findings from this review demonstrate feasibility of computer-based interventions, and initial efficacy of SMS texting for adherence support among HIV-infected youth. Moving forward, there is a pressing need for the expansion of this evidence base.",

Data were analyzed using descriptive and correlational statistics, and logistic regression with the dependent variable of cancer worry. Independent variables for the regression were: age, gender, marital status, education, socioeconomic status, previous diagnosis of cancer, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and chronic burden. Four variables significantly increased cancer worry: married marital status (OR\u2009=\u20091.19 [95% CI 1.01, 1.41]), younger age (OR\u2009=\u2009.992 [95% CI 0.987, 0.997]), less depression (OR\u2009=\u2009.96 [95% CI 0.94, 0.98]), and cancer diagnosis (OR\u2009=\u20092.12 [95% CI 1.24, 3.65]). New knowledge was generated on the contextual factors that influence these health concerns in a major Hispanic sub-group. Implications for practice, research and education are discussed.",

Our purpose was to identify relationships between PLWH perceptions of IHS and demographic, clinical, overall health, health-related quality of life, and perceived health care provider (HCP) social support. Using survey data from PLWH (n\u00a0=\u00a0292) in an urban HIV clinic, we first examined the reliability and validity of an existing IHS measure. Exploratory factor analysis revealed that the IHS score was composed of three factors: (a) Perception of Negative Societal Beliefs, (b) Fear of Disclosure, and (c) Perception of Negative HCP Beliefs, which were used as dependent variables in the multivariate analysis. In multivariate regression models, gender, education, quality of life, Getting Needed Care, and Trust in\u00a0HCP were significantly related to at least one IHS factor. Our findings advance the measurement of IHS and provide a foundation for intervention development to reduce IHS in care settings.",

        "Abstract": "Federal regulations have encouraged the electronic sharing of protected health information (PHI). As an opt-in state, New York abides by an affirmative consent model where PHI is electronically shared only after written consent is obtained. The purpose of our study was to describe sociotechnical factors that influence health information exchange (HIE) consent for persons living with HIV (PLWH) at one clinic in New York City. We employed mixed methods to gather perceptions of facilitators and barriers to HIE consent. Study participants included PLWH, staff, and clinicians. The mixed-methods approach revealed multiple interruptions in clinical workflow, staff and providers' time constraints, and lack of dedicated personnel focused on HIE consent as the major barriers to HIE consent. Although there is no one strategy to resolve barriers to HIE consent, having a dedicated person was identified as the most salient factor for facilitating HIE consent.",

This paper aims to provide a framework for organizing research of OHCs and help identify questions to explore for future informatics research. Based on the framework, we conceptualize OHCs from a social support standpoint and identify variables of interest in characterizing community members.

In this paper, we report on the final step in a three-stage user-centered design process for the development of a mHealth app for PLWH. We conducted a usability evaluation with 10 targeted end-users and a heuristic evaluation with 5 persons with informatics expertise to assess the usability of a prototype mHealth app for PLWH to manage their health. At the end of our usability evaluation, we finalized a Design Document that included the user interface design and functional specifications of the mHealth app. The functional areas which were identified at the end of our iterative process included: Communication, Reminders, Medication Logs, Lab Reports, Pharmacy Info, Nutrition and Fitness, Resources and Settings.",

SCD primarily affects African American, Hispanic and other traditionally underserved populations. Hydroxyurea (HU), an oral, once-daily medication, is the only approved therapeutic drug for sickle cell disease and markedly reduces symptoms, morbidity and mortality and improves quality of life largely by increasing hemoglobin F blood levels. This paper presents the rationale, study design and protocol for an open label randomized controlled trial to improve parent-youth partnerships in self-management and medication adherence to HU in adolescents with SCD.",

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of obesity is rising rapidly among Hispanics/Latinas. We evaluated the prevalence of being obese or overweight and associated risk factors among 630 low-income, Latina women from ambulatory care clinics in Upper Manhattan. Overall, 37\u00a0% of the sample was overweight and 41\u00a0% of the sample was obese, and yet, almost half of women who are overweight considered their weight \"just about right.\" After adjusting for socio-demographic, behavioral, and biological risk factors, being obese was strongly associated with having hypertension [relative risk ratio (RRR) 3.93, 1.75-8.82], pre-hypertension (RRR 2.59, 1.43-4.67), diabetes (RRR 2.50, 1.21-5.14) and moderate/moderately severe/severe depression (RRR 2.09, 1.03-4.26). Women who reported that finding time was a barrier to physical activity were also more likely to be obese (RRR 1.78, 1.04-3.02). Chronic financial stress was associated with lower risk of being overweight (RRR 0.47, 0.28-0.79) or obese (RRR 0.51, 0.31-0.86), as well as eating out at restaurants (RRR 0.75, 0.62-0.89). Opportunities for intervention relate to understanding cultural factors around perceptions of weight and helping women find the time for physical activity.",

While patient engagement has been a focus in the outpatient setting, strategies to engage inpatients in their care have not been well studied. We are undertaking a study to assess how patients' information needs during hospitalization can be addressed with health information technologies. To achieve this aim, we developed a personalized inpatient portal that allows patients to see who is on their care team, monitor their vital signs, review medications being administered, review current and historical lab and test results, confirm allergies, document pain scores and send questions and comments to inpatient care providers. The purpose of this paper is to describe the protocol for the study.",

        "Abstract": "Symptom management research is a core area of nursing science and one of the priorities for the National Institute of Nursing Research, which specifically focuses on understanding the biological and behavioral aspects of symptoms such as pain and fatigue, with the goal of developing new knowledge and new strategies for improving patient health and quality of life. The types and volume of data related to the symptom experience, symptom management strategies, and outcomes are increasingly accessible for research. Traditional data streams are now complemented by consumer-generated (i.e., quantified self) and \"omic\" data streams. Thus, the data available for symptom science can be considered big data. The purposes of this chapter are to (a) briefly summarize the current drivers for the use of big data in research; (b) describe the promise of big data and associated data science methods for advancing symptom management research; (c) explicate the potential perils of big data and data science from the perspective of the ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, and justice; and (d) illustrate strategies for balancing the promise and the perils of big data through a case study of a community at high risk for health disparities. Big data and associated data science methods offer the promise of multidimensional data sources and new methods to address significant research gaps in symptom management. If nurse scientists wish to apply big data and data science methods to advance symptom management research and promote health equity, they must carefully consider both the promise and perils.",

        "Abstract": "Healthcare environments are increasingly implementing health information technology (HIT) and those from various professions must be competent to use HIT in meaningful ways. In addition, HIT has been shown to enable interprofessional approaches to health care. The purpose of this article is to describe the refinement of the Self-Assessment of Nursing Informatics Competencies Scale (SANICS) using analytic techniques based upon item response theory (IRT) and discuss its relevance to interprofessional education and practice. In a sample of 604 nursing students, the 93-item version of SANICS was examined using non-parametric IRT. The iterative modeling procedure included 31 steps comprising: (1) assessing scalability, (2) assessing monotonicity, (3) assessing invariant item ordering, and (4) expert input. SANICS was reduced to an 18-item hierarchical scale with excellent reliability. Fundamental skills for team functioning and shared decision making among team members (e.g. \"using monitoring systems appropriately,\" \"describing general systems to support clinical care\") had the highest level of difficulty, and \"demonstrating basic technology skills\" had the lowest difficulty level. Most items reflect informatics competencies relevant to all health professionals. Further, the approaches can be applied to construct a new hierarchical scale or refine an existing scale related to informatics attitudes or competencies for various health professions.",

Mobile health technology is a promising tool for HIV prevention. The purpose of this study was to identify the desired content, features and functions of a mobile application (app) for HIV prevention in high-risk MSM. We conducted five focus group sessions with 33 MSM. Focus group recordings were transcribed and coded using themes informed by the information-motivation-behavioral (IMB) skills model. Participants identified information needs related to HIV prevention: HIV testing and prophylaxis distribution centers, support groups/peers, and HIV/STI disease/treatment information. Areas of motivation to target for the app included: attitudes and intentions. Participants identified behavioral skills to address with an app: using condoms correctly, negotiating safer sex, recognizing signs of HIV/STI. Findings from this work provide insight into the desired content of a mobile app for HIV prevention in high-risk MSM.",

        "Abstract": "There is preliminary evidence that mobile health (mHealth) apps are feasible, attractive, and an effective platform for the creation of self-management tools for persons living with HIV (PLWH). As a foundation for the current study, we conducted formative research using focus groups, participatory design sessions, and usability evaluation methods to inform the development of a health management app for PLWH. The formative research resulted in identification of the following functional requirements of a mHealth app for self-management: (1) communication between providers and peers, (2) medication reminders, (3) medication log, (4) lab reports, (5) pharmacy information, (6) nutrition and fitness, (7) resources (eg, social services, substance use, video testimonials), (8) settings, and (9) search function.",

        "Abstract": "Research Data eXplorer (RedX) was designed to support self-service research data queries and cohort identification from clinical research databases. The primary innovation of RedX was the electronic health record view of patient data, to provide better contextual understanding for non-technical users in building complex data queries. The design of RedX around this need identified multiple functions that would use individual patient views to better understand population-based data, and vice-versa. During development, the more necessary and valuable components of RedX were refined, leading to a functional self-service query and cohort identification tool. However, with the improved capabilities and extensibility of other applications for data querying and navigation, our long-term implementation and dissemination plans have moved towards consolidation and alignment of RedX functions as enhancements in these other initiatives.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the benefits of advance directives (AD) to patients and care providers, they are often not completed due to lack of patient awareness. The purpose of the current article is to advocate for creation and use of an innovative information visualization (infovisual) as a health communication tool aimed at improving AD dissemination and engagement. The infovisual would promote AD awareness by encouraging patients to learn about their options and inspire contemplation and conversation regarding their end-of-life (EOL) journey. An infovisual may be able to communicate insights that are often communicated in words, but are much more powerfully communicated by example. Furthermore, an infovisual could facilitate vivid understanding of options and inspire the beginning of often difficult conversations among care providers, patients, and loved ones. It may also save clinicians time, as care providers may be able to spend less time explaining details of EOL care options. Use of an infovisual could assist in ensuring a well-planned EOL journey.",

At the same time, use of mobile health (mHealth) technology raises privacy and security concerns of consumers. The goal of this analysis was to understand the perceived ease of use, usefulness, risk and trust that contribute to behavioral intention to use a mobile application for meeting the healthcare needs of persons living with HIV (PLWH). To understand these issues, we conducted focus group sessions with 50 persons living with HIV and 30 HIV healthcare providers. We used the e-commerce acceptance model to analyze our focus group data. Findings from the study demonstrated the need for mHealth to be perceived as useful, easy to use, with little perceived risk accompanied by a measure of trust in the creators of the technology. Findings from this work can inform future work on patients and providers' perceptions of risk, trust, ease of use and usefulness of mHealth technology.",

Main predictors for active transport (accuracy=69.29%, precision=0.67, recall=0.69) were immigrant status, high level of anxiety, having a place for physical activity, and willingness to make time for physical activity. The main predictors for screen time (accuracy=63.13%, precision=0.60, recall=0.63) were willingness to make time for exercise, having a place for exercise, age, and availability of family support to access health information on the Internet. Data mining methods were useful to identify intervention targets and inform design of customized interventions.",

The objective of this study is to examine methods and issues in summarizing and evaluating the accuracy of clinical data as compared to primary research data. We hypothesized that research survey data on a patient cohort could serve as a reference standard for uncovering potential biases in clinical data. We compared the summary statistics between clinical and research datasets. Seven clinical variables, i.e., height, weight, gender, ethnicity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and diabetes status, were included in the study. Our results show that the clinical data and research data had similar summary statistical profiles, but there are detectable differences in definitions and measurements for individual variables such as height, diastolic blood pressure, and diabetes status. We discuss the implications of these results and confirm the important considerations for using research data to verify clinical data accuracy.",

Qualitative research methods were used to identify the desired content and features of a mobile app for meeting and improving the healthcare needs of persons living with HIV (PLWH). We conducted six focus group sessions with 50 English-or Spanish-speaking PLWH in New York City. To inform data analysis and to illustrate how mHealth technology can be used as a persuasive strategy for improving the health of PLWH, we integrated Fogg's functional role triad for computing technology model with the self-determination theory to illustrate how mHealth technology can be used as a persuasive strategy for improving the health of PLWH. Participants suggested several tools for meeting their healthcare needs, including: reminders/alerts, lab results tracking, and notes on health status. mHealth technology can function as a social actor by providing chat boxes/forums, testimonials of lived experiences, and personal outreach. Examples of media that can be used as a persuasive technology include games/virtual rewards, coding of health tasks, and simulations on how to connect with PLWH. Findings from these focus groups can be used to design a mobile app for PLWH\u00a0that is targeted to meet their healthcare needs.",

        "Abstract": "User-composable approaches provide clinicians with the control to design and assemble information elements on screen via drag/drop. They hold considerable promise for enhancing the electronic-health-records (EHRs) user experience. We previously described this novel approach to EHR design and our illustrative system, MedWISE. The purpose of this paper is to describe clinician users' intelligent uses of space during completion of real patient case studies in a laboratory setting using MedWISE. Thirteen clinicians at a quaternary academic medical center used the system to review four real patient cases. We analyzed clinician utterances, behaviors, screen layouts (i.e., interface designs), and their perceptions associated with completing patient case studies. Clinicians effectively used the system to review all cases. Two coding schemata pertaining to human-computer interaction and diagnostic reasoning were used to analyze the data. Users adopted three main interaction strategies: rapidly gathering items on screen and reviewing ('opportunistic selection' approach); creating highly structured screens ('structured' approach); and interacting with small groups of items in sequence as their case review progressed ('dynamic stage' approach). They also used spatial arrangement in ways predicted by theory and research on workplace spatial arrangement. This includes assignment of screen regions for particular purposes (24% of spatial codes), juxtaposition to facilitate calculation or other cognitive tasks ('epistemic action'), and grouping elements with common meanings or relevance to the diagnostic facets of the case (20.3%). A left-to-right progression of orienting materials, data, and action items or reflection space was a commonly observed pattern. Widget selection was based on user assessment of what information was useful or relevant. We developed and tested an illustrative system that gives clinicians greater control of the EHR, and demonstrated its feasibility for case review by typical clinicians. Producing the simplifying inventions, such as user-composable platforms that shift control to the user, may serve to promote productive EHR use and enhance its value as an instrument of patient care.",

        "Abstract": "Creating electronic health records that support the uniquely complex and varied needs of healthcare presents formidable challenges. To address some of these challenges we created a new model for healthcare information systems, embodied in MedWISE,(2) a widget-based highly configurable electronic health record (EHR) platform. Founded on the idea that providing clinician users with greater control of the EHR may result in greater fit to user needs and preferences, MedWISE allows drag/drop user configurations and the sharing of user-created elements such as custom laboratory result panels and user-created interface tabs. After reviewing the current state of EHR configurability, we describe the philosophical, theoretical and practical rationales for our model, and the specific functionality of MedWISE. The alternative approach may have several advantages for human-computer interaction, efficiency, cognition, and fit of EHR tools to different contexts and tasks. We discuss potential issues raised by this approach.",

Copy and paste is a solution to clinicians' needs that has associated downsides including errors. As part of a study of clinicians using an innovative system which gives them complete control over information selection and arrangement, two used the process of note splitting to meet needs that are sometimes solved through cut and paste; four others used text insertion (partial note sections) to address related needs. The purpose of this study is to enhance understanding of the note splitting and text insertion phenomena by describing the processes, the resulting creations, and the associated clinician rationales. Mixed methods included a thinkaloud protocol and analysis of user interface creations and time sequences.",

Natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to improve the efficiency of such translation. However, it is laborious to develop NLP to structure free-text CPGs using existing formal knowledge representations (KR). In response to this challenge, this vision paper discusses the value and feasibility of supporting symbiosis in text-based knowledge acquisition (KA) and KR. We compare two ontologies: (1) an ontology manually created by domain experts for CPG eligibility criteria and (2) an upper-level ontology derived from a semantic pattern-based approach for automatic KA from CPG eligibility criteria text. Then we discuss the strengths and limitations of interweaving KA and NLP for KR purposes and important considerations for achieving the symbiosis of KR and NLP for structuring CPGs to achieve evidence-based clinical practice.",

        "Abstract": "Access to personal health information assists efforts to improve health outcomes and creates a population of active and informed health consumers. Understanding this significance, Healthy People 2020 retained, as a Focus Area, the need for improved interactive Health Communication and HIT. Attainment of this goal includes increasing the use of Internet-based electronic personal health management tools (EPHMT). Health information management, essential for favorable health outcomes, can be problematic in low income, special needs populations with complex chronic illnesses such as HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, barriers to the adoption and acceptance of an EPHMT in such populations have not been well explored. The current study seeks to explore the usability of an EPHMT entitled MyHealthProfile and to identify perceived health information needs in a vulnerable population of people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWH) that have access to an EPHMT through their Medicaid Special Needs Plan.",

Methods described include: 1) six steps of data mining to build a disease model using classification techniques, 2) an innovative approach to analyzing high-dimensionality data, and 3) a visualization strategy to communicate with clinicians who are unfamiliar with advanced statistics. Our application of data mining strategies identified childhood experience living with mentally ill and sexual abuse, and limited usual activity as the strongest correlates of depression among hundreds variables. The methods that we applied may be useful to others wishing to build a classification model from complex, large volume datasets for other health conditions.",

The aims of this study were (1) to explore the current technologies available for low-cost communication with family living abroad and (2) to assess the level of awareness and use of low-cost technologies for family communication as well as related information needs among low-income foreign-born individuals. This mixed-methods study included an environmental scan, survey, and focus groups with low-income foreign-born individuals living in East Harlem in New York City. Low-income individuals who have family members living abroad face financial stress with complicated technology choices for communication with family living abroad and they have many information needs. They would welcome interactive and convenient educational tools that (1) build skills for utilization of various technologies and (2) provide decision support to simplify choosing among the vast array of available communication options.",

Low levels of health literacy contribute to poor comprehension and undermine the confidence necessary for health self-management. Visualizations are useful for minimizing comprehension gaps when communicating complex quantitative information. The process of developing visualizations that accommodate the needs of individuals with varying levels of health literacy remains undefined. In this paper we provide detailed descriptions of a) an iterative methodological approach to the development of visualizations, b) the resulting types of visualizations and examples thereof, and c) the types of data the visualizations will be used to convey. We briefly describe subsequent phases in which the visualizations will be tested and refined. Web deployment of the final visualizations will support the ethical obligation to return the data to the research participants and community that contributed it.",

        "Abstract": "Midwives in rural Ghana work at the frontline of the health care system, where they have access to essential data about the patient population. However, current methods of data capture, primarily pen and paper, make the data neither accessible nor usable for monitoring patient care or program evaluation. Electronic health (eHealth) systems present a potential mechanism for enhancing the roles of midwives by providing tools for collecting, exchanging, and viewing patient data as well as offering midwives the possibility for receiving information and decision support. Introducing such technology in low-resource settings has been challenging because of low levels of user acceptance, software design that does not match the end-user environment, and/or unforeseen challenges such as irregular power availability. These challenges are often attributable to a lack of understanding by the software developers of the end users' needs and work environment.",

Nearly 300 competitive awards have been made to mostly community-based organizations. A formal evaluation was undertaken to determine the performance and impact of the ACIOP. A mixed methods design combined quantitative abstractions and summarization of 47 awardee final reports from 44 organizations, and qualitative telephone interviews with 17 individuals representing 20 projects. Findings revealed that project objectives were mostly met; high-risk populations were reached; low resource organizations were funded; community partnerships were significant; projects built on existing efforts; information resources and training were tailored to local needs; and most projects overcame barriers experienced. Needed modifications centered on: 1) enhancing evaluation capacity at the individual project level and 2) revising project reporting requirements to increase the amount of information available to assess the ACIOP; both have been implemented.",

This study aims to characterize the temporal usage of an RNS, Columbia University Scientific Profiles (CUSP), and to inform the designs of general RNSs. We installed a free usage logging service, Google Analytics, on CUSP and applied time series analysis to compare the usage patterns of the two modes of CUSP: restricted (authenticated) and open access. More users searched by person names than by topics, although the latter enables in-depth vertical search of co-author or co-investigator networks for grants or publications. The open-access mode received more page views but less average time spent on each page than the restricted access mode. The numbers of unique users and searches have increased over the time. This study contributes a trend analysis framework for understanding the usage of RNSs and early knowledge of the usage of an open-access RNS.",

        "Abstract": "User needs understanding is critical for developing useful and usable clinical research decision support. Existing methods largely depend on self-reporting and often fail to elicit implicit or fine-grained user needs. We hypothesized that functional software would address this problem by presenting to users existing technology while simultaneously encouraging users to optimize workflow. Using clinical research visit scheduling as an example, we used a piece of software under development that was called IMPACT to reveal user needs iteratively. The identified user needs explained why most clinical research coordinators still rely on paper to schedule clinical research visits. The common user needs themes such as information completeness for software to be useful may generalize to other clinical decision support. This paper contributes valuable firsthand knowledge about user needs for decision support for clinical research visit scheduling among clinical research coordinators and a generalizable methodology for collecting and analyzing software usage data to inform user needs elicitation.",

Since mHealth technology comprises evolving and adaptable hardware and software, it provides many challenging design problems. To address this challenge, our methods were guided by the Information System Research (ISR) framework. This paper focuses on the Design Cycle of the ISR framework in which we used user-centered distributed information design methods and participatory action research methods to inform the design of a mobile application (app) for PLWH. In the first design session, participants (N=5) identified features that are optimal for meeting the treatment and management needs of PLWH. In the second design session, participants (N=6) were presented with findings from the first design session and pictures of existing apps. Findings from the Design Cycle will be evaluated with usability inspection methods. Using a systematic approach has the potential to improve mHealth functionality and use and subsequent impact.",

        "Abstract": "Underspecified user needs and frequent lack of a gold standard reference are typical barriers to technology evaluation. To address this problem, this paper presents a two-phase evaluation framework involving usability experts (phase 1) and end-users (phase 2). In phase 1, a cross-system functionality alignment between expert-derived user needs and system functions was performed to inform the choice of \"the best available\" comparison system to enable a cognitive walkthrough in phase 1 and a comparative effectiveness evaluation in phase 2. During phase 2, five quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods are mixed to assess usability: time-motion analysis, software log, questionnaires - System Usability Scale and the Unified Theory of Acceptance of Use of Technology, think-aloud protocols, and unstructured interviews. Each method contributes data for a unique measure (e.g., time motion analysis contributes task-completion-time; software log contributes action transition frequency). The measures are triangulated to yield complementary insights regarding user-perceived ease-of-use, functionality integration, anxiety during use, and workflow impact. To illustrate its use, we applied this framework in a formative evaluation of a software called Integrated Model for Patient Care and Clinical Trials (IMPACT). We conclude that this mixed-methods evaluation framework enables an integrated assessment of user needs satisfaction and user-perceived usefulness and usability of a novel design. This evaluation framework effectively bridges the gap between co-evolving user needs and technology designs during iterative prototyping and is particularly useful when it is difficult for users to articulate their needs for technology support due to the lack of a baseline.",

Any new design poses new potential problems; here we discuss the accuracy, potential for new types of errors, and user reactions to the approach, including their perceptions of ease of use and usefulness. Our results come from a mixed methods laboratory study with 18 clinicians at a large academic medical center. 12 used MedWISE and 6 used the conventional system. MedWISE users had comparable assessment accuracy to use of the conventional system, low (1/10) risk of diagnosis momentum error, and overall favorable and even enthusiastic user perception. 10/12 said the system eased their cognitive process, Ease of use and usefulness were rated 3.79 and 4.00 on a 5-point Likert scale. Users were unconcerned about the possibility of increased errors due to their trust in colleagues and system similarities to current practice. After first describing the issues, we suggest a method to elucidate risks in innovative and current systems.",

        "Abstract": "Integration of clinical decision support services (CDSS) into electronic health records (EHRs) may be integral to widespread dissemination and use of clinical prediction rules in the emergency department (ED). However, the best way to design such services to maximize their usefulness in such a complex setting is poorly understood. We conducted a multi-site cross-sectional qualitative study whose aim was to describe the sociotechnical environment in the ED to inform the design of a CDSS intervention to implement the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) clinical prediction rules for children with minor blunt head trauma. Informed by a sociotechnical model consisting of eight dimensions, we conducted focus groups, individual interviews and workflow observations in 11 EDs, of which 5 were located in academic medical centers and 6 were in community hospitals. A total of 126 ED clinicians, information technology specialists, and administrators participated. We clustered data into 19 categories of sociotechnical factors through a process of thematic analysis and subsequently organized the categories into a sociotechnical matrix consisting of three high-level sociotechnical dimensions (workflow and communication, organizational factors, human factors) and three themes (interdisciplinary assessment processes, clinical practices related to prediction rules, EHR as a decision support tool). Design challenges that emerged from the analysis included the need to use structured data fields to support data capture and re-use while maintaining efficient care processes, supporting interdisciplinary communication, and facilitating family-clinician interaction for decision-making.",

Twitter is a short-text message system developed 6 years ago, now with more than 100 million users generating over 300 million Tweets every day. Twitter may be used to gain real-world insights to promote healthy behaviors. The purposes of this paper are to describe a practical approach to analyzing Tweet contents and to illustrate an application of the approach to the topic of physical activity. The approach includes five steps: (1) selecting keywords to gather an initial set of Tweets to analyze; (2) importing data; (3) preparing data; (4) analyzing data (topic, sentiment, and ecologic context); and (5) interpreting data. The steps are implemented using tools that are publically available and free of charge and designed for use by researchers with limited programming skills. Content mining of Tweets can contribute to addressing challenges in health behavior research.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a clinical research visit scheduling system that can potentially coordinate clinical research visits with patient care visits and increase efficiency at clinical sites where clinical and research activities occur simultaneously. Participatory Design methods were applied to support requirements engineering and to create this software called Integrated Model for Patient Care and Clinical Trials (IMPACT). Using a multi-user constraint satisfaction and resource optimization algorithm, IMPACT automatically synthesizes temporal availability of various research resources and recommends the optimal dates and times for pending research visits. We conducted scenario-based evaluations with 10 clinical research coordinators (CRCs) from diverse clinical research settings to assess the usefulness, feasibility, and user acceptance of IMPACT. We obtained qualitative feedback using semi-structured interviews with the CRCs. Most CRCs acknowledged the usefulness of IMPACT features. Support for collaboration within research teams and interoperability with electronic health records and clinical trial management systems were highly requested features. Overall, IMPACT received satisfactory user acceptance and proves to be potentially useful for a variety of clinical research settings. Our future work includes comparing the effectiveness of IMPACT with that of existing scheduling solutions on the market and conducting field tests to formally assess user adoption.",

The scale had a valid five-factor structure, accounting for 69.38% of the variance, high internal consistency reliabilities (0.96 for the total scale and 0.84 to 0.94 for subscales), and good responsiveness (standardized response mean = 0.99), as well as significantly improved scores in nursing students with diverse demographic and educational backgrounds after taking an informatics course. Our factor structure was similar to the original scale, differing slightly in four items' loadings. This difference may reflect current informatics practice or the greater diversity of our sample. Further research is needed on the factor, data/information management skills, and related item loadings. This scale could be used to assess informatics competencies and develop educational strategies that prepare nursing students as informatics-competent graduates in information technology-rich environments.",

The authors present an organizing framework that integrates outcomes and informatics research paradigms to guide knowledge discovery in electronic clinical databases. They illustrate its application using the example of hospital acquired pressure ulcers (HAPU). The Knowledge Discovery through Informatics for Comparative Effectiveness Research (KDI-CER) framework was conceived as a heuristic to conceptualize study designs and address potential methodological limitations imposed by using a single research perspective. Advances in informatics research can play a complementary role in advancing the field of outcomes research including CER. The KDI-CER framework can be used to facilitate knowledge discovery from routinely collected electronic clinical data.",

        "Abstract": "This paper describes our considerations and methods for implementing an open-source centralized research data repository (CRDR) and reports its impact on retrospective outcomes research capacity in the urology department at Columbia University. We performed retrospective pretest and post-test analyses of user acceptance, workflow efficiency, and publication quantity and quality (measured by journal impact factor) before and after the implementation. The CRDR transformed the research workflow and enabled a new research model. During the pre- and post-test periods, the department's average annual retrospective study publication rate was 11.5 and 25.6, respectively; the average publication impact score was 1.7 and 3.1, respectively. The new model was adopted by 62.5% (5/8) of the clinical scientists within the department. Additionally, four basic science researchers outside the department took advantage of the implemented model. The average proximate time required to complete a retrospective study decreased from 12 months before the implementation to <6 months after the implementation. Implementing a CRDR appears to be effective in enhancing the outcomes research capacity for one academic department.",

        "Abstract": "To address the electronic health data fragmentation that is a methodological limitation of comparative effectiveness research (CER), the Washington Heights Inwood Informatics Infrastructure for Comparative Effectiveness Research (WICER) project is creating a patient-centered research data warehouse (RDW) by linking electronic clinical data (ECD) from New York Presbyterian Hospital's clinical data warehouse with ECD from ambulatory care, long-term care, and home health settings and the WICER community health survey (CHS). The purposes of the research were to identify areas of overlap between the WICER CHS and two other surveys that include health behavior data (the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Survey and the New York City Community Health Survey (NYC CHS)) and to identify gaps in the current WICER RDW that have the potential to affect patient-centered CER.",

        "Abstract": "Next-generation tablets (iPads and Android tablets) may potentially improve the collection and management of clinical research data. The widespread adoption of tablets, coupled with decreased software and hardware costs, has led to increased consideration of tablets for primary research data collection. When using tablets for the Washington Heights/Inwood Infrastructure for Comparative Effectiveness Research (WICER) project, we found that the devices give rise to inherent security issues associated with the potential use of cloud-based data storage approaches. This paper identifies and describes major security considerations for primary data collection with tablets; proposes a set of architectural strategies for implementing data collection forms with tablet computers; and discusses the security, cost, and workflow of each strategy. The paper briefly reviews the strategies with respect to their implementation for three primary data collection activities for the WICER project.",

Greater patient complexity was a significant predictor of identifying a diagnostic or management and treatment issue. The presence of an electronic health record was not related to reporting of a patient safety issue.",

This study contributes a method for evaluating RNSs and initial usage knowledge of one RNS obtained from using this method. We designed a log for an institutional RNS, defined categories of users and tasks, and analyzed correlations between usage patterns and user and query types. Our results show that scientific professionals spend more time performing deep Web searching on RNSs than generic Google users and we also show that retrieving scientist profiles is faster on an RNS than on Google (3.5 seconds vs. 34.2 seconds) whereas organization-specific browsing on a RNS takes longer than on Google (117.0 seconds vs. 34.2 seconds). Usage patterns vary by user role, e.g., faculty performed more informational queries than administrators, which implies role-specific user support is needed for RNSs.",

        "Title": "Assessing Electronic Note Quality Using the Physician Documentation Quality Instrument (PDQI-9).",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To refine the Physician Documentation Quality Instrument (PDQI) and test the validity and reliability of the 9-item version (PDQI-9). METHODS: Three sets each of admission notes, progress notes and discharge summaries were evaluated by two groups of physicians using the PDQI-9 and an overall general assessment: one gold standard group consisting of program or assistant program directors (n=7), and the other of attending physicians or chief residents (n=24). The main measures were criterion-related validity (correlation coefficients between Total PDQI-9 scores and 1-item General Impression scores for each note), discriminant validity (comparison of PDQI-9 scores on notes rated as best and worst using 1-item General Impression score), internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha), and inter-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)). RESULTS: The results were criterion-related validity (r = -.678 to .856), discriminant validity (best versus worst note, t = 9.3, p = .003), internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alphas = .87-.94), and inter-rater reliability (ICC = .83, CI = .72-.91). CONCLUSION: The results support the criterion-related and discriminant validity, internal consistency reliability, and inter-rater reliability of the PDQI-9 for rating the quality of electronic physician notes. Tools for assessing note redundancy are required to complement use of PDQI-9. Trials of the PDQI-9 at other institutions, of different size, using different EHRs, and incorporating additional physician specialties and notes of other healthcare providers are needed to confirm its generalizability.",

In healthcare, inattention to workflow is associated with poorly accepted systems and unforeseen effects of use. How best to examine workflow for the purpose of system design is in itself the subject of scientific inquiry. Several disciplines offer approaches to the study of workflow that can be tailored to meet the needs of systems designers in healthcare settings. This paper will describe several methodologies for workflow analysis according to the major schools of thought from which they have been developed. The level of workflow they examine and their theoretical underpinnings will also be described.",

The primary aim of this descriptive qualitative study was to understand case managers' perceptions of the two systems. Focus group methodology was used to gather perceptions from 48 participants. Major themes by factor included: barriers (technical difficulties, quality of data, and confidentiality breaches), and facilitators (training/ user support, work efficiency, and improved coordination of care). EDSs may be particularly useful in improving coordination of services and information sharing for HIV case managers. Careful attention must be paid to barriers and facilitators for use of these EDSs so that they can best meet the healthcare and social service needs of PLWH.",

Despite a large proportion of malpractice claims the result of diagnostic error, the use of diagnostic decision support to improve diagnostic accuracy has not been widely used among healthcare professionals. Moreover, while the use of diagnostic decision support has been studied in attending physicians, residents, medical students and advanced practice nurses, the use of decision support among Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) students has not been studied. The authors have implemented the Isabel diagnostic decision support system into the curriculum and are evaluating its impact. The goals of the evaluation study are to describe the diagnostic accuracy and self-reported confidence levels of Pediatric Nurse Practitioner (PNP) and Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) students over the course of their programs, to examine changes in diagnostic accuracy and self-reported confidence levels over the study period, and to evaluate differences between FNP and PNP students in diagnostic accuracy and self-reported confidence levels for pediatric cases.

In a laboratory setting, nurses were asked to follow a speak-aloud protocol while reviewing a scripted medication list. We coded the nurses' information seeking behavior utilizing a previously described framework. Our findings suggest that 1) nurses predominately look through physician notes to gather clues in answering medication-related information needs and 2) nurses often leave the CIS to search other computerized sources for information about unfamiliar medications.",

        "Abstract": "The provision of personal health information through electronic personal health management tools (EPHMT) has the potential to improve health outcomes. However, little is known about factors that affect EPHMT use in special needs people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). The purpose of this study was to describe PLWH perceptions of predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors affecting use of one type of EPHMT, a continuity of care document (CCD). Data were collected through focus groups and qualitative interviews with PLWH (n=35), health care providers (N=19) and care site managers (N=5). All participant types identified predisposing barriers to CCD use including literacy, privacy, and technology access and enabling factors to promote CCD use including user support and password simplicity. People living with HIV/AIDS also identified reinforcing factors for recurring CCD use including emergent situations and reducing test redundancy. Results inform methods to promote use of the CCD and other EPHMT by special needs PLWH.",

        "Abstract": "Building on our institution's commercial electronic health record and custom personal health record Web portal, we developed a tablet computer application to provide interactive information to hospital patients. Using Apple iPad devices, the prototype application was provided to five patients in a cardiology step-down unit. We conducted detailed interviews to assess patients' knowledge of their inpatient care, as well as their perceptions of the usefulness of the application. While patients exhibited varying levels of comfort with using the tablet computer, they were highly enthusiastic about the application's ability to supply health information such as their inpatient medication histories and photographs of their care providers. Additional research is warranted to assess the benefit such applications may have for addressing inpatient information needs, enhancing patient-provider communication and improving patient satisfaction.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) contemplating brain surgery must make a complex treatment decision involving trade-offs. Patient decision aids, containing information on the risks and benefits of treatment interventions, increase patient knowledge and facilitate shared decision making between patients and physicians. We conducted five focus groups to describe the information patients need to make informed decisions about TLE surgery. Twenty patients who had undergone TLE surgery described the information used in their decision-making process, and evaluated the potential for a patient decision aid to assist other patients who are considering surgery. Thematic analysis revealed information needs that were both experiential (i.e., learning about other patients' experiences through testimonials) and factual (i.e., individualized statistical information). Patients also made suggestions on how this information should be delivered to patients. These data will accelerate the development of a patient decision aid designed to assist TLE patients in their decision making about epilepsy surgery.",

        "Abstract": "Healthcare information systems frequently do not truly meet clinician needs, due to the complexity, variability, and rapid change in medical contexts. Recently the internet world has been transformed by approaches commonly termed 'Web 2.0'. This paper proposes a Web 2.0 model for a healthcare adaptive architecture. The vision includes creating modular, user-composable systems which aim to make all necessary information from multiple internal and external sources available via a platform, for the user to use, arrange, recombine, author, and share at will, using rich interfaces where advisable. Clinicians can create a set of 'widgets' and 'views' which can transform data, reflect their domain knowledge and cater to their needs, using simple drag and drop interfaces without the intervention of programmers. We have built an example system, MedWISE, embodying the user-facing parts of the model. This approach to HIS is expected to have several advantages, including greater suitability to user needs (reflecting clinician rather than programmer concepts and priorities), incorporation of multiple information sources, agile reconfiguration to meet emerging situations and new treatment deployment, capture of user domain expertise and tacit knowledge, efficiencies due to workflow and human-computer interaction improvements, and greater user acceptance.",

        "Abstract": "Usability factors are a major obstacle to health information technology (IT) adoption. The purpose of this paper is to review and categorize health IT usability study methods and to provide practical guidance on health IT usability evaluation. 2025 references were initially retrieved from the Medline database from 2003 to 2009 that evaluated health IT used by clinicians. Titles and abstracts were first reviewed for inclusion. Full-text articles were then examined to identify final eligibility studies. 629 studies were categorized into the five stages of an integrated usability specification and evaluation framework that was based on a usability model and the system development life cycle (SDLC)-associated stages of evaluation. Theoretical and methodological aspects of 319 studies were extracted in greater detail and studies that focused on system validation (SDLC stage 2) were not assessed further. The number of studies by stage was: stage 1, task-based or user-task interaction, n=42; stage 2, system-task interaction, n=310; stage 3, user-task-system interaction, n=69; stage 4, user-task-system-environment interaction, n=54; and stage 5, user-task-system-environment interaction in routine use, n=199. The studies applied a variety of quantitative and qualitative approaches. Methodological issues included lack of theoretical framework/model, lack of details regarding qualitative study approaches, single evaluation focus, environmental factors not evaluated in the early stages, and guideline adherence as the primary outcome for decision support system evaluations. Based on the findings, a three-level stratified view of health IT usability evaluation is proposed and methodological guidance is offered based upon the type of interaction that is of primary interest in the evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "Case managers (CMs) facilitate continuity of care for persons living with HIV (PLWH) by coordination of resources and referrals to social services and medical care. The complexity of the management of HIV drives the need for more coordination, which can be achieved through the use of health information technology (HIT). However, HIT has not been well studied in the context of HIV services. The primary aim of this qualitative study was to assess CMs' perceptions regarding factors that influence acceptance and use of an electronic continuity of care record (CCR) for PLWH. Focus group methodology was used to gather perceptions from 37 CMs. Major themes related to factors for CCR adoption and use included: predisposing (system functionality and confidentiality), enabling (user training and computer access), reinforcing (work efficiency, continuity of care, information quality, and communication). Electronic CCRs have the potential to improve coordination of services and information sharing for PLWH. Careful attention must be paid to factors that predispose, enable, and reinforce use of HIT such as CCRs so that potential benefits in terms of quality and efficiency can be realized.",

To promote discovery, the design and results of these studies should be made machine-readable for large-scale data mining, synthesis, and re-analysis. The Human Studies Database Project aims to define and implement an informatics infrastructure for institutions to share the design of their human studies. We have developed the Ontology of Clinical Research (OCRe) to model study features such as design type, interventions, and outcomes to support scientific query and analysis. We are using OCRe as the reference semantics for federated data sharing of human studies over caGrid, and are piloting this implementation with several Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) institutions.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To support collaboration and clinician-targeted decision support, electronic health records (EHRs) must contain accurate information about patients' care providers. The objective of this study was to evaluate two approaches for care provider identification employed within a commercial EHR at a large academic medical center. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of EHR data for 121 patients in two cardiology wards during a four-week period. System audit logs of chart accesses were analyzed to identify the clinicians who were likely participating in the patients' hospital care. The audit log data were compared with two functions in the EHR for documenting care team membership: 1) a vendor-supplied module called \"Care Providers\", and 2) a custom \"Designate Provider\" order that was created primarily to improve accuracy of the attending physician of record documentation. RESULTS: For patients with a 3-5 day hospital stay, an average of 30.8 clinicians accessed the electronic chart, including 10.2 nurses, 1.4 attending physicians, 2.3 residents, and 5.4 physician assistants. The Care Providers module identified 2.7 clinicians/patient (1.8 attending physicians and 0.9 nurses). The Designate Provider order identified 2.1 clinicians/patient (1.1 attending physicians, 0.2 resident physicians, and 0.8 physician assistants). Information about other members of patients' care teams (social workers, dietitians, pharmacists, etc.) was absent. CONCLUSIONS: The two methods for specifying care team information failed to identify numerous individuals involved in patients' care, suggesting that commercial EHRs may not provide adequate tools for care team designation. Improvements to EHR tools could foster greater collaboration among care teams and reduce communication-related risks to patient safety.",

The aim of this study was to assess the construct validity (factor analysis and discriminant validity), internal consistency reliability (Cronbach \u03b1), and responsiveness (independent-samples t test) of the Attitudes toward Handheld Decision Support Software Scale in a sample of 103 nursing students engaged in a set of curricular activities focused on enabling safe and evidence-based nursing practice through the use of information technology. Principal components factor analysis resulted in three factors (ease of use and usefulness, clinical support, and barriers to use) that explained 55.49% of the variance. Internal consistency reliability estimates ranged from .61 to .82. Factor scores did not discriminate between nursing students who owned a PDA and those who did not. There were no significant changes in factors scores over time (responsiveness). This study provides preliminary evidence for the factorial structure of the Handheld Decision Support Software Scale and internal consistency of two of the three factor scales. Further exploration of the construct validity, internal consistency, and responsiveness is warranted.",

Frequent handoffs of patient care, high acuity of patient illness, and the increasing amount of available data complicate information exchange.

We aimed to understand the current patterns and perceptions of communication of common goals in the ICU using the distributed cognition and clinical communication space theoretical frameworks. We conducted a focus group and 5 interviews with ICU clinicians and observed 59.5 hours of interdisciplinary ICU morning rounds. Clinicians used a CIS/CPOE system and paper artifacts for documentation; yet, preferred verbal communication as a method of information exchange because they perceived that the documentation was often not updated or efficient for information retrieval. These perceptions that the CIS/CPOE is a \"shift behind\" may lead to a further reliance on verbal information exchange, which is a valuable clinical communication activity, yet, is subject to information loss. Electronic documentation tools that, in real time, capture information that is currently verbally communicated may increase the effectiveness of communication.",

Most participants expressed a desire for participation in shared decision making. Being Hispanic was significantly associated with a more passive role in decision making. Participants preferred more involvement in decision making versus problem solving tasks for both mental and general health vignettes, and more involvement in mental health versus general health decision-making. More research is needed to confirm tentative results on the influence of sociodemographic variables on preferences for role and participation in treatment decision making and the variation in these preferences. Treatment seeking individuals with anxiety and depression have identifiable preferences for participation in decision making. Asking about patient preferences and a better understanding of variability in preferences may improve patient-provider communication.",

The 25-week clinical rotations included 2 days per week for 5 weeks each in community, medical-surgical, obstetrics, pediatrics, and psychiatric settings. During a 3-year period, 453 students made 21,276 reports. Of the 10,206 positive (yes) responses to a hazard or near miss, 6,005 hazards (59%) and 4,200 near misses (41%) were reported. The most common reports were related to infection, medication, environmental, fall, and equipment issues. Of the near misses, 1,996 (48%) had planned interceptions and 2,240 (52%) had unplanned interceptions. Types of hazards and near misses varied by rotation. Incorporating hazard and near-miss reporting into the patient safety curriculum was an innovative strategy to promote mindfulness among nursing students.",

This hampers the ability of others to assess the fit of a clinical informatics intervention with demonstrated efficacy in one setting for implementation in their setting. The objective of this model formulation paper is to demonstrate the applicability of the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework with proposed extensions to clinical informatics intervention research and describe the framework's role in facilitating the translation of evidence into practice and generation of evidence from practice. Both aspects are essential to reap the clinical and public health benefits of clinical informatics research.",

The study findings provide evidence that integration of a decision support feature that automatically calculates an obesity-related diagnosis increases diagnoses and decreases missed diagnoses and suggest that such systems have the potential to improve the quality of obesity-related care.",

Combined BS/MS nursing students (N=336) completed the 93-item scale, which was based upon published and locally-developed nursing informatics competency statements. Exploratory principal component analysis with oblique promax rotation extracted five factors comprising 30 items that explained 63.7% of the variance: clinical informatics role (alpha=.91), basic computer knowledge and skills (alpha=.94), applied computer skills: clinical informatics (alpha=.89), nursing informatics attitudes (alpha=.94), and wireless device skills (alpha=.90). Scale responsiveness was supported by significantly higher factor scores following an informatics course. This study provided preliminary evidence for the factor structure, internal consistency reliability and responsiveness of the 30-item SANICS. Further testing other samples is recommended.",

The purpose of the study was to explore case managers' perceptions of the barriers to adoption of the CCR. Focus group methodology was used to gather perceptions from 26 participants who provided direct case management services for persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in NYC. Question development was guided by models of technology acceptance. Data about the barriers to implementation of the system were classified into four main themes: client capacity for system adoption, potential breech of confidentiality, information quality concerns, and training needs. The four identified themes can serve as focal points for developers seeking to create EHI networks for the provision of HIV care.",

We used Morae software to record screen shots and study participants' (4 Nurse Managers, 3 Registered Nurses and 3 Patient Care Technicians) utterances during system use. Although features and functions used and patterns of use varied by role and individual, all participants found the system easy to use. Use of a particular function depended upon how effective the user perceived the function to be for the task that they wished to accomplish. User satisfaction was achieved when an effective function also allowed them to meet their task goal efficiently.",

        "Abstract": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers an approach for capturing data from narratives and creating structured reports for further computer processing. We explored the ability of a NLP system, Medical Language Extraction and Encoding (MedLEE), on nursing narratives. MedLEE extracted 490 concepts from narrative text in a sample of 553 oncology nursing process notes. The most frequently monitored and recorded signs and symptoms were related to chemotherapy care, such as adverse reactions, shortness of breath, nausea, pain, and bleeding. In terms of nursing interventions, chemotherapy, blood culture, medication, and blood transfusion were commonly recorded in free text. NLP may provide a feasible approach to extract data related to patient safety/quality measures and nursing outcomes by capturing nursing concepts that are not recorded through structured data entry. For better NLP performance in the domain of nursing, additional nursing terms and abbreviations must be added to MedLEE's lexicon.",

The methods resulted in user interface screens that were perceived to be easy to use, potentially useful, and well-matched to nursing documentation tasks associated with Nursing Admission Assessment, Blood Administration, and Nursing Discharge Summary. The methods applied in this research may serve as a guide for others wishing to implement user-centered processes to develop or extend EHR systems. In addition, some of the insights obtained in this study may be informative to the development of safe and efficient user interface screens for nursing document templates in EHRs.",

        "Abstract": "Public health is moving toward the goal of implementing evidence-based interventions. To accomplish this, there is a need to select, adapt, and evaluate intervention studies. Such selection relies, in part, on making judgments about the feasibility of possible interventions and determining whether comprehensive and multilevel evaluations are justified. There exist few published standards and guides to aid these judgments. This article describes the diverse types of feasibility studies conducted in the field of cancer prevention, using a group of recently funded grants from the National Cancer Institute. The grants were submitted in response to a request for applications proposing research to identify feasible interventions for increasing the utilization of the Cancer Information Service among underserved populations.",

        "Abstract": "The authors summarize their experience in iteratively testing the adequacy of three versions of the Health Level Seven (HL7) Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) Clinical Document Ontology (CDO) to represent document names at Columbia University Medical Center. The percentage of documents fully represented increased from 23.4% (Version 1) to 98.5% (Version 3). The proportion of unique representations increased from 7.9% (Analysis 1) to 39.4% (Analysis 4); the proportion reflects the level of specificity in the document names as well as the completeness and level of granularity of the CDO. The authors shared the findings of each analysis with the Clinical LOINC committee and participated in the decision-making regarding changes to the CDO on the basis of those analyses and those conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The authors encourage other institutions to actively engage in testing healthcare standards and participating in standards development activities to increase the likelihood that the evolving standards will meet institutional needs.",

We are extending the functionality of the system beyond reporting to Just-in-Time learning by providing context-specific links to internal and external information resources related to the type of hazard or near miss reported. As part of this process, 55 APN nursing students compared two different interfaces on ease of use and reported their perceptions of usefulness and intention to use the information resources links integrated into the HNMRS. The students demonstrated a significant preference for the Category-based Interface as compared to the Question-based Interface (p<.001). Mean scores for perceptions of usefulness and intention to use the context-specific links in the HNMRS for reference purposes reflected moderate to strong agreement.",

We found that heuristic evaluation performed by human-computer interaction (HCI) experts revealed more general interface design problems, while end-users' think-aloud protocols identified more obstacles to task performance. To provide the most effective and thorough evaluation results, a combination of heuristic evaluation and end-user think-aloud protocol is recommended.",

Such lists are used to capture and track patient care plan items, supporting daily workflow and collaborative patient management continuity across care transitions. While physician task lists have been shown to be important to patient safety, the tasks themselves have not been systematically examined for their subject matter, structure, or components. A manual sublanguage analysis of 500 signout tasks was conducted, and a hierarchical conceptual model for clinical tasks was inductively constructed. Tasks were classified by action type (Assess, Order, Communicate, Perform) and corresponding components. The most common task action types were Assess and Order. The most common task components were \"What\" type components such as Tests, including subtypes Laboratory and Imaging. This study yielded several important design considerations for future electronic health record systems that support collaborative clinical task management.",

As part of the Human Studies Database Project, we developed the Study Design Typology to standardize the classification of study designs in human research. We then performed a multiple observer masked evaluation of active research protocols in four institutions according to a standardized protocol. Thirty-five protocols were classified by three reviewers each into one of nine high-level study designs for interventional and observational research (e.g., N-of-1, Parallel Group, Case Crossover). Rater classification agreement was moderately high for the 35 protocols (Fleiss' kappa = 0.442) and higher still for the 23 quantitative studies (Fleiss' kappa = 0.463). We conclude that our typology shows initial promise for reliably distinguishing study design types for quantitative human research.",

        "Title": "Assessing the need for an online decision-support tool to promote evidence-based practices of psychosocial counseling in HIV care.",
        "Abstract": "Psychosocial counselors have a vital and challenging role in supporting persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH/A) to better manage their disease. However, gaps in training, education, and skills limit the effectiveness of counselors' efforts. We propose that the use of a decision-support tool for counselors at the point of care can support them in their work as well as help alleviate many training and practice gaps. Decision-support tools aimed at reducing knowledge and practice gaps are used extensively to assist clinical providers at the point of care; however, there is a need for decision-support tools designed specifically for HIV/AIDS counselors. To identify requirements for such a tool, we conducted a needs assessment through interviews of 19 HIV/AIDS clinic counselors who provide 20 or more hours per week of psychosocial support to PLWH/A. The assessment explored their education and training backgrounds, the extent to which evidence-based practices are implemented, and how a decision-support tool can support counselor work practices. Qualitative analysis was organized around seven main categories: counselor characteristics, patient characteristics, barriers, definitions of key concepts, use of guidelines, client assessments, and resources. The resulting coding schemes revealed knowledge and practice gaps among the interviewees, as well as barriers and challenges of counseling. Education and training background of the counseling staff varied widely. When asked to define five key concepts related to HIV counseling, 26-47% of respondents were unable to articulate an adequate definition. Less than half of the interviewees recalled sources of guidelines used in their work and specific models of care introduced during trainings. Interviews identified environmental barriers, language and literacy, patient education, and patient communication as the most prominent challenges to counseling work. The results from this study inform the need for and development of a decision-support tool to support the training and practices of HIV/AIDS counselors.",

        "Abstract": "Nurses information needs relate to nursing orders and nursing orders have many contexts including body systems, safety practices and other clinical categories. When searching for information related to orders one search term might retrieve documents related to multiple orders. We clustered nursing orders into sets that are related by the same logical clinical context. We then generated clusters and their search terms from a data set of 636 orders obtained from a CIS/CPOE system at an academic medical center. We refined those cluster search terms by searching an electronic nursing procedure manual to retrieve resources that could answer one of six generic nursing questions. Sixty-three cluster search terms were identified. The search terms for 100 (16%) of the orders were validated in a second hospitals electronic nursing procedure manual; precision was 32.5%.. Our process of identifying cluster search terms may be a useful method to obtain clinically relevant information resources.",

The Infobutton Manager (IM), accessed through a clinical information system, anticipates the clinician's questions and provides links to pertinent electronic resources. We conducted an observational usefulness case study of medical residents (MDs), nurse practitioners (NPs), registered nurses (RNs), and a physician assistant (PA), using the IM in a laboratory setting. Generic question types and success rates for each clinician's information needs were characterized. Question type frequency differed by clinician type. All clinician types asked for institution-specific protocols. The MDs asked about unfamiliar domains, RNs asked about physician order rationales, and NPs asked questions similar to both MDs and RNs. Observational data suggest that IM success rates may be improved by tailoring anticipated questions to clinician type. Clinicians reported that a more visible Infobutton may increase use.",

The authors focus on 3 specific aspects of context--genomic health care, shifting research paradigms, and social (Web 2.0) technologies--that must be considered in formulating a nursing informatics research agenda. These influences are illustrated using the significant issue of healthcare associated infections (HAI). A nursing informatics research agenda for 2008-18 must expand users of interest to include interdisciplinary researchers; build upon the knowledge gained in nursing concept representation to address genomic and environmental data; guide the reengineering of nursing practice; harness new technologies to empower patients and their caregivers for collaborative knowledge development; develop user-configurable software approaches that support complex data visualization, analysis, and predictive modeling; facilitate the development of middle-range nursing informatics theories; and encourage innovative evaluation methodologies that attend to human-computer interface factors and organizational context.",

        "Abstract": "Nurse information needs at the point of care exist; however, once provided with access to resources, nurses seek evidence-based answers. The success of answering an information need through an automated Infobutton relies on the program's ability to anticipate a clinician's question. This study's six process methodology aims to meet context-specific information needs related to clinical information system (CIS) nursing orders. Context-specific questions were derived from nurse generic questions generated from nurse focus group data, observational data, and an established taxonomy. The context-specific questions, were filtered by nursing order semantic type within a logical clinical context cluster (LCCC), which is a clinical association identified from the nurse perspective. Nursing orders of the same semantic type are associated with similar types of nurse information needs and are used to assess Internet-based resources for the capability to answer those information needs. LCCCs help identify resources and CIS areas ripe for an Infobutton.",

Published research has discussed attitudes about interdisciplinary work and organizational resources but not the needed competencies. This report describes the method and results of the competency specification process for health research. Based on an established definition of interdisciplinary research, a preliminary set of competencies was developed from expert opinion of key informants and a review of the interdisciplinary research literature. A Delphi panel of interdisciplinary researchers then reached consensus on 17 competencies necessary for interdisciplinary research.",

        "Abstract": "Over the last 15 years, evidence has been accumulating relating higher levels of nurse staffing in both quantity and experience to lower rates of adverse patient outcomes. Consequently, to promote quality patient outcomes efficiently, making staffing decisions based in evidence is of increasing importance. However, there is still limited data to help decide how to effectively allocate scarce nurse resources in practice. Existing principles, frameworks, and guidelines provide a foundation for nurse staffing decisions but face poor adoption. To determine optimal nurse staffing practices and provide evidence-based recommendations for policy, and integration into operations, comprehensive data are necessary. Information technology can assist nurse staffing decisions. Four informatics processes that may support evidence-based nurse staffing are described: (a) Data acquisition from multiple data sources, (b) Representation of data in a way it can be re-used for multiple purposes, (c) Sophisticated data processing and mining, and (d) Presentation of data in standardized and user-configurable ways.",

The research setting was an urban/suburban county health department with 156 employees. The goal of the research was to study communication and information flow in the department and to assess the technique for public health management. Network data were derived from survey questionnaires. Computational analysis was performed with the Organizational Risk Analyzer. Analysis revealed centralized communication, limited interdependencies, potential knowledge loss through retirement, and possible informational silos. The findings suggested opportunities for more cross program coordination but also suggested the presences of potentially efficient communication paths and potentially beneficial social connectedness. Managers found the findings useful to support decision making. Public health organizations must be effective in an increasingly complex environment. Network analysis can help build public health capacity for complex system management.",

        "Abstract": "Recently there has been a proliferation of interactive tailored patient assessment (ITPA) tools. However, evidence of the reliability and validity of these instruments is often missing, which makes their value in research studies questionable. Because several of the common methods to evaluate instrument reliability and validity are not applicable to interactive tailored patient assessments, informatics researchers may benefit from some guidance on which methods of reliability and validity assessment they can appropriately use. This paper describes the main differences between interactive tailored patient assessments and assessment instruments based on psychometric, or classical test, theory; it summarizes the measurement techniques normally used to ascertain the validity and reliability of assessment instruments based on psychometric theory; it discusses which methods are appropriate for interactive tailored patient assessments and which are not; and finally, it illustrates the application of some of the feasible techniques with a case study that describes how the reliability and validity of the tailored symptom assessment instrument called Choice were evaluated.",

The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and initial evaluation of a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based decision support system (DSS) for pediatric depression screening in ages 8 to 18 years of age by pediatric advanced practice nurse (APN) students. Three aspects are described: selection of depression screening instrument; integration of the instrument into the PDA; and quantitative (usage) and qualitative (focus group) evaluation. Only one third of eligible patients were screened. Twenty percent of those screened were identified as at risk for mood disorder. The barriers to screening identified through focus groups included a lack of time, knowledge, intervention protocol, referral resources, PDA usability issues, preceptor motivation and comfort, as well as perceived or real cultural barriers. Suggestions for educational, research, and interventions to integrate clinical based PDA-based screening are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Interest in studying distractions and interruptions in the context of clinician workflow has increased in light of evidence that these events may negatively impact patient safety. Additionally, many recent informatics-based studies analyze computer provider order entry (CPOE) and clinical information system (CIS) implementation and its effects on clinician workflow. This study expands the development and use of a taxonomy to characterize distractions to clinicians and their subsequent actions in the context of CPOE/CIS use. We found a total of 75 distracting events in 406 minutes of observational data of which 32 led to interruptions and 30 led to continued multitasking. The above primary actions led to 5 tasks not completed and 4 episodes of clinician's lack of recall. Differences in the distribution of the source of distractions and primary action of the distracted clinicians may be a function of clinical setting and clinician type using the CPOE/CIS. Nine secondary actions, potentially resulting in a slip or a mistake, suggest that CPOE may necessitate different forms of safety nets than traditional clinician communication.",

To promote mindfulness during clinical education for entry-level nurses, we developed a web-based dangerous situation and near miss reporting system for a cohort of baccalaureate nursing students (N=156). For this curricular innovation project, we provided wireless handheld devices to students who were required to submit one report for each of their clinical days in the medical-surgical, pediatric, psychiatric, obstetrics and community settings. During a ten-week period, students submitted 1487 reports. Of these, 63% were dangerous situations and 37% were near misses. The most frequently occurring dangerous situations were poor infection control practices. The most commonly reported near misses were medication errors. Free text comments from students identified inadequate patient identification and poor documentation as commonly occurring dangerous situations observed.",

In order to use CPGs effectively at the point of care, representing CPGs into computer-interpretable format is essential. Since computer-interpretable guidelines (CIGs) have been reported to increase clinicians' usage of guidelines and improve patient's outcomes, it is critical to assess health care knowledge translated from CPGs into CIGs.

Compliance with use of the automated instrument increased from 43% to 78% on units that did not have complete electronic nursing documentation. Units in which the instrument was integrated into the daily shift assessment, had 99-100% compliance. Further analysis will explore association of compliance with fall and injury rates.",

In order for clinical information to be shared, consistent formal naming principles for document components are desired. The purposes of this study were 1) to identify the components of existing electronic nursing documents, and 2) to represent them with Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC) semantic model to examine the sufficiency of LOINC for non-ambiguously defining nursing document components as a prerequisite step toward the creation of an ontology for nursing document components. Section headings (n=308) were retrieved from the Eclipsys CIS; 38% were successfully represented with an inter-rater reliability of 0.73. Inconsistency exists in the names of the current section headings. In order for LOINC to better represent the document components, currently missing nursing section headings need to be added and extension of the attributes is desired.",

In this paper, we report an evaluation of the usefulness of a PDA-based advanced practice nursing (APN) student clinical log through faculty stakeholder exemplars in three areas: pediatric asthma care; procedures of Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (NP) students; and diagnostic and screening procedures of Women's Health NP students. We generated descriptive data through routine queries and through custom SQL queries at the request of a specific faculty member who wished to examine a particular aspect of an educational program. In addition, we discussed the potential implications of the data with the respective faculty members. The exemplars provide evidence that faculty stakeholders found the APN student clinical log to be useful for a variety of purposes including monitoring of student performance, benchmarking, and quality of care assessments.",

Mapping each local document name to standard document ontology may enable health care professionals to navigate and retrieve documents efficiently for multiple purposes such as quality assurance, outcomes research or public health reporting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sufficiency of the Health Level 7 (HL7)/Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC) document ontology for representing nursing document names. We collected 94 nursing document types from the Eclipsys Clinical Information System (CIS) and the Columbia Medical Entities Dictionary (MED) and mapped them to the components of the HL7/LOINC document ontology. Seventy-five (79.8%) nursing document names were completely represented and 19 (20.2%) document names were partially represented. In order for the HL7/LOINC document ontology to be of more use in implementing EHRs that support nursing documentation, Subject Matter Domain and Type of Service axes require extension and clarification.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are intended to provide evidence based knowledge for decision making for patient care. However, these guidelines have been poorly adopted by healthcare providers. One reason for this may be the static paper-based formats, isolated from the point of care. Biomedical informatics has provided a solution to this limitation through Computer Interpretable Guidelines (CIGs). An essential component of this process is CPG translation to a computer interpretable model. From the guideline modeling literature, the translators of CPGs typically are physicians. It is not known if other healthcare providers (i.e., Advance Practice Nurses [APNs]) comprehend CPGs similarly. This descriptive study utilized novice and expert APN and physician participants (varied by level of expertise) in a CPG comprehension task. Demographic data, verbal protocols, and recall model drawings were obtained and analyzed by description, protocol analysis, discourse analysis, and content analysis. The findings of this study indicate similar comprehension by the expert APNs and physicians suggesting that either type of expert may be utilized for modeling CPGs.",

        "Abstract": "Many studies have found that clinicians require access to medical knowledge sources while viewing data in their patients' health records. To address this need, we have been developing links to various on-line health information resources from our Web-based clinical information system (WebCIS). Clinicians can access these resources through a \"Health Resources\" Web page or use context-sensitive \"infobuttons\" that automatically link to specific resources. To assist in understanding how clinicians interact with these two mechanisms, we have been exploring the use of an automated approach to answer questions about usage for guiding the further development of links to resources. In this paper, we discuss the use of a knowledge discovery technique (CIS Usage Mining) to obtain usage statistics from log files that record interactions with health resources and infobuttons in WebCIS, describe a Web-based interface developed to present the results, and summarize how the results could be applied. The availability of effective links to on-line medical knowledge sources from the patient health record can assist in resolving information needs, potentially improving patient care and decision-making.",

        "Abstract": "\"Web-based Educational Resources for the NICU Parent,\" an educational website for low literacy families, was developed and implemented as prototype web pages using Macromedia Dreamweaver MX. Research has shown that evaluating a website before its implementation can reduce usability errors and improve the overall interface design. As an initial assessment of the website's interface, a heuristic evaluation was conducted with a sample of three usability experts. The usability experts reviewed the website with typical case scenario and completed an evaluation form covering ten usability heuristics. The task was completed in approximately one and a half hours; 82 heuristic violations were reported. The heuristic violations noted on the evaluation forms and the experts' verbalizations captured by a usability testing tool (Morae) were content analyzed and categorized based on the potential design solutions to be implemented: function, design and layout, content, and navigation. Approximately 88% of the violations were resolved by implementing these solutions. The study findings suggest that the heuristic evaluation was an efficient and inexpensive method for evaluating the low literacy interface of the \"Web-based Educational Resources for the NICU Parent.\"",

The following study employed usability engineering methods via a series of focus groups, to specify functional and design requirements for an automated Fall-Injury Risk Assessment Instrument. Focus groups were held with interdisciplinary decision makers and end-users to identify functional and design specifications for the automated instrument. The results were mapped to usability heuristics, which were used to guide design decisions. The main elements identified were data completeness, workflow processes, resource access, and cognitive burden. The main usability factors identified were efficiency of user, match with real world, error prevention, recognition not recall and minimalist design. Focus groups are a useful methodology to specify requirements for healthcare applications. Outcomes evaluation of the automated instrument is in process.",

The data that were documented by APN students with the CL-APN were retrieved using the Structured Query Language (SQL) and were compared to the CPG using a scoring tool developed for this study. Only 1.4 % of the encounters had obesity as an assessment diagnosis and about 40 % of those encounters did not have any plans of care related to the CPG's main treatment recommendations. Fifty-six concepts related to the screening and management of obesity were extracted from the CPG and were mapped to 36 terms using standardized terminologies.",

In order to use CPGs effectively at the point of care, representing CPGs into computer-interpretable format is essential. Since computer-interpretable guidelines (CIGs) have been reported to increase clinicians' usage of guidelines and improve patient's outcomes, it is critical to validate health care knowledge translated from CPGs into CIGs. A comprehensive method of developing and evaluating a gold standard for a depression screening CIG was performed and analyzed in this study. GLIF encoding was conducted for a depression screening CPG and 21 clinical scenarios were created based on the encoded depression screening CIG. Two nurse practitioners were recruited to generate initial management for each scenario. Proficiency and efficiency scores were calculated for each scenario. In 13 of 21 scenarios, both experts had proficiency scores of 100%. Proficiency scores were lowest for scenarios that included bipolar disease. Implications of our findings for development of a gold standard are discussed.",

Public health agencies depend on specialized information that travels throughout an organization via communication networks among employees. Interactions that occur within these networks are poorly understood and are generally unmanaged. We applied organizational network analysis, a method for studying communication networks, to assess the method's utility to support decision making for public health managers, and to determine what links existed between information use and agency processes. Data on communication links among a health department's staff was obtained via survey with a 93% response rate, and analyzed using Organizational Risk Analyzer (ORA) software. The findings described the structure of information flow in the department's communication networks. The analysis succeeded in providing insights into organizational processes which informed public health managers' strategies to address problems and to take advantage of network strengths.",

        "Abstract": "In Crossing the Quality Chasm, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committee on Quality of Health Care in America identified the critical role of information technology in designing a health system that produces care that is \"safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable\" (Committee on Quality of Health Care in America, 2001, p. 164). A subsequent IOM report contends that improved information systems are essential to a new health care delivery system that \"both prevents errors and learns from them when they occur\" (Committee on Data Standards for Patient Safety, 2004, p. 1). This review specifically highlights the role of informatics processes and information technology in promoting patient safety and summarizes relevant nursing research. First, the components of an informatics infrastructure for patient safety are described within the context of the national framework for delivering consumer-centric and information-rich health care and using the National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) (Thompson & Brailer, 2004). Second, relevant nursing research is summarized; this includes research studies that contributed to the development of selected infrastructure components as well as studies specifically focused on patient safety. Third, knowledge gaps and opportunities for nursing research are identified for each main topic. The health information technologies deployed as part of the national framework must support nursing practice in a manner that enables prevention of medical errors and promotion of patient safety and contributes to the development of practice-based nursing knowledge as well as best practices for patient safety. The seminal work that has been completed to date is necessary, but not sufficient, to achieve this objective.",

        "Abstract": "Medical logic modules are a procedural representation for sharing task-specific knowledge for decision support systems. Based on the premise that clinicians may perceive object-oriented expressions as easier to read than procedural rules in Arden Syntax-based medical logic modules, we developed a method for improving the readability of medical logic modules. Two approaches were applied: exploiting the concept-oriented features of the Medical Entities Dictionary and building an executable Java program to replace Arden Syntax procedural expressions. The usability evaluation showed that 66% of participants successfully mapped all Arden Syntax rules to Java methods. These findings suggest that these approaches can play an essential role in the creation of human readable medical logic modules and can potentially increase the number of clinical experts who are able to participate in the creation of medical logic modules.

The technique is grounded in social science theory, and employs calculations derived from graph theory to generate statistical and graphical models from relational data matrices. For this pilot we will develop network models to characterize how information use in routine work contributes to the agency's performance goals. This is the first step in ongoing work that will extend network analysis with computational methods, to predict the potential effects that improving information use has on the agency's performance.",

This paper focuses on one aspect of the Health Level 7 (HL7)/ Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC) DO, the Subject Matter Domain (SMD). We created a new polyhierarchical structure for the SMD that combines the current value lists from the LOINC database with another value list from the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). We refined and evaluated the new structure through expert review of the ontology, a survey of medical specialty boards, and specification of SMDs for a corpus of clinical notes.",

        "Abstract": "Online medical information, when presented to clinicians, must be well-organized and intuitive to use, so that the clinicians can conduct their daily work efficiently and without error. It is essential to actively seek to produce good user interfaces that are acceptable to the user. This paper describes the methodology used to develop a simplified heuristic evaluation (HE) suitable for the evaluation of screen shots of Web pages, the development of an HE instrument used to conduct the evaluation, and the results of the evaluation of the aforementioned screen shots. In addition, this paper presents examples of the process of categorizing problems identified by the HE and the technological solutions identified to resolve these problems. Four usability experts reviewed 18 paper-based screen shots and made a total of 108 comments. Each expert completed the task in about an hour. We were able to implement solutions to approximately 70% of the violations. Our study found that a heuristic evaluation using paper-based screen shots of a user interface was expeditious, inexpensive, and straightforward to implement.",

        "Abstract": "HEART Failure Effectiveness & Leadership Team (HEARTFELT) is a multifaceted intervention designed to improve adherence with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association practice guidelines for heart failure (HF). The purpose of this study was to assess differences in clinician adherence with clinical practice guidelines before and after implementation of HEARTFELT. A quasi-experimental, untreated control group design with separate pretest/posttest samples was employed at a community hospital in Connecticut. The untreated historical control group included patients aged 65 years or older with HF and a nonequivalent comparison group of patients with stroke. The posttest samples included patients with the diagnosis of HF and stroke admitted after implementation of the HEARTFELT intervention. The HEARTFELT intervention included automated pathway in electronic medical record (order sets, interdisciplinary plan of care, self-management plan), access to evidence for clinicians and patients, HF self-management education tools, and ongoing discipline-specific feedback regarding adherence. Data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric methods. The HEARTFELT intervention significantly improved clinician adherence with addressing all self-management categories in the electronic medical record (P = .000) and adherence with self-management education given to the patient in writing at discharge (P = .000). There were no significant differences in adherence with medical interventions (P = .39). While guideline adherence is associated with less practice variation and improved processes, methods of integration into practice in community hospital settings have been largely unexplored. The multifaceted HEARTFELT intervention is promising for its potential to integrate evidence at the point of care, to reduce unwarranted variation in practice, and ultimately to improve the outcomes of individuals with HF.",

        "Abstract": "Effective and appropriate use of information and communication technologies is an essential competency for all health care professionals. The purpose of this paper is to describe the effect of an evolving informatics for evidence-based practice (IEBP) curriculum on nursing informatics competencies in three student cohorts in the combined BS/MS program for non-nurses at the Columbia University School of Nursing. A repeated-measures, non-equivalent comparison group design was used to determine differences in self-rated informatics competencies pre- and post-IEBP and between cohorts at the end of the BS year of the combined BS/MS program. The types of Computer Skill competencies on which the students rated themselves as competent (> or =3) on admission were generic in nature and reflective of basic computer literacy. Informatics competencies increased significantly from admission to BS graduation in all areas for the class of 2002 and in all, but three areas, for the class of 2003. None of the three cohorts achieved competence in Computer Skills: Education despite curricular revisions. There were no significant differences between classes at the end of the BS year. Innovative educational approaches, such as the one described in this paper demonstrate promise as a method to achieve informatics competence. It is essential to integrate routine measurement of informatics competency into the curriculum so that approaches can be refined as needed to ensure informatics competent graduates.",

        "Abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) systems have demonstrated utility in parsing narrative texts for purposes such as surveillance and decision support. However, there has been little work related to NLP of nursing narratives. The purpose of this study was to compare the semantic categories of a NLP system (Medical Language Extraction and Encoding [MedLEE] system) with the semantic domains, categories, and attributes of the International Standards Organization (ISO) reference terminology models for nursing diagnoses and nursing actions. All but two MedLEE diagnosis and procedure-related semantic categories mapped to ISO models. In some instances, we found exact correspondence between the semantic structures of MedLEE and the ISO models. In other situations (e.g. aspects of Site or Location), the ISO model was not as granular as MedLEE. For clinical procedure and non-invasive examination, two ISO nursing action model components (Action and Target) mapped to a single MedLEE semantic category. The ISO models are applicable to NLP of nursing narratives. However, the ISO models require additional specification of selected semantic categories for the abstract semantic domains in order to achieve the objective of using NLP to parse and encode data from nursing narratives. Our analysis also suggests areas for extension of MedLEE particularly in regard to represent nursing actions.",

        "Abstract": "Home telehealth involves the use of video conferencing or remote monitoring equipment in patients' homes. The installation of hardware and training of patients has historically been performed by nurses, typically RNs. This article examines the experience of RNs as telehealth installers in the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) project, where RNs were responsible for the installation of the Home Telemedicine Units (HTUs) and for training patients in the use of the HTUs, blood pressure cuffs, and fingerstick glucose meters. Average installation and training time was 166 minutes (SD 51 min). Structured interviews with RN installers revealed that patient education and training accounted for roughly two thirds of the in-home time. Technology-related problems, especially those related to telecommunications, were the primary cause of installation difficulties. Thematic analysis of installer interviews identified eight major themes and confirmed the importance of both clinical and technical knowledge during the telehealth installation process.",

Variation in practice is recognized as a key barrier to promoting positive outcomes in patients with cardiac illness. Implementation of clinical practice guidelines has been identified as one way to promote evidence-based practice, reduce practice variation, and ultimately improve the quality of care and outcomes of cardiac patients. Improving patient knowledge and understanding of guideline recommendations and the ways in which evidence-based recommendations are linked to recovery is recognized as one means of facilitating guideline adherence. Automated patient pathways are proposed as a means to improve patient access to guideline-based information at the point of care. Within this context, the prototype development of a Patient Education And Recovery Learning System, or PEARLS, is discussed along with the potential benefits of the use of automated patient pathways as one means for overcoming challenges associated with acute care patient education and facilitating patient adherence to clinical practice guideline recommendations.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between acculturation level and perceptions of health access, Chinese health beliefs, Chinese health practices, and knowledge of breast cancer risk. This descriptive, correlational cross-sectional study used a survey approach. The sample included 135 Chinese women from the New York City metropolitan area. Data were analyzed using correlational techniques and polytomous regression. There were no significant relationships between acculturation and health access, Chinese health beliefs, Chinese health practices, and breast cancer risk knowledge. Only \"years of education,\" \"marital status,\" and \"household income\" significantly predicted breast cancer risk knowledge level. The data indicate that women with a better knowledge of breast cancer risk are twice as likely to have higher income and have more education. The most knowledgeable women are less likely to be married and less likely to have partners compared to least knowledgeable group. Providers need to promote health knowledge and provide information about as well as access to preventive health practices to the immigrant population, given that acculturation to the new dominant society is inevitable.",

        "Abstract": "The vision for national and regional health information infrastructures (HII) includes provision of a framework that is supportive of access and integration of health information with the goal of improving the health and safety of individuals, public health systems, and nations. Internationally, prominent examples of national and regional HIIs exist that provide a means for achievement of this goal. However, to fully realize benefits, an explicit mechanism is needed for linking national and regional HIIs with existing knowledge, automated processes and evaluation of the ability of HIIs to meet the information needs of primary recipients. Using the United States' Na-tion Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) as an example, the authors describe expansion of the conceptual framework to explicitly acknowledge the role of access to evidence at the overlap between the three dimensions of the NHII to create an \"evidence-based\" link between interrelated components. The role of national measures in setting e-communication goals and evaluating the evolving infrastructure in meeting informational needs of users is discussed. Additionally, automated knowledge management tools such as practice guidelines are presented as a means by which access to critical information is delivered to users, in a format that is appropriate for their health literacy level and that provides adequate support for informed decision making.",

These challenges include: 1) the identification and/or development of valid and reliable instruments; 2) adequate representation of key safety concepts, constructs, and associated concepts in the clinical information system; and 3) identification of data sources for instrument pre-population. As part of a larger project aimed at identifying and addressing the information needs of clinicians while using a clinical information system, an electronic fall and injury risk assessment instrument is in development to address a hospital-based fall and injury prevention initiative. The concepts contained in the instrument are well represented by Clinical LOINC and the UMLS. Associated concepts have been identified in the existing clinical information system data dictionary for pre-population of the instrument.",

        "Abstract": "The benefits of structured data are widely accepted within the nursing informatics community. However, despite the existence of structured data in the form of well-established nursing terminologies, computer-based nursing record systems are yet to achieve widespread adoption and few of the potential benefits have yet to be realized. In this paper we argue the need for tools and techniques to support the entry of structured nursing data into computer-based systems. In the absence of a generally accepted solution, we build on preliminary work carried out at the 2002 Nursing Terminology Summit and analyze the results of other studies in order to identify a preliminary set of requirements or desiderata for such tools and techniques. These requirements are centered on: how structured data is presented to users for selection; how to mediate between a variety of conceptual structures--terminologies, information models, user interface models and models of the clinical process; and how to reduce the considerable modeling burden through reuse of modeling constructs. Further applied research is needed with the ultimate goal of developing a general solution that will benefit nurses, other professionals and ultimately their patients.",

        "Abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) systems have demonstrated utility in parsing narrative texts for purposes such as surveillance and decision support. However, there has been little work related to NLP of nursing narratives. The purpose of this study was to compare the semantic categories of a NLP system (Medical Language Extraction and Encoding [MedLEE] system) with the semantic domains, categories, and attributes of the International Standards Organization(ISO) reference terminology models for nursing diagnoses and nursing actions. All but two MedLEE diagnosis and procedure-related semantic categories mapped to ISO models. In some instances, we found exact correspondence between the semantic structures of MedLEE and the ISO models. In other situations (e.g. aspects of site or location), the ISO model was not as granular as MedLEE. For clinical procedure and non-invasive examination, two ISO nursing action model components (action and target) were required to represent the MedLEE semantic category. The ISO model requires additional specification of selected semantic categories for the abstract semantic domains in order to achieve the objective of using NLP to parse and encode data from nursing narratives. Our analysis also suggests areas for extension of MedLEE.",

        "Abstract": "The AMIA 2003 Spring Congress entitled \"Bridging the Digital Divide: Informatics and Vulnerable Populations\" convened 178 experts including medical informaticians, health care professionals, government leaders, policy makers, researchers, health care industry leaders, consumer advocates, and others specializing in health care provision to underserved populations. The primary objective of this working congress was to develop a framework for a national agenda in information and communication technology to enhance the health and health care of underserved populations. Discussions during four tracks addressed issues and trends in information and communication technologies for underserved populations, strategies learned from successful programs, evaluation methodologies for measuring the impact of informatics, and dissemination of information for replication of successful programs. Each track addressed current status, ideal state, barriers, strategies, and recommendations. Recommendations of the breakout sessions were summarized under the overarching themes of Policy, Funding, Research, and Education and Training. The general recommendations emphasized four key themes: revision in payment and reimbursement policies, integration of health care standards, partnerships as the key to success, and broad dissemination of findings including specific feedback to target populations and other key stakeholders.",

In addition to technical aspects such as regional or national health information infrastructures, to achieve this goal, healthcare professionals must receive the requisite training during basic and advanced educational programs. In this article, we describe a two-pronged strategy to promote patient safety through an informatics-based approach to nursing education at the Columbia University School of Nursing: (1) use of a personal digital assistant (PDA) to document clinical encounters and to retrieve patient safety-related information at the point of care, and (2) enhancement of informatics competencies of students and faculty. These approaches may be useful to others wishing to promote patient safety through using informatics methods and technologies in healthcare curricula.",

A number of decisions are necessary to evaluate the appropriateness of different health measurement instruments. These include: whether the purpose is to evaluate a program of care or to study individual patients; characteristics that are being assessed; the time frame being assessed; how broad-ranging an assessment is desired; and the scope of detail that is desired. This descriptive survey with a HIV+ sample (N = 100) found that there were 8 items that assessed identical symptoms on the Sign and Symptom Checklist-HIV and the HIV Assessment Tool. There were no significant correlations between similar items on the two instruments. There were significant differences between the mean scores only for headaches (t = -3.4, p = .001). Issues related to symptom appraisal, the time frame, and the nature of symptom-related variables need to be carefully considered before choosing a measurement instrument.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, significant progress has been achieved toward increased structured data entry using standardized health care terminologies. Concurrently, the value of narrative as the clinician's rich description of the encounter and source of vital information has been reaffirmed. Natural language processing (NLP) offers a strategy for integrating these approaches to provide structured reports for further computer processing. As part of a larger project aimed at using narrative data to enrich the online medical record, we analyzed a small sample of documents in a corpus of progress notes to identify potential challenges associated with using NLP for HIV/AIDS clinic notes. We provide illustrative examples of five types of challenges.",

        "Abstract": "Medical errors are often associated with inadequate cognitive processing that is based upon impaired access to information.1 Understanding the information needs of nurses and physicians' when using a clinical information system (CIS) is difficult largely because there are few systematic attempts made to do so. We collected 15.5 hours of data of nurses and physicians' CIS interactions in three clinical environments (cardiac ICU, a general medical/surgical nursing, and an ambulatory clinic). We accomplished this through observational, cognitive-based methods (e.g., thinking aloud during interaction) and the video capturing of events with a portable usability laboratory.2 We developed a systematic approach to identify and define in-context clinical information needs while using a CIS, and determine how to categorize and code such events. 3",

Using a repeated-measures, non-equivalent control group design, self-reported informatics competencies were rated using a survey instrument based upon published informatics competencies for beginning nurses. For the class of 2002, scores increased significantly in all competencies from admission to graduation. Using a minimum score of 3 on a scale of 1=not competent and 5=expert to indicate competence, the only area in which it was not achieved was Computer Skills: Education. For 2001 graduates, Computer Skills: Decision Support was also below 3. There were no significant differences in competency scores between 2001 and 2002 graduates. Computer Skills: Decision Support neared significance. Subsequently, the approaches were refined for implementation in the class of 2003.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, the Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC) Database has been expanded to include assessment items of relevance to nursing and in 2002 met the criteria for \"recognition\" by the American Nurses Association. Assessment measures in LOINC include those related to vital signs, obstetric measurements, clinical assessment scales, assessments from standardized nursing terminologies, and research instruments. In order for LOINC to be of greater use in implementing information systems that support nursing practice, additional content is needed. Moreover, those implementing systems for nursing practice must be aware of the manner in which LOINC codes for assessments can be appropriately linked with other aspects of the nursing process such as diagnoses and interventions. Such linkages are necessary to document nursing contributions to healthcare outcomes within the context of a multidisciplinary care environment and to facilitate building of nursing knowledge from clinical practice. The purposes of this paper are to provide an overview of the LOINC database, to describe examples of assessments of relevance to nursing contained in LOINC, and to illustrate linkages of LOINC assessments with other nursing concepts.",

        "Abstract": "Successfully addressing patient safety requires detecting medical events effectively. Given the volume of patients seen at medical centers, detecting events automatically from data that are already available electronically would greatly facilitate patient safety work. We have created a framework for electronic detection. Key steps include: selecting target events, assessing what information is available electronically, transforming raw data such as narrative notes into a coded format, querying the transformed data, verifying the accuracy of event detection, characterizing the events using systems and cognitive approaches, and using what is learned to improve detection.",

        "Abstract": "The importance of including patient preferences in decisions regarding their care has received increased emphasis over recent years. Medical informatics can play an important role in improving patient-centered care by developing decision support systems to support the inclusion of patient preferences in clinical decision making. However, development of such systems is a complex task that requires the integration of knowledge from four major research areas: (1) the clinical domain, for understanding of the decision problem, (2) decision science and research on shared decision making, to provide the theoretical underpinnings and techniques for eliciting patient preferences; (3) medical informatics, to provide the technology and algorithms for the collection, processing, structure, presentation and integration of patient preferences into patient care; and (4) organizational knowledge, to adapt the decision support system to the practices and work flows of clinicians and the organizational and professional context of the clinical practice settings. This paper describes a conceptual model comprising eight key components that are important to be considered in the development, implementation, and evaluation of decision support systems for shared decision making in patient care. The example of CHOICE, a decision support system to assist nurses in eliciting and integrating rehabilitation patients' preferences for functional performance in patient care is used to illustrate the eight components.",

        "Title": "Formal nursing terminology systems: a means to an end.",
        "Abstract": "In response to the need to support diverse and complex information requirements, nursing has developed a number of different terminology systems. The two main kinds of systems that have emerged are enumerative systems and combinatorial systems, although some systems have characteristics of both approaches. Differences in the structure and content of terminology systems, while useful at a local level, prevent effective wider communication, information sharing, integration of record systems, and comparison of nursing elements of healthcare information at a more global level. Formal nursing terminology systems present an alternative approach. This paper describes a number of recent initiatives and explains how these emerging approaches may help to augment existing nursing terminology systems and overcome their limitations through mediation. The development of formal nursing terminology systems is not an end in itself and there remains a great deal of work to be done before success can be claimed. This paper presents an overview of the key issues outstanding and provides recommendations for a way forward.",

        "Abstract": "We hypothesize that when clinicians review clinical data in an electronic medical record, the information needs that arise are predictable, based on a number of situational factors. Because our theory does not say, exactly, what those needs are, we are using an empirical approach (observation) to detecting and categorizing them. For each need, we can construct an \"infobutton\" that links the clinical data to an on-line information resource. We have constructed an Infobutton Manager to match the data being reviewed by clinicians with context-appropriate infobuttons. This paper describes how the theory, observations, and practical solutions can come together to improve clinician decision making by resolving information needs.",
