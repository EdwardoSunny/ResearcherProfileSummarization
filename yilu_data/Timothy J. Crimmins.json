        "Abstract": "Efficient appointment scheduling in the outpatient setting is challenged by two main factors: variability and uncertainty leading to undesirable wait times for patients or physician overtime, and events such as no-shows, cancellations, or walk-ins can result in physician idle time and under-utilization of resources. Some methods have been developed to optimize scheduling and minimize wait and idle times in the inpatient setting but are limited in the outpatient setting.",

To assist staff in focusing on techniques for improving EHR utilization, an optimization methodology was designed referencing the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) approach.",
