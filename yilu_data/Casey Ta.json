        "Abstract": "This study aims to promote interoperability in precision medicine and translational research by aligning the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) and Phenopackets data models. Phenopackets is an expert knowledge-driven schema designed to facilitate the storage and exchange of multimodal patient data, and support downstream analysis. The first goal of this paper is to explore model alignment by characterizing the common data models using a newly developed data transformation process and evaluation method. Second, using OMOP normalized clinical data, we evaluate the mapping of real-world patient data to Phenopackets. We evaluate the suitability of Phenopackets as a patient data representation for real-world clinical cases.",

        "Abstract": "Rare disease patients often endure prolonged diagnostic odysseys and may still remain undiagnosed for years. Selecting the appropriate genetic tests is crucial to lead to timely diagnosis. Phenotypic features offer great potential for aiding genomic diagnosis in rare disease cases. We see great promise in effective integration of phenotypic information into genetic test selection workflow. In this study, we present a phenotype-driven molecular genetic test recommendation (Phen2Test) for pediatric rare disease diagnosis. Phen2Test was constructed using frequency matrix of phecodes and demographic data from the EHR before ordering genetic tests, with the objective to streamline the selection of molecular genetic tests (whole-exome / whole-genome sequencing, or gene panels) for clinicians with minimum genetic training expertise. We developed and evaluated binary classifiers based on 1,005 individuals referred to genetic counselors for potential genetic evaluation. In the evaluation using the gold standard cohort, the model achieved strong performance with an AUROC of 0.82 and an AUPRC of 0.92. Furthermore, we tested the model on another silver standard cohort (n=6,458), achieving an overall AUROC of 0.72 and an AUPRC of 0.671. Phen2Test was adjusted to align with current clinical guidelines, showing superior performance with more recent data, demonstrating its potential for use within a learning healthcare system as a genomic medicine intervention that adapts to guideline updates. This study showcases the practical utility of phenotypic features in recommending molecular genetic tests with performance comparable to clinical geneticists. Phen2Test could assist clinicians with limited genetic training and knowledge to order appropriate genetic tests.",

Yet, the application of graph methodology is elusive due to the sheer number and complexity of knowledge sources. In addition, semantic incompatibilities hinder efforts to harmonize and integrate across these diverse sources. As part of The Biomedical Translator Consortium, we have developed a knowledge graph-based question-answering system designed to augment human reasoning and accelerate translational scientific discovery: the Translator system. We have applied the Translator system to answer biomedical questions in the context of a broad array of diseases and syndromes, including Fanconi anemia, primary ciliary dyskinesia, multiple sclerosis, and others. A variety of collaborative approaches have been used to research and develop the Translator system. One recent approach involved the establishment of a monthly \"Question-of-the-Month (QotM) Challenge\" series. Herein, we describe the structure of the QotM Challenge; the six challenges that have been conducted to date on drug-induced liver injury, cannabidiol toxicity, coronavirus infection, diabetes, psoriatic arthritis, and ",

        "Abstract": "Participant recruitment continues to be a challenge to the success of randomized controlled trials, resulting in increased costs, extended trial timelines and delayed treatment availability. Literature provides evidence that study design features (e.g., trial phase, study site involvement) and trial sponsor are significantly associated with recruitment success. Principal investigators oversee the conduct of clinical trials, including recruitment. Through a cross-sectional survey and a thematic analysis of free-text responses, we assessed the perceptions of sixteen principal investigators regarding success factors for participant recruitment. Study site involvement and funding source do not necessarily make recruitment easier or more challenging from the perspective of the principal investigators. The most commonly used recruitment strategies are also the most effort inefficient (e.g., in-person recruitment, reviewing the electronic medical records for prescreening). Finally, we recommended actionable steps, such as improving staff support and leveraging informatics-driven approaches, to allow clinical researchers to enhance participant recruitment.",

        "Title": "Biolink Model: A universal schema for knowledge graphs in clinical, biomedical, and translational science.",
        "Abstract": "Within clinical, biomedical, and translational science, an increasing number of projects are adopting graphs for knowledge representation. Graph-based data models elucidate the interconnectedness among core biomedical concepts, enable data structures to be easily updated, and support intuitive queries, visualizations, and inference algorithms. However, knowledge discovery across these \"knowledge graphs\" (KGs) has remained difficult. Data set heterogeneity and complexity; the proliferation of ad hoc data formats; poor compliance with guidelines on findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability; and, in particular, the lack of a universally accepted, open-access model for standardization across biomedical KGs has left the task of reconciling data sources to downstream consumers. Biolink Model is an open-source data model that can be used to formalize the relationships between data structures in translational science. It incorporates object-oriented classification and graph-oriented features. The core of the model is a set of hierarchical, interconnected classes (or categories) and relationships between them (or predicates) representing biomedical entities such as gene, disease, chemical, anatomic structure, and phenotype. The model provides class and edge attributes and associations that guide how entities should relate to one another. Here, we highlight the need for a standardized data model for KGs, describe Biolink Model, and compare it with other models. We demonstrate the utility of Biolink Model in various initiatives, including the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium and the Monarch Initiative, and show how it has supported easier integration and interoperability of biomedical KGs, bringing together knowledge from multiple sources and helping to realize the goals of translational science.",

        "Abstract": "Diagnosis for rare genetic diseases often relies on phenotype-driven methods, which hinge on the accuracy and completeness of the rare disease phenotypes in the underlying annotation knowledgebase. Existing knowledgebases are often manually curated with additional annotations found in published case reports. Despite their potential, real-world data such as electronic health records (EHRs) have not been fully exploited to derive rare disease annotations. Here, we present open annotation for rare diseases (OARD), a real-world-data-derived resource with annotation for rare-disease-related phenotypes. This resource is derived from the EHRs of two academic health institutions containing more than 10 million individuals spanning wide age ranges and different disease subgroups. By leveraging ontology mapping and advanced natural-language-processing (NLP) methods, OARD automatically and efficiently extracts concepts for both rare diseases and their phenotypic traits from billing codes and lab tests as well as over 100 million clinical narratives. The rare disease prevalence derived by OARD is highly correlated with those annotated in the original rare disease knowledgebase. By performing association analysis, we identified more than 1 million novel disease-phenotype association pairs that were previously missed by human annotation, and >60% were confirmed true associations via manual review of a list of sampled pairs. Compared to the manual curated annotation, OARD is 100% data driven and its pipeline can be shared across different institutions. By supporting privacy-preserving sharing of aggregated summary statistics, such as term frequencies and disease-phenotype associations, it fills an important gap to facilitate data-driven research in the rare disease community.",

The purpose of this research is to present a classification model that identifies delirium using retrospective EHR data. Delirium was confirmed with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Age, sex, Elixhauser comorbidity index, drug exposures, and diagnoses were used as features. The model was developed based on the Columbia University Irving Medical Center EHR data and further validated with the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III dataset. Seventy-six patients from Surgical/Cardiothoracic ICU were included in the model. The logistic regression model achieved the best performance in identifying delirium; mean AUC of 0.874\u2009\u00b1\u20090.033. The mean positive predictive value of the logistic regression model was 0.80. The model promises to identify delirium cases with EHR data, thereby enable a sustainable infrastructure to build a retrospective cohort of delirium.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical, biomedical, and translational science has reached an inflection point in the breadth and diversity of available data and the potential impact of such data to improve human health and well-being. However, the data are often siloed, disorganized, and not broadly accessible due to discipline-specific differences in terminology and representation. To address these challenges, the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium has developed and tested a pilot knowledge graph-based \"Translator\" system capable of integrating existing biomedical data sets and \"translating\" those data into insights intended to augment human reasoning and accelerate translational science. Having demonstrated feasibility of the Translator system, the Translator program has since moved into development, and the Translator Consortium has made significant progress in the research, design, and implementation of an operational system. Herein, we describe the current system's architecture, performance, and quality of results. We apply Translator to several real-world use cases developed in collaboration with subject-matter experts. Finally, we discuss the scientific and technical features of Translator and compare those features to other state-of-the-art, biomedical graph-based question-answering systems.",

In this paper, we propose a model to predict whether a patient infected with COVID-19 will develop severe outcomes based only on the patient's historical electronic health records (EHR) prior to hospital admission using recurrent neural networks. The model predicts risk score that represents the probability for a patient to progress into severe status (mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, or death) after being infected with COVID-19. The model achieved 0.846 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in predicting patients' outcomes averaged over 5-fold cross validation. While many of the existing models use features obtained after diagnosis of COVID-19, our proposed model only utilizes a patient's historical EHR to enable proactive risk management at the time of hospital admission.",

        "Abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has threatened the health of tens of millions of people worldwide and imposed heavy burden on global healthcare systems. In this paper, we propose a model to predict whether a patient infected with COVID-19 will develop severe outcomes based only on the patient's historical electronic health records (EHR) prior to hospital admission using recurrent neural networks. The model predicts risk score that represents the probability for a patient to progress into severe status (mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, or death) after being infected with COVID-19. The model achieved 0.846 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in predicting patients' outcomes averaged over 5-fold cross validation. While many of the existing models use features obtained after diagnosis of COVID-19, our proposed model only utilizes a patient's historical EHR to enable proactive risk management at the time of hospital admission.",

        "Abstract": "This special communication describes activities, products, and lessons learned from a recent hackathon that was funded by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences via the Biomedical Data Translator program ('Translator'). Specifically, Translator team members self-organized and worked together to conceptualize and execute, over a five-day period, a multi-institutional clinical research study that aimed to examine, using open clinical data sources, relationships between sex, obesity, diabetes, and exposure to airborne fine particulate matter among patients with severe asthma. The goal was to develop a proof of concept that this new model of collaboration and data sharing could effectively produce meaningful scientific results and generate new scientific hypotheses. Three Translator Clinical Knowledge Sources, each of which provides open access (via Application Programming Interfaces) to data derived from the electronic health record systems of major academic institutions, served as the source of study data. Jupyter Python notebooks, shared in GitHub repositories, were used to call the knowledge sources and analyze and integrate the results. The results replicated established or suspected relationships between sex, obesity, diabetes, exposure to airborne fine particulate matter, and severe asthma. In addition, the results demonstrated specific differences across the three Translator Clinical Knowledge Sources, suggesting cohort- and/or environment-specific factors related to the services themselves or the catchment area from which each service derives patient data. Collectively, this special communication demonstrates the power and utility of intense, team-oriented hackathons and offers general technical, organizational, and scientific lessons learned.",

Natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate automated phenotype extraction and thus improve the efficiency of curating clinical phenotypes from clinical texts. While individual NLP systems can perform well for a single cohort, an ensemble-based method might shed light on increasing the portability of NLP pipelines across different cohorts.",

        "Abstract": "Secondary analysis of electronic health records for clinical research faces significant challenges due to known data quality issues in health data observationally collected for clinical care and the data biases caused by standard healthcare processes. In this manuscript, we contribute methodology for data quality assessment by plotting domain-level (conditions (diagnoses), drugs, and procedures) aggregate statistics and concept-level temporal frequencies (i.e., annual prevalence rates of clinical concepts). We detect common temporal patterns in concept frequencies by normalizing and clustering annual concept frequencies using K-means clustering. We apply these methods to the Columbia University Irving Medical Center Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership database. The resulting domain-aggregate and cluster plots show a variety of patterns. We review the patterns found in the condition domain and investigate the processes that shape them. We find that these patterns suggest data quality issues influenced by system-wide factors that affect individual concept frequencies.",

        "Abstract": "Columbia Open Health Data (COHD) is a publicly accessible database of electronic health record (EHR) prevalence and co-occurrence frequencies between conditions, drugs, procedures, and demographics. COHD was derived from Columbia University Irving Medical Center's Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) database. The lifetime dataset, derived from all records, contains 36,578 single concepts (11,952 conditions, 12,334 drugs, and 10,816 procedures) and 32,788,901 concept pairs from 5,364,781 patients. The 5-year dataset, derived from records from 2013-2017, contains 29,964 single concepts (10,159 conditions, 10,264 drugs, and 8,270 procedures) and 15,927,195 concept pairs from 1,790,431 patients. Exclusion of rare concepts (count\u2009\u2264\u200910) and Poisson randomization enable data sharing by eliminating risks to patient privacy. EHR prevalences are informative of healthcare consumption rates. Analysis of co-occurrence frequencies via relative frequency analysis and observed-expected frequency ratio are informative of associations between clinical concepts, useful for biomedical research tasks such as drug repurposing and pharmacovigilance. COHD is publicly accessible through a web application-programming interface (API) and downloadable from the Figshare repository. The code is available on GitHub.",

        "Title": "Using Fluorescence Spectroscopy To Identify Milk from Grass-Fed Dairy Cows and To Monitor Its Photodegradation.",
        "Abstract": "Owing to its high \u03c9-3 fatty acid content, milk from grass-fed dairy cows is becoming increasingly more attractive to consumers. Consequently, it is important to identify the origins of such products and to measure their content, at least relative to some standard. To date, chromatography has been the most extensively used technique. Sample preparation and cost, however, often reduce its widespread applicability. Here, we report the effectiveness of fluorescence spectroscopy for such quantification by measuring the amount of chlorophyll metabolites in the sample. Their content is significantly higher for milk from grass-fed cows compared to milk from grain/silage-fed cows. It is 0.11-0.13 \u03bcM in milk samples from grass-fed cows, whereas in milk from cows fed grain/silage rations, the concentration was 0.01-0.04 \u03bcM. In various organic milk samples, the chlorophyll metabolite concentration was in the range of 0.07-0.09 \u03bcM. In addition, we explored the mechanisms of photodegradation of milk. Riboflavin and chlorophyll metabolites act as photosensitizers in milk for type-I and type-II reactions, respectively. It was also observed that the presence of high levels of chlorophyll metabolites can synergistically degrade riboflavin, contributing to the degradation of milk quality.",

        "Title": "Focal Liver Lesions: Computer-aided Diagnosis by Using Contrast-enhanced US Cine Recordings.",
        "Abstract": "Purpose To assess the performance of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems and to determine the dominant ultrasonographic (US) features when classifying benign versus malignant focal liver lesions (FLLs) by using contrast material-enhanced US cine clips. Materials and Methods One hundred six US data sets in all subjects enrolled by three centers from a multicenter trial that included 54 malignant, 51 benign, and one indeterminate FLL were retrospectively analyzed. The 105 benign or malignant lesions were confirmed at histologic examination, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and/or 6 or more months of clinical follow-up. Data sets included 3-minute cine clips that were automatically corrected for in-plane motion and automatically filtered out frames acquired off plane. B-mode and contrast-specific features were automatically extracted on a pixel-by-pixel basis and analyzed by using an artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) for CAD were compared with those for one experienced and one inexperienced blinded reader. A third observer graded cine quality to assess its effects on CAD performance. Results CAD, the inexperienced observer, and the experienced observer were able to analyze 95, 100, and 102 cine clips, respectively. The AUCs for the SVM, ANN, and experienced and inexperienced observers were 0.883 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.793, 0.940), 0.829 (95% CI: 0.724, 0.901), 0.843 (95% CI: 0.756, 0.903), and 0.702 (95% CI: 0.586, 0.782), respectively; only the difference between SVM and the inexperienced observer was statistically significant. Accuracy improved from 71.3% (67 of 94; 95% CI: 60.6%, 79.8%) to 87.7% (57 of 65; 95% CI: 78.5%, 93.8%) and from 80.9% (76 of 94; 95% CI: 72.3%, 88.3%) to 90.3% (65 of 72; 95% CI: 80.6%, 95.8%) when CAD was in agreement with the inexperienced reader and when it was in agreement with the experienced reader, respectively. B-mode heterogeneity and contrast material washout were the most discriminating features selected by CAD for all iterations. CAD selected time-based time-intensity curve (TIC) features 99.0% (207 of 209) of the time to classify FLLs, versus 1.0% (two of 209) of the time for intensity-based features. None of the 15 video-quality criteria had a statistically significant effect on CAD accuracy-all P values were greater than the Holm-Sidak \u03b1-level correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusion CAD systems classified benign and malignant FLLs with an accuracy similar to that of an expert reader. CAD improved the accuracy of both readers. Time-based features of TIC were more discriminating than intensity-based features. ",

        "Abstract": "An on-demand long-lived ultrasound contrast agent that can be activated with single pulse stimulated imaging (SPSI) has been developed using hard shell liquid perfluoropentane filled silica 500-nm nanoparticles for tumor ultrasound imaging. SPSI was tested on LnCAP prostate tumor models in mice; tumor localization was observed after intravenous (IV) injection of the contrast agent. Consistent with enhanced permeability and retention, the silica nanoparticles displayed an extended imaging lifetime of 3.3\u00b11 days (mean\u00b1standard deviation). With added tumor specific folate functionalization, the useful lifetime was extended to 12 \u00b1 2 days; in contrast to ligand-based tumor targeting, the effect of the ligands in this application is enhanced nanoparticle retention by the tumor. This paper demonstrates for the first time that IV injected functionalized silica contrast agents can be imaged with an in vivo lifetime ~500 times longer than current microbubble-based contrast agents. Such functionalized long-lived contrast agents may lead to new applications in tumor monitoring and therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Heat stress (HS) may result in economic losses to pig producers across the USA and worldwide. Despite significant advancements in management practices, HS continues to be a challenge. In this study, an in-feed antibiotic (carbadox, CBX) and antibiotic alternatives ( [XPC], and [SGX] fermentation products) were evaluated in a standard pig starter diet as mitigations against the negative effects of HS in pigs. A total of 100 gilts were obtained at weaning (6.87 \u00b1 0.82 kg BW, 19.36 \u00b1 0.72 d of age) and randomly assigned to dietary treatments (2 rooms/treatment, 2 pens/room, 6 to 7 pigs/pen). After 4 wk of dietary acclimation, half of the pigs in each dietary group (1 room/dietary treatment) were exposed to repeated heat stress conditions (RHS; daily cycles of 19 h at 25\u00b0C and 5 h at 40\u00b0C, repeated for 9 d), and the remaining pigs were housed at constant thermal neutral temperature (25\u00b0C, [NHS]). Pigs subjected to RHS had elevated skin surface temperature ( < 0.05; average 41.7\u00b0C) and respiration rate ( < 0.05; 199 breaths per minute (bpm) during HS, and overall reduced ( < 0.05) BW, ADG, ADFI, and G:F regardless of dietary treatment. Independent of diet, RHS pigs had significantly shorter ( < 0.05) jejunum villi on d 3 and d 9 compared to NHS pigs. Heat stress resulted in decreased villus height to crypt depth ratio (V:C) in pigs fed with control diet with no added feed additive (NON) and CBX diets at d 3, whereas the pigs fed diets containing XPC or SGX showed no decrease. Transcriptional expression of genes involved in cellular stress (, , , ), tight junction integrity (, , ), and immune response (, , and ) were measured in the ileum mucosa. Pigs in all dietary treatments subjected to RHS had significantly higher ( < 0.05) transcript levels of and , and an upward trend ( < 0.07) of mRNA expression. RHS pigs had higher ( < 0.05) transcript levels of and in NON diet, in XPC and CBX diets, and in SGX diet compared to the respective diet-matched pigs in the NHS conditions. Neither RHS nor diet affected peripheral natural killer () cell numbers or NK cell lytic activity. In conclusion, pigs subjected to RHS had decreased performance, and supplementation with fermentation products in the feed (XPC and SGX) protected pigs from injury to the jejunum mucosa.",

        "Abstract": "Ultrasound imaging is a safe, low-cost, and in situ method for detecting in vivo medical devices. A poly(methyl-2-cyanoacrylate) film containing 2 \u03bcm boron-doped, calcined, porous silica microshells was developed as an ultrasound imaging marker for multiple medical devices. A macrophase separation drove the gas-filled porous silica microshells to the top surface of the polymer film by controlled curing of the cyanoacrylate glue and the amount of microshell loading. A thin film of polymer blocked the wall pores of the microshells to seal air in their hollow core, which served as an ultrasound contrast agent. The ultrasound activity disappeared when curing conditions were modified to prevent the macrophase segregation. Phase segregated films were attached to multiple surgical tools and needles and gave strong color Doppler signals in vitro and in vivo with the use of a clinical ultrasound imaging instrument. Postprocessing of the simultaneous color Doppler and B-mode images can be used for autonomous identification of implanted surgical items by correlating the two images. The thin films were also hydrophobic, thereby extending the lifetime of ultrasound signals to hours of imaging in tissues by preventing liquid penetration. This technology can be used as a coating to guide the placement of implantable medical devices or used to image and help remove retained surgical items.",

        "Abstract": "Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains are the main cause of diarrhea in pigs. Pig diarrhea especially post-weaning diarrhea remains one of the most important swine diseases. ETEC bacterial fimbriae including K88, F18, 987P, K99 and F41 promote bacterial attachment to intestinal epithelial cells and facilitate ETEC colonization in pig small intestine. ETEC enterotoxins including heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxins type Ia (porcine-type STa) and type II (STb) stimulate fluid hyper-secretion, leading to watery diarrhea. Blocking bacteria colonization and/or neutralizing enterotoxicity of ETEC toxins are considered effective prevention against ETEC diarrhea. In this study, we applied the MEFA (multiepitope fusion antigen) strategy to create toxoid MEFAs that carried antigenic elements of ETEC toxins, and examined for broad antitoxin immunogenicity in a murine model.

The possibility of using fluorescence spectroscopy to screen for BSE in cattle was explored. Fluorescence spectra from the retinas of experimentally infected BSE-positive cattle with clinical disease were compared with those from both sham-inoculated and non-inoculated BSE-negative cattle. The distinct intensity difference of about 4-10-fold between the spectra of the BSE-positive and the BSE-negative (sham-inoculated and non-inoculated) eyes suggests the basis for a means of developing a rapid, noninvasive examination of BSE in particular and TSEs in general.",

        "Title": "Carbadox has both temporary and lasting effects on the swine gut microbiota.",
        "Abstract": "Antibiotics are used in livestock and poultry production to treat and prevent disease as well as to promote animal growth. Carbadox is an in-feed antibiotic that is widely used in swine production to prevent dysentery and to improve feed efficiency. The goal of this study was to characterize the effects of carbadox and its withdrawal on the swine gut microbiota. Six pigs (initially 3-weeks old) received feed containing carbadox and six received unamended feed. After 3-weeks of continuous carbadox administration, all pigs were switched to a maintenance diet without carbadox. DNA was extracted from feces (n = 142) taken before, during, and following (6-week withdrawal) carbadox treatment. Phylotype analysis using 16S rRNA sequences showed the gradual development of the non-medicated swine gut microbiota over the 8-week study, and that the carbadox-treated pigs had significant differences in bacterial membership relative to non-medicated pigs. Enumeration of fecal Escherichia coli showed that a diet change concurrent with carbadox withdrawal was associated with an increase in the E. coli in the non-medicated pigs, suggesting that carbadox pre-treatment prevented an increase of E. coli populations. In-feed carbadox caused striking effects within 4 days of administration, with significant alterations in both community structure and bacterial membership, notably a large relative increase in Prevotella populations in medicated pigs. Digital PCR was used to show that the absolute abundance of Prevotella was unchanged between the medicated and non-medicated pigs despite the relative increase shown in the phylotype analysis. Carbadox therefore caused a decrease in the abundance of other gut bacteria but did not affect the absolute abundance of Prevotella. The pending regulation on antibiotics used in animal production underscores the importance of understanding how they modulate the microbiota and impact animal health, which will inform the search for antibiotic alternatives.",

        "Abstract": "The spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens requires new treatments. As the rate of development of new antibiotics has severely declined, alternatives to antibiotics must be considered in both animal agriculture and human medicine. Products for disease prevention are different from those for disease treatment, and examples of both are discussed here. For example, modulating the gut microbial community, either through feed additives or fecal transplantation, could be a promising way to prevent certain diseases; for disease treatment, non-antibiotic approaches include phage therapy, phage lysins, bacteriocins, and predatory bacteria. Interestingly, several of these methods augment antibiotic efficacy by improving bacterial killing and decreasing antibiotic resistance selection. Because bacteria can ultimately evolve resistance to almost any therapeutic agent, it is important to continue to use both antibiotics and their alternatives judiciously.",

        "Abstract": "Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) cines of focal liver lesions (FLLs) can be quantitatively analyzed to measure tumor perfusion on a pixel-by-pixel basis for diagnostic indication. However, CEUS cines acquired freehand and during free breathing cause nonuniform in-plane and out-of-plane motion from frame to frame. These motions create fluctuations in the time-intensity curves (TICs), reducing the accuracy of quantitative measurements. Out-of-plane motion cannot be corrected by image registration in 2-dimensional CEUS and degrades the quality of in-plane motion correction (IPMC). A 2-tier IPMC strategy and adaptive out-of-plane motion filter (OPMF) are proposed to provide a stable correction of nonuniform motion to reduce the impact of motion on quantitative analyses.",

        "Abstract": "In recent studies, we demonstrated that a deletion of hha caused increased secretion of locus of enterocyte encoded adherence proteins and reduced motility of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7. In addition to the importance of hha in positive regulation of motility, a two-component quorum sensing pathway encoded by the qseBC genes has been shown to activate bacterial motility in response to mammalian stress hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine as well as bacterially produced autoinducer-3. In this study, we compared regulatory contribution and hierarchy of hha, a member of the Hha/YmoA family of nucleoid-associated proteins, to that of qseBC in the expression of EHEC O157:H7 motility. Since norepinephrine affects motility of EHEC O157:H7 through a qseBC-encoded two-component quorum sensing signaling, we also determined whether the hha-mediated regulation of motility is affected by norepinephrine and whether this effect is qseBC dependent. We used single (\u0394hha or \u0394qseC) and double (\u0394hha \u0394qseC) deletion mutants to show that hha exerts a greater positive regulatory effect in comparison to qseBC on the expression of motility by EHEC O157:H7. We also show that Hha is hierarchically superior in transcriptional regulation of motility than QseBC because transcription of qseC was significantly reduced in the hha deletion mutant compared to that in the parental and the hha-complemented mutant strains. These results suggest that hha regulates motility of EHEC O157:H7 directly as well as indirectly by controlling the transcription of qseBC.",

        "Title": "Escherichia coli O157:H7 lacking the qseBC-encoded quorum-sensing system outcompetes the parental strain in colonization of cattle intestines.",
        "Abstract": "The qseBC-encoded quorum-sensing system regulates the motility of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in response to bacterial autoinducer 3 (AI-3) and the mammalian stress hormones epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE). The qseC gene encodes a sensory kinase that autophosphorylates in response to AI-3, E, or NE and subsequently phosphorylates its cognate response regulator QseB. In the absence of QseC, QseB downregulates bacterial motility and virulence in animal models. In this study, we found that 8- to 10-month-old calves orally inoculated with a mixture of E. coli O157:H7 and its isogenic qseBC mutant showed significantly higher fecal shedding of the qseBC mutant. In vitro analysis revealed similar growth profiles and motilities of the qseBC mutant and the parental strain in the presence or absence of NE. The magnitudes of the response to NE and expression of flagellar genes flhD and fliC were also similar for the qseBC mutant and the parental strain. The expression of ler (a positive regulator of the locus of enterocyte effacement [LEE]), the ler-regulated espA gene, and the csgA gene (encoding curli fimbriae) was increased in the qseBC mutant compared to the parental strain. On the other hand, growth, motility, and transcription of flhD, fliC, ler, espA, and csgA were significantly reduced in the qseBC mutant complemented with a plasmid-cloned copy of the qseBC genes. Thus, in vitro motility and gene expression data indicate that the near-parental level of motility, ability to respond to NE, and enhanced expression of LEE and curli genes might in part be responsible for increased colonization and fecal shedding of the qseBC mutant in calves.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, there have been increasing developments in the field of contrast-enhanced ultrasound both in the creation of new contrast agents and in imaging modalities. These contrast agents have been employed to study tumor vasculature in order to improve cancer detection and diagnosis. An in vivo study is presented of ultrasound imaging of gas filled hollow silica microshells and nanoshells which have been delivered intraperitoneally to an IGROV-1 tumor bearing mouse. In contrast to microbubbles, this formulation of microshells provided strong ultrasound imaging signals by shell disruption and release of gas. Imaging of the microshells in an animal model was facilitated by novel image processing. Although the particle signal could be identified by eye under live imaging, high background obfuscated the particle signal in still images and near the borders of the tumor with live images. Image processing techniques were developed that employed the transient nature of the particle signal to selectively filter out the background signal. By applying image registration, high-pass, median, threshold, and motion filtering, a short video clip of the particle signal was compressed into a single image, thereby resolving the silica shells within the tumor. \u00a9 2012 American Vacuum Society.",

        "Abstract": "Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) enables highly specific time-resolved imaging of vasculature by intravenous injection of \u223c2 \u03bcm gas filled microbubbles. To develop a quantitative automated diagnosis of breast tumors with CEUS, breast tumors were induced in rats by administration of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea. A bolus injection of microbubbles was administered and CEUS videos of each tumor were acquired for at least 3 min. The time-intensity curve of each pixel within a region of interest (ROI) was analyzed to measure kinetic parameters associated with the wash-in, peak enhancement, and wash-out phases of microbubble bolus injections since it was expected that the aberrant vascularity of malignant tumors will result in faster and more diverse perfusion kinetics versus those of benign lesions. Parameters were classified using linear discriminant analysis to differentiate between benign and malignant tumors and improve diagnostic accuracy. Preliminary results with a small dataset (10 tumors, 19 videos) show 100% accuracy with fivefold cross-validation testing using as few as two choice variables for training and validation. Several of the parameters which provided the best differentiation between malignant and benign tumors employed comparative analysis of all the pixels in the ROI including enhancement coverage, fractional enhancement coverage times, and the standard deviation of the envelope curve difference normalized to the mean of the peak frame. Analysis of combinations of five variables demonstrated that pixel-by-pixel analysis produced the most robust information for tumor diagnostics and achieved 5 times greater separation of benign and malignant cases than ROI-based analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Alternatives to antibiotics are urgently needed in animal agriculture. The form these alternatives should take presents a complex problem due to the various uses of antibiotics in animal agriculture, including disease treatment, disease prevention, and growth promotion, and to the relative contribution of these uses to the antibiotic resistance problem. Numerous antibiotic alternatives, such as pre- and probiotics, have been proposed but show variable success. This is because a fundamental understanding of how antibiotics improve feed efficiency is lacking, and because an individual alternative is unlikely to embody all of the performance-enhancing functions of antibiotics. High-throughput technologies need to be applied to better understand the problem, and informed combinations of alternatives, including vaccines, need to be considered.",

        "Title": "Fluorescence spectroscopy of the retina from scrapie-infected mice.",
        "Abstract": "Recently, we have proposed that the fluorescence spectra of sheep retina can be well correlated with the presence or absence of scrapie. Scrapie is the most widespread TSE (transmissible spongiform encephalopathy) affecting sheep and goats worldwide. Mice eyes have been previously reported as a model system to study age-related accumulation of lipofuscin, which has been investigated by monitoring the increasing fluorescence with age covering its entire life span. The current work aims at developing mice retina as a convenient model system to diagnose scrapie and other fatal TSE diseases in animals such as sheep and cows. The objective of the research reported here was to determine whether the spectral features are conserved between two different species namely mice and sheep, and whether an appropriate small animal model system could be identified for diagnosis of scrapie based on the fluorescence intensity in retina. The results were consistent with the previous reports on fluorescence studies of healthy and scrapie-infected retina of sheep. The fluorescence from the retinas of scrapie-infected sheep was significantly more intense and showed more heterogeneity than that from the retinas of uninfected mice. Although the structural characteristics of fluorescence spectra of scrapie-infected sheep and mice eyes are slightly different, more importantly, murine retinas reflect the enhancement of fluorescence intensity upon infecting the mice with scrapie, which is consistent with the observations in sheep eyes.",

In order to improve early cancer detection, gas filled hollow boron-doped silica particles have been developed, which can be used for ultrasound-guided breast conservation therapy. The particles are synthesized using a polystyrene template and subsequently calcinated to create hollow, rigid nanoporous microspheres. The microshells are filled with perfluoropentane vapor. Studies were performed in phantoms to optimize particle concentration, injection dose, and the ultrasound settings such as pulse frequency and mechanical index. In vitro studies have shown that these particles can be continuously imaged by US up to 48 min and their signal lifetime persisted for 5 days. These particles could potentially be given by intravenous injection and, in conjunction with contrast-enhanced ultrasound, be utilized as a screening tool to detect smaller breast cancers before they are detectible by traditional mammography.",

        "Abstract": "Type II heat-labile enterotoxins (LT-II) have been reported in Escherichia coli isolates from humans, animals, food and water samples. The goal here was to determine the specific roles of the antigenically distinguishable LT-IIa and LT-IIb subtypes in pathogenesis and virulence of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) which has not been previously reported. The prevalence of genes encoding for LT-II was determined by colony blot hybridization in a collection of 1648 E. coli isolates from calves and pigs with diarrhea or other diseases and from healthy animals. Only five isolates hybridized with the LT-II probe and none of these isolates contained genes for other enterotoxins or adhesins associated with porcine or bovine ETEC. Ligated intestinal loops in calves, pigs, and rabbits were used to determine the potential of purified LT-IIa and LT-IIb to cause intestinal secretion. LT-IIa and LT-IIb caused significant secretion in the intestinal loops in calves but not in the intestinal loops of rabbits or pigs. In contrast, neonatal pigs inoculated with isogenic adherent E. coli containing the cloned genes for LT-I, LT-IIa or LT-IIb developed severe watery diarrhea with weight loss that was significantly greater than pigs inoculated with the adherent, non-toxigenic parental or vector only control strains. The results demonstrate that the incidence of LT-II appeared to be very low in porcine and bovine E. coli. However, a potential role for these enterotoxins in E. coli-mediated diarrhea in animals was confirmed because purified LT-IIa and LT-IIb caused fluid secretion in bovine intestinal loops and adherent isogenic strains containing cloned genes encoding for LT-IIa or LT-IIb caused severe diarrhea in neonatal pigs.",

        "Abstract": "Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains expressing K88 (F4) or F18 fimbriae and heat-labile (LT) and/or heat-stable (ST) toxins are the major cause of diarrhea in young pigs. Effective vaccines inducing antiadhesin (anti-K88 and anti-F18) and antitoxin (anti-LT and anti-ST) immunity would provide broad protection to young pigs against ETEC. In this study, we genetically fused nucleotides coding for peptides from K88ac major subunit FaeG, F18 minor subunit FedF, and LT toxoid (LT(192)) A2 and B subunits for a tripartite adhesin-adhesin-toxoid fusion (FaeG-FedF-LT(192)A2:B). This fusion was used for immunizations in mice and pigs to assess the induction of antiadhesin and antitoxin antibodies. In addition, protection by the elicited antiadhesin and antitoxin antibodies against a porcine ETEC strain was evaluated in a gnotobiotic piglet challenge model. The data showed that this FaeG-FedF-LT(192)A2:B fusion elicited anti-K88, anti-F18, and anti-LT antibodies in immunized mice and pigs. In addition, the anti-porcine antibodies elicited neutralized cholera toxin and inhibited adherence against both K88 and F18 fimbriae. Moreover, immunized piglets were protected when challenged with ETEC strain 30302 (K88ac/LT/STb) and did not develop clinical disease. In contrast, all control nonvaccinated piglets developed severe diarrhea and dehydration after being challenged with the same ETEC strain. This study clearly demonstrated that this FaeG-FedF-LT(192)A2:B fusion antigen elicited antibodies that neutralized LT toxin and inhibited the adherence of K88 and F18 fimbrial E. coli strains and that this fusion could serve as an antigen for vaccines against porcine ETEC diarrhea. In addition, the adhesin-toxoid fusion approach used in this study may provide important information for developing effective vaccines against human ETEC diarrhea.",

        "Title": "Evaluation of hha and hha sepB mutant strains of Escherichia coli O157:H7 as bacterins for reducing E. coli O157:H7 shedding in cattle.",
        "Abstract": "Escherichia coli O157:H7 colonizes cattle intestines by using the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-encoded proteins. The induction of systemic immune response against LEE-encoded proteins, therefore, will prove effective in reducing E. coli O157:H7 colonization in cattle. The previous studies have demonstrated that a hha (encodes for a hemolysin expression modulating protein) deletion enhances expression of LEE-encoded proteins and a sepB (encodes an ATPase required for the secretion of LEE-encoded proteins) deletion results in intracellular accumulation of LEE proteins. In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of the hha and hha sepB deletion mutants as bacterins for reducing fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in experimentally inoculated weaned calves. The weaned calves were injected intramuscularly with the bacterins containing 10(9) heat-killed cells of the hha(+) wild-type or hha or hha sepB isogenic mutants, and boosted with the same doses 2- and 4-weeks later. The evaluation of the immune response two weeks after the last booster immunization revealed that the calves vaccinated with the hha mutant bacterin had higher antibody titers against LEE proteins compared to the titers for these antibodies in the calves vaccinated with the hha sepB mutant or hha(+) wild-type bacterins. Following oral inoculations with 10(10) CFU of the wild-type E. coli O157:H7, the greater numbers of calves in the group vaccinated with the hha or hha sepB mutant bacterins stopped shedding the inoculum strain within a few days after the inoculations compared to the group of calves vaccinated with the hha(+) wild-type bacterin or PBS sham vaccine. Thus, the use of bacterins prepared from the hha and hha sepB mutants for reducing colonization of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle could represent a potentially important pre-harvest strategy to enhance post-harvest safety of bovine food products, water and produce.",

        "Abstract": "The feasibility of exploiting fluorescence spectra of the eye for diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) was examined. Retinas from scrapie-positive sheep were compared with scrapie-negative sheep using fluorescence spectroscopy, and distinct differences in the fluorescence intensity and spectroscopic signatures were observed. The characteristic fluorescent signatures are thought to be the result of an accumulation of lipofuscin in the retina. It appears that the eye, in particular the retina, is a useful tissue for noninvasive examination of some neurological pathologies such as scrapie. The development of procedures based on examinations of the eye that permit the detection of neurological disorders in animals holds great promise.",

Recently it has been shown that spectral signatures of lipofuscin have enabled the detection of bovine central nervous system (CNS) tissue in meat products with high sensitivity (Sch\u00f6nenbr\u00fccher, H., Adhikary, R., Mukherjee, P., Casey, T.A., Rasmussen, M.A., Maistrovich, F.D., Hamir, A.N., Kehrli, M.J., Richt, J., Petrich, J.W. [2008] J Agric Food Chem56, 6220-6226). We report that brain and spinal cord of mice provide fluorescence spectra similar to those of bovine brain and spinal cord. It is concluded that murine CNS tissue is an appropriate model system for bovine CNS tissue for the development of fluorometric CNS detection assays.",

        "Title": "Effect of chlorate, molybdate, and shikimic acid on Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in aerobic and anaerobic cultures.",
        "Abstract": "Experiments were conducted to determine factors that affect sensitivity of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to sodium chlorate (5mM). In our first experiment, cultures grown without chlorate grew more rapidly than those with chlorate. An extended lag before logarithmic growth was observed in anaerobic but not aerobic cultures containing chlorate. Chlorate inhibition of growth during aerobic culture began later than that observed in anaerobic cultures but persisted once inhibition was apparent. Conversely, anaerobic cultures appeared to adapt to chlorate after approximately 10h of incubation, exhibiting rapid compensatory growth. In anaerobic chlorate-containing cultures, 20% of total viable counts were resistant to chlorate by 6h and had propagated to 100% resistance (>10(9)CFU mL(-1)) by 24h. In the aerobic chlorate-containing cultures, 12.9% of colonies had detectable resistance to chlorate by 6h, but only 1% retained detectable resistance at 24h, likely because these cultures had opportunity to respire on oxygen and were thus not enriched via the selective pressure of chlorate. In another study, treatment with shikimic acid (0.34 mM), molybdate (1mM) or their combination had little effect on aerobic or anaerobic growth of Salmonella in the absence of added chlorate. As observed in our earlier study, chlorate resistance was not detected in any cultures without added chlorate. Chlorate resistant Salmonella were recovered at equivalent numbers regardless of treatment after 8h of aerobic or anaerobic culture with added chlorate; however, by 24h incubation chlorate sensitivity was completely restored to aerobic but not anaerobic cultures treated with shikimic acid or molybdate but not their combination. Results indicate that anaerobic adaptation of S. Typhimurium to sodium chlorate during pure culture is likely due to the selective propagation of low numbers of cells exhibiting spontaneous resistance to chlorate and this resistance is not reversible by molybdenum supplementation.",

        "Abstract": "Micro-organisms may simultaneously encounter multiple stresses in their environment. To investigate the protection that several known Escherichia coli O157 : H7 acid-resistance systems might provide against both oxidative and acid stress, the addition of diamide, a membrane-permeable thiol-specific oxidizing agent, or hydrogen peroxide were used concurrent with acid challenge at pH 2.5 to determine bacterial survival. The addition of either diamide or hydrogen peroxide decreased bacterial survival in a dose-dependent manner for E. coli O157 : H7 during challenge at pH 2.5 following overnight growth in LB MES pH 5.5 (acid-resistance system 1, AR1). In contrast, the presence of either glutamate or arginine during challenge provided significant protection against diamide- and hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress during pH 2.5 acid challenge. Oxidative stress protection during acid challenge required gadC and adiA for the glutamate- (AR2) and arginine- (AR3) dependent acid-resistance systems, respectively. In addition, maximal protection against oxidative stress in the presence of glutamate required a low external pH (pH 2.5), since pH 5.5 did not protect. This study demonstrates that the glutamate- and arginine-dependent acid-resistance systems of E. coli O157 : H7 can simultaneously protect against oxidative stress during extreme acid challenge.",

        "Abstract": "A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) assay was developed for detection and characterization of pathogenic Escherichia coli that cause diarrhea and edema disease in swine. The mPCR assay was designed as a single reaction for detecting 5 different adhesins (K88, K99, 987P, F41, and F18), 3 enterotoxins (LT, STaP, and STb), and the Shiga toxin (Stx2e) associated with porcine pathogenic E. coli. The specificity of the mPCR assay was evaluated by comparison with results from previous analysis of 100 porcine isolates characterized by colony blot hybridization with DNA probes for the 5 adhesins and 4 toxin genes. There was complete agreement between the 2 methods. The mPCR assay for E. coli pathogens isolated from swine was further evaluated by examination of strains containing virulence factors that are known to have different antigenic subtypes or DNA sequence variations. It was found that the mPCR assays targeting genes encoding for K88 and F18 amplified products with the appropriate sizes from strains containing genes for different K88 and F18 antigenic subtypes; mPCR assays targeting the gene encoding for STaP amplified product from only STaP-positive but not STaH-positive isolates; and mPCR assays targeting the gene encoding for the Stx2 amplified products from only Stx2-positive and not Stx1-positive isolates. Similarly, mPCR assays targeting the gene encoding for LTI did not produce the appropriate product from strains containing genes for LTII. The mPCR assays are simple to perform, and they should be useful for diagnosis of porcine colibacillosis, including the genotypic characterization of E. coli isolates from pigs with diarrhea or edema disease.",

        "Abstract": "The removal of central nervous system (CNS) tissues as part of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) risk material is one of the highest priority tasks to avoid contamination of the human food chain with BSE. No currently available method enables the real-time detection of possible CNS tissue contamination on carcasses during slaughter. The fluorescent pigment lipofuscin is a heterogeneous, high-molecular weight material that has been shown to be enriched in high concentrations in neuronal tissues. In this study, lipofuscin fluorescence was investigated as a marker for real-time detection of CNS contamination. Front-faced fluorescence spectra of brain and spinal cord samples from 11 cattle gave identical, reproducible fluorescence signal patterns with high intensities. The specificity of these spectra was assessed by investigating 13 different non-CNS tissues enabling the differentiation of brain and spinal cord by signal intensity and structure of the spectra, respectively. Small quantities of bovine spinal cord were reliably detected in the presence of raw bovine skeletal muscle, fat, and vertebrae. The presented data are a fundamental basis for the development of a prototype device allowing real-time monitoring of CNS tissue contamination on bovine carcasses and meat cuts.",

        "Abstract": "Although cattle develop humoral immune responses to Shiga-toxigenic (Stx+) Escherichia coli O157:H7, infections often result in long-term shedding of these human pathogenic bacteria. The objective of this study was to compare humoral and cellular immune responses to Stx+ and Stx- E. coli O157:H7. Three groups of calves were inoculated intrarumenally, twice in a 3-week interval, with different strains of E. coli: a Stx2-producing E. coli O157:H7 strain (Stx2+ O157), a Shiga toxin-negative E. coli O157:H7 strain (Stx- O157), or a nonpathogenic E. coli strain (control). Fecal shedding of Stx2+ O157 was significantly higher than that of Stx- O157 or the control. Three weeks after the second inoculation, all calves were challenged with Stx2+ O157. Following the challenge, levels of fecal shedding of Stx2+ O157 were similar in all three groups. Both groups inoculated with an O157 strain developed antibodies to O157 LPS. Calves initially inoculated with Stx- O157, but not those inoculated with Stx2+ O157, developed statistically significant lymphoproliferative responses to heat-killed Stx2+ O157. These results provide evidence that infections with STEC can suppress the development of specific cellular immune responses in cattle, a finding that will need to be addressed in designing vaccines against E. coli O157:H7 infections in cattle.",

        "Abstract": "Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 virulence factors, specifically those conferring intimate adherence to and formation of attaching and effacing lesions (A/E) on host cells, are encoded by a horizontally acquired locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). Expression of several LEE-encoded genes, which are organized into operons LEE1 through LEE5, is under the positive regulation of ler, the first gene in the LEE1 operon. We have recently demonstrated that EHEC O157:H7 lacking hha exhibited greater than a 10-fold increase in ler expression and that the repression of ler results from the binding of Hha to the ler promoter. In this report, we show that an hha mutant of EHEC O157:H7 exhibited increased adherence to Hep-2 cells, had increased transcriptional activities of LEE1, LEE2, LEE3, and LEE5 as determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays, and expressed LEE5::lac transcriptional fusion at levels that were several-fold higher than that expressed by the parental hha+ strain. These results demonstrate that hha is an important regulatory component of the cascade that governs the expression of LEE operons and the resulting ability of EHEC O157:H7 to intimately adhere to host cells.",

        "Abstract": "Lipofuscin is a yellow-brown, highly fluorescent pigment that undergoes an age-related progressive accumulation in animal cells, mainly in postmitotic cells. It is a heterogeneous, high-molecular weight material associated with proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. Lipofuscin is implicated in many aspects of human health, including aging, oxidative stress, macular degeneration, lipid peroxidation, atherosclerosis, dementia (Alzheimer's Disease) and diseases associated with prions. Although the fluorescent properties of lipofuscin have long been recognized, neither histologists nor chemists have yet isolated the pigments themselves or characterized their optical properties. We have prepared lipofuscinlike species by reacting malondialdehyde (MDA) with cysteine (Cys). MDA:Cys adducts 3:2 and 2:2 are two of those that have been identified among the many that were present in the reaction. Whereas previous attempts to synthesize lipofuscinlike species resulted in compounds that were either nonfluorescent or emitted principally in the blue, the MDA:Cys adducts reported in this study are not only fluorescent but also emit over a broader range.",

        "Abstract": "Digestion of green plants in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract produces degradation products from chlorophyll that cause ingesta and feces to be highly fluorescent. This property was exploited for development and construction of instruments to noninvasively detect minute quantities of feces on meat samples in real time. The presence of feces on meat products is a primary source of foodborne pathogens, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella. This new technology provides a rapid and accurate alternative to the practice of visual inspection and augments more time-consuming biological testing methods. This innovation can assist meat processors and government inspectors in their efforts to provide safe and wholesome food to consumers.",

        "Abstract": "This study describes the development of a high-throughput genetic system for producing oligopeptides that can be used to identify molecular interactions leading to inhibition of specific proteins. Using a pathogenic bacteria model, we screened a library of clones expressing intracellular oligopeptides in order to identify inhibitors of proteins involved in antibiotic resistance and virulence. This method involved transforming the pathogen with an oligopeptide-encoding plasmid library, constructed using polymerase chain reaction and an oligonucleotide template designed to produce random oligopeptides composed of 2-16 amino acids, and high-throughput screening for phenotype alterations in the pathogen. A subsequent complementation phase enabled the identification of the full-length bacterial protein inhibited by the oligopeptide. Using this method we were able to identify oligopeptides that inhibit virulence and/or drug resistance in Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli; specific virulence and/or drug resistance proteins of Salmonella, Shigella, and E. coli that are sensitive to inhibition; and putative oligopeptide-binding sites on the inhibited proteins. This system is versatile and can be extended to other pathogens for analogous studies and it can be modified for used in eukaryotic models for identifying protein interactions that can be targeted for inhibition. Additionally, this system can be used for identifying protein domains involved in any biomolecular interaction.",

        "Abstract": "The presence of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle illustrates the complex, interrelated nature of the environment, livestock production practices, food safety, and the science of microbiology, particularly microbial ecology. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli, including E. coli O157:H7, can cause severe human diseases that can be debilitating and life threatening. Cattle are currently considered to be the definitive source for E. coli O157:H7 in the food supply, but this view may be simplistic and incomplete. E. coli O157:H7, appears widespread among U.S. cattle herds, while individual animal prevalence is low and transient. Most individual animals appear to be a transient reservoir for E. coli O157:H7 although the issue of carrier animals still remains unresolved. Epidemiological studies of the cattle production system have not clearly identified risk factors or management practices that affect E. coli O157:H7 prevalence in cattle feces. The problem of E. coli O157:H7 increases during the summer and fall months, but the environmental factors that contribute to this increase are poorly understood. Possible environmental factors that may influence E. coli O157:H7 shedding in cattle include livestock feed and waste handling practices as well as insects and microbial interactions in soil and water. Studies of E. coli O157:H7 ecology in cattle and the environment have been limited, but they suggest that a consideration of other independent, environmental sources of this microbe seems appropriate. The natural ecology of cholera may serve as a useful environmental model for pursuing additional environmental research on the occurrence and transmission of E. coli O157:H7 in nature.",

        "Abstract": "Methanogenic bacteria, which are common inhabitants of the animal digestive tract, contain the fluorescent compound F420 (coenzyme 420), a 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin chromophore. F420 was characterized as an initial step in determining if this compound would be useful as a fluorescent marker for the detection of fecal and ingesta contamination. Using a single anion exchange chromatographic process, F420 was separated from other cell components of a Methanobrevibacter sp. cell culture. The extent of separation was determined spectroscopically. To aid in the development of possible techniques for the detection of fecal contamination using F420 as a marker, further spectroscopic investigation of F420 was conducted using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence methods. The fluorescence lifetime of F420 in an elution buffer of pH 7.5 was found to be 4.2 ns. At higher pH values, the fluorescence decay, F(t), was best described by a sum of two exponentials: at pH 13, F(t) = 0.31 exp(-t/4.20 ns) + 0.69 exp(-t/1.79 ns). Further investigation using front-faced fluorescence techniques has shown that emission from F420 can be collected efficiently from samples of methanogen cell cultures as well as from fecal material.",

        "Abstract": "Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is an important cause of food-borne illness in humans. Ruminants appear to be more frequently colonized by STEC than are other animals, but the reason(s) for this is unknown. We compared the frequency, magnitude, duration, and transmissibility of colonization of sheep by E. coli O157:H7 to that by other pathotypes of E. coli. Young adult sheep were simultaneously inoculated with a cocktail consisting of two strains of E. coli O157:H7, two strains of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and one strain of enteropathogenic E. coli. Both STEC strains and ETEC 2041 were given at either 10(7) or 10(10) CFU/strain/animal. The other strains were given only at 10(10) CFU/strain. We found no consistent differences among pathotypes in the frequency, magnitude, and transmissibility of colonization. However, the STEC strains tended to persist to 2 weeks and 2 months postinoculation more frequently than did the other pathotypes. The tendency for persistence of the STEC strains was apparent following an inoculation dose of either 10(7) or 10(10) CFU. One of the ETEC strains also persisted when inoculated at 10(10) CFU. However, in contrast to the STEC strains, it did not persist when inoculated at 10(7) CFU. These results support the hypothesis that STEC is better adapted to persist in the alimentary tracts of sheep than are other pathotypes of E. coli.",

        "Abstract": "Semi-automated detection of Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 and non-O157:H7 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) was achieved using fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These PCR assays were designed to amplify 80, 120 and 150 bp regions of virulence genes stx1, stx2 and eaeA, respectively, using specific primers. The fluorogenic probes were used for specific detection of amplified products of the stx1 and stx2 genes of STEC, and the eaeA gene of EHEC O157:H7. For multiplex PCR assay, the three sets of primers and fluorogenic probes were included in one reaction to simultaneously amplify and detect any of the three targeted virulence genes. In non-multiplex PCR assay, each of the three virulence genes was amplified and detected in independent reactions. The specificity of these assays was evaluated using suspensions of STEC and other bacterial species lacking stx1, stx2 and eaeA. The multiplex assay detected all STEC harbouring any combination of three virulence genes. Three non-multiplex PCR reactions identified types of Shiga toxin genes carried by a STEC and identified STEC as either EHEC O157:H7 or non-O157:H7 STEC. Sensitivity limits of these assays in beef and faeces inoculated with EHEC O157:H7 were 5.8 to 580 cfu and 1.2 to 1200 cfu, respectively. These assays can be completed within 8-10 h when performed simultaneously or within 13 h if the multiplex assay is used as an initial screen for detecting STEC and the non-multiplex assay is used for subsequent detection of stx1 and stx2 of STEC and eaeA of EHEC O157:H7",

        "Abstract": "Toxin-producing Escherichia coli expressing F18 fimbriae colonizes the small intestines of weaned pigs and causes diarrhea, edema disease, or both. The F18 family is composed of two antigenic variants, F18ab and F18ac. Because many strains do not express F18 fimbriae in vitro, identification and differentiation of these two variants are difficult. Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis is a rapid method for identifying genetic mutations and polymorphisms. The F18 major fimbrial subunit genes (fedA) of 138 strains were amplified by PCR, and genetic differences were detected by SSCP analysis. The SSCP analysis of the fedA gene differentiated F18ab+ strains from F18ac+ strains. Most strains classified as F18ab+ by SSCP analysis contained Shiga toxin 2e and enterotoxin genes. Most strains classified as F18ac+ by SSCP analysis contained only enterotoxin genes. The SSCP analysis was a useful method for predicting the antigenicity of F18+ E. coli and could also be used for analysis of other virulence genes in E. coli and other pathogenic bacteria.",

        "Abstract": "The role of Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin B (STb) in neonatal porcine diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli was examined by comparing adherent isogenic strains with or without STb. The cloned STb gene (in the plasmid pRAS1) was electroporated into a nonenterotoxigenic strain (226M) which expresses the F41 adhesin. Strain 226M pRAS1 adhered and expressed STb in vivo, causing fluid secretion in ligated ileal loops in neonatal pigs. Although strain 226M pRAS1 caused very mild diarrhea in some orally inoculated neonatal pigs, the weight loss in these pigs was similar to that caused by the parental strain without STb. We conclude that STb does not significantly contribute to diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli in neonatal pigs.",

        "Abstract": "Comparative fimbrial expression and adhesion studies were made on enterotoxigenic and verotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC and VTEC) strains isolated from cases of porcine postweaning diarrhoea or oedema disease. F107(F18ab) fimbriae--monitored by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies and by electron microscopy--were poorly expressed on most VTEC strains. In contrast, 2134P(F18ac) fimbriae were more readily detected on most ETEC strains. The F18ac strains adhered in vivo to ligated intestinal loops in weaned pigs while the F18ab strains did not adhere or adhered weakly. Similarly, the F18ac strains adhered to isolated intestinal brush borders in weaned pigs but the F18ab strains (except for the F107 reference E. coli) did not adhere or adhered weakly in vitro. Neither the F18ab nor F18ac strains adhered to brush borders from newborn pigs. In vitro adhesion of F18ab and F18ac strains was mannose resistant and receptors for F18 seemed to differ from receptors for K88(F4). It is concluded that the antigenic variants of F18 fimbriae (F18ab and F18ac) are biologically distinct. F18ab fimbriae are expressed poorly both in vitro and in vivo and are frequently linked with the production of SLT-IIv and serogroup O139, while F18ac are more efficiently expressed in vitro and in vivo and most often are linked with enterotoxin (STa, STb) production, and serogroups O141, O157.",

        "Abstract": "We have previously identified two K88ac adhesion receptors (210 and 240 kDa) which are present in membrane preparations from adhesive but not nonadhesive porcine intestinal brush border cells; these adhesin receptors are postulated to be important determinants of the susceptibility of pigs to K88ac+ enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infections (A.K. Erickson, J.A. Willgohs, S.Y. McFarland, D.A. Benfield, and D.F. Francis, Infect. Immun. 60:983-988, 1992). We now describe a procedure for the purification of these two receptors. Receptors were solubilized from adhesive intestinal brush border vesicles using deoxycholate and were purified by gel filtration chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B and then by hydroxyapatite chromatography. Amino acid compositional analyses indicated that the two receptors have similar amino acid compositions. The most distinguishing characteristic of both receptors is a high percentage of threonine and proline residues. Neuraminidase treatment caused the K88ac adhesin receptors to migrate with a slower mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, indicating that these receptors are sialoglycoproteins. Results from lectin-binding studies indicated that the receptors contain O-linked oligosaccharides composed of galactosyl (beta-1,3)N-acetylgalactosamine, alpha-linked fucose, galactosyl(beta-1,4)N-acetylglucosamine, sialic acid, galactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine. Collectively, these characteristics indicate that the K88ac adhesin receptors are mucin-type sialoglycoproteins.",

        "Abstract": "Mycobacteria are unusual causes of keratitis and other ocular infections but the outcome of infection is often serious. We report a case of keratitis due to Mycobacterium chelonae, a rapidly growing environmental mycobacterium, in a soft contact-lens wearer, and discuss the difficulty and delay in identifying the organism, twice erroneously identified as Nocardia asteroides on morphological grounds. Despite in vitro susceptibility, the response to anti-bacterial agents was negligible and a second keratoplasty was required after a recurrence of disease at the donor-host junction. We review the role of mycobacteria as the cause of keratitis and other forms of ocular disease.",

        "Abstract": "Pasteurella haemolytica is the leading cause of economic loss to the beef cattle industry in the United States and an important etiologic agent worldwide. Study of P. haemolytica is hindered by researchers' inability to genetically manipulate the organism. A new restriction endonuclease, PhaI, an isoschizomer of SfaNI (R. J. Roberts, Methods Enzymol. 65:19-36, 1980), was isolated from P. haemolytica serotype 1, strain NADC-D60, obtained from pneumonic bovine lung. PhaI recognizes the 5-base nonpalindromic sequences 5'-GCATC-3' and 5'-GATGC-3'. Cleavage occurs 5 bases 3' from the former recognition site and 9 bases 5' from the latter recognition site. A gene encoding a methyltransferase which protects against PhaI cleavage was cloned from P. haemolytica NADC-D60 into Escherichia coli. Whereas unmethylated plasmid DNA containing a P. haemolytica origin of replication was unable to transform P. haemolytica when introduced by electroporation, the same plasmid DNA obtained from E. coli which contained a cloned PhaI methyltransferase gene could do so. The data indicate that PhaI is an effective barrier to the introduction and establishment of exogenous DNA in P. haemolytica.",

        "Abstract": "We investigated the role of the rumen fermentation as a barrier to the foodborne pathogen, Escherichia coli O157:H7. Strains of E. coli, including several isolates of O157:H7, grew poorly in media which simulated the ruminal environment of a well-fed animal. Strains of E. coli O157:H7 did not display a superior tolerance to ruminal conditions which may facilitate their colonization of the bovine digestive tract. Unrestricted growth of E. coli was observed in rumen fluid collected from fasted cattle. Growth was inhibited by rumen fluid collected from well-fed animals. Well-fed animals appear less likely to become reservoirs for pathogenic E. coli. These results have implications for cattle slaughter practices and epidemiological studies of E. coli O157:H7.",

        "Abstract": "Fimbriae (pili) of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), including K88, K99, 987P, and F41, are adhesins that facilitate intestinal colonization in neonatal pigs. K88 is also associated with some ETEC isolated from weaned pigs. Many ETEC isolates from weaned pigs do not express known adhesins and are termed 4P-. A novel bacterial adhesin, 2134P, was recently identified on two 4P- ETEC isolates from weaned pigs. In this study, we identified a 2134P-specific monoclonal antibody, mAb 6C7/C1, that blocked the binding of 2134P+ bacteria to intestinal epithelial cells. Indirect immunofluorescent antibody and immunoperoxidase assays using mAb 6C7/C1 confirmed that the 2134P adhesin is expressed in vivo by adherent bacteria in pigs challenge-exposed with 2134P+ ETEC. 2134P was detected on 31% of 189 postweaning diarrhea 4P- ETEC isolates from the National Animal Disease Center's culture collection by dot blot immunoperoxidase assays using mAb 6C7/C1. We conclude that 2134P is a bacterial adhesin and is an important virulence attribute of some ETEC that cause diarrhea in weaned pigs.",

        "Abstract": "A DNA probe derived from the subunit gene of a cloned 987P determinant was used to characterize the locations of the 987P genes in several Escherichia coli strains. We examined E. coli 987, a nonpiliated mutant of strain 987 (I36) that does not express 987P in vitro, and a variant of I36 that expressed 987P following growth in vivo. We found that plasmid and chromosomal copies of the 987P subunit gene could be differentiated in strain 987 by restriction endonuclease analysis and Southern blot hybridization. The nonpiliated mutant I36 had lost the plasmid copy but retained the chromosomal copy of the 987P gene. A 987P-piliated variant of I36, which did not contain the 987P plasmid, colonized and caused diarrhea in neonatal pigs similarly to wild-type 987. The plasmid that hybridized with the 987P probe was transferred from strain 987 to an E. coli K-12 strain by conjugation. We were unable to demonstrate expression of 987P by these transconjugants. The data suggest that the chromosomal and plasmid copies of the 987P genes may interact to influence 987P expression.",

        "Abstract": "We report a retrospective analysis of the clinical indications for 3555 penetrating keratoplasties performed at our department between 1971 and 1990. The cases were distributed among 12 diagnostic categories. Regrafting was the most common indication overall, accounting for 1452 cases (40.8%). Other major indications were, in order of decreasing frequency, keratoconus (17%), scarring secondary to herpes simplex keratitis (11.7%), aphakic bullous keratopathy (5.9%) and interstitial keratitis (5%). Further analysis of the relative percentages in each category within each 5-year interval of the study period was carried out to identify any changes in incidence. Viral disease as an indication for penetrating keratoplasty has shown a gradual decrease in frequency, accounting for only 6.4% of the cases during the last 5-year period (1986-90) compared with 19.6% during the first 5 years (1971-75). This finding is consistent with the marked improvement in the recognition and medical treatment of herpes simplex keratitis. The increase in incidence of grafting for pseudophakic bullous keratopathy in 1986-90 (6.7%) compared with 1981-85 (1.1%) correlates well with the dramatic increase in the number of cataract extractions with intraocular lens implantations performed during that period.",

        "Abstract": "Three-week-old weaned and colostrum-deprived neonatal (less than 1 day old) pigs were inoculated to determine the pathogenicity of 2 enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli isolates that do not express K88, K99, F41, or 987P adhesins (strains 2134 and 2171). Strains 2134 and 2171 were isolated from pigs that had diarrhea after weaning attributable to enterotoxigenic E coli infection. We found that both strains of E coli adhered in the ileum and caused diarrhea in pigs of both age groups. In control experiments, adherent bacteria were not seen in the ileum of pigs less than 1 day old or 3 weeks old that were noninoculated or inoculated with a nonpathogenic strain of E coli. These control pigs did not develop diarrhea. Antisera raised against strains 2134 and 2171 and absorbed with the autologous strain, grown at 18 C, were used for bacterial-agglutination and colony-immunoblot assays. Both absorbed antisera reacted with strains 2134 and 2171, but not with strains that express K99, F41, or 987P adhesins. A cross-reaction was observed with 2 wild-type K88 strains, but not with a K12 strain that expresses K88 pili. Indirect immunofluorescence with these absorbed antisera revealed adherent bacteria in frozen sections of ileum from pigs infected with either strain. We concluded that these strains are pathogenic and express a common surface antigen that may be a novel adhesin in E coli strains that cause diarrhea in weaned pigs.",

It was also found to be higher than the previously reported prevalence of 38% in a group of keratoconus patients with similar age and sex match to our series.

Sau3A restriction enzyme digests resulted in similar rRNA gene restriction patterns in S. hyodysenteriae strains from five different countries. Some S. hyodysenteriae strains could be differentiated by variations in their rRNA gene restriction patterns after cleavage of DNA by restriction enzymes SspI or BglII. S. innocens and Treponema succinifaciens, non-pathogenic pig intestinal spirochetes, had rRNA gene restriction patterns that differed markedly from the S. hyodysenteriae patterns, and from each other.",

        "Abstract": "Intestinal colonization of 3-week-old weaned pigs by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains that were originally isolated from weaned pigs with fatal diarrhea and that lacked K88, K99, F41, and 987P adhesins (4P- ETEC) was studied by histologic, immunofluorescent, and electron microscopic techniques. In the first experiment, 16 principal pigs were inoculated orogastrically with ETEC strain 2134 (serogroup O157: H19) or 2171 (serogroup 0141:H4), and eight control pigs were not inoculated. In the second experiment, 24 principals were inoculated with ETEC strain 2134, and 12 controls were inoculated with a nonenterotoxigenic strain of E. coli. Principal and control pigs were necropsied at intervals from 24 to 72 hours after inoculation of principals to provide the tissues used for this report. Results from the two experiments and with both ETEC strains were similar and therefore were combined. Adhesion by 4P- ETEC was demonstrated in ileum but not in cecum or colon in 22/40 principal pigs sampled at 24 to 72 hours after orogastric inoculation. Adherent bacteria were most apparent on the intestinal villi covering Peyer's patches. Only occasional adherent bacteria were detected in ileal sections from a few (4/20) of the control pigs. Adherence by 4P- ETEC was characterized by \"patches\" of bacteria closely associated with the lateral surfaces and less frequently with the tips and the bases of intact villi. In most cases, the adherent bacteria were separated from epithelial cell microvilli and other bacterial cells by a 50-400-nm space. Filamentous bacterial appendages bridged this space and formed a network among adjacent bacteria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Title": "Susceptibility of porcine intestine to pilus-mediated adhesion by some isolates of piliated enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli increases with age.",
        "Abstract": "Two porcine isolates of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) (serogroup O157 and O141) derived from fatal cases of postweaning diarrhea and lacking K88, K99, F41, and 987P pili (4P- ETEC) were tested for adhesiveness to small-intestinal epithelia of pigs of different ages. Neither strain adhered to isolated intestinal brush borders of newborn (1-day-old) pigs in the presence of mannose. However, mannose-resistant adhesion occurred when brush borders from 10-day- and 3- and 6-week-old pigs were used. Electron microscopy revealed that both strains produced fine (3.5-nm) and type 1 pili at 37 degrees C but only type 1 pili at 18 degrees C. Mannose-resistant in vitro adhesion to brush borders of older pigs correlated with the presence of fine pili. These strains produced predominantly fine pili in ligated intestinal loops of both older and newborn pigs, but adherence was greater in loops in older pigs. Immunoelectron microscopic studies, using antiserum raised against piliated bacteria and absorbed with nonpiliated bacteria, of samples from brush border adherence studies revealed labelled appendages between adherent bacteria and intestinal microvilli. Orogastric inoculation of pigs weaned at 10 and 21 days of age indicated significantly (P less than 0.001) higher levels of adhesion by the ETEC to the ileal epithelia of older pigs than to that of younger ones. We suggest that small-intestinal adhesion and colonization by these ETEC isolates is dependent on receptors that develop progressively with age during the first 3 weeks after birth. Furthermore, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the fine pili described mediate intestinal adhesion by the 4P- ETEC strains studied.",

        "Abstract": "A 76-year-old man with bilateral practolol-induced dry eyes developed atypical acute bilateral corneal calcification. Serum calcium, phosphate, and urea levels were within normal limits. The calcium deposition progressed rapidly to involve 90% of the right cornea. Right penetrating keratoplasty was performed with subsequent visual rehabilitation of the patient. Left tectonic penetrating keratoplasty was performed 8 weeks later after corneal perforation. The corneal specimens were examined by light and electron microscopy, which showed an atypical calcareous degeneration involving Bowman's layer as well as the full thickness of the stroma. Transmission electron microscopy showed the granular calcification to consist of extracellular, radially orientated aggregates of fine, needle-shaped crystals. Both transplants remained clear with no evidence of postoperative recurrence. To our knowledge this is the first report of bilateral penetrating keratoplasty for acute calcareous degeneration.",

The mean follow-up was 6.1 years with a range of 4-16 years. The systemic associations and the postoperative complications were analysed. Grafting in cases associated with Down's syndrome had a higher incidence of complications. 93% of grafts remained clear and 81% achieved a final corrected visual acuity of 6/12 or better. 21% of eyes developed a homograft reaction, with 50% of rejection episodes occurring in the first year after operation. Factors associated with higher incidence of rejection included loose sutures, traumatic wound dehiscence, and grafts larger than 8.5 mm. Only three grafts with rejection episodes lost graft clarity, while rejection in the rest was successfully reversed with topical steroid therapy. No relationship was found between donor age and long-term graft clarity.",

DNA-DNA relative reassociation experiments in which the S1 nuclease method was used showed that T. hyodysenteriae B78T and B204 had 93% sequence homology with each other and approximately 40% sequence homology with T. innocens B256T and 4/71. Both T. hyodysenteriae B78T and T. innocens B256T exhibited negligible levels of DNA homology (less than or equal to 5%) with T. succinifaciens 6091T. The results of comparisons of protein electrophoretic profiles corroborated the DNA-DNA reassociation results. We found high levels of similarity (greater than or equal to 96%) in electrophoretic profiles among T. hyodysenteriae strains, moderate levels of similarity (43 to 49%) between T. hyodysenteriae and T. innocens, and no detectable similarity between the profiles of either T. hyodysenteriae or T. innocens and those of T. succinifaciens, T. bryantii, and Escherichia coli. Restriction endonuclease analysis of DNA was not useful in assessing genetic relationships since there was heterogeneity even between strains of T. hyodysenteriae. Partial 16S rRNA sequences of the intestinal spirochetes were determined by using a modified Sanger method and were compared in order to evaluate the phylogenetic relationships among these and other spirochetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Abstract": "Certain DNA probes derived from accessory genes of cloned K88 and F41 determinants hybridize with Escherichia coli strains that express K88 or F41 and with certain other E. coli strains that do not express these antigens. We found that these probes hybridized with human enteroinvasive E. coli, and with bovine E. coli isolates which produced a fatal septicemia in experimentally infected piglets. These strains did not hybridize with probes derived from the structural subunit genes encoding the K88 and F41 antigens. E. coli strains isolated from turkeys with septicemia, Shigella and Salmonella strains did not hybridize to the K88 and F41 accessory gene probes. The K88 and F41 accessory genes probes hybridized with a 200 kb plasmid which is required for invasion by human enteroinvasive E. coli. The K88 and F41 accessory gene homology in the bovine isolates was located on a 150 kb transmissible plasmid but was unrelated to plasmids encoding aerobactin, Vir, or colicin V, which are suspected virulence factors in septicemic E. coli. A common plasmid-encoded antigen was associated with bovine isolates that hybridized with the K88 and F41 accessory gene probes. This included strains which express CS31A, a surface antigen associated with bovine septicemic E. coli, which also hybridized with the K88 and F4 accessory gene probes. The results suggest that the K88 and F41 accessory gene probes hybridized with sequences that may be associated with a common mechanism of pilus expression in distinct groups of E. coli pathogens.",

        "Abstract": "A total of 205 Escherichia coli isolates from 88 diarrheal weanling (4- to 10-week-old) pigs from 59 farms were tested by slide agglutination for K88, K99, F41, and 987P antigens. K88 antigen was detected in 61% of the isolates representing 60% of the pigs and 56% of the farms. K88 antigen was associated with serogroup O149 and 91% of the K88+ isolates. K99, F41, and 987P were not detected. Of the K88- isolates, 70 were additionally tested by colony hybridization with DNA probes for adherence factors K88, K99, 987P, and F41 and for enterotoxin genes STaP, STaH, STb, and LT and by Vero cell assay for verotoxins (VT). The 70 K88- isolates could be divided into three categories: LT-, VT-, STaP+, and/or STb+ (34 isolates); LT-, STaP+, STb+, and/or VT+ (17 isolates); and nontoxigenic (19 isolates). Only one of the K88- isolates carried a known adherence factor (987P) detectable with DNA probes. Most of the STaP+ and STb+ isolates belonged to O groups O141, O147, and O157. All but 1 of the 17 VT+ isolates belonged to O groups O138, O139, O141, and O149. Only three of the VT+ strains were isolated from pigs with edema disease. We concluded that 73% of the K88- isolates had the capability to produce enterotoxins or VT that could have contributed to weanling pig diarrhea.",

        "Abstract": "A reproducible model of postweaning colibacillosis was obtained by controlling management and environmental variables to simulate conditions often seen at weaning. Suckling pigs were exposed briefly to starter diet at 1 week of age, weaned at 3 weeks of age, held at an ambient temperature of 20 +/- 2 C, and again given the starter diet. One day after weaning, each pig was given 10(10) colony-forming units of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strain M1823B (O157:K88ac:H43-LT+ STb+) in broth containing 1.2% sodium bicarbonate via stomach tube. In vitro adhesion by strain M1823B to isolated intestinal branch borders was used to test pigs for susceptibility to K88. In this model, 3 syndromes were induced in susceptible pigs: (1) peracute fatal diarrhea; (2) moderate diarrhea, weight loss, and fecal shedding of the inoculum strain; and (3) no diarrhea, weight loss, and fecal shedding of the inoculum strain. Rotavirus particles were not found in fecal specimens of pigs with diarrhea. The K88-susceptible, noninoculated control pigs remained clinically normal. It was concluded that susceptibility to adhesion by K88+ enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli was a requirement for the production of disease in this model; inoculation with rotavirus was not necessary.",

        "Abstract": "This retrospective study of 549 corneo-scleral rim cultures shows that gentamicin, used in MK and K-Sol medium storage at 4 degrees C, has decreased donor contamination from 43% in whole-globe storage to 13%, but failed to eliminate coagulase negative staphylococci (37%), streptococci (28%) and fungi (28%). Donor-to-host transmitted staphylococcal and streptococcal endophthalmitis have been reported previously. We present the first documented case of donor-to-recipient transmitted fungal endophthalmitis following corneal transplantation using corneas stored in MK or K-Sol solution at 4 degrees C; Candida albicans was isolated. Recommendations are made to assess critically the true incidence of donor fungal contamination and the necessity of adding anti-mycotic agents to preservation medium for 4 degrees C storage. In the absence of ideal antimicrobial cover for corneal preservation solutions, stringent prophylactic measures to reduce contamination and continued monitoring of corneo-scleral rim cultures are warranted, if the poor visual consequences of donor-to-host transmitted endophthalmitis are to be avoided.",

        "Abstract": "Four hundred twenty-nine isolates of Escherichia coli from calves were tested for the production of HeLa cell cytotoxin(s). Isolates that produced enough cytotoxin to be detected in culture supernatants of iron-depleted broth were considered to produce increased amounts of cytotoxins. Isolates also were tested for homology with a DNA probe for a gene that encodes localized adherence of human enteropathogenic E coli. Four isolates produced increased amounts of cytotoxin that was neutralized by Shiga antitoxin (toxin designated as Shiga-like toxin-I [SLT-I]). A 5th isolate produced increased amounts of cytotoxin (SLT+) that was not neutralized by the Shiga antitoxin, but was neutralized by antitoxin against a variant of SLT (toxin designated as SLT-II). None of the isolates hybridized with the probe for the localized adherence gene. Three of the SLT+ isolates belonged to human enteropathogenic E coli serogroups O26 and O111. All 5 of the SLT+ isolates were from calves with diarrhea, but none of the 5 SLT+ isolates contained genes for classic heat-labile or heat-stable enterotoxins, for K99 fimbriae, or for invasiveness; neither did any of them adhere to HeLa cells in culture. Three of the 5 SLT+ isolates had attaching and effacing activities when inoculated into ligated intestinal loops of rabbits. One of the isolates with attaching and effacing activity in rabbits was originally isolated from a calf with lesions characteristic of those produced by attaching effacing E coli (AEEC). Calves inoculated with this SLT+ AEEC isolate developed focal colonic lesions characteristic of those produced by AEEC, but did not develop diarrhea.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The EGF in defined serum-free (S-F) media was able to stimulate endothelial cell mitosis (t test P less than 0.01) in matched transected human corneas after a four-day incubation period as judged by histologic studies. Clearly defined endothelial mitotic figures were seen in all stages of cell division throughout the endothelial cell layer.

        "Title": "Reducing the risk of corneal graft rejection. A comparison of different methods.",
        "Abstract": "Corneal graft rejection represents the leading cause of failure in corneal transplantation. Two of the major risk factors for graft rejection are previous sensitization, usually in the form of a previous rejected corneal graft and corneal vascularization. The major histocompatibility MHC antigens (HLA, A, B and DR) are the target of the corneal graft rejection process. Because HLA, A, B, and DR antigens have been found in the corneal epithelium, the corneal stroma, and the corneal endothelium, matching patients and donors would seem to reduce the incidence of rejection. The results of studies on HLA, A, B, and DR matching are discussed. Cyclosporin, a fungal by-product, prevents the proliferation of sensitized cytotoxic T cells. Its use topically in corneal transplant patients in a controlled series has also reduced the incidence of rejection. Its use systemically has also been tried in an effort to prevent corneal graft rejection.",

        "Abstract": "Colony hybridizations with 4 enterotoxins (STaP, STaH, STb, and LT) and 1 adherence factor (K99) gene probes were done on Escherichia coli isolated from calves. Agreement between the K99 probing and a serologic assay to detect the K99 antigen was 99% for the identification of K99+ and K99- isolates. Ninety-five of the isolates (22%) hybridized with at least 1 enterotoxin gene probe (Ent+ isolates), and 82 (19%), with the K99 gene probe. The majority of Ent+ isolates (85%) reacted with probes for STaP and K99 genes. The STaP gene was present by itself in 4 of the Ent+ isolates (4%) and with the STb gene in 6 of the Ent+ isolates (6%). Five of the Ent+ isolates (5%) carried the STb and LT genes, and none (0%) of the isolates carried the STaH gene. All but 2 of the isolates with the K99 gene also had the STaP gene. Twenty-eight isolates shown to produce STa enterotoxin in previous studies failed to hybridize with any of the enterotoxin gene probes. These 28 isolates were also phenotypically negative when the tests for enterotoxin production were repeated. These isolates probably lost their genes for enterotoxin production during storage in the laboratory.",

        "Abstract": "The genome of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a linear, double-stranded molecule of DNA composed of a long (L) region covalently linked to a short (S) region. The S region is capable of inverting relative to a fixed orientation of the L region, giving rise to two equimolar populations. We have investigated other forms of the VZV genome which are present in infected cells and packaged into nucleocapsids. That a small proportion of nucleocapsid DNA molecules also possess inverted L regions has been verified by the identification of submolar restriction fragments corresponding to novel joints and novel ends generated by such an inversion. The presence of circular molecules has been investigated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bands corresponding to circular forms were present in small amounts in both VZV-infected cell DNA and nucleocapsid DNA. Southern blot analysis verified that these bands contained VZV sequences. We therefore conclude that the VZV genome may occasionally contain an inverted L region or exist in a circular configuration.",

DNA sequence analysis showed that the nucleotide sequence CCGCCGATGGGGAGGGGGCGCGGTACC is tandemly duplicated a variable number of times in different VZV strains and is responsible for the observed variation in mobilities of restriction fragments from this region of VZV DNA. The variable region sequence shares some homology with tandemly repeated regions in the a and c sequences of herpes simplex virus type 1 and probably exists in a noncoding region of the VZV genome.",

Portions of the IRS and TRS repeat sequences bounding the US region of the DNA were found to have a G + C content 10 to 20% greater than the overall 47% G + C content of the VZV genome. A stretch of DNA (approx. 1500 base pairs) at the UL-IRS junction and repeated at the terminus of the TRS sequences was found to be about 64% G + C, based on sedimentation equilibrium measurements. We also report the cloning of a novel fragment containing sequences from both the UL and TRS termini of the VZV genome. Our ability to clone this fragment suggests that unusual forms of VZV DNA including closed circular molecules and molecules with an inverted UL region can be packaged into nucleocapsids.",

The molecular termini of the DNA were identified by restriction enzyme analysis after exonuclease III digestion. The data indicate that VZV DNA exists in two isomeric forms that differ by inversion of one short terminal genome segment. Electron microscopic studies revealed that the short genome segment consists of a terminal revealed that the short genome segment consists of a terminal sequence of about 3.4 X 10(6) daltons that is separated from an internal inverted repeat of itself by a 5.8 X 10(60)-dalton unique DNA segment.",

        "Abstract": "Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA was prepared from nucleocapsids and from enveloped virions of a laboratory strain (Ellen) and directly from the vesicle fluids of patients with zoster infections. VZV Ellen nucleocapsid DNA was cleaved with 11 different restriction endonucleases and electrophoresed in agarose gels. The restriction profiles of the nucleocapsid DNA were identical to those of the DNA recovered from purified virions, but differed from those of another VZV strain (KM). In vitro-labeled VZV K.M. DNA purified directly from vesicle fluid yielded a distinct restriction pattern which appeared to be unchanged after several tissue culture passages of the isolate from that fluid. Restriction endonuclease analysis (EcoRI or BglII) of VZV DNA revealed the presence of four cleavage fragments with a molar ratio of approximately 0.5. No individual fragments with molar ratios of 0.25 were noted. This observation suggests that the VZV genome may contain one invertible segment. Comparison of the electrophoretic migrations of VZV DNA fragments relative to those of DNAs of known size permitted calculation of the VZV genome size to be 72 X 10(6) to 80 X 10(6) daltons. These results were confirmed by electron microscopy which demonstrated a genome size of about 76 X 10(6) daltons for passaged and unpassaged VZV DNA. Electron microscopy also revealed that some of the DNA molecules recovered from nucleocapsids or directly from vesicle fluids were superhelical circles.",

The drive mechanism of the trephine enables the surgeon to keep the central cutting axis of the instrument stable while the trephine is rotated. The instrument accepts variable sizes of disposable trephine blades, making it versatile and economical. We also devised a lamellar dissector with two blades to negate the splitting force that occurs during a closed lamellar dissection. It enables the surgeon to perform a closed lamellar dissection with minimal force applied to the globe and minimal risk of perforation.",

After clinical and pathological examination of the above cases, as well as a short review of the literature, the following points are made: (1) Some cases are congenital, being either familial or sporadic, but others are acquired. (2) The term \"posterior polymorphous keratopathy\" covers all the variants of the condition and is preferred to the traditional \"posterior polymorphous dystrophy\". (3) The congenital type is a mild variant of the mesodermal dysplasia, whereas the acquired type follows local disease. (4) The condition can be static, but over 50% of cases are slowly progressive, calling for penetrating keratoplasty.",

        "Abstract": "A series of 200 cases of full-thickness corneal allografts have been followed to determine whether HLA and ABO incompatibility influence prognosis of the grafts. 85% of patients with avascular corneas had clear, functioning grafts one year after transplantation. Only 33% of patients with severely vascularised corneas had successful grafts one year after transplantation. A significant association was found between severe vascularisation of the patient's cornea and irreversible graft rejection. In this group of patients, the proportion of grafts functioning was found to be ranked according to the number of HLA antigens shared by graft donor and recipient. Patients receiving grafts matching for 2 HLA antigens showed a failure-rate due to irreversible rejection of 26% at one year, in comparison with 57% and 62% of grafts matching for 1 or 0 HLA antigens respectively. ABO incompatibility or ABO phenotype of the recipient did not influence graft prognosis. The results indicate that patients with severely vascularised corneas should receive HLA-matched corneal grafts. The institution of HLA-typed cornea \"banks\" for treatment of such patients is advocated.",
