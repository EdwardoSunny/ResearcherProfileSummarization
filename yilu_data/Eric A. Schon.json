        "Abstract": "Genetic mutations causing primary mitochondrial disease (i.e those compromising oxidative phosphorylation [OxPhos]) resulting in reduced bioenergetic output display great variability in their clinical features, but the reason for this is unknown. We hypothesized that disruption of the communication between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM) might play a role in this variability. To test this, we assayed MAM function and ER-mitochondrial communication in OxPhos-deficient cells, including cybrids from patients with selected pathogenic mtDNA mutations. Our results show that each of the various mutations studied indeed altered MAM functions, but notably, each disorder presented with a different MAM \"signature\". We also found that mitochondrial membrane potential is a key driver of ER-mitochondrial connectivity. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that disruption in ER-mitochondrial communication has consequences for cell survivability that go well beyond that of reduced ATP output. The findings of a \"MAM-OxPhos\" axis, the role of mitochondrial membrane potential in controlling this process, and the contribution of MAM dysfunction to cell death, reveal a new relationship between mitochondria and the rest of the cell, as well as providing new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of these devastating disorders.",

        "Title": "Towards a Unitary Hypothesis of Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis.",
        "Abstract": "The \"amyloid cascade\" hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis invokes the accumulation in the brain of plaques (containing the amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor [A\u03b2PP] cleavage product amyloid-\u03b2 [A\u03b2]) and tangles (containing hyperphosphorylated tau) as drivers of pathogenesis. However, the poor track record of clinical trials based on this hypothesis suggests that the accumulation of these peptides is not the only cause of AD. Here, an alternative hypothesis is proposed in which the A\u03b2PP cleavage product C99, not A\u03b2, is the main culprit, via its role as a regulator of cholesterol metabolism. C99, which is a cholesterol sensor, promotes the formation of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAM), a cholesterol-rich lipid raft-like subdomain of the ER that communicates, both physically and biochemically, with mitochondria. We propose that in early-onset AD (EOAD), MAM-localized C99 is elevated above normal levels, resulting in increased transport of cholesterol from the plasma membrane to membranes of intracellular organelles, such as ER/endosomes, thereby upregulating MAM function and driving pathology. By the same token, late-onset AD (LOAD) is triggered by any genetic variant that increases the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol that, in turn, boosts the levels of C99 and again upregulates MAM function. Thus, the functional cause of AD is upregulated MAM function that, in turn, causes the hallmark disease phenotypes, including the plaques and tangles. Accordingly, the MAM hypothesis invokes two key interrelated elements, C99 and cholesterol, that converge at the MAM to drive AD pathogenesis. From this perspective, AD is, at bottom, a lipid disorder.",

        "Abstract": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 2A is a form of peripheral neuropathy, due almost exclusively to dominant mutations in the nuclear gene encoding the mitochondrial protein mitofusin-2 (MFN2). However, there is no understanding of the relationship of clinical phenotype to genotype. MFN2 has two functions: it promotes inter-mitochondrial fusion and mediates endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrial tethering at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM). MAM regulates a number of key cellular functions, including lipid and calcium homeostasis, and mitochondrial behavior. To date, no studies have been performed to address whether mutations in MFN2 in CMT2A patient cells affect MAM function, which might provide insight into pathogenesis. Using fibroblasts from three CMT2AMFN2 patients with different mutations in MFN2, we found that some, but not all, examined aspects of ER-mitochondrial connectivity and of MAM function were indeed altered, and correlated with disease severity. Notably, however, respiratory chain function in those cells was unimpaired. Our results suggest that CMT2AMFN2 is a MAM-related disorder but is not a respiratory chain-deficiency disease. The alterations in MAM function described here could also provide insight into the pathogenesis of other forms of CMT.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial respiratory deficiencies have been observed in numerous neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. For decades, these reductions in oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) have been presumed to trigger an overall bioenergetic crisis in the neuron, resulting in cell death. While the connection between respiratory defects and neuronal death has never been proven, this hypothesis has been supported by the detection of nonspecific mitochondrial DNA mutations in these disorders. These findings led to the notion that mitochondrial respiratory defects could be initiators of these common neurodegenerative disorders, instead of being consequences of a prior insult, a theory we believe to be misconstrued. Herein, we review the roots of this mitochondrial hypothesis and offer a new perspective wherein mitochondria are analyzed not only from the OxPhos point of view, but also as a complex organelle residing at the epicenter of many metabolic pathways.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial diseases produce profound neurological dysfunction via mutations affecting mitochondrial energy production, including the relatively common Leigh syndrome (LS). We recently described an LS case caused by a pathogenic mutation in USMG5, encoding a small supernumerary subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase. This protein is integral for ATP synthase dimerization, and patient fibroblasts revealed an almost total loss of ATP synthase dimers. Here, we utilize in situ cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) in a clinical case-control study of mitochondrial disease to directly study mitochondria within cultured fibroblasts from a patient with LS and a healthy human control subject. Through tomographic analysis of patient and control mitochondria, we find that loss of ATP synthase dimerization due to the pathogenic mutation causes profound disturbances of mitochondrial crista ultrastructure. Overall, this work supports the crucial role of ATP synthase in regulating crista architecture in the context of human disease.",

        "Title": "A key role for MAM in mediating mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer disease.",
        "Abstract": "In the last few years, increased emphasis has been devoted to understanding the contribution of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAM) to human pathology in general, and neurodegenerative diseases in particular. A major reason for this is the central role that this subdomain of the ER plays in metabolic regulation and in mitochondrial biology. As such, aberrant MAM function may help explain the seemingly unrelated metabolic abnormalities often seen in neurodegeneration. In the specific case of Alzheimer disease (AD), besides perturbations in calcium and lipid homeostasis, there are numerous documented alterations in mitochondrial behavior and function, including reduced respiratory chain activity and oxidative phosphorylation, increased free radical production, and altered organellar morphology, dynamics, and positioning (especially perinuclear mitochondria). However, whether these alterations are primary events causative of the disease, or are secondary downstream events that are the result of some other, more fundamental problem, is still unclear. In support of the former possibility, we recently reported that C99, the C-terminal processing product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) derived from its cleavage by \u03b2-secretase, is present in MAM, that its level is increased in AD, and that this increase reduces mitochondrial respiration, likely via a C99-induced alteration in cellular sphingolipid homeostasis. Thus, the metabolic disturbances seen in AD likely arise from increased ER-mitochondrial communication that is driven by an increase in the levels of C99 at the MAM.",

        "Abstract": "Recessive mutations in the mitochondrial copper-binding protein SCO2, cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly protein, have been reported in several cases with fatal infantile cardioencephalomyopathy with COX deficiency. Significantly expanding the known phenotypic spectrum, we identified compound heterozygous variants in SCO2 in two unrelated patients with axonal polyneuropathy, also known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4. Different from previously described cases, our patients developed predominantly motor neuropathy, they survived infancy, and they have not yet developed the cardiomyopathy that causes death in early infancy in reported patients. Both of our patients harbour missense mutations near the conserved copper-binding motif (CXXXC), including the common pathogenic variant E140K and a novel change D135G. In addition, each patient carries a second mutation located at the same loop region, resulting in compound heterozygote changes E140K/P169T and D135G/R171Q. Patient fibroblasts showed reduced levels of SCO2, decreased copper levels and COX deficiency. Given that another Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease gene, ATP7A, is a known copper transporter, our findings further underline the relevance of copper metabolism in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.",

        "Abstract": "In the amyloidogenic pathway associated with Alzheimer disease (AD), the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by \u03b2-secretase to generate a 99-aa C-terminal fragment (C99) that is then cleaved by \u03b3-secretase to generate the \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) found in senile plaques. In previous reports, we and others have shown that \u03b3-secretase activity is enriched in mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAM) and that ER-mitochondrial connectivity and MAM function are upregulated in AD We now show that C99, in addition to its localization in endosomes, can also be found in MAM, where it is normally processed rapidly by \u03b3-secretase. In cell models of AD, however, the concentration of unprocessed C99 increases in MAM regions, resulting in elevated sphingolipid turnover and an altered lipid composition of both MAM and mitochondrial membranes. In turn, this change in mitochondrial membrane composition interferes with the proper assembly and activity of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes, thereby likely contributing to the bioenergetic defects characteristic of AD.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial disorders affecting oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) are caused by mutations in both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. One promising candidate for treatment is the drug rapamycin, which has been shown to extend lifespan in multiple animal models, and which was previously shown to ameliorate mitochondrial disease in a knock-out mouse model lacking a nuclear-encoded gene specifying an OxPhos structural subunit (Ndufs4). In that model, relatively high-dose intraperitoneal rapamycin extended lifespan and improved markers of neurological disease, via an unknown mechanism. Here, we administered low-dose oral rapamycin to a knock-in (KI) mouse model of authentic mtDNA disease, specifically, progressive mtDNA depletion syndrome, resulting from a mutation in the mitochondrial nucleotide salvage enzyme thymidine kinase 2 (TK2). Importantly, low-dose oral rapamycin was sufficient to extend Tk2KI/KI mouse lifespan significantly, and did so in the absence of detectable improvements in mitochondrial dysfunction. We found no evidence that rapamycin increased survival by acting through canonical pathways, including mitochondrial autophagy. However, transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses uncovered systemic metabolic changes pointing to a potential 'rapamycin metabolic signature.' These changes also implied that rapamycin may have enabled the Tk2KI/KI mice to utilize alternative energy reserves, and possibly triggered indirect signaling events that modified mortality through developmental reprogramming. From a therapeutic standpoint, our results support the possibility that low-dose rapamycin, while not targeting the underlying mtDNA defect, could represent a crucial therapy for the treatment of mtDNA-driven, and some nuclear DNA-driven, mitochondrial diseases.",

However, there are other biochemical and morphological features of AD, including altered calcium, phospholipid, and cholesterol metabolism and altered mitochondrial dynamics and function that often appear early in the course of the disease, prior to plaque and tangle accumulation.

These MAM-localized functions are, in fact, increased significantly in various cellular and animal models of AD and in cells from AD patients, which could help explain the biochemical and morphological alterations seen in the disease. Based on these and other observations, a strong argument can be made that increased ER-mitochondria connectivity and increased MAM function are fundamental to AD pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently unclear and is the subject of much debate. The most widely accepted hypothesis designed to explain AD pathogenesis is the amyloid cascade, which invokes the accumulation of extracellular plaques and intracellular tangles as playing a fundamental role in the course and progression of the disease. However, besides plaques and tangles, other biochemical and morphological features are also present in AD, often manifesting early in the course of the disease before the accumulation of plaques and tangles. These include altered calcium, cholesterol, and phospholipid metabolism; altered mitochondrial dynamics; and reduced bioenergetic function. Notably, these other features of AD are associated with functions localized to a subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), known as mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs). The MAM region of the ER is a lipid raft-like domain closely apposed to mitochondria in such a way that the 2 organelles are able to communicate with each other, both physically and biochemically, thereby facilitating the functions of this region. We have found that MAM-localized functions are increased significantly in cellular and animal models of AD and in cells from patients with AD in a manner consistent with the biochemical findings noted above. Based on these and other observations, we propose that increased ER-mitochondrial apposition and perturbed MAM function lie at the heart of AD pathogenesis.-Area-Gomez, E., Schon, E. A.

        "Abstract": "Functional variability among human clones of induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) remains a limitation in assembling high-quality biorepositories. Beyond inter-person variability, the root cause of intra-person variability remains unknown. Mitochondria guide the required transition from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism in nuclear reprogramming. Moreover, mitochondria have their own genome (mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA]). Herein, we performed mtDNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) on 84 hiPSC clones derived from a cohort of 19 individuals, including mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial patients. The analysis of mtDNA variants showed that low levels of potentially pathogenic mutations in the original fibroblasts are revealed through nuclear reprogramming, generating mutant hiPSCs with a detrimental effect in their differentiated progeny. Specifically, hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes with expanded mtDNA mutations non-related with any described human disease, showed impaired mitochondrial respiration, being a potential cause of intra-person hiPSC variability. We propose mtDNA NGS as a new selection criterion to ensure hiPSC quality for drug discovery and regenerative medicine.",

The most widely accepted hypothesis is called the amyloid cascade, based on the observation that the brains of AD patients contain high levels of extracellular plaques, composed mainly of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), and intracellular tangles, composed of hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau. However, AD is also characterized by other features, including aberrant cholesterol, phospholipid, and calcium metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction, all ostensibly unrelated to plaque and tangle formation. Notably, these 'other' aspects of AD pathology are functions related to mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM), a subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is apposed to, and communicates with, mitochondria. Given the potential relationship between MAM and AD, we explored the possibility that perturbed MAM function might play a role in AD pathogenesis. We found that \u03b3-secretase activity, which processes the amyloid precursor protein to generate A\u03b2, is located predominantly in the MAM, and that ER-mitochondrial apposition and MAM function are increased significantly in cells from AD patients. These observations may help explain not only the aberrant A\u03b2 production, but also many of the 'other' biochemical and morphological features of the disease. Based on these, and other, data we propose that AD is fundamentally a disorder of ER-mitochondrial hyperconnectivity.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is linked to both cigarette smoking and genetic determinants. We have previously identified iron-responsive element-binding protein 2 (IRP2) as an important COPD susceptibility gene and have shown that IRP2 protein is increased in the lungs of individuals with COPD. Here we demonstrate that mice deficient in Irp2 were protected from cigarette smoke (CS)-induced experimental COPD. By integrating RNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (RIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and gene expression and functional enrichment clustering analysis, we identified Irp2 as a regulator of mitochondrial function in the lungs of mice. Irp2 increased mitochondrial iron loading and levels of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which led to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent experimental COPD. Frataxin-deficient mice, which had higher mitochondrial iron loading, showed impaired airway mucociliary clearance (MCC) and higher pulmonary inflammation at baseline, whereas mice deficient in the synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase, which have reduced COX, were protected from CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and impairment of MCC. Mice treated with a mitochondrial iron chelator or mice fed a low-iron diet were protected from CS-induced COPD. Mitochondrial iron chelation also alleviated CS-induced impairment of MCC, CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and CS-associated lung injury in mice with established COPD, suggesting a critical functional role and potential therapeutic intervention for the mitochondrial-iron axis in COPD.",

        "Abstract": "In addition to the appearance of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by aberrant lipid metabolism and early mitochondrial dysfunction. We recently showed that there was increased functionality of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAM), a subdomain of the ER involved in lipid and cholesterol homeostasis, in presenilin-deficient cells and in fibroblasts from familial and sporadic AD patients. Individuals carrying the \u03b54 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE4) are at increased risk for developing AD compared to those carrying ApoE3. While the reason for this increased risk is unknown, we hypothesized that it might be associated with elevated MAM function. Using an astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM) model, we now show that ER-mitochondrial communication and MAM function-as measured by the synthesis of phospholipids and of cholesteryl esters, respectively-are increased significantly in cells treated with ApoE4-containing ACM as compared to those treated with ApoE3-containing ACM. Notably, this effect was seen with lipoprotein-enriched preparations, but not with lipid-free ApoE protein. These data are consistent with a role of upregulated MAM function in the pathogenesis of AD and may help explain, in part, the contribution of ApoE4 as a risk factor in the disease.",

        "Abstract": "SCO2 mutations cause recessively inherited cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. Recently Tran-Viet et al. proposed that heterozygosity for pathogenic SCO2 variants, including the common E140K variant, causes high-grade myopia. To investigate the association of SCO2 mutations with myopia, ophthalmic examinations were performed on 35 E140K carriers, one homozygous infant, and on a mouse model of Sco2 deficiency. Additionally, a screen for other putative effects of SCO2 heterozygosity was carried out by comparing the prevalence of the common E140K variant in a population of patients with undiagnosed diseases compatible with SCO2-related pathogenesis to that in a general population sample. High-grade myopia was not identified in any of the studied individuals. Of the carriers, 17 were emmetropic, and 18 possessed refractive errors. Additionally, no significant axial elongation indicative of high-grade myopia was found in mice carrying E129K (corresponding to E140K in humans) knock-in mutations. The prevalence of E140K carriers in the symptomatic cohort was evaluated as 1:103 (CI: 0.44-2.09) and did not differ significantly from the population prevalence (1:147, CI: 0.45-1.04).Our study demonstrates that heterozygosity for pathogenic SCO2 variants is not associated with high-grade myopia in either human patients or in mice.",

        "Abstract": "A key component of eukaryotic lipid homeostasis is the esterification of sterols with fatty acids by sterol O-acyltransferases (SOATs). The esterification reactions are allosterically activated by their sterol substrates, the majority of which accumulate at the plasma membrane. We demonstrate that in yeast, sterol transport from the plasma membrane to the site of esterification is associated with the physical interaction of the major SOAT, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT)-related enzyme (Are)2p, with 2 plasma membrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters: Aus1p and Pdr11p. Are2p, Aus1p, and Pdr11p, unlike the minor acyltransferase, Are1p, colocalize to sterol and sphingolipid-enriched, detergent-resistant microdomains (DRMs). Deletion of either ABC transporter results in Are2p relocalization to detergent-soluble membrane domains and a significant decrease (53-36%) in esterification of exogenous sterol. Similarly, in murine tissues, the SOAT1/Acat1 enzyme and activity localize to DRMs. This subcellular localization is diminished upon deletion of murine ABC transporters, such as Abcg1, which itself is DRM associated. We propose that the close proximity of sterol esterification and transport proteins to each other combined with their residence in lipid-enriched membrane microdomains facilitates rapid, high-capacity sterol transport and esterification, obviating any requirement for soluble intermediary proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Familial cases of Parkinson's disease (PD) can be associated with overexpression or mutation of \u03b1-synuclein, a synaptic protein reported to be localized mainly in the cytosol and mitochondria. We recently showed that wild-type \u03b1-synuclein is not present in mitochondria, as previously thought, but rather is located in mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Remarkably, we also found that PD-related mutated \u03b1-synuclein results in its reduced association with mitochondria-associated membranes, coincident with a lower degree of apposition of endoplasmic reticulum with mitochondria and an increase in mitochondrial fragmentation, as compared with wild-type. This new subcellular localization of \u03b1-synuclein raises fundamental questions regarding the relationship of \u03b1-synuclein to mitochondria-associated membranes function, in both normal and pathological states. In this article, we attempt to relate aspects of PD pathogenesis to what is known about mitochondria-associated membranes' behavior and function. We hypothesize that early events occurring in dopaminergic neurons at the level of the mitochondria-associated membranes could cause long-term disturbances that lead to PD.",

        "Title": "Cardiac deficiency of single cytochrome oxidase assembly factor scox induces p53-dependent apoptosis in a Drosophila cardiomyopathy model.",
        "Abstract": "The heart is a muscle with high energy demands. Hence, most patients with mitochondrial disease produced by defects in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system are susceptible to cardiac involvement. The presentation of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy includes hypertrophic, dilated and left ventricular noncompaction, but the molecular mechanisms involved in cardiac impairment are unknown. One of the most frequent OXPHOS defects in humans frequently associated with cardiomyopathy is cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency caused by mutations in COX assembly factors such as Sco1 and Sco2. To investigate the molecular mechanisms that underlie the cardiomyopathy associated with Sco deficiency, we have heart specifically interfered scox expression, the single Drosophila Sco orthologue. Cardiac-specific knockdown of scox reduces fly lifespan, and it severely compromises heart function and structure, producing dilated cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyocytes with low levels of scox have a significant reduction in COX activity and they undergo a metabolic switch from OXPHOS to glycolysis, mimicking the clinical features found in patients harbouring Sco mutations. The major cardiac defects observed are produced by a significant increase in apoptosis, which is dp53-dependent. Genetic and molecular evidence strongly suggest that dp53 is directly involved in the development of the cardiomyopathy induced by scox deficiency. Remarkably, apoptosis is enhanced in the muscle and liver of Sco2 knock-out mice, clearly suggesting that cell death is a key feature of the COX deficiencies produced by mutations in Sco genes in humans.",

        "Abstract": "\u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) is one of the genes that when mutated or overexpressed causes Parkinson's Disease (PD). Initially, it was described as a synaptic terminal protein and later was found to be localized at mitochondria. Mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) have emerged as a central endoplasmic reticulum (ER) subcellular compartments where key functions of the cell occur. These domains, enriched in cholesterol and anionic phospholipids, are where calcium homeostasis, lipid transfer, and cholesterol metabolism are regulated. Some proteins, related to mitochondrial dynamics and function, are also localized to this area. Several neurodegenerative diseases have shown alterations in MAM functions and resident proteins, including Charcot Marie-Tooth and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have recently reported that MAM function is downregulated in cell and mouse models of PD expressing pathogenic mutations of \u03b1-syn. This review focuses on the possible role of \u03b1-syn in these cellular domains and the early pathogenic features of PD that could be explained by \u03b1-syn-MAM disturbances.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial disorders are highly heterogeneous conditions characterized by defects of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Pharmacological activation of mitochondrial biogenesis has been proposed as an effective means to correct the biochemical defects and ameliorate the clinical phenotype in these severely disabling, often fatal, disorders. Pathways related to mitochondrial biogenesis are targets of Sirtuin1, a NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase. As NAD(+) boosts the activity of Sirtuin1 and other sirtuins, intracellular levels of NAD(+) play a key role in the homeostatic control of mitochondrial function by the metabolic status of the cell. We show here that supplementation with nicotinamide riboside, a natural NAD(+) precursor, or reduction of NAD(+) consumption by inhibiting the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, leads to marked improvement of the respiratory chain defect and exercise intolerance of the Sco2 knockout/knockin mouse, a mitochondrial disease model characterized by impaired cytochrome c oxidase biogenesis. This strategy is potentially translatable into therapy of mitochondrial disorders in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Familial Parkinson disease is associated with mutations in \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), a presynaptic protein that has been localized not only to the cytosol, but also to mitochondria. We report here that wild-type \u03b1-syn from cell lines, and brain tissue from humans and mice, is present not in mitochondria but rather in mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAM), a structurally and functionally distinct subdomain of the ER. Remarkably, we found that pathogenic point mutations in human \u03b1-syn result in its reduced association with MAM, coincident with a lower degree of apposition of ER with mitochondria, a decrease in MAM function, and an increase in mitochondrial fragmentation compared with wild-type. Although overexpression of wild-type \u03b1-syn in mutant \u03b1-syn-expressing cells reverted the fragmentation phenotype, neither overexpression of the mitochondrial fusion/MAM-tethering protein MFN2 nor inhibition/ablation of the mitochondrial fission protein DRP1 was able to do so, implying that \u03b1-syn operates downstream of the mitochondrial fusion/fission machinery. These novel results indicate that wild-type \u03b1-syn localizes to the MAM and modulates mitochondrial morphology, and that these behaviors are impaired by pathogenic mutations in \u03b1-syn. We believe that our results have far-reaching implications for both our understanding of \u03b1-syn biology and the treatment of synucleinopathies.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial diseases involve the respiratory chain, which is under the dual control of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The complexity of mitochondrial genetics provides one explanation for the clinical heterogeneity of mitochondrial diseases, but our understanding of disease pathogenesis remains limited. Classification of Mendelian mitochondrial encephalomyopathies has been laborious, but whole-exome sequencing studies have revealed unexpected molecular aetiologies for both typical and atypical mitochondrial disease phenotypes. Mendelian mitochondrial defects can affect five components of mitochondrial biology: subunits of respiratory chain complexes (direct hits); mitochondrial assembly proteins; mtDNA translation; phospholipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane; or mitochondrial dynamics. A sixth category-defects of mtDNA maintenance-combines features of Mendelian and mitochondrial genetics. Genetic defects in mitochondrial dynamics are especially important in neurology as they cause optic atrophy, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Therapy is inadequate and mostly palliative, but promising new avenues are being identified. Here, we review current knowledge on the genetics and pathogenesis of the six categories of mitochondrial disorders outlined above, focusing on their salient clinical manifestations and highlighting novel clinical entities. An outline of diagnostic clues for the various forms of mitochondrial disease, as well as potential therapeutic strategies, is also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) consists of a group of complex developmental disabilities characterized by impaired social interactions, deficits in communication and repetitive behavior. Multiple lines of evidence implicate mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD. In postmortem BA21 temporal cortex, a region that exhibits synaptic pathology in ASD, we found that compared to controls, ASD patients exhibited altered protein levels of mitochondria respiratory chain protein complexes, decreased Complex I and IV activities, decreased mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme SOD2, and greater oxidative DNA damage. Mitochondrial membrane mass was higher in ASD brain, as indicated by higher protein levels of mitochondrial membrane proteins Tom20, Tim23 and porin. No differences were observed in either mitochondrial DNA or levels of the mitochondrial gene transcription factor TFAM or cofactor PGC1\u03b1, indicating that a mechanism other than alterations in mitochondrial genome or mitochondrial biogenesis underlies these mitochondrial abnormalities. We further identified higher levels of the mitochondrial fission proteins (Fis1 and Drp1) and decreased levels of the fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and Opa1) in ASD patients, indicating altered mitochondrial dynamics in ASD brain. Many of these changes were evident in cortical pyramidal neurons, and were observed in ASD children but were less pronounced or absent in adult patients. Together, these findings provide evidence that mitochondrial function and intracellular redox status are compromised in pyramidal neurons in ASD brain and that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs during early childhood when ASD symptoms appear.",

        "Title": "Mitochondria-associated ER membranes in Alzheimer disease.",
        "Abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is associated with the accumulation in the brain of extracellular neuritic plaques composed mainly of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau. It is also associated with other features that have received less attention, including aberrant phospholipid, cholesterol, and calcium metabolism, and altered mitochondrial function and dynamics. The underlying mechanism(s) that might explain these observations are currently unknown. We recently showed that presenilin-1 (PS1), presenilin-2 (PS2), and \u03b3-secretase activity, which processes the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate A\u03b2, are located predominantly in a specialized subcompartment of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is physically and biochemically connected to mitochondria, called mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM). MAM is an intracellular lipid raft-like structure intimately involved in cholesterol and phospholipid lipid metabolism, in calcium homeostasis, and in mitochondrial function and dynamics. The coincidence of the functions associated with MAM with the symptomatology of AD led us to speculate that presenilins play a role in maintaining MAM function. We found that, consistent with this supposition, both MAM function and ER-mitochondrial connectivity are increased significantly in AD, which may help explain many of the biochemical and morphological features of the disease. Based on these findings, we propose that AD is fundamentally a disorder of ER-mitochondrial communication (the \"MAM hypothesis\").

We now show that MAM function and ER-mitochondrial communication-as measured by cholesteryl ester and phospholipid synthesis, respectively-are increased significantly in presenilin-mutant cells and in fibroblasts from patients with both the familial and sporadic forms of AD. We also show that MAM is an intracellular detergent-resistant lipid raft (LR)-like domain, consistent with the known presence of presenilins and \u03b3-secretase activity in rafts. These findings may help explain not only the aberrant APP processing but also a number of other biochemical features of AD, including altered lipid metabolism and calcium homeostasis. We propose that upregulated MAM function at the ER-mitochondrial interface, and increased cross-talk between these two organelles, may play a hitherto unrecognized role in the pathogenesis of AD.",

        "Abstract": "Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) catalyzes the last step in respiration, transferring electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen and coupling electron transfer with proton translocation from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space. COX is composed of 13 subunits, three larger catalytic subunits encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and ten subunits encoded by nuclear DNA. Clinically heterogeneous human diseases were attributed to COX deficiency since the 1970s, mostly based on histochemical or biochemical data in muscle biopsies. Here, we revisit the COX deficiencies described before the molecular era, assess the value of COX histochemistry in conjunction with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) stain, and review the clinical presentations of primary COX deficiencies defined at the molecular level. In general, mutations in mtDNA COX genes are associated with milder and later onset clinical syndromes, probably due to heteroplasmy. Mutations affecting nuclear-encoded COX subunits (\"direct hits\") are extremely rare whereas mutations affecting assembly proteins (\"indirect hits\") account for most COX deficiencies and the list keeps growing. Onset is generally in infancy and survival into adolescence or adult life is infrequent. The most common neurological disorder is Leigh syndrome, either alone or associated with cardiopathy, hepatopathy, or nephropathy.",

        "Abstract": "Characterization of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mutations is crucial for disease diagnosis, which requires accurate and sensitive detection methods and quantification due to mitochondrial heteroplasmy. We report here the characterization of mutations for myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers syndrome using chemically cleavable biotinylated dideoxynucleotides and a mass spectrometry (MS)-based solid phase capture (SPC) single base extension (SBE) assay. The method effectively eliminates unextended primers and primer dimers, and the presence of cleavable linkers between the base and biotin allows efficient desalting and release of the DNA products from solid phase for MS analysis. This approach is capable of high multiplexing, and the use of different length linkers for each of the purines and each of the pyrimidines permits better discrimination of the four bases by MS. Both homoplasmic and heteroplasmic genotypes were accurately determined on different mtDNA samples. The specificity of the method for mtDNA detection was validated by using mitochondrial DNA-negative cells. The sensitivity of the approach permitted detection of less than 5% mtDNA heteroplasmy levels. This indicates that the SPC-SBE approach based on chemically cleavable biotinylated dideoxynucleotides and MS enables rapid, accurate, and sensitive genotyping of mtDNA and has broad applications for genetic analysis.",

During macroautophagy, a double-membraned cup-shaped structure engulfs cytosolic content. This autophagic vesicle then fuses with lysosomes, allowing hydrolytic enzymes to degrade the contents. Mitochondrial autophagy, or mitophagy, is thought to degrade damaged or nonfunctioning mitochondria specifically. The Parkinson disease-related proteins PINK1 (a mitochondrially localized kinase) and PARK2 (PARKIN, a cytosolically-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase) are essential for targeting mitochondria for mitophagy. Upon chemical uncoupling of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (\u0394\u03c8(m)), PINK1 located in the mitochondrial outer membrane recruits PARK2 from the cytosol to the mitochondria, followed by delivery of the organelle to the autophagic machinery for degradation.",

        "Abstract": "Autophagy has emerged as a key cellular process for organellar quality control, yet this pathway apparently fails to eliminate mitochondria containing pathogenic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in patients with a variety of human diseases. In order to explore how mtDNA-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction interacts with endogenous autophagic pathways, we examined autophagic status in a panel of human cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cell lines carrying a variety of pathogenic mtDNA mutations. We found that both genetic- and chemically induced loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (\u0394\u03c8(m)) caused recruitment of the pro-mitophagic factor Parkin to mitochondria. Strikingly, however, the loss of \u0394\u03c8(m) alone was insufficient to prompt delivery of mitochondria to the autophagosome (mitophagy). We found that mitophagy could be induced following treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin in cybrids carrying either large-scale partial deletions of mtDNA or complete depletion of mtDNA. Further, we found that the level of endogenous Parkin is a crucial determinant of mitophagy. These results suggest a two-hit model, in which the synergistic induction of both (i) mitochondrial recruitment of Parkin following the loss of \u0394\u03c8(m) and (ii) mTORC1-controlled general macroautophagy is required for mitophagy. It appears that mitophagy can be accomplished by the endogenous autophagic machinery, but requires the full engagement of both of these pathways.",

        "Abstract": "Increased mitochondrial biogenesis by activation of PPAR- or AMPK/PGC-1\u03b1-dependent homeostatic pathways has been proposed as a treatment for mitochondrial disease. We tested this hypothesis on three recombinant mouse models characterized by defective cytochrome c-oxidase (COX) activity:\u00a0a knockout (KO) mouse for Surf1, a knockout/knockin mouse for Sco2, and a muscle-restricted KO mouse for Cox15. First, we demonstrated that double-recombinant animals overexpressing PGC-1\u03b1 in skeletal muscle on a Surf1 KO background showed robust induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and increase of mitochondrial respiratory chain activities, including COX. No such effect was obtained by treating both Surf1(-/-) and Cox15(-/-) mice with the pan-PPAR agonist bezafibrate, which instead showed adverse effects in either model. Contrariwise, treatment with the AMPK agonist AICAR led to partial correction of COX deficiency in all three models, and, importantly, significant motor improvement up to normal in the Sco2(KO/KI) mouse. These results open new perspectives for therapy of mitochondrial disease.",

        "Abstract": "Adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders are disabling and often fatal diseases of the nervous system whose underlying mechanisms of cell death remain unknown. Defects in mitochondrial respiration had previously been proposed to contribute to the occurrence of many, if not all, of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. However, the discovery of genes mutated in hereditary forms of these enigmatic diseases has additionally suggested defects in mitochondrial dynamics. Such disturbances can lead to changes in mitochondrial trafficking, in interorganellar communication, and in mitochondrial quality control. These new mechanisms by which mitochondria may also be linked to neurodegeneration will likely have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Adriamycin (ADR) is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent that also produces significant tissue damage. Mutations to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and reductions in mtDNA copy number have been identified as contributors to ADR-induced injury. ADR nephropathy only occurs among specific mouse inbred strains, and this selective susceptibility to kidney injury maps as a recessive trait to chromosome 16A1-B1. Here, we found that sensitivity to ADR nephropathy in mice was produced by a mutation in the Prkdc gene, which encodes a critical nuclear DNA double-stranded break repair protein. This finding was confirmed in mice with independent Prkdc mutations. Overexpression of Prkdc in cultured mouse podocytes significantly improved cell survival after ADR treatment. While Prkdc protein was not detected in mitochondria, mice with Prkdc mutations showed marked mtDNA depletion in renal tissue upon ADR treatment. To determine whether Prkdc participates in mtDNA regulation, we tested its genetic interaction with Mpv17, which encodes a mitochondrial protein mutated in human mtDNA depletion syndromes (MDDSs). While single mutant mice were asymptomatic, Prkdc/Mpv17 double-mutant mice developed mtDNA depletion and recapitulated many MDDS and ADR injury phenotypes. These findings implicate mtDNA damage in the development of ADR toxicity and identify Prkdc as a MDDS modifier gene and a component of the mitochondrial genome maintenance pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Mammalian SCO1 and SCO2 are evolutionarily-related copper-binding proteins that are required for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a mitochondrial respiratory chain complex, but the exact roles that they play in the assembly process are unclear. Mutations in both SCO1 and SCO2 are associated with distinct clinical phenotypes as well as tissue-specific COX deficiency, but the reason for such tissue specificity is unknown. We show in this study that although both genes are expressed ubiquitously in all mouse and human tissues examined, surprisingly, SCO1 localizes predominantly to blood vessels, whereas SCO2 is barely detectable in this tissue. To our knowledge, SCO1 is the first known example of a mitochondrial protein that is strongly expressed in the vasculature. We also show that the expression of SCO1, but not of SCO2, is very high in liver (the tissue most affected in SCO1-mutant patients), whereas the reverse holds true in muscle (the tissue most affected in SCO2-mutant patients). Our findings may help explain the differences in clinical presentations due to mutations in SCO1 and SCO2 and provide clues regarding the partially nonoverlapping functions of these two proteins.",

The obstacles to treating diseases caused by mutations in either mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA (nDNA), and which had the potential to affect nearly every organ system, seemed overwhelming. However, although clinically applicable therapies remain largely in the future, the landscape has changed dramatically and we can now envision the possibility of treating some of these disorders.

We have discovered that mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) - a specialized subcompartment of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) involved in lipid metabolism and calcium homeostasis that physically connects ER to mitochondria - is the predominant subcellular location for PS1 and PS2, and for gamma-secretase activity. We hypothesize that presenilins play a role in maintaining MAM function, and that not only altered amyloid-beta levels and hyperphosphorylated tau, but also many other features of AD (e.g., altered phospholipid and cholesterol metabolism, aberrant calcium homeostasis, and abnormal mitochondrial dynamics) result from compromised MAM function. The localization of presenilins and gamma-secretase in MAM may help reconcile disparate ideas regarding the pathogenesis of AD, under a unifying hypothesis that could explain many features of both sporadic and familial AD, thereby taking AD research in a new and fruitful direction.",

        "Abstract": "Phosphorylation of respiratory chain components has emerged as a mode of regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism, but its mechanisms are still largely unexplored. A recently discovered intramitochondrial signalling pathway links CO(2) generated by the Krebs cycle with the respiratory chain, through the action of a mitochondrial soluble adenylyl cyclase (mt-sAC). Cytochrome oxidase (COX), whose deficiency causes a number of fatal metabolic disorders, is a key mitochondrial enzyme activated by mt-sAC. We have now discovered that the mt-sAC pathway modulates mitochondrial biogenesis in a reactive oxygen species dependent manner, in cultured cells and in animals with COX deficiency. We show that upregulation of mt-sAC normalizes reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby restoring mitochondrial function. This is the first example of manipulation of a mitochondrial signalling pathway to achieve a direct positive modulation of COX, with clear implications for the development of novel approaches to treat mitochondrial diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in SCO2, a protein required for the proper assembly and functioning of cytochrome c oxidase (COX; complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain), cause a fatal infantile cardioencephalomyopathy with COX deficiency. We have generated mice harboring a Sco2 knock-out (KO) allele and a Sco2 knock-in (KI) allele expressing an E-->K mutation at position 129 (E129K), corresponding to the E140K mutation found in almost all human SCO2-mutated patients. Whereas homozygous KO mice were embryonic lethals, homozygous KI and compound heterozygous KI/KO mice were viable, but had muscle weakness; biochemically, they had respiratory chain deficiencies as well as complex IV assembly defects in multiple tissues. There was a concomitant reduction in mitochondrial copper content, but the total amount of copper in examined tissues was not reduced. These mouse models should be of use in further studies of Sco2 function, as well as in testing therapeutic approaches to treat the human disorder.",

Using three complementary approaches, subcellular fractionation, gamma-secretase activity assays, and immunocytochemistry, we show that presenilins are highly enriched in a subcompartment of the endoplasmic reticulum that is associated with mitochondria and that forms a physical bridge between the two organelles, called endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria-associated membranes. A localization of PS1 and PS2 in mitochondria-associated membranes may help reconcile the disparate hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease and may explain many seemingly unrelated features of this devastating neurodegenerative disorder.",

        "Abstract": "Emerging research shows that the packaging of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into protein-DNA assemblies called nucleoids confers higher-order organization to the mitochondrial genome. Studies of nucleoid composition, structure and dynamics reveal the mitochondrial nucleoid to be tightly regulated in its genetic autonomy, macromolecular organization and distribution throughout the cell. Our recent research shows that mitochondrial nucleoids are self-contained genetic entities that do not exchange mtDNAs with each other frequently. This suggests that the genetic composition of a cell's nucleoids will be the key determinant of the cell's mtDNA dynamics, and provides a mechanistic basis for therapeutic methods to rescue dysfunction due to mutations in mtDNA.",

        "Title": "Functional complementation of mitochondrial DNAs: mobilizing mitochondrial genetics against dysfunction.",
        "Abstract": "Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a 16.6-kb circular genome that is typically found in approximately 1000 copies per cell. Frequently, one or more forms of mtDNA (i.e. wildtype (WT) and one or more mutant variants) will co-exist within an individual cell, a situation termed heteroplasmy; however, it has been unclear how different mitochondria and mtDNA populations interact functionally in a heteroplasmic cell system. Using sequence-specific microscopic methods to examine mtDNA at suborganellar resolution, we examined the submitochondrial organization of mtDNA heteroplasmy in nucleoids, the DNA-protein complexes that organize and package mtDNA. Our recent results reveal that, while heterologous mtDNAs are generally maintained stably in separate nucleoid populations, the two mtDNAs transcomplement each other to restore WT-like levels of mitochondrial function and morphology. These findings reveal that the diffusion of mtDNA-derived transcripts through the mitochondrial matrix allows for transcomplementation, despite the apparent genetic autonomy of nucleoids. The fundamental ability of mtDNAs to complement each other within the matrix of the mitochondrial network provides a mechanistic basis for therapeutic strategies designed to restore mitochondrial function in heteroplasmic cells by increasing WT mtDNA content, particularly in light of the emerging connection between the processes of mitochondrial fission/fusion and mtDNA nucleoid organization.",

In addition, these bacteria may be able to transfer genes within cells while protected from the action of drugs. The primary mode by which virulence and antibiotic resistance genes are spread is bacterial conjugation. Salmonellae have been shown to be competent for conjugation in the vacuoles of cultured mammalian cells. We now show that the conjugation machinery is also functional in the mammalian cytosol. Specially constructed Escherichia coli strains expressing Shigella flexneri plasmid and chromosomal virulence factors for escape from vacuoles and synthesizing the invasin protein from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis to enhance cellular entry were able to enter 3T3 cells and escape from the phagocytic vacuole. One bacterial strain (the donor) of each pair to be introduced sequentially into mammalian cells had a conjugative plasmid. We found that this plasmid could be transferred at high frequency. Conjugation in the cytoplasm of cells may well be a general phenomenon.",

Efforts in deducing the PINK1 signaling pathway have been hindered by controversy around its subcellular and submitochondrial localization and the authenticity of its reported substrates. We show here that this mitochondrial protein exhibits a topology in which the kinase domain faces the cytoplasm and the N-terminal tail is inside the mitochondria. Although deletion of the transmembrane domain disrupts this topology, common PD-linked PINK1 mutations do not. These results are critical in rectifying the location and orientation of PINK1 in mitochondria, and they should help decipher its normal physiological function and potential pathogenic role in PD.",

        "Title": "Mitochondrial nucleoids maintain genetic autonomy but allow for functional complementation.",
        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is packaged into DNA-protein assemblies called nucleoids, but the mode of mtDNA propagation via the nucleoid remains controversial. Two mechanisms have been proposed: nucleoids may consistently maintain their mtDNA content faithfully, or nucleoids may exchange mtDNAs dynamically. To test these models directly, two cell lines were fused, each homoplasmic for a partially deleted mtDNA in which the deletions were nonoverlapping and each deficient in mitochondrial protein synthesis, thus allowing the first unequivocal visualization of two mtDNAs at the nucleoid level. The two mtDNAs transcomplemented to restore mitochondrial protein synthesis but were consistently maintained in discrete nucleoids that did not intermix stably. These results indicate that mitochondrial nucleoids tightly regulate their genetic content rather than freely exchanging mtDNAs. This genetic autonomy provides a molecular mechanism to explain patterns of mitochondrial genetic inheritance, in addition to facilitating therapeutic methods to eliminate deleterious mtDNA mutations.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) tRNA genes can be considered functionally recessive because they result in a clinical or biochemical phenotype only when the percentage of mutant molecules exceeds a critical threshold value, in the range of 70-90%. We report a novel mtDNA mutation that contradicts this rule, since it caused a severe multisystem disorder and respiratory chain (RC) deficiency even at low levels of heteroplasmy. We studied a 13-year-old boy with clinical, radiological and biochemical evidence of a mitochondrial disorder. We detected a novel heteroplasmic C>T mutation at nucleotide 5545 of mtDNA, which was present at unusually low levels (<25%) in affected tissues. The pathogenic threshold for the mutation in cybrids was between 4 and 8%, implying a dominant mechanism of action. The mutation affects the central base of the anticodon triplet of tRNA(Trp) and it may alter the codon specificity of the affected tRNA. These findings introduce the concept of dominance in mitochondrial genetics and pose new diagnostic challenges, because such mutations may easily escape detection. Moreover, similar mutations arising stochastically and accumulating in a minority of mtDNA molecules during the aging process may severely impair RC function in cells.",

However, other mitochondrial functions are greatly important for the nervous system, including protein importation, organellar dynamics, and programmed cell death. Defects in genes controlling these functions are attracting increasing attention as causes not only of neurological (and psychiatric) diseases but also of age-related neurodegenerative disorders. After discussing some pathogenic conundrums regarding the neurological manifestations of the respiratory chain defects, we review altered mitochondrial dynamics in the etiology of specific neurological diseases and in the physiopathology of more common neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "Title": "Does premature aging of the mtDNA mutator mouse prove that mtDNA mutations are involved in natural aging?",
        "Abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that transgenic mice with an increased rate of somatic point mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA mutator mice) display a premature aging phenotype reminiscent of human aging. These results are widely interpreted as implying that mtDNA mutations may be a central mechanism in mammalian aging. However, the levels of mutations in the mutator mice typically are more than an order of magnitude higher than typical levels in aged humans. Furthermore, most of the aging-like features are not specific to the mtDNA mutator mice, but are shared with several other premature aging mouse models, where no mtDNA mutations are involved. We conclude that, although mtDNA mutator mouse is a very useful model for studies of phenotypes associated with mtDNA mutations, the aging-like phenotypes of the mouse do not imply that mtDNA mutations are necessarily involved in natural mammalian aging. On the other hand, the fact that point mutations in aged human tissues are much less abundant than those causing premature aging in mutator mice does not mean that mtDNA mutations are not involved in human aging. Thus, mtDNA mutations may indeed be relevant to human aging, but they probably differ by origin, type, distribution, and spectra of affected tissues from those observed in mutator mice.",

        "Abstract": "Therapy for mitochondrial diseases is woefully inadequate. However, lack of a cure does not equate with lack of treatment. Palliative therapy is dictated by good medical practice and includes anticonvulsant medication, control of endocrine dysfunction, and surgical procedures. Removal of noxious metabolites is centered on combating lactic acidosis, but extends to other metabolites. Attempts to bypass blocks in the respiratory chain by administration of electron acceptors have not been successful, but this may be amenable to genetic engineering. Administration of metabolites and cofactors is the mainstay of real-life therapy and is especially important in disorders due to primary deficiencies of specific compounds, such as carnitine or coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). There is increasing interest in the administration of reactive oxygen radicals (ROS) scavengers, both in primary mitochondrial diseases and in neurodegenerative diseases. Gene therapy is a challenge because of polyplasmy and heteroplasmy, but novel experimental approaches are being pursued. One important strategy is to decrease the ratio of mutant to wild-type mitochondrial genomes (\"gene shifting\") by different means: (1) converting mutated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes into normal nuclear DNA genes (\"allotopic expression\"); (2) importing cognate genes from other species (\"xenotopic expression\"); (3) correcting mtDNA mutations by importing specific restriction endonucleases; (4) selecting for respiratory function; and (5) inducing muscle regeneration. Germline therapy raises ethical problems but is being considered for prevention of maternal transmission of mtDNA mutations. Preventive therapy through genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis is becoming increasingly important for nuclear DNA-related disorders.",

        "Abstract": "L-citrulline, classified as a nonessential amino acid, is synthesized predominantly via Delta-1-pyrroline carboxylate synthase in the endothelial cells of the small intestine. In mammals, small quantities of citrulline are also produced in nitric oxide synthase-expressing cells. Considering the fact that the enzymes involved in the endogenous synthesis of L-citrulline are all located in the mitochondria and the fact that citrulline is a component of the citrulline-nitric oxide (NO) cycle, we hypothesized that the distinct clinical, biochemical, and morphological characteristics of MELAS, a maternally inherited mitochondrial disorder, might be due to alterations in nitric oxide homeostasis. Analysis of serum from MELAS patients showed that levels of plasma arginine were similar in both patients and in controls. However, levels of citrulline in MELAS patients were significantly lower than in controls, and there was a clear inverse correlation between arginine and citrulline levels in these patients. We found no correlation between the level of heteroplasmy and the plasma levels of either arginine or citrulline. We discuss the depressed citrulline levels in MELAS patients, who have an unusual and paradoxical pattern of vascular respiratory chain expression, in the context of NO homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Human SCO1 and SCO2 are copper-binding proteins involved in the assembly of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX). We have determined the crystal structure of the conserved, intermembrane space core portion of apo-hSCO1 to 2.8 A. It is similar to redox active proteins, including thioredoxins (Trx) and peroxiredoxins (Prx), with putative copper-binding ligands located at the same positions as the conserved catalytic residues in Trx and Prx. SCO1 does not have disulfide isomerization or peroxidase activity, but both hSCO1 and a sco1 null in yeast show extreme sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. Of the six missense mutations in SCO1 and SCO2 associated with fatal mitochondrial disorders, one lies in a highly conserved exposed surface away from the copper-binding region, suggesting that this region is involved in protein-protein interactions. These data suggests that SCO functions not as a COX copper chaperone, but rather as a mitochondrial redox signaling molecule.",

Cytochrome-c oxidase is composed of 13 subunits, of which 3 are encoded by mitochondrial DNA and 10 by nuclear DNA. Mutations have been identified in each of the 3 mitochondrial DNA genes but in none of the nuclear DNA genes. However, COX deficiency has been attributed to mutations in several nuclear DNA-encoded ancillary proteins needed for COX assembly and function. Despite this progress, the molecular basis of COX deficiency remains elusive in many patients, justifying the identification and screening of additional COX assembly genes, such as COX16, COX19, and PET191.",

        "Abstract": "Impairment of mitochondrial energy metabolism has been associated with a wide range of human disorders. Large-scale partial deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cause sporadic Kearns-Sayre syndrome, a fatal multisystem disorder, in which the majority of mtDNAs in affected tissues have deletions (Delta-mtDNAs). Since most mtDNA-related diseases, including Kearns-Sayre syndrome, are recessive, only a few wild-type mtDNAs can compensate for the deleterious effects of many Delta-mtDNAs. We have developed a pharmacological approach to reduce the proportion of Delta-mtDNAs in vitro, in which we grow cells in medium containing ketone bodies, replacing glucose as the carbon source. Cells containing 100% Delta-mtDNA died after 5 days of treatment, whereas those containing 100% wild-type mtDNA survived. Furthermore, in a cloned heteroplasmic cell line, the proportion of wild-type mtDNA increased from 13% initially to approximately 22% after 5 days in ketogenic medium and was accompanied by a dramatic improvement in mitochondrial protein synthesis. We also present evidence that treatment with ketone bodies caused \"heteroplasmic shifting\" not only among cells (ie, intercellular selection) but also within cells (ie, intracellular selection). The demonstration that ketone bodies can distinguish between normal and respiratorily compromised cells points to the potential use of a ketogenic diet to treat patients with heteroplasmic mtDNA disorders.",

        "Abstract": "We analysed key biochemical features that reflect the balance between glycolysis and glucose oxidation in cybrids (cytoplasmic hybrids) harbouring a representative sample of mitochondrial DNA point mutations and deletions. The cybrids analysed had the same 143B cell nuclear background and were isogenic for the mitochondrial background. The 143B cell line and its rho(0) counterpart were used as controls. All cells analysed were in a dynamic state, and cell number, time of plating, culture medium, extracellular volume and time of harvest and assay were strictly controlled. Intra- and extra-cellular lactate and pyruvate levels were measured in homoplasmic wild-type and mutant cells, and correlated with rates of ATP synthesis and O2 consumption. In all mutant cell lines, except those with the T8993C mutation in the ATPase 6 gene, glycolysis was increased even under conditions of low glucose, as demonstrated by increased levels of extracellular lactate and pyruvate. Extracellular lactate levels were strictly and inversely correlated with rates of ATP synthesis and O2 consumption. These results show increased glycolysis and defective oxidative phosphorylation, irrespective of the type or site of the point mutation or deletion in the mitochondrial genome. The different biochemical consequences of the T8993C mutation suggest a uniquely different pathogenic mechanism for this mutation. However, the distinct clinical features associated with some of these mutations still remain to be elucidated.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions are a common cause of human mitochondrial disease and also occur as part of normal aging. However, it is unknown how the deletions actually occur. To gain further insight, we studied the sequences that flank 263 different human mtDNA deletions. The distribution of deletion breakpoints did not correspond to the basic parameters of wild-type mtDNA that are thought to predispose to deletion formation. But there was a striking correspondence to the position of two 13-bp direct repeats beginning at nucleotides 8470 and 13 447. The vast majority of different mtDNA deletions appear to be related to these two repeats, suggesting a common mechanism related to mtDNA replication.",

        "Abstract": "Oncocytomas are typically benign epithelial tumors whose predominant feature is a massive accumulation of mitochondria in the cytoplasm. With the goal of identifying genes controlling mitochondrial proliferation, we studied three oncocytomas belonging to the cytogenetic subgroup with 11q13 rearrangements. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones showed that the 11q13 breakpoints in all three tumors were near the CCND1 (previously BCL1) gene and did not disrupt any other known gene. The rearrangement in one tumor consisted of a segmental duplication that included 11q13, suggesting that known mitochondrially targeted genes immediately distal to CCND1 may be involved in oncocytic proliferation.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cause impairment of ATP synthesis. It was hypothesized that high-energy compounds, such as ATP, are compartmentalized within cells and that different cell functions are sustained by different pools of ATP, some deriving from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and others from glycolysis. Therefore, an OXPHOS dysfunction may affect different cell compartments to different extents. To address this issue, we have used recombinant forms of the ATP reporter luciferase localized in different cell compartments- the cytosol, the subplasma membrane region, the mitochondrial matrix, and the nucleus- of cells containing either wild-type or mutant mtDNA. We found that with glycolytic substrates, both wild-type and mutant cells were able to maintain adequate ATP supplies in all compartments. Conversely, with the OXPHOS substrate pyruvate ATP levels collapsed in all cell compartments of mutant cells. In wild-type cells normal levels of ATP were maintained with pyruvate in the cytosol and in the subplasma membrane region, but, surprisingly, they were reduced in the mitochondria and, to a greater extent, in the nucleus. The severe decrease in nuclear ATP content under \"OXPHOS-only\" conditions implies that depletion of nuclear ATP plays an important, and hitherto unappreciated, role in patients with mitochondrial dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "Unlike most organisms, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a green alga, does not encode subunit 6 of F(0)F(1)-ATP synthase. We hypothesized that C. reinhardtii ATPase 6 is nucleus encoded and identified cDNAs and a single-copy nuclear gene specifying this subunit (CrATP6, with eight exons, four of which encode a mitochondrial targeting signal). Although the algal and human ATP6 genes are in different subcellular compartments and the encoded polypeptides are highly diverged, their secondary structures are remarkably similar. When CrATP6 was expressed in human cells, a significant amount of the precursor polypeptide was targeted to mitochondria, the mitochondrial targeting signal was cleaved within the organelle, and the mature polypeptide was assembled into human ATP synthase. In spite of the evolutionary distance between algae and mammals, C. reinhardtii ATPase 6 functioned in human cells, because deficiencies in both cell viability and ATP synthesis in transmitochondrial cell lines harboring a pathogenic mutation in the human mtDNA-encoded ATP6 gene were overcome by expression of CrATP6. The ability to express a nucleus-encoded version of a mammalian mtDNA-encoded protein may provide a way to import other highly hydrophobic proteins into mitochondria and could serve as the basis for a gene therapy approach to treat human mitochondrial diseases.",

        "Abstract": "The involvement of mitochondria and of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the aging process has generated much interest and even more controversy. The mitochondrial theory of aging considers a vicious circle consisting of: (1) accumulation of somatic mtDNA mutations; (2) impairment of respiratory chain function; (3) increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria; and (4) further damage to mtDNA. We review the evidence for and against the belief that these steps occur in aging muscle and brain, considering separately morphological, biochemical, and molecular data. The relationship between mitochondrial aging and late-onset neurodegenerative diseases is briefly reviewed. We conclude that mitochondrial dysfunction does play a crucial role in the aging process of both muscle and brain, but it remains unclear whether mitochondria are the culprits or mere accomplices.",

        "Abstract": "A G to A transition at nucleotide 11778 in the ND4 subunit gene of complex I was the first point mutation in the mitochondrial genome linked to a human disease. It causes Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy, a disorder with oxidative phosphorylation deficiency. To overcome this defect, we made a synthetic ND4 subunit compatible with the \"universal\" genetic code and imported it into mitochondria by adding a mitochondrial targeting sequence. For detection we added a FLAG tag. This gene was inserted in an adeno-associated viral vector. The ND4FLAG protein was imported into the mitochondria of cybrids harboring the G11778A mutation, where it increased their survival rate threefold, under restrictive conditions that forced the cells to rely predominantly on oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP. Since assays of complex I activity were normal in G11778A cybrids we focused on changes in ATP synthesis using complex I substrates. The G11778A cybrids showed a 60% reduction in the rate of ATP synthesis. Relative to mock-transfected G11778A cybrids, complemented G11778A cybrids showed a threefold increase in ATP synthesis, to a level indistinguishable from that in cybrids containing normal mitochondrial DNA. Restoration of respiration by allotopic expression opens the door for gene therapy of Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy.",

        "Abstract": "Single deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are associated with three major clinical conditions: Kearns-Sayre syndrome, a multisystem disorder; Pearson syndrome (PS), a disorder of the hematopoietic system; and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), primarily affecting the ocular muscles. Typically, single mtDNA deletions are sporadic events, since the mothers, siblings, and offspring of affected individuals are unaffected. We studied a woman who presented with PEO, ptosis, and weakness of pharyngeal, facial, neck, and limb muscles. She had two unaffected children, but another of her children, an infant son, had sideroblastic anemia, was diagnosed with PS, and died at age 1 year. Morphological analysis of a muscle biopsy sample from the mother showed cytochrome c oxidase-negative ragged-red fibers-a typical pattern in patients with mtDNA deletions. Southern blot analysis using multiple restriction endonucleases and probed with multiple mtDNA fragments showed that both the mother and her infant son harbored an identical 5,355-bp single deletion in mtDNA, without flanking direct repeats. The deletion was the only abnormal species of mtDNA identified in both patients, and there was no evidence for duplications. We conclude that, although the vast majority of single large-scale deletions in mtDNA are sporadic, in rare cases, single deletions can be transmitted through the germline.",

        "Abstract": "The pathogenic mechanisms of the A1555G mitochondrial DNA mutation in the 12S rRNA gene, associated with maternally inherited sensorineural deafness, are largely unknown. Previous studies have suggested an involvement of nuclear factor(s). To address this issue cybrids were generated by fusing osteosarcoma cells devoid of mtDNA with enucleated fibroblasts from two genetically unrelated patients. Furthermore, to determine the contribution, if any, of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, separately or in combination, in the expression of the disease phenotype, transmitochondrial fibroblasts were constructed using control and patient's fibroblasts as nuclear donors and homoplasmic mutant or wild-type cybrids as mitochondrial donors. Detailed analysis of mutant and wild-type cybrids from both patients and transmitochondrial fibroblast clones did not reveal any respiratory chain dysfunction suggesting that, if nuclear factors do indeed act as modifier agents, they may be tissue-specific. However, in the presence of high concentrations of neomycin or paromomycin, but not of streptomycin, mutant cells exhibit a decrease in the growth rate, when compared to wild-type cells. The decrease did not correlate with the rate of synthesis or stability of mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunits or respiratory chain activity. Further studies are required to determine the underlying biochemical defect.",

        "Abstract": "Human SCO2 is a nuclear-encoded Cu-binding protein, presumed to be responsible for the insertion of Cu into the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) holoenzyme. Mutations in SCO2 are associated with cardioencephalomyopathy and COX deficiency. Studies in yeast and bacteria have shown that Cu supplementation can restore COX activity in cells harbouring mutations in genes involving Cu transport. Therefore we investigated whether Cu supplementation could restore COX activity in cultured cells from patients with SCO2 mutations. Our data demonstrate that the COX deficiency observed in fibroblasts, myoblasts and myotubes from patients with SCO2 mutations can be restored to almost normal levels by the addition of CuCl(2) to the growth medium.",

To overcome the biochemical defect, we expressed wildtype ATPase 6 protein allotopically from nucleus-transfected constructs encoding an amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal appended to a recoded ATPase 6 gene (made compatible with the universal genetic code) that also contained a carboxy-terminal FLAG epitope tag. After transfection of human cells, the precursor polypeptide was expressed, imported into and processed within mitochondria, and incorporated into complex V. Allotopic expression of stably transfected constructs in cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrids) homoplasmic with respect to the 8993T-->G mutation showed a significantly improved recovery after growth in selective medium as well as a significant increase in ATP synthesis. This is the first successful demonstration of allotopic expression of an mtDNA-encoded polypeptide in mammalian cells and could form the basis of a genetic approach to treat a number of human mitochondrial disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective motor neuron death. In order to address the question of a putative role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of ALS, we studied the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities in spinal cords of ALS patients and in control subjects without neuropathologic abnormalities. Using a \"double PCR and digestion\" technique to estimate the levels of randomly distributed point mutations in two small regions of the mtDNA, we found significantly higher levels of mutant mtDNA in the spinal cord of ALS patients compared to controls. No large-scale rearrangements were found, but the amount of mtDNA, measured by Southern blot, was significantly lower in the ALS samples. This reduction correlated well with a decrease of citrate synthase (CS) activity, a mitochondrial marker, as were the activities of respiratory chain complexes I + III, II + III, and IV, suggesting a loss of mitochondria in ALS spinal cords.",
