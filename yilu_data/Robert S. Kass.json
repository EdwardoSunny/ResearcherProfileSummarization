        "Abstract": "Targeted recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligases to degrade traditionally undruggable proteins is a disruptive paradigm for developing new therapeutics. Two salient limitations are that <2% of the ~600 E3 ligases in the human genome have been exploited to produce proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), and the efficacy of the approach has not been demonstrated for a vital class of complex multi-subunit membrane proteins- ion channels. NEDD4-1 and NEDD4-2 are physiological regulators of myriad ion channels, and belong to the 28-member HECT (homologous to E6AP C-terminus) family of E3 ligases with widespread roles in cell/developmental biology and diverse diseases including various cancers, immunological and neurological disorders, and chronic pain. The potential efficacy of HECT E3 ligases for targeted protein degradation is unexplored, constrained by a lack of appropriate binders, and uncertain due to their complex regulation by layered intra-molecular and posttranslational mechanisms. Here, we identified a nanobody that binds with high affinity and specificity to a unique site on the N-lobe of the NEDD4-2 HECT domain at a location physically separate from sites critical for catalysis- the E2 binding site, the catalytic cysteine, and the ubiquitin exosite- as revealed by a 3.1 \u00c5 cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction. Recruiting endogenous NEDD4-2 to diverse ion channel proteins (KCNQ1, ENaC, and Ca",

Deleterious remodeling in the pulmonary arterial system leads to irreversible arterial constriction and elevated pulmonary arterial pressures, right heart failure, and eventually death. The difficulty in treating PAH stems in part from the complex nature of disease pathogenesis, with several signaling compounds known to be involved (e.g., endothelin-1, prostacyclins) which are indeed targets of PAH therapy. Over the last decade, potassium channelopathies were established as novel causes of PAH. More specifically, loss-of-function mutations in the ",

        "Abstract": "In the United States, approximately one million individuals are hospitalized every year for arrhythmias, making arrhythmias one of the top causes of healthcare expenditures. Mexiletine is currently used as an antiarrhythmic drug but has limitations. The purpose of this work was to use normal and Long QT syndrome Type 3 (LQTS3) patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes to identify an analog of mexiletine with superior drug-like properties. Compared to racemic mexiletine, medicinal chemistry optimization of substituted racemic pyridyl phenyl mexiletine analogs resulted in a more potent sodium channel inhibitor with greater selectivity for the sodium over the potassium channel and for late over peak sodium current.",

        "Abstract": "Modeling cardiac disorders with human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes is a new paradigm for preclinical testing of candidate therapeutics. However, disease-relevant physiological assays can be complex, and the use of hiPSC-cardiomyocyte models of congenital disease phenotypes for guiding large-scale screening and medicinal chemistry have not been shown. We report chemical refinement of the antiarrhythmic drug mexiletine via high-throughput screening of hiPSC-CMs derived from patients with the cardiac rhythm disorder long QT syndrome 3 (LQT3) carrying SCN5A sodium channel variants. Using iterative cycles of medicinal chemistry synthesis and testing, we identified drug analogs with increased potency and selectivity for inhibiting late sodium current across a panel of 7 LQT3 sodium channel variants and suppressing arrhythmic activity across multiple genetic and pharmacological hiPSC-CM models of LQT3 with diverse backgrounds. These mexiletine analogs can be exploited as mechanistic probes and for clinical development.",

Recently, the first potassium channelopathy in PAH, because of mutations in KCNK3, was identified as a genetic cause and pharmacological target.",

These include IKs, IKr and the atrial specific IKur channels. In this article, we will review their molecular identities and biophysical properties. Mutations in the genes encoding delayed rectifiers lead to loss- or gain-of-function phenotypes, disrupt normal cardiac repolarization and result in various cardiac rhythm disorders, including congenital Long QT Syndrome, Short QT Syndrome and familial atrial fibrillation. We will also discuss the prospect of using delayed rectifier channels as therapeutic targets to manage cardiac arrhythmia.",

Over 40 drugs with both cardiac and non-cardiac indications are associated with increased risk of TdP, but drug-drug interactions contributing to LQTS (QT-DDIs) remain poorly characterized. Traditional methods for mining observational healthcare data are poorly equipped to detect QT-DDI signals due to low reporting numbers and lack of direct evidence for LQTS.",

        "Abstract": "The therapeutic success of human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes critically depends on their ability to respond to and integrate with the surrounding electromechanical environment. Currently, the immaturity of human cardiomyocytes derived from stem cells limits their utility for regenerative medicine and biological research. We hypothesize that biomimetic electrical signals regulate the intrinsic beating properties of cardiomyocytes. Here we show that electrical conditioning of human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in three-dimensional culture promotes cardiomyocyte maturation, alters their automaticity and enhances connexin expression. Cardiomyocytes adapt their autonomous beating rate to the frequency at which they were stimulated, an effect mediated by the emergence of a rapidly depolarizing cell population, and the expression of hERG. This rate-adaptive behaviour is long lasting and transferable to the surrounding cardiomyocytes. Thus, electrical conditioning may be used to promote cardiomyocyte maturation and establish their automaticity, with implications for cell-based reduction of arrhythmia during heart regeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Purkinje cells (PC) within the specialized cardiac conduction system have unique electrophysiological properties that we hypothesize may produce the primary sources of arrhythmia in heritable LQTS. LQTS type 3 (LQT3) transgenic mice harboring the \u0394KPQ(+/-) mutation were crossed with Contactin2-EGFP BAC transgenic mice, which express a fluorescent reporter gene within the Purkinje fiber network. Isolated ventricular myocytes (VMs) (EGFP(-)) and PCs (EGFP(+)) from wild type and \u0394KPQ mutant hearts were compared using the whole-cell patch clamp technique and microfluorimetry of calcium transients. Increased late sodium current was seen in \u0394KPQ-PCs and \u0394KPQ-VMs, with larger density in \u0394KPQ-PCs. Marked prolongation of action potential duration of \u0394KPQ-PCs was seen compared to \u0394KPQ-VMs. \u0394KPQ-PCs, but not \u0394KPQ-VMs, exhibited frequent early afterdepolarizations, which corresponded to repetitive oscillations of intracellular calcium. Abnormalities in cell repolarization were reversed with exposure to mexiletine. We present the first direct experimental evidence that PCs are uniquely sensitive to LQT3 mutations, displaying electrophysiological behavior that is highly pro-arrhythmic.",

        "Abstract": "In February 2014, a group of scientists convened as part of the University of California Davis Cardiovascular Symposium to bring together experimental and mathematical modelling perspectives and discuss points of consensus and controversy on the topic of sodium in the heart. This paper summarizes the topics of presentation and discussion from the symposium, with a focus on the role of aberrant sodium channels and abnormal sodium homeostasis in cardiac arrhythmias and pharmacotherapy from the subcellular scale to the whole heart. Two following papers focus on Na(+) channel structure, function and regulation, and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase. The UC Davis Cardiovascular Symposium is a biannual event that aims to bring together leading experts in subfields of cardiovascular biomedicine to focus on topics of importance to the field. The focus on Na(+) in the 2014 symposium stemmed from the multitude of recent studies that point to the importance of maintaining Na(+) homeostasis in the heart, as disruption of homeostatic processes are increasingly identified in cardiac disease states. Understanding how disruption in cardiac Na(+)-based processes leads to derangement in multiple cardiac components at the level of the cell and to then connect these perturbations to emergent behaviour in the heart to cause disease is a critical area of research. The ubiquity of disruption of Na(+) channels and Na(+) homeostasis in cardiac disorders of excitability and mechanics emphasizes the importance of a fundamental understanding of the associated mechanisms and disease processes to ultimately reveal new targets for human therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital long QT syndrome is a heritable family of arrhythmias caused by mutations in 13 genes encoding ion channel complex proteins. Mounting evidence has implicated the Purkinje fiber network in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that long QT mutations can demonstrate different phenotypes depending on the tissue type of expression. Using computational models of the human ventricular myocyte and the Purkinje fiber cell, the biophysical alteration in channel function in LQT1, LQT2, LQT3, and LQT7 are modeled. We identified that the plateau potential was important in LQT1 and LQT2, in which mutation led to minimal action potential prolongation in Purkinje fiber cells. The phenotype of LQT3 mutation was dependent on the biophysical alteration induced as well as tissue type. The canonical \u0394KPQ mutation causes severe action potential prolongation in both tissue types. For LQT3 mutation F1473C, characterized by shifted channel availability, a more severe phenotype was seen in Purkinje fiber cells with action potential prolongation and early afterdepolarizations. The LQT3 mutation S1904L demonstrated striking effects on action potential duration restitution and more severe action potential prolongation in Purkinje fiber cells at higher heart rates. Voltage clamp simulations highlight the mechanism of effect of these mutations in different tissue types, and impact of drug therapy is explored. We conclude that arrhythmia formation in long QT syndrome may depend not only on the basis of mutation and biophysical alteration, but also upon tissue of expression. The Purkinje fiber network may represent an important therapeutic target in the management of patients with heritable channelopathies.",

        "Title": "KCNE1 divides the voltage sensor movement in KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels into two steps.",
        "Abstract": "The functional properties of KCNQ1 channels are highly dependent on associated KCNE-\u03b2 subunits. Mutations in KCNQ1 or KCNE subunits can cause congenital channelopathies, such as deafness, cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsy. The mechanism by which KCNE1-\u03b2 subunits slow the kinetics of KCNQ1 channels is a matter of current controversy. Here we show that KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel activation occurs in two steps: first, mutually independent voltage sensor movements in the four KCNQ1 subunits generate the main gating charge movement and underlie the initial delay in the activation time course of KCNQ1/KCNE1 currents. Second, a slower and concerted conformational change of all four voltage sensors and the gate, which opens the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel. Our data show that KCNE1 divides the voltage sensor movement into two steps with widely different voltage dependences and kinetics. The two voltage sensor steps in KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels can be pharmacologically isolated and further separated by a disease-causing mutation.",

Thus, ranolazine is contraindicated for patients with preexisting long-QT and those with repolarization abnormalities. However, with its preferential targeting of late INa (INaL), patients with disease resulting from increased INaL from inherited defects (eg, long-QT syndrome type 3 or disease-induced electric remodeling (eg, ischemic heart failure) might be exactly the ones to benefit most from the presumed antiarrhythmic properties of ranolazine.",

        "Title": "Dynamic subunit stoichiometry confers a progressive continuum of pharmacological sensitivity by KCNQ potassium channels.",
        "Abstract": "Voltage-gated KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) potassium channels are expressed abundantly in heart but they are also found in multiple other tissues. Differential coassembly with single transmembrane KCNE beta subunits in different cell types gives rise to a variety of biophysical properties, hence endowing distinct physiological roles for KCNQ1-KCNEx complexes. Mutations in either KCNQ1 or KCNE1 genes result in diseases in brain, heart, and the respiratory system. In addition to complexities arising from existence of five KCNE subunits, KCNE1 to KCNE5, recent studies in heterologous systems suggest unorthodox stoichiometric dynamics in subunit assembly is dependent on KCNE expression levels. The resultant KCNQ1-KCNE channel complexes may have a range of zero to two or even up to four KCNE subunits coassembling per KCNQ1 tetramer. These findings underscore the need to assess the selectivity of small-molecule KCNQ1 modulators on these different assemblies. Here we report a unique small-molecule gating modulator, ML277, that potentiates both homomultimeric KCNQ1 channels and unsaturated heteromultimeric (KCNQ1)4(KCNE1)n (n < 4) channels. Progressive increase of KCNE1 or KCNE3 expression reduces efficacy of ML277 and eventually abolishes ML277-mediated augmentation. In cardiomyocytes, the slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium current, or IKs, is believed to be a heteromultimeric combination of KCNQ1 and KCNE1, but it is not entirely clear whether IKs is mediated by KCNE-saturated KCNQ1 channels or by channels with intermediate stoichiometries. We found ML277 effectively augments IKs current of cultured human cardiomyocytes and shortens action potential duration. These data indicate that unsaturated heteromultimeric (KCNQ1)4(KCNE1)n channels are present as components of IKs and are pharmacologically distinct from KCNE-saturated KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the basis for differential responses to drug therapies remains a challenge despite advances in genetics and genomics. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the pharmacology of disease processes in therapeutically and genetically relevant primary cell types in vitro and to interweave clinical and basic molecular data. We report here the derivation of iPSCs from a long QT syndrome patient with complex genetics. The proband was found to have a de novo SCN5A LQT-3 mutation (F1473C) and a polymorphism (K897T) in KCNH2, the gene for LQT-2. Analysis of the biophysics and molecular pharmacology of ion channels expressed in cardiomyocytes (CMs) differentiated from these iPSCs (iPSC-CMs) demonstrates a primary LQT-3 (Na(+) channel) defect responsible for the arrhythmias not influenced by the KCNH2 polymorphism. The F1473C mutation occurs in the channel inactivation gate and enhances late Na(+) channel current (I(NaL)) that is carried by channels that fail to inactivate completely and conduct increased inward current during prolonged depolarization, resulting in delayed repolarization, a prolonged QT interval, and increased risk of fatal arrhythmia. We find a very pronounced rate dependence of I(NaL) such that increasing the pacing rate markedly reduces I(NaL) and, in addition, increases its inhibition by the Na(+) channel blocker mexiletine. These rate-dependent properties and drug interactions, unique to the proband's iPSC-CMs, correlate with improved management of arrhythmias in the patient and provide support for this approach in developing patient-specific clinical regimens.",

        "Title": "The A-kinase anchoring protein Yotiao facilitates complex formation between adenylyl cyclase type 9 and the IKs potassium channel in heart.",
        "Abstract": "The scaffolding protein Yotiao is a member of a large family of protein A-kinase anchoring proteins with important roles in the organization of spatial and temporal signaling. In heart, Yotiao directly associates with the slow outward potassium ion current (I(Ks)) and recruits both PKA and PP1 to regulate I(Ks) phosphorylation and gating. Human mutations that disrupt I(Ks)-Yotiao interaction result in reduced PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the I(Ks) subunit KCNQ1 and inhibition of sympathetic stimulation of I(Ks), which can give rise to long-QT syndrome. We have previously identified a subset of adenylyl cyclase (AC) isoforms that interact with Yotiao, including AC1-3 and AC9, but surprisingly, this group did not include the major cardiac isoforms AC5 and AC6. We now show that either AC2 or AC9 can associate with KCNQ1 in a complex mediated by Yotiao. In transgenic mouse heart expressing KCNQ1-KCNE1, AC activity was specifically associated with the I(Ks)-Yotiao complex and could be disrupted by addition of the AC9 N terminus. A survey of all AC isoforms by RT-PCR indicated expression of AC4-6 and AC9 in adult mouse cardiac myocytes. Of these, the only Yotiao-interacting isoform was AC9. Furthermore, the endogenous I(Ks)-Yotiao complex from guinea pig also contained AC9. Finally, AC9 association with the KCNQ1-Yotiao complex sensitized PKA phosphorylation of KCNQ1 to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. Thus, in heart, Yotiao brings together PKA, PP1, PDE4D3, AC9, and the I(Ks) channel to achieve localized temporal regulation of \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation.",

        "Title": "Allosteric gating mechanism underlies the flexible gating of KCNQ1 potassium channels.",
        "Abstract": "KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) is a unique member of the superfamily of voltage-gated K(+) channels in that it displays a remarkable range of gating behaviors tuned by coassembly with different \u03b2 subunits of the KCNE family of proteins. To better understand the basis for the biophysical diversity of KCNQ1 channels, we here investigate the basis of KCNQ1 gating in the absence of \u03b2 subunits using voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF). In our previous study, we found the kinetics and voltage dependence of voltage-sensor movements are very similar to those of the channel gate, as if multiple voltage-sensor movements are not required to precede gate opening. Here, we have tested two different hypotheses to explain KCNQ1 gating: (i) KCNQ1 voltage sensors undergo a single concerted movement that leads to channel opening, or (ii) individual voltage-sensor movements lead to channel opening before all voltage sensors have moved. Here, we find that KCNQ1 voltage sensors move relatively independently, but that the channel can conduct before all voltage sensors have activated. We explore a KCNQ1 point mutation that causes some channels to transition to the open state even in the absence of voltage-sensor movement. To interpret these results, we adopt an allosteric gating scheme wherein KCNQ1 is able to transition to the open state after zero to four voltage-sensor movements. This model allows for widely varying gating behavior, depending on the relative strength of the opening transition, and suggests how KCNQ1 could be controlled by coassembly with different KCNE family members.",

        "Abstract": "The cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel (Na(V)1.5) underlies impulse conduction in the heart, and its depolarization-induced inactivation is essential in control of the duration of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram. Perturbation of Na(V)1.5 inactivation by drugs or inherited mutation can underlie and trigger cardiac arrhythmias. The carboxy terminus has an important role in channel inactivation, but complete structural information on its predicted structural domain is unknown. Here we measure interactions between the functionally critical distal carboxy terminus \u03b1-helix (H6) and the proximal structured EF-hand motif using transition-metal ion fluorescence resonance energy transfer. We measure distances at three loci along H6 relative to an intrinsic tryptophan, demonstrating the proximal-distal interaction in a contiguous carboxy terminus polypeptide. Using these data together with the existing Na(V)1.5 carboxy terminus nuclear magnetic resonance structure, we construct a model of the predicted structured region of the carboxy terminus. An arrhythmia-associated H6 mutant that impairs inactivation decreases fluorescence resonance energy transfer, indicating destabilization of the distal-proximal intramolecular interaction. These data provide a structural correlation to the pathological phenotype of the mutant channel.",

Inherited mutations in either I(Ks) channel subunit are associated with cardiac arrhythmia syndromes. Two mutations (S140G and V141M) that cause familial atrial fibrillation (AF) are located on adjacent residues in the first membrane-spanning domain of KCNQ1, S1. These mutations impair the deactivation process, causing channels to appear constitutively open. Previous studies suggest that both mutant phenotypes require the presence of KCNE1. Here we found that despite the proximity of these two mutations in the primary protein structure, they display different functional dependence in the presence of KCNE1. In the absence of KCNE1, the S140G mutation, but not V141M, confers a pronounced slowing of channel deactivation and a hyperpolarizing shift in voltage-dependent activation. When coexpressed with KCNE1, both mutants deactivate significantly slower than wild-type KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels. The differential dependence on KCNE1 can be correlated with the physical proximity between these positions and KCNE1 as shown by disulfide cross-linking studies: V141C forms disulfide bonds with cysteine-substituted KCNE1 residues, whereas S140C does not. These results further our understanding of the structural relationship between KCNE1 and KCNQ1 subunits in the I(Ks) channel, and provide mechanisms for understanding the effects on channel deactivation underlying these two atrial fibrillation mutations.",

        "Abstract": "Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are an important cellular model for studying ion channel function in the context of a human cardiac cell and will provide a wealth of information about both heritable arrhythmias and acquired electrophysiological disorders. However, detailed electrophysiological characterization of the important cardiac ion channels has been so far overlooked. Because mutations in the gene for the I(Ks) \u03b1 subunit, KCNQ1, constitute the majority of long QT syndrome (LQT-1) cases, we have carried out a detailed biophysical analysis of this channel expressed in hESCs to establish baseline I(Ks) channel biophysical properties in cardiac myocytes derived from hESCs (hESC-CMs). I(Ks) channels are heteromultimeric proteins consisting of four identical \u03b1-subunits (KCNQ1) assembled with auxiliary \u03b2-subunits (KCNE1). We found that the half-maximal I(Ks) activation voltage in hESC-CMs and in myocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stems cells (hiPSC-CMs) falls between that of KCNQ1 channels expressed alone and with full complement of KCNE1, the major KCNE subunit expressed in hESC-CMs as shown by qPCR analysis. Overexpression of KCNE1 by transfection of hESC-CMs markedly shifted and slowed native I(Ks) activation implying assembly of additional KCNE1 subunits with endogenous channels. Our results in hESC-CMs, which indicate an I(Ks) subunit stoichiometry that can be altered by variable KCNE1 expression, suggest the possibility for variable I(Ks) function in the developing heart, in different tissues in the heart, and in disease. This establishes a new baseline for I(Ks) channel properties in myocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells and will guide future studies in patient-specific hiPSCs.",

        "Abstract": "A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) create compartmentalized environment inside the cell to bring various signaling molecules to their targets. In the heart, a slowly activating potassium channel (IKs) important for cardiac repolarization is tightly regulated by the sympathetic nervous system in an AKAP-dependent manner. IKs channel forms a macromolecular complex with AKAP9 and other enzymes, such as protein kinase A, phosphatase, adenylyl cyclase, and phosphodiesterase, all of which are responsible to control the phosphorylation state of the channel. Such a complex thus ensures the IKs channel to be regulated properly to maintain the normal cardiac rhythm. Disruptions of various elements of the complex have been found to cause severe pathological consequences, including the long QT syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "A long-sought, and thus far elusive, goal has been to develop drugs to manage diseases of excitability. One such disease that affects millions each year is cardiac arrhythmia, which occurs when electrical impulses in the heart become disordered, sometimes causing sudden death. Pharmacological management of cardiac arrhythmia has failed because it is not possible to predict how drugs that target cardiac ion channels, and have intrinsically complex dynamic interactions with ion channels, will alter the emergent electrical behavior generated in the heart. Here, we applied a computational model, which was informed and validated by experimental data, that defined key measurable parameters necessary to simulate the interaction kinetics of the anti-arrhythmic drugs flecainide and lidocaine with cardiac sodium channels. We then used the model to predict the effects of these drugs on normal human ventricular cellular and tissue electrical activity in the setting of a common arrhythmia trigger, spontaneous ventricular ectopy. The model forecasts the clinically relevant concentrations at which flecainide and lidocaine exacerbate, rather than ameliorate, arrhythmia. Experiments in rabbit hearts and simulations in human ventricles based on magnetic resonance images validated the model predictions. This computational framework initiates the first steps toward development of a virtual drug-screening system that models drug-channel interactions and predicts the effects of drugs on emergent electrical activity in the heart.",

        "Abstract": "Post-translational modifications of the KCNQ1\u2013KCNE1 (Kv7) K+ channel complex are vital for regulation of the cardiac IKs current and action potential duration. Here, we show the KCNE1 regulatory subunit is O-glycosylated with mucin-type glycans in vivo. As O-linked glycosylation sites are not recognizable by sequence gazing, we designed a novel set of glycosylation mutants and KCNE chimeras and analysed their glycan content using deglycosylation enzymes. Our results show that KCNE1 is exclusively O-glycosylated at Thr-7, which is also required for N-glycosylation at Asn-5. For wild type KCNE1, the overlapping N- and O-glycosylation sites are innocuous for subunit biogenesis; however, mutation of Thr-7 to a non-hydroxylated residue yielded mostly unglycosylated protein and a small fraction of mono-N-glycosylated protein. The compounded hypoglycosylation was equally deleterious for KCNQ1\u2013KCNE1 cell surface expression, demonstrating that KCNE1 O-glycosylation is a post-translational modification that is integral for the proper biogenesis and anterograde trafficking of the cardiac IKs complex. The enzymatic assays and panel of glycosylation mutants used here will be valuable for identifying the different KCNE1 glycoforms in native cells and determining the roles N- and O-glycosylation play in KCNQ1\u2013KCNE1 function and localization in cardiomyocytes,",

        "Abstract": "The delayed rectifier I(Ks) potassium channel, formed by coassembly of \u03b1- (KCNQ1) and \u03b2- (KCNE1) subunits, is essential for cardiac function. Although KCNE1 is necessary to reproduce the functional properties of the native I(Ks) channel, the mechanism(s) through which KCNE1 modulates KCNQ1 is unknown. Here we report measurements of voltage sensor movements in KCNQ1 and KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels using voltage clamp fluorometry. KCNQ1 channels exhibit indistinguishable voltage dependence of fluorescence and current signals, suggesting a one-to-one relationship between voltage sensor movement and channel opening. KCNE1 coexpression dramatically separates the voltage dependence of KCNQ1/KCNE1 current and fluorescence, suggesting an imposed requirement for movements of multiple voltage sensors before KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel opening. This work provides insight into the mechanism by which KCNE1 modulates the I(Ks) channel and presents a mechanism for distinct \u03b2-subunit regulation of ion channel proteins.",

Small alterations in gating properties can lead to severe changes in cellular excitability, as evidenced by the plethora of heritable conditions attributed to mutations in VGSCs highlighting the need to better understand VGSC regulation. In this issue of the JCI, Hund et al. identify the ability of a key structural protein, \u03b2(IV)-spectrin, to bind and recruit Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II to the channel at a cellular location key to successful action potential initiation and propagation, where it can mediate function and excitability.",

Over the past decade, the discovery of macromolecular complexes, which include the ion channels and pumps and the kinases that control their level of phosphorylation, has led to an increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the cardiac adrenergic response. The increased understanding has led to the discovery of a new long QT gene encoding an accessory protein in one of these macromolecular complexes.

        "Abstract": "The congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a heritable arrhythmia in which mutations in genes coding for ion channels or ion channel associated proteins delay ventricular repolarization and place mutation carriers at risk for serious or fatal arrhythmias. Triggers and therapeutic management of LQTS arrhythmias have been shown to differ in a manner that depends strikingly on the gene that is mutated. Additionally, beta-blockers, effective in the management of LQT-1, have been thought to be potentially proarrhythmic in the treatment of LQT-3 because of concomitant slowing of heart rate that accompanies decreased adrenergic activity. Here we report that the beta-blocker propranolol interacts with wild type (WT) and LQT-3 mutant Na(+) channels in a manner that resembles the actions of local anesthetic drugs. We demonstrate that propranolol blocks Na(+) channels in a use-dependent manner; that propranolol efficacy is dependent on the inactivated state of the channel; that propranolol blocks late non-inactivating current more effectively than peak sodium current; and that mutation of the local anesthetic binding site greatly reduces the efficacy of propranolol block of peak and late Na(+) channel current. Furthermore our results indicate that this activity, like that of local anesthetic drugs, differs both with drug structure and the biophysical changes in Na(+) channel function caused by specific LQT-3 mutations.",

        "Abstract": "The cardiac I(Ks) potassium channel is a macromolecular complex consisting of alpha-(KCNQ1) and beta-subunits (KCNE1) and the A kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP) Yotiao (AKAP-9), which recruits protein kinase A) and protein phosphatase 1 to the channel. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that specific cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoforms of the PDE4D family that are expressed in the heart are also part of the I(Ks) signaling complex and contribute to its regulation by cAMP. PDE4D isoforms co-immunoprecipitated with I(Ks) channels in hearts of mice expressing the I(Ks) channel. In myocytes isolated from these mice, I(Ks) was increased by pharmacological PDE inhibition. PDE4D3, but not PDE4D5, co-immunoprecipitated with the I(Ks) channel only in Chinese hamster ovary cells co-expressing AKAP-9, and PDE4D3, but not PDE4D5, co-immunoprecipitated with AKAP-9. Functional experiments in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing AKAP-9 and either PDE4D3 or PDE4D5 isoforms revealed modulation of the I(Ks) response to cAMP by PDE4D3 but not PDE4D5. We conclude that PDE4D3, like protein kinase A and protein phosphatase 1, is recruited to the I(Ks) channel via AKAP-9 and contributes to its critical regulation by cAMP.",

        "Abstract": "The cardiac-delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(KS)) is carried by a complex of KCNQ1 (Q1) subunits, containing the voltage-sensor domains and the pore, and auxiliary KCNE1 (E1) subunits, required for the characteristic I(KS) voltage dependence and kinetics. To locate the transmembrane helix of E1 (E1-TM) relative to the Q1 TM helices (S1-S6), we mutated, one at a time, the first four residues flanking the extracellular ends of S1-S6 and E1-TM to Cys, coexpressed all combinations of Q1 and E1 Cys-substituted mutants in CHO cells, and determined the extents of spontaneous disulfide-bond formation. Cys-flanking E1-TM readily formed disulfides with Cys-flanking S1 and S6, much less so with the S3-S4 linker, and not at all with S2 or S5. These results imply that the extracellular flank of the E1-TM is located between S1 and S6 on different subunits of Q1. The salient functional effects of selected cross-links were as follows. A disulfide from E1 K41C to S1 I145C strongly slowed deactivation, and one from E1 L42C to S6 V324C eliminated deactivation. Given that E1-TM is between S1 and S6 and that K41C and L42C are likely to point approximately oppositely, these two cross-links are likely to favor similar axial rotations of E1-TM. In the opposite orientation, a disulfide from E1 K41C to S6 V324C slightly slowed activation, and one from E1 L42C to S1 I145C slightly speeded deactivation. Thus, the first E1 orientation strongly favors the open state, while the approximately opposite orientation favors the closed state.",

        "Abstract": "Co-assembly of KCNQ1 with different accessory, or beta, subunits that are members of the KCNE family results in potassium (K+) channels that conduct functionally distinct currents. The alpha subunit KCNQ1 conducts a slowly activated delayed rectifier K+ current (IKs), a major contributor to cardiac repolarization, when co-assembled with KCNE1 and channels that favor the open state when co-assembled with either KCNE2 or KCNE3. In the heart, stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system enhances IKs. A macromolecular signaling complex of the IKs channel including the targeting protein Yotiao coordinates up or downregulation of channel activity by protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of molecules in the complex. beta-adrenergic receptor mediated IKs upregulation, a functional consequence of PKA phosphorylation of the KCNQ1 amino terminus (N-T), requires co-expression of KCNQ1/Yotiao with KCNE1. Here, we report that co-expression of KCNE2, like KCNE1, confers a functional channel response to KCNQ1 phosphorylation, but co-expression of KCNE3 does not. Amino acid sequence comparison among the KCNE peptides, and KCNE1 truncation experiments, reveal a segment of the predicted intracellular KCNE1 carboxyl terminus (C-T) that is necessary for functional transduction of PKA phosphorylated KCNQ1. Moreover, chimera analysis reveals a region of KCNE1 sufficient to confer cAMP-dependent functional regulation upon the KCNQ1_KCNE3_Yotiao channel. The property of specific beta subunits to transduce post-translational regulation of alpha subunits of ion channels adds another dimension to our understanding molecular mechanisms underlying the diversity of regulation of native K+ channels.",

        "Title": "A novel LQT-3 mutation disrupts an inactivation gate complex with distinct rate-dependent phenotypic consequences.",
        "Abstract": "Inherited mutations of SCN5A, the gene that encodes Na(V)1.5, the alpha subunit of the principle voltage-gated Na(+) channel in the heart, cause congenital Long QT Syndrome variant 3 (LQT-3) by perturbation of channel inactivation. LQT-3 mutations induce small, but aberrant, inward current that prolongs the ventricular action potential and subjects mutation carriers to arrhythmia risk dictated in part by the biophysical consequences of the mutations. Most previously investigated LQT-3 mutations are associated with increased arrhythmia risk during rest or sleep. Here we report a novel LQT-3 mutation discovered in a pediatric proband diagnosed with LQTS but who experienced cardiac events during periods of mild exercise as well as rest. The mutation, which changes a single amino acid (S1904L) in the Na(V)1.5 carboxy terminal domain, disrupts the channel inactivation gate complex and promotes late Na(+) channel currents, not by promoting a bursting mode of gating, but by increasing the propensity of the channel to reopen during prolonged depolarization. Incorporating a modified version of the Markov model of the Na(V)1.5 channel into a mathematical model of the human ventricular action potential predicts that the biophysical consequences of the S1904L mutation result in action potential prolongation that is seen for all heart rates but, in contrast to other previously-investigated LQT-3 mutant channels, is most pronounced at fast rates resulting in a drastic reduction in the cells ability to adapt APD to heart rate.",

        "Title": "Leaky Ca2+ release channel/ryanodine receptor 2 causes seizures and sudden cardiac death in mice.",
        "Abstract": "The Ca2+ release channel ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) is required for excitation-contraction coupling in the heart and is also present in the brain. Mutations in RyR2 have been linked to exercise-induced sudden cardiac death (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [CPVT]). CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations result in \"leaky\" RyR2 channels due to the decreased binding of the calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) subunit, which stabilizes the closed state of the channel. We found that mice heterozygous for the R2474S mutation in Ryr2 (Ryr2-R2474S mice) exhibited spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures (which occurred in the absence of cardiac arrhythmias), exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Treatment with a novel RyR2-specific compound (S107) that enhances the binding of calstabin2 to the mutant Ryr2-R2474S channel inhibited the channel leak and prevented cardiac arrhythmias and raised the seizure threshold. Thus, CPVT-associated mutant leaky Ryr2-R2474S channels in the brain can cause seizures in mice, independent of cardiac arrhythmias. Based on these data, we propose that CPVT is a combined neurocardiac disorder in which leaky RyR2 channels in the brain cause epilepsy, and the same leaky channels in the heart cause exercise-induced sudden cardiac death.",

We screened a consecutive cohort of 18 children with cryptogenic partial epilepsy that was classified as pharmacoresistant because of nonresponse to carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, antiepileptic drugs that bind sodium channels. The novel coding variant SCN3A-K354Q was identified in one patient and was not present in 295 neurological normal controls. Twelve novel SNPs were also detected. K354Q substitutes glutamine for an evolutionarily conserved lysine residue in the pore domain of SCN3A. Functional analysis of this mutation in the backbone of the closely related gene SCN5A demonstrated an increase in persistent current that is similar in magnitude to epileptogenic mutations of SCN1A and SCN2A. This observation of a potentially pathogenic mutation of SCN3A (Nav1.3) indicates that this gene should be further evaluated for its contribution to childhood epilepsy.",

        "Abstract": "A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) recruit signaling molecules and present them to downstream targets to achieve efficient spatial and temporal control of their phosphorylation state. In the heart, sympathetic nervous system (SNS) regulation of cardiac action potential duration (APD), mediated by beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) activation, requires assembly of AKAP9 (Yotiao) with the I(Ks) potassium channel alpha subunit (KCNQ1). KCNQ1 mutations that disrupt this complex cause type 1 long-QT syndrome (LQT1), one of the potentially lethal heritable arrhythmia syndromes. Here, we report identification of (i) regions on Yotiao critical to its binding to KCNQ1 and (ii) a single putative LQTS-causing mutation (S1570L) in AKAP9 (Yotiao) localized to the KCNQ1 binding domain in 1/50 (2%) subjects with a clinically robust phenotype for LQTS but absent in 1,320 reference alleles. The inherited S1570L mutation reduces the interaction between KCNQ1 and Yotiao, reduces the cAMP-induced phosphorylation of the channel, eliminates the functional response of the I(Ks) channel to cAMP, and prolongs the action potential in a computational model of the ventricular cardiocyte. These reconstituted cellular consequences of the inherited S1570L-Yotiao mutation are consistent with delayed repolarization of the ventricular action potential observed in the affected siblings. Thus, we have demonstrated a link between genetic perturbations in AKAP and human disease in general and AKAP9 and LQTS in particular.",

        "Abstract": "SCN5A encodes the alpha-subunit (Na(v)1.5) of the principle Na(+) channel in the human heart. Genetic lesions in SCN5A can cause congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) variant 3 (LQT-3) in adults by disrupting inactivation of the Na(v)1.5 channel. Pharmacological targeting of mutation-altered Na(+) channels has proven promising in developing a gene-specific therapeutic strategy to manage specifically this LQTS variant. SCN5A mutations that cause similar channel dysfunction may also contribute to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and other arrhythmias in newborns, but the prevalence, impact, and therapeutic management of SCN5A mutations may be distinct in infants compared with adults.",

        "Abstract": "Inherited gain-of-function mutations of genes coding for subunits of the heart slow potassium (I Ks) channel can cause familial atrial fibrillation (AF). Here we consider a potentially more prevalent mechanism and hypothesize that beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR)-mediated regulation of the I Ks channel, a natural gain-of-function pathway, can also lead to AF. Using a transgenic I Ks channel mouse model, we studied the role of the channel and its regulation by beta-AR stimulation on atrial arrhythmias. In vivo administration of isoprenaline (isoproterenol) predisposes I Ks channel transgenic mice but not wild-type (WT) littermates that lack I Ks to prolonged atrial arrhythmias. Patch-clamp analysis demonstrated expression and isoprenaline-mediated regulation of I Ks in atrial myocytes from transgenic but not WT littermates. Furthermore, computational modelling revealed that beta-AR stimulation-dependent accumulation of open I Ks channels accounts for the pro-arrhythmic substrate. Our results provide evidence that beta-AR-regulated I Ks channels can play a role in AF and imply that specific I Ks deregulation, perhaps through disruption of the I Ks macromolecular complex necessary for beta-AR-mediated I Ks channel regulation, may be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating this most common arrhythmia.",

Indeed, dysfunctional sodium channels have been shown to be responsible for several inherited cardiac electrical disorders, such as Long QT and Brugada syndromes (BrS), potentially leading to fatal arrhythmic events. Genetic approaches and functional experiments using heterologous systems have enabled the characterization of the molecular determinants involved in these disorders and their consequences on ion channel function. The improved understanding of the mechanisms leading to these cardiac arrhythmic events represents a first step in the development of therapeutic treatments.",

        "Abstract": "Stress-dependent regulation of cardiac action potential duration is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. It is accompanied by an increased magnitude of the slow outward potassium ion current, I(Ks). KCNQ1 and KCNE1 subunits coassemble to form the I(Ks) channel. Mutations in either subunit cause long QT syndrome, an inherited cardiac arrhythmia associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Here we demonstrate that exocytosis of KCNQ1 proteins to the plasma membrane requires the small GTPase RAB11, whereas endocytosis is dependent on RAB5. We further demonstrate that RAB-dependent KCNQ1/KCNE1 exocytosis is enhanced by the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1, and requires phosphorylation and activation of phosphoinositide 3-phosphate 5-kinase and the generation of PI(3,5)P(2). Identification of KCNQ1/KCNE1 recycling and its modulation by serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1-phosphoinositide 3-phosphate 5-kinase -PI(3,5)P(2) provides a mechanistic insight into stress-induced acceleration of cardiac repolarization.",

Here we tested the hypothesis that cellular electrical dysfunction, caused not only by action potential prolongation but also by mutation-altered Na(+) entry, distinguishes LQT3 from other LQTS variants and may contribute to its distinct lethality. We compared cellular electrical activity in myocytes isolated from mice heterozygous for the DeltaKPQ mutation (DeltaKPQ) and myocytes from wild-type littermates. Current-clamp pause protocols induced rate-dependent spontaneous diastolic activity (delayed after depolarizations) in 6 of 7 DeltaKPQ, but no wild-type, myocytes (n=11) tested. Voltage-clamp pause protocols that independently control depolarization duration and interpulse interval identified a distinct contribution of both depolarization duration and mutant Na(+) channel activity to the generation of Ca(i)(2+)-dependent diastolic transient inward current. This was found at rates and depolarization durations relevant both to the mouse model and to LQT3 patients. Flecainide, which preferentially inhibits mutation-altered late Na(+) current and is used to treat LQT3 patients, suppresses transient inward current formation in voltage-clamped DeltaKPQ myocytes. Our results demonstrate a marked contribution of mutation-altered Na(+) entry to the incidence of pause-dependent spontaneous diastolic activity in DeltaKPQ myocytes and suggest that altered Na(+) entry may contribute to the elevated lethality of LQT3 versus other LQTS variants.",

        "Abstract": "Perturbation of sodium channel inactivation, a finely tuned process that critically regulates the flow of sodium ions into excitable cells, is a common functional consequence of inherited mutations associated with epilepsy, skeletal muscle disease, autism, and cardiac arrhythmias. Understanding the structural basis of inactivation is key to understanding these disorders. Here we identify a novel role for a structural motif in the COOH terminus of the heart NaV1.5 sodium channel in determining channel inactivation. Structural modeling predicts an interhelical hydrophobic interface between paired EF hands in the proximal region of the NaV1.5 COOH terminus. The predicted interface is conserved among almost all EF hand-containing proteins and is the locus of a number of disease-associated mutations. Using the structural model as a guide, we provide biochemical and biophysical evidence that the structural integrity of this interface is necessary for proper Na+ channel inactivation gating. We thus demonstrate a novel role of the sodium channel COOH terminus structure in the control of channel inactivation and in pathologies caused by inherited mutations that disrupt it.",

        "Abstract": "Electrical activity in the heart depends critically on the interactions of multiple ion channels to coordinate the timing of excitation and contraction of the ventricles. Voltage-gated sodium channels underlie the rapid spread of impulses through the atria and ventricles, but the importance of sodium (Na(+)) channels to the control of the ventricular action potential has only most recently become apparent through the investigation of the relationship between mutation-induced clinical phenotypes and the altered function of mutant Na(+) channels linked to inherited arrhythmias. Investigation into the structural basis of disease-associated mutations of the cardiac Na(+) channel has led to the discovery of novel role of the Na(+) channel carboxy-terminal (CT) domain in controlling channel inactivation. Intramolecular interactions between the carboxy-terminal domain and an intracellular peptide loop that forms the inactivation gate are required to minimize channel reopening during prolonged depolarization. Disruption of this interaction leads to persistent sodium channel current, action potential prolongation, and elevated risk of cardiac arrhythmia.",

        "Abstract": "Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a form of exercise-induced sudden cardiac death that has been linked to mutations in the cardiac Ca2+ release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR2) located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We have shown that catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia-linked RyR2 mutations significantly decrease the binding affinity for calstabin-2 (FKBP12.6), a subunit that stabilizes the closed state of the channel. We have proposed that RyR2-mediated diastolic SR Ca2+ leak triggers ventricular tachycardia (VT) and sudden cardiac death. In calstabin-2-deficient mice, we have now documented diastolic SR Ca2+ leak, monophasic action potential alternans, and bidirectional VT. Calstabin-deficient cardiomyocytes exhibited SR Ca2+ leak-induced aberrant transient inward currents in diastole consistent with delayed after-depolarizations. The 1,4-benzothiazepine JTV519, which increases the binding affinity of calstabin-2 for RyR2, inhibited the diastolic SR Ca2+ leak, monophasic action potential alternans and triggered arrhythmias. Our data suggest that calstabin-2 deficiency is as a critical mediator of triggers that initiate cardiac arrhythmias.",

        "Abstract": "Cardiac function is regulated critically by the autonomic nervous system to adapt to the physical activity and emotional stress. A slowly activating cardiac potassium channel (I(Ks)) is modulated by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and contributes to cardiac action potential shortening in the face of concomitant increases in heart rate. Activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in response to SNS stimulation results in protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of I(Ks) channels. We have found that the functional regulation of the I(Ks) channel by PKA requires the A kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP) Yotiao. Yotiao forms a macromolecular complex with the channel and recruits key enzymes such as PKA and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to control the phosphorylation state of I(Ks). Our recent findings revealed a more active role of Yotiao in the PKA modulation of I(Ks). We found that Yotiao participates actively in translating the phosphorylation-induced change into altered channel activity. Moreover Yotiao itself can be phosphorylated by PKA upon beta-adrenergic stimulation. Ablation of Yotiao phosphorylation impairs PKA-induced changes in I(Ks) voltage-dependent activation and current kinetics. Taken together we have evidence to suggest that Yotiao plays dual roles in the PKA modulation of the I(Ks) channel. It acts not only as an adaptor protein to coordinate enzymatic reactions but also as an active regulator that directly affects channel function.",

In different regions of the heart, action potential waveforms are distinct, owing to differences in Na(+), Ca(2+), and K(+) channel expression, and these differences contribute to the normal, unidirectional propagation of activity and to the generation of normal cardiac rhythms. Changes in channel functioning, resulting from inherited or acquired disease, affect action potential repolarization and can lead to the generation of life-threatening arrhythmias. There is, therefore, considerable interest in understanding the mechanisms that control cardiac repolarization and rhythm generation. Electrophysiological studies have detailed the properties of the Na(+), Ca(2+), and K(+) currents that generate cardiac action potentials, and molecular cloning has revealed a large number of pore forming (alpha) and accessory (beta, delta, and gamma) subunits thought to contribute to the formation of these channels. Considerable progress has been made in defining the functional roles of the various channels and in identifying the alpha-subunits encoding these channels. Much less is known, however, about the functioning of channel accessory subunits and/or posttranslational processing of the channel proteins. It has also become clear that cardiac ion channels function as components of macromolecular complexes, comprising the alpha-subunits, one or more accessory subunit, and a variety of other regulatory proteins. In addition, these macromolecular channel protein complexes appear to interact with the actin cytoskeleton and/or the extracellular matrix, suggesting important functional links between channel complexes, as well as between cardiac structure and electrical functioning. Important areas of future research will be the identification of (all of) the molecular components of functional cardiac ion channels and delineation of the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the expression and the functioning of these channels in the normal and the diseased myocardium.",

        "Abstract": "Ion channels are pore-forming proteins that provide pathways for the controlled movement of ions into or out of cells. Ionic movement across cell membranes is critical for essential and physiological processes ranging from control of the strength and duration of the heartbeat to the regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. Diseases caused by mutations in genes that encode ion channel subunits or regulatory proteins are referred to as channelopathies. As might be expected based on the diverse roles of ion channels, channelopathies range from inherited cardiac arrhythmias, to muscle disorders, to forms of diabetes. This series of reviews examines the roles of ion channels in health and disease.",

        "Abstract": "Regulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system, fundamental to the physiological response to stress and exercise, requires coordinated phosphorylation of multiple downstream molecular targets, including the I(Ks) (slowly activating potassium current) channel. Sympathetic nervous system stimulation increases intracellular cAMP for which targeted regulation is directed in large part by distinct scaffold or anchoring proteins. Yotiao is an A-kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP) that recruits the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A (PKA)) and protein phosphatase 1 to the carboxyl terminus of the I(Ks) channel to form a molecular complex and control its phosphorylation state, crucial to the cardiac cellular response to sympathetic nervous system stimulation. Here we report that Yotiao itself is a substrate for PKA phosphorylation, and we identify a Yotiao amino-terminal (N-T) residue (Ser-43) that is PKA-phosphorylated in response to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation. The replacement of Ser-43 by Ala ablates the PKA phosphorylation of N-T Yotiao and markedly diminishes the functional response of the wild type and pseudo-phosphorylated I(Ks) channel to cAMP but neither prevents the PKA phosphorylation of KCNQ1 nor its binding to Yotiao. These results suggest, for the first time, a critical role for the PKA phosphorylation of an AKAP in the functional regulation of an ion channel protein and postphosphorylation allosteric modulation of the I(Ks) channel by Yotiao.",

Its importance for normal heart function has been recently exemplified by reports of numerous mutations found in the gene SCN5A--which encodes Na(v)1.5--in patients with various pathologic cardiac phenotypes, indicating that even subtle alterations of Na(v)1.5 cell biology and function may underlie human diseases. Similar to other ion channels, Na(v)1.5 is most likely part of dynamic multiprotein complexes located in the different cellular compartments. This review focuses on five intracellular proteins that have been recently reported to directly bind to and contribute to the regulation of Na(v)1.5: ankyrin proteins, fibroblast growth factor homologous factor 1B, calmodulin, Nedd4-like ubiquitin-protein ligases, and syntrophin proteins.",

        "Title": "Autonomic control of cardiac action potentials: role of potassium channel kinetics in response to sympathetic stimulation.",
        "Abstract": "I(Ks), the slowly activating component of the delayed rectifier current, plays a major role in repolarization of the cardiac action potential (AP). Genetic mutations in the alpha- (KCNQ1) and beta- (KCNE1) subunits of I(Ks) underlie Long QT Syndrome type 1 and 5 (LQT-1 and LQT-5), respectively, and predispose carriers to the development of polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. beta-adrenergic stimulation increases I(Ks) and results in rate dependent AP shortening, a control system that can be disrupted by some mutations linked to LQT-1 and LQT-5. The mechanisms by which I(Ks) regulates action potential duration (APD) during beta-adrenergic stimulation at different heart rates are not known, nor are the consequences of mutation induced disruption of this regulation. Here we develop a complementary experimental and theoretical approach to address these questions. We reconstituted I(Ks) in CHO cells (ie, KCNQ1 coexpressed with KCNE1 and the adaptator protein Yotiao) and quantitatively examined the effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation on channel kinetics. We then developed theoretical models of I(Ks) in the absence and presence of beta-adrenergic stimulation. We simulated the effects of sympathetic stimulation on channel activation (speeding) and deactivation (slowing) kinetics on the whole cell action potential under different pacing conditions. The model suggests these kinetic effects are critically important in rate-dependent control of action potential duration. We also investigate the effects of two LQT-5 mutations that alter kinetics and impair sympathetic stimulation of I(Ks) and show the likely mechanism by which they lead to tachyarrhythmias and indicate a distinct role of I(KS) kinetics in this electrical dysfunction.

        "Abstract": "Mutations in cardiac Na(+) and K(+) channels can disrupt the precise balance of ionic currents that underlies normal cardiac excitation and relaxation. Disruption of this equilibrium can result in arrhythmogenic phenotypes leading to syncope, seizures, and sudden cardiac death. Congenital defects result in an unpredictable expression of phenotypes with variable penetrance, even within single families. Additionally, phenotypically opposite and overlapping cardiac arrhythmogenic syndromes can stem from one mutation. A number of these defects have been characterized experimentally with the aim of understanding mechanisms of mutation-induced arrhythmia. Improving understanding of abnormalities may provide a basis for the development of therapeutic approaches.",

        "Abstract": "A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) are thought to be passive members of protein complexes that coordinate the association of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) with cellular substrates to facilitate targeted PKA protein phosphorylation. I(Ks), the slow heart potassium current, is carried by the I(Ks) potassium channel, a substrate for PKA phosphorylation in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation, is a macromolecular complex that includes the KCNQ1 alpha subunit, the KCNE1 regulatory subunit, and the AKAP Yotiao. Disruption of this regulation by mutation in the long QT syndrome is associated with elevated risk of sudden death. Here, we have studied the effects of the AKAP Yotiao on the function of the I(Ks) channel that had been mutated to simulate channel phosphorylation, and we report direct AKAP-mediated alteration of channel function distinct from its role in the coordination of channel phosphorylation by PKA. These data reveal previously undescribed actions of Yotiao that occur subsequent to channel phosphorylation and provide evidence that this adaptor protein also may serve as an effector in regulating this important ion channel.",

        "Title": "Calmodulin mediates Ca2+ sensitivity of sodium channels.",
        "Abstract": "Ca2+ has been proposed to regulate Na+ channels through the action of calmodulin (CaM) bound to an IQ motif or through direct binding to a paired EF hand motif in the Nav1 C terminus. Mutations within these sites cause cardiac arrhythmias or autism, but details about how Ca2+ confers sensitivity are poorly understood. Studies on the homologous Cav1.2 channel revealed non-canonical CaM interactions, providing a framework for exploring Na+ channels. In contrast to previous reports, we found that Ca2+ does not bind directly to Na+ channel C termini. Rather, Ca2+ sensitivity appears to be mediated by CaM bound to the C termini in a manner that differs significantly from CaM regulation of Cav1.2. In Nav1.2 or Nav1.5, CaM bound to a localized region containing the IQ motif and did not support the large Ca(2+)-dependent conformational change seen in the Cav1.2.CaM complex. Furthermore, CaM binding to Nav1 C termini lowered Ca2+ binding affinity and cooperativity among the CaM-binding sites compared with CaM alone. Nonetheless, we found suggestive evidence for Ca2+/CaM-dependent effects upon Nav1 channels. The R1902C autism mutation conferred a Ca(2+)-dependent conformational change in Nav1.2 C terminus.CaM complex that was absent in the wild-type complex. In Nav1.5, CaM modulates the Cterminal interaction with the III-IV linker, which has been suggested as necessary to stabilize the inactivation gate, to minimize sustained channel activity during depolarization, and to prevent cardiac arrhythmias that lead to sudden death. Together, these data offer new biochemical evidence for Ca2+/CaM modulation of Na+ channel function.",

        "Abstract": "The cardiac slow delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKs), comprised of (KCNQ1) and beta (KCNE1) subunits, is regulated by sympathetic nervous stimulation, with activation of beta-adrenergic receptors PKA phosphorylating IKs channels. We examined the effects of 2-adrenergic receptors (beta2-AR) on IKs in cardiac ventricular myocytes from transgenic mice expressing fusion proteins of IKs subunits and hbeta2-ARs. KCNQ1 and beta2-ARs were localized to the same subcellular regions, sharing intimate localization within nanometers of each other. In IKs/B2-AR myocytes, IKs density was increased, and activation shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction; IKs was not further modulated by exposure to isoproterenol, and KCNQ1 was found to be PKA-phosphorylated. Conversely, beta2-AR overexpression did not affect L-type calcium channel current (ICaL) under basal conditions with ICaL remaining responsive to cAMP. These data indicate intimate association of KCNQ1 and beta2-ARs and that beta2-AR signaling can modulate the function of IKs channels under conditions of increased beta2-AR expression, even in the absence of exogenous beta-AR agonist.",

        "Title": "Cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.5 is regulated by Nedd4-2 mediated ubiquitination.",
        "Abstract": "Na(v)1.5, the cardiac isoform of the voltage-gated Na+ channel, is critical to heart excitability and conduction. However, the mechanisms regulating its expression at the cell membrane are poorly understood. The Na(v)1.5 C-terminus contains a PY-motif (xPPxY) that is known to act as binding site for Nedd4/Nedd4-like ubiquitin-protein ligases. Because Nedd4-2 is well expressed in the heart, we investigated its role in the ubiquitination and regulation of Na(v)1.5. Yeast two-hybrid and GST-pulldown experiments revealed an interaction between Na(v)1.5 C-terminus and Nedd4-2, which was abrogated by mutating the essential tyrosine of the PY-motif. Ubiquitination of Na(v)1.5 was detected in both transfected HEK cells and heart extracts. Furthermore, Nedd4-2-dependent ubiquitination of Na(v)1.5 was observed. To test for a functional role of Nedd4-2, patch-clamp experiments were performed on HEK cells expressing wild-type and mutant forms of both Na(v)1.5 and Nedd4-2. Na(v)1.5 current density was decreased by 65% upon Nedd4-2 cotransfection, whereas the PY-motif mutant channels were not affected. In contrast, a catalytically inactive Nedd4-2 had no effect, indicating that ubiquitination mediates this downregulation. However, Nedd4-2 did not alter the whole-cell or the single channel biophysical properties of Na(v)1.5. Consistent with the functional findings, localization at the cell periphery of Na(v)1.5-YFP fusion proteins was reduced upon Nedd4-2 coexpression. The Nedd4-1 isoform did not regulate Na(v)1.5, suggesting that Nedd4-2 is a specific regulator of Na(v)1.5. These results demonstrate that Na(v)1.5 can be ubiquitinated in heart tissues and that the ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2 acts on Na(v)1.5 by decreasing the channel density at the cell surface.",

        "Abstract": "Epilepsy is a paroxysmal neurological disorder resulting from abnormal cellular excitability and is a common cause of disability. Recently, some forms of idiopathic epilepsy have been causally related to genetic mutations in neuronal ion channels. To understand disease mechanisms, it is crucial to understand how a gene defect can disrupt channel gating, which in turn can affect complex cellular dynamic processes. We develop a theoretical Markovian model of the neuronal Na+ channel NaV1.1 to explore and explain gating mechanisms underlying cellular excitability and physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of abnormal neuronal excitability in the context of epilepsy. Genetic epilepsy has been shown to result from both mutations that give rise to a gain of channel function and from those that reduce the Na+ current. These data may suggest that abnormal excitation can result from both hyperexcitability and hypoexcitability, the mechanisms of which are presumably distinct, and as yet elusive. Revelation of the molecular origins will allow for translation into targeted pharmacological interventions that must be developed to treat syndromes resulting from divergent mechanisms. This work represents a first step in developing a comprehensive theoretical model to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying runaway excitation that cause epilepsy.",

        "Abstract": "Electrical activity in nerve, skeletal muscle, and heart requires finely tuned activity of voltage-gated Na+ channels that open and then enter a nonconducting inactivated state upon depolarization. Inactivation occurs when the gate, the cytoplasmic loop linking domains III and IV of the alpha subunit, occludes the open pore. Subtle destabilization of inactivation by mutation is causally associated with diverse human disease. Here we show for the first time that the inactivation gate is a molecular complex consisting of the III-IV loop and the COOH terminus (C-T), which is necessary to stabilize the closed gate and minimize channel reopening. When this interaction is disrupted by mutation, inactivation is destabilized allowing a small, but important, fraction of channels to reopen, conduct inward current, and delay cellular repolarization. Thus, our results demonstrate for the first time that physiologically crucial stabilization of inactivation of the Na+ channel requires complex interactions of intracellular structures and indicate a novel structural role of the C-T domain in this process.",

Disruption of this equilibrium by genetic defects, polymorphisms, therapeutic intervention, and structural abnormalities can cause arrhythmogenic phenotypes leading to syncope, seizures, and sudden cardiac death.

Additionally, phenotypically opposite and overlapping cardiac arrhythmogenic syndromes can even stem from the same mutation. Accordingly, the relationship between genetic mutations and clinical syndromes is becoming increasingly complex.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations associated with sodium channel-linked inherited Long-QT syndrome often result in a gain of channel function by disrupting channel inactivation. A small fraction of channels fail to inactivate (burst) at depolarized potentials where normal (wild type) channels fully inactivate. These noninactivating channels give rise to a sustained macroscopic current. We studied the effects of protein kinase A stimulation on sustained current in wild type and three disease-linked C-terminal mutant channels (D1790G, Y1795C, and Y1795H). We show that protein kinase A stimulation differentially affects gating in the mutant channels. Wild type, Y1795C, and Y1795H channels are insensitive to protein kinase A stimulation, whereas \"bursting\" in the D1790G mutant is markedly enhanced by protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation. Our results suggest that the charge at position 1790 of the C terminus of the channel modulates the response of the cardiac sodium channel to protein kinase A stimulation and that phosphorylation of residue 36 in the N terminus and residue 525 in the cytoplasmic linker joining domains I and II of the channel alpha subunit facilitate destabilization of inactivation and thereby increase sustained current.",

An example presented here, the SCN5A LQTS mutant I1768V, does not act to increase Isus (<0.1% of peak) compared with wild-type (WT) channels.

        "Abstract": "Congenital long QT syndrome type 3 (LQT3) is caused by mutations in the gene SCN5A encoding the alpha-subunit of the cardiac Na(+) channel (Nav1.5). Functional studies of SCN5A mutations in the linker between domains III and IV, and more recently the C-terminus, have been shown to alter inactivation gating. Here we report a novel LQT3 mutation, L619F (LF), located in the domain I-II linker. In an infant with prolonged QTc intervals, mutational analysis identified a heterozygous missense mutation (L619F) in the domain I-II linker of the cardiac Na(+) channel. Wild-type (WT) and mutant channels were studied by whole-cell patch-clamp analysis in transiently expressed HEK cells. LF channels increase maintained Na(+) current (0.79 pA/pF for LF; 0.26 pA/pF for WT) during prolonged depolarization. We found a +5.8mV shift in steady state inactivation in LF channels compared to WT (WT, V(1/2)=-64.0 mV; LF, V(1/2)=-58.2 mV). The positive shift of inactivation, without a corresponding shift in activation, increases the overlap window current in LF relative to WT (1.09 vs. 0.58 pA/pF), as measured using a positive voltage ramp protocol (-100 to +50 mV in 2s). The increase in window current, combined with an increase in non-inactivating Na(+) current, may act to prolong the AP plateau and is consistent with the disease phenotype observed in patients. Moreover, the defective inactivation imposed by the L619F mutation implies a role for the I-II linker in the Na(+) channel inactivation process.",

        "Title": "Common molecular determinants of flecainide and lidocaine block of heart Na+ channels: evidence from experiments with neutral and quaternary flecainide analogues.",
        "Abstract": "Flecainide (pKa 9.3, 99% charged at pH 7.4) and lidocaine (pKa 7.6-8.0, approximately 50% neutral at pH 7.4) have similar structures but markedly different effects on Na(+) channel activity. Both drugs cause well-characterized use-dependent block (UDB) of Na(+) channels due to stabilization of the inactivated state, but flecainide requires that channels first open before block develops, whereas lidocaine is believed to bind directly to the inactivated state. To test whether the charge on flecainide might determine its state specificity of Na(+) channel blockade, we developed two flecainide analogues, NU-FL (pKa 6.4), that is 90% neutral at pH 7.4, and a quaternary flecainide analogue, QX-FL, that is fully charged at physiological pH. We examined the effects of flecainide, NU-FL, QX-FL, and lidocaine on human cardiac Na(+) channels expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. At physiological pH, NU-FL, like lidocaine but not flecainide, interacts preferentially with inactivated channels without prerequisite channel opening, and causes minimal UDB. We find that UDB develops predominantly by the charged form of flecainide as evidenced by investigation of QX-FL at physiological pH and NU-FL investigated over a more acidic pH range where its charged fraction is increased. QX-FL is a potent blocker of channels when applied from inside the cell, but acts very weakly with external application. UDB by QX-FL, like flecainide, develops only after channels open. Once blocked, channels recover very slowly from QX-FL block, apparently without requisite channel opening. Our data strongly suggest that it is the difference in degree of ionization (pKa) between lidocaine and flecainide, rather than gross structural features, that determines distinction in block of cardiac Na(+) channels. The data also suggest that the two drugs share a common receptor but, consistent with the modulated receptor hypothesis, reach this receptor by distinct routes dictated by the degree of ionization of the drug molecules.",

        "Abstract": "Beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation increases heart rate and shortens ventricular action-potential duration, the latter effect due in part to a cAMP-dependent increase in the slow outward potassium current (I(Ks)). Mutations in either KCNQ1 or KCNE1, the I(Ks) subunits, are associated with variants (LQT-1 and LQT-5) of the congenital long QT syndrome. We now show that cAMP-mediated functional regulation of KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels, a consequence of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A phosphorylation of the KCNQ1 N terminus, requires coexpression of KCNQ1 with KCNE1, its auxiliary subunit. Further, at least two KCNE1 mutations linked to LQT-5 (D76N and W87R) cause functional disruption of cAMP-mediated KCNQ1/KCNE1-channel regulation despite the response of the substrate protein (KCNQ1) to protein kinase A phosphorylation. Transduction of protein phosphorylation into physiologically necessary channel function represents a previously uncharacterized role for the KCNE1 auxiliary subunit, which can be disrupted in LQT-5.",

        "Abstract": "Pharmacological intervention, often for the purpose of treating syndromes unrelated to cardiac disease, can increase the vulnerability of some patients to life-threatening rhythm disturbances. This may be due to an underlying propensity stemming from genetic defects or polymorphisms, or structural abnormalities that provide a substrate allowing for the initiation of arrhythmic triggers. A number of pharmacological agents that have proven useful in the treatment of allergic reactions, gastrointestinal disorders, and psychotic disorders, among others, have been shown to reduce repolarizing K(+) currents and prolong the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. Understanding the structural determinants of K(+) channel blockade may provide new insights into the mechanism and rate-dependent effects of drugs on cellular physiology. Drug-induced disruption of cellular repolarization underlies electrocardiographic abnormalities that are diagnostic indicators of arrhythmia susceptibility.",

        "Title": "Insights into the molecular mechanisms of bradycardia-triggered arrhythmias in long QT-3 syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "Congenital long QT syndrome is a rare disease in which the electrocardiogram QT interval is prolonged due to dysfunctional ventricular repolarization. Variant 3 (LQT-3) is associated with mutations in SCN5A, the gene coding for the heart Na(+) channel alpha subunit. Arrhythmias in LQT-3 mutation carriers are more likely to occur at rest, when heart rate is slow. Several LQT-3 Na(+) channel mutations exert their deleterious effects by promoting a mode of Na(+) channel gating wherein a fraction of channels fails to inactivate. This gating mode, termed \"bursting, \" results in sustained macroscopic inward Na(+) channel current (I(sus)), which can delay repolarization and prolong the QT interval. However, the mechanism of heart-rate dependence of I(sus) has been unresolved at the single-channel level. We investigate an LQT-3 mutant (Y1795C) using experimental and theoretical frameworks to elucidate the molecular mechanism of I(sus) rate dependence. Our results indicate that mutation-induced changes in the length of time mutant channels spend bursting, rather than how readily they burst, determines I(sus) inverse heart-rate dependence. Our results indicate that mutation-induced changes in the length of time mutant channels spend bursting, rather than how readily they burst, determines I(sus) inverse heart-rate dependence. These results link mutation-induced changes in Na+ channel gating mode transitions to heart rate-dependent changes in cellular electrical activity underlying a key LQT-3 clinical phenotype.",

Mice expressing human I(Ks) channels were anesthetized, and an electrocardiogram and monophasic action potentials (MAP) recorded from the left ventricle. Sinus rate was not different between wild-type mice (WT) and transgenic mice (TG). Infusion of isoproterenol accelerated WT heart rate but not TG. Lack of TG sinus rate responsiveness may have resulted from accumulated outward current in I(Ks) channels in sinus node. Ventricular MAP duration of TG mice to 50% repolarization (APD(50)) during ventricular pacing was shorter than WT, likely resulting from outward current through I(Ks) channels. TG APD(50) showed enhanced responsiveness (shortening) to isoproterenol compared with WT. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were initiated in TG mice by programmed stimulation but not in WT and were accelerated by isoproterenol. I(Ks) channels impart beta-adrenergic sensitivity to the ventricles and may be responsible for ventricular tachyarrhythmias.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in the gene (SCN5A) encoding the alpha-subunit of the cardiac Na+ channel cause congenital long QT syndrome (LQT-3). Here we describe a novel LQT-3 mutation I1768V (I1768V) located in the sixth transmembrane spanning segment of domain IV. This mutation is unusual in that it is located within a transmembrane spanning domain and does not promote the typically observed sustained inward current corresponding to a gain of channel function (bursting). Rather, I1768V increases the rate of recovery from inactivation and increases the channel availability, observed as a positive shift of the steady-state inactivation curve (+7.6 mV). Using a Markovian model of the cardiac Na+ channel, we simulated these changes in gating behavior and demonstrated that a small increase in the rate of recovery from inactivation is sufficient to explain all of the experimentally observed current changes. The effect of these alterations in channel gating results in an increase in window current that may act to disrupt cardiac repolarization.",

        "Abstract": "Every year, approximately 450,000 individuals in the United States die suddenly of cardiac arrhythmia. We identified a variant of the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A that is associated with arrhythmia in African Americans (P = 0.000028) and linked with arrhythmia risk in an African-American family (P = 0.005). In transfected cells, the variant allele (Y1102) accelerated channel activation, increasing the likelihood of abnormal cardiac repolarization and arrhythmia. About 13.2% of African Americans carry the Y1102 allele. Because Y1102 has a subtle effect on risk, most carriers will never have an arrhythmia. However, Y1102 may be a useful molecular marker for the prediction of arrhythmia susceptibility in the context of additional acquired risk factors such as the use of certain medications.",

        "Abstract": "Na(+) channel blockers such as flecainide have found renewed usefulness in the diagnosis and treatment of two clinical syndromes arising from inherited mutations in SCN5A, the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the cardiac voltage-gated Na(+) channel. The Brugada syndrome (BrS) and the LQT-3 variant of the Long QT syndrome are caused by disease-linked SCN5A mutations that act to change functional and pharmacological properties of the channel. Here we have explored a set of SCN5A mutations linked both to BrS and LQT-3 to determine what disease-modified channel properties underlie distinct responses to the Na(+) channel blocker flecainide. We focused on flecainide block that develops with repetitive channel activity, so-called use-dependent block (UDB). Our results indicate that mutation-induced changes in the voltage-dependence of channel availability (inactivation) may act as determinants of flecainide block. The data further indicate that UDB by flecainide requires channel opening, but is not likely due to open channel block. Rather, flecainide appears to interact with inactivation states that follow depolarization-induced channel opening, and mutation-induced changes in channel inactivation will alter flecainide block independent of the disease to which the mutation is linked. Analysis of flecainide block of mutant channels linked to these rare disorders has provided novel insight into the molecular determinants of drug action.",

Mutations in two human I(KS) channel subunits, hKCNQ1 and hKCNE1, prolong APD and cause inherited cardiac arrhythmias known as LQTS (long QT syndrome). We show that betaAR modulation of I(KS) requires targeting of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to hKCNQ1 through the targeting protein yotiao. Yotiao binds to hKCNQ1 by a leucine zipper motif, which is disrupted by an LQTS mutation (hKCNQ1-G589D). Identification of the hKCNQ1 macromolecular complex provides a mechanism for SNS modulation of cardiac APD through IKS.",

        "Title": "Secondary structure of the human cardiac Na+ channel C terminus: evidence for a role of helical structures in modulation of channel inactivation.",
        "Abstract": "Little is known about the structure of the C terminus of the human cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel alpha subunit (SCN5A), but disease-linked mutations within this 244-amino acid intracellular region of the channel have marked effects on channel inactivation. Here we report a structural analysis of the C-terminal tail of the cardiac Na(+) channel that sheds new light on mechanisms that control its inactivation gating. Homology modeling of the SCN5A C terminus predicts predominant alpha-helical structure (six helices) in the proximal half of this intracellular tail but little structure in the distal half. Circular dichroism of isolated and purified C terminus supports this prediction. Whole cell and single channel patch clamp recordings of wild type and mutant alpha subunits co-expressed with the hbeta(1) subunit in HEK 293 cells indicate that truncation of the distal, nonstructured, C terminus (L1921stop mutant) reduces current density but does not affect channel gating (n = 6). In contrast, truncation of the sixth helix containing a concentration of positively charged residues along with the distal C terminus (S1885stop mutant) also reduces current density but, in addition, has profound and selective effects on inactivation (no effect on activation). Channel availability is shifted (-11 +/- 0.6 mV), and there is a 10-fold increase in the percentage of channels that burst (fail to inactivate) during prolonged depolarization (0.025% S1885stop (n = 7) versus 0.0028% wild type (n = 9), p < 0.005). These results suggest that the charged structured region of the SCN5A C terminus plays a major role in channel inactivation, stabilizing the inactivated state.",
