        "Abstract": "Adsorptive separation of Xe and Kr is an industrially promising but challenging process because of their identical shape and similar physicochemical properties. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy through rationally designing the linkers of anionic functional ultramicroporous materials (FUMs) to finely regulate the pore chemistry and architecture, which creates unique stepped channels incorporating dense polar nanotraps to generate a larger effective pore space and enables dense packing of Xe. A new hydrolytically stable FUM (ZUL-530) was prepared, which for the first time achieves a Xe packing density exceeding the liquid Xe density at atmospheric conditions in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (based on experimental data), resulting in both excellent Xe uptake (2.55 mmol g",

Although replication proteins that facilitate parental histone transfer have been identified, how intact histone H3-H4 tetramers travel from the front to the back of the replication fork remains unknown. Here, we use AlphaFold-Multimer structural predictions combined with biochemical and genetic approaches to identify the Mrc1/CLASPIN subunit of the replisome as a histone chaperone. Mrc1 contains a conserved histone-binding domain that forms a brace around the H3-H4 tetramer mimicking nucleosomal DNA and H2A-H2B histones, is required for heterochromatin inheritance, and promotes parental histone recycling during replication. We further identify binding sites for the FACT histone chaperone in Swi1/TIMELESS and DNA polymerase \u03b1 that are required for heterochromatin inheritance. We propose that Mrc1, in concert with FACT acting as a mobile co-chaperone, coordinates the distribution of parental histones to newly replicated DNA.",

        "Abstract": "Chromatin-based epigenetic memory relies on the symmetric distribution of parental histones to newly synthesized daughter DNA strands, aided by histone chaperones within the DNA replication machinery. However, the mechanism of parental histone transfer remains elusive. Here, we reveal that in fission yeast, the replisome protein Mrc1 plays a crucial role in promoting the transfer of parental histone H3-H4 to the lagging strand, ensuring proper heterochromatin inheritance. In addition, Mrc1 facilitates the interaction between Mcm2 and DNA polymerase alpha, two histone-binding proteins critical for parental histone transfer. Furthermore, Mrc1's involvement in parental histone transfer and epigenetic inheritance is independent of its known functions in DNA replication checkpoint activation and replisome speed control. Instead, Mrc1 interacts with Mcm2 outside of its histone-binding region, creating a physical barrier to separate parental histone transfer pathways. These findings unveil Mrc1 as a key player within the replisome, coordinating parental histone segregation to regulate epigenetic inheritance.",

        "Abstract": "The conversion of DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by TET enzymes represents a significant epigenetic modification, yet its role in early human embryos remains largely unknown. Here we showed that the early human embryo inherited a significant amount of 5hmCs from an oocyte, which unexpectedly underwent de novo hydroxymethylation during its growth. Furthermore, the generation of 5hmC in the paternal genome after fertilization roughly followed the maternal pattern, which was linked to DNA methylation dynamics and regions of sustained methylation. The 5hmCs persisted until the eight-cell stage and exhibited high enrichment at OTX2 binding sites, whereas knockdown of OTX2 in human embryos compromised the expression of early lineage genes. Specifically, the depletion of 5hmC affected the activation of embryonic genes, which was further evaluated by ectopically expressing mouse Tet3 in human early embryos. These findings revealed distinct dynamics of 5hmC and unravelled its multifaceted functions in early human embryonic development.",

        "Abstract": "People preferentially endorse positive personality traits as more self-descriptive than negative ones, a positivity self-referential bias. Here, we investigated how to enhance positive self-referential processing, integrating wakeful cue-approach training task (CAT) and sleep-based targeted memory reactivation (TMR). In the CAT, participants gave speeded motor responses to cued positive personality traits. In a subsequent nap, we unobtrusively re-played half of the trained positive traits during slow-wave sleep (TMR). Upon awakening, CAT+TMR facilitated participants' speed in endorsing positive traits in immediate tests, and rendered participants endorse more positive traits as self-descriptive after one week. Notably, these enhancements were associated with the directionality of cue-related 1-4\u00a0Hz slow traveling waves (STW) that propagate across brain regions. Specifically, anterior-to-posterior backward STW was positively associated with these benefits, whereas forward STW showed negative associations. These findings demonstrate the potential benefits of integrated wakeful cue-approach training and sleep-based memory reactivation in strengthening positive self-referential processing.",

Attributed to the formation of a staggered type II heterostructure between KZ3TTz and Cu: ZIF-8 semiconductors, the Cu: ZIF-8/KZ3TTz heterojunction exhibited stable and significant cathode PEC response. Impressively, selective MIP film was grown on the surface of Cu: ZIF-8/KZ3TTz/GCE by electro-polymerization of 2,2-Dimethyl-5-(3-thienyl)-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (DTDD) in the presence of E. coli. After removing E. coli, more electrons were transferred to the electrolyte solution through the imprinting cavity on the MIP film, which was eliminated by O",

Here we show that a majority of differentially hemi-methylated regions (DHMRs) in liver tumor DNA or plasma cells free (cf) DNA do not overlap with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of the same samples, indicating that DHMRs could serve as independent biomarkers. Furthermore, we analyzed the cfDNA methylomes of 215 samples from individuals with liver or brain cancer and individuals without cancer (controls), and trained machine learning models using DMRs, DHMRs or both. The models incorporated with both DMRs and DHMRs show a superior performance compared to models trained with DMRs or DHMRs, with AUROC being 0.978, 0.990, and 0.983 in distinguishing control, liver and brain cancer, respectively, in a validation cohort. This study supports the potential of utilizing both DMRs and DHMRs for multi-cancer detection.",

The pulmonary vein potential plays a vital role in atrial fibrillation, and catheter ablation to isolate the pulmonary vein is crucial for treating this condition. However, when anomalous pulmonary venous return is present, it makes ablation more challenging and increases the risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence after the procedure.",

        "Title": "Adipose-derived stem cell exosomes loaded with icariin alleviates rheumatoid arthritis by modulating macrophage polarization in rats.",
        "Abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease marked by synovitis and cartilage destruction. The active compound, icariin (ICA), derived from the herb Epimedium, exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties. However, its clinical utility is limited by its water insolubility, poor permeability, and low bioavailability. To address these challenges, we developed a multifunctional drug delivery system-adipose-derived stem cells-exosomes (ADSCs-EXO)-ICA to target active macrophages in synovial tissue and modulate macrophage polarization from M1 to M2. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis confirmed a 92.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.008% loading efficiency for ADSCs-EXO-ICA. In vitro studies utilizing cellular immunofluorescence (IF) and flow cytometry demonstrated significant inhibition of M1 macrophage proliferation by ADSCs-EXO-ICA. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, cellular transcriptomics, and real-time quantitative PCR indicated that ADSCs-EXO-ICA promotes an M1-to-M2 phenotypic transition by reducing glycolysis through the inhibition of the ERK/HIF-1\u03b1/GLUT1 pathway. In vivo, ADSCs-EXO-ICA effectively accumulated in the joints. Pharmacodynamic assessments revealed that ADSCs-EXO-ICA decreased cytokine levels and mitigated arthritis symptoms in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats. Histological analysis and micro computed tomography confirmed that ADSCs-EXO-ICA markedly ameliorated synovitis and preserved cartilage. Further in vivo studies indicated that ADSCs-EXO-ICA suppresses arthritis by promoting an M1-to-M2 switch and suppressing glycolysis. Western blotting supported the therapeutic efficacy of ADSCs-EXO-ICA in RA, confirming its role in modulating macrophage function through energy metabolism regulation. Thus, this study not only introduces a drug delivery system that significantly enhances the anti-RA efficacy of ADSCs-EXO-ICA but also elucidates its mechanism of action in macrophage function inhibition.",

        "Abstract": "High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies decode tremendous amounts of microbial protein-coding gene sequences. However, accurately assigning protein functions to novel gene sequences remain a challenge. To this end, we developed FunGeneTyper, an extensible framework with two new deep learning models (i.e., FunTrans and FunRep), structured databases, and supporting resources for achieving highly accurate (Accuracy\u2009>\u20090.99, F1-score\u2009>\u20090.97) and fine-grained classification of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factor genes. Using an experimentally confirmed dataset of ARGs comprising remote homologous sequences as the test set, our framework achieves by-far-the-best performance in the discovery of new ARGs from human gut (F1-score: 0.6948), wastewater (0.6072), and soil (0.5445) microbiomes, beating the state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools and sequence alignment-based (F1-score: 0.0556-0.5065) and domain-based (F1-score: 0.2630-0.5224) annotation approaches. Furthermore, our framework is implemented as a lightweight, privacy-preserving, and plug-and-play neural network module, facilitating its versatility and accessibility to developers and users worldwide. We anticipate widespread utilization of FunGeneTyper (https://github.com/emblab-westlake/FunGeneTyper) for precise classification of protein-coding gene functions and the discovery of numerous valuable enzymes. This advancement will have a significant impact on various fields, including microbiome research, biotechnology, metagenomics, and bioinformatics.",

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) refers to the loss of ovarian function in women before the age of 40 due to the depletion of follicles or decreased quality of remaining follicles, constituting a significant cause of female infertility. In recent years, with the help of the rapid development in genetic sequencing technology, it has been demonstrated that genetic factors play a crucial role in the onset of POI. Among the population suffering from POI, genetic studies have revealed that genes involved in processes such as meiosis, DNA damage repair, and mitosis account for approximately 37.4% of all pathogenic and potentially pathogenic genes identified.

        "Title": "Multimodal Sensing for Depression Risk Detection: Integrating Audio, Video, and Text Data.",
        "Abstract": "Depression is a major psychological disorder with a growing impact worldwide. Traditional methods for detecting the risk of depression, predominantly reliant on psychiatric evaluations and self-assessment questionnaires, are often criticized for their inefficiency and lack of objectivity. Advancements in deep learning have paved the way for innovations in depression risk detection methods that fuse multimodal data. This paper introduces a novel framework, the Audio, Video, and Text Fusion-Three Branch Network (AVTF-TBN), designed to amalgamate auditory, visual, and textual cues for a comprehensive analysis of depression risk. Our approach encompasses three dedicated branches-Audio Branch, Video Branch, and Text Branch-each responsible for extracting salient features from the corresponding modality. These features are subsequently fused through a multimodal fusion (MMF) module, yielding a robust feature vector that feeds into a predictive modeling layer. To further our research, we devised an emotion elicitation paradigm based on two distinct tasks-reading and interviewing-implemented to gather a rich, sensor-based depression risk detection dataset. The sensory equipment, such as cameras, captures subtle facial expressions and vocal characteristics essential for our analysis. The research thoroughly investigates the data generated by varying emotional stimuli and evaluates the contribution of different tasks to emotion evocation. During the experiment, the AVTF-TBN model has the best performance when the data from the two tasks are simultaneously used for detection, where the F1 Score is 0.78, Precision is 0.76, and Recall is 0.81. Our experimental results confirm the validity of the paradigm and demonstrate the efficacy of the AVTF-TBN model in detecting depression risk, showcasing the crucial role of sensor-based data in mental health detection.",

        "Title": "Adipose-derived stem cell exosomes loaded with icariin attenuated M1 polarization of macrophages via inhibiting the TLR4/Myd88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.",
        "Abstract": "Abnormal macrophage polarization is one of the common pathological bases of various inflammatory diseases. The current research focus involves targeting macrophages to remodel their phenotype as a treatment approach for inflammatory diseases. Notably, exosomes can be delivered to specific types of cells or tissues or inflammatory area to realize targeted drug delivery. Although icariin (ICA) exhibits regulatory potential in macrophage polarization, the practical application of ICA is impeded by its water insolubility, poor permeability, and low bioavailability. Exploiting the inherent advantages of exosomes as natural drug carriers, we introduce a novel drug delivery system-adipose-derived stem cells-exosomes (ADSCs-EXO)-ICA. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis confirmed a loading rate of 92.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0% for ADSCs-EXO-ICA, indicating the successful incorporation of ICA. As demonstrated by cell counting kit-8 assays, ADSCs-EXO exerted a significantly higher promotion effect on macrophage proliferation. The subsequent experimental results revealed the superior anti-inflammatory effect of ADSCs-EXO-ICA compared to individual treatments with EXO or ICA in the lipopolysaccharide\u00a0+\u00a0interferon-gamma-induced M1 inflammation model. Additionally, results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blot analyses revealed that ADSCs-EXO-ICA effectively inhibited macrophage polarization toward the M1-type and concurrently promoted polarization toward the M2-type. The underlying mechanism involved the modulation of macrophage polarization through inhibition of the Toll-like receptor 4/myeloid differentiation factor 88/nuclear transcription factor-kappa B signaling pathway, thereby mitigating inflammation. These findings underscore the potential therapeutic value of ADSCs-EXO-ICA as a novel intervention for inflammatory diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Inheritance of epigenetic information is critical for maintaining cell identity. The transfer of parental histone H3-H4 tetramers, the primary carrier of epigenetic modifications on histone proteins, represents a crucial yet poorly understood step in the inheritance of epigenetic information. Here, we show the lagging strand DNA polymerase, Pol \u03b4, interacts directly with H3-H4 and that the interaction between Pol \u03b4 and the sliding clamp PCNA regulates parental histone transfer to lagging strands, most likely independent of their roles in DNA synthesis. When combined, mutations at Pol \u03b4 and Mcm2 that compromise parental histone transfer result in a greater reduction in nucleosome occupancy at nascent chromatin than mutations in either alone. Last, PCNA contributes to nucleosome positioning on nascent chromatin. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the PCNA-Pol \u03b4 complex couples lagging strand DNA synthesis to parental H3-H4 transfer, facilitating epigenetic inheritance.",

        "Abstract": "EEG neurofeedback using frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) has been widely used for emotion regulation, but its effectiveness is controversial. Studies indicated that individual differences in neurofeedback training can be traced to neuroanatomical and neurofunctional features. However, they only focused on regional brain structure or function and overlooked possible neural correlates of the brain network. Besides, no neuroimaging predictors for FAA neurofeedback protocol have been reported so far. We designed a single-blind pseudo-controlled FAA neurofeedback experiment and collected multimodal neuroimaging data from healthy participants before training. We assessed the learning performance for evoked EEG modulations during training (L1) and at rest (L2), and investigated performance-related predictors based on a combined analysis of multimodal brain networks and graph-theoretical features. The main findings of this study are described below. First, both real and sham groups could increase their FAA during training, but only the real group showed a significant increase in FAA at rest. Second, the predictors during training blocks and at rests were different: L1 was correlated with the graph-theoretical metrics (clustering coefficient and local efficiency) of the right hemispheric gray matter and functional networks, while L2 was correlated with the graph-theoretical metrics (local and global efficiency) of the whole-brain and left the hemispheric functional network. Therefore, the individual differences in FAA neurofeedback learning could be explained by individual variations in structural/functional architecture, and the correlated graph-theoretical metrics of learning performance indices showed different laterality of hemispheric networks. These results provided insight into the neural correlates of inter-individual differences in neurofeedback learning.",

        "Abstract": "The intricate relationship between prestimulus alpha oscillations and visual contrast detection variability has been the focus of numerous studies. However, the causal impact of prestimulus alpha traveling waves on visual contrast detection remains largely unexplored. In our research, we sought to discern the causal link between prestimulus alpha traveling waves and visual contrast detection across different levels of mental fatigue. Using electroencephalography alongside a visual detection task with 30 healthy adults (13 females; 17 males), we identified a robust negative correlation between prestimulus alpha forward traveling waves (FTWs) and visual contrast threshold (VCT). Inspired by this correlation, we utilized 45/-45\u00b0 phase-shifted transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in a sham-controlled, double-blind, within-subject experiment with 33 healthy adults (23 females; 10 males) to directly modulate these alpha traveling waves. After the application of 45\u00b0 phase-shifted tACS, we observed a substantial decrease in FTW and an increase in backward traveling waves, along with a concurrent increase in VCT, compared with the sham condition. These changes were particularly pronounced under a low fatigue state. The findings of state-dependent tACS effects reveal the potential causal role of prestimulus alpha traveling waves in visual contrast detection. Moreover, our study highlights the potential of 45/-45\u00b0 phase-shifted tACS in cognitive modulation and therapeutic applications.",

        "Abstract": "The presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soils has received extensive attention regarding its impacts on environmental, animal, and human systems under One Health. However, the health risks of soil ARGs and microbial determinants of soil resistomes remain poorly understood. Here, a nationwide metagenomic investigation of ARGs in cropland and forest soils in China was conducted. The findings indicated that the abundance and richness of high-risk (i.e., mobilizable, pathogen-carriable and clinically relevant) ARGs in cropland soils were 25.7 times and 8.4 times higher, respectively, compared to those identified in forest soils, suggesting the contribution of agricultural practices to the elevated risk level of soil resistomes. The biosynthetic potential of antibacterials best explained the total ARG abundance (Mantel's r\u00a0=\u00a00.52, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) when compared with environmental variables and anthropogenic disturbance. Both microbial producers' self-resistance and antagonistic interactions contributed to the ARG abundance, of which self-resistance ARGs account for 14.1\u00a0%-\u00a035.1\u00a0% in abundance. With the increased biosynthetic potential of antibacterials, the antagonistic interactions within the microbial community were greatly enhanced, leading to a significant increase in ARG abundance. Overall, these findings advance our understanding of the emergence and dissemination of soil ARGs and provide critical implications for the risk control of soil resistomes.",

        "Abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) severely affects women's fertility and accompanies serious metabolic disturbances, affecting 5%-20% of women of reproductive age globally. We previously found that exposure to toxic metals in the blood raised the risk of PCOS, but the association between exposure to toxic metals and the risk of PCOS in the follicular fluid, the microenvironment for oocyte growth and development in females, and its effect on metabolism has not been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the associations between the concentrations of cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), barium (Ba) and arsenic (As) in FF and the risk of PCOS, and to explore the mediating effect of metabolic markers in FF on the above relationship. We conducted\u00a0a case-control study, including 557 women with PCOS and 651 controls. Ba, Cd, Hg and As levels in FF were measured by ICP-MS, metabolites levels in FF was measured by LC-MS/MS among 168 participants randomly selected from all the participants. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association of a single metal level with the PCOS risk, and linear regression models were used to assess the relationships of a single metal level with clinical phenotype parameters and metabolites levels. Combined effect of metals mixture levels on the risk of PCOS were assessed via weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression and bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). Medication analysis was performed to explore the role of metabolic markers on the relationship of toxic metals levels with the risk of PCOS. The exposure levels of Cd, Hg, Ba and As in FF were all positively and significantly associated with the PCOS risk (with respect to the highest vs. lowest tertile group: OR\u2009=\u20091.57, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.17\u2009~\u20092.12 for Cd, OR\u2009=\u20091.69, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.22\u2009~\u20092.34 for Hg, OR\u2009=\u20091.76, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.32\u2009~\u20092.34 for Ba, OR\u2009=\u20091.42, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.05\u2009~\u20091.91 for As). In addition, levels of metal mixture also significantly correlated with the risk of PCOS, Cd level contributed most to it. Moreover, we observed significant positive relationships between Cd level and LH (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.048, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.002\u2009~\u20090.094), T (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.077, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.029\u2009~\u20090.125) and HOMA-IR value (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.060, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.012\u2009~\u20090.107), as well as Hg level with LH, FSH/LH ratio and TC. Furthermore, we revealed that estrone sulfate, LysoPE 22:6 and N-Undecanoylglycine were significantly and positively mediating the association between Cd level and the risk of PCOS (with mediated proportion of 0.39, 0.24 and 0.35, respectively), and between Hg level and the risk of PCOS (with mediated proportion of 0.29, 0.20 and 0.46, respectively). These highly expressed metabolites significantly enriched in the fatty acid oxidation, steroid hormone biosynthesis and glycerophospholipids metabolism, which may explain the reason why the levels of Cd and Hg in FF associated with the phenotype of PCOS. Ba and As in FF was not found the above phenomenon. Our results suggested that exposure to multiple toxic metals (Cd, Hg, Ba and As) in FF associated with the increased risk of PCOS, Cd was a major contributor. Levels of Cd and Hg in FF significantly associated with the phenotype of PCOS. The above association may result from that Cd and Hg in FF related with the disturbance of fatty acid oxidation, steroid hormone biosynthesis and the glycerophospholipids metabolism.",

Using a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% phosphoric acid and acetonitrile in a volume ratio of 98:2, the detection was performed at a wavelength of 210 nm for 15 min. In addition, a cluster analysis was performed on the detected LMWOAs in the reclaimed soil. The correlations between the LMWOA and nutrient contents in the reclaimed soil were also analyzed. In total, eight and seven LMWOAs were detected in the reclaimed soil and filled fly ash, respectively. In contrast, no LMWOAs were detected in the fresh fly ash from a thermal power plant. The order of total LMWOA contents at different sampling points followed the order of farmland control soil > 1# (",

        "Abstract": "Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) H3K27-altered is one of the most malignant childhood cancers. Radiation therapy remains the only effective treatment yet provides a 5-year survival rate of only 1%. Several clinical trials have attempted to enhance radiation antitumor activity using radiosensitizing agents, although none have been successful. Given this, there is a critical need for identifying effective therapeutics to enhance radiation sensitivity for the treatment of DMG. Using high-throughput radiosensitivity screening, we identified bromo- and extraterminal domain (BET) protein inhibitors as potent radiosensitizers in DMG cells. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of BET bromodomain activity reduced DMG cell proliferation and enhanced radiation-induced DNA damage by inhibiting DNA repair pathways. RNA-Seq and the CUT&RUN (cleavage under targets and release using nuclease) analysis showed that BET bromodomain inhibitors regulated the expression of DNA repair genes mediated by H3K27 acetylation at enhancers. BET bromodomain inhibitors enhanced DMG radiation response in patient-derived xenografts as well as genetically engineered mouse models. Together, our results highlight BET bromodomain inhibitors as potential radiosensitizer and provide a rationale for developing combination therapy with radiation for the treatment of DMG.",

        "Abstract": "High-grade gliomas (HGG) are deadly diseases for both adult and pediatric patients. Recently, it has been shown that neuronal activity promotes progression of multiple subgroups of HGG. However, epigenetic mechanisms that govern this process remain elusive. Here we report that the chromatin remodeler CHD2 regulates neuron-glioma interactions in diffuse midline glioma (DMG) characterized by onco-histone H3.1K27M. Depletion of CHD2 in H3.1K27M DMG cells compromises cell viability and neuron-to-glioma synaptic connections in vitro, neuron-induced proliferation of H3.1K27M DMG cells in vitro and in vivo, activity-dependent calcium transients in vivo, and extends the survival of H3.1K27M DMG-bearing mice. Mechanistically, CHD2 coordinates with the transcription factor FOSL1 to control the expression of axon-guidance and synaptic genes in H3.1K27M DMG cells. Together, our study reveals a mechanism whereby CHD2 controls the intrinsic gene program of the H3.1K27M DMG subtype, which in turn regulates the tumor growth-promoting interactions of glioma cells with neurons.",

        "Abstract": "Probe-based confocal laser endoscopy (pCLE) has emerged as a powerful tool for disease diagnosis, yet it faces challenges such as the formation of hexagonal patterns in images due to the inherent characteristics of fiber bundles. Recent advancements in deep learning offer promise in image denoising, but the acquisition of clean-noisy image pairs for training networks across all potential scenarios can be prohibitively costly. Few studies have explored training denoising networks on such pairs. Here, we propose an innovative self-supervised denoising method. Our approach integrates noise prediction networks, image quality assessment networks, and denoising networks in a collaborative, jointly trained manner. Compared to prior self-supervised denoising methods, our approach yields superior results on pCLE images and fluorescence microscopy images. In summary, our novel self-supervised denoising technique enhances image quality in pCLE diagnosis by leveraging the synergy of noise prediction, image quality assessment, and denoising networks, surpassing previous methods on both pCLE and fluorescence microscopy images.",

        "Abstract": "Grain size and weight are crucial yield-related traits in rice (Oryza sativa). Although certain key genes associated with rice grain size and weight have been successfully cloned, the molecular mechanisms underlying grain size and weight regulation remain elusive. Here, we identified a molecular pathway regulating grain size and weight in rice involving the MPS ONE BINDER KINASE ACTIVATOR-LIKE 1A-SERINE/THREONINE-PROTEIN KINASE 38-CYCLIN C (OsMOB1A-OsSTK38-OsCycC) module. OsSTK38 is a nuclear Dbf2-related kinase that positively regulates grain size and weight by coordinating cell proliferation and expansion in the spikelet hull. OsMOB1A interacts with and enhances the autophosphorylation of OsSTK38. Specifically, the critical role of the OsSTK38 S322 site in its kinase activity is highlighted. Furthermore, OsCycC, a component of the Mediator complex, was identified as a substrate of OsSTK38, with enhancement by OsMOB1A. Notably, OsSTK38 phosphorylates the T33 site of OsCycC. The phosphorylation of OsCycC by OsSTK38 influenced its interaction with the transcription factor KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 7 (OsKNAT7). Genetic analysis confirmed that OsMOB1A, OsSTK38, and OsCycC function in a common pathway to regulate grain size and weight. Taken together, our findings revealed a connection between the Hippo signaling pathway and the cyclin-dependent kinase module in eukaryotes. Moreover, they provide insights into the molecular mechanisms linked to yield-related traits and propose innovative breeding strategies for high-yielding varieties.",

        "Abstract": "High throughput screening (HTS) is routinely used to identify bioactive small molecules. This requires physical compounds, which limits coverage of accessible chemical space. Computational approaches combined with vast on-demand chemical libraries can access far greater chemical space, provided that the predictive accuracy is sufficient to identify useful molecules. Through the largest and most diverse virtual HTS campaign reported to date, comprising 318 individual projects, we demonstrate that our AtomNet\u00ae convolutional neural network successfully finds novel hits across every major therapeutic area and protein class. We address historical limitations of computational screening by demonstrating success for target proteins without known binders, high-quality X-ray crystal structures, or manual cherry-picking of compounds. We show that the molecules selected by the AtomNet\u00ae model are novel drug-like scaffolds rather than minor modifications to known bioactive compounds. Our empirical results suggest that computational methods can substantially replace HTS as the first step of small-molecule drug discovery.",

        "Title": "MED1 IDR acetylation reorganizes the transcription preinitiation complex, rewires 3D chromatin interactions and reprograms gene expression.",
        "Abstract": "With our current appreciation of the complexity of eukaryotic transcription, whose dysregulation drives diseases including cancer, it is becoming apparent that identification of key events coordinating multiple aspects of transcriptional regulation is of special importance. To elucidate how assembly of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) with Mediator complex preinitiation complexes (PICs) and formation of transcription-permissive 3D chromatin organization are coordinated, we studied MED1, a representative subunit of the Mediator complex that acts to establish functional preinitiation complexes (PICs) that forms biomolecular condensates through an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) to facilitate transcription, and is implicated in the function of estrogen receptor \u03b1 (hereafter ER) in ER-positive breast cancer (ER+ BC) cells. We found that MED1 is acetylated at 6 lysines in its IDR and, further, that MCF7 ER+ BC cells in which endogenous MED1 is replaced by an ectopic 6KR (non-acetylatable) mutant (6KR cells) exhibit enhanced cell growth and elevated expression of MED1-dependent genes. These results indicate an enhanced function of 6KR MED1 that may be attributed to two mechanisms: (1) reorganized PIC assembly, as indicated by increased MED1 and Pol II, decreased MED17, and equivalent ER\u03b1 occupancies on chromatin, particularly at active enhancers and promoters; (2) sub-TAD chromatin unfolding, as revealed by HiCAR (Hi-C on accessible regulatory DNA) analyses. Furthermore, in vitro assays demonstrate distinct physio-chemical properties of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) for 6KR versus 6KQ MED1 IDRs, and for non-acetylated versus CBP-acetylated WT MED1 IDR fragments. Related, Pol II CTD heptads are sequestered in 6KR and control WT MED1 IDR condensates, but not 6KQ and CBP-acetylated WT MED1 IDR condensates. These findings, in conjunction with recent reports of PIC structures, indicate that MED1 coordinates reorganization of the PIC machinery and the rewiring of regional chromatin organization through acetylation of its IDR. This study leads to an understanding of how the transition in phase behavior of a transcription cofactor acts as a mechanistic hub integrating linear and spatial chromatin functions to support gene expression, and have potential therapeutic implications for diseases involving MED1/Mediator-mediated transcription control.",

Despite decades of clinical trials, treatment remains limited to palliative radiation therapy. A major challenge is the coexistence of molecularly distinct malignant cell states with potentially orthogonal drug sensitivities. To address this challenge, we leveraged established network-based methodologies to elucidate Master Regulator (MR) proteins representing mechanistic, non-oncogene dependencies of seven coexisting subpopulations identified by single-cell analysis-whose enrichment in essential genes was validated by pooled CRISPR/Cas9 screens. Perturbational profiles of 372 clinically relevant drugs helped identify those able to invert the activity of subpopulation-specific MRs for follow-up ",

        "Abstract": "Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a pediatric tumor with dismal prognosis. Systemic strategies have been unsuccessful and radiotherapy (RT) remains the standard-of-care. A central impediment to treatment is the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which precludes drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS). Focused ultrasound (FUS) with microbubbles can transiently and non-invasively disrupt the BBB to enhance drug delivery. This study aimed to determine the feasibility of brainstem FUS in combination with clinical doses of RT. We hypothesized that FUS-mediated BBB-opening (BBBO) is safe and feasible with 39\u00a0Gy RT.",

        "Abstract": "YEATS domain-containing protein GAS41 is a histone reader and oncogene. Here, through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screenings, we identify GAS41 as a repressor of ferroptosis. GAS41 interacts with NRF2 and is critical for NRF2 to activate its targets such as SLC7A11 for modulating ferroptosis. By recognizing the H3K27-acetylation (H3K27-ac) marker, GAS41 is recruited to the SLC7A11 promoter, independent of NRF2 binding. By bridging the interaction between NRF2 and the H3K27-ac marker, GAS41 acts as an anchor for NRF2 on chromatin in a promoter-specific manner for transcriptional activation. Moreover, the GAS41-mediated effect on ferroptosis contributes to its oncogenic role in vivo. These data demonstrate that GAS41 is a target for modulating tumor growth through ferroptosis. Our study reveals a mechanism for GAS41-mediated regulation in transcription by anchoring NRF2 on chromatin, and provides a model in which the DNA binding activity on chromatin by transcriptional factors (NRF2) can be directly regulated by histone markers (H3K27-ac).",

        "Abstract": "Chromatin-based epigenetic memory relies on the accurate distribution of parental histone H3-H4 tetramers to newly replicated DNA strands. Mcm2, a subunit of the replicative helicase, and Dpb3/4, subunits of DNA polymerase \u03b5, govern parental histone H3-H4 deposition to the lagging and leading strands, respectively. However, their contribution to epigenetic inheritance remains controversial. Here, using fission yeast heterochromatin inheritance systems that eliminate interference from initiation pathways, we show that a Mcm2 histone binding mutation severely disrupts heterochromatin inheritance, while mutations in Dpb3/4 cause only moderate defects. Surprisingly, simultaneous mutations of Mcm2 and Dpb3/4 stabilize heterochromatin inheritance. eSPAN (enrichment and sequencing of protein-associated nascent DNA) analyses confirmed the conservation of Mcm2 and Dpb3/4 functions in parental histone H3-H4 segregation, with their combined absence showing a more symmetric distribution of parental histone H3-H4 than either single mutation alone. Furthermore, the FACT histone chaperone regulates parental histone transfer to both strands and collaborates with Mcm2 and Dpb3/4 to maintain parental histone H3-H4 density and faithful heterochromatin inheritance. These results underscore the importance of both symmetric distribution of parental histones and their density at daughter strands for epigenetic inheritance and unveil distinctive properties of parental histone chaperones during DNA replication.",

        "Abstract": "This study investigated the impacts of light irradiation and polymer types on the leaching behavior of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from microplastics (MPs) in freshwater. Polypropylene had the highest leaching capacity of DOM after photoaging, followed by polystyrene (PS), polyamide (PA) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). While similarly low levels of DOM were observed in the remaining 5 MP suspensions under UV irradiation and in almost all MP suspensions (except PA) under darkness. These suggest that the photooxidation of some buoyant plastics may influence the carbon cycling of nature waters. Among 9 MP-derived leachates, PET leachates had the highest chromophoric DOM concentration and aromaticity, probably owing to the special benzene rings and carbonyl groups in PET structures and its fast degradation rate. Protein-like substances were the primary fluorescent DOM in MP suspensions (except PS), especially in darkness no other fluorescent substances were found. Considering the bio-labile properties of proteins together, MPs regardless of floating or suspended in an aquatic environment may have prevalent long-term effects on microbial activities. Besides, from monomers to hexamers with newly formed chemical bonds were identified in UV-irradiated MP suspensions. These results will contribute to a deep insight into the potential ecological effects related to MP degradation.",

        "Abstract": "Bacterial secondary metabolites serve as an important source of molecules for drug discovery. They also play an important function in mediating the interactions of microbial producers with their living environment and surrounding organisms. However, little is known about the genetic novelty, distribution, and community-level impacts of soil bacterial biosynthetic potential on a large geographic scale. Here, we constructed the first catalog of 11,149 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from agricultural soils across China and unearthed hidden biosynthetic potential for new natural product discovery from the not-yet-cultivated soil bacteria. Notably, we revealed soil pH as the strongest environmental driver of BGC biogeography and predicted that soil acidification and global climate change could damage the biosynthetic potential of the soil microbiome. The co-occurrence network of bacterial genomes revealed two BGC-rich species, i.e., ",

        "Abstract": "Phenols are versatile synthetic intermediates and key structural motifs in many natural products and biologically active compounds. We herein report a visible-light-induced aerobic oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids/pinacol esters using air as oxidant and without using any catalysts and base, etc., additives, providing a green entry to a variety of phenols in a highly efficient and concise fashion. This novel reaction is enabled by photoactivation of an electron donor-acceptor complex, in which THF serves as both the solvent and electron donor. DFT studies indicated that the oxidation process involves a concerted hydrogen abstraction transfer from THF and dehydroxylation of boronic acid undergoing spin crossover from triplet to singlet to produce an active peroxoboronic acid intermidiate. Salient merits of this chemistry include broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance, gram-scale synthesis, and versatile late-stage functionalizations as well as the use of air, visible light, and catalyst- and additive-free conditions. This strategy introduces a novel photoreaction mode with the aid of a solvent, offering a succinct and environmentally sustainable route for synthesizing phenols. The strong practicability and highly efficient access to modifying complex biorelevant molecules bode well for the potential applications of this chemistry in pharmaceutical chemistry.",

        "Abstract": "Neuroimaging studies increasingly use naturalistic stimuli like video clips to trigger complex brain activations, but the complexity of such stimuli makes it difficult to assign specific functions to the resulting brain activations, particularly for higher-level content like social interactions. To address this challenge, researchers have turned to deep neural networks, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs have shown success in image recognition due to their different levels of features enabling high performance. In this study, we used pre-trained VGG-16, a popular CNN model, to analyze video data and extract hierarchical features from low-level shallow layers to high-level deeper layers, linking these activations to different levels of activation of the human brain. We hypothesized that activations in different layers of VGG-16 would be associated with different levels of brain activation and visual processing hierarchy in the brain. We were also curious about which brain regions would be associated with deeper convolutional layers in VGG-16. The study analyzed a functional MRI (fMRI) dataset where participants watched the cartoon movie Partly Cloudy. Frames of the videos were fed into VGG-16, and activation maps from different kernels and layers were extracted. Time series of the average activation patterns for each kernel were created and fed into a voxel-wise model to study brain activations. Results showed that lower convolutional layers (1",

        "Abstract": "Although the role of ferroptosis in killing tumor cells is well established, recent studies indicate that ferroptosis inducers also sabotage anti-tumor immunity by killing neutrophils and thus unexpectedly stimulate tumor growth, raising a serious issue about whether ferroptosis effectively suppresses tumor development in\u00a0vivo. Through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screenings, we discover a pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 2 (PHLDA2)-mediated ferroptosis pathway that is neither ACSL4-dependent nor requires common ferroptosis inducers. PHLDA2-mediated ferroptosis acts through the peroxidation of phosphatidic acid (PA) upon high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS-induced ferroptosis is critical for tumor growth in the absence of common ferroptosis inducers; strikingly, loss of PHLDA2 abrogates ROS-induced ferroptosis and promotes tumor growth but has no obvious effect in normal tissues in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent mouse tumor models. These data demonstrate that PHLDA2-mediated PA peroxidation triggers a distinct ferroptosis response critical for tumor suppression and reveal that PHLDA2-mediated ferroptosis occurs naturally in\u00a0vivo without any treatment from ferroptosis inducers.",

Bilateral oophorectomy was used to establish an OVX menopausal model. Four groups of rats were randomly selected: Sham surgery group, OVX group, estradiol (0.018g/L) and GZLM group (20g/kg). Cardiac function was assessed using ultrasound, blood pressure was measured using the tail cuff method. The oxidase method was used to determine the total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides in serum. Direct measurement of high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein levels (LDL-C). Hematoxylin eosin staining and electron microscopy examination of myocardial structure. Microscopic CT was used to determine the bone microstructure. GZLM improved pathological cardiac changes and reduced the LVIDs, LVVols and LVVold. There was a decrease in systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and mean blood pressure in GZLM group. A decrease in serum TC and LDL-C levels was observed in the GZLM group. The BMD, BV/TV, Tb.Th, Tb.N of GZLM group raised, while Tb.SP and SMI significantly decreased or decreased. GZLM may have the effect of improving abnormal cardiac structure and function, promoting bone metabolism in OVX rats.",

        "Abstract": "Impairments in working memory (WM) are evident in both clinically diagnosed patients with mild cognitive decline and older adults at risk, as indicated by lower scores on neuropsychological tests. Examining the WM-related neural signatures in at-risk older adults becomes essential for timely intervention. WM functioning relies on dynamic brain activities, particularly within the frontoparietal system. However, it remains unclear whether the cognitive decline would be reflected in the decreased dynamic reconfiguration of brain coactivation states during WM tasks. We enrolled 47 older adults and assessed their cognitive function using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The temporal dynamics of brain coactivations during a WM task were investigated through graph-based time-frame modularity analysis. Four primary recurring states emerged: two task-positive states with positive activity in the frontoparietal system (dorsal attention and central executive); two task-negative states with positive activity in the default mode network accompanied by negative activity in the frontoparietal networks. Heightened WM load was associated with increased flexibility of the frontoparietal networks, but the cognitive decline was correlated with reduced capacity for neuroplastic changes in response to increased task demands. These findings advance our understanding of aberrant brain reconfiguration linked to cognitive decline, potentially aiding early identification of at-risk individuals.",

        "Title": "Using Bayesian and weighted regression to evaluate the association of idiopathic oligoastenoteratozoospermia with seminal plasma metal mixtures.",
        "Abstract": "Idiopathic oligoastenoteratozoospermia (iOAT) affects 30% of infertile men of reproductive age. However, the associations between Cr, Fe, Cu, Se or Co levels and iOAT risk have not been determined. This research aimed to assess the associations between Cr, Fe, Cu, Se and Co levels as well as their mixtures in seminal plasma and the risk of iOAT and severe iOAT. Therefore, a case\u2012control study including 823 participants (416 iOAT patients and 407 controls) recruited from October 2021 to August 2022\u00a0at the reproductive medicine center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University was conducted in Anhui, China. The concentrations of Cr, Fe, Cu, Se and Co in seminal plasma were detected via inductively coupled plasma\u2012mass spectrometry. Binary logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between the levels of Cr, Fe, Cu, Se and Co and the risk of iOAT and severe iOAT; additionally, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regressions were performed to evaluate the joint effect of seminal plasma levels of Cr, Fe, Cu, Se and Co on the risk of iOAT and explore which elements contributed most to the relationship. We found significant associations between the concentrations of Fe, Cu and Se in seminal plasma and iOAT risk after adjusting for covariates (Fe, lowest tertile vs. second tertile: aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.86, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.31, 2.64; Cu, lowest tertile vs. second tertile: aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.95, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.37, 2.76; Se, lowest tertile vs. second tertile: aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.65, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.17, 2.35). A lower Se concentration in seminal plasma (lowest tertile vs. second tertile: aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.84, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.10, 3.10) was positively associated with the risk of severe iOAT. Additionally, we also observed an association between the concentration of Cr in seminal plasma and the risk of iOAT before adjusting for covariates (Cr, third tertile vs. lowest tertile: OR=1.44, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.02). According to the BKMR analyses, the risk of iOAT increased when the overall concentrations were less than the 25th percentile. The results from the WQS regression indicated that a negative WQS index was significantly associated with the iOAT risk, while a positive WQS index was not. Se and Fe had significant weights in the negative direction. In conclusion, lower Cu, Fe and Se levels in seminal plasma were positively associated with iOAT risk, while higher Cr levels in seminal plasma were positively associated with iOAT risk according to the single element model, and lower levels of Se were related to a greater risk of severe iOAT; when comprehensively considering all the results from BKMR and WQS regression, Fe, Se and Cr levels contributed most to this relationship.",

        "Abstract": "The separation challenge posed by propylene/propane mixtures arises from their nearly identical molecular sizes and physicochemical properties. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have demonstrated potential in addressing this challenge through the precision tailoring of pore sizes and surface chemistry. However, introducing modifications at the molecular level remains a considerable hurdle. This work presents an approach to reversibly tune the propylene/propane adsorption preference in zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) by manipulating the particle size and gas flow rate. Systematically increasing the ZIF-8 crystals from 9 to 224 \u03bcm restricts propane diffusion, thereby reversing its preferential adsorption over propylene. Furthermore, raising the gas flow rate of mixed propylene/propane shifts the rate-determining breakthrough step from thermodynamic equilibrium to kinetics, again reversing the adsorption preference in a particular ZIF-8 sample. We propose \"dynamic selectivity (",

        "Abstract": "This review provides an overview of the key role played by perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) in the protection of cardiovascular health. PVAT is a specific type of adipose tissue that wraps around blood vessels and has recently emerged as a critical factor for maintenance of vascular health. Through a profound exploration of existing research, this review sheds light on the intricate structural composition and cellular origins of PVAT, with a particular emphasis on combining its regulatory functions for vascular tone, inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial function. The review then delves into the intricate mechanisms by which PVAT exerts its protective effects, including the secretion of diverse adipokines and manipulation of the renin-angiotensin complex. The review further examines the alterations in PVAT function and phenotype observed in several cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and heart failure. Recognizing the complex interactions of PVAT with the cardiovascular system is critical for pursuing breakthrough therapeutic strategies that can target cardiovascular disease. Therefore, this review aims to augment present understanding of the protective role of PVAT in cardiovascular health, with a special emphasis on elucidating potential mechanisms and paving the way for future research directions in this evolving field.",

        "Abstract": "We aim to investigate the alterations in gray matter for subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the perspective of the human connectome. High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired from 54 patients with SCD, 95 patients with MCI, and 65 healthy controls (HC). Morphological brain networks (MBN) were constructed using similarities in the distribution of gray matter volumes between regions. The strength of morphological connections and topographic metrics derived from the graph-theoretical analysis were compared. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between the observed morphological abnormalities and disease severity. According to the results, we found a significantly decreased morphological connection between the somatomotor network and ventral attention network in SCD compared to HC and MCI compared to SCD. The graph-theoretic analysis illustrated disruptions in the whole network organization, where the normalized shortest path increased and the global efficiency (Eg) decreased in MCI compared to SCD. In addition, Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores of SCD patients had a significantly negative correlation with Eg. The primary limitations of the present study include the cross-sectional design, no enrolled AD patients, no assessment of amyloidosis, and the need for more comprehensive neuropsychological tests. Our findings indicate the abnormalities of morphological networks at early stages in the AD continuum, which could be interpreted as compensatory changes to retain a normal level of cognitive function. The present study could provide new insight into the mechanism of AD.",

However, current AST methods have limitations in throughput or cost effectiveness, and are impractical for microbial communities.

For community samples, we integrated immunomagnetic separation into the macAST (imacAST) system to specifically enrich the target cells before testing, which shortened bacterial isolation time from days to only 45 min and achieved AST of the target bacteria with a low concentration (~10",

        "Abstract": "The adsorptive separation of propylene and propane offers an energy-efficient alternative to the conventional cryogenic distillation technology. However, developing porous adsorbents with both high equilibrium and kinetic selectivity remains extremely challenging due to the similar size and physical properties of these gases. Herein, this work reports a ligand racemization strategy to construct quasi-discrete pores in MOFs for a synergistically enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic separation performance. The use of enantiopure l-malic acid versus racemic dl-malic acid as ligands afforded isoreticular Ni-based MOFs with contrasting one-dimensional channels (l-mal-MOF) and quasi-discrete cavities connected by small windows (dl-mal-MOF). The periodic pore constrictions in dl-mal-MOF significantly increased the differentiation in diffusion rates and binding energies between propylene and propane. dl-mal-MOF exhibited an exceptional propylene uptake of 1.82 mmol/g at 0.05 bar and 298 K along with an ultrahigh equilibrium-kinetic combined selectivity of 62.6. DFT calculations and MD simulations provided insights into the synergistic mechanism of preferential propylene adsorption and diffusion. Breakthrough column experiments demonstrated the excellent separation and high-purity recovery of propylene over propane on dl-mal-MOF. The robust stability and facile regeneration highlight its potential for propylene purification applications.",

Here, we describe a protocol of a CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen to identify regulators in response to different inducers of ferroptosis. We emphasize the steps of library amplification, drug treatment, high-throughput sequencing preparation, and bioinformatics analysis using model-based analysis of genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (MAGeCK). We also present a method to discover the regulators of ferroptosis and verify the potential targets efficiently.

However, there is still a great challenge in achieving a satisfactory performance.

        "Abstract": "Giant dimeric acceptor (G-Dimer) is becoming one of the most promising organic solar cell (OSC) materials because of its definite structure, long-term stability, and high efficiency. Strengthening the hetero-molecular interactions by monomer modification greatly influences the morphology and thus the device performance, but lacks investigation. Herein, two novel quinoxaline core-based G-Dimers, Dimer-QX and Dimer-2CF, are synthesized. By comparing trifluoromethyl-substituted Dimer-2CF and non-substituted Dimer-QX, the trifluoromethylation effect on the G-Dimer is investigated and revealed. The trifluoromethyl with strong electronegativity increases electrostatic potential and reduces surface energy of the G-Dimer, weakening the homo-molecular ordered packing but reinforcing the hetero-molecular interaction with the donor. The strong hetero-molecular interaction suppresses the fast assembly during the film formation, facilitating small domains with ordered molecular packing in the blend, which is a trade-off in conventional morphology control. Together with favorable vertical phase separation, efficient charge generation, and reduced bimolecular recombination are concurrently obtained. Hence, the Dimer-2CF-based OSCs obtain a cutting-edge efficiency of 19.02% with fill factor surpassing 80%, and an averaged extrapolated T",

        "Abstract": "The YOLOv4 approach has gained significant popularity in industrial object detection due to its impressive real-time processing speed and relatively favorable accuracy. However, it has been observed that YOLOv4 faces challenges in accurately detecting small objects. Its bounding box regression strategy is rigid and fails to effectively leverage the asymmetric characteristics of objects, limiting its ability to enhance object detection accuracy. This paper proposes an enhanced version of YOLOv4 called KR-AL-YOLO (keypoint regression strategy and angle loss based YOLOv4). The KR-AL-YOLO approach introduces two customized modules: an keypoint regression strategy and an angle-loss function. These modules contribute to improving the algorithm's detection accuracy by enabling more precise localization of objects. Additionally, KR-AL-YOLO adopts an improved feature fusion technique, which facilitates enhanced information flow within the network, thereby further enhancing accuracy performance. Experimental evaluations conducted on the COCO2017 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. KR-AL-YOLO achieves an average precision of 45.6%, surpassing both YOLOv4 and certain previously developed one-stage detectors. The utilization of keypoint regression strategy and the incorporation of robust feature fusion contribute to superior object detection accuracy in KR-AL-YOLO compared to YOLOv4.",

        "Abstract": "Individuals vary significantly in their pain sensitivity, with contributions from the brain, genes, and psychological factors. However, a multidimensional model integrating these factors is lacking due to their complex interactions. To address this, we measured pain sensitivity (ie, pain threshold and pain tolerance) using the cold pressor test, collected magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and genetic data, and evaluated psychological factors (ie, pain catastrophizing, pain-related fear, and pain-related anxiety) from 450 healthy participants with both sexes (160 male, 290 female). Using multimodal MRI fusion methods, we identified 2 pairs of covarying structural and functional brain patterns associated with pain threshold and tolerance, respectively. These patterns primarily involved regions related to self-awareness, sensory-discriminative, cognitive-evaluative, motion preparation and execution, and emotional aspects of pain. Notably, pain catastrophizing was negatively correlated with pain tolerance, and this relationship was mediated by the multimodal covarying brain patterns in male participants only. Furthermore, we identified an association between the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs4141964 within the fatty acid amide hydrolase gene and pain threshold, mediated by the identified multimodal covarying brain patterns across all participants. In summary, we suggested a model that integrates the brain, genes, and psychological factors to elucidate their role in shaping interindividual variations in pain sensitivity, highlighting the important contribution of the multimodal covarying brain patterns as important biological mediators in the associations between genes/psychological factors and pain sensitivity.",

There is controversy about the safety of discontinuing OACs in patients with atrial fibrillation after the blanking period due to the divergences between consensus recommendations and clinical practice.",

        "Abstract": "Oryza coarctata (2n\u2009=\u20094X\u2009=\u200948, KKLL) is an allotetraploid, undomesticated relative of rice and the only species in the genus Oryza with tolerance to high salinity and submergence. Therefore, it contains important stress and tolerance genes/factors for rice. The initial draft genome published was limited by data and technical restrictions, leading to an incomplete and highly fragmented assembly. This study reports a new, highly contiguous chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation of O. coarctata. PacBio high-quality HiFi reads generated 460 contigs with a total length of 573.4\u2009Mb and an N50 of 23.1\u2009Mb, which were assembled into scaffolds with Hi-C data, anchoring 96.99% of the assembly onto 24 chromosomes. The genome assembly comprises 45,571 genes, and repetitive content contributes 25.5% of the genome. This study provides the novel identification of the KK and LL genome types of the genus Oryza, leading to valuable insights into rice genome evolution. The chromosome-level genome assembly of O. coarctata is a valuable resource for rice research and molecular breeding.",

        "Abstract": "The effect of acidification through hydrochloric acid combined with inulin (In), and inulin/sodium alginate (In/SA) on the stability of native/thermally denatured myofibrillar proteins (MPs/TMPs) particles in an aqueous system was investigated. At the same pH, MPs-In and TMPs-In particles were smaller and had higher absolute potentials than MPs-In/SA and TMPs-In/SA particles. Additionally, the size of MPs-In particles reached 1\u00a0\u03bcm, and the solubility increased from 21.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.57\u00a0% to 76.26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.27\u00a0% when the pH was reduced from 5.0 to 3.0. The absolute potential of TMPs 3-In particles increased from 15.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.72 to 28.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.30\u00a0mV, and the solubility increased from 18.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.72\u00a0% to 74.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.74\u00a0%. Confocal laser microscopy revealed that, compared with pH\u00a05.0 or 4.0, MPs-In/TMPs-In particles dispersed more evenly at pH\u00a03.0 compared with pH\u00a05.0 or 4.0. This further confirmed that electrostatic repulsion between particles maximally contributed to particle stability. Furthermore, the \u03b1-helix content in TMPs-In particles at pH\u00a03.0 decreased from 41.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.09\u00a0% (TMPs control) to 16.61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.87\u00a0%. This decrement of an up to 60\u00a0% led to decreased intramolecular hydrogen bonds and improved surface hydrophobicity. Therefore, a single polysaccharide (In) combined with MPs/TMPs particles exhibited higher dispersion and stability at pH\u00a03.0. These findings could provide new insights into chicken-derived protein beverage processing.",

        "Abstract": "Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are promising for efficient solar energy conversion, but achieving high efficiency and device longevity within a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure remains a challenge. Traditional small-molecule acceptors (SMAs) in the BHJ blend show thermodynamic instability affecting the morphology. In contrast, tethered SMAs exhibit higher glass transition temperatures, mitigating these concerns. Yet, they might not integrate well with polymer donors, causing pronounced phase separation and overpurification of mixed domains. Herein, a novel ternary device is introduced that uses DY-P2EH, a tethered dimeric SMA with conjugated side-chains as host acceptor, and BTP-ec9, a monomeric SMA as secondary acceptor, which respectively possess hypomiscibility and hypermiscibility with the polymer donor PM6. This unique combination affords a parallel-connected ternary BHJ blend, leading to a hierarchical and stable morphology. The ternary device achieves a remarkable fill factor of 80.61% and an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.09%. Furthermore, the ternary device exhibits exceptional stability, retaining over 85% of its initial efficiency even after enduring 1100 h of thermal stress at 85\u00a0\u00b0C. These findings highlight the potential advantage of tethered SMAs in the design of ternary devices with a refined hierarchical structure for more efficient and durable solar energy conversion technologies.",

At 90\u00a0K above T_{C}, a strong, unanticipated preference for propagation along the substrate [001] azimuth suddenly emerges, which is attributed to presolidification at the liquid-solid interface.

        "Abstract": "Telomere attrition plays a critical role in the reproductive aging process in humans. Telomere length (TL) is typically regulated by telomerase, the main component of which is telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes of relative TL (RTL) and TERT expression in granulosa cells (GCs) during aging and its association with reproduction. Clinical data on the frozen\u2011thawed embryo transfer cycles of older (>35\u00a0year old) and younger (\u226435\u00a0year old) women from a single center over a 3\u2011year period were retrospectively analyzed. Preimplantation genetic testing for chromosome aneuploidies in older women during the same period was also analyzed. Following the analysis of the data, several biological characteristics of senescent GCs were explored. In addition, a total of 160\u00a0women who were undergoing their \ufb01rst fresh cycle of ",

        "Abstract": "HMGB1 that belongs to the High Mobility Group-box superfamily, is a nonhistone chromatin associated transcription factor. It is present in the nucleus of eukaryotes and can be actively secreted or passively released by kinds of cells. HMGB1 is important for maintaining DNA structure by binding to DNA and histones, protecting it from damage. It also regulates the interaction between histones and DNA, affecting chromatin packaging, and can influence gene expression by promoting nucleosome sliding. And as a DAMP, HMGB1 binding to RAGE and TLRs activates NF-\u03baB, which triggers the expression of downstream genes like IL-18, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1. HMGB1 is known to be involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes. Recent studies have demonstrated the significance of HMGB1 as DAMPs in the female reproductive system. These findings have shed light on the potential role of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of diseases in female reproductive system and the possibilities of HMGB1-targeted therapies for treating them. Such therapies can help reduce inflammation and metabolic dysfunction and alleviate the symptoms of reproductive system diseases. Overall, the identification of HMGB1 as a key player in disease of the female reproductive system represents a significant breakthrough in our understanding of these conditions and presents exciting opportunities for the development of novel therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a bioactive substance with anti-inflammatory activities. Clusters of CD36 have been suggested to be widely involved in inflammatory damage. However, the mechanism of CGA protecting against LPS-induced inflammation involving the CD36 regulation is unclear. Here, we demonstrated that CGA protected against LPS-induced cell death and decreased the production of ROS. Moreover, the SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px activities were also upregulated in CGA-treated cells during LPS stimulation. CGA reduced COX-2 and iNOS expression and IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 secretion in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. In addition, CGA treatment widely involved in immune-related signaling pathways, including NF-\u03baB signaling, NOD-like receptor signaling, and IL-17 signaling using transcriptomic analysis and CD36 also markedly reduced during CGA pretreatment in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, the CD36 inhibitor SSO attenuated inflammation and oxidative stress by enabling activation of the AMPK/PGC-1\u03b1 cascade. These results indicate that CGA might provide benefits for the regulation of inflammatory diseases by modulating CD36/AMPK/PGC-1\u03b1 to alleviate oxidative stress.",

Yet direct knowledge about CAF-1's histone binding mode and nucleosome assembly process is lacking. In this work, we report the crystal structure of human CAF-1 in the absence of histones and the cryo-electron microscopy structure of CAF-1 in complex with histones H3 and H4. One histone H3-H4 heterodimer is bound by one CAF-1 complex mainly through the p60 subunit and the acidic domain of the p150 subunit. We also observed a dimeric CAF-1-H3-H4 supercomplex in which two H3-H4 heterodimers are poised for tetramer assembly and discovered that CAF-1 facilitates right-handed DNA wrapping of H3-H4 tetramers. These findings signify the involvement of DNA in H3-H4 tetramer formation and suggest a right-handed nucleosome precursor in chromatin replication.",

        "Abstract": "For over two decades, most high-performance organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have been made with donor:acceptor bulk heterojunctions with domain sizes limited by exciton diffusion, where charge separation mostly takes place through the dissociation of the interfacial charge-transfer (xCT) excitons. Recently, nonfullerene acceptor (NFA)-based OPVs have shown excellent compatibility to device structures with large domains in active layers. However, it remains elusive how the excitations that are distant from the interfaces are converted into free charges. Here, we report the identification of a new charge separation channel in model copolymer/NFA blends mediated by intra-moiety delocalized excitations in both planar heterojunctions and donor-enriched bulk heterojunctions. The delocalized excitations induced by interchromophore electronic interactions in copolymer donors mediate the long-range charge separation and dissociate into free charges without forming the bound xCT states first, releasing the constraints associated with the short exciton diffusion length in organic materials. The long-range charge separation mechanism uncovered in this work, in cooperation with the short-range xCT-mediated pathway, holds the potential to further optimize OPVs with diverse device structures.",

        "Abstract": "Modifications of plant architecture can increase planting density, regulate photosynthesis, and improve crop yields. Many basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors participate in the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway and are critical for plant architecture morphogenesis in rice. However, the number of identified bHLH genes suitable for improving production value is still limited. In this study, we cloned Lam1, encoding the typical bHLH transcription factor OsbHLH92. OsbHLH92 knockout (KO) lines exhibit erect leaves. Decreases in the number and size of parenchyma cell layers on the adaxial side of the lamina joint in KO lines were the main reason for the decreased leaf angle. Genetic experiments verify that OsBU1 and its homologs are downstream of OsbHLH92, which is involved in the noncanonical RGA1-mediated BR signaling pathway. OsbHLH91, an OsbHLH92 homolog, plays both conserved and differentiated roles relative to OsbHLH92. Notably, OsbHLH92-KO lines show erect leaves without the acquisition of adverse agronomic traits. Moreover, by driving a specific panicle promoter, OsbHLH92 can greatly increase productivity by at least 10%. This study identifies new components of the BR signaling pathway, demonstrates the importance of OsbHLH92 in improving planting density and crop productivity, and broadens our knowledge of typical and atypical bHLH family members in rice.",

The rotation of cells plays a significant role in their swimming patterns, such as in sperm cells. We proposed a fast deep-learning-based method that can automatically determine the projection orientation of ellipsoidal-like cells without additional optical design. This method was utilized for analyzing the planar rotation of trapped sperm cells using an optical tweezer, demonstrating its feasibility in extracting the rotation of the cell head. Furthermore, we employed this method to investigate sperm cell activity by examining variations in sperm rotation rates under different conditions, including temperature and laser output power. Our findings provide evidence for the effectiveness of this method and the rotation analysis method developed may have clinical potential for sperm quality evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "Numerous studies of perceptual decision-making have shown that lower prestimulus alpha power leads to a higher hit rate in visual detection, which is believed to correlate with the top-down control. However, whether frontal-occipital phase synchronization underlying the top-down control could impact the occipital alpha power that directly affects the perceptual performance remains unclear. In this study, we used analyses of the general linear mixed model (GLMM) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to show that the prestimulus alpha power over the occipital area directly affected visual perception. Using both the univariate and multivariate methods, we found that low-frequency (4-30\u00a0Hz) frontal-occipital phase synchronization predicted the prestimulus alpha power over the occipital area. Overall, our results suggested that frontal-occipital phase synchronization could predict occipital alpha power that directly affects perceptual decision-making.",

        "Abstract": "Here, we identified vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 like 1 (VKORC1L1) as a potent ferroptosis repressor. VKORC1L1 protects cells from ferroptosis by generating the reduced form of vitamin K, a potent radical-trapping antioxidant, to counteract phospholipid peroxides independent of the canonical GSH/GPX4 mechanism. Notably, we found that VKORC1L1 is also a direct transcriptional target of p53. Activation of p53 induces downregulation of VKORC1L1 expression, thus sensitizing cells to ferroptosis for tumor suppression. Interestingly, a small molecular inhibitor of VKORC1L1, warfarin, is widely prescribed as an FDA-approved anticoagulant drug. Moreover, warfarin represses tumor growth by promoting ferroptosis in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent mouse models. Thus, by downregulating VKORC1L1, p53 executes the tumor suppression function by activating an important ferroptosis pathway involved in vitamin K metabolism. Our study also reveals that warfarin is a potential repurposing drug in cancer therapy, particularly for tumors with high levels of VKORC1L1 expression.",

People from countries without a well-developed health safety-net are particularly vulnerable. Existing literature on rare diseases in China focuses on the unmet needs for care of the patients and the difficulties of caregivers and physicians. Very few studies examine the state of social safety-net, the unresolved issues and whether the current localized arrangements are sufficient. This study aimed to gain in-depth knowledge of the current policy system and make sense of the local varieties, which would be essential for developing strategies for future policy changes.",

Giant molecule acceptors (GMAs) bearing SMAs as subunits offer a solution to this issue, while their classical synthesis via the Stille coupling suffers from low reaction efficiency and difficulty in obtaining mono-brominated SMA, rendering the approach impractical for their large-scale and low-cost preparation. In this study, we present a simple and cost-effective solution to this challenge through Lewis acid-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation with boron trifluoride etherate (BF",

Currently, the mandibular advancement device (MAD) is the preferred product for the treatment of mild to moderate OSAS because of its compliance, portability and low cost. However, many clinical studies have suggested that long-term use of MAD might cause occlusal changes, periodontitis, muscle soreness, and joint damage. In view of the difficulties in the measurement of relevant mechanical factors in vivo, the present work aimed to quantitatively analyze biomechanical mechanisms that might lead to these side effects through computer numerical simulations and a nonhomogeneous alveolar bone model was established to approximate the actual bony features of the jaw in the simulations model. First, a 3D digital model of the teeth, periodontal ligament(PDL), and alveolar bone was created on the basis of computed tomography images and assembled with a 3D model of the MAD. A nonhomogeneous alveolar bone model was created based on computed tomographic images, and the stresses acting on the PDL were computed using the finite element method. The results showed that the nonhomogeneous model could more realistically reflect the mechanical properties of the alveolar bone and obtain the true stresses compared with the homogeneous model, which underestimated the adverse effects of PDL therapy. The numerical simulations in this paper can help doctors make more accurate judgements about MAD treatment from an oral health protection perspective.",

        "Title": "Human 8-cell embryos enable efficient induction of disease-preventive mutations without off-target effect by cytosine base editor.",
        "Abstract": "Approximately 140 million people worldwide are homozygous carriers of APOE4 (\u03b54), a strong genetic risk factor for late onset familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), 91% of whom will develop AD at earlier age than heterozygous carriers and noncarriers. Susceptibility to AD could be reduced by targeted editing of APOE4, but a technical basis for controlling the off-target effects of base editors is necessary to develop low-risk personalized gene therapies. Here, we first screened eight cytosine base editor variants at four injection stages (from 1- to 8-cell stage), and found that FNLS-YE1 variant in 8-cell embryos achieved the comparable base conversion rate (up to 100%) with the lowest bystander effects. In particular, 80% of AD-susceptible \u03b54 allele copies were converted to the AD-neutral \u03b53 allele in human \u03b54-carrying embryos. Stringent control measures combined with targeted deep sequencing, whole genome sequencing, and RNA sequencing showed no DNA or RNA off-target events in FNLS-YE1-treated human embryos or their derived stem cells. Furthermore, base editing with FNLS-YE1 showed no effects on embryo development to the blastocyst stage. Finally, we also demonstrated FNLS-YE1 could introduce known protective variants in human embryos to potentially reduce human susceptivity to systemic lupus erythematosus and familial hypercholesterolemia. Our study therefore suggests that base editing with FNLS-YE1 can efficiently and safely introduce known preventive variants in 8-cell human embryos, a potential approach for reducing human susceptibility to AD or other genetic diseases.",

        "Abstract": "With the power conversion efficiency of binary polymer solar cells dramatically improved, the thermal stability of the small-molecule acceptors raised the main concerns on the device operating stability. Here, to address this issue, thiophene-dicarboxylate spacer tethered small-molecule acceptors are designed, and their molecular geometries are further regulated via the thiophene-core isomerism engineering, affording dimeric TDY-\u03b1 with a 2, 5-substitution and TDY-\u03b2 with 3, 4-substitution on the core. It shows that TDY-\u03b1 processes a higher glass transition temperature, better crystallinity relative to its individual small-molecule acceptor segment and isomeric counterpart of TDY-\u03b2, and a more stable morphology with the polymer donor. As a result, the TDY-\u03b1 based device delivers a higher device efficiency of 18.1%, and most important, achieves an extrapolated lifetime of about 35000\u2009hours that retaining 80% of their initial efficiency. Our result suggests that with proper geometry design, the tethered small-molecule acceptors can achieve both high device efficiency and operating stability.",

        "Abstract": "The link between fatty acids and bone metabolism is complex and can be direct and indirect. This link has been reported in different types of bone cells and various stages of bone metabolism. G-protein coupled receptor 120 (GPR120), also called free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4), is a member of the recently discovered G protein-coupled receptor family that can interact with both long-chain saturated fatty acids (C14-C18) and long-chain unsaturated fatty acids (C16-C22). Research shows that GPR120 regulates processes in different types of bone cells, directly or indirectly affecting bone metabolism. Our research reviewed the literature on the effects of GPR120 on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs), osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes, focusing on the research findings regarding the mechanism by which GPR120 alters specific bone metabolic diseases-osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. The data reviewed here provide a basis for clinical and basic research into the role of GPR120 on bone metabolic diseases.",

        "Abstract": "C3 and C4 grasses directly and indirectly provide the vast majority of calories to the human diet, yet our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving photosynthetic productivity in grasses is largely unexplored. Ground meristem cells divide to form mesophyll or vascular initial cells early in leaf development in C3 and C4 grasses. Here we define a genetic circuit composed of SHORT ROOT (SHR), INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD), and PIN-FORMED (PIN) family members that specifies vascular identify and ground cell proliferation in leaves of both C3 and C4 grasses. Ectopic expression and loss-of-function mutant studies of SHR paralogs in the C3 plant Oryza sativa (rice) and the C4 plant Setaria viridis (green millet) revealed the roles of these genes in both minor vein formation and ground cell differentiation. Genetic and in vitro studies further suggested that SHR regulates this process through its interactions with IDD12 and 13. We also revealed direct interactions of these IDD proteins with a putative regulatory element within the auxin transporter gene PIN5c. Collectively, these findings indicate that a SHR-IDD regulatory circuit mediates auxin transport by negatively regulating PIN expression to modulate minor vein patterning in the grasses.",

However, they are limited by their photostability and have been less explored for photoinduced electron transfer (PET) applications. Herein we demonstrate a novel strategy to cover the shortage of aryl-ketone photocatalysts and control the photoreactivity by implanting symmetric aryl ketones into the conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs). To prove the concept, three comparative materials with the same topology and varied electronic structures were built, adopting truxenone knot and functionalized terephthalaldehyde linkers. Spectroscopic investigation and excited carrier dynamics analysis disclosed improvements in the photostability and electronic transfer efficiency as well as the structure-performance relationships toward ",

        "Abstract": "Aquaporin-8(AQP8), is a transmembrane channel protein that abounds in liver, which mainly promotes water transport, modulating bile acid formation. However, its role in hepatic lipid metabolism remains unclear. In this study, we found the expression of AQP8 was reduced in liver specimens of patients with NAFLD, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mice and genetically obese db/db mice. Knockdown of AQP8 in hepatocytes exacerbated the intracellular lipid accumulation induced by free fatty acid (FFA) mixtures. In contrast, hepatic AQP8 overexpression activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR), inhibiting gene expression associated with lipogenesis, which further reduced intrahepatic triglyceride overload in obese mice. FXR knockout abrogated the ameliorating effect of AQP8 overexpression on NAFLD in mice. These findings indicate that AQP8 overexpression protects against fatty liver through activating the FXR pathway.",

Therefore, a new strategy to combat PCa is urgently needed. Enlightened by the gain-of-function mutations of androgen insensitivity syndrome, we discovered for the first time small-molecule antagonists toward a prospective pocket on the AR dimer interface named the dimer interface pocket (DIP) via molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, structure-based virtual screening, structure-activity relationship exploration, and bioassays. The first-in-class antagonist M17-B15 targeting the DIP is capable of effectively disrupting AR self-association, thereby suppressing AR signaling. Furthermore, M17-B15 exhibits extraordinary anti-PCa efficacy in vitro and also in mouse xenograft tumor models, demonstrating that AR dimerization disruption by small molecules targeting the DIP is a novel and valid strategy against PCa.",

        "Abstract": "Risky decision-making is critical to survival and development, which has been compromised in elderly populations. However, the neural substrates of altered financial risk-taking behavior in aging are still under-investigated. Here we examined the intrinsic putamen network in modulating risk-taking behaviors of Balloon Analogue Risk Task in healthy young and older adults using resting-state fMRI. Compared with the young group, the elderly group showed significantly different task performance. Based on the task performance, older adults were further subdivided into two subgroups, showing young-like and over-conservative risk behaviors, regardless of cognitive decline. Compared with young adults, the intrinsic pattern of putamen connectivity was significantly different in over-conservative older adults, but not in young-like older adults. Notably, age-effects on risk behaviors were mediated via the putamen functional connectivity. In addition, the putamen gray matter volume showed significantly different relationships with risk behaviors and functional connectivity in over-conservative older adults. Our findings suggest that reward-based risky behaviors might be a sensitive indicator of brain aging, highlighting the critical role of the putamen network in maintaining optimal risky decision-making in age-related cognitive decline.",

        "Title": "Diosgenin reduces bone loss through the regulation of gut microbiota in ovariectomized rats.",
        "Abstract": "Diosgenin (DIO) is an aglycone of steroid saponins acquired from plants, including Dioscorea alata, Smilax China, and Trigonella foenum graecum, acting as an anti-osteoporosis, anti-diabetic, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-inflammatory. Recent studies have demonstrated that DIO reduces bone loss. This study aimed to investigate the effects of DIO on the gut microbiota (GM) of ovariectomized (OVX) osteoporotic rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham operation (sham\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle group) or ovariectomy. For 12\u00a0weeks, OVX rats were treated using a vehicle (OVX\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle group) and DIO (OVX\u00a0+\u00a0DIO group). Subsequently, ELISA was conducted to determine serum estradiol levels, micro-CT scanning was performed to evaluate bone quality, and feces were collected for metagenomics sequencing to examine the structure and function of GM. Raw reads were filtered to remove chimera sequences. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered in the filtered reads. A Venn diagram analysis was conducted to study the common and unique OTUs in the sham\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle, OVX\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle, and OVX\u00a0+\u00a0DIO groups. LEfSe analysis was conducted to evaluate the specific GM of the three groups. The GM functions were analyzed using the KEGG and CAZy databases. After a 12-week treatment, DIO administration prevented OVX-induced weight gain and increased the estradiol levels. DIO treatment improved the bone microstructure and structural parameters of rat tibias. Metagenomics sequencing results identified 1139, 1207, and 1235 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the sham\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle, OVX\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle, and OVX\u00a0+\u00a0DIO groups, respectively. The percentage of common OTUs was 41.2%. Treatment with DIO restored the composition of GM in OVX rats by increasing the abundance of Coriobacteriia Adlercreutzia, Romboutsia, and Romboutsia_idealis and reducing the abundance of Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Methanobacteria, Bacteroides, Phocaeicola, Alistipes, Bacteroids_uniformis, Bacteroids_xylanisolvens. The anti-osteoporosis effect of DIO can be regulated through environmental information processing, organismal Systems, Cellular Processes, human diseases, metabolism, and genetic information processing. Meanwhile, treatment with DIO improved GM homeostasis by increasing the metabolism of carbohydrates, other amino acids, and glycans and reducing translation, energy metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism. DIO can reduce bone loss by regulating the structural composition and function of GM, a novel strategy for preventing osteoporosis.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial diseases (MDs) are genetic and clinical heterogeneous diseases caused by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation defects. It is not only one of the most common genetic diseases, but also the only genetic disease involving two different genomes in humans. As a result of the complicated genetic condition, the pathogenesis of MDs is not entirely elucidated at present, and there is a lack of effective treatment in the clinic. Establishing the ideal animal models is the critical preclinical platform to explore the pathogenesis of MDs and to verify new therapeutic strategies. However, the development of animal modeling of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-related MDs is time-consuming due to the limitations of physiological structure and technology. A small number of animal models of mtDNA mutations have been constructed using cell hybridization and other methods. However, the diversity of mtDNA mutation sites and clinical phenotypes make establishing relevant animal models tricky. The development of gene editing technology has become a new hope for establishing animal models of mtDNA-related mitochondrial diseases.",

        "Title": "A brain-wide genome-wide association study of candidate quantitative trait loci associated with structural and functional phenotypes of pain sensitivity.",
        "Abstract": "Individual pain sensitivity is modulated by the brain's structural and functional features, but its heritability remains unclear. This paper conducted a brain-wide genome-wide association study (GWAS) to explore the genetic bases of neuroimage phenotypes of pain sensitivity. In total, 432 normal participants were divided into high and low pain sensitivity groups according to the laser quantitative test threshold. Then, the brain's gray matter density (GMD) features correlated with pain sensitivity were identified. Next, GWAS was performed on each GMD phenotype using quality-controlled genotypes. Based on the heatmap and hierarchical clustering results, the right insula was identified for further refined analysis in terms of subregions GMD and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) phenotypes. The results indicate that the right insula GMD in the high sensitivity group is significantly lower than that in the low sensitivity group. Also, the TT/TC group at locus rs187974 has lower right insula GMD than the CC group. Further, loci at gene CYP2D6 may lead to a variation of rs-FC between the right insula and left putamen. In conclusion, our study suggests that the right insula and multiple candidate loci may be importantly involved in pain sensitivity modulation, which may guide the future development of precision pain therapeutics.",

The pathogenesis of POR is related to gene variations. Our study included a Chinese family comprising two siblings with infertility born to consanguineous parents. Poor ovarian response (POR) was identified in the female patient who had multiple embryo implantation failures occurring in subsequent assisted reproductive technology cycles. Meanwhile, the male patient was diagnosed with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA).",

(2) Methods: Analysis was carried out on 5477 frozen embryo transfer cycles of women in different ages. All the cycles were divided into three groups according to the age of the included women: <35, 35-39, and >39. The live birth rate (LBR) and multiple birth rate (MBR) between the SBT and DBT among these groups, respectively, were compared. (3) Results: In the women < 35 group, the LBR was similar in SBT and DBT, but the MBR was higher in DBT than SBT. In women 35-39, with >10 oocytes retrieved, the MBR in DBT was significantly higher than SBT, but there was no significant difference in LBR between the two groups; with \u226410 oocytes retrieved, the LBR in DBT were significantly higher than SBT, but the MBT was not significantly different between the two groups. In women > 39, the LBR and MBR were lower in the SBT than DBT, but the differences were not statistically significant. (4) Conclusions: Selective SET is appropriate for most young women, whereas older women are advised to make individualized choices based on the number of oocytes retrieved and blastocyst quality.",

        "Abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the most common causes of heart failure. Therefore, screening and early diagnosis of potential DCM patients is beneficial. Electrocardiogram (ECG) can be an inexpensive and easily available screening tool. We aimed to construct a simple screening model for DCM based on electrocardiogram. In this retrospective observational study, we consecutively enrolled 117 DCM patients between July 1, 2016 and July 1, 2021 as the DCM group, while 117 patients hospitalized in the same period with normal echocardiography and ECG were selected as the non-DCM group. Patients were randomly assigned to the training and validation sets at 8:2. ECG parameters of left ventricular related leads were exacted. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate screening indicators of ECG parameters and a nomogram was conducted. The screening ability of the model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Furthermore, the nomogram was assessed using calibration curve and decision curve analysis. Screening indicators included in the nomogram were the amplitude of S wave in V1 and V3 leads, the amplitude of R wave in aVF and V6 leads, and PR interval. The nomogram performed satisfactory discrimination in the training (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.904) and validation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.878) sets and good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow P = .066). Decision curve analysis demonstrated the model can generate a net benefit of 0.33 when the threshold probability was 0.543. The nomogram based on electrocardiogram is a simple and practical screening tool for potential DCM patients.",

        "Abstract": "As a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase, p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) participates in diverse biologic events. However, its roles in mouse oocyte meiotic maturation remain unclear. The present study revealed that mouse oocytes depleted of Pak2 were unable to completely progress through meiosis and that a majority were arrested at metaphase I. Pak2 depletion thus prompted MI arrest and induced meiotic chromosome alignment defects in mouse oocytes, in part due to a reduction in polo-like kinase (PLK1). We demonstrated that PAK2's interaction with PLK1 protected it from degradation by APC/C",

        "Title": "Functional connectivity profiles of the default mode and visual networks reflect temporal accumulative effects of sustained naturalistic emotional experience.",
        "Abstract": "Determining and decoding emotional brain processes under ecologically valid conditions remains a key challenge in affective neuroscience. The current functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) based emotion decoding studies are mainly based on brief and isolated episodes of emotion induction, while sustained emotional experience in naturalistic environments that mirror daily life experiences are scarce. Here we used 12 different 10-minute movie clips as ecologically valid emotion-evoking procedures in n\u00a0=\u00a052 individuals to explore emotion-specific fMRI functional connectivity (FC) profiles on the whole-brain level at high spatial resolution (432 parcellations including cortical and subcortical structures). Employing machine-learning based decoding and cross validation procedures allowed to investigate FC profiles contributing to classification that can accurately distinguish sustained happiness and sadness and that generalize across subjects, movie clips, and parcellations. Both functional brain network-based and subnetwork-based emotion classification results suggested that emotion manifests as distributed representation of multiple networks, rather than a single functional network or subnetwork. Further, the results showed that the Visual Network (VN) and Default Mode Network (DMN) associated functional networks, especially VN-DMN, exhibited a strong contribution to emotion classification. To further estimate the temporal accumulative effect of naturalistic long-term movie-based video-evoking emotions, we divided the 10-min episode into three stages: early stimulation (1\u223c200\u00a0s), middle stimulation (201\u223c400\u00a0s), and late stimulation (401\u223c600\u00a0s) and examined the emotion classification performance at different stimulation stages. We found that the late stimulation contributes most to the classification (accuracy=85.32%, F1-score=85.62%) compared to early and middle stimulation stages, implying that continuous exposure to emotional stimulation can lead to more intense emotions and further enhance emotion-specific distinguishable representations. The present work demonstrated that sustained happiness and sadness under naturalistic conditions are presented in emotion-specific network profiles and these expressions may play different roles in the generation and modulation of emotions. These findings elucidated the importance of network level adaptations for sustained emotional experiences during naturalistic contexts and open new venues for imaging network level contributions under naturalistic conditions.",

The results of the experimental verification conducted for nine icing cycles in different years and geographic locations demonstrate that the proposed technique can effectively predict multiple types of icing while ensuring correlation coefficients >\u20050.99 and mean squared error <\u20054%.",

The absence of organometallic reagents enables the reaction to occur under mild conditions with a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. Moreover, other C-based electrophiles, including alkenyl, alkynyl and alkyl halides, or pseudohalides, were also competent substrates for this reaction.",

        "Title": "Deduplication Improves Cost-Efficiency and Yields of ",
        "Abstract": "In the last decade, metagenomics has greatly revolutionized the study of microbial communities. However, the presence of artificial duplicate reads raised mainly from the preparation of metagenomic DNA sequencing libraries and their impacts on metagenomic assembly and binning have never been brought to attention. Here, we explicitly investigated the effects of duplicate reads on metagenomic assemblies and binning based on analyses of five groups of representative metagenomes with distinct microbiome complexities. Our results showed that deduplication considerably increased the binning yields (by 3.5% to 80%) for most of the metagenomic data sets examined thanks to the improved contig length and coverage profiling of metagenome-assembled contigs, whereas it slightly decreased the binning yields of metagenomes with low complexity (e.g., human gut metagenomes). Specifically, 411 versus 397, 331 versus 317, 104 versus 88, and 9 versus 5 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered from MEGAHIT assemblies of bioreactor sludge, surface water, lake sediment, and forest soil metagenomes, respectively. Noticeably, deduplication significantly reduced the computational costs of the metagenomic assembly, including the elapsed time (9.0% to 29.9%) and the maximum memory requirement (4.3% to 37.1%). Collectively, we recommend the removal of duplicate reads in metagenomes with high complexity before assembly and binning analyses, for example, the forest soil metagenomes examined in this study. ",

However, its inherent \"volume effect\" may easily turn tin-based electrode materials into powder and make them fall off in the cycle process, eventually leading to the reduction of the specific capacity, rate and cycle performance of the batteries. Considering the \"volume effect\" of tin, this study proposes to construct a carbon coating and three-dimensional graphene network to obtain a \"double confinement\" of metal tin, so as to improve the cycle and rate performance of the composite. This excellent construction can stabilize the tin and prevent its agglomeration during heat treatment and its pulverization during cycling, improving the electrochemical properties of tin-based composites. When the optimized composite material of C@Sn/NSGr-7.5 was used as an anode material in LIB, it maintained a specific capacity of about 667 mAh g",

However, their viability is severely hampered by dendrite-related hazards on anodes. Herein, a novel ultrathin (8 \u00b5m) exterior-nonporous separator composed of honeycomb-structured fibers is prepared for homogeneous Na deposition and suppressed dendrite penetration. The unhindered ion transmission greatly benefits\u00a0from honeycomb-structured fibers with huge electrolyte uptake (376.7%) and the polymer's inherent transport ability. Additionally, polar polymer chains consisting of polyethersulfone and polyvinylidene customize the highly aggregated solvation structure of electrolytes via substantial solvent immobilization, facilitating ion-conductivity-enhanced inorganic-rich solid-electrolyte interphase with remarkable interface endurance. With the reliable mechanical strength of the\u00a0separator, the assembled sodium-ion full cell delivers significantly improved energy density and high safety,\u00a0enabling stable operation under cutting and rolling. The as-prepared separator can further be generalized to lithium-based batteries for which apparent dendrite inhibition and cyclability are accessible and demonstrates its potential for practical application.",

However, the macroscopic phosphorescence intensity covered the intrinsic effect of the environmental heavy atoms. In this study, a method of separating the external HAE from the total is performed, and a quantity to describe the intrinsic nature of external HAE is defined. The environmental Gd",

        "Abstract": "The collective oscillation of free electrons at the nanoscale surface of gold nanostructures is closely modulated by tuning the size, shape/morphology, phase, composition, hybridization, assembly, and nanopatterning, along with the surroundings of the plasmonic surface located at a dielectric interface with air, liquid, and solid. This review first introduces the physical origin of the intrinsic optical properties of gold nanostructures and further summarizes stimuli-responsive changes in optical properties, metal-field-enhanced optical signals, luminescence spectral shaping, chiroptical response, and photogenerated hot carriers. The current success in the landscape of nanoscience and nanotechnology mainly originates from the abundant optical properties of gold nanostructures in the thermodynamically stable face-centered cubic (fcc) phase. It has been further extended by crystal phase engineering to prepare thermodynamically unfavorable phases (e.g., kinetically stable) and heterophases to modulate their intriguing phase-dependent optical properties. A broad range of promising applications, including but not limited to full-color displays, solar energy harvesting, photochemical reactions, optical sensing, and microscopic/biomedical imaging, have fostered parallel research on the multitude of physical effects occurring in gold nanostructures.",

        "Abstract": "Due to the broad application of next-generation sequencing, the molecular diagnosis of genetic disorders in pediatric neurology is no longer an unachievable goal. However, treatments for neurological genetic disorders in children remain primarily symptomatic. On the other hand, with the continuous evolution of therapeutic viral vectors, gene therapy is becoming a clinical reality. From this perspective, we wrote this review\u00a0to illustrate the current state regarding viral-mediated gene therapy in childhood neurological disorders.",

        "Title": "Characterizing spatial dependence of boron, arsenic, and other trace elements for Permian groundwater in Northern Anhui plain coal mining area, China, using spatial autocorrelation index and geostatistics.",
        "Abstract": "Anthropogenic and geological factors play an essential role in the variability of groundwater quality, resulting in a weak spatial dependence of groundwater trace elements. Thus, it is an essential study to investigate the factors affecting groundwater quality and its spatial abundance of trace elements (including As, B, and other metalloids). In this study, samples are obtained from a Permian sandstone fracture aquifer in a coal mining area. A multivariate statistical analysis, hydrogeochemistry modeling, and spatial autocorrelation analysis were used to analyze the data. The results showed that Moran index was positive for all trace elements, which had good spatial autocorrelation. The Local indicators of spatial association (LISA) indicated that trace elements were clustered. The hydrogeochemical modeling results indicated that the precipitation and stability of iron-phase minerals, such as rhodochrosite and arsenic (As) absorption on the surface of iron-phase minerals in the aquifer, may limit concentrations in the southern region. The spatial autocorrelations of both As and Boron (B) were positive (high-high) in the western areas, indicating that As contamination occurred from both natural geological causes and human coal mining activities. In contrast, B contamination was mainly linked to the influence of human agricultural or industrial activities. Over 96% of the groundwater concentrations of As (10\u00a0\u03bcg/L) and B (300\u00a0\u03bcg/L) in the study area exceeded World Health Organization (WHO) limits. Overall, the results of this work could help decision-makers involved in regional water quality management visualize disperse zones where specific anthropogenic and geological processes may threaten groundwater quality.",

        "Abstract": "Motility is one of the most critical features to evaluate sperm quality. As longitudinal rolling of human sperm has long been ignored until recently, its detailed dynamics and cellular biological mechanisms are still largely unknown. Here we report an optical-tweezers-based method to evaluate the chirality and frequency of sperm rotation. According to the intensity distribution patterns of off-focus micron-size particles, we established a method to judge the orientation of the sperm head along the optical axis in the optical trap. Together with the rotation direction of the projection of the sperm head, the chirality of longitudinal rolling of sperm can be measured without the application of three-dimensional tracking techniques or complex optical design. By video tracking optically trapped sperm cells from different patients, both rolling chirality and rolling frequency were analyzed. In this study, all the vertically trapped human sperm cells adopt a right-hand longitudinal rolling. The orientation and rolling frequency but not the rolling chirality of sperm in the optical trap are affected by the trap height. The rotation analysis method developed in this study may have clinical potential for sperm quality evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "The accurate estimation of the mass and center of gravity (CG) position is key to vehicle dynamics modeling. The perturbation of key parameters in vehicle dynamics models can result in a reduction of accurate vehicle control and may even cause serious traffic accidents. A dual robust embedded cubature Kalman filter (RECKF) algorithm, which takes into account unknown measurement noise, is proposed for the joint estimation of mass and CG position. First, the mass parameters are identified based on directly obtained longitudinal forces in the distributed drive electric vehicle tires using the whole vehicle longitudinal dynamics model and the RECKF. Then, the CG is estimated with the RECKF using the mass estimation results and the vertical vehicle model. Finally, different virtual tests show that, compared with the cubature Kalman algorithm, the RECKF reduces the root mean square error of mass and CG by at least 7.4%, and 2.9%, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Early diagnosis of drug susceptibility for tuberculosis (TB) patients could guide the timely initiation of effective treatment. We evaluated a novel multiplex xMAP TIER (Tuberculosis-Isoniazid-Ethambutol-Rifampicin) assay based on the Luminex xMAP system to detect first-line anti-tuberculous drug resistance. Deoxyribonucleic acid samples from 353 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates were amplified by multiplex polymerase chain reaction, followed by hybridization and analysis through the xMAP system. Compared with the broth microdilution method, the sensitivity and specificity of the xMAP TIER assay for detecting resistance was 94.9% (95%CI, 90.0-99.8%) and 98.9% (95%CI, 97.7-100.0%) for rifampicin; 89.1% (95%CI, 83.9-94.3%) and 100.0% (95%CI, 100.0-100.0%) for isoniazid; 82.1% (95% CI, 68.0-96.3%) and 99.7% (95% CI, 99.0-100.0%) for ethambutol. With DNA sequencing as the reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity of xMAP TIER for detecting resistance were 95.0% (95% CI, 90.2-99.8%) and 99.6% (95% CI, 98.9-100.0%) for rifampicin; 96.9% (95% CI, 93.8-99.9%) and 100.0% (95% CI, 100.0-100.0%) for isoniazid; 86.1% (95% CI, 74.8-97.4%) and 100.0% (95% CI, 100.0-100.0%) for ethambutol. The results achieved showed that the xMAP TIER assay had good performance for detecting first-line anti-tuberculosis drug resistance, and it has the potential to diagnose drug-resistant tuberculosis more accurately due to the addition of more optimal design primers and probes on open architecture xMAP system.",

The effects of MD on the physicochemical, microstructural, and cooking properties of sweet potato starch (SPS) noodles, as well as the mechanism of SPS-MD interactions, are discussed. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicated that MD at a suitable concentration can improve the ordered structure of SPS-MD gels. The cooking loss showed lower values of 1.47\u22122.16% at 0.5\u22122.0 wt% MD. For the texture properties, an increase in hardness and chewiness occurred at first with the addition of MD, followed by a decreasing trend, showing a maximum value at 2.0 wt% of MD. The pasting and thermal results verified the increased stability of the starch granules with MD < 3 wt%. Additionally, SPS formed a solid-like gel with MD, and the main interaction forces between SPS and MD were hydrogen bonding. The scanning electron microscopy results revealed that the higher concentrations of MD (>3 wt%) loosened the gel structure and markedly increased the pore size. These results help us to better understand the interaction mechanism of the SPS-MD complex and facilitate the development of SPS-based gel products.",

        "Abstract": "Melatonin (MT) can improve the effect of cryopreservation on oocytes by suppressing oxidative stress and maintaining the permeability of the oolemma. In this study, MT was firstly applied to human oocytes' cryopreservation to explore the effect of prolonged cryopreservation on developmental competence and its role. Collected in vitro-matured human oocytes were cryopreserved in MT-containing or MT-free medium for 0 and 6 months; after warming, viable oocytes were assessed for developmental viability, intracellular protein expression, mitochondrial function, and oxidation-antioxidant system. Meanwhile, fresh oocytes were set as the control. The results showed that with the extension of cryopreservation time, the developmental competence of oocytes gradually declined, accompanied by the down-regulation of most mitochondrial function-related proteins, the reduction in ATP and GSH production, the increase in ROS accumulation, and the aggravation of the imbalance of ROS/GSH in oocytes. However, the participation of MT seemed to effectively mitigate these negative effects. Therefore, we speculate that melatonin may maintain normal ATP production and ROS/GSH balance in cryopreserved oocytes by protecting mitochondrial function and inhibiting oxidative damage, thereby effectively maintaining the developmental competence of human oocytes in prolonged cryopreservation.",

        "Abstract": "This study investigated the effects of low molecular weight organic acids (citric acid and malic acid) on the migration properties of nickel in soil. A reclaimed soil sample was obtained from the Panyi Mine in Huainan City, China. The effects of adding different concentrations of Ni, citric acid (CA) and malic acid (MA) were assessed on the migration and transformation of soil Ni forms. The results showed: (1) An increase in soil Ni activity with increasing Ni concentrations. (2) An increased proportion of exchangeable forms of Ni in soil with increased malic acid and citric acid concentrations, effectively promoting Ni mobility. In addition, the active Ni fraction in reclaimed soil increased significantly with increasing concentrations of citric and malic acid. The nickel activation effect of citric acid was found to be higher than that of malic acid. (3) The activation effect of organic acids on Ni weakened with aging, exhibiting a gradual transformation from the loosely bound form of Ni, to the strongly bound form. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the phytoremediation techniques used for the treatment of Ni-polluted soils.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, the physicochemical properties, antioxidant and anti-aging abilities of three new Tremella hydrocolloids were studied. The physicochemical properties were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimeter, X-ray diffractometry etc. The antioxidant activities of Tremella hydrocolloids were determined by ABTS radical, DPPH radical scavenging activity. The anti-aging ability of Tremella hydrocolloids was also investigated by using the organism model of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). The results showed that the ES-THD displayed the highest radical scavenging capacity and the best anti-aging abilities. The ability of ES-THD to scavenge ABTS radicals reached 100\u00a0% at 2\u00a0mg/mL, the ability of ES-THD to scavenge DPPH radicals reached 45.55\u00a0%. Compared with the control group, the average lifespan was 29.17\u00a0% longer fed with ES-THD. These results provide the evidence basis for the use of Tremella hydrocolloids as food texture modifiers, antioxidants, and anti-aging agents in the food industries.",

Nanocellulose with many excellent properties can be used as a carrier and stabilizer to assist in the synthesis of AgNPs. In this study, cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were used to assist in the synthesis of AgNPs under the reduction of glucose and detection of glucose concentration under different conditions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed that the AgNPs in the nanocellulose-AgNPs (NC-AgNPs) system were roughly spherical and randomly distributed on the nanocellulose. In the whole reaction system, when the concentration of nanocellulose is 0.11 mg/mL, the concentration of silver ammonia solution is 0.6 mM, and the mixing time is 2.5 h, according to the UV-Vis analysis, the absorbance of CNF-AgNPs at 425 nm exhibited a good linear relationship (R",

        "Abstract": "Osteoclasts are the only multinucleated cells in vivo responsible for bone resorption and are vital for regulating bone remodeling and maintaining bone mass. The RAW264.7 cell line is widely used to study osteoclastic differentiation and biological molecular mechanism. However, protocols for inducing osteoclast formation in RAW264.7 cells vary considerably between laboratories, hindering the replication of results. Therefore, we tested the influence of culture conditions on osteoclast differentiation, including cell density and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) concentrations with or without macrophage colony-stimulating factors (M-CSF). Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining was used to detect the morphology of osteoclasts. qPCR was used to detect gene expression of osteoclast-specific gene marker cathepsin K (CTSK), osteoclast transcription factors c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). The bone resorption function was evaluated by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). RANKL treatment increased multinucleated osteoclasts formation and increased CTSK, c-Fos and NFATc1 gene expression. Compared with RANKL treatment, M-CSF significantly decreased multinucleated osteoclasts formation, reduced CTSK gene expression and had little effect on c-Fos and NFATc1 gene expression. Concerning bone resorption activity, RANKL treatment increased bone resorption pits on bovine bone slices. Significantly higher levels of osteoclastogenesis were observed with RAW264.7-cell density of 2\u00d7104 cells/well in 24-well plates. Our results suggest that the addition of 50 ng/ml M-CSF has no positive effect on osteoclastogenesis. RANKL treatment and cell density contribute to osteoclast formation, and the optimal conditions are beneficial when exploring osteoclast function and mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "For polymer solar cells (PSCs), the mixture of polymer donors and small-molecule acceptors (SMAs) is fine-tuned to realize a favorable kinetically trapped morphology and thus a commercially viable device efficiency. However, the thermodynamic relaxation of the mixed domains within the blend raises concerns related to the long-term operational stability of the devices, especially in the record-holding Y-series SMAs. Here, a new class of dimeric Y6-based SMAs tethered with differential flexible spacers is reported to regulate their aggregation and relaxation behavior. In their polymer blends with PM6, it is found that they favor an improved structural order relative to that of Y6 counterpart. Most importantly, the tethered SMAs show large glass transition temperatures to suppress the thermodynamic relaxation in mixed domains. For the high-performing dimeric blend, an unprecedented open circuit voltage of 0.87\u00a0V is realized with a conversion efficiency of 17.85%, while those of regular Y6-base devices only reach 0.84\u00a0V and 16.93%, respectively. Most importantly, the dimer-based device possesses substantially reduced burn-in efficiency loss, retaining more than 80% of the initial efficiency after operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 700\u00a0h. The tethering approach provides a new direction to develop PSCs with high efficiency and excellent operating stability.",

        "Abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most serious global public health concerns. However, there are currently no effective drugs for treatment of this disease. Icariin (ICA), a small-molecule natural product extracted from Epimedium brevicornu Maxim, offers various pharmacological activities. In the present work, we wondered whether ICA can attenuate NAFLD in db/db mice treated with ICA for 8 weeks and how ICA exerts an influence on NAFLD. In db/db mice, ICA treatment had a robust effect on inhibition of lipogenesis associated with NAFLD amelioration by decreasing liver lipid deposition, together with ameliorating insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and fasting serum glucose. Of note, ICA-treated rats showed a much higher concentration of icaritin (ICT) in plasma, a major metabolite of ICA, about 2000 times higher than that of ICA by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Interestingly, ICT, rather than ICA, can dramatically decrease hepatic lipogenesis-related markers in oleate acid/palmitate acid (OA/PA)-induced steatosis in primary hepatocytes (PH) and HepG2 cells, and hepatic lipid accumulation in db/db mice, demonstrating the inhibitory effect of ICT on lipogenesis. Mechanistically, we found that anti-lipogenic activities of ICT were related to reducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as evidenced by Western blot, qPCR, and other assays in thapsigargin (THP) induced-ER stress models. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the unexpected and key role for ICT on the prevention of NAFLD in db/db mice through an ER stress mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "The separation of C8 aromatics (xylenes and ethylbenzene) remains one of the most challenging industrial separations due to their similar structures and properties. Suitable adsorbents that can distinguish the small differences among isomers are urgently demanded. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to realize the precise discrimination of C8 aromatics by constructing a nonaromatic confined pore environment with mixed polycycloalkane-type ligands. The nonaromatic low-polar pore environment avoids strong convergent interactions between the framework and the common phenyl rings while creating possibilities to amplify the difference between host-guest/guest-guest interactions regarding the different methyl (ethyl) group positions of isomers. The resultant metal-organic framework, ZUL-C3, with either tetragonal or monoclinic lattice, exhibits outstanding separation performance for C8 aromatics, not only realizing the simultaneous separation of four isomers from each other but also setting a benchmark for the dynamic separation performance of OX/PX and OX/MX.",

        "Abstract": "Mcm2, a subunit of the minichromosome maintenance proteins 2-7 (Mcm2-7) helicase best known for its role in DNA replication, contains a histone binding motif that facilitates the transfer of parental histones following DNA replication. Here, we show that Mcm2 is important for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The Mcm2-2A mutation defective in histone binding shows defects in silencing of pluripotent genes and the induction of lineage-specific genes. The defects in the induction of lineage-specific genes in the mutant cells are likely, at least in part, due to reduced binding to Asf1a, a histone chaperone that binds Mcm2 and is important for nucleosome disassembly at bivalent chromatin domains containing repressive H3K27me3 and active H3K4me3 modifications during differentiation. Mcm2 localizes at transcription starting sites and the binding of Mcm2 at gene promoters is disrupted in both Mcm2-2A ES cells and neural precursor cells (NPCs). Reduced Mcm2 binding at bivalent chromatin domains in Mcm2-2A ES cells correlates with decreased chromatin accessibility at corresponding sites in NPCs. Together, our studies reveal a novel function of Mcm2 in ES cell differentiation, likely through manipulating chromatin landscapes at bivalent chromatin domains.",

        "Abstract": "The intramolecular electron push-pulling effect has been widely applied to manipulate the excited states in organic photovoltaic (OPV) molecules toward efficient photocurrent generation in working devices with bias fields. However, the effect of field induced polar environments on the excited-state dynamics remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the polar environment effect on excited dynamics in acceptor-donor-acceptor type OPV molecules dissolved in solvents with different polarities. By combining ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum chemical computation, we observe the stabilization of excited states induced by symmetry breaking in the polar solvent in the molecules exhibiting strong electron push-pulling effects. The stabilized excited states undergo faster intersystem crossing processes with reduced singlet-triplet energy gaps. The findings suggest that the dynamics of charge generation and recombination may be controlled by manipulating the polar environment and electron push-pulling effect to improve the device performance.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with diffuse midline gliomas that are H3K27 altered (DMG) display a dismal prognosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying DMG tumorigenesis remain poorly defined. Here we show that SMARCA4, the catalytic subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is essential for the proliferation, migration, and invasion of DMG cells and tumor growth in patient-derived DMG xenograft models. SMARCA4 colocalizes with SOX10 at gene regulatory elements to control the expression of genes involved in cell growth and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Moreover, SMARCA4 chromatin binding is reduced upon depletion of SOX10 or H3.3K27M, a mutation occurring in about 60% DMG tumors. Furthermore, the SMARCA4 occupancy at enhancers marked by both SOX10 and H3K27 acetylation is reduced the most upon depleting the H3.3K27M mutation. Taken together, our results support a model in which epigenome reprogramming by H3.3K27M creates a dependence on SMARCA4-mediated chromatin remodeling to drive gene expression and the pathogenesis of H3.3K27M DMG.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the clinical effects of microdissection testicular sperm extraction (micro-TESE) surgery combined with an intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) regimen in the treatment of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) patients with different etiologies. In total, 128 NOA patients participated in this study, in which they received infertility treatment by micro-TESE surgery combined with an ICSI regimen, and all patients were divided into three groups [the Klinefelter syndrome (KS), the idiopathic and the secondary NOA groups]. In addition, the sperm retrieval rate (SRR), fertilization rate, embryo development status and clinical treatment effects were analyzed. Among the 128 NOA patients, the SRR of KS NOA patients was 48.65%, those of idiopathic and the secondary patients were 33.82% and 73.91%, respectively. Regardless of etiologies, there was no correlation with age, hormone value or testicular volume. Further analysis showed that the SRR of the KS group was positively related with testosterone (T) values, and the SRR of the secondary group had a positive relationship with follicle-stimulating hormone or luteinizing hormone values. In the subsequent clinical treatment, the retrieved sperm was subjected to ICSI and achieved good treatment effects, especially in the secondary group, and the implantation rate (55.56%) and clinical pregnancy rate (68.42%) were both higher than those of the idiopathic group (28.75% and 40.00%) and KS group (22.05% and 30.77%). Micro-TESE surgery combined with ICSI insemination is the most effective treatment regimen for NOA patients. The SRR of NOA patients with different etiologies are related to certain specific factors, and micro-TESE surgery seems to be the ideal and only way to have biological children.",

Here, we developed a highly sensitive oxygen gas sensor based on deep ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy between 180 and 200 nm. The implemented method relies on differential absorption spectra extracted from the obtained high-resolution absorption spectra. The detection capability was greatly improved (six-fold) by eliminating air from the open optical path, achieved by purging the entire system with pure nitrogen. A linear relationship was obtained between the optical parameter and the oxygen concentration with a slope of 0.107 and determination coefficient of 0.999. A detection limit of 24 ppm per meter was determined with a response time of 25 s. Good repeatability (",

        "Abstract": "Thermal management of concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) modules is essential to avoid the decrease in conversion efficiency caused by temperature rise during their operation. This is even more important for laser-concentrated CPV hybrid systems where out-of-control temperature rise is more likely to happen. In this research, a three-dimensional simulation model for a concentrated photovoltaic-thermoelectric (CPV-TE) hybrid system was studied to optimize its parameters and improve its conversion efficiency under laser radiation. Based on the simulation results, an integrated CPV-TE device was designed, fabricated, and tested under a high-power laser. The novel integrated CPV-TE system utilizes growing electrodes to encapsulate CPV directly on the TEG. Compared to conventional CPV-TE systems that utilize silicone-filled, the integrated CPV-TE system reduces contact thermal resistance and increases output power as well as conversion efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to discuss and optimize a CPV-TE hybrid system for laser radiation. In addition, this research improves the efficiency of laser energy conversion, increases the reliability and stability of the system, and may facilitate the promotion of optical wireless and fiber power transmission systems in future applications.",

Both aryl/alkenyl iodines and bromides were found to be competent electrophiles that reacted with alkyl isocyanides, affording nitrile compounds in moderate to good yields. A range of functional groups including halogens as well as hydroxyl, formyl, and acetamino groups were fairly compatible with the nickel catalysis. This protocol featured broad functional group tolerance, simple reaction conditions, and gram-scale synthesis.",

But most existing EEG studies focus on mean group effects (commonality) by averaging signals over trials and subjects. The substantial intra- and inter-subject variability of EEG have often been overlooked. The recently significant technological advances in machine learning, especially deep learning, have brought technological innovations to EEG signal application in many aspects, but there are still great challenges in cross-session, cross-task, and cross-subject EEG decoding.

        "Title": "Histone methylation antagonism drives tumor immune evasion in squamous cell carcinomas.",
        "Abstract": "How cancer-associated chromatin abnormalities shape tumor-immune interaction remains incompletely understood. Recent studies have linked DNA hypomethylation and de-repression of retrotransposons to anti-tumor immunity through the induction of interferon response. Here, we report that inactivation of the histone H3K36 methyltransferase NSD1, which is frequently found in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and induces DNA hypomethylation, unexpectedly results in diminished tumor immune infiltration. In syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse models of head and neck SCCs, NSD1-deficient tumors exhibit immune exclusion and reduced interferon response despite high retrotransposon expression. Mechanistically, NSD1 loss results in silencing of innate immunity genes, including the type III interferon receptor IFNLR1, through depletion of H3K36 di-methylation (H3K36me2) and gain of H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3). Inhibition of EZH2 restores immune infiltration and impairs the growth of Nsd1-mutant tumors. Thus, our work uncovers a druggable chromatin cross talk that regulates the viral mimicry response and enables immune evasion of DNA hypomethylated tumors.",

        "Abstract": "Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration (IVDD) which is highly prevalent within the elderly population, is a leading cause of chronic low back pain and disability. Nucleus pulposus (NP) cell senescence plays an indispensable role in the pathogenesis of IVDD. Morroniside is a major iridoid glycoside and one of the quality control metrics of Cornus officinalis Siebold & Zucc (CO). An increasing body of evidence suggests that morroniside and CO-containing formulae share many similar biological effects, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-apoptotic properties. In a previous study, we reported that Liuwei Dihuang Decoction, a CO-containing formula, is effective for treating IVDD by targeting p53 expression; however, the therapeutic role of morroniside on IVDD remains obscure. In this study, we assessed the pharmacological effects of morroniside on NP cell senescence and IVDD pathogenesis using a lumbar spine instability surgery-induced mouse IVDD model and an ",

        "Abstract": "Starch nanoparticles (SNPs) were produced from sweet potato starches by ultrasonic treatment combined with rapid nanoprecipitation. The starch concentration, ultrasonic time, and the ratio of starch solution to ethanol were optimized through dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique to obtain SNPs with a Z-average size of 64.51 \u00b1 0.15\u00a0nm, poly dispersity index (PDI) of 0.23 \u00b1 0.01. However, after freeze drying, the SNPs showed varying degrees of aggregation depending on the particle size of SNPs before freeze-drying. The smaller the particle size, the more serious the aggregation. Therefore, we tried to treat SNPs with dielectric barrier discharge cold plasma before freeze drying. Properties including morphological features, crystalline structure and apparent viscosity of various starches were measured by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and rheometer, respectively. The results showed that, after cold plasma (CP) treatment, the aggregation of SNPs during freeze drying was significantly inhibited. Compared to the native sweet potato starch, SNPs showed a higher relative crystallinity and a lower apparent viscosity. After CP treatment, the relative crystallinity of CP SNPs was further higher, and the apparent viscosity was lower. This work provides new ideas for the preparation of SNPs and could promote the development of sweet potato SNPs in the field of active ingredient delivery.",

        "Abstract": "Dietary intake is one of the main pathways for residents to become exposed to chlorinated paraffins (CPs). In China, due to the popularization of nutritional and medicinal edible fungi, consumption has increased on a yearly basis. Edible fungi have a variety of active substances and are consumed daily by residents. However, there is limited information on the concentration and source of chlorinated paraffins in edible fungi. In this study, the concentrations of short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs) in 105 edible fungi samples and 36 culture material samples were detected. The concentration range of SCCPs was 79.8\u00a0ng/g dw to 3879.3\u00a0ng/g dw, and the MCCPs was ND to 572.3\u00a0ng/g dw. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that the sources of SCCPs and MCCPs in edible fungi were similar (r =\u00a00.57, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The preponderant SCCPs and MCCPs congener group profiles were C",

        "Title": "Biliary NIK promotes ductular reaction and liver injury and fibrosis in mice.",
        "Abstract": "Excessive cholangiocyte expansion (ductular reaction) promotes liver disease progression, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we identify biliary NF-\u03baB-inducing kinase (NIK) as a pivotal regulator of ductular reaction. NIK is known to activate the noncanonical IKK\u03b1/NF-\u03baB2 pathway and regulate lymphoid tissue development. We find that cholangiocyte NIK is upregulated in mice with cholestasis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL), 5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC), or \u03b1-naphtyl-isothiocyanate (ANIT). DDC, ANIT, or BDL induces ductular reaction, liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis in mice. Cholangiocyte-specific deletion of NIK, but not IKK\u03b1, blunts these pathological alterations. NIK inhibitor treatment similarly ameliorates DDC-induced ductular reaction, liver injury, and fibrosis. Biliary NIK directly increases cholangiocyte proliferation while suppressing cholangiocyte death, and it also promotes secretion of cholangiokines from cholangiocytes. Cholangiokines stimulate liver macrophages and hepatic stellate cells, augmenting liver inflammation and fibrosis. These results unveil a NIK/ductular reaction axis and a NIK/cholangiokine axis that promote liver disease progression.",

        "Title": "Melatonin attenuates di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate-induced apoptosis of human granulosa cells by inhibiting mitochondrial fission.",
        "Abstract": "Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is one of the most used plasticizers which have contaminated environment widely, and its extensive use causes female reproductive injury. Melatonin has a substantial protective effect against female reproductive toxicity. This study was undertaken to investigate the influence of melatonin on DEHP-induced damage of human granulosa cells (GCs) in vitro and explore the potential mechanisms. Here, we found that melatonin treatment alleviated DEHP-induced human GCs apoptosis and improved mitochondrial function via inhibiting dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) mediated mitochondrial fission. Melatonin inhibited the expression, activation and oligomerization of Drp1, which decreased translocation of Drp1 to mitochondria in DEHP-exposed human GCs. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, sustained mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased cytochrome c release. Further research showed that AMPK-PGC-1\u03b1 signal pathway was involved in the inhibition of melatonin on Drp1 expression and activation. Melatonin treatment promoted AMPK activation suppressed by DEHP, and activated AMPK recovered the balance of Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser616 and Ser637 sites and enhanced PGC-1\u03b1 expression. Moreover, PGC-1\u03b1 could prevent mitochondrial fission by decreasing Drp1 expression directly via binding to its promoter. In contrast, blocking of AMPK or PGC-1\u03b1 with specific inhibitor negated the protective effects of melatonin on mitochondrial homeostasis and GCs apoptosis. In summary, our results indicated the protective effects of melatonin on improving mitochondrial function and attenuating cells injury in DEHP-exposed human GCs. Melatonin treatment may be a promising therapeutic approach against DEHP-induced reproductive disorder.",

Here, we introduce culture-enriched phenotypic metagenomics that integrates culture enrichment, phenotypic screening, and metagenomic analyses as an emerging standardized methodology for targeted resistome monitoring and apply it to decipher the extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactam resistome in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and its receiving river. The results showed that clinically prevalent carbapenemase genes (e.g., the NDM and KPC families) and extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase genes (e.g., the CTX-M, TEM, and OXA families) were prevalent in the WWTP and showed prominent potential in horizontal dissemination. Strikingly, carbapenem and polymyxin resistance genes co-occurred in the highly virulent nosocomial pathogens ",

        "Abstract": "The effect of low-molecular-weight organic acids (citric acid and malic acid) on the migration characteristics of Pb in contaminated soils was explored in this study. Reclaimed soil was collected from the coal gangue hill area of the Panyi mine in Huainan City (China). The effect of citric acid and malic acid on the form of Pb present in the reclaimed soil was analyzed by spiking soil samples and simulating Pb-contaminated soil. The results indicate the following. 1) With increased concentration of exogenous Pb, the activity of Pb in the reclaimed soil was effectively improved. 2) The addition of citric acid and malic acid both resulted in an increased fraction of exchangeable Pb in the soil, which effectively promoted the active Pb fraction. As the concentrations of citric acid and malic acid increased, the active Pb fraction of the reclaimed soil increased accordingly. The Pb activation effect of citric acid was observed to be greater than that of malic acid. 3) With extended soil aging time, the activation effect of organic acids on Pb weakened, with the loosely bound Pb gradually transforming into strongly bound Pb. Chelating agents can activate heavy metals in soil, mainly through the combination of chelating agents and heavy metal ions in the soil solution to form soluble metal chelates, so as to increase the bioavailability of heavy metals in soil to plant roots. Therefore, adding citric acid can be considered as a strategy to enhance the efficiency of reclaimed soil remediation because of the ability of Pb activation.",

        "Abstract": "Osteoclasts (OCs) are multinucleated cells that play a major role in osteolytic diseases such as osteoporosis. Monascin (Ms) is one of the active substances in the traditional Chinese medicine red yeast rice. Studies have found that red yeast rice can maintain bone health. In this study, the anti-osteoclastogenesis effects of Ms on RANKL-induced RAW264.7 cells were assessed, and the underlying mechanism was investigated. Ms exhibited inhibitory effects on OC differentiation and formation in a dose-dependent manner and suppressed the bone-resorbing activity of mature OCs. Ms blocked OCs-typical genes (c-Fos, NFATc1, CSTK, MMP-9, TRAP, ITG-\u03b23, OSCAR and DC-STAMP). Furthermore, Ms treatment considerably inhibited the activation of MAPKs, JNK and p38. Taken together, Ms suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 cells by restraining MAPKs signaling pathways and is a potential therapeutic option as a novel OC inhibitor to mitigate bone erosion.",

        "Abstract": "The fine-tuning of the pore structure of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is of critical importance to developing energy-efficient processes for the challenging separation of structurally similar molecules. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to realize a quasi-three-dimensional refinement of the pore structure that utilizes the tunability of ring size and number in polycycloalkane-dicarboxylate ligands. Two hydrolytically stable MOFs with a confined aliphatic pore environment, ZUL-C1 and ZUL-C2, were, for the first time, synthesized and applied in separating low-concentration C2-C3 hydrocarbons from natural gas and ultralow-concentration Xe from used nuclear fuel (UNF) off-gas. Validated by X-ray diffraction and modeling, an expansion of the polycycloalkane moiety enables sub-angstrom contraction in specific directions and forms a pore surface with more alkyl sites, which affords stronger trapping of guest molecules with relatively higher polarizability. The resultant material exhibits record C",

        "Abstract": "Ovarian tissue cryopreservation and transplantation are novel therapeutic approaches for fertility preservation. However, follicle loss caused by ischemic and hypoxic damage is one of the issues after frozen-thawed ovarian tissue transplantation. Promoting angiogenesis in grafts is the key to restore cryopreserved ovarian function. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been reported to facilitate angiogenesis in the cryopreserved ovarian tissue transplantation. However, the risk of embolization, immunogenic effect and tumorigenesis hinders the clinical application of MSCs to human organ transplantation. In this study, we established an in vitro ovarian culture system to restore frozen-thawed ovarian function before transplantation with the application of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs), and explored the effects of UC-MSCs on frozen-thawed ovaries in vitro ovarian culture system and the mechanisms of UC-MSCs on the angiogenesis of frozen-thawed ovaries.",

        "Abstract": "Zona pellucida (ZP) abnormalities are the cause of low fertility or infertility, agar-like ZP is more common in abnormal ZP. The purpose of this exploration is to systematically analyze the fertilization competence of agar-like ZP oocytes, the development characteristics of subsequent embryos as well as the results of embryo transfer, aiming to explore effective clinical treatment strategies. A total of 58 patients with agar-like ZP were set as the case group and the control group involved 3866 patients, in which the patients' oocytes presented normal ZP. BMI, basal hormone levels, and hormone levels were similar in both groups. The case patients suffered significantly longer infertility years than control (p<0.05), and most patients were diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory diseases. A distinct difference was observed in the structure of oocyte corona cumulus complexes between the two groups. The embryo development parameters, which include the rates of cleavage, high-quality embryo, blastocyst, and high-quality blastocyst in the case group were greatly lower than that in the control group (p<0.05). The rates of cumulative clinical pregnancy and live birth were comparable between the two groups. In the subsequent follow-up, thirty-four of the 58 patients receiving intracytoplasmic single sperm injection (ICSI) or early rescue ICSI (R-ICSI) treatment successfully gave birth to babies, and all of the newborns were with no neonatal defects. In addition, the fertilization rate of the R-ICSI group was significantly lower than that of the ICSI group (p<0.05). The occurrence of agar-like ZP impairs the development competence of human oocytes, however, the human oocytes with agar-like ZP can develop into healthy offspring, and an ICSI regimen is the optimal treatment strategy for them.",

        "Abstract": "Sacubitril/valsartan, the first angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration for marketing, has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization and improve symptoms in patients with chronic heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. However, some researchers have also found that sacubitril/valsartan has an antiarrhythmic effect. The mechanism by which sacubitril/valsartan reduces the mortality associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias is not precise. Many studies have concluded that ventricular arrhythmia is associated with a reduction in myocardial fibrosis. This article reviews the current understanding of the effects of sacubitril/valsartan on the reduction of ventricular arrhythmia and explains its possible mechanisms. The results of this study suggest that sacubitril/valsartan reduces the occurrence of appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks. Meanwhile, sacubitril/valsartan may reduce the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias by affecting 3 pathways of B-type natriuretic peptide, Angiotensin II, and Bradykinin. The conclusion of this study is that sacubitril/valsartan reduces the number of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks and ventricular arrhythmias in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients.",

        "Abstract": "Multi-cellular organisms such as humans contain hundreds of cell types that share the same genetic information (DNA sequences), and yet have different cellular traits and functions. While how genetic information is passed through generations has been extensively characterized, it remains largely obscure how epigenetic information encoded by chromatin regulates the passage of certain traits, gene expression states and cell identity during mitotic cell divisions, and even through meiosis. In this review, we will summarize the recent advances on molecular mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance, discuss the potential impacts of epigenetic inheritance during normal development and in some disease conditions, and outline future research directions for this challenging, but exciting field.",

        "Abstract": "Imide-functionalized arenes have been one of the most promising acceptor (A) units in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, dithienophthalimide (DPI), a hybrid of thieno-[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) and bithiophene imide (BTI) units, has not been revisited since its first synthesis, likely owing to the high synthetic cost of the reported method. In this work, we simplified the synthetic procedure of the DPI skeleton with a significant reduction of the synthetic cost by using chromium-mediated cyclization as the key chemistry. Using this method, two DPI-based nonhalogenated D-A copolymers are synthesized. The binary OSCs based on pBDTT-DPI-Me\u2009:\u2009Y6 achieves a power conversion efficiency as high as 16.55\u2009%, highlighting DPI as an attractive A-unit for further exploration in OSCs.",

        "Abstract": "DNA replication stress threatens ordinary DNA synthesis. The evolutionarily conserved DNA replication stress response pathway involves sensor kinase Mec1/ATR, adaptor protein Mrc1/Claspin, and effector kinase Rad53/Chk1, which spurs a host of changes to stabilize replication forks and maintain genome integrity. DNA replication forks consist of largely distinct sets of proteins at leading and lagging strands that function autonomously in DNA synthesis in vitro. In this article, we discuss eSPAN and BrdU-IP-ssSeq, strand-specific sequencing technologies that permit analysis of protein localization and DNA synthesis at individual strands in budding yeast. Using these approaches, we show that under replication stress Rad53 stalls DNA synthesis on both leading and lagging strands. On lagging strands, it stimulates PCNA unloading, and on leading strands, it attenuates the replication function of Mrc1-Tof1. We propose that in doing so, Rad53 couples leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis during replication stress, thereby preventing the emergence of harmful ssDNA.",

        "Abstract": "Spatially remote brain regions show synchronized activity as typically revealed by correlated functional MRI (fMRI) signals. An emerging line of research has focused on the temporal fluctuations of connectivity; however, its relationships with stationary connectivity have not been clearly illustrated. We examined dynamic and stationary connectivity when the participants watched four different movie clips. We calculated point-by-point multiplication between two regional time series to estimate the time-resolved dynamic connectivity, and estimated the inter-individual consistency of the dynamic connectivity time series. Widespread consistent dynamic connectivity was observed for each movie clip, which also showed differences between the clips. For example, a cartoon movie clip, Wall-E, showed more consistent of dynamic connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex and supramarginal gyrus, while a court drama clip, A Few Good Men, showed more consistent of dynamic connectivity with the auditory cortex and temporoparietal junction, which might suggest the involvement of specific brain processing for different movie contents. In contrast, the stationary connectivity as measured by the correlations between regional time series was highly similar among the movie clips, and showed fewer statistically significant differences. The patterns of consistent dynamic connectivity could be used to classify different movie clips with higher accuracy than the stationary connectivity and regional activity. These results support the functional significance of dynamic connectivity in reflecting functional brain changes, which could provide more functionally relevant information than stationary connectivity.",

        "Abstract": "The acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A) or A-DA'D-A structured small molecule acceptors (SMAs) have triggered substantial progress for polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, the high-cost of the SMAs impedes the commercial viability of such renewable energy, as their synthesis via the classical pyridine-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation usually suffers from low reaction efficiency and tedious purifying work-up. Herein, we developed a simple and cheap boron trifluoride etherate-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation for addressing this challenge, and found that the coupling of the aldehyde-terminated D unit and the A-end groups could be quantitatively finished in the presence of acetic anhydride within 15\u2009minutes at room temperature. Compared with the conventional method, the high reaction efficiency of our method is related to the germinal diacetate pathway that is thermodynamically favorable to give the final products. For those high performing SMAs (such as ITIC-4F and Y6), the cost could be reduced by 50% compared with conventional preparation. In addition to the application in PSCs, our synthetic approach provides a facile and low-cost access to a wide range of D-A organic semiconductors for emerging technologies.",

        "Abstract": "Organic solar cells (OSCs) have experienced rapid progress with the innovation of near-infrared (NIR)-absorbing small-molecular acceptors (SMAs), while the unique electronic properties of the SMAs raise new challenges in relation to cathode engineering for effective electron collection. To address this issue, two fluorinated perylene-diimides (PDIs), PDINN-F and PDINN-2F, are synthesized by a simple fluorination method, for application as cathode interlayer (CIL) materials. The two bay-fluorinated PDI-based CILs possess a lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of \u2248-4.0\u00a0eV, which improves the energy level alignment at the NIR-SMAs (such as BTP-eC9)/CIL for a favorable electron extraction efficiency. The monofluorinated PDINN-F shows higher electron mobility and better improved interfacial compatibility. The PDINN-F-based OSCs with PM6:BTP-eC9 as active layer exhibit an enhanced fill factor and larger short-circuit current density, leading to a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 18%. The devices with PDINN-F CIL retain more than 80% of their initial PCE after operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 750 h. This work prescribes a facile, cost-effective, and scalable method for the preparation of stable, high-performance fluorinated CILs, and instilling promise for the NIR-SMAs-based OSCs moving forward.",

        "Abstract": "The influences of environmental factors such as weather on the human brain are still largely unknown. A few neuroimaging studies have demonstrated seasonal effects, but were limited by their cross-sectional design or sample sizes. Most importantly, the stability of the MRI scanner has not been taken into account, which may also be affected by environments. In the current study, we analyzed longitudinal resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data from eight individuals, where they were scanned over months to years. We applied machine learning regression to use different resting-state parameters, including the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity matrix, to predict different weather and environmental parameters. For careful control, the raw EPI and the anatomical images were also used for predictions. We first found that daylight length and air temperatures could be reliably predicted with cross-validation using the resting-state parameters. However, similar prediction accuracies could also be achieved by using one frame of EPI image, and even higher accuracies could be achieved by using the segmented or raw anatomical images. Finally, the signals outside of the brain in the anatomical images and signals in phantom scans could also achieve higher prediction accuracies, suggesting that the predictability may be due to the baseline signals of the MRI scanner. After all, we did not identify detectable influences of weather on brain functions other than the influences on the baseline signals of MRI scanners. The results highlight the difficulty of studying long-term effects using MRI.",

        "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are involved in cancer development, but the roles of most lncRNAs are undocumented. In this study, we identified lncRNAs that were abnormally expressed in bladder cancer. We found that lncRNACASC9 plays an important role in the progression of bladder cancer. CASC9 was highly expressed in bladder cancer cells and tissues, and the prognosis of bladder cancer patients with high expression of CASC9 was poor. The results of colony formation assays, CCK-8 assays, EdU assays, transwell assays, mouse xenograft models, and tail vein injection lung metastasis model showed that CASC9 could promote bladder cancer cells growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, through FISH experiments, luciferase reporter experiments, and RIP experiments, we proved that CASC9 regulated the expression of TK1 by adsorbing miR-195-5p, thereby exerting an oncogenic effect in bladder cancer. Taken together, our findings support that the CASC9/miR-195-5p/TK1 axis is a critical pathway in the tumorigenesis and progression of bladder cancer, implicating a new therapeutic direction for the treatment of bladder cancer.",

        "Abstract": "For micron-sized nickel-based hydroxides sheets, the reaction and migration of anions/water molecules in the inner region tends to lag behind those along the edge, which can cause structure mismatch and capacity degradation during cycles. Nanosizing and structure design is a feasible solution to shorten the ion/electron path and improve the reaction homogeneity. Herein, this study reports a novel three-stage strategy (self-assembly of NiMn-LDH/ppy-C - reduction to NiMn/ppy-C - in situ phase transformation into NiMn/NiMn-LDH/ppy-C) to reduce the sheet size of NiMn-LDH to nanometer. Triggered by electrochemical activation, NiMn-LDH nanosheets can hereby easily and orderly grow on the exposed active (111) crystal plane of Ni to establish NiMn-LDH/NiMn heterostructure around ppy-C. Importantly, nanosizing and hierarchical structure play a synergistic role to maintain structural integrity and to promote the electron/mass transfer kinetics. The NiMn/NiMn-LDH/ppy-C composite delivers superior cycling stability with almost no decay of capacity retention after 40,000 cycles at 5\u00a0A\u00a0g",

        "Abstract": "Hemerocallis fulva is a medical and edible plant. In this study, we optimized the ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) process of extracting flavonoids from Hemerocallis fulva leaves by single-factor experiments and response surface methodology (RSM). The optimum extraction conditions generating the maximal total flavonoids content was as follows: 70.6% ethanol concentration; 43.9:1 mL/g solvent to sample ratio; 61.7 \u00b0C extraction temperature. Under the optimized extraction conditions, the total flavonoid content (TFC) in eight Hemerocallis fulva varieties were determined, and H. fulva (L.) L. var. kwanso Regel had the highest TFC. The cytotoxicity of the extract was studied using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8 assay). When the concentration was less than 1.25 mg/mL, the extract had no significant cytotoxicity to HaCaT cells. The antioxidant activity was measured via chemical antioxidant activity methods in vitro and via cellular antioxidant activity methods. The results indicated that the extract had a strong ABTS and \u2022OH radical scavenging activity. Additionally, the extract had an excellent protective effect against H2O2-induced oxidative damage at a concentration of 1.25 mg/mL, which could effectively reduce the level of ROS to 106.681 \u00b1 9.733% (p < 0.001), compared with the 163.995 \u00b1 6.308% of the H2O2 group. We identified five flavonoids in the extracts using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Infrared spectroscopy indicated that the extract contained the structure of flavonoids. The results showed that the extract of Hemerocallis fulva leaves had excellent biocompatibility and antioxidant activity, and could be used as a cheap and potential source of antioxidants in the food, cosmetics, and medicine industries.",

        "Title": "Unsupervised domain selective graph convolutional network for preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer.",
        "Abstract": "Preoperative prediction of lymph node (LN) metastasis based on computed tomography (CT) scans is an important task in gastric cancer, but few machine learning-based techniques have been proposed. While multi-center datasets increase sample size and representation ability, they suffer from inter-center heterogeneity. To tackle the above issue, we propose a novel multi-source domain adaptation framework for this diagnosis task, which not only considers domain-invariant and domain-specific features, but also achieves the imbalanced knowledge transfer and class-aware feature alignment across domains. First, we develop a 3D improved feature pyramidal network (i.e., 3D IFPN) to extract common multi-level features from the high-resolution 3D CT images, where a feature dynamic transfer (FDT) module can promote the network's ability to recognize the small target (i.e., LN). Then, we design an unsupervised domain selective graph convolutional network (i.e., UDS-GCN), which mainly includes three types of components: domain-specific feature extractor, domain selector and class-aware GCN classifier. Specifically, multiple domain-specific feature extractors are employed for learning domain-specific features from the common multi-level features generated by the 3D IFPN. A domain selector via the optimal transport (OT) theory is designed for controlling the amount of knowledge transferred from source domains to the target domain. A class-aware GCN classifier is developed to explicitly enhance/weaken the intra-class/inter-class similarity of all sample pairs across domains. To optimize UDS-GCN, the domain selector and the class-aware GCN classifier provide reliable target pseudo-labels to each other in the iterative process by collaborative learning. The extensive experiments are conducted on an in-house CT image dataset collected from four medical centers to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. Experimental results verify that the proposed method boosts LN metastasis diagnosis performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

        "Abstract": "Newly synthesized H3.1 and H3.3 histones are assembled into nucleosomes by different histone chaperones in replication-coupled and replication-independent pathways, respectively. However, it is not clear how parental H3.3 molecules are transferred following DNA replication, especially when compared to H3.1. Here, by monitoring parental H3.1- and H3.3-SNAP signals, we show that parental H3.3, like H3.1, are stably transferred into daughter cells. Moreover, Mcm2-Pola1 and Pole3-Pole4, two pathways involved in parental histone transfer based upon the analysis of modifications on parental histones, participate in the transfer of both H3.1 and H3.3 following DNA replication. Lastly, we found that Mcm2, Pole3 and Pole4 mutants defective in parental histone transfer show defects in chromosome segregation. These results indicate that in contrast to deposition of newly synthesized H3.1 and H3.3, transfer of parental H3.1 and H3.3 is mediated by these shared mechanisms, which contributes to epigenetic memory of gene expression and maintenance of genome stability.",

        "Title": "Lrwd1 impacts cell proliferation and the silencing of repetitive DNA elements.",
        "Abstract": "LRWD1, also known as ORCA, is a nuclear protein functioning in multiple biological processes. Using its WD40 domain LRWD1 interacts with repressive histone marks and maintains the silencing of heterochromatin regions in mammalian cells. ORCA also associates with the origin recognition complex (ORC) and facilitates prereplication complex formation at late-replicating origins. However, whether LRWD1 plays a role during development and the functional significance of LRWD1 in vivo remains largely unknown. Using gene-trap approach we generated Lrwd1 knockout mice and examined the expression of Lrwd1 during embryonic development. We found that Lrwd1 is ubiquitously expressed in the majority of the developing mouse embryo. Depletion of LRWD1 did not affect embryonic development but the postnatal growth of the homozygous mutants is retarded. In vitro cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) depleted of LRWD1 displayed a reduced proliferation compared to wild type cells. We also showed that the knockout of Lrwd1 in MEFs increased the expression of the epigenetically silenced repetitive elements but with minimal effect on the expression of protein coding genes. Together, these results suggest that LRWD1 plays an important, but not essential, role in postnatal development by regulating cell proliferation likely through modulating DNA replication.",

        "Abstract": "Side effects of the use of opioid analgesics during painless delivery are the main factors that affect rapid postpartum recovery. Opioid use can result in dangerous respiratory depression in the patient. Opioids can also disrupt the baby's breathing and heart rate. The nonopioid analgesic dexmedetomidine, a new a2-adrenergic agonist, possesses higher selectivity, greater analgesic effects, and fewer side effects. Moreover, epidural administration of dexmedetomidine also reduces local anesthetic consumption.",

        "Abstract": "Characterization and prediction of individual difference of pain sensitivity are of great importance in clinical practice. MRI techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), have been popularly used to predict an individual's pain sensitivity, but existing studies are limited by using one single imaging modality (fMRI or DTI) and/or using one type of metrics (regional or connectivity features). As a result, pain-relevant information in MRI has not been fully revealed and the associations among different imaging modalities and different features have not been fully explored for elucidating pain sensitivity. In this study, we investigated the predictive capability of multi-features (regional and connectivity metrics) of multimodal MRI (fMRI and DTI) in the prediction of pain sensitivity using data from 210 healthy subjects. We found that fusing fMRI-DTI and regional-connectivity features are capable of more accurately predicting an individual's pain sensitivity than only using one type of feature or using one imaging modality. These results revealed rich information regarding individual pain sensitivity from the brain's both structural and functional perspectives as well as from both regional and connectivity metrics. Hence, this study provided a more comprehensive characterization of the neural correlates of individual pain sensitivity, which holds a great potential for clinical pain management.",

        "Abstract": "All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) have drawn growing attention and achieved tremendous progress recently, but their power conversion efficiency (PCE) still lags behind small-molecule-acceptor (SMA)-based PSCs due to the relative difficulty on morphology control of polymer photoactive blends. Here, low-cost PTQ10 is introduced as a second polymer donor (a third component) into the PM6:PY-IT blend to finely tune the energy-level matching and microscopic morphology of the polymer blend photoactive layer. The addition of PTQ10 decreases the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking distance, and increases the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking coherence length and the ordered face-on molecular packing orientation, which improves the charge separation and transport in the photoactive layer. Moreover, the deeper highest occupied molecular orbital energy level of the PTQ10 polymer donor than PM6 leads to higher open-circuit voltage of the ternary all-PSCs. As a result, a PCE of 16.52% is achieved for ternary all-PSCs, which is one of the highest PCEs for all-PSCs. In addition, the ternary devices exhibit a high tolerance of the photoactive layer thickness with high PCEs of 15.27% and 13.91% at photoactive layer thickness of \u2248205 and \u2248306\u00a0nm, respectively, which are the highest PCEs so far for all-PSCs with a thick photoactive layer.",

        "Abstract": "Liver fibrosis is a key transformation stage and also a reversible pathological process in various types of chronic liver diseases. However, the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis still remains elusive. Here, we report that the calcium binding protein A11 (S100A11) is consistently upregulated in the integrated data from GSE liver fibrosis and tree shrew liver proteomics. S100A11 is also experimentally activated in liver fibrosis in mouse, rat, tree shrew, and human with liver fibrosis. While overexpression of S100A11 in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro exacerbates liver fibrosis, the inhibition of S100A11 improves liver fibrosis. Mechanistically, S100A11 activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and the fibrogenesis process via the regulation of the deacetylation of Smad3 in the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. S100A11 physically interacts with SIRT6, a deacetylase of Smad2/3, which may competitively inhibit the interaction between SIRT6 and Smad2/3. The subsequent release and activation of Smad2/3 promote the activation of HSCs and fibrogenesis. Additionally, a significant elevation of S100A11 in serum is observed in clinical patients. Our study uncovers S100A11 as a novel profibrogenic factor in liver fibrosis, which may represent both a potential biomarker and a promising therapy target for treating liver fibrosis and fibrosis-related liver diseases.",

        "Title": "Microstate Detection in Naturalistic Electroencephalography Data: A Systematic Comparison of Topographical Clustering Strategies on an Emotional Database.",
        "Abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) microstate analysis is a powerful tool to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of human brain activity, through analyzing the quasi-stable states in EEG signals. However, current studies mainly focus on rest-state EEG recordings, microstate analysis for the recording of EEG signals during naturalistic tasks is limited. It remains an open question whether current topographical clustering strategies for rest-state microstate analysis could be directly applied to task-state EEG data under the natural and dynamic conditions and whether stable and reliable results could still be achieved. It is necessary to answer the question and explore whether the topographical clustering strategies would affect the performance of microstate detection in task-state EEG microstate analysis. If it exists differences in microstate detection performance when different topographical clustering strategies are adopted, then we want to know how the alternations of the topographical clustering strategies are associated with the naturalistic task. To answer these questions, we work on a public emotion database using naturalistic and dynamic music videos as the stimulation to evaluate the effects of different topographical clustering strategies for task-state EEG microstate analysis. The performance results are systematically examined and compared in terms of microstate quality, task efficacy, and computational efficiency, and the impact of topographical clustering strategies on microstate analysis for naturalistic task data is discussed. The results reveal that a single-trial-based bottom-up topographical clustering strategy (bottom-up) achieves comparable results with the task-driven-based top-down topographical clustering (top-down). It suggests that, when task information is unknown, the single-trial-based topographical clustering could be a good choice for microstate analysis and neural activity study on naturalistic EEG data.",

        "Abstract": "Transgenic technology can transfer favorable traits regardless of reproductive isolation and is an important method in plant synthetic biology and genetic improvement. Complex metabolic pathway modification and pyramiding breeding strategies often require the introduction of multiple genes at once, but the current vector assembly systems for constructing multigene expression cassettes are not completely satisfactory. In this study, a new in vitro gene stacking system, GuanNan Stacking (GNS), was developed. Through the introduction of Type IIS restriction enzyme-mediated Golden Gate cloning, GNS allows the modular, standardized assembly of target gene expression cassettes. Because of the introduction of Gateway recombination, GNS facilitates the cloning of superlarge transgene expression cassettes, allows multiple expression cassettes to be efficiently assembled in a binary vector simultaneously, and is compatible with the Cre enzyme-mediated marker deletion mechanism. The linked dual positive-negative marker selection strategy ensures the efficient acquisition of target recombinant plasmids without prokaryotic selection markers in the T-DNA region. The host-independent negative selection marker combined with the TAC backbone ensures the cloning and transfer of large T-DNAs (>100 kb). Using the GNS system, we constructed a binary vector containing five foreign gene expression cassettes and obtained transgenic rice carrying the target traits, proving that the method developed in this research is a powerful tool for plant metabolic engineering and compound trait transgenic breeding.",

The changes in air quality during the pandemic have been investigated in numerous studies via satellite observations. Nevertheless, no relevant research has been gathered using Chinese satellite instruments, because the poor spectral quality makes it extremely difficult to retrieve data from the spectra of the Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI), the first Chinese satellite-based ultraviolet-visible spectrometer monitoring air pollutants. However, through a series of remote sensing algorithm optimizations from spectral calibration to retrieval, we successfully retrieved global gaseous pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO",

        "Abstract": "Nucleosomes are disrupted transiently during eukaryotic transcription, yet the displaced histones must be retained and redeposited onto DNA, to preserve nucleosome density and associated histone modifications. Here, we show that the essential Spt5 processivity factor of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) plays a direct role in this process in budding yeast. Functional orthologues of eukaryotic Spt5 are present in archaea and bacteria, reflecting its universal role in RNA polymerase processivity. However, eukaryotic Spt5 is unique in having an acidic amino terminal tail (Spt5N) that is sandwiched between the downstream nucleosome and the upstream DNA that emerges from Pol II. We show that Spt5N contains a histone-binding motif that is required for viability in yeast cells and prevents loss of nucleosomal histones within actively transcribed regions. These findings indicate that eukaryotic Spt5 combines two essential activities, which together couple processive transcription to the efficient capture and re-deposition of nucleosomal histones.",

        "Abstract": "The dominant approach in investigating the individual reliability for event-related potentials (ERPs) is to extract peak-related features at electrodes showing the strongest group effects. Such a peak-based approach implicitly assumes ERP components showing a stronger group effect are also more reliable, but this assumption has not been substantially validated and few studies have investigated the reliability of ERPs beyond peaks. In this study, we performed a rigorous evaluation of the test-retest reliability of ERPs collected in a multisensory and cognitive experiment from 82 healthy adolescents, each having two sessions. By comparing group effects and individual reliability, we found that a stronger group-level response in ERPs did not guarantee higher reliability. A perspective of neural oscillation should be adopted for the analysis of reliability. Further, by simulating ERPs with an oscillation-based computational model, we found that the consistency between group-level ERP responses and individual reliability was modulated by inter-subject latency jitter and inter-trial variability. The current findings suggest that the conventional peak-based approach may underestimate the individual reliability in ERPs and a neural oscillation perspective on ERP reliability should be considered. Hence, a comprehensive evaluation of the reliability of ERP measurements should be considered in individual-level neurophysiological trait evaluation and psychiatric disorder diagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is a common complication of pregnancy that affects the physical and mental health of pregnant women, and approximately 50% of the mechanisms are unclear. Our previous studies have found that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) molecules are highly expressed at the maternal-fetal interface of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA) patients. The purpose of this study was to further detect the expression of HMGB1 and pyroptosis in decidual tissue of URSA patients, and explore the potential mechanism of the protective role of HMGB1 in URSA patients and mouse model. The decidua tissues of 75 URSA patients and 75 women who actively terminated pregnancy were collected, and URSA mouse models were established and treated with HMGB1 inhibitor-aspirin. The expression of HMGB1, and their receptors (RAGE, TLR2, TLR4), pyroptosis-associated proteins (NLRP-3, caspase-1, GSDMD) and NF-\u03baB was examined at the maternal-fetal interface of human and mouse. Our study found that HMGB1, NLRP-3, Caspase-1, GSDMD, RAGE, TLR2 and TLR4 were highly expressed and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway were activated in the decidua tissue of URSA group. Moreover, immune cell disorder and co-localization of HMGB1 and macrophages were found at the maternal-fetal interface of URSA mice. However, HMGB1, TLR2, TLR4, NF-\u03baB, and pyroptosis-associated proteins can be down-regulated by administering low-dose aspirin. These data may indicate that highly expressed HMGB1 was actively secreted by macrophages and then activated pyroptosis through the TLR2/TLR4-NF-\u03baB pathway to cause aseptic inflammation, leading to the occurrence and development of URSA. Moreover, low-dose aspirin can reduce HMGB1 protein levels of serum and decidual in URSA.",

        "Abstract": "Alpha band oscillations are the most prominent rhythmic oscillations in EEG, which are related to various types of mental diseases, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depression. However, the dynamics of alpha oscillations, especially how the endogenous alpha oscillations be entrained by exogenous stimulus, are still unclear. Recently, a newly-developed phase-locked visual feedback (PLVF) protocol has shown effectiveness in modulating alpha rhythm, which provides empirical evidence for the further investigation of the neural mechanism of alpha dynamics. In this work, extensive numerical simulations based on four well-studied models were used to investigate the questions that (1) What kind of dynamic model exhibits a modulation phenomenon of PLVF? (2) What is the dynamic mechanism of PLVF for alpha modulation? (3) Which factors affect the modulation effects in PLVF? The result indicates that the dynamics of endogenous alpha oscillations are close to a simpler dynamic structure, like fixed-point attractor or limit-cycle attractor, which shows a global consistent dynamic behavior at different phases of the alpha oscillation. The further analysis explains the dynamic mechanism of PLVF for amplitude and frequency modulation of the alpha rhythm, as well as the influence of parameter settings in the modulation. All these findings provide a deeper understanding of the endogenous alpha oscillations entrained by exogenous phased locked visual stimulus and lead in turn to the refinement of a control strategy for alpha modulation, which could potentially be used in developing new neural modulation methods for cognitive enhancement and mental diseases treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Intestinal iron absorption is activated during increased systemic demand for iron. The best-studied example is iron deficiency anemia, which increases intestinal iron absorption. Interestingly, the intestinal response to anemia is very similar to that of iron overload disorders, as both the conditions activate a transcriptional program that leads to a hyperabsorption of iron via the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 2\u03b1 (HIF2\u03b1). However, pathways for selective targeting of intestine-mediated iron overload remain unknown. Nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) is a critical cargo receptor for autophagic breakdown of ferritin and the subsequent release of iron, in a process termed ferritinophagy. Our work demonstrates that NCOA4-mediated intestinal ferritinophagy is integrated into systemic iron demand via HIF2\u03b1. To demonstrate the importance of the intestinal HIF2\u03b1/ferritinophagy axis in systemic iron homeostasis, whole-body and intestine-specific NCOA4-/- mouse lines were generated and assessed. The analyses revealed that the intestinal and systemic response to iron deficiency was not altered after disruption of intestinal NCOA4. However, in a mouse model of hemochromatosis, ablation of intestinal NCOA4 was protective against iron overload. Therefore, NCOA4 can be selectively targeted for the management of iron overload disorders without disrupting the physiological processes involved in the response to systemic iron deficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Machine learning has been applied to neuroimaging data for estimating brain age and capturing early cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative diseases. Blood parameters like neurofilament light chain are associated with aging. In order to improve brain age predictive accuracy, we constructed a model based on both brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and blood parameters. Healthy subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a093; 37 males; aged 50-85\u2009years) were recruited. A deep learning network was firstly pretrained on a large set of MRI scans (n\u00a0=\u00a01,481; 659 males; aged 50-85\u2009years) downloaded from multiple open-source datasets, to provide weights on our recruited dataset. Evaluating the network on the recruited dataset resulted in mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.91\u2009years and a high correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a0.67, p <.001) against chronological age. The sMRI data were then combined with five blood biochemical indicators including GLU, TG, TC, ApoA1 and ApoB, and 9 dementia-associated biomarkers including ApoE genotype, HCY, NFL, TREM2, A\u03b240, A\u03b242, T-tau, TIMP1, and VLDLR to construct a bilinear fusion model, which achieved a more accurate prediction of brain age (MAE, 3.96\u2009years; r\u00a0=\u00a0.76, p <.001). Notably, the fusion model achieved better improvement in the group of older subjects (70-85\u2009years). Extracted attention maps of the network showed that amygdala, pallidum, and olfactory were effective for age estimation. Mediation analysis further showed that brain structural features and blood parameters provided independent and significant impact. The constructed age prediction model may have promising potential in evaluation of brain health based on MRI and blood parameters.",

Here, we conducted a follow-up study of 29 naive TB patients who received first-line anti-TB drug treatment; we collected their fecal samples at different time points, as well as 22 fecal samples from healthy subjects. Fungal ITS2 and bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing were used to analyze the effects of active TB and anti-TB treatment on the gut microbiota. We found that naive TB patients had bacterial and fungal dysbiosis with altered community composition and a decreased density of the transkingdom correlation network. Anti-TB drug treatment significantly decreased the diversity of bacteria and fungi with altered composition. Notably, we observed that the abundance of Purpureocillium lilacinum tended to decrease and ",

        "Abstract": "The purpose is to explore the brain's structural difference in local morphology and between-region networks between two types of peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP): postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and lower back pain (LBP). A total of 54 participants including 38 LBP and 16 PHN patients were enrolled. The average pain scores were 7.6 and 7.5 for LBP and PHN. High-resolution structural T1 weighted images were obtained. Both grey matter volume (GMV) and morphological connectivity (MC) were extracted. An independent two-sample t-test with false discovery rate (FDR) correction was used to identify the brain regions where LBP and PHN patients showed significant GMV difference. Next, we explored the differences of MC network between LBP and PHN patients and detected the group differences in network properties by using the two-sample t-test and FDR correction. Compared with PHN, LBP patients had significantly larger GMV in temporal gyrus, insula and fusiform gyrus (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The LBP cohort had significantly stronger MC in the connection between right precuneus and left opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus (p\u2009<\u20090.05). LBP patients had significantly stronger degree in left anterior cingulate gyrus and left rectus gyrus (p\u2009<\u20090.05) while had significantly weaker degree than PHN patients in left orbital part of middle frontal gyrus, left supplementary motor area and left superior parietal lobule (p\u2009<\u20090.05). LBP and PHN patients had significant differences in the brain's GMV, MC, and network properties, which implies that different PNPs have different neural mechanisms concerning pain modulation.",

        "Abstract": "Conventional ovarian tissue cryopreservation often destroys the structural, functional, and DNA integrity of the ovarian tissue. How to effectively retain the ultrastructure and subsequent function of ovarian tissue during cryopreservation has long been an issue of concern. Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are a class of highly hydrophilic proteins and have been reported to protect various cells from water stress. However, whether LEA proteins exert protective effects on ovarian tissue cryopreservation remains unknown. To investigate the benefit of LEA proteins in ovarian tissue cryopreservation, we purified the recombinant AavLEA1 protein, a member of Group 3 LEA proteins, then cryopreserved the mouse ovaries with this protein by vitrification, and obtained the ovarian follicle structure, cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and GAPDH gene expression of postcryopreservation ovaries. We found that recombinant AavLEA1 protein protected the ovarian follicles from cryoinjury, improved the proliferative ability of follicles, decreased the apoptosis, and promoted the GAPDH gene expression. These results indicated that the LEA protein enhanced the antiapoptosis ability of ovarian cells and retained DNA/RNA integrity against cryoinjury during ovarian tissue vitrification. LEA proteins exert beneficial effects on ovarian tissue cryopreservation, and maybe provide a novel cryoprotective agent for ovarian tissue cryopreservation.",

        "Title": "Characterization of whole-brain task-modulated functional connectivity in response to nociceptive pain: A multisensory comparison study.",
        "Abstract": "Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that brain responses to nociceptive pain, non-nociceptive somatosensory, visual, and auditory stimuli are extremely similar. Actually, perception of external sensory stimulation requires complex interactions among distributed cortical and subcortical brain regions. However, the interactions among these regions elicited by nociceptive pain remain unclear, which limits our understanding of mechanisms of pain from a brain network perspective. Task fMRI data were collected with a random sequence of intermixed stimuli of four sensory modalities in 80 healthy subjects. Whole-brain psychophysiological interaction analysis was performed to identify task-modulated functional connectivity (FC) patterns for each modality. Task-modulated FC strength and graph-theoretical-based network properties were compared among the four modalities. Lastly, we performed across-sensory-modality prediction analysis based on the whole-brain task-modulated FC patterns to confirm the specific relationship between brain patterns and sensory modalities. For each sensory modality, task-modulated FC patterns were distributed over widespread brain regions beyond those typically activated or deactivated during the stimulation. As compared with the other three sensory modalities, nociceptive stimulation exhibited significantly different patterns (more widespread and stronger FC within the cingulo-opercular network, between cingulo-opercular and sensorimotor networks, between cingulo-opercular and emotional networks, and between default mode and emotional networks) and global property (smaller modularity). Further, a cross-sensory-modality prediction analysis found that task-modulated FC patterns could predict sensory modality at the subject level successfully. Collectively, these results demonstrated that the whole-brain task-modulated FC is preferentially modulated by pain, thus providing new insights into the neural mechanisms of pain processing.",

        "Title": "Plasma membrane-localized SEM1 protein mediates sugar movement to sink rice tissues.",
        "Abstract": "The translocation of photosynthate carbohydrates, such as sucrose, is critical for plant growth and crop yield. Previous studies have revealed that sugar transporters, plasmodesmata and sieve plates act as important controllers in sucrose loading into and unloading from phloem in the vascular system. However, other pivotal steps for the regulation of sucrose movement remain largely elusive. In this study, characterization of two starch excesses in mesophyll (sem) mutants and dye and sucrose export assays were performed to provide insights into the regulatory networks that drive source-sink relations in rice. Map-based cloning identified two allelic mutations in a gene encoding a GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE (GSL) protein, thus indicating a role for SEM1 in callose biosynthesis. Subcellular localization in rice showed that SEM1 localized to the plasma membrane. In situ expression analysis and GUS staining showed that SEM1 was mainly expressed in vascular phloem cells. Reduced sucrose transport was found in the sem1-1/1-2 mutant, which led to excessive starch accumulation in source leaves and inhibited photosynthesis. Paraffin section and transmission electron microscopy experiments revealed that less-developed vascular cells (VCs) in sem1-1/1-2 potentially disturbed sugar movement. Moreover, dye and sugar trafficking experiments revealed that aberrant VC development was the main reason for the pleiotropic phenotype of sem1-1/1-2. In total, efficient sucrose loading into the phloem benefits from an optional number of VCs with a large vacuole that could act as a buffer holding tank for sucrose passing from the vascular bundle sheath.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial dynamics (fission and fusion) are essential physiological processes for mitochondrial metabolic function, mitochondrial redistribution, and mitochondrial quality control. Various proteins are involved in regulating mitochondrial dynamics. Aberrant expression of these proteins interferes with mitochondrial dynamics and induces a range of diseases. Multiple therapeutic approaches have been developed to treat the related diseases in recent years, but their curative effects are limited. Meanwhile, the role of mitochondrial dynamics in female reproductive function has attracted progressively more attention, including oocyte development and maturation, fertilization, and embryonic development. Here, we reviewed the significance of mitochondrial dynamics, proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics, and disorders resulting from primary mitochondrial dynamic dysfunction. We summarized the latest therapeutic approaches of hereditary mitochondrial fusion-fission abnormalities and reviewed the recent advances in female reproductive mitochondrial dynamics.",

        "Title": "An unexpected role for Dicer as a reader of the unacetylated DNA binding domain of p53 in transcriptional regulation.",
        "Abstract": "Here, we identified Dicer as a major cellular factor that recognizes the DNA binding domain (DBD) of p53 in a manner dependent on its acetylation status. Upon binding the unacetylated DBD, Dicer is recruited to the promoters of p53 target genes, where it represses p53-mediated transcriptional activation. Conversely, knockdown or knockout of endogenous Dicer leads to up-regulation of p53-mediated transcriptional activation without increasing its protein levels. Moreover, Dicer-mediated repression is independent of its intrinsic endoribonuclease activity; instead, Dicer directly represses transcription by recruiting the SUV39H1 histone methyltransferase. However, upon DNA damage, Dicer-mediated repression is abrogated by stress-induced acetylation at the DBD of p53. Notably, the inability of acetylation-defective p53-3KR in transcription is partially but significantly restored upon loss of Dicer expression. Our study reveals that Dicer acts as an unexpected acetylation \u201creader\u201d for p53 and thus has important implications regarding the mechanism of acetylation-mediated regulation of p53 transcriptional program.",

However, the black-box nature of NN makes it difficult to interpret or analyze why and how NNs work during execution. In this paper, we propose a cause-aware failure detection scheme for optical transport network (OTN) boards, adopting the interpretable extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. According to the feature importance ranking by XGBoost, the high-relevance features with the equipment failure are found. Then, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is applied to solve the inconsistency of feature attribution under three common global feature importance measurement parameters of XGBoost, and can obtain a consistent feature attribution by calculating the contribution (SHAP value) of each input feature to detection result of XGBoost. Based on the feature importance ranking of SHAP values, the features most related to two types of OTN board failures are confirmed, enabling the identification of failure causes. Moreover, we evaluate the failure detection performance for two types of OTN boards, in which the practical data are balanced and unbalanced respectively. Experimental results show that the F1 score of the two types of OTN boards based on the proposed scheme is higher than 98%, and the most relevant features of the two types of board failures are confirmed based on SHAP value, which are the average and maximum values of the environment temperature, respectively.",

        "Title": "Auto-weighted centralised multi-task learning via integrating functional and structural connectivity for subjective cognitive decline diagnosis.",
        "Abstract": "Early diagnosis and intervention of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its early stage (i.e., subjective cognitive decline (SCD)) is able to delay or reverse the disease progression. However, discrimination between SCD, MCI and healthy subjects accurately remains challenging. This paper proposes an auto-weighted centralised multi-task (AWCMT) learning framework for differential diagnosis of SCD and MCI. AWCMT is based on structural and functional connectivity information inferred from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To be specific, we devise a novel multi-task learning algorithm to combine neuroimaging functional and structural connective information. We construct a functional brain network through a sparse and low-rank machine learning method, and also a structural brain network via fibre bundle tracking. Those two networks are constructed separately and independently. Multi-task learning is then used to identify features integration of functional and structural connectivity. Hence, we can learn each task's significance automatically in a balanced way. By combining the functional and structural information, the most informative features of SCD and MCI are obtained for diagnosis. The extensive experiments on the public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm obtains better performance in classifying SCD, MCI and healthy people than traditional algorithms. The newly proposed method has good interpretability as it is able to discover the most disease-related brain regions and their connectivity. The results agree well with current clinical findings and provide new insights into early AD detection based on the multi-modal neuroimaging technique.",

The effects of different sources of manure on soil physical and chemical indicators and bacterial abundance under simulated leaching conditions were studied, while the migration of tetracyclines in the different treatments were also determined. The results showed that compared with the CHM-T and CM-T treatments, the tetracyclines in the PM-T treatment were more easily accumulated in the soil(residual amounts=0.90-6.91 mg\u00b7kg",

        "Abstract": "Drug-induced hepatotoxicity limits development of new effective medications. Drugs and numerous endogenous/exogenous agents are metabolized/detoxified by hepatocytes, during which reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated as a by-product. ROS has broad adverse effects on liver function and integrity, including damaging hepatocyte proteins, lipids, and DNA and promoting liver inflammation and fibrosis. ROS in concert with iron overload drives ferroptosis. Hepatic nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB)-inducing kinase (NIK) is aberrantly activated in a broad spectrum of liver disease. NIK phosphorylates and activates inhibitor of NF-\u03baB kinase subunit alpha (IKK\u03b1), and the hepatic NIK/IKK\u03b1 cascade suppresses liver regeneration. However, the NIK/IKK\u03b1 pathway has not been explored in drug-induced liver injury. Here, we identify hepatic NIK as a previously unrecognized mediator for acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver failure. APAP treatment increased both NIK transcription and NIK protein stability in primary hepatocytes as well as in liver in mice. Hepatocyte-specific overexpression of NIK augmented APAP-induced liver oxidative stress in mice and increased hepatocyte death and mortality in a ROS-dependent manner. Conversely, hepatocyte-specific ablation of NIK or IKK\u03b1 mitigated APAP-elicited hepatotoxicity and mortality. NIK increased lipid peroxidation and cell death in APAP-stimulated primary hepatocytes. Pretreatment with antioxidants or ferroptosis inhibitors blocked NIK/APAP-induced hepatocyte death. Conclusion: We unravel a previously unrecognized NIK/IKK\u03b1/ROS/ferroptosis axis engaged in liver disease progression.",

        "Abstract": "How to effectively and efficiently extract valid and reliable features from high-dimensional electroencephalography (EEG), particularly how to fuse the spatial and temporal dynamic brain information into a better feature representation, is a critical issue in brain data analysis. Most current EEG studies work in a task driven manner and explore the valid EEG features with a supervised model, which would be limited by the given labels to a great extent. In this paper, we propose a practical hybrid unsupervised deep convolutional recurrent generative adversarial network based EEG feature characterization and fusion model, which is termed as EEGFuseNet. EEGFuseNet is trained in an unsupervised manner, and deep EEG features covering both spatial and temporal dynamics are automatically characterized. Comparing to the existing features, the characterized deep EEG features could be considered to be more generic and independent of any specific EEG task. The performance of the extracted deep and low-dimensional features by EEGFuseNet is carefully evaluated in an unsupervised emotion recognition application based on three public emotion databases. The results demonstrate the proposed EEGFuseNet is a robust and reliable model, which is easy to train and performs efficiently in the representation and fusion of dynamic EEG features. In particular, EEGFuseNet is established as an optimal unsupervised fusion model with promising cross-subject emotion recognition performance. It proves EEGFuseNet is capable of characterizing and fusing deep features that imply comparative cortical dynamic significance corresponding to the changing of different emotion states, and also demonstrates the possibility of realizing EEG based cross-subject emotion recognition in a pure unsupervised manner.",

        "Abstract": "Electroencephalographic (EEG) neurofeedback (NFB) is a popular neuromodulation method to help one selectively enhance or inhibit his/her brain activities by means of real-time visual or auditory feedback of EEG signals. Sensory motor rhythm (SMR) NFB protocol has been applied to improve cognitive performance, but a large proportion of participants failed to self-regulate their brain activities and could not benefit from NFB training. Therefore, it is important to identify the neural predictors of SMR up-regulation NFB training performance for a better understanding the mechanisms of individual difference in SMR NFB. Twenty-seven healthy participants (12 males, age: 23.1 \u00b1 2.36) were enrolled to complete three sessions of SMR up-regulation NFB training and collection of multimodal neuroimaging data [resting-state EEG, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI)]. Correlation analyses were performed between within-session NFB learning index and anatomical and functional brain features extracted from multimodal neuroimaging data, in order to identify the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological predictors for NFB learning performance. Lastly, machine learning models were trained to predict NFB learning performance using features from each modality as well as multimodal features. According to our results, most participants were able to successfully increase the SMR power and the NFB learning performance was significantly correlated with a set of neuroimaging features, including resting-state EEG powers, gray/white matter volumes from MRI, regional and functional connectivity (FC) of resting-state fMRI. Importantly, results of prediction analysis indicate that NFB learning index can be better predicted using multimodal features compared with features of single modality. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of multimodal neuroimaging technique as a tool to explain the individual difference in within-session NFB learning performance, and could provide a theoretical framework for early identification of individuals who cannot benefit from NFB training.",

        "Abstract": "There is growing interest in developing triplet photosensitizers in terms of implementing photochemical strategies in synthetic chemistry. However, synthesis of stable triplet organic photosensitizers is nontrivial and often requires the use of heavy atoms. Herein, an alternative strategy is demonstrated to enhance the triplet generation efficiency by implanting lone-pair donor-acceptor bonds in the conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This powerful method is validated using COFs that host triazine, a moiety that has been extensively investigated in photocatalysis. Spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations reveal substantial improvements in the photoabsorptivity and triple-state photogeneration efficiency, consistent with catalytic tests concerning industrially relevant sulfide oxidation. These systems represent a promising addition to the rapidly increasing arsenal of synthetic photocatalytic systems.",

        "Abstract": "Coexistence and cooperation between dogs and humans over thousands of years have supported convergent evolutionary processes in the two species. Previous studies found that Eurasian dogs evolved into a distinct geographic cluster. In this study, we used the genomes of 242 European dogs, 38 Southeast Asian indigenous (SEAI) dogs, and 41 gray wolves to identify adaptation of European dogs . We report 86 unique positively selected genes in European dogs, among which is LCT (lactase). LCT encodes lactase, which is fundamental for the digestion of lactose. We found that an A-to-G mutation (chr19:38,609,592) is almost fixed in Middle Eastern and European dogs. The results of two-dimensional site frequency spectrum (2D SFS) support that the mutation is under soft sweep . We inferred that the onset of positive selection of the mutation is shorter than 6,535\u2009years and behind the well-developed dairy economy in central Europe. It increases the expression of LCT by reducing its binding with ZEB1, which would enhance dog's ability to digest milk-based diets. Our study uncovers the genetic basis of convergent evolution between humans and dogs with respect to diet, emphasizing the import of the dog as a biomedical model for studying mechanisms of the digestive system.",

        "Abstract": "Theta oscillations over the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) and lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) play vital roles in sustained attention. Specifically, pMFC power and pMFC-LPFC synchronization correlate with cognitive control in sustained-attention-related tasks, but the causal relationships remain unknown. In the present study, we first analyzed the correlation between EEG theta oscillations (characterized by time-frequency power and phase-based connectivity) and the level of sustained attention (Experiment 1) and then utilized transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to modulate theta oscillations and in turn observed its effects on sustained attention (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, two time-frequency regions of interest (ROIs) were determined, in which high/low time-frequency power and high/low phase-based connectivity corresponded to high/low-level sustained attention. In Experiment 2, time-frequency power and phase-based connectivity of theta oscillations were compared between the sham and tACS groups within the time-frequency ROIs determined in Experiment 1. Results showed that phase-based connectivity between pMFC and LPFC significantly decreased in the tACS group compared with the sham group during the first five minutes of the poststimulation period. Moreover, a marginal trend existed that sustained attention was downregulated by tACS in the same time interval, suggesting that theta phase synchronization between pMFC and LPFC may play a causal role in sustained attention.",

        "Abstract": "The present study discussed the optimization of the ultrasonic-assisted extraction of polysaccharides from daylily polysaccharides (DPs). The extracted crude polysaccharides were further separated and purified, and the antioxidant activities including 1,1-diphenyl-2-111 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) radical scavenging, hydroxyl radical scavenging, and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) activities of the obtained fractions were also evaluated. The results showed that the optimal ultrasonic-assisted extraction parameters with DPs yield of 15.25 \u00b1 1.13% were water to powder ratio of 25 ml/g, extraction power of 694 W, extraction temperature of 71\u00b0C, extraction time of 38 min, and three times extraction. By DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column, four water-soluble polysaccharide fractions (DP-1, DP-2, DP-3, and DP-4) were successfully obtained. Monosaccharide component analysis showed that the four obtained fractions were all hetero-polysaccharides that mainly contained rhamnose, arabinose, fructose, galactose, glucose, galacturonic acid, and glucuronic acid in different molar ratios. All the four DP fractions did show obvious antioxidant activities in vitro, and the DP-3 component had relatively high ABTS free radical scavenging activity. Overall, our research showed that DPs could provide cheap raw materials for the development of natural antioxidants in medicines, functional foods, and even cosmetics. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This article deals with the optimization of the ultrasonic-assisted extraction of polysaccharides from daylily and its antioxidant activities. The results showed that the optimal ultrasonic-assisted extraction yield of DPs was 15.25 \u00b1 1.13%. By DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column, four water-soluble polysaccharide fractions were successfully obtained, and all the four DP fractions did show obvious antioxidant activities in vitro. Daylily polysaccharides could provide cheap raw materials for the development of natural antioxidants in medicines, functional foods, and even cosmetics.",

        "Abstract": "Oncogenic histone lysine-to-methionine mutations block the methylation of their corresponding lysine residues on wild-type histones. One attractive model is that these mutations sequester histone methyltransferases, but genome-wide studies show that mutant histones and histone methyltransferases often do not colocalize. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), here, we show that, in fission yeast, even though H3K9M-containing nucleosomes are broadly distributed across the genome, the histone H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 is mainly sequestered at pericentric repeats. This selective sequestration of Clr4 depends not only on H3K9M but also on H3K14 ubiquitylation (H3K14ub), a modification deposited by a Clr4-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In\u00a0vitro, H3K14ub synergizes with H3K9M to interact with Clr4 and potentiates the inhibitory effects of H3K9M on Clr4 enzymatic activity. Moreover, binding kinetics show that H3K14ub overcomes the Clr4 aversion to H3K9M and reduces its dissociation. The selective sequestration model reconciles previous discrepancies and demonstrates the importance of protein-interaction kinetics in regulating biological processes.",

        "Abstract": "The level of immunoglobulin M (IgM) displayed on the surface of peripheral blood B cells exhibits a broad dynamic range and has been associated with both development and selection. To determine whether IgM surface expression associates with distinct immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IGH) repertoire properties, we performed deep IgM sequencing of peripheral blood transitional and mature na\u00efve B cells in the upper and lower quartiles of surface IgM expression for 12 healthy donors. Mature na\u00efve B cells within the lowest quartile for surface IgM expression displayed more diverse IGH features including increased complementarity-determining region 3 length, IGHJ6 segment usage and aromatic amino acids compared with mature na\u00efve B cells with high surface IgM. There were no differences between IGH repertoires for transitional B cells with high or low surface IgM. These findings suggest that a selection checkpoint during progression of transitional to mature na\u00efve B cells reduces the breadth of the IGH repertoire among high surface IgM B cells but that diversity is preserved in B cells expressing low levels of surface IgM.",

        "Abstract": "The existence of nociceptive-specific brain regions has been a controversial issue for decades. Multisensory fMRI studies, which examine fMRI activities in response to various types of sensory stimulation, could help identify nociceptive-specific brain regions, but previous studies are limited by sample size and they did not differentiate nociceptive-specific regions and nociceptive-preferential regions, which have significantly larger responses to nociceptive input. In this study, we conducted a multisensory fMRI experiment on 80 healthy participants, with the aim to determine whether there are certain brain regions that specifically or preferentially respond to nociceptive stimulation. By comparing the evoked fMRI responses across four sensory modalities, we found a series of brain regions specifically or preferentially involved in nociceptive sensory input. Particularly, we found different parts of some cortical regions, such as insula and cingulate gyrus, play different functional roles in the processing of nociceptive stimulation. Hence, this multisensory study improves our understanding of the functional integrations and segregations of the nociceptive-related regions.",

        "Title": "Efficient and strand-specific profiling of replicating chromatin with enrichment and sequencing of protein-associated nascent DNA in mammalian cells.",
        "Abstract": "Faithful duplication of both genetic and epigenetic information is essential for all eukaryotic cells. DNA replication initiates from replication origins and proceeds bidirectionally but asymmetrically, with the leading strand being synthesized continuously and the lagging strand discontinuously as Okazaki fragments by distinct DNA polymerases. Unraveling the underlying mechanisms of chromatin replication at both strands is crucial to better understand DNA replication and its coupled processes, including nucleosome assembly, sister chromatid cohesion and DNA mismatch repair. Here we describe the enrichment and sequencing of protein-associated nascent DNA (eSPAN) method to analyze the enrichment of proteins of interest, including histones and their modifications at replicating chromatin in a strand-specific manner in mammalian cells. Briefly, cells are pulsed with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine to label newly synthesized DNA. After cell permeabilization, the target proteins are sequentially bound by antibodies and protein A-fused transposase, which digests and tags genomic DNA of interest once activated by magnesium. The strand specificity is preserved through oligo-replacement. Finally, the resulting double-strand DNA is denatured and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against bromodeoxyuridine to enrich nascent DNA associated with proteins of interest. After PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing, the mapped reads are used to calculate the relative enrichment of the target proteins around replication origins. Compared with alternative methods, the eSPAN protocol is simple, cost-effective and sensitive, even in a relatively small number of mammalian cells. The whole procedures from cell collection to generation of sequencing-ready libraries can be completed in 2 days.",

        "Title": "Melatonin alleviates deoxynivalenol-induced apoptosis of human granulosa cells by reducing mutually accentuated FOXO1 and ER stress\u2021.",
        "Abstract": "Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the most prevalent Fusarium mycotoxins, which cause detrimental effects on human and animal reproductive systems by inducing oxidative stress. Increasing evidence has suggested the potential roles of melatonin in protecting granulosa cells from oxidative injury, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we demonstrated that suppression of FOXO1 and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was engaged in melatonin-mediated protection against oxidative damage in human granulosa cells upon DON exposure in vitro. DON induced excess reactive oxygen species accumulation, cells viability loss, reduced estradiol-17\u03b2, and progesterone production in human granulosa cells, whereas melatonin ameliorated these phenotypes. Next, we found that the protective effect of melatonin against apoptosis was via reducing ER stress because the inhibition of ER stress displayed similar protective effects during DON treatment. Moreover, melatonin provided no additional protection when ER stress was inhibited. We further found that FOXO1 is a pivotal downstream effector of melatonin and ER stress in regulating DON-induced apoptosis in human granulosa cells. Blocking of FOXO1 reduced DON-induced cells death and FOXO1 activation could be suppressed by melatonin or ER stress inhibitor. However, melatonin failed to further restore cells viability in the presence of FOXO1 inhibitor. Collectively, our results reveal a new mechanism of melatonin in protecting against DON-induced apoptosis and dysfunction by suppressing ER stress and FOXO1 in human granulosa cells.",

The current knowledge of the processes at work in long-term phytoremediation by woody species remains insufficient. Through a 4-year field study, we evaluated the phytoextraction efficiency of Populus deltoides CL. 'Xianglin 90' grown on a mine tailing co-polluted by Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn. The concentrations of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in the rhizospheric soil were reduced by amounts ranging from 12.86 to 42.19% during the study period. Bioconcentration factors and translocation factors showed that the accumulation of Cd and Zn occurring in the shoots was the most effective. Combined with the considerable biomass produced by poplar, the extracted amounts of Cd and Zn could reach 0.61 g and 10.66 g plant",

        "Abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are endogenous noncoding RNAs with unique cyclic structures. Although they were previously considered as nonfunctional transcription byproducts, numerous studies have demonstrated that circRNAs regulate gene transcription and expression via different mechanisms. Reproductive health influences the quality of life and affects offspring propagation in women. CircRNAs have been found to modify pregnancy-related diseases, gynecologic cancers, polycystic ovary syndrome, aging, gamete, and embryo development. It's promising for circRNAs to be the novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for multiple reproductive diseases. With the widespread application of assisted reproduction technology (ART), it has been revealed that circRNA identification contributes to estimating the quality of gametes and embryos, reflecting the success rate of ART. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology has enabled the discovery of new roles of circRNAs. So far, the roles of circRNAs in the reproductive system remain poorly defined. In this review, we describe the classification and functions of circRNAs in embryogenesis and the female reproductive system diseases, revealing potential roles of circRNAs physiologically and pathologically. In so-doing, we provide ideas for developing circRNA-based therapeutic treatment and clinical application of various female reproductive system diseases.",

However, the structural inhomogeneity of most polymers usually leads to random resistive switching characteristics, which lowers the production yield and reliability of nanoscale devices. In this contribution, we report that by adopting the two-dimensional conjugation strategy, a record high 90% production yield of polymer memristors has been achieved with miniaturization and low power potentials. By constructing coplanar macromolecules with 2D conjugated thiophene derivatives to enhance the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and crystallinity of the thin film, homogeneous switching takes place across the entire polymer layer, with fast responses in 32\u2009ns, D2D variation down to 3.16% ~ 8.29%, production yield approaching 90%, and scalability into 100\u2009nm scale with tiny power consumption of ~ 10",

        "Abstract": "Stroke has been the leading cause of adult morbidity and mortality over the past several years. After an ischemic stroke attack, many dormant or reversibly injured brain cells exist in the penumbra area. However, the pathological processes and unique cell information in the penumbra area of an acute ischemic stroke remain elusive. We applied unbiased single cell sequencing in combination with bulk RNA-seq analysis to investigate the heterogeneity of each cell type in the early stages of ischemic stroke and to detect early possible therapeutic targets to help cell survival. We used these analyses to study the mouse brain penumbra during this phase. Our results reveal the impact of ischemic stroke on specific genes and pathways of different cell types and the alterations of cell differentiation trajectories, suggesting potential pathological mechanisms and therapeutic targets. In addition to classical gene markers, single-cell genomics demonstrates unique information on subclusters of several cell types and metabolism changes in an ischemic stroke. These findings suggest that ",

        "Abstract": "Pain sensitivity is highly variable among individuals, and it is clinically important to predict an individual's pain sensitivity for individualized diagnosis and management of pain. Literature has shown that pain sensitivity is associated with regional structural features of the brain, but it remains unclear whether pain sensitivity is also related to structural brain connectivity. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between pain thresholds and morphological connectivity (MC) inferred from structural MRI based on data of 221 healthy participants. We found that MC was highly predictive of an individual's pain thresholds and, importantly, it had a better prediction performance than regional structural features. We also identified a number of most predictive MC features and confirmed the crucial role of the prefrontal cortex in the determination of pain sensitivity. These results suggest the potential of using structural MRI-based MC to predict an individual's pain sensitivity in clinical settings, and hence this study has important implications for diagnosis and treatment of pain.",

        "Title": "Enhanced control of sulfonamide resistance genes and host bacteria during thermophilic aerobic composting of cow manure.",
        "Abstract": "Traditional composting has already shown a certain effect in eliminating antibiotic residues, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARBs), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). It is worth noting that the rebounding of ARGs and the succession of the bacterial community during conventional aerobic composting are still serious threats. Considering the probable risk, improved and adaptable technologies are urgently needed to control antibiotic resistance efficiently. This study monitored how thermophilic aerobic composting affected the ARGs, as well as the bacterial diversity during the composting of cow manure spiked with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) at different concentrations. Results showed that the degradation of SMX was enhanced during thermophilic aerobic composting (control\u00a0>\u00a0SMX25\u00a0>\u00a0SMX50\u00a0>\u00a0SMX100) and was no longer detected after 20 days of composting. High temperature or heat significantly stimulated the rebounding of certain genes. After 35 days, the abundance of detected genes (sul2, sulA, dfrA7, and dfrA1) significantly decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in control and antibiotic-spiked treatments, except for sul1. The addition of three concentrations of SMX elicited a sharp effect on bacterial diversity, and microbial structure in SMX25 led to significant differences with others (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The network analysis revealed more rigorous interactions among ARGs and abundant genera, suggesting that the host of ARGs potentially increased at low concentrations of SMX. Especially, genera g_norank_f__Beggiatoaceae, Ruminiclostridium, Caldicoprobacter, g_norank_o_MBA03, Hydrogenispora, and Ruminiclostridium_1 were major potential hosts for sul1. In conclusion, the rebounding of ARGs could be intermitted partially, and more efficient control of antibiotic resistance could be achieved in the thermophilic composting compared to conventional methods.",

We previously demonstrated that sonodynamic therapy (SDT) inhibits atherosclerotic plaque progression. In this study, we investigated whether SDT could also be applied to treat more advanced hemorrhagic plaque and addressed the underlying mechanism. SDT decreased atherosclerotic burden, positively altered atherosclerotic lesion composition, and alleviated iron retention in rabbit hemorrhagic plaques. Furthermore, SDT reduced iron retention by stimulating ",

At present, the hull of the Nanhai No. 1 shipwreck is still being excavated, and a small part of the hull wood is soaked in a specific solution to desalt. Through long-term exploration, we found that the above two states of hull wood had undergone biodeterioration, so the purpose of this study is to analyze the fungal community of exposed and soaked wood from the Nanhai No. 1 shipwreck. We sampled 10 exposed hull wood and sea mud samples, two wood storage water samples, and air samples in the glass warehouse. We used scanning electron microscope and optical microscope to find that there were obvious fungal structures in exposed wood and wood storing water samples. High-throughput sequencing of fungi revealed that the most abundant genera in exposed and soaked wood were ",

At least 70 \u03b2-blockers have been investigated in history. However, only a few \u03b2-blockers, e.g., timolol, are clinically marketed as an optically pure enantiomer. Therefore, the separation of racemates of \u03b2-blockers is essential both in the laboratory and industry. Many approaches have been explored to obtain the single enantiomeric \u03b2-blocker, including high performance liquid chromatography, supercritical fluid chromatography and simulated moving bed chromatography. In this article, a review is presented on different chromatographic methods applied for the enantioseparation of \u03b2-blockers, covering high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and simulated moving bed chromatography (SMB).",

        "Abstract": "Separation of Xe and Kr is one of the greatest challenges in the gas industries owing to their close molecular structure and similar properties. Energy-effective adsorption-based separation using chemically stable carbon adsorbents is a promising technology. We propose a strategy for Xe/Kr separation using MOF-derived metallic carbon adsorbents. M-Gallate (M=Ni, Co) were used as precursors to fabricate CoNi alloy nanoparticles embedded carbon adsorbents by one-step auto-reduction pyrolysis. The optimal NiCo@C-700 exhibits record-high IAST selectivity (24.1) and Henry's selectivity (20.1) of Xe/Kr among reported carbon adsorbents. DFT calculations, local density of states calculation, charge density difference, and Bader charge analysis reveal the great affinity with Xe benefits from the presence of Ni or CoNi nanoparticles as a result of more charge transfer from Xe than Kr to metal, thus providing higher binding energy. Breakthrough experiments further verify NiCo@C-700 a promising candidate for Xe/Kr separation.",

        "Abstract": "Aberrant mechanical factor is one of the etiologies of the intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration (IVDD). However, the exact molecular mechanism of spinal mechanical loading stress-induced IVDD has yet to be elucidated due to a lack of an ideal and stable IVDD animal model. The present study aimed to establish a stable IVDD mouse model and evaluated the effect of aberrant spinal mechanical loading on the pathogenesis of IVDD. Eight-week-old male mice were treated with lumbar spine instability (LSI) surgery to induce IVDD. The progression of IVDD was evaluated by \u03bcCT and Safranin O/Fast green staining analysis. The metabolism of extracellular matrix, ingrowth of sensory nerves, pyroptosis in IVDs tissues were determined by immunohistological or real-time PCR analysis. The apoptosis of IVD cells was tested by TUNEL assay. IVDD modeling was successfully produced by LSI surgery, with substantial reductions in IVD height, BS/TV, Tb.N. and lower IVD score. LSI administration led to the histologic change of disc degeneration, disruption of the matrix metabolism, promotion of apoptosis of IVD cells and invasion of sensory nerves into annulus fibrosus, as well as induction of pyroptosis. Moreover, LSI surgery activated Wnt signaling in IVD tissues. Mechanical instability caused by LSI surgery accelerates the disc matrix degradation, nerve invasion, pyroptosis, and eventually lead to IVDD, which provided an alternative mouse IVDD model.",

        "Abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms that alter heritable gene expression and chromatin structure play an essential role in many biological processes, including liver function. Human MOF (males absent on the first) is a histone acetyltransferase that is globally downregulated in human steatohepatitis. However, the function of MOF in the liver remains unclear. Here, we report that MOF plays an essential role in adult liver. Genetic deletion of Mof by Mx1-Cre in the liver leads to acute liver injury, with increase of lipid deposition and fibrosis akin to human steatohepatitis. Surprisingly, hepatocyte-specific Mof deletion had no overt liver abnormality. Using the in\u00a0vitro coculturing experiment, we show that Mof deletion-induced liver injury requires coordinated changes and reciprocal signaling between hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, which enables feedforward regulation to augment inflammation and apoptotic responses. At the molecular level, Mof deletion induced characteristic changes in metabolic gene programs, which bore noticeable similarity to the molecular signature of human steatohepatitis. Simultaneous deletion of Mof in both hepatocytes and macrophages results in enhanced expression of inflammatory genes and NO signaling in\u00a0vitro. These changes, in turn, lead to apoptosis of hepatocytes and lipotoxicity. Our work highlights the importance of histone acetyltransferase MOF in maintaining metabolic liver homeostasis and sheds light on the epigenetic dysregulation in liver pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating disease. With the current treatment of surgery followed by chemoradiation, outcomes remain poor, with median survival of only 15 months and a 5-year survival rate of 6.8%. A challenge in treating GBM is the heterogeneous integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits the bioavailability of systemic therapies to the brain. There is a growing interest in enhancing drug delivery by opening the BBB with the use of focused ultrasound (FUS). We hypothesize that an FUS-mediated BBB opening can enhance the delivery of etoposide for a therapeutic benefit in GBM.",

        "Abstract": "Three-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are cutting-edge materials in the adsorptive removal of trace gases due to the availability of abundant pores with specific chemistry. However, the development of ideal adsorbents combining high adsorption capacity with high selectivity and stability remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a strategy to design adsorbents that utilizes the tunability of interlayer and intralayer space of two-dimensional fluorinated MOFs for capturing acetylene from ethylene. Validated by X-ray diffraction and modeling, a systematic variation of linker atom oxidation state enables fine regulation of layer stacking pattern and linker conformation, which affords a strong interlayer trapping of molecules along with cooperative intralayer binding. The resultant robust materials (ZUL-100 and ZUL-200) exhibit benchmark capacity in the pressure range of 0.001-0.05\u2009bar with high selectivity. Their efficiency in acetylene/ethylene separation is confirmed by breakthrough experiments, giving excellent ethylene productivities (121\u2009mmol/g from 1/99 mixture, 99.9999%), even when cycled under moist conditions.",

        "Abstract": "To understand the taste of the Ruditapes philippinarum, 14 novel umami peptides were isolated and identified by gel chromatography, HPLC and UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS. Separations were combined with sensory evaluations and electronic tongue determinations. The peptide sequences were GRVSNCAA, SEEK, KEMQKN, KSAEN, QIEELEGK, TDVEQEGD, HNESQN, RGEPNND, TGDPEK, KGGGGP, TYLPVH, PAATIPE, GPAGPAGPR and AGAGPTP. All peptides had umami and umami-enhancing qualities, KSAEN and QIEELEGK had higher sensory evaluation than the others, while PAATIPE and HNESQN had the best umami-enhancing taste in a 0.35% MSG solution. Molecular docking of the peptides with T1R1/T1R3 indicated that Ser123, Ser146 and Tyr143 may be important in the interaction of the peptides with T1R3. Arg303, Ser123 and Asp166 appear to be involved in the synergistic effect of umami peptides combined with monosodium glutamate. The omission test and the addition test confirmed that the 14 umami peptides contributed to the umami taste of R. philippinarum.",

        "Abstract": "By learning how the brain reacts to external visual stimuli and examining possible triggered brain statuses, we conduct a systematic study on an encoding problem that estimates ongoing EEG dynamics from visual information. A novel generalized system is proposed to encode the alpha oscillations modulated during video viewing by employing the visual saliency involved in the presented natural video stimuli. Focusing on the parietal and occipital lobes, the encoding effects at different alpha frequency bins and brain locations are examined by a real-valued genetic algorithm (GA), and possible links between alpha features and saliency patterns are constructed. The robustness and reliability of the proposed system are demonstrated in a 10-fold cross-validation. The results show that stimuli with different saliency levels can induce significant changes in occipito-parietal alpha oscillations and that alpha at higher frequency bins responded the most in involuntary attention related to bottom-up-based visual processing. This study provides a novel approach to understand the processing of involuntary attention in the brain dynamics and would further be beneficial to the development of brain-computer interfaces and visual design.",

        "Abstract": "In organic electronics, an aromatic fused ring is a basic unit that provides \u03c0-electrons to construct semiconductors and governs the device performance. The main challenge in developing new \u03c0-skeletons for tuning the material properties is the limitation of the available chemical approach. Herein, we successfully synthesize two pentacyclic siloxy-bridged \u03c0-conjugated isomers to investigate the synergistic effects of Si and O atoms on the geometric and electronic influence of \u03c0-units in organic electronics. Notably, the synthesis routes for both isomers possess several advantages over the previous approaches for delivering conventional aromatic fused-rings, such as environmentally benign tin-free synthesis and few synthetic steps. To explore their potential application as photovoltaic materials, two isomeric acceptor-donor-acceptor type acceptors based on these two isomers were developed, showing a decent device efficiency of 10%, which indicates the great potential of this SiO-bridged ladder-type unit for the development of new high-performance semiconductor materials.",

        "Abstract": "Ubiquitination, an essential post-transcriptional modification (PTM), plays a vital role in nearly every biological process, including development and growth. Despite its functions in plant reproductive development, its targets in rice panicles remain unclear. In this study, we used proteome-wide profiling of lysine ubiquitination in rice (O. sativa ssp. indica) young panicles. We created the largest ubiquitinome dataset in rice to date, identifying 1638 lysine ubiquitination sites on 916 unique proteins. We detected three conserved ubiquitination motifs, noting that acidic glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) were most frequently present around ubiquitinated lysine. Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of these ubiquitinated proteins revealed that ubiquitination plays an important role in fundamental cellular processes in rice young panicles. Interestingly, enrichment analysis of protein domains indicated that ubiquitination was enriched on a variety of receptor-like kinases and cytoplasmic tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. Furthermore, we analyzed the crosstalk between ubiquitination, acetylation, and succinylation, and constructed a potential protein interaction network within our rice ubiquitinome. Moreover, we identified ubiquitinated proteins related to pollen and grain development, indicating that ubiquitination may play a critical role in the physiological functions in young panicles. Taken together, we reported the most comprehensive lysine ubiquitinome in rice so far, and used it to reveal the functional role of lysine ubiquitination in rice young panicles.",

        "Abstract": "Using machine learning to predict the intensity of pain from fMRI has attracted rapidly increasing interests. However, due to remarkable inter- and intra-individual variabilities in pain responses, the performance of existing fMRI-based pain prediction models is far from satisfactory. The present study proposed a new approach which can design a prediction model specific to each individual or each experimental trial so that the specific model can achieve more accurate prediction of the intensity of nociceptive pain from single-trial fMRI responses. More precisely, the new approach uses a supervised k-means method on nociceptive-evoked fMRI responses to cluster individuals or trials into a set of subgroups, each of which has similar and consistent fMRI activation patterns. Then, for a new test individual/trial, the proposed approach chooses one subgroup of individuals/trials, which has the closest fMRI patterns to the test individual/trial, as training samples to train an individual-specific or a trial-specific pain prediction model. The new approach was tested on a nociceptive-evoked fMRI dataset and achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy than conventional non-specific models, which used all available training samples to train a model. The generalizability of the proposed approach is further validated by training specific models on one dataset and testing these models on an independent new dataset. This proposed individual-specific and trial-specific pain prediction approach has the potential to be used for the development of individualized and precise pain assessment tools in clinical practice.",

        "Abstract": "Pain is a subjective experience and clinicians need to treat patients with accurate pain levels. EEG has emerged as a useful tool for objective pain assessment, but due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of pain-related EEG signals, the prediction accuracy of EEG-based pain prediction models is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we proposed an autoencoder model based on convolutional neural networks for feature extraction of pain-related EEG signals. More precisely, we used EEGNet to build an autoencoder model to extract a small set of features from high-density pain-evoked EEG potentials and then establish a machine learning models to predict pain levels (high pain vs. low pain) from extracted features. Experimental results show that the new autoencoder-based approach can effectively identify pain-related features and can achieve better classification results than conventional methods.",

        "Abstract": "Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has became the most popular method to remove eye-blinking artifacts from electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. For long term EEG recording, ICA was commonly considered to costing a lot of computation time. Furthermore, with no ground truth, the discussion about the quality of ICA decomposition in a nonstationary environment was specious. In this study, we investigated the \"signal\" (P300 waveform) and the \"noise\" (averaged eye-blinking artifacts) on a cross-modal long-term EEG recording to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of different methods on ICA eye-blinking artifacts removal. As a result, it was found that, firstly, down sampling is an effective way to reduce the computation time in ICA. Appropriate down sampling ratio could speed up ICA computation 200 times and keep the decomposition performance stable, in which the computation time of ICA decomposition on a 2800 s EEG recording was less than 5 s. Secondly, dimension reduction by PCA was also a way to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ICA. Finally, the comparison by cropping the dataset indicated that performing ICA on each run of the experiment separately would achieve a better result for eye-blinking artifacts removal than using all the EEG data input for ICA.",

The combustion and soot formation were predicted by the finite-rate detailed chemistry model and modified Moss-Brookes model, respectively, while the turbulence was predicted by the detached eddy simulation (DES) with a low Reynolds number correction. Experimental results showed that the soot rate almost decreased linearly with the amplitude of acoustic oscillation, and the pinch-off of the flame occurred at a large acoustic oscillation.

        "Abstract": "This study investigated electroencephalogram (EEG) changes during movement preparation and execution in stroke patients. EEG-based event-related potential (ERP) technology was used to measure brain activity changes. Seventeen stroke patients participated in this study and completed ERP tests that were designed to measure EEG changes during unilateral upper limb movements in preparation and execution stages, with Instruction Response Movement (IRM) and Cued Instruction Response Movement (CIRM) paradigms. EEG data were analyzed using motor potential (MP) in the time domain and the mu-rhythm and beta frequency band response mean value (R-means) in the time-frequency domain. In IRM, the MP amplitude at Cz was higher during hemiplegic arm movement than during unaffected arm movement. MP latency was shorter at Cz and the contralesional motor cortex during hemiplegic arm movement in CIRM compared to IRM. No significant differences were found in R-means among locations, between movement sides in both ERP tests. This study presents the brain activity changes in the time and time-frequency domains in stroke patients during movement preparation and execution and supports the contralesional compensation and adjacent-region compensation mechanism of post-stroke brain reconstruction. These findings may contribute to future rehabilitation research about neuroplasticity and technology development such as the brain-computer interface.",

        "Title": "Sulforaphane prevents type 2 diabetes-induced nephropathy via AMPK-mediated activation of lipid metabolic pathways and Nrf2 antioxidative function.",
        "Abstract": "Sulforaphane (SFN) prevents diabetic nephropathy (DN) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) by up-regulating nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) can attenuate the pathogenesis of DN by improving renal lipotoxicity along with the activation of Nrf2-mediated antioxidative signaling. Therefore, we investigated whether AMPK\u03b12, the central subunit of AMPK in energy metabolism, is required for SFN protection against DN in T2D, and whether potential cross-talk occurs between AMPK\u03b12 and Nrf2. AMPK\u03b12 knockout (Ampk\u03b12-/-) mice and wildtype (WT) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a normal diet (ND) to induce insulin resistance, followed by streptozotocin (STZ) injection to induce hyperglycemia, as a T2D model. Both T2D and control mice were treated with SFN or vehicle for 3 months. At the end of the 3-month treatment, all mice were maintained only on HFD or ND for an additional 3 months without SFN treatment. Mice were killed at sixth month after T2D onset. Twenty-four-hour urine albumin at third and sixth months was significantly increased as renal dysfunction, along with significant renal pathological changes and biochemical changes including renal hypertrophy, oxidative damage, inflammation, and fibrosis in WT T2D mice, which were prevented by SFN in certain contexts, but not in Ampk\u03b12-/- T2D mice. SFN prevention of T2D-induced renal lipotoxicity was associated with AMPK-mediated activation of lipid metabolism and Nrf2-dependent antioxidative function in WT mice, but not in SFN-treated Ampk\u03b12-/- mice. Therefore, SFN prevention of DN is AMPK\u03b12-mediated activation of probably both lipid metabolism and Nrf2 via AMPK/AKT/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3\u03b2/Src family tyrosine kinase (Fyn) pathways.",

        "Abstract": "How parental histones, the carriers of epigenetic modifications, are deposited onto replicating DNA remains poorly understood. Here, we describe the eSPAN method (enrichment and sequencing of protein-associated nascent DNA) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and use it to detect histone deposition onto replicating DNA strands with a relatively small number of cells. We show that DNA polymerase \u03b1 (Pol \u03b1), which synthesizes short primers for DNA synthesis, binds histone H3-H4 preferentially. A Pol \u03b1 mutant defective in histone binding in vitro impairs the transfer of parental H3-H4 to lagging strands in both yeast and mouse ES cells. Last, dysregulation of both coding genes and noncoding endogenous retroviruses is detected in mutant ES cells defective in parental histone transfer. Together, we report an efficient eSPAN method for analysis of DNA replication-linked processes in mouse ES cells and reveal the mechanism of Pol \u03b1 in parental histone transfer.",
