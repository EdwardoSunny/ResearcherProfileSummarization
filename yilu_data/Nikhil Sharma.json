        "Abstract": "Accurate assessment of gestational age (GA) and identification of preterm birth (PTB) at delivery is essential to guide appropriate post-natal clinical care. Undoubtedly, dating ultrasound sonography (USG) is the gold standard to ascertain GA, but is not accessible to the majority of pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in rural areas and small secondary care hospitals. Conventional methods of post-natal GA assessment are not reliable at delivery and are further compounded by a lack of trained personnel to conduct them. We aimed to develop a population-specific GA model using integrated clinical and biochemical variables measured at delivery.",

        "Abstract": "The interferon (IFN) system protects mammals from diseases caused by virus infections. IFN synthesis is induced by pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways activated by virus infection. IFN is secreted from the infected cells and acts upon neighboring cells by binding cell surface receptors and triggering induction of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes and proteins, many of which block different steps of virus replication. The IFN-induced tetratricopeptide repeat proteins (IFIT) are a family of RNA-binding proteins. We and others have previously reported that IFIT2 protects mice from many neurotropic RNA viruses; indeed, Ifit2-/- mice are very susceptible to intranasal or subcutaneous infections with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Here, using a newly generated conditional knockout mouse, we report that ablation of Ifit2 expression only in neuronal cells was sufficient to render mice susceptible to neuropathogenesis caused by intranasal, but not subcutaneous, infection of VSV. Another genetically modified mouse line, expressing a mutant IFIT2 that cannot bind RNA, was as susceptible to VSV infection as ",

        "Abstract": "Demand for gender-affirming facial surgery is growing rapidly. Frontal sinus setback, one of the key procedures used in gender-affirming facial surgery, has a particularly high impact on gender perception. Mixed reality (MR) allows a user to view and virtually overlay three-dimensional imaging on the patient and interact with it in real time. We used the Medivis's SurgicalAR system in conjunction with the Microsoft HoloLens Lucille2 (Microsoft). Computed tomography imaging was uploaded to SurgicalAR, and a three-dimensional (3D) hologram was projected onto the display of the HoloLens. The hologram was registered and matched to the patient, allowing the surgeon to view bony anatomy and underlying structures in real time on the patient. The surgeon was able to outline the patient's frontal sinuses using the hologram as guidance. A 3D printed cutting guide was used for comparison. Negligible difference between the mixed reality-based outline and 3D-printed outline was seen. The process of loading the hologram and marking the frontal sinus outline lasted less than 10 minutes. The workflow and usage described here demonstrate significant promise for the use of mixed reality as imaging and surgical guidance technology in gender-affirming facial surgery.",

        "Abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) applications in neurosurgery have expanded over the past decade with the introduction of headset-based platforms. Many studies have focused on either preoperative planning to tailor the approach to the patient's anatomy and pathology or intraoperative surgical navigation, primarily realized as AR navigation through microscope oculars. Additional efforts have been made to validate AR in trainee and patient education and to investigate novel surgical approaches. Our objective was to provide a systematic overview of AR in neurosurgery, provide current limitations of this technology, as well as highlight several applications of AR in neurosurgery.",

        "Abstract": "Pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) including pediatric glioblastoma (pGBM) are highly aggressive pediatric central nervous system (CNS) malignancies. pGBM comprises approximately 3% of all pediatric CNS malignancies and has a 5-year survival rate of approximately 20%. Surgical resection and chemoradiation are often the standard of care for pGBM and pHGG, however, even with these interventions, survival for children diagnosed with pGBM and pHGG remains poor. Due to shortcomings associated with the standard of care, many efforts have been made to create novel immunotherapeutic approaches targeted to these malignancies. These efforts include the use of vaccines, cell-based therapies, and immune-checkpoint inhibitors. However, it is believed that in many pediatric glioma patients an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) possess barriers that limit the efficacy of immune-based therapies. One of these barriers includes the presence of immunosuppressive myeloid cells. In this review we will discuss the various types of myeloid cells present in the glioma TME, including macrophages and microglia, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and dendritic cells, as well as the specific mechanisms these cells can employ to enable immunosuppression. Finally, we will highlight therapeutic strategies targeted to these cells that are aimed at impeding myeloid-cell derived immunosuppression.",

        "Abstract": "Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) somatosensory neurons detect mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli acting on the body. Achieving a holistic view of how different DRG neuron subtypes relay neural signals from the periphery to the CNS has been challenging with existing tools. Here, we develop and curate a mouse genetic toolkit that allows for interrogating the properties and functions of distinct cutaneous targeting DRG neuron subtypes. These tools have enabled a broad morphological analysis, which revealed distinct cutaneous axon arborization areas and branching patterns of the transcriptionally distinct DRG neuron subtypes. Moreover, in\u00a0vivo physiological analysis revealed that each subtype has a distinct threshold and range of responses to mechanical and/or thermal stimuli. These findings support a model in which morphologically and physiologically distinct cutaneous DRG sensory neuron subtypes tile mechanical and thermal stimulus space to collectively encode a wide range of natural stimuli.",

Here, we report that inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, can induce IFN-\u03b2 through activation of the cytoplasmic RIG-I signaling pathway. However, RIG-I is activated not by RNA, but by PACT, the protein activator of PKR. In cell lines or primary cells expressing RIG-I and PACT, activation of the MAPK, p38, by cytokine signaling, leads to phosphorylation of PACT, which binds to primed RIG-I and activates its signaling pathway. Thus, a new mode of type I IFN induction by ubiquitous inflammatory cytokines has been revealed.",

        "Abstract": "To improve lithium-ion battery technology, it is essential to probe and comprehend the microscopic dynamic processes that occur in a real-world composite electrode under operating conditions. The primary and secondary particles are the structural building blocks of battery cathode electrodes. Their dynamic inconsistency has profound but not well-understood impacts. In this research, we combine operando coherent multi-crystal diffraction and optical microscopy to examine the chemical dynamics in local domains of layered oxide cathode. Our results not only pinpoint the asynchronicity of the lithium (de)intercalation at the sub-particle level, but also reveal sophisticated diffusion kinetics and reaction patterns, involving various localized processes, e.g., chemical onset, reaction front propagation, domains equilibration, particle\u00a0deformation\u00a0and motion. These observations shed new lights onto the activation and degradation mechanisms of state-of-the-art battery cathode materials.",

Our study highlights such cell-specific role of an ISG, Ddx3, which regulates the translation of mRNAs essential for interferon induction (PACT) and interferon signaling (STAT1) in a cell-specific manner. Our study also highlights the role of PACT in RNA virus-induced RLR signaling. Our study depicts how Ddx3 regulates innate immune signaling pathways in an indirect manner. Such cell-specific behavior of ISGs helps us to better understand viral pathogenesis and highlights the complexities of viral tropism and innate immune responses.",

        "Abstract": "To combat microbial infections, mammalian cells use a variety of innate immune response pathways to induce synthesis of anti-microbial proteins. The cGAS/STING pathway recognizes cytoplasmic viral or cellular DNA to elicit signals that lead to type I interferon and other cytokine synthesis. cGAMP, synthesized by DNA-activated cGAS, activates the ER-associated protein, STING, which oligomerizes and translocates to other intracellular membrane compartments to trigger different branches of signaling. We have reported that, in the ER, EGFR-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr245 of STING is required for its transit to the late endosomes, where it recruits and activates the transcription factor IRF3 required for IFN induction. In the current study, we inquired whether STING Tyr245 phosphorylation per se or STING's location in the late endosomes was critical for its ability to recruit IRF3 and induce IFN. Using pharmacological inhibitors or genetic ablation of proteins that are essential for specific steps of STING trafficking, we demonstrated that the presence of STING in the late endosomal membranes, even without Tyr245 phosphorylation, was sufficient for IRF3-mediated IFN induction.",

        "Abstract": "Evolutionary dynamics in spatially structured populations has been studied for a long time. More recently, the focus has been to construct structures that amplify selection by fixing beneficial mutations with higher probability than the well-mixed population and lower probability of fixation for deleterious mutations. It has been shown that for a structure to substantially amplify selection, self-loops are necessary when mutants appear predominately in nodes that change often. As a result, for low mutation rates, self-looped amplifiers attain higher steady-state average fitness in the mutation-selection balance than well-mixed populations. But what happens when the mutation rate increases such that fixation probabilities alone no longer describe the dynamics? We show that self-loops effects are detrimental outside the low mutation rate regime. In the intermediate and high mutation rate regime, amplifiers of selection attain lower steady-state average fitness than the complete graph and suppressors of selection. We also provide an estimate of the mutation rate beyond which the mutation-selection dynamics on a graph deviates from the weak mutation rate approximation. It involves computing average fixation time scaling with respect to the population sizes for several graphs.",

        "Abstract": "The development of bacterial resistance to chemical therapy poses a severe danger to efficacy of treating bacterial infections. One of the key factors for resistance to antimicrobial medications is growth of bacteria in biofilm. Quorum sensing (QS) inhibition was created as an alternative treatment by developing novel anti-biofilm medicines. Cell-cell communication is impeded by QS inhibition, which targets QS signaling pathway. The goal of this work is to develop newer drugs that are effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa by decreasing QS and acting as anti-biofilm agents. In this investigation, N-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)benzamide/N-(thiazol-2-yl)benzamide derivatives 3a-h were designed and synthesized in good yields. Further, molecular docking analyses revealed that binding affinity values were founded -11.2 to -7.6\u2005kcal/mol that were moderate to good. The physicochemical properties of these prepared compounds were investigated through in-silico method. Molecular dynamic simulation was also used to know better understanding of stability of the protein and ligand complex. Comparing N-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)benzamide 3a to salicylic acid (4.40\u00b10.10) that was utilised as standard for quorum sensing inhibitor, the anti-QS action was found greater for N-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)benzamide 3a (4.67\u00b10.45) than salicylic acid (4.40\u00b10.10). Overall, research results suggested that N-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)benzamide/N-(thiazol-2-yl)benzamide derivatives 3a-h may hold to develop new quorum sensing inhibitors.",

        "Abstract": "The properties of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons that innervate the distal colon are poorly defined, hindering our understanding of their roles in normal physiology and gastrointestinal (GI) disease. Here, we report genetically defined subsets of colon-innervating DRG neurons with diverse morphologic and physiologic properties. Four colon-innervating DRG neuron populations are mechanosensitive and exhibit distinct force thresholds to colon distension. The highest threshold population, selectively labeled using Bmpr1b genetic tools, is necessary and sufficient for behavioral responses to high colon distension, which is partly mediated by the mechanosensory ion channel Piezo2. This A\u03b4-HTMR population mediates behavioral over-reactivity to colon distension caused by inflammation in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, like cutaneous DRG mechanoreceptor populations, colon-innervating mechanoreceptors exhibit distinct anatomical and physiological properties and tile force threshold space, and genetically defined colon-innervating HTMRs mediate pathophysiological responses to colon distension, revealing a target population for therapeutic intervention.",

        "Abstract": "High quality surgical lighting is central to successful performance in the operating room and therefore to both patient care and treatment. This article discusses the origins of surgical lighting from the 1800s to today, with a focus on the four main forms. Their uses, advantages, and disadvantages are evaluated in an effort to identify the improvements required to improve today's current state of surgical lighting. Whilst these four mainstream types have served well for the past thirty years, the literature exposes opportunities for improvement and can be used to guide the pathway to transition from manual conventional methods to a more automated lighting (AL) approach. The concept of AL has been proposed using established and known technical approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI), 3D sensor tracking algorithms and thermal imaging. Whilst AL seems incredibly promising, further focused research must be undertaken to maximise its' effectiveness and allow for successful integration of this new technology into operating rooms today.",

        "Abstract": "Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a key enzyme in normal metabolism and homeostasis. However, mutant forms of IDH are also defining features of a subset of diffuse gliomas. In this review, we highlight current techniques targeting IDH-mutated gliomas and summarize current and completed clinical trials exploring these strategies. We discuss clinical data from peptide vaccines, mutant IDH (mIDH) inhibitors, and PARP inhibitors. Peptide vaccines have the unique advantage of targeting the specific epitope of a patient's tumor, inducing a highly tumor-specific CD4+ T-cell response. mIDH-inhibitors, on the other hand, specifically target mutant IDH proteins in cancer cell metabolism and thus help halt gliomagenesis. We also explore PARP inhibitors and their role in treating diffuse gliomas, which exploit IDH-mutant diffuse gliomas by allowing the persistence of unrepaired DNA complexes. We summarize various completed and current trials targeting IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in diffuse gliomas. Therapies targeting mutant IDH have significant promise in treating progressive or recurrent IDH-mutant gliomas and may significantly change treatment paradigms in the next decade.",

        "Title": "Optimizing crop rotations via Parrondo's paradox for sustainable agriculture.",
        "Abstract": "Crop rotation, a sustainable agricultural technique, has been at humanity's disposal since time immemorial and is practised globally. Switching between cover crops and cash crops helps avoid the adverse effects of intensive farming. Determining the optimum cash-cover rotation schedule for maximizing yield has been tackled on multiple fronts by agricultural scientists, economists, biologists and computer scientists, to name a few. However, considering the uncertainty due to diseases, pests, droughts, floods and impending effects of climate change is essential when designing rotation strategies. Analysing this time-tested technique of crop rotations with a new lens of Parrondo's paradox allows us to optimally use the rotation technique in synchrony with uncertainty. While previous approaches are reactive to the diversity of crop types and environmental uncertainties, we make use of the said uncertainties to enhance crop rotation schedules. We calculate optimum switching probabilities in a randomized cropping sequence and suggest optimum deterministic sequences and judicious use of fertilizers. Our methods demonstrate strategies to enhance crop yield and the eventual profit margins for farmers. Conforming to translational biology, we extend Parrondo's paradox, where two losing situations can be combined eventually into a winning scenario, to agriculture.",

        "Abstract": "Mechanical and thermal stimuli acting on the skin are detected by morphologically and physiologically distinct sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Achieving a holistic view of how this diverse neuronal population relays sensory information from the skin to the central nervous system (CNS) has been challenging with existing tools. Here, we used transcriptomic datasets of the mouse DRG to guide development and curation of a genetic toolkit to interrogate transcriptionally defined DRG neuron subtypes. Morphological analysis revealed unique cutaneous axon arborization areas and branching patterns of each subtype. Physiological analysis showed that subtypes exhibit distinct thresholds and ranges of responses to mechanical and/or thermal stimuli. The somatosensory neuron toolbox thus enables comprehensive phenotyping of most principal sensory neuron subtypes. Moreover, our findings support a population coding scheme in which the activation thresholds of morphologically and physiologically distinct cutaneous DRG neuron subtypes tile multiple dimensions of stimulus space.",

        "Abstract": "Learning in the operating theatre forms a critical part of postgraduate medical education. Postgraduate doctors present a diverse cohort of learners with a wide range of learning needs that will vary by their level of experience and curriculum requirements. With evidence of both trainee dissatisfaction with the theatre learning experience and reduced time spent in the operating theatre, which has been exacerbated by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is vital that every visit to the operating theatre is used as a learning opportunity. We have devised 12 tips aimed at both learners and surgeons to optimise learning in the operating theatre, set out into four domains: educational context, preparation, learning in theatre, feedback and reflection. These tips have been created by a process of literature review and acknowledgment of established learning theory, with further discussion amongst surgical trainees, senior surgical faculty, surgical educators and medical education faculty.",

        "Title": "Water discharge variations control fluvial stratigraphic architecture in the Middle Eocene Escanilla formation, Spain.",
        "Abstract": "Ancient fluvial deposits typically display repetitive changes in their depositional architecture such as alternating intervals of coarse-grained highly amalgamated (HA), laterally-stacked, channel bodies, and finer-grained less amalgamated (LA), vertically-stacked, channels encased in floodplain deposits. Such patterns are usually ascribed to slower, respectively higher, rates of base level rise (accommodation). However, \"upstream\" factors such as water discharge and sediment flux also play a potential role in determining stratigraphic architecture, yet this possibility has never been tested despite the recent advances in the field of palaeohydraulic reconstructions from fluvial accumulations. Here, we chronicle riverbed gradient evolution within three Middle Eocene (~\u200940\u00a0Ma) fluvial HA-LA sequences in the Escanilla Formation in the south-Pyrenean foreland basin. This work documents, for the first time in a fossil fluvial system, how the ancient riverbed systematically evolved from lower slopes in coarser-grained HA intervals, and higher slopes in finer-grained LA intervals, suggesting that bed slope changes were determined primarily by climate-controlled water discharge variations rather than base level changes as often hypothesized. This highlights the important connection between climate and landscape evolution and has fundamental implications for our ability to reconstruct ancient hydroclimates from the interpretation of fluvial sedimentary sequences.",

        "Title": "Quorum sensing inhibitors as Therapeutics: Bacterial biofilm inhibition.",
        "Abstract": "The overuse and inappropriate use of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections has led to the development of multiple drug resistant strains. Biofilm is a complex microorganism aggregation defined by the presence of a dynamic, sticky, and protective extracellular matrix made of polysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids. The infectious diseases are caused by bacteria that flourish within quorum sensing (QS) mediated biofilms. Efforts to disrupt biofilms have enabled the identification of bioactive molecules produced by prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The QS system is quenched predominantly by these molecules. The phenomenon is also termed as quorum sensing (QS). Both synthetic and natural substances have been discovered to be useful in QS. This review describes natural and synthetic quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) with the potential to treat bacterial infections. It includes the discussion on quorum sensing, mechanism of quorum sensing, effect of substituents on the activity. These discoveries could result in effective therapies using far lower dosages of medications, particularly antibiotics, are currently needed.",

        "Abstract": "The structure of a population strongly influences its evolutionary dynamics. In various settings ranging from biology to social systems, individuals tend to interact more often with those present in their proximity and rarely with those far away. A common approach to model the structure of a population is evolutionary graph theory. In this framework, each graph node is occupied by a reproducing individual. The links connect these individuals to their neighbours. The offspring can be placed on neighbouring nodes, replacing the neighbours-or the progeny of its neighbours can replace a node during the course of ongoing evolutionary dynamics. Extending this theory by replacing single individuals with subpopulations at nodes yields a graph-structured metapopulation. The dynamics between the different local subpopulations is set by an update mechanism. There are many such update mechanisms. Here, we classify update mechanisms for structured metapopulations, which allows to find commonalities between past work and illustrate directions for further research and current gaps of investigation.",

        "Abstract": "A majority of people living with motor neuron disease (MND) experience weakness of the neck and as a result, experience head drop. This exacerbates problems with everyday activities (eating, talking, breathing, etc). Neck collars are often used to support head drop; however, these are typically designed for prehospitalization settings to manage and brace the cervical region of the spine. As a result, it has been recorded that people living with MND often reject these collars for a variety of reasons but most notably because they are too restricting. The current standardized outcome measures (most notably restricting cervical range of motion) used for neck collars are summarized herein along with whether they are suitable for a bespoke neck collar specifically designed for people living with MND.",

        "Abstract": "Dentistry is undergoing a gentle revolution that will consign drill and fill to history. In order to increase the acceptance of dental treatment, efforts are directed toward changing traditional painful dentistry into a new concept of painless dentistry. It is common practice to utilize burs for caries removal and cavity preparation. Chemomechanical caries removal is a painless procedure that uses a chemical substance to eradicate diseased dentine. With the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Erbium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er: YAG) laser systems for caries removal and cavity preparation, the discipline of laser operational dentistry was born out of a desire to find a way to remove the decay without causing any pain or stress to the surrounding healthy tissue.",

        "Abstract": "The effectiveness of treating bacterial infections is seriously threatened by the emergence of bacterial resistance to chemical treatment. Growth of microbes in biofilm is one of the main causes of resistance to antimicrobial drugs. Quorum sensing (QS) inhibition, which targets the QS signalling system by obstructing cell-cell communication, was developed as an alternative treatment by creating innovative anti-biofilm drugs. Therefore, the goal of this study is to develop novel antimicrobial drugs that are effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa by inhibiting QS and acting as anti-biofilm agents. In this study, N-(2- and 3-pyridinyl)benzamide derivatives were selected to design and syntheses. Antibiofilm activity was revealed by all the synthesized compounds and the biofilm was visibly impaired, and the OD",

SEEG has several advantages such as the ability to record deep cortical structures, mapping the epileptogenic zone in a three-dimensional manner, and analyze bihemispheric regions without the need for bilateral craniotomies. In patients with bilateral hemispheric hypotheses, especially the mesial surface of frontal lobes, bilateral lead placement is compulsory to further define and localize the epileptogenic zone. In this particular cohort of patients, bilateral monitoring may be accomplished from a single entry point using trans-interhemispheric placement of the electrodes. The use of trans-interhemispheric monitoring offers several advantages including sparing the need for additional leads.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant delays in NHS pathways; the majority of GP appointments now occur online with subsequent delays in secondary care assessment. Given the rapid progression of MND, patients may be disproportionately affected resulting in late stage new presentations. We used Monte Carlo simulation to model the pre-COVID-19 diagnostic pathway and then introduced plausible COVID-19 delays.",

        "Abstract": "The air quality index (AQI) forecasts are one of the most important aspects of improving urban public health and enabling society to remain sustainable despite the effects of air pollution. Pollution control organizations deploy ground stations to collect information about air pollutants. Establishing a ground station all-around is not feasible due to the cost involved. As an alternative, satellite-captured data can be utilized for AQI assessment. This study explores the changes in AQI during various COVID-19 lockdowns in India utilizing satellite data. Furthermore, it addresses the effectiveness of state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical approaches for forecasting short-term AQI.",

In this protocol, we first describe the procedure for targeted intracranial delivery of LNAs to silence microRNAs specifically in the mouse brain. We then detail the steps to isolate RNA and protein from mouse brain, followed by using RT-PCR and Western blotting to confirm microRNA silencing. This noninvasive approach can only be applied to mouse brain to specifically target silencing of microRNAs. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Sharma et\u00a0al. (2021).",

        "Title": "Bioinformatics pipeline unveils genetic variability to synthetic vaccine design for Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes.",
        "Abstract": "In the worrisome scenarios of various waves of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline is essential to analyse the virus genomes in order to understand its evolution, thereby identifying mutations as signature SNPs, conserved regions and subsequently to design epitope based synthetic vaccine. We have thus performed multiple sequence alignment of 4996 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes as a case study using MAFFT followed by phylogenetic analysis using Nextstrain to identify virus clades. Furthermore, based on the entropy of each genomic coordinate of the aligned sequences, conserved regions are identified. After refinement of the conserved regions, based on its length, one conserved region is identified for which the primers and probes are reported for virus detection. The refined conserved regions are also used to identify T-cell and B-cell epitopes along with their immunogenic and antigenic scores. Such scores are used for selecting the most immunogenic and antigenic epitopes. By executing this pipeline, 40 unique signature SNPs are identified resulting in 23 non-synonymous signature SNPs which provide 28 amino acid changes in protein. On the other hand, 12 conserved regions are selected based on refinement criteria out of which one is selected as the potential target for virus detection. Additionally, 22 MHC-I and 21 MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes with 10 unique HLA alleles each and 17 B-cell epitopes are obtained for 12 conserved regions. All the results are validated both quantitatively and qualitatively which show that from genetic variability to synthetic vaccine design, the proposed pipeline can be used effectively to combat SARS-CoV-2.",

        "Abstract": "The human gut microbiome interacts with many diseases, with recent small studies suggesting a link with COVID-19 severity. Exploring this association at the population-level may provide novel insights and help to explain differences in COVID-19 severity between countries. We explore whether there is an association between the gut microbiome of people within different countries and the severity of COVID-19, measured as hospitalisation rate. We use data from the large (n = 3,055) open-access gut microbiome repository curatedMetagenomicData, as well as demographic and country-level metadata. Twelve countries were placed\u00a0into two groups (high/low) according to COVID-19 hospitalisation rate before December 2020 (ourworldindata.com). We use an unsupervised machine learning method, Topological Data Analysis (TDA). This method analyses both the local geometry and global topology of a high-dimensional dataset, making it particularly suitable for population-level microbiome data. We report an association of distinct baseline population-level gut microbiome signatures with COVID-19 severity. This was found both with a PERMANOVA, as well as with TDA. Specifically, it suggests an association of anti-inflammatory bacteria, including ",

        "Abstract": "Bundle branch re-entrant ventricular tachycardia (VT) (BBR-VT) is a unique type of ventricular tachycardia often seen in patients with advanced heart diseases. Rarely, it is found in patients with a structurally normal heart. We describe a case of BBR-VT in a patient with normal ventricular function, a year after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for aortic stenosis. A 73-year-old man with a past medical history of non-obstructive coronary artery disease and severe aortic stenosis status post-TAVR with a 23-mm Sapien valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) about 1 year prior presented with palpitations and syncope. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a wide complex tachycardia with a left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern and atrioventricular dissociation. The tachycardia was incessant and paroxysmal during 24-h telemetry monitoring. An electrophysiology study showed a normal A-H interval of 90 ms and a prolonged H-V interval of 84 ms with evidence of a split His. A hemodynamically stable VT was induced with a cycle length of 453 ms, which was identical to the clinical VT. This was diagnosed to be BBR-VT given the typical ECG pattern of LBBB, the presence of His inscription before each ventricular signal, and the H-H interval variation-predicted V-V variation when there was a wobble in tachycardia cycle length. Injury of the His-Purkinje system post-TAVR can provide the substrate for the development of BBR-VT. Current published literature shows early occurrence post-TAVR, but our case suggests that the timing between the index procedure and arrhythmia occurrence can be variable.",

        "Abstract": "Evolutionary dynamics on graphs has remarkable features: For example, it has been shown that amplifiers of selection exist that-compared to an unstructured population-increase the fixation probability of advantageous mutations, while they decrease the fixation probability of disadvantageous mutations. So far, the theoretical literature has focused on the case of a single mutant entering a graph-structured population, asking how the graph affects the probability that a mutant takes over a population and the time until this typically happens. For continuously evolving systems, the more relevant case is that mutants constantly arise in an evolving population. Typically, such mutations occur with a small probability during reproduction events. We thus focus on the low mutation rate limit. The probability distribution for the fitness in this process converges to a steady state at long times. Intuitively, amplifiers of selection are expected to increase the population's mean fitness in the steady state. Similarly, suppressors of selection are expected to decrease the population's mean fitness in the steady state. However, we show that another set of graphs, called suppressors of fixation, can attain the highest population mean fitness. The key reason behind this is their ability to efficiently reject deleterious mutants. This illustrates the importance of the deleterious mutant regime for the long-term evolutionary dynamics, something that seems to have been overlooked in the literature so far.",

        "Abstract": "Chemomechanics is an old subject, yet its importance has been revived in rechargeable batteries where the mechanical energy and damage associated with redox reactions can significantly affect both the thermodynamics and rates of key electrochemical processes. Thanks to the push for clean energy and advances in characterization capabilities, significant research efforts in the last two decades have brought about a leap forward in understanding the intricate chemomechanical interactions regulating battery performance. Going forward, it is necessary to consolidate scattered ideas in the literature into a structured framework for future efforts across multidisciplinary fields. This review sets out to distill and structure what the authors consider to be significant recent developments on the study of chemomechanics of rechargeable batteries in a concise and accessible format to the audiences of different backgrounds in electrochemistry, materials, and mechanics. Importantly, we review the significance of chemomechanics in the context of battery performance, as well as its mechanistic understanding by combining electrochemical, materials, and mechanical perspectives. We discuss the coupling between the elements of electrochemistry and mechanics, key experimental and modeling tools from the small to large scales, and design considerations. Lastly, we provide our perspective on ongoing challenges and opportunities ranging from quantifying mechanical degradation in batteries to manufacturing battery materials and developing cyclic protocols to improve the mechanical resilience.",

        "Title": "Human miRNAs to Identify Potential Regions of SARS-CoV-2.",
        "Abstract": "It is two years now but the world is still struggling against COVID-19 due to the havoc created by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its multiple variants. Considering this perspective, in this work, we have hypothesized a new approach in order to identify potential regions in SARS-CoV-2 similar to the human miRNAs. Thus, they may have similar consequences as caused by the human miRNAs in human body. Therefore, the same way by which human miRNAs are inhibited can be applied for such potential regions of virus as well by administering drugs to the interacting human proteins. In this regard, the multiple sequence alignment technique Clustal Omega is used to align 2656 human miRNAs with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome to identify the potential regions within the virus reference genome which have high similarities with the human miRNAs. The potential regions in virus genome are identified based on the highest number of nucleotide match, greater than or equal to 5 at a genomic position, for the aligned miRNAs. As a result, 38 potential SARS-CoV-2 regions are identified consisting of 249 human miRNAs. Among these 38 potential regions, some top regions belong to nucleocapsid, RdRp, helicase, and ORF8. To understand the biological significance of these potential regions, the targets of the human miRNAs are considered for KEGG pathways and protein-protein and drug-protein interaction analysis as the human miRNAs are similar to the potential regions of SARS-CoV-2. Significant pathways are found which lead to comorbidities. Subsequently, drugs like emodin, bicalutamide, vorinostat, etc. are identified that may be used for clinical trials.",

        "Abstract": "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) associated Cas protein (CRISPR-Cas) has turned out to be a very important tool for the rapid detection of viruses. This can be used for the identification of the target site in a virus by identifying a 3-6 nt length Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) adjacent to the potential target site, thus motivating us to adopt CRISPR-Cas technique to identify SARS-CoV-2 as well as other members of Coronaviridae family. In this regard, we have developed a fast and effective method using k-mer technique in order to identify the PAM by scanning the whole genome of the respective virus. Subsequently, palindromic sequences adjacent to the PAM locations are identified as the potential target sites. Palindromes are considered in this work as they are known to identify viruses. Once all the palindrome-PAM combinations are identified, PAMs specific for the RNA-guided DNA Cas9/Cas12 endonuclease are identified to bind and cut the target sites. In this regard, PAMs such as 5'-TGG-3' and 5'-TTTA-3' in NSP3 and Exon for SARS-CoV-2, 5'-GGG-3' and 5'-TGG-3' in Exon and NSP2 for MERS-CoV and 5'-AGG-3' and 5'-TTTG-3' in Helicase and NSP3 respectively for SARS-CoV-1 are identified corresponding to SpCas9 and FnCas12a endonucleases. Finally, to recognise the target sites of Coronaviridae family as cleaved by SpCas9 and FnCas12a, complements of the palindromic target regions are designed as primers or guide RNA (gRNA). Therefore, such complementary gRNAs along with respective Cas proteins can be considered in assays for the identification of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1.",

        "Abstract": "The nature and the intensity of innate immune response to virus infection determine the course of pathogenesis in the host. Among the many pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition receptors, STING, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein, plays a pivotal role in triggering responses to microbial or cellular cytoplasmic DNA. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), a common human pathogen, activates STING signaling, and the resultant induction of type I interferon causes inhibition of virus replication. In this context, we have observed that phosphorylation of Tyr245 of STING by epidermal growth factor receptor kinase is necessary for interferon induction. Here, we report that phosphorylation of Tyr240 by the tyrosine kinase Syk is essential for all signaling activities of STING. Our analysis showed that upon ligand-binding, STING dimerizes and interacts with membrane-bound EGFR, which autophosphorylates and provides the platform for the recruitment of cytoplasmic Syk to the signaling complex and its activation. Activated Syk phosphorylates Tyr240 of STING, followed by phosphorylation of Tyr245 by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Pharmacological or genetic ablation of Syk activity resulted in an arrest of STING in the ER compartment and a complete block of gene induction. Consequently, in the absence of Syk, HSV-1 could not induce interferon, and it replicated more robustly. ",

        "Abstract": "Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread very rapidly around the world, resulting in a global pandemic. Though the vaccination process has started, the number of COVID-affected patients is still quite large. Hence, an analysis of hotspot mutations of the different evolving virus strains needs to be carried out. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment of 71,038 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 98 countries over the period from January 2020 to June 2021 is performed using MAFFT followed by phylogenetic analysis in order to visualize the virus evolution. These steps resulted in the identification of hotspot mutations as deletions and substitutions in the coding regions based on entropy greater than or equal to 0.3, leading to a total of 45 unique hotspot mutations. Moreover, 10,286 Indian sequences are considered from 71,038 global SARS-CoV-2 sequences as a demonstrative example that gives 52 unique hotspot mutations. Furthermore, the evolution of the hotspot mutations along with the mutations in variants of concern is visualized, and their characteristics are discussed as well. Also, for all the non-synonymous substitutions (missense mutations), the functional consequences of amino acid changes in the respective protein structures are calculated using PolyPhen-2 and I-Mutant 2.0. In addition to this, SSIPe is used to report the binding affinity between the receptor-binding domain of Spike protein and human ACE2 protein by considering L452R, T478K, E484Q, and N501Y hotspot mutations in that region.",

        "Abstract": "Healthcare costs have been dramatically rising in developed economies worldwide. A key driver of cost increases has been high-cost drugs. The current model of reimbursement is not configured for drugs with uncertain outcomes. Future reimbursement will require better allocation of available healthcare system funds. Technological advancements have opened the door to a new type of outcomes-based reimbursement, enabling value exchange between payers and pharmaceutical companies, which we term precision reimbursement. Precision reimbursement extends beyond value-based contracts, with decisions at individual rather than aggregate level. For precision reimbursement to be adopted, there are data, computation and infrastructure requirements. All stakeholders benefit in moving to precision reimbursement for optimal resource allocation, risk sharing and, ultimately, improved outcomes. There are implementation challenges including cost, change management, information governance and development of surrogate markers. The overarching trend in medicine is toward personalised interventions, with precision reimbursement as the logical consequence.",

        "Abstract": "Introduction Vancomycin may be used as an alternative perioperative antibiotic for penicillin-allergic patients but follows a different infusion timing. At the institution presented herein, noncompliance with recommended vancomycin infusion timing has been hypothesized to contribute toward increased risk of surgical site infections and avoidable expenditures. The objective of this project was to utilize the Performance Improvement In Action methodology to identify, address, and solve the problem of vancomycin administration timing. Methodology This study took place at a multi-hospital, urban academic medical center. The protocol was developed by neurosurgery and anesthesia faculty, advanced practice providers, nursing, and pharmacy. Timing of the following points was recorded: initial order, order release, pharmacy verification, vancomycin infusion, and surgical incision. Fifty consecutive penicillin-allergic patients undergoing neurosurgical intervention were prospectively enrolled. Data comparison was made between the pilot and retrospective review cohorts. Results The pilot cohort achieved correct administration of vancomycin in 100% of cases. Average infusion start time prior to incision increased by 257% (p<0.0001). Conclusions This study demonstrates a departmental capacity for optimized timing of vancomycin infusions, in a budget- and workflow-neutral process, while reducing inappropriate administration. In the future, this protocol may be scaled to additional\u00a0departments and institutions to appropriately and efficiently administer perioperative vancomycin and mitigate the risk for surgical site infections.",

        "Title": "Interactome of human and SARS-CoV-2 proteins to identify human hub proteins associated with comorbidities.",
        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has a higher chance of progression in adults of any age with certain underlying health conditions or comorbidities like cancer, neurological diseases and in certain cases may even lead to death. Like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 also interacts with host proteins to pave its entry into host cells. Therefore, to understand the behaviour of SARS-CoV-2 and design of effective antiviral drugs, host-virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs) can be very useful. In this regard, we have initially created a human-SARS-CoV-2 PPI database from existing works in the literature which has resulted in 7085 unique PPIs. Subsequently, we have identified at most 10 proteins with highest degrees viz. hub proteins from interacting human proteins for individual virus protein. The identification of these hub proteins is important as they are connected to most of the other human proteins. Consequently, when they get affected, the potential diseases are triggered in the corresponding pathways, thereby leading to comorbidities. Furthermore, the biological significance of the identified hub proteins is shown using KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analysis. KEGG pathway analysis is also essential for identifying the pathways leading to comorbidities. Among others, SARS-CoV-2 proteins viz. NSP2, NSP5, Envelope and ORF10 interacting with human hub proteins like COX4I1, COX5A, COX5B, NDUFS1, CANX, HSP90AA1 and TP53 lead to comorbidities. Such comorbidities are Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, HTLV-1 infection, prostate cancer and viral carcinogenesis. Subsequently, using Enrichr tool possible repurposable drugs which target the human hub proteins are reported in this paper as well. Therefore, this work provides a consolidated study for human-SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions to understand the relationship between comorbidity and hub proteins so that it may pave the way for the development of anti-viral drugs.",

Pseudo-unipolar in shape, and among the largest (longest) cells of most mammals, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) somatosensory neurons have peripheral axons that extend into skin, muscle, viscera, or bone and central axons that innervate the spinal cord and brainstem, where they synaptically engage the central somatosensory circuitry. Here, we review the diversity of mammalian DRG neuron subtypes and the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that control their development. We describe classical and contemporary advances that frame our understanding of DRG neurogenesis, transcriptional specification of DRG neurons, and the establishment of morphological, physiological, and synaptic diversification across somatosensory neuron subtypes.",

        "Abstract": "STING is a nodal point for cellular innate immune response to microbial infections, autoimmunity and cancer; it triggers the synthesis of the antiviral proteins, type I interferons. Many DNA viruses, including Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV1), trigger STING signaling causing inhibition of virus replication. Here, we report that HSV1 evades this antiviral immune response by inducing a cellular microRNA, miR-24, which binds to the 3' untranslated region of STING mRNA and inhibits its translation. Expression of the gene encoding miR-24 is induced by the transcription factor AP1 and activated by MAP kinases in HSV1-infected cells. Introduction of exogenous miR-24 or prior activation of MAPKs, causes further enhancement of HSV1 replication in STING-expressing cells. Conversely, transfection of antimiR-24 inhibits virus replication in those cells. HSV1 infection of mice causes neuropathy and death; using two routes of infection, we demonstrated that intracranial injection of antimiR-24 alleviates both morbidity and mortality of the infected mice. Our studies reveal a new immune evasion strategy adopted by HSV1 through the regulation of STING and demonstrates that it can be exploited to enhance STING's antiviral action.",

        "Title": "Characterisation of SARS-CoV-2 clades based on signature SNPs unveils continuous evolution.",
        "Abstract": "Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China more than a year ago, it has spread across the world in a very short span of time. Although, different forms of vaccines are being rolled out for vaccination programs around the globe, the mutation of the virus is still a cause of concern among the research communities. Hence, it is important to study the constantly evolving virus and its strains in order to provide a much more stable form of cure. This fact motivated us to conduct this research where we have initially carried out multiple sequence alignment of 15359 and 3033 global dataset without Indian and the dataset of exclusive Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes respectively, using MAFFT. Subsequently, phylogenetic analyses are performed using Nextstrain to identify virus clades. Consequently, the virus strains are found to be distributed among 5 major clades or clusters viz. 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B and 20C. Thereafter, mutation points as SNPs are identified in each clade. Henceforth, from each clade top 10 signature SNPs are identified based on their frequency i.e. number of occurrences in the virus genome. As a result, 50 such signature SNPs are individually identified for global dataset without Indian and dataset of exclusive Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes respectively. Out of each 50 signature SNPs, 39 and 41 unique SNPs are identified among which 25 non-synonymous signature SNPs (out of 39) resulted in 30 amino acid changes in protein while 27 changes in amino acid are identified from 22 non-synonymous signature SNPs (out of 41). These 30 and 27 amino acid changes for the non-synonymous signature SNPs are visualised in their respective protein structure as well. Finally, in order to judge the characteristics of the identified clades, the non-synonymous signature SNPs are considered to evaluate the changes in proteins as biological functions with the sequences using PROVEAN and PolyPhen-2 while I-Mutant 2.0 is used to evaluate their structural stability. As a consequence, for global dataset without Indian sequences, G251V in ORF3a in clade 19A, F308Y and G196V in NSP4 and ORF3a in 19B are the unique amino acid changes which are responsible for defining each clade as they are all deleterious and unstable. Such changes which are common for both global dataset without Indian and dataset of exclusive Indian sequences are R203M in Nucleocapsid for 20B, T85I and Q57H in NSP2 and ORF3a respectively for 20C while for exclusive Indian sequences such unique changes are A97V in RdRp, G339S and G339C in NSP2 in 19A and Q57H in ORF3a in 20A.",

        "Abstract": "Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that is mainly initiated by plaque biofilm which may require treatment using periodontal flap surgery. Recently, diode lasers have become popular in the field of periodontology owing to advantages such as antibacterial effect, promoting angiogenesis, and providing hemostasis. However, scientific data on application of diode laser in periodontal flap surgery and its benefits are limited. Hence, the aim of the study was to investigate the adjunctive effect of removal of remnant pocket epithelium by 980 nm diode laser and biostimulation in modified Widman flap (MWF) surgery for the treatment of chronic periodontitis.",

        "Abstract": "The surge of SARS-CoV-2 has created a wave of pandemic around the globe due to its high transmission rate. To contain this virus, researchers are working around the clock for a solution in the form of vaccine. Due to the impact of this pandemic, the economy and healthcare have immensely suffered around the globe. Thus, an efficient vaccine design is the need of the hour. Moreover, to have a generalised vaccine for heterogeneous human population, the virus genomes from different countries should be considered. Thus, in this work, we have performed genome-wide analysis of 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries around the globe in order to identify the potential conserved regions for the development of peptide based synthetic vaccine viz. epitopes with high immunogenic and antigenic scores. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment technique viz. Clustal Omega is used to align the 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes. Thereafter, entropy is computed for each genomic coordinate of the aligned genomes. The entropy values are then used to find the conserved regions. These conserved regions are refined based on the criteria that their lengths should be greater than or equal to 60\u00a0nt and their corresponding protein sequences are without any stop codons. Furthermore, Nucleotide BLAST is used to verify the specificity of the conserved regions. As a result, we have obtained 17 conserved regions that belong to NSP3, NSP4, NSP6, NSP8, RdRp, Helicase, endoRNAse, 2'-O-RMT, Spike glycoprotein, ORF3a protein, Membrane glycoprotein and Nucleocapsid protein. Finally, these conserved regions are used to identify the T-cell and B-cell epitopes with their corresponding immunogenic and antigenic scores. Based on these scores, the most immunogenic and antigenic epitopes are then selected for each of these 17 conserved regions. Hence, we have obtained 30 MHC-I and 24 MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes with 14 and 13 unique HLA alleles and 21 B-cell epitopes for the 17 conserved regions. Moreover, for validating the relevance of these epitopes, the binding conformation of the MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes are shown with respect to HLA alleles. Also, the physico-chemical properties of the epitopes are reported along with Ramchandran plots and Z-Scores and the population coverage is shown as well. Overall, the analysis shows that the identified epitopes can be considered as potential candidates for vaccine design.",

        "Abstract": "Motor cortex (M1) paired-pulse TMS (ppTMS) probes excitatory and inhibitory intracortical dynamics by measurement of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). However, MEPs reflect cortical and spinal excitabilities and therefore cannot isolate cortical function. Concurrent TMS-EEG has the ability to measure cortical function, while limiting peripheral confounds; TMS stimulates M1, whilst EEG acts as the readout: the TMS-evoked potential (TEP). Whilst varying preconditioning stimulus intensity influences intracortical inhibition measured by MEPs, the effects on TEPs is undefined. TMS was delivered to the left M1 using single-pulse and three, ppTMS paradigms, each using a different preconditioning stimulus: 70%, 80% or 90% of resting motor threshold. Corticospinal inhibition was present in all three ppTMS conditions. ppTMS TEP peaks were reduced predominantly under the ppTMS 70 protocol but less so for ppTMS 80 and not at all for ppTMS 90. There was a significant negative correlation between MEPs and N45 TEP peak for ppTMS 70 reaching statistical trends for ppTMS 80 and 90. Whilst ppTMS MEPs show inhibition across a range of preconditioning stimulus intensities, ppTMS TEPs do not. TEPs after M1 ppTMS vary as a function of preconditioning stimulus intensity: smaller preconditioning stimulus intensities result in better discriminability between conditioned and unconditioned TEPs. We recommend that preconditioning stimulus intensity should be minimized when using ppTMS to probe intracortical inhibition.",

In this mini-review, we explore the direct and indirect influences of the pandemic on the gut microbiome and how these can affect research and clinical trials. We explore the direct bidirectional relationships between the COVID-19 virus and the gut and lung microbiomes. We then consider the significant indirect effects of the pandemic, such as repeated lockdowns, increased hand hygiene, and changes to mood and diet, that could all lead to longstanding changes to the gut microbiome at an individual and a population level. Together, these changes may affect long term microbiome research, both in observational as well as in population studies, requiring urgent attention. Finally, we explore the unique implications for clinical trials using faecal microbiota transplants (FMT), which are increasingly investigated as potential treatments for a range of diseases. The pandemic introduces new barriers to participation in trials, while the direct and indirect effects laid out above can present a confounding factor. This affects recruitment and sample size, as well as study design and statistical analyses. Therefore, the potential impact of the pandemic on gut microbiome research is significant and needs to be specifically addressed by the research community and funders.",

        "Abstract": "Since the onslaught of SARS-CoV-2, the research community has been searching for a vaccine to fight against this virus. However, during this period, the virus has mutated to adapt to the different environmental conditions in the world and made the task of vaccine design more challenging. In this situation, the identification of virus strains is very much timely and important task. We have performed genome-wide analysis of 10664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries to identify and prepare a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) dataset of SARS-CoV-2. Thereafter, with the use of this SNP data, the advantage of hierarchical clustering is taken care of in such a way so that Average Linkage and Complete Linkage with Jaccard and Hamming distance functions are applied separately in order to identify the virus strains as clusters present in the SNP data. In this regard, the consensus of both the clustering results are also considered while Silhouette index is used as a cluster validity index to measure the goodness of the clusters as well to determine the number of clusters or virus strains. As a result, we have identified five major clusters or virus strains present worldwide. Apart from quantitative measures, these clusters are also visualized using Visual Assessment of Tendency (VAT) plot. The evolution of these clusters are also shown. Furthermore, top 10 signature SNPs are identified in each cluster and the non-synonymous signature SNPs are visualised in the respective protein structures. Also, the sequence and structural homology-based prediction along with the protein structural stability of these non-synonymous signature SNPs are reported in order to judge the characteristics of the identified clusters. As a consequence, T85I, Q57H and R203M in NSP2, ORF3a and Nucleocapsid respectively are found to be responsible for Cluster 1 as they are damaging and unstable non-synonymous signature SNPs. Similarly, F506L and S507C in Exon are responsible for both Clusters 3 and 4 while Clusters 2 and 5 do not exhibit such behaviour due to the absence of any non-synonymous signature SNPs. In addition to all these, the code, SNP dataset, 10664 labelled SARS-CoV-2 strains and additional results as supplementary are provided through our website for further use.",

        "Abstract": "Whole genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 is important to identify its genetic diversity. Moreover, accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is required for its correct diagnosis. To address these, first we have analysed publicly available 10 664 complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries globally to find mutation points in the coding regions as substitution, deletion, insertion and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) globally and country wise. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment is performed in the presence of reference sequence from NCBI. Once the alignment is done, a consensus sequence is build to analyse each genomic sequence to identify the unique mutation points as substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs globally, thereby resulting in 7209, 11700, 119 and 53 such mutation points respectively. Second, in such categories, unique mutations for individual countries are determined with respect to other 72 countries. In case of India, unique 385, 867, 1 and 11 substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs are present in 566 SARS-CoV-2 genomes while 458, 1343, 8 and 52 mutation points in such categories are common with other countries. In majority (above 10%) of virus population, the most frequent and common mutation points between global excluding India and India are L37F, P323L, F506L, S507G, D614G and Q57H in NSP6, RdRp, Exon, Spike and ORF3a respectively. While for India, the other most frequent mutation points are T1198K, A97V, T315N and P13L in NSP3, RdRp, Spike and ORF8 respectively. These mutations are further visualised in protein structures and phylogenetic analysis has been done to show the diversity in virus genomes. Third, a web application is provided for searching mutation points globally and country wise. Finally, we have identified the potential conserved region as target that belongs to the coding region of ORF1ab, specifically to the NSP6 gene. Subsequently, we have provided the primers and probes using that conserved region so that it can be used for detecting SARS-CoV-2.

        "Abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is widely used to explore cortical physiology in health and disease. Surface electromyography (sEMG) is appropriate for superficial muscles, but cannot be applied easily to less accessible muscles. Muscle ultrasound (mUS) may provide an elegant solution to this problem, but fundamental questions remain. We explore the relationship between TMS evoked muscle potentials and TMS evoked muscle contractions measured with mUS.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission rate and shows frequent mutations, thus making vaccine development an arduous task. However, researchers around the globe are working hard to find a solution e.g. synthetic vaccine. Here, we have performed genome-wide analysis of 566 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes to extract the potential conserved regions for identifying peptide based synthetic vaccines, viz. epitopes with high immunogenicity and antigenicity. In this regard, different multiple sequence alignment techniques are used to align the SARS-CoV-2 genomes separately. Subsequently, consensus conserved regions are identified after finding the conserved regions from each aligned result of alignment techniques. Further, the consensus conserved regions are refined considering that their lengths are greater than or equal to 60nt and their corresponding proteins are devoid of any stop codons. Subsequently, their specificity as query coverage are verified using Nucleotide BLAST. Finally, with these consensus conserved regions, T-cell and B-cell epitopes are identified based on their immunogenic and antigenic scores which are then used to rank the conserved regions. As a result, we have ranked 23 consensus conserved regions that are associated with different proteins. This ranking also resulted in 34 MHC-I and 37 MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes with 16 and 19 unique HLA alleles and 29 B-cell epitopes. After ranking, the consensus conserved region from NSP3 gene is obtained that is highly immunogenic and antigenic. In order to judge the relevance of the identified epitopes, the physico-chemical properties and binding conformation of the MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes are shown with respect to HLA alleles.",

        "Abstract": "The interferon-induced tetratricopeptide repeat protein (Ifit2) protects mice from lethal neurotropic viruses. Neurotropic coronavirus MHV-RSA59 infection of Ifit2-/- mice caused pronounced morbidity and mortality accompanied by rampant virus replication and spread throughout the brain. In spite of the higher virus load, induction of many cytokines and chemokines in the brains of infected Ifit2-/- mice were similar to that in wild-type mice. In contrast, infected Ifit2-/- mice revealed significantly impaired microglial activation as well as reduced recruitment of NK1.1 T cells and CD4 T cells to the brain, possibly contributing to the lack of viral clearance. These two deficiencies were associated with a lower level of microglial expression of CX3CR1, the receptor of the CX3CL1 (Fractalkine) chemokine, which plays a critical role in both microglial activation and leukocyte recruitment. The above results uncovered a new potential role of an interferon-induced protein in immune protection.",

        "Abstract": "Surgeon providers and billing professionals use Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to specify patient treatment and associated charges. In the present study, coding discrepancies between surgeons' first pass coding and employed coders' final codes were investigated. A total of 500 patients over 3 months were retrospectively analyzed for coding discrepancies. To quantify the impact of change, codes with the most accumulated discrepancies were studied and change to annual relative value unit (RVU) was determined. Final submission of codes to billing demonstrated a 161% increase in total codes by the professional coders, versus original surgeon-derived codes (1594 vs 987 CPT codes). The most common source of change between the surgeon and coder was the addition of distinct codes by the billing professional (270 patients, 54.51%). These results demonstrate the existence of coding discrepancies. Future investigation will evaluate the communication between surgeons and billing professionals.",

Daily thousands of people are getting affected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus; India being no exception. In this situation, there is no doubt that vaccine is the primary prevention strategy to contain the wave of COVID-19 pandemic. In this regard, genome-wide analysis of SARS-CoV-2 is important to understand its genetic variability. This has motivated us to analyse 566 Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences using multiple sequence alignment techniques viz. ClustalW, MUSCLE, ClustalO and MAFFT to align and subsequently identify the lists of mutations as substitution, deletion, insertion and SNP. Thereafter, a consensus of these results, called as Consensus Multiple Sequence Alignment (CMSA), is prepared to have the final list of mutations so that the advantages of all four alignment techniques can be preserved. The analysis shows 767, 2025 and 54 unique substitutions, deletions and SNPs in Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes. More precisely, out of 54 SNPs, 4 SNPs are present close to the 60% of the virus population. The results of this experiment can be useful for virus classification, designing and defining the dose of vaccine for the Indian population.",

        "Abstract": "The wave of COVID-19 is a big threat to the human population. Presently, the world is going through different phases of lock down in order to stop this wave of pandemic; India being no exception. We have also started the lock down on 23rd March 2020. In this current situation, apart from social distancing only a vaccine can be the proper solution to serve the population of human being. Thus it is important for all the nations to perform the genome-wide analysis in order to identify the genetic variation in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) so that proper vaccine can be designed. This fast motivated us to analyze publicly available 566 Indian complete or near complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes to find the mutation points as substitution, deletion and insertion. In this regard, we have performed the multiple sequence alignment in presence of reference sequence from NCBI. After the alignment, a consensus sequence is built to analyze each genome in order to identify the mutation points. As a consequence, we have found 933 substitutions, 2449 deletions and 2 insertions, in total 3384 unique mutation points, in 566 genomes across 29.9\u00a0K\u00a0bp. Further, it has been classified into three groups as 100 clusters of mutations (mostly deletions), 1609 point mutations as substitution, deletion and insertion and 64 SNPs. These outcomes are visualized using BioCircos and bar plots as well as plotting entropy value of each genomic location. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis has also been performed to see the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus in India. It also shows the wide variation in tree which indeed vivid in genomic analysis. Finally, these SNPs can be the useful target for virus classification, designing and defining the effective dose of vaccine for the heterogeneous population.",

        "Title": "Toxicity of exhaust particulates and gaseous emissions from gasohol (ethanol blended gasoline)-fuelled spark ignition engines.",
        "Abstract": "In the last couple of decades, blending of oxygenated additives with gasoline has been advocated to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and to reduce hazardous health effects of gaseous emissions and particulate matter (PM) emitted by internal combustion (IC) engines in the transport sector worldwide. The primary objective of this research was to carry out a comparative analysis of exhaust PM emitted by gasohol (gasoline blended with 10% ethanol, v/v)-fulled spark ignition (SI) engine with that of baseline gasoline-fuelled SI engine. To assess the PM toxicity, physical, chemical and biological characterizations of PM were carried out using the state-of-the-art instruments and techniques. Measurements of regulated and unregulated gaseous species were also carried out at part/full loads. The results showed that the gasohol-fuelled engine emitted relatively lower concentrations of unregulated gaseous species such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), isocyanic acid (HNCO), etc. Physical characterization of exhaust particles revealed that the gasohol-fuelled engine emitted a significantly lower number of particles compared to the gasoline-fuelled engine. The presence of harmful polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and higher trace metal concentrations in PM emitted from the gasoline-fuelled engine was another important finding of this study. Biological characterizations showed that PM emitted from the gasohol-fuelled engine were less cytotoxic and had lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation potential. Mutagenicity of PM emitted from the gasohol-fuelled engine was also lower compared to that from the gasoline-fuelled engine. Overall, this study demonstrated that utilization of gasohol in SI engines led to the reduction in emissions, and lowering of PM toxicity, in addition to partial replacement of fossil fuels with renewable fuels.",

        "Abstract": "In a standard surgical operating room, advanced imaging is projected on a separate monitor screen away from the surgical field of view. This setup requires surgeons to repeatedly shift their attention between the operative field and a screen. Such movement may result in a disruption of focus that can extend surgical time, cause physical strain, and lead to surgical errors. A potential solution to this inefficiency in the surgical workflow is to use a heads-up display (HUD) to mirror what is being displayed. A HUD projects preoperative or intraoperative imaging over the surgical field, allowing surgeons to visualize both as they perform surgery.",

        "Abstract": "Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are rare, spindle cell neoplasms of the mesenchymal origin. Lesions localized to the spine are exceptionally uncommon, only described in the literature in case reports and small case series. While these lesions are typically benign, there are a few reports in which they recur or present as malignancies. The patient presented in the case herein was a 72-year-old male, who presented with a 1-year history of lower extremity weakness, pain, and numbness and was found to have a cervical, intradural extramedullary tumor. In addition to the case report, the authors perform a thorough review of all previously published cases of spinal SFT.",

The Dejour classification is currently considered the standard for classifying trochlear dysplasia, but numerous studies have reported poor reliability on both plain radiography and MRI. The severity of trochlear dysplasia is important to establish in order to guide surgical management. We have developed an MRI-specific classification system to assess the severity of trochlear dysplasia, the Oswestry-Bristol Classification (OBC). This is a four-part classification system comprising normal, mild, moderate, and severe to represent a normal, shallow, flat, and convex trochlear, respectively. The purpose of this study was to assess the inter- and intraobserver reliability of the OBC and compare it with that of the Dejour classification.",

        "Abstract": "The chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) GGGGCC repeat expansion has been associated with several diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. It has also been associated with increased white matter changes in frontotemporal dementia and risk of cognitive impairment in ALS. Dementia is common both before and after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Because the mechanisms of cognitive impairment in patients with ICH are uncertain, we investigated whether C9orf72 could influence dementia risk in this patient group. Therefore, we genotyped 1010 clinically characterized ICH cases and 2147 population controls in comparison with prior data of dementia and ALS cases. We did not find any association between C9orf72 repeat expansion and repeat size with ICH compared with controls or with dementia when assessing ICH patients only. The frequency of C9orf72 expansions in our series of individuals born in 1946 (2/2147) and other U.K. controls was age dependent, decreasing with increasing age, highlighting the high age-dependent penetrance of this expansion.",

Patients with CMI describe symptoms that are clearly correlated with CMI for an average of 3.1 years before diagnosis. We present a case of a patient with bilateral papilledema and CMI but with no long-standing CMI symptoms. She was initially diagnosed with a concussion but developed unremitting intense occipital headaches 4 days later which prompted an evaluation for an alternative diagnosis. Treatment of this case was ventriculoperitoneal shunting, which may serve as an alternative to posterior fossa decompression under certain circumstances.",

        "Abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations in CNTNAP2 cause a syndromic form of autism spectrum disorder in humans and produce social deficits, repetitive behaviors, and seizures in mice. However, the functional effects of these mutations at cellular and circuit levels remain\u00a0elusive. Using laser-scanning photostimulation, whole-cell recordings, and electron microscopy, we found a dramatic decrease in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of Cntnap2 knockout (KO) mice, concurrent with reduced spines and synapses, despite normal dendritic complexity and intrinsic excitability. Moreover, recording of mPFC local field potentials (LFPs) and unit spiking in\u00a0vivo revealed increased activity in inhibitory neurons, reduced phase-locking to delta and theta oscillations, and delayed phase preference during locomotion. Excitatory neurons showed similar phase modulation changes at delta frequencies. Finally, pairwise correlations increased during immobility in KO mice. Thus, reduced synaptic inputs can yield perturbed temporal coordination of neuronal firing in cortical ensembles.",

Brain imaging features of intracerebral haemorrhage and cerebral small vessel diseases (such as cerebral microbleeds) are associated with greater risks of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage. We did subgroup analyses of the RESTART trial to explore whether these brain imaging features modify the effects of antiplatelet therapy.",

We aimed to estimate the relative and absolute effects of antiplatelet therapy on recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage and whether this risk might exceed any reduction of occlusive vascular events.",

        "Abstract": "Neuronal activity-dependent transcription is tuned to ensure precise gene induction during periods of heightened synaptic activity, allowing for appropriate responses of activated neurons within neural circuits. The consequences of aberrant induction of activity-dependent genes on neuronal physiology are not yet clear. Here, we demonstrate that, in the absence of synaptic excitation, the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-PAS family transcription factor ARNT2 recruits the NCoR2 co-repressor complex to suppress neuronal activity-dependent regulatory elements and maintain low basal levels of inducible genes. This restricts inhibition of excitatory neurons, maintaining them in a state that is receptive to future\u00a0sensory stimuli. By contrast, in response to heightened neuronal activity, ARNT2 recruits the neuronal-specific bHLH-PAS factor NPAS4 to activity-dependent regulatory elements to induce transcription and thereby increase somatic inhibitory\u00a0input. Thus, the interplay of bHLH-PAS complexes at\u00a0activity-dependent regulatory elements maintains temporal control of activity-dependent gene expression and scales somatic inhibition with circuit activity.",

        "Abstract": "Biodiesel engines produce several intermediate species, which can potentially harm the human health. The concentration of these species and their health risk potential varies depending on engine technology, fuel, and engine operating condition. In this study, experiments were performed on a large number of engines having different configurations (emissions norms/fuel used), which were operated at part load/full load using B20 (20% v/v biodiesel blended with mineral diesel) and mineral diesel. Experiments included measurement of gaseous emissions, and physical, chemical, and biological characterization of exhaust particulate matter (PM). Chemical characterization of PM was carried out for detecting polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) and PM bound trace metals. The biological toxicity associated with PM was assessed using human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK 293T). The mutagenic potential of the PM was tested at three different concentrations (500, 100, and 50 \u03bcg/mL) using two different\u00a0 Salmonella strains, TA98 and TA100, with and without liver S9 metabolic enzyme fraction. PM samples exhibited cytotoxic effect on HEK 293T cells (IC",

        "Title": "Implications of anesthetic approach, spinal versus general, for the treatment of spinal disc herniation.",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVEHealthcare costs continue to escalate. Approaches to care that have comparable outcomes and complications are increasingly assessed for quality improvement and, when possible, cost containment. Efforts to identify components of care to reduce length of stay (LOS) have been ongoing. Spinal anesthesia (SA), for select lumbar spine procedures, has garnered interest as an alternative to general anesthesia (GA) that might reduce cost and in-hospital LOS and accelerate recovery. While clinical outcomes with SA or GA have been studied extensively, few authors have looked at the cost-analysis in relation to clinical outcomes. The authors' objectives were to compare the clinical perioperative outcomes of patients who received SA and GA, as well as the direct costs associated with each modality of care, and to determine which, in a retrospective analysis, can serve as a dominant procedural approach.METHODSThe authors retrospectively analyzed a homogeneous surgical population of 550 patients who underwent hemilaminotomy for disc herniation and who received either SA (n = 91) or GA (n = 459). All clinical and billing data were obtained via each patient's chart and the hospital's billing database, respectively. Additionally, the authors prospectively assessed patient-reported outcome measures for a subgroup of consecutively treated patients (n = 75) and compared quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains between the two cohorts. Furthermore, the authors performed a propensity score-matching analysis to compare the two cohorts (n = 180).RESULTSDirect hospital costs for patients receiving SA were 40% higher, in the hundreds of dollars, than for patients who received GA (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, there was a significant difference with regard to LOS (p < 0.0001), where patients receiving SA had a considerably longer hospital LOS (27.6% increase in hours). Patients undergoing SA had more comorbidities (p = 0.0053), specifically diabetes and hypertension. However, metrics of complications, including readmission (p = 0.3038) and emergency department (ED) visits at 30 days (p = 1.0), were no different. Furthermore, in a small pilot group, QALY gains were statistically no different (n = 75, p = 0.6708). Propensity score-matching analysis demonstrated similar results as the univariate analysis: there was no difference between the cohorts regarding 30-day readmission (p = 1.0000); ED within 30 days could not be analyzed as there were no patients in the SA group; and total direct costs and LOS were significantly different between the two cohorts (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0126, respectively).CONCLUSIONSBoth SA and GA exhibit the qualities of a good anesthetic, and the utilization of these modalities for lumbar spine surgery is safe and effective. However, this work suggests that SA is associated with increased LOS and higher direct costs, although these differences may not be clinically or fiscally meaningful.",

They are generally considered to be acquired lesions, often attributed to dural sinus thrombosis and intracranial venous hypertension. The authors encountered a case of DAVF associated with an octreotide-positive vestibular schwannoma.\u00a0A 46-year-old female had symptoms of right ear congestion accompanied by pulsatile tinnitus and mild hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified a lobulated mass centered at the cerebellopontine angle. Preoperatively, on cerebral angiography, there was an incidental discovery of a DAVF in the right posterior fossa. The decision was made to proceed with resection of the tumor in a staged fashion. Her latest follow-up MRI showed no evidence of recurrent tumor.\u00a0This is the second reported case of DAVF associated with an intracranial schwannoma. Findings are discussed along with a thorough review of the literature. This case, combined with the data from the literature review, led us to believe that tumor-related angiogenesis might contribute to DAVF formation.",

Two patients had a single GraftJacket repair (group1), whilst 18 had the GraftJacket sheet doubled (group2). Pre and post oxford shoulder scores (OSS) and patient related outcome measures were evaluated. A statistically significant improvement of OSS was demonstrated in-group 2 from a mean of 22 to 45.5 (p\u202f<\u202f0.00148) over a follow up of 18 months. GraftJacket is a safe and effective procedure to use as an interpositional graft and doubling the graft may improve outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Despite intensive research carried out on particulates, correlation between engine-out particulate emissions and adverse health effects is not well understood yet. Particulate emissions hold enormous significance for mega-cities like Delhi that have immense traffic diversity. Entire public transportation system involving taxis, three-wheelers, and buses has been switched from conventional liquid fuels to compressed natural gas (CNG) in the Mega-city of Delhi. In this study, the particulate characterization was carried out on variety of engines including three diesel engines complying with Euro-II, Euro-III and Euro-IV emission norms, one Euro-II gasoline engine and one Euro-IV CNG engine. Physical, chemical and biological characterizations of particulates were performed to assess the particulate toxicity. The mutagenic potential of particulate samples was investigated at different concentrations using two different Salmonella strains, TA98 and TA100 in presence and absence of liver S9 metabolic enzyme fraction. Particulates emitted from diesel and gasoline engines showed higher mutagenicity, while those from CNG engine showed negligible mutagenicity compared to other test fuels and engine configurations. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) adsorbed onto CNG engine particulates were also relatively fewer compared to those from equivalent diesel and gasoline engines. Taken together, our findings indicate that CNG is comparatively safer fuel compared to diesel and gasoline and can offer a cleaner transport energy solution for mega-cities with mixed-traffic conditions, especially in developing countries.",

        "Title": "Classifying nitrilases as aliphatic and aromatic using machine learning technique.",
        "Abstract": "ProCos (Protein Composition Server, script version), one of the machine learning techniques, was used to classify nitrilases as aliphatic and aromatic nitrilases. Some important feature vectors were used to train the algorithm, which included pseudo-amino acid composition (PAAC) and five-factor solution score (5FSS). This clearly differentiated into two groups of nitrilases, i.e., aliphatic and aromatic, achieving maximum sensitivity of 100.00%, specificity of 90.00%, accuracy of 95.00% and Mathew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of about 0.90 for the pseudo-amino acid composition. On the other hand, five-factor solution score achieved a sensitivity of 96.00%, specificity of 84.00%, accuracy of 90.00% and Mathew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of about 0.81. The total count of aliphatic amino acids, Ala (A), Gly (G), Leu (L), Ile (I), Val (V), Met (M) and Pro (P), was found to be higher, i.e., 42.7 in case of aliphatic nitrilases, whereas it was 40.1 in aromatic nitrilases. On the other hand, aromatic amino acids, Tyr (Y), Trp (W), His (H) and Phe (F) number, were found to be higher, i.e., 12.7 in aromatic nitrilases as compared to aliphatic nitrilases which was 10.7. This approach will help in predicting a nitrilase as aromatic or aliphatic nitrilase based on its amino acid sequence.

        "Title": "Associations of statin use with motor performance and myalgia may be modified by 25-hydroxyvitamin D: findings from a British birth cohort.",
        "Abstract": "The objective was to examine whether: (1) statin use was associated with muscle related outcomes at age 60-64, (2) these associations were modified by 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) status and explained by inflammation, body-size or lifestyle in a British birth cohort. Markers of myalgia (intrusive body pain) and myopathy\u00a0(self-reported and performance-based measures) were examined in 734 men and 822 women\u00a0(MRC National Survey of Health and Development). Statin use was associated with intrusive body pain, difficulty climbing stairs and slower chair rise speed. Some associations were modified by 25(OH)D e.g. the association with intrusive body pain was evident in the insufficient (13-20\u2009ng/l) and deficient\u00a0(<13\u2009ng/l) 25(OH)D status groups (OR\u2009=\u20092.6,95% CI 1.7-1.1; OR\u2009=\u20091.8,95% CI 1.2-2.8, respectively) but not in those with status >20\u2009ng/l (OR\u2009=\u20090.8,95% CI 0.5-1.4) (p\u2009=\u20090.003 for interaction). Associations were maintained in fully adjusted models of intrusive body pain and difficulty climbing stairs, but for chair rise speed they were fully accounted for by inflammation, body-size and lifestyle. In a nationally representative British population in early old age, statin use was associated with lower limb muscle-related outcomes, and some were only apparent in those with 25(OH)D status below 20\u2009ng/l. Given 25(OH)D is modifiable in clinical practice, future studies should consider the links between 25(OH)D status and muscle related outcomes.",

In the present communication in silico mining of microbial genomes has been carried out to find novel sources of nitrilases. The sequences selected were analyzed for homology and considered for designing motifs. The manually designed motifs based on amino acid sequences of nitrilases were used to screen 2000 microbial genomes (translated to proteomes). This resulted in identification of one hundred thirty-eight putative/hypothetical sequences which could potentially code for nitrilase activity. In vitro validation of nine predicted sources of nitrilases was done for nitrile/cyanide hydrolyzing activity. Out of nine predicted nitrilases, ",

        "Abstract": "Increasing age is the biggest risk factor for dementia, of which Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause. The pathological changes underpinning Alzheimer's disease are thought to develop at least a decade prior to the onset of symptoms. Molecular positron emission tomography and multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging allow key pathological processes underpinning cognitive impairment - including \u03b2-amyloid depostion, vascular disease, network breakdown and atrophy - to be assessed repeatedly and non-invasively. This enables potential determinants of dementia to be delineated earlier, and therefore opens a pre-symptomatic window where intervention may prevent the onset of cognitive symptoms.",

        "Abstract": "A life course approach to ageing relies on maintaining participation rates in national birth cohorts and other long-term longitudinal studies. This reduces the risk of selective attrition biasing associations between lifetime risk factors and health outcomes in later life and ensures the studies remain as representative as possible of the original population. We report the participation patterns for a postal questionnaire and home visit at 68-69\u00a0years of study members in the MRC National Survey of Health and Development, the oldest and longest-running British birth cohort study. We investigated how participation varied by lifetime and recent contact, health status, previous clinical feedback and study engagement, taking account of prior socioeconomic and cognitive characteristics. Overall participation and home visit participation remained high (94 and 80%, respectively) and there were no gender differences. Participation was higher in those with higher levels of prior contact and lower in those with the poorest health status. Having previously received clinical feedback on actionable blood results was associated with reduced home visit participation but other forms of clinical feedback were not associated with subsequent participation. Activities that fostered study engagement were associated with increased home visit participation. These findings inform strategies to maintain participation in life course studies.",

        "Abstract": "Sensory stimuli drive the maturation and function of the mammalian nervous system in part through the activation of gene expression networks that regulate synapse development and plasticity. These networks have primarily been studied in mice, and it is not known whether there are species- or clade-specific activity-regulated genes that control features of brain development and function. Here we use transcriptional profiling of human fetal brain cultures to identify an activity-dependent secreted factor, Osteocrin (OSTN), that is induced by membrane depolarization of human but not mouse neurons. We find that OSTN has been repurposed in primates through the evolutionary acquisition of DNA regulatory elements that bind the activity-regulated transcription factor MEF2. In addition, we demonstrate that OSTN is expressed in primate neocortex and restricts activity-dependent dendritic growth in human neurons. These findings suggest that, in response to sensory input, OSTN regulates features of neuronal structure and function that are unique to primates.",

        "Title": "\"Pilot Hole\" Technique for Interphalangeal Joint Fusion of Toes.",
        "Abstract": "Fusion of an interphalangeal joint of a lesser toe is a commonly used procedure for addressing interphalangeal joint deformities such as a hammer or a claw toe. Fusion can be achieved by insertion of an intramedullary Kirschner wire in a retrograde manner. Deviation of the Kirschner wire from the intramedullary canal into the surrounding soft tissues is common. This can render the fusion unstable and can cause painful soft-tissue irritation and early Kirschner wire loosening, resulting in an unstable nonunion with recurrence of deformity. We describe a simple and reproducible technique to assist with optimal intramedullary placement of the Kirschner wire, thereby reducing the risk of complications after interphalangeal joint fusion of a toe.",

        "Abstract": "Flaviviruses are emerging arthropod-borne viruses representing an immense global health problem. The prominent viruses of this group include dengue virus, yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus tick borne encephalitis virus and Zika Virus. These are endemic in many parts of the world. They are responsible for the illness ranging from mild flu like symptoms to severe hemorrhagic, neurologic and cognitive manifestations leading to death. NS1 is a highly conserved non-structural protein among flaviviruses, which exist in diverse forms. The intracellular dimer form of NS1 plays role in genome replication, whereas, the secreted hexamer plays role in immune evasion. The secreted NS1 has been identified as a potential diagnostic marker for early detection of the infections caused by flaviviruses. In addition to the diagnostic marker, the importance of NS1 has been reported in the development of therapeutics. NS1 based subunit vaccines are at various stages of development. The structural details and diverse functions of NS1 have been discussed in detail in this review.",

        "Title": "Implications of non-coding RNAs in viral infections.",
        "Abstract": "The advances in RNA sequencing have unveiled various non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which modulate the gene expression. ncRNAs do not get translated into proteins. These include transfer RNAs, ribosomal RNAs, microRNA (miRNA), short interfering RNA, long non-coding RNA, piwi-interacting RNA and small nuclear RNA. ncRNAs regulate gene expression at various levels and control cellular machinery. miRNAs have been reported in plants, animals, several invertebrates and viruses. The miRNAs regulate the gene expression post-transcriptionally. Viral infection strongly influences the abundance and the distribution of miRNAs and other ncRNAs within the host cells. Viruses may encode their own miRNA, which help in the viral life cycle and other aspects of pathogenesis. Viruses are known to successfully modulate the expression pattern of ncRNAs. The ncRNA-based strategies adopted by viruses for their survival present a complex picture of host-virus interactions. Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "Abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a plus strand RNA virus, which infects brain. MicroRNAs are regulatory non-coding RNAs which regulate the expression of various genes in cells. Viruses modulate the expression of various microRNAs to suppress anti-viral signaling and evade the immune response. SOCS (Suppressor of cytokine signalling) family of proteins are negative regulators of anti-viral Jak-STAT pathway. In this study, we demonstrated the regulatory role of SOCS5 in Jak-STAT signaling and its exploitation by JEV through a microRNA mediated mechanism. JEV infection in human brain microglial cells (CHME3) downregulated the expression of miR-432, and upregulated SOCS5 levels. SOCS5 was validated as a target of miR-432 by using 3'UTR clone of SOCS5 in luciferase vector along with miR-432 mimic. The overexpression of miR-432 prior to JEV infection enhanced the phosphorylation of STAT1 resulting into increased ISRE activity and cellular inflammatory response resulting into diminished viral replication. The knockdown of SOCS5 resulted into increased STAT1 phosphorylation and suppressed viral replication. JEV infection mediated downregulation of miR-432 leads to SOCS5 upregulation, which helps the virus to evade cellular anti-viral response. This study demonstrated that JEV utilizes this microRNA mediated strategy to manipulate cellular immune response promoting JEV pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the causative agent of Japanese encephalitis which is more prevalent in South and Southeast Asia. JEV is a neurotropic virus which infiltrates into the brain through vascular endothelial cells. JEV infects neurons and microglial cells which causes neuronal damage and inflammation. However, JEV also evades the cellular immune response to survive in host cells. Viruses are known to modulate the expression of microRNAs, which in turn modulate cellular immune response by targeting expression of antiviral genes. The aim of this study is to understand the anti-inflammatory role of miR-146a during JEV infection, which facilitates immune evasion.",

        "Abstract": "Out of various subtypes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), subtype B and C cause most of the infections worldwide. Clade specific differences have been reported in differences in clinical picture of HIV pathogenesis. Transcription of the HIV-1 genome is regulated by the interaction of HIV Tat protein to the trans-activation response (TAR) element. The differential binding of clade B and C Tat proteins to TAR and differences in activation of NF-\u03baB cascade leading to differential transactivation capacity and cytokine expression has been examined in this study. More stable Tat-TAR complex formation by Tat-C revealed by EMSA and higher TNF-\u03b1 expression shown by Tat-C compared to Tat-B leads to higher NF-\u03baB activation, which may be plausible cause for higher transactivation by Tat-C as obtained by FACS analysis. This comparative study would be helpful in understanding the basic mechanism of clade specific Tat protein differences and their functional relationships.",

        "Title": "Sex differences in renal and metabolic responses to a high-fructose diet in mice.",
        "Abstract": "High fructose intake has been associated with increased incidences of renal disease and hypertension, among other pathologies. Most fructose is cleared by the portal system and metabolized in the liver; however, systemic levels of fructose can rise with increased consumption. We tested whether there were sex differences in the renal responses to a high-fructose diet in mice. Two-month-old male and female C57BL6/129/SV mice (n = 6 mice per sex per treatment) were randomized to receive control or high-fructose (65% by weight) diets as pelleted chow ad libitum for 3 mo. Fructose feeding did not significantly affect body weight but led to a 19% and 10% increase in kidney weight in male and female mice, respectively. In male mice, fructose increased the expression (\u223c50%) of renal cortical proteins involved in metabolism, including glucose transporter 5 (facilitative fructose transporter), ketohexokinase, and the insulin receptor (\u03b2-subunit). Female mice had lower basal levels of glucose transporter 5, which were unresponsive to fructose. However, female mice had increased urine volume and plasma K(+) and decreased plasma Na(+) with fructose, whereas male mice were less affected. Likewise, female mice showed a two- to threefold reduction in the expression Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter 2 in the thick ascending limb and aquaporin-2 in the collecting duct with fructose relative to female control mice, whereas male mice had no change. Overall, our results support greater proximal metabolism of fructose in male animals and greater distal tubule/collecting duct (electrolyte homeostasis) alterations in female animals. These sex differences may be important determinants of the specific nature of pathologies that develop in association with high fructose consumption.",

        "Title": "Effects of healthy ageing on activation pattern within the primary motor cortex during movement and motor imagery: an fMRI study.",
        "Abstract": "The increase in older adults over the coming decades will be accompanied by a greater burden of chronic neurological diseases affecting the motor system. The motor system adapts to maintain motor performance with the primary motor cortex (BA4) emerging as a pivotal node within this neuroplastic process. Studies of ageing often consider BA4 a homogenous area but cytoarchitectonic studies have revealed two subdivisions, an anterior (BA4a) and posterior subdivision (BA4p). Here we focus upon the effects of ageing on the involvement of BA4a and BA4p during movement and motor imagery (MI). Thirty-one right-handed healthy volunteers were recruited and screened for their ability to perform imagery (5 subjects excluded). The sample was split into an older group (n = 13, mean age 56.4 SD 9.4) and a younger group (n = 13, mean age 27.4 SD 5.3). We used an fMRI block-design (auditory-paced [1 Hz] right hand finger-thumb opposition sequence [2,3,4,5, 2...]) with MI & rest and actual movement & rest. We explored the distribution-based clustering and weighted laterality index within BA4a and BA4p. The involvement of BA4p during MI (measured with distribution-based clustering) was significantly greater in the older group (p<0.05) than in the younger group. Hemispheric balance of BA4p decreased with age during MI (Spearman rho -0.371; p<0.05), whereas that of BA4a decreased with age during actual movement (Spearman rho =\u200a-0.458 p<0.01). Irrespective of age, we found BA4 is involved during motor imagery, strengthening the rationale for its potential use in older subjects. These findings suggest that the functions of the subdivisions of BA4 are differentially affected by ageing and have implications regarding how ageing affects the cognitive processes underlying motor functions.",

Eighteen microbial \u03b2 -galactosidase protein sequences, six each from psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic microbes, were analyzed. Primary structure reveals alanine, glycine, serine, and arginine to be higher in psychrophilic \u03b2 -galactosidases whereas valine, glutamine, glutamic acid, phenylalanine, threonine, and tyrosine are found to be statistically preferred by thermophilic \u03b2 -galactosidases. Cold active \u03b2 -galactosidase has a strong preference towards tiny and small amino acids, whereas high temperature inhabitants had higher content of basic and aromatic amino acids. Thermophilic \u03b2 -galactosidases have higher percentage of \u03b1 -helix region responsible for temperature tolerance while cold loving \u03b2 -galactosidases had higher percentage of sheet and coil region. Secondary structure analysis revealed that charged and aromatic amino acids were significant for sheet region of thermophiles. Alanine was found to be significant and high in the helix region of psychrophiles and valine counters in thermophilic \u03b2 -galactosidase. Coil region of cold active \u03b2 -galactosidase has higher content of tiny amino acids which explains their high catalytic efficiency over their counterparts from thermal habitat. The present study has revealed the preference or prevalence of certain amino acids in primary and secondary structure of psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic \u03b2 -galactosidase.",

This cycle involves pigs as the major reservoir, water birds as carriers and mosquitoes as vectors. JEV invasion into the central nervous system (CNS) may occur via antipodal transport of virions or through the vascular endothelial cells. Microglial cells get activated in response to pathogenic insults. JEV infection induces the innate immune response and triggers the production of type I interferons. The signaling pathway of type I interferon production is regulated by a number of molecules. TRIM proteins are known to regulate the expression of interferons; however, the involvement of TRIM genes and their underlying mechanism during JEV infection are not known.",

        "Abstract": "A heterogeneous population of inhibitory neurons controls the flow of information through a neural circuit. Inhibitory synapses that form on pyramidal neuron dendrites modulate the summation of excitatory synaptic potentials and prevent the generation of dendritic calcium spikes. Precisely timed somatic inhibition limits both the number of action potentials and the time window during which firing can occur. The activity-dependent transcription factor NPAS4 regulates inhibitory synapse number and function in cell culture, but how this transcription factor affects the inhibitory inputs that form on distinct domains of a neuron in vivo was unclear. Here we show that in the mouse hippocampus behaviourally driven expression of NPAS4 coordinates the redistribution of inhibitory synapses made onto a CA1 pyramidal neuron, simultaneously increasing inhibitory synapse number on the cell body while decreasing the number of inhibitory synapses on the apical dendrites. This rearrangement of inhibition is mediated in part by the NPAS4 target gene brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), which specifically regulates somatic, and not dendritic, inhibition. These findings indicate that sensory stimuli, by inducing NPAS4 and its target genes, differentially control spatial features of neuronal inhibition in a way that restricts the output of the neuron while creating a dendritic environment that is permissive for plasticity.",

Conventional fMRI modeling has shown that MI and executed movement (EM) activate similar cortical areas but it remains unknown whether they share cortical networks.

        "Abstract": "Hyponatremia has long been associated with worsened clinical outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and those awaiting liver transplant. However, in the last several years, new modalities of therapy, particularly aquaretics known as \"vaptans,\" and comprehensive prognostic models have been increasingly studied in the hopes of bolstering serum sodium levels and altering liver transplant candidate status. To examine the most recent, comprehensive, and pertinent data, a systematic review of both prospective and retrospective studies available on MEDLINE was completed, which provided information detailing clinical associations, treatment, and prognoses seen in those with hyponatremia in cirrhosis. Clinical associations with hyponatremia in cirrhosis including hepatorenal syndrome and hepatic encephalopathy were identified. For hyponatremia in those awaiting liver transplant, tolvaptan is an effective agent in temporarily normalizing serum sodium levels with minimal risk of osmotic demyelination. Prognostic models incorporating serum sodium levels were better able to predict urgency and need for transplant; yet the benefits and posttransplant effects of redefining a liver allocation score have yet to be established.",

At the cellular level, we discuss basic changes in membrane excitability, synaptic plasticity as well as structural changes in dendritic and axonal anatomy that support behavioral expressions of plasticity and functional recovery. We consider the different levels at which these changes can occur and possible links with modification of cognitive strategies, recruitment of new/different neural networks, or changes in strength of such connections or specific brain areas in charge of carrying out a particular task (i.e., movement, language, vision, hearing). The study of neuroplasticity has wide-reaching implications for understanding reorganization of action and cognition in the healthy and lesioned brain.",

        "Title": "Comparative analysis of amino acid sequences from mesophiles and thermophiles in respective of carbon-nitrogen hydrolase family.",
        "Abstract": "A comparative study of amino acid sequence and physicochemical properties indicates the affiliation of protein from the nitrilase/cyanide hydratase family. This family contains nitrilases that break carbon-nitrogen bonds and appear to be involved in the reduction of organic nitrogen compounds and ammonia production. They all have distinct substrate specificity and include nitrilase, cyanide hydratases, aliphatic amidases, beta-alanine synthase, and a few other proteins with unknown molecular function. These sequences were analyzed for different physical and chemical properties and to relate these observed differences to the thermostability properties, phylogenetic tree construction and the evolutionary relationship among them. In this work, in silico analysis of amino acid sequences of mesophilic (15) and thermophilic (archaea, 15 and bacteria, 15) proteins has been done. The physiochemical properties of these three groups of nitrilase/cyanide hydratase family also differ in number of amino acids, molecular weight, pI values, positively charged ions, i.e. Arg\u00a0+\u00a0Lys, aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathacity (GRAVY). The amino acid Ala (1.37-fold) was found to be higher in mesophilic bacteria as compared to thermophilic bacteria but Lys and Phe were found to be significantly high (1.43 and 1.39-fold, respectively) in case of thermophilic bacteria. The amino acids Ala, Cys, Gln, His and Thr were found to be significantly higher (1.41, 1.6, 1.77, 1.44 and 1.29-fold, respectively) in mesophilic bacteria as compared to thermophilic archaea, where Glu, Leu and Val were found significantly high (1.22, 1.19 and 1.26-fold, respectively).",

        "Abstract": "EphB receptor tyrosine kinases control multiple steps in nervous system development. However, it remains unclear whether EphBs regulate these different developmental processes directly or indirectly. In addition, given that EphBs signal through multiple mechanisms, it has been challenging to define which signaling functions of EphBs regulate particular developmental events. To address these issues, we engineered triple knock-in mice in which the kinase activity of three neuronally expressed EphBs can be rapidly, reversibly and specifically blocked. We found that the tyrosine kinase activity of EphBs was required for axon guidance in vivo. In contrast, EphB-mediated synaptogenesis occurred normally when the kinase activity of EphBs was inhibited, suggesting that EphBs mediate synapse development by an EphB tyrosine kinase-independent mechanism. Taken together, our data indicate that EphBs control axon guidance and synaptogenesis by distinct mechanisms and provide a new mouse model for dissecting EphB function in development and disease.",

        "Title": "Development of an experimental model to study the pathophysiology of cerebral salt wasting following subarachnoid hemorrhage.",
        "Abstract": "Hyponatremia is frequent following cranial -neurosurgery or acute brain injury like subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and increases mortality by 30%. The patho-physiology is not understood nor does a causal therapy exist. Since clinical trials are potentially dangerous in this very ill population, we examined whether an established rat model allows studying cerebral salt wasting (CSW) following SAH. The daily urine sodium excretion as well as plasma sodium, osmolality and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels were measured for 10 days. Following the injection of 300 \u03bcl of blood into the great cistern (SAH(severe)), natriuresis peaked twice (days 1 and 3-5, p < 0.05) resulting in a plasma sodium nadir (day 1 - 133.9 mmol/L, day 5 - 132.6 mmol/L), while following the injection of 300 \u03bcL saline (ICP(control)), natriuresis occurred delayed on days 4-5 (p < 0.05). Following double SAH (200 \u03bcL twice, 24 h apart), a natriuresis on day 4 resulted in a hyponatremia (131.7 mmol/L, p = 0.025). Neither SAH(mild) (100 \u03bcL), the injection of hemolyzed blood (100 \u03bcL) or hypertonic saline (200 \u03bcL) replicated the effect. The immediate release of ADH (32.23 \u00b1 34.87 pg/mL) following SAH(severe) normalized over the next few days. We conclude that first, the rat model of SAH is suitable for studying CSW, second the increase in intracranial pressure generates the delayed hyponatremia, and third, the ADH release does not mediate natriuresis.",

        "Abstract": "The human brain possesses a remarkable ability to adapt in response to changing anatomical (e.g., aging) or environmental modifications. This form of neuroplasticity is important at all stages of life but is critical in neurological disorders such as amblyopia and stroke. This review focuses upon our new understanding of possible mechanisms underlying functional deficits evidenced after adult-onset stroke. We review the functional interactions between different brain regions that may contribute to motor disability after stroke and, based on this information, possible interventional approaches to motor stroke disability. New information now points to the involvement of non-primary motor areas and their interaction with the primary motor cortex as areas of interest. The emergence of this new information is likely to impact new efforts to develop more effective neurorehabilitative interventions using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) that may be relevant to other neurological disorders such as amblyopia.",

        "Abstract": "Professional athletes are taking concussion very seriously, and missed play due to concussion is no longer stigmatized. One fortuitous consequence is increased awareness of the detrimental effects of concussion among student athletes. Whereas professional athletes have access to formal in-competition evaluation and out-of-competition monitoring programs, the majority of student athletes, especially at the middle school and high school levels, do not. The authors therefore set out to create an easy-to-use iPhone application for sideline concussion testing and serial monitoring of these at-risk athletes.",

        "Abstract": "Many information portals are adding social features with hopes of enhancing the overall user experience. Invitations to join and welcome pages that highlight these social features are expected to encourage use and participation. While this approach is widespread and seems plausible, the effect of providing and highlighting social features remains to be tested. We studied the effects of emphasizing social features on users' response to invitations, their decisions to join, their willingness to provide profile information, and their engagement with the portal's social features. The results of a quasi-experiment found no significant effect of social emphasis in invitations on receivers' responsiveness. However, users receiving invitations highlighting social benefits were less likely to join the portal and provide profile information. Social emphasis in the initial welcome page for the site also was found to have a significant effect on whether individuals joined the portal, how much profile information they provided and shared, and how much they engaged with social features on the site. Unexpectedly, users who were welcomed in a social manner were less likely to join and provided less profile information; they also were less likely to engage with social features of the portal. This suggests that even in online contexts where social activity is an increasingly common feature, highlighting the presence of social features may not always be the optimal presentation strategy.",

        "Abstract": "We value skills we have learned intentionally, but equally important are skills acquired incidentally without ability to describe how or what is learned, referred to as implicit. Randomized practice schedules are superior to grouped schedules for long-term skill gained intentionally, but its relevance for implicit learning is not known. In a parallel design, we studied healthy subjects who learned a motor sequence implicitly under randomized or grouped practice schedule and obtained diffusion-weighted images to identify white matter microstructural correlates of long-term skill. Randomized practice led to superior long-term skill compared with grouped practice. Whole-brain analyses relating interindividual variability in fractional anisotropy (FA) to long-term skill demonstrated that 1) skill in randomized learners correlated with FA within the corticostriatal tract connecting left sensorimotor cortex to posterior putamen, while 2) skill in grouped learners correlated with FA within the right forceps minor connecting homologous regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the corticostriatal tract connecting lateral PFC to anterior putamen. These results demonstrate first that randomized practice schedules improve long-term implicit skill more than grouped practice schedules and, second, that the superior skill acquired through randomized practice can be related to white matter microstructure in the sensorimotor corticostriatal network.",

        "Title": "Sex differences in vasopressin V\u2082 receptor expression and vasopressin-induced antidiuresis.",
        "Abstract": "The renal vasopressin V(2) receptor (V(2)R) plays a critical role in physiological and pathophysiological processes associated with arginine vasopressin (AVP)-induced antidiuresis. Because clinical data suggests that females may be more prone to hyponatremia from AVP-mediated antidiuresis, we investigated whether there are sex differences in the expression and function of the renal V(2)R. In normal Sprague-Dawley rat kidneys, V(2)R mRNA and protein expression was 2.6- and 1.7-fold higher, respectively, in females compared with males. To investigate the potential physiological implications of this sex difference, we studied changes in urine osmolality induced by the AVP V(2)R agonist desmopressin. In response to different doses of desmopressin, there was a graded increase in urine osmolality and decrease in urine volume during a 24-h infusion. Females showed greater mean increases in urine osmolality and greater mean decreases in urine volume at 0.5 and 5.0 ng/h infusion rates. We also studied renal escape from antidiuresis produced by water loading in rats infused with desmopressin (5.0 ng/h). After 5 days of water loading, urine osmolality of both female and male rats escaped to the same degree physiologically, but V(2)R mRNA and protein in female kidneys was reduced to a greater degree (-63% and -73%, respectively) than in males (-32% and -48%, respectively). By the end of the 5-day escape period, renal V(2)R mRNA and protein expression were reduced to the same relative levels in males and females, thereby abolishing the sex differences in V(2)R expression seen in the basal state. Our results demonstrate that female rats express significantly more V(2)R mRNA and protein in kidneys than males, and that this results physiologically in a greater sensitivity to V(2)R agonist administration. The potential pathophysiological implications of these results are that females may be more susceptible to the development of dilutional hyponatremia because of a greater sensitivity to endogenously secreted AVP.",

        "Abstract": "Electrospinning constitutes a simple and versatile approach of fabricating polymer heterostructures composed of nanofibers. A preferred alignment of polymer crystallites stems from complex shear elongational forces and generates a strong intrinsic optical anisotropy in typical electrospun fibers of semicrystalline polymers. While it can prove useful for certain devices, this intrinsic anisotropy can be extremely detrimental for other key applications such as high-performance polymer-based lighting and solar-energy harvesting platforms. We report a dramatic reduction in the intrinsic dichroism of electrospun poly(ethylene oxide) fibers resulting from the incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles in the polymer matrix. This effect is shown to originate from a controllable randomization of the orientational ordering of the crystalline domains in the hybrid nanofibers and not merely from a reduction in crystallinity. This improved understanding of the crystalline structure-optical property correlation then leads to a better control over the intrinsic anisotropy of electrospun fibers using localized surface-plasmon enhancement effects around metallic nanoparticles.",

        "Abstract": "We report a role for long-distance retrograde neurotrophin signaling in the establishment of synapses in the sympathetic nervous system. Target-derived NGF is both necessary and sufficient for formation of postsynaptic specializations on dendrites of sympathetic neurons. This, in turn, is a prerequisite for formation of presynaptic specializations, but not preganglionic axonal ingrowth from the spinal cord into sympathetic ganglia. We also find that NGF-TrkA signaling endosomes travel from distal axons to cell bodies and dendrites where they promote PSD clustering. Furthermore, the p75 neurotrophin receptor restricts PSD formation, suggesting an important role for antagonistic NGF-TrkA and p75 signaling pathways during retrograde control of synapse establishment. Thus, in addition to defining the appropriate number of sympathetic neurons that survive the period of developmental cell death, target-derived NGF also exerts control over the degree of connectivity between the spinal cord and sympathetic ganglia through retrograde control of synapse assembly.",

The structural characterization of the fiber encapsulated nanoparticle arrays via electron microscopy has been detailed, and the magnetic behavior has been studied using vibrating sample magnetometry. The fiber encapsulated nanoparticle arrays exhibit orientation-dependent magnetic behavior with respect to the applied magnetic field. A strong anisotropy along orthogonal axes is obtained for aligned arrays and is manifested as a notable increase in the coercivity and remanence magnetization in the parallel field configuration. The magnetic behavior of isotropic fibers is also examined as a reference and no orientation dependence is observed. The results were found to corroborate theoretical predictions from the chain-of-spheres model. Such hybrid nanoparticle arrays may find relevance in applications requiring an orientation-dependent physical response and in the directional transfer of signals.",

This template-defined approach toward biomineralization was utilized for the controlled fabrication of 3D hybrid nanostructures. The peptides MAX1 and MAX8 used herein form networks consisting of interconnected, self-assembled beta-sheet fibrils. We report a study on the structure--property relationship of self-assembled peptide hydrogels where mineralization of individual fibrils through sol--gel chemistry was achieved. The nanostructure and consequent mechanical characteristics of these hybrid networks can be modulated by changing the stoichiometric parameters of the sol--gel process. The physical characterization of the hybrid networks via electron microscopy and small-angle scattering is detailed and correlated with changes in the network mechanical behavior. The resultant high fidelity templating process suggests that the peptide substrate can be used to template the coating of other functional inorganic materials.",

        "Title": "The neural substrates of impaired finger tapping regularity after stroke.",
        "Abstract": "Not only finger tapping speed, but also tapping regularity can be impaired after stroke, contributing to reduced dexterity. The neural substrates of impaired tapping regularity after stroke are unknown. Previous work suggests damage to the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and prefrontal cortex (PFCx) affects externally-cued hand movement. We tested the hypothesis that these two areas are involved in impaired post-stroke tapping regularity. In 19 right-handed patients (15 men/4 women; age 45-80 years; purely subcortical in 16) partially to fully recovered from hemiparetic stroke, tri-axial accelerometric quantitative assessment of tapping regularity and BOLD fMRI were obtained during fixed-rate auditory-cued index-thumb tapping, in a single session 10-230 days after stroke. A strong random-effect correlation between tapping regularity index and fMRI signal was found in contralesional PMd such that the worse the regularity the stronger the activation. A significant correlation in the opposite direction was also present within contralesional PFCx. Both correlations were maintained if maximal index tapping speed, degree of paresis and time since stroke were added as potential confounds. Thus, the contralesional PMd and PFCx appear to be involved in the impaired ability of stroke patients to fingertap in pace with external cues. The findings for PMd are consistent with repetitive TMS investigations in stroke suggesting a role for this area in affected-hand movement timing. The inverse relationship with tapping regularity observed for the PFCx and the PMd suggests these two anatomically-connected areas negatively co-operate. These findings have implications for understanding the disruption and reorganization of the motor systems after stroke.",

        "Abstract": "Neuroplasticity is essential for recovery after stroke and is the target for new stroke therapies. During recovery from subcortical motor stroke, brain activations associated with movement may appear normal despite residual functional impairment. This raises an important question: how far does recovery of motor performance depend on the processes that precede movement execution involving the premotor and prefrontal cortex, rather than recovery of the corticospinal system alone?",

To delineate the molecular basis, we compared the expression of nine functional gene modules (total 578 genes) that regulate major positive growth and negative inhibitory signals in normal breast with two other reproductive tissues, ovary and uterus. We present data to demonstrate that breast tissues constitutively have very highly elevated levels of several growth promoting molecules and diminished levels of inhibitory molecules which may, in part, contribute for highest incidence of tumor growths in this tissue.",

        "Abstract": "Insulin resistance is associated with hypertension by mechanisms likely involving the kidney. To determine how the major apical sodium transporter of the thick ascending limb, the bumetanide-sensitive Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) is regulated by high-fat feeding, we treated young male, Fischer 344 X Brown Norway (F344BN) rats for 8 wk with diets containing either normal (NF, 4%) or high (HF, 36%) fat, by weight, primarily as lard. HF-fed rats had impaired glucose tolerance, increased urine excretion of 8-isoprostane (a marker of oxidative stress), increased protein levels for NKCC2 (50-125%) and the renal outer medullary potassium channel (106%), as well as increased natriuretic response to furosemide (20-40%). To test the role of oxidative stress in this response, in study 2, rats were fed the NF or HF diet plus plain drinking water, or water containing N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (100 mg/l), or tempol, a superoxide dismutase mimetic (1 mmol/l). The combination of tempol with HF nullified the increase in medullary NKCC2, while l-NAME with HF led to the highest expression of medullary NKCC2 (to 498% of NF mean). However, neither of these drugs dramatically affected the elevated natriuretic response to furosemide with HF. Finally, l-NAME led to a marked increase in blood pressure (measured by radiotelemetry), which was significantly enhanced with HF. Mean arterial blood pressure at 7 wk was as follows (mmHg): NF, 100 +/- 2; NF plus l-NAME, 122 +/- 3; and HF plus l-NAME, 131 +/- 2. Overall, HF feeding increased the abundance of NKCC2. Inappropriately high sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb via NKCC2 may contribute to hypertension with insulin resistance.",

        "Abstract": "Renal tubule epithelial cells express the insulin receptor (IR); however, their value has not been firmly established. We generated mice with renal epithelial cell-specific knockout of the IR by Cre-recombinase-loxP recombination using a kidney-specific (Ksp) cadherin promoter. KO mice expressed significantly lower levels of IR mRNA and protein in kidney cortex (49-56% of the WT) and medulla (32-47%) homogenates. Immunofluorescence showed the greatest relative reduction in the thick ascending limb and collecting duct cell types. Body weight, kidney weight, and food and water intakes were not different from WT littermates. However, KO mice had significantly increased basal systolic blood pressure (BP, 15 mm Hg higher) as measured by radiotelemetry. In response to a volume load by gavage (20 ml/kg of body weight, 0.9% NaCl, 15% dextrose), KO mice had impaired natriuresis (37 +/- 10 versus 99 +/- 9 mmol of Na(+) per 2 h in WT). Furthermore, volume load led to a sustained increase in BP in KO mice only. In contrast, insulin administration i.p. (0.5 units/kg of body weight) resulted in a significant fall in BP in WT, but not in KO mice. To test the role of reduced renal nitric oxide (NO) production in these responses, basal urinary nitrates plus nitrites excretion (UNOx) was measured and found to be 61% lower in KO vs. WT mice. Furthermore, acute insulin increased UNOx by 202% in the WT, relative to a significantly blunted rise (67%) in KO animals. These results illuminate a previously uncharacterized role for renal IR to reduce BP and facilitate sodium and water excretion, possibly via NO production.",

        "Abstract": "Motor Imagery (MI) is an attractive but intriguing means to access the motor network. There are marked inconsistencies in the functional imaging literature regarding the degree, extent and distribution of the primary motor cortex (BA 4) involvement during MI as compared to Executed Movement (EM), which may in part be related to the diverse role of BA 4 and its two subdivisions (i.e., 4a and 4p) in motor processes as well as to methodological issues. Here we used fMRI with monitoring of compliance to show that in healthy volunteers optimally screened for their ability to perform MI the contralateral BA 4 is involved during MI of a finger opposition sequence (2, 3, 4, 5; paced at 1 Hz), albeit less than during EM of the same sequence, and in a location sparing the hand area. Furthermore, both 4a and 4p subdivisions were found to be involved in MI, but the relative involvement of BA 4p appeared more robust and closer to that seen with EM. We suggest that during MI the role of BA 4 and its subdivisions may be non-executive, perhaps related to spatial encoding, though clearly further studies are needed. Finally, we report a similar hemispheric activation balance within BA 4 with both tasks, which extends the commonalities between EM and MI.",

        "Abstract": "We report that developmental competition between sympathetic neurons for survival is critically dependent on a sensitization process initiated by target innervation and mediated by a series of feedback loops. Target-derived nerve growth factor (NGF) promoted expression of its own receptor TrkA in mouse and rat neurons and prolonged TrkA-mediated signals. NGF also controlled expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-4, which, through the receptor p75, can kill neighboring neurons with low retrograde NGF-TrkA signaling whereas neurons with high NGF-TrkA signaling are protected. Perturbation of any of these feedback loops disrupts the dynamics of competition. We suggest that three target-initiated events are essential for rapid and robust competition between neurons: sensitization, paracrine apoptotic signaling, and protection from such effects.",

        "Abstract": "Functional imaging during movement of the hand affected by a stroke has shown excess activation of the contralesional motor network, implying less physiological hemisphere activation balance. Although this may be adaptive, the relationship between the severity of motor deficit and the hemisphere activation balance for the four major cortical motor areas has not been systematically studied. We prospectively studied 19 right-handed patients with first-ever stroke (age range 61+/-10 years) in the stable phase of recovery (>3 months after onset), using auditory-paced index-thumb (IT) tapping of the affected hand at 1.25 Hz as the fMRI paradigm. The hemisphere activation balance for the primary motor (M1), primary somatosensory (S1), supplementary motor (SMA) and dorsal premotor (PMd) areas was measured by a modified weighted laterality index (wLI), and correlations with motor performance (assessed by the affected/unaffected ratio of maximum IT taps in 15 s, termed IT-R) were computed. There were statistically significant negative correlations between IT-R and the wLI for M1 and S1, such that the more the hemispheric balance shifted contralesionally, the worse the performance. Furthermore, worse performance was related to a greater amount of contralesional, but not ipsilesional, activation. No significant correlation between IT-R and the wLI was obtained for the SMA and PMd, which functionally have stronger bilateral organization. These findings suggest that the degree of recovery of fine finger motion after stroke is determined by the extent to which activation balance in the primary sensory motor areas--where most corticospinal fibers originate--departs from normality. This observation may have implications for therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects and transforms resting B lymphocytes in vitro. The virus can also cause B cell lymphomas in immunosuppressed humans. Indeed, EBV-mediated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease causes significant complications in transplant recipients, including loss of the transplanted organ and even death. The limited treatment options include, nonspecific targeting of B cell surface antigens with monoclonal antibodies or withdrawal of immunosuppression. These therapies fail in approximately 50% of patients. Clearly, treatments that specifically target EBV-infected cells are desirable. The EBV antigen EBNA3C regulates cell cycle by targeting critical cellular complexes such as cyclin A/cdk2, SCF(Skp2), and Rb. Here, we use a 20-amino-acid EBNA3C-derived peptide, fused to an HIV TAT tag for efficient delivery, to disrupt cell cycle regulation by EBNA3C. The peptide inhibited hyperproliferation of EBV-infected B cell lines and reduced in vitro immortalization of primary B lymphocytes by EBV. Importantly, the peptide inhibited lymphoblastoid outgrowth from the blood of an EBV-positive transplant patient in vitro.",

        "Abstract": "The gammaherpesviruses Rhesus lymphocryptovirus (LCV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are closely related phylogenetically. Rhesus LCV efficiently immortalizes Rhesus B cells in vitro. However, despite a high degree of conservation between the Rhesus LCV and EBV genomes, Rhesus LCV fails to immortalize human B cells in vitro. This species restriction may, at least in part, be linked to the EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs) and latent membrane proteins (LMPs), known to be essential for B cell transformation. We compared specific properties of EBNA3C, a well-characterized and essential EBV protein, with its Rhesus counterpart to determine whether EBNA3C phenotypes which contribute to cell cycle regulation are conserved in the Rhesus LCV. We show that both EBNA3C and Rhesus EBNA3C bind to a conserved region of mammalian cyclins, regulate pRb stability, and modulate SCF(Skp2)-dependent ubiquitination. These results suggest that Rhesus LCV restriction from human B cell immortalization is independent of the conserved cell cycle regulatory functions of the EBNA3C protein.",

        "Abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) stimulates the proliferation of latently infected B cells and promotes lymphoid malignancies in humans. To address the role of EBV latency protein Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) in regulation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), we transfected EBNA3C into 293, BJAB, and SAOS-2 cells. In this context, a dominant effect of EBNA3C is to decrease Rb protein levels. EBNA3C also rescues an Rb-induced flat cell phenotype and targets Rb for proteasome- and ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Further, EBNA3C forms a stable complex with Rb in cells when the proteasome machinery is inhibited and interacts with Rb in vitro, mapping to a conserved domain at the terminus of EBNA3C. Deletion analysis of EBNA3C identified a motif within amino acids 140-149 important for both the binding and regulation of Rb. This motif is of particular interest, because it has also been linked to regulation of the Skp1/Cul1/F-box complex, SCF(Skp2). Indeed, inhibition of Skp2 function with a dominant-negative molecule reduces the ability of EBNA3C to degrade Rb. Skp2 has no detectable effect on Rb levels in the absence of EBNA3C, suggesting that SCF(Skp2) is specifically usurped by EBNA3C for the enhancement of Rb degradation. That EBNA3C has exploited this association suggests that other human malignancies might use a similar strategy to regulate the Rb protein.",

        "Abstract": "Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiological agent contributing to development of Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman desease. Following primary infection, latency is typically established. However, the mechanism by which KSHV establishes latency is not understood. We have reported that the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) can repress RTA (for replication and transcription activator) expression by down-regulating its promoter. In this study, we show that RTA is associated with the virion particle. We also show that RTA can activate the LANA promoter and induce LANA expression in transient reporter assays. Additionally, the transcription of RTA correlates with LANA expression in the early stages of de novo infection of KSHV, and induction of LANA transcription is responsive to induction of RTA with an inducible system. This induction in LANA transcription was dependent on recombination signal sequence binding protein Jkappa (RBP-Jkappa), as a RBP-Jkappa-deficient cell line was significantly delayed and inefficient in LANA transcription with expression of RTA. These studies suggest that RTA contributes to establishment of KSHV latency by activating LANA expression in the early stages of infection by utilizing the major effector of the Notch signaling pathway RBP-Jkappa. This describes a feedback mechanism by which LANA and RTA can regulate each other and is likely to be a key event in the establishment of KSHV latency.",

        "Title": "SCFSkp2 complex targeted by Epstein-Barr virus essential nuclear antigen.",
        "Abstract": "The stability of cell cycle checkpoint and regulatory proteins is controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation machinery. A critical regulator of cell cycle molecules is the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFSkp2, known to facilitate the polyubiquitination and degradation of p27, E2F, and c-myc. SCFSkp2 is frequently deregulated in human cancers. In this study, we have revealed a novel link between the essential Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen EBNA3C and the SCFSkp2 complex, providing a mechanism for cell cycle regulation by EBV. EBNA3C associates with cyclin A/cdk2 complexes, disrupting the kinase inhibitor p27 and enhancing kinase activity. The recruitment of SCFSkp2 activity to cyclin A complexes by EBNA3C results in ubiquitination and SCFSkp2-dependent degradation of p27. This is the first report of a viral protein usurping the function of the SCFSkp2 cell cycle regulatory machinery to regulate p27 stability, establishing the foundation for a mechanism by which EBV regulates cyclin/cdk activity in human cancers.",

        "Title": "A cyclin-binding motif within the amino-terminal homology domain of EBNA3C binds cyclin A and modulates cyclin A-dependent kinase activity in Epstein-Barr virus-infected cells.",
        "Abstract": "The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) is a virus-encoded latent antigen essential for primary B-cell transformation. In this report we demonstrate that although the carboxy terminus of EBNA3C predominantly regulates cyclin A-dependent kinase activity, the region of greatest affinity for cyclin A lies within the EBNA3 amino-terminal homology domain of EBNA3C. Detailed mapping studies employing both in vitro binding assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments implicated a small region of EBNA3C, amino acids 130 to 159 within the EBNA3 homology domain, as having the greatest affinity for cyclin A. The EBNA3 homology domain has the highest degree of amino acid similarity (approximately 30%) between the EBNA3 proteins, and, indeed, EBNA3B, but not EBNA3A, showed binding activity with cyclin A. We also show that EBNA3C binds to the alpha1 helix of the highly conserved mammalian cyclin box, with cyclin A amino acids 206 to 226 required for strong binding to EBNA3C amino acids 130 to 159. Interestingly, EBNA3C also bound human cyclins D1 and E in vitro, although the affinity was approximately 30% of that seen for cyclin A. Previously it was demonstrated that full-length EBNA3C rescues p27-mediated suppression of cyclin A-dependent kinase activity (J. S. Knight and E. S. Robertson, J. Virol. 78:1981-1991, 2004). It was also demonstrated that the carboxy terminus of EBNA3C recapitulates this phenotype. Surprisingly, the amino terminus of EBNA3C with the highest affinity for cyclin A was unable to rescue p27 suppression of kinase activity and actually downregulates cyclin A activity when introduced into EBV-infected cells. The data presented here suggests that the amino terminus of EBNA3C may play an important role in recruiting cyclin A complexes, while the carboxy terminus of EBNA3C is necessary for the functional modulation of cyclin A complex kinase activity.",
