        "Abstract": "Preterm birth results in low nephron endowment and increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). To understand the pathogenesis of AKI and CKD in preterm humans, we generated potentially novel mouse models with a 30%-70% reduction in nephron number by inhibiting or deleting Ret tyrosine kinase in the developing ureteric bud. These mice developed glomerular and tubular hypertrophy, followed by the transition to CKD, recapitulating the renal pathological changes seen in humans born preterm. We injected neonatal mice with gentamicin, a ubiquitous nephrotoxic exposure in preterm infants, and detected more severe proximal tubular injury in mice with low nephron number compared with controls with normal nephron number. Mice with low nephron number had reduced proliferative repair with more rapid development of CKD. Furthermore, mice had more profound inflammation with highly elevated levels of MCP-1 and CXCL10, produced in part by damaged proximal tubules. Our study directly links low nephron endowment with postnatal renal hypertrophy, which in this model is maladaptive and results in CKD. Underdeveloped kidneys are more susceptible to gentamicin-induced AKI, suggesting that AKI in the setting of low nephron number is more severe and further increases the risk of CKD in this vulnerable population.",

Severe forms of hyperoxaluria, including genetic forms and those that result from ethylene glycol poisoning, can result in end-stage renal disease. Therapeutic interventions are limited and often rely on dietary intervention. In this issue of the JCI, Le Dudal and colleagues demonstrate that the lactate dehydrogenase 5 inhibitor (LDH5) stiripentol reduces urinary oxalate excretion. Importantly, stiripentol treatment of a single individual with primary hyperoxaluria reduced the urinary oxalate excretion. Together, these results support further evaluation of LDH5 as a therapeutic target for hyperoxaluria.",

        "Abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if injury is severe and/or repair is incomplete. However, the pathogenesis of CKD following renal ischemic injury is not fully understood. Capillary rarefaction and tubular hypoxia are common findings during the AKI to CKD transition. We investigated the tubular stress response to hypoxia and demonstrated that a stress responsive transcription factor, FoxO3, was regulated by prolyl hydroxylase. Hypoxia inhibited FoxO3 prolyl hydroxylation and FoxO3 degradation, thus leading to FoxO3 accumulation and activation in tubular cells. Hypoxia-activated Hif-1\u03b1 contributed to FoxO3 activation and functioned to protect kidneys, as tubular deletion of Hif-1\u03b1 decreased hypoxia-induced FoxO3 activation, and resulted in more severe tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis following ischemic injury. Strikingly, tubular deletion of FoxO3 during the AKI to CKD transition aggravated renal structural and functional damage leading to a more profound CKD phenotype. We showed that tubular deletion of FoxO3 resulted in decreased autophagic response and increased oxidative injury, which may explain renal protection by FoxO3. Our study indicates that in the hypoxic kidney, stress responsive transcription factors can be activated for adaptions to counteract hypoxic insults, thus attenuating CKD development.",

        "Abstract": "To determine whether adult kidney papillary label-retaining cells (pLRCs) are specialized precursors, we analyzed their transcription profile. Among genes overexpressed in pLRCs, we selected candidate genes to perform qPCR and immunodetection of their encoded proteins. We found that Zfyve27, which encodes protrudin, identified a subpopulation of pLRCs. With Zfyve27-CreERT2 transgenic and reporter mice we generated bitransgenic animals and performed cell-lineage analysis. Post tamoxifen, Zfyve27-CreERT2 marked cells preferentially located in the upper part of the papilla. These cells were low cycling and did not generate progeny even after long-term observation, thus they did not appear to contribute to kidney homeostasis. However, after kidney injury, but only if severe, they activated a program of proliferation, migration, and morphogenesis generating multiple and long tubular segments. Remarkably these regenerated tubules were located preferentially in the kidney medulla, indicating that repair of injury in the kidney is regionally specified. These results suggest that different parts of the kidney have different progenitor cell pools.",

        "Title": "SDF1 induction by acidosis from principal cells regulates intercalated cell subtype distribution.",
        "Abstract": "The nephron cortical collecting duct (CCD) is composed of principal cells, which mediate Na, K, and water transport, and intercalated cells (ICs), which are specialized for acid-base transport. There are two canonical IC forms: acid-secreting \u03b1-ICs and HCO3-secreting \u03b2-ICs. Chronic acidosis increases \u03b1-ICs at the expense of \u03b2-ICs, thereby increasing net acid secretion by the CCD. We found by growth factor quantitative PCR array that acidosis increases expression of mRNA encoding SDF1 (or CXCL12) in kidney cortex and isolated CCDs from mouse and rabbit kidney cortex. Exogenous SDF1 or pH 6.8 media increased H+ secretion and decreased HCO3 secretion in isolated perfused rabbit CCDs. Acid-dependent changes in H+ and HCO3 secretion were largely blunted by AMD3100, which selectively blocks the SDF1 receptor CXCR4. In mice, diet-induced chronic acidosis increased \u03b1-ICs and decreased \u03b2-ICs. Additionally, IC-specific Cxcr4 deletion prevented IC subtype alterations and magnified metabolic acidosis. SDF1 was transcriptionally regulated and a target of the hypoxia-sensing transcription factor HIF1\u03b1. IC-specific deletion of Hif1a produced no effect on mice fed an acid diet, as \u03b1-ICs increased and \u03b2-ICs decreased similarly to that observed in WT littermates. However, Hif1a deletion in all CCD cells prevented acidosis-induced IC subtype distribution, resulting in more severe acidosis. Cultured principal cells exhibited an HIF1\u03b1-dependent increase of Sdf1 transcription in response to media acidification. Thus, our results indicate that principal cells respond to acid by producing SDF1, which then acts on adjacent ICs.",

        "Abstract": "The kidney, like other organs, grows in constant proportion to the rest of the body. When one kidney is removed, the remaining one hypertrophies. In a comprehensive series of studies, Chen et al. show that growth during maturation is mediated by the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is induced by EGF-like peptides, and requires PI3K, PDK, AKT, mTORC2, and activation of mTORC1 through the combined effects of TSC and RHEB as part of a multiprotein complex localized on lysosomes. However, compensatory growth is mediated by amino acids, which act on mTORC1 independently of the previous pathway, and requires a class III PI3K (VPS34) that is known to be involved in vesicle trafficking to the lysosomes.",

        "Title": "Developmental Programming of Branching Morphogenesis in the Kidney.",
        "Abstract": "The kidney developmental program encodes the intricate branching and organization of approximately 1 million functional units (nephrons). Branching regulation is poorly understood, as is the source of a 10-fold variation in nephron number. Notably, low nephron count increases the risk for developing hypertension and renal failure. To better understand the source of this variation, we analyzed the complete gestational trajectory of mouse kidney development. We constructed a computerized architectural map of the branching process throughout fetal life and found that organogenesis is composed of two distinct developmental phases, each with stage-specific rate and morphologic parameters. The early phase is characterized by a rapid acceleration in branching rate and by branching divisions that repeat with relatively reproducible morphology. The latter phase, however, is notable for a significantly decreased yet constant branching rate and the presence of nonstereotyped branching events that generate progressive variability in tree morphology until birth. Our map identifies and quantitates the contribution of four developmental mechanisms that guide organogenesis: growth, patterning, branching rate, and nephron induction. When applied to organs that developed under conditions of malnutrition or in the setting of growth factor mutation, our normative map provided an essential link between kidney architecture and the fundamental morphogenetic mechanisms that guide development. This morphogenetic map is expected to find widespread applications and help identify modifiable targets to prevent developmental programming of common diseases.",

Here, we have shown that A-ICs also serve as both sentinels and effectors in the defense against urinary infections. In a murine urinary tract infection model, A-ICs bound uropathogenic E. coli and responded by acidifying the urine and secreting the bacteriostatic protein lipocalin 2 (LCN2; also known as NGAL). A-IC-dependent LCN2 secretion required TLR4, as mice expressing an LPS-insensitive form of TLR4 expressed reduced levels of LCN2. The presence of LCN2 in urine was both necessary and sufficient to control the urinary tract infection through iron sequestration, even in the harsh condition of urine acidification. In mice lacking A-ICs, both urinary LCN2 and urinary acidification were reduced, and consequently bacterial clearance was limited. Together these results indicate that A-ICs, which are known to regulate acid-base metabolism, are also critical for urinary defense against pathogenic bacteria. They respond to both cystitis and pyelonephritis by delivering bacteriostatic chemical agents to the lower urinary system.",

        "Abstract": "Acidosis affects sodium and potassium excretion, likely via the pH sensitivity of ion transporters. A recent paper shows that \u03b2-intercalated cells with deleted H(+)-ATPase release ATP into urine, which induces the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 then reduces sodium absorption in the principal cells of the cortical collecting tubule and increases potassium secretion.",

        "Abstract": "The intercalated cell of the collecting tubule of the mammalian kidney is specialized for the transport of H(+) and HCO3. They exist in two forms; one specialized for acid secretion and the other secretes HCO3 into the urine. We discovered many years ago that feeding animals an acid diet converts the HCO3 secreting form to an acid secreting type. Here I discuss the molecular basis of this transformation. The conversion of the cell types is mediated by an extracellular matrix protein hensin (also known as DMBT1). However much remains to be identified in the differentiation of these cells.",

        "Title": "SDF-1 activates papillary label-retaining cells during kidney repair from injury.",
        "Abstract": "The adult kidney contains a population of low-cycling cells that resides in the papilla. These cells retain for long periods S-phase markers given as a short pulse early in life; i.e., they are label-retaining cells (LRC). In previous studies in adult rat and mice, we found that shortly after acute kidney injury many of the quiescent papillary LRC started proliferating (Oliver JA, Klinakis A, Cheema FH, Friedlander J, Sampogna RV, Martens TP, Liu C, Efstratiadis A, Al-Awqati Q. J Am Soc Nephrol 20: 2315-2327, 2009; Oliver JA, Maarouf O, Cheema FH, Martens TP, Al-Awqati Q. J Clin Invest 114: 795-804, 2004) and, with cell-tracking experiments, we found upward migration of some papillary cells including LRC (Oliver JA, Klinakis A, Cheema FH, Friedlander J, Sampogna RV, Martens TP, Liu C, Efstratiadis A, Al-Awqati Q. J Am Soc Nephrol 20: 2315-2327, 2009). To identify molecular cues involved in the activation (i.e., proliferation and/or migration) of the papillary LRC that follows injury, we isolated these cells from the H2B-GFP mice and found that they migrated and proliferated in response to the cytokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). Moreover, in a papillary organ culture assay, the cell growth out of the upper papilla was dependent on the interaction of SDF-1 with its receptor Cxcr4. Interestingly, location of these two proteins in the kidney revealed a complementary location, with SDF-1 being preferentially expressed in the medulla and Cxcr4 more abundant in the papilla. Blockade of Cxcr4 in vivo prevented mobilization of papillary LRC after transient kidney ischemic injury and worsened its functional consequences. The data indicate that the SDF-1/Cxcr4 axis is a critical regulator of papillary LRC activation following transient kidney injury and during organ repair.",

        "Title": "Deletion of hensin/DMBT1 blocks conversion of beta- to alpha-intercalated cells and induces distal renal tubular acidosis.",
        "Abstract": "Acid-base transport in the renal collecting tubule is mediated by two canonical cell types: the \u03b2-intercalated cell secretes HCO(3) by an apical Cl:HCO(3) named pendrin and a basolateral vacuolar (V)-ATPase. Acid secretion is mediated by the \u03b1-intercalated cell, which has an apical V-ATPase and a basolateral Cl:HCO(3) exchanger (kAE1). We previously suggested that the \u03b2-cell converts to the \u03b1-cell in response to acid feeding, a process that depended on the secretion and deposition of an extracellular matrix protein termed hensin (DMBT1). Here, we show that deletion of hensin from intercalated cells results in the absence of typical \u03b1-intercalated cells and the consequent development of complete distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA). Essentially all of the intercalated cells in the cortex of the mutant mice are canonical \u03b2-type cells, with apical pendrin and basolateral or diffuse/bipolar V-ATPase. In the medulla, however, a previously undescribed cell type has been uncovered, which resembles the cortical \u03b2-intercalated cell in ultrastructure, but does not express pendrin. Polymerization and deposition of hensin (in response to acidosis) requires the activation of \u03b21 integrin, and deletion of this gene from the intercalated cell caused a phenotype that was identical to the deletion of hensin itself, supporting its critical role in hensin function. Because previous studies suggested that the conversion of \u03b2- to \u03b1-intercalated cells is a manifestation of terminal differentiation, the present results demonstrate that this differentiation proceeds from HCO(3) secreting to acid secreting phenotypes, a process that requires deposition of hensin in the ECM.",

Following this differentiation step, the cells undergo a second step (terminal differentiation), during which they acquire a mature phenotype, which unlike the protoepithelial one is tissue and organ specific. An extracellular matrix (ECM) protein termed hensin (DMBT1) mediates this differentiation step in the kidney intercalated cells. Although hensin is secreted as a soluble monomer, it requires polymerization and deposition in the ECM to become active. The polymerization step is mediated by the activation of inside-out signaling by integrins and by the secretion of two proteins: cypA (a cis-trans prolyl isomerase) and galectin 3.",

        "Abstract": "The kidney papilla contains a population of cells with several characteristics of adult stem cells, including the retention of proliferation markers during long chase periods (i.e., they are label-retaining cells [LRCs]). To determine whether the papillary LRCs generate new cells in the normal adult kidney, we examined cell proliferation throughout the kidney and found that the upper papilla is a site of enhanced cell cycling. Using genetically modified mice that conditionally expressed green fluorescence protein fused to histone 2B, we observed that the LRCs of the papilla proliferated only in its upper part, where they associate with \"chains\" of cycling cells. The papillary LRCs decreased in number with age, suggesting that the cells migrated to the upper papilla before entering the cell cycle. To test this directly, we marked papillary cells with vital dyes in vivo and found that some cells in the kidney papilla, including LRCs, migrated toward other parts of the kidney. Acute kidney injury enhanced both cell migration and proliferation. These results suggest that during normal homeostasis, LRCs of the kidney papilla (or their immediate progeny) migrate to the upper papilla and form a compartment of rapidly proliferating cells, which may play a role in repair after ischemic injury.",

        "Abstract": "Hensin is a rabbit ortholog of DMBT1, a multifunctional, multidomain protein implicated in the regulation of epithelial differentiation, innate immunity, and tumorigenesis. Hensin in the extracellular matrix (ECM) induced morphological changes characteristic of terminal differentiation in a clonal cell line (clone C) of rabbit kidney intercalated cells. Although hensin is secreted in monomeric and various oligomeric forms, only the polymerized ECM form is able to induce these phenotypic changes. Here we report that hensin secretion and matrix assembly were inhibited by the peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and a derivative of cyclosporin A with modifications in the d-Ser side chain (Cs9) but not by the calcineurin pathway inhibitor FK506. PPIase inhibition led to failure of hensin polymerization in the medium and ECM, plus the loss of apical cytoskeleton, apical microvilli, and the columnar epithelial shape of clone C cells. Cyclophilin A was produced and secreted into the media to a much greater extent than cyclophilins B and C. Our results also identified the direct CsA-sensitive interaction of cyclophilin A with hensin, suggesting that cyclophilin A is the PPIase that mediates the polymerization and matrix assembly of hensin. These results are significant because this is the first time a direct role of peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase activity has been implicated in the process of epithelial differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "Cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) contains large amounts of proteoglycans made of a protein core decorated by highly sulfated sugar chains, the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs desulfation, a necessary step for their degradation, is exerted by sulfatases that are activated by another enzyme, Sulfatase-Modifying Factor 1 (SUMF1), whose inactivation in humans leads to severe skeletal abnormalities. We show here that despite being expressed in both osteoblasts and chondrocytes Sumf1 does not affect osteoblast differentiation. Conversely, in chondrocytes it favors ECM production and autophagy and promotes proliferation and differentiation by limiting FGF signaling. Thus, proteoglycan desulfation is a critical regulator of chondrogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Epithelial differentiation proceeds in at least two steps: Conversion of a nonepithelial cell into an epithelial sheet followed by terminal differentiation into the mature epithelial phenotype. It was recently discovered that the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein hensin is able to convert a renal intercalated cell line from a flat, squamous shape into a cuboidal or columnar epithelium. Global knockout of hensin in mice results in embryonic lethality at the time that the first columnar cells appear. Here, antibodies that either activate or block integrin beta1 were used to demonstrate that activation of integrin alpha v beta 1 causes deposition of hensin in the ECM. Once hensin polymerizes and deposits into the ECM, it binds to integrin alpha 6 and mediates the conversion of epithelial cells to a cuboidal phenotype capable of apical endocytosis; therefore, multiple integrins play a role in the terminal differentiation of the intercalated cell: alpha v beta 1 generates polymerized hensin, and another set of integrins (containing alpha 6) mediates signals between hensin and the interior of the cells.",

        "Abstract": "The intercalated cell of the cortical collecting tubule exists in two functional and morphologic forms: alpha cells secrete acid, while beta cells secrete HCO(3). It was found that beta cells convert to alpha type when the animal ingests an acid diet or when isolated perfused tubules are exposed to acid. This conversion of cell phenotype requires the induction of new genes, accompanied by a change in cell shape, development of microvilli, and apical endocytosis. All of these changes are reminiscent of terminal differentiation in epithelial cells. Using a beta intercalated cell line, the cause of this phenotypic change was identified as a new extracellular matrix protein, which was termed hensin. When the action of hensin is blocked, the conversion of beta to alpha intercalated cells is prevented and the animals develop distal renal tubular acidosis. Hensin is expressed in most epithelia, and global knockout of hensin results in embryonic lethality at the time of development of the first columnar epithelium, the visceral endoderm. Furthermore, hensin also seems to be involved in the differentiation of transitional and perhaps stratified epithelia as well. A large number of human carcinomas have deletions in the human ortholog of hensin (DMBT1). Collectively, these studies demonstrate that hensin is a mediator of terminal differentiation in many epithelia.",

        "Abstract": "Stem cells are characterized by low cycle time, which has allowed us to identify such cells in the mature kidney. These putative stem cells are located mostly outside the renal tubule and are concentrated in the papilla of the kidney potentially under the urinary epithelium of the papilla. Clonal analysis of these cells shows that they can differentiate into epithelial, neuronal, and other uncharacterized cells. Induction of ischemic renal failure resulted in increased proliferation of these papillary cells. Injection of these cells under the renal capsule led to their incorporation into various tubule segments. It is likely that these stem cells sense a \"damage\" signal from the cortex resulting in proliferation followed by migration to the site of injury.",

        "Abstract": "Epithelia, the most common variety of cells in complex organisms exist in many shapes. They are sheets of polarized cells that separate two compartments and selectively transport materials from one to the other. After acquiring these general characteristics, they differentiate to become specialized types such as squamous columnar or transitional epithelia. High density seeding converts a kidney-derived cell line from flat ;generic' epithelial cells to columnar cells. The cells acquire all the characteristics of differentiated columnar cells, including microvilli, and the capacity for apical endocytosis. The high seeding density induces the deposition of a new protein termed hensin and polymerization of hensin is the crucial event that dictates changes in epithelial phenotype. Hensin is widely expressed in most epithelia. Its deletion in mice leads to embryonic lethality at the time of generation of the first columnar epithelium, the visceral endoderm. Moreover many human cancers have deletions in the hensin gene, which indicates that it is a tumor suppressor.",

        "Title": "Galectin-3 expression is induced in renal beta-intercalated cells during metabolic acidosis.",
        "Abstract": "The adaptation of the cortical collecting duct (CCD) to metabolic acidosis requires the polymerization and deposition in the extracellular matrix of the novel protein hensin. HCO3(-)-secreting beta-intercalated cells remove apical Cl-:HCO3(-) exchangers and may reverse functional polarity to secrete protons. Using intercalated cells in culture, we found that galectin-3 facilitated hensin polymerization, thereby causing their differentiation into the H+-secreting cell phenotype. We examined the expression of galectin-3 in the rabbit kidney and its relationship to hensin during metabolic acidosis. In control kidneys, galectin-3 was expressed in the cortical and medullary collecting ducts. In the outer cortex 26 +/- 3% of CCD cells expressed galectin-3 compared with 64 +/- 3% of the cells of the inner cortex. In the CCD, galectin-3 was rarely expressed in beta-intercalated cells, being primarily present in alpha-intercalated and principal cells. During metabolic acidosis, the intensity of cellular staining for galectin-3 increased and more cells began to express it; the percentage of CCD cells expressing galectin-3 increased from 26 +/- 3 to 66 +/- 3% in the outer cortex and from 64 +/- 3 to 78 +/- 4% in the inner cortex. This was particularly evident in beta-intercalated cells where expression was found in only 8 +/- 2% in control animals but in 75 +/- 2% during metabolic acidosis in the outer cortex and similarly for the inner cortex (26 +/- 6 to 90 +/- 7%). Importantly, both galectin-3 and hensin were found in the extracellular matrix of microdissected CCDs; and during metabolic acidosis, many more cells exhibited this extracellular colocalization. Thus galectin-3 may play several important roles in the CCD, including mediating the adaptation of beta-intercalated cells during metabolic acidosis.",

        "Abstract": "The cortical collecting duct is able to secrete HCO3-, a state that can be converted to acid secretion during metabolic acidosis. Bicarbonate secretion in this segment is mediated by beta-intercalated cells whereas alpha-intercalated cells perform acid secretion. During metabolic acidosis, the number of beta-intercalated cells is reduced while that of alpha-intercalated cells increases without a change in the total number of intercalated cells, suggesting conversion of one cell type to another. Using an immortalized intercalated cell line we found that this adaptation is mediated by an extracellular protein named hensin. Hensin is secreted as a monomer which is then polymerized in the extracellular environment by a complex process requiring at least three other proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Notch signaling pathway genes are required for nephrogenesis, raising the possibility that Notch effector Hairy-related genes should also control nephron formation. We performed in situ hybridization of Hairy transcription factors with segment-specific lectins and/or antibodies during early nephrogenesis to identify their possible roles in segment identity of the nephron. We found that among all of Notch downstream Hairy genes, only Hes1, Hes5, Hey1, and HeyL were expressed in a segment-specific manner in early nephrons and their expression pattern changed dynamically during metanephric development. Based on these patterns of expression, it was possible to propose a pairwise association of specific ligand and receptor and to suggest that the effector of this association is one of the Hairy transcription factors. We found that Hes5 is specifically expressed in the anlage of the loop of Henle, suggesting that it might be involved in the determination of its cell identity. We also examined the morphological appearance of kidneys from mice where the Hes1 or Hes5 genes were deleted and found that at least at the gross morphological level, there was little difference from wild-type kidneys. Because Hairy genes associate with other transcription factors to exert their effect, it is necessary to examine a more complete array of genetic deletions before a conclusion can be reached regarding their role in kidney development. These studies provide the basis for the future development of strategies to examine the role of individual effector molecules in the determination of the differentiation pattern of the nephron.",

        "Abstract": "Single-layered epithelia are the first differentiated cell types to develop in the embryo, with columnar and squamous types appearing immediately after blastocyst implantation. Here, we show that mouse embryonic stem cells seeded on hensin or laminin, but not fibronectin or collagen type IV, formed hemispheric epithelial structures whose outermost layer terminally differentiated to an epithelium that resembled the visceral endoderm. Hensin induced columnar epithelia, whereas laminin formed squamous epithelia. At the egg cylinder stage, the distal visceral endoderm is columnar, and these cells begin to migrate anteriorly to create the anterior visceral endoderm, which assumes a squamous shape. Hensin expression coincided with the dynamic appearance and disappearance of columnar cells at the egg cylinder stage of the embryo. These expression patterns, and the fact that hensin null embryos (and those already reported for laminin) die at the onset of egg cylinder formation, support the view that hensin and laminin are required for terminal differentiation of columnar and squamous epithelial phenotypes during early embryogenesis.",

        "Title": "The renal papilla is a niche for adult kidney stem cells.",
        "Abstract": "Many adult organs contain stem cells, which are pluripotent and are involved in organ maintenance and repair after injury. In situ, these cells often have a low cycling rate and locate in specialized regions (niches). To detect such cells in the kidney, we administered a pulse of the nucleotide bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to rat and mouse pups and, after a long (more than 2-month) chase, examined whether the kidney contained a population of low-cycling cells. We found that in the adult kidney, BrdU-retaining cells were very sparse except in the renal papilla, where they were numerous. During the repair phase of transient renal ischemia, these cells entered the cell cycle and the BrdU signal quickly disappeared from the papilla, despite the absence of apoptosis in this part of the kidney. In vitro isolation of renal papillary cells showed them to have a plastic phenotype that could be modulated by oxygen tension and that when injected into the renal cortex, they incorporated into the renal parenchyma. In addition, like other stem cells, papillary cells spontaneously formed spheres. Single-cell clones of these cells coexpressed mesenchymal and epithelial proteins and gave rise to myofibroblasts, cells expressing neuronal markers, and cells of uncharacterized phenotype. These data indicate that the renal papilla is a niche for adult kidney stem cells.",

        "Title": "Cyclosporin A produces distal renal tubular acidosis by blocking peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of cyclophilin.",
        "Abstract": "Cyclosporin A (CsA), a widely used immunosuppressant, causes distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA). It exerts its immunosuppressive effect by a calcineurin-inhibitory complex with its cytosolic receptor, cyclophilin A. However, CsA also inhibits the peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity of cyclophilin A. We studied HCO(3)(-) transport and changes in beta-intercalated cell pH on luminal Cl(-) removal in isolated, perfused rabbit cortical collecting tubules (CCDs) before and after exposure to media pH 6.8 for 3 h. Acid incubation causes adaptive changes in beta-intercalated cells by extracellular deposition of hensin (J Clin Invest 109: 89, 2002). Here, CsA prevented this adaptation. The unidirectional HCO(3)(-) secretory flux, estimated as the difference between net flux and that after Cl(-) removal from the lumen, was -6.7 +/- 0.2 pmol.min(-1).mm(-1) and decreased to -1.3 +/- 0.2 after acid incubation. CsA in the bath prevented the adaptive decreases in HCO(3)(-) secretion and apical Cl(-):HCO(3)(-) exchange. To determine the mechanism, we incubated CCDs with FK-506, which inhibits calcineurin activity independently of the host cell cyclophilin. FK-506 did not prevent the acid-induced adaptive decrease in unidirectional HCO(3)(-) secretion. However, [AD-Ser](8) CsA, a CsA derivative, which does not inhibit calcineurin but inhibits PPIase activity of cyclophilin A, completely blocked the effect of acid incubation on apical Cl(-):HCO(3)(-) exchange. Acid incubation resulted in prominent \"clumpy\" staining of extracellular hensin and diminished apical surface of beta-intercalated cells [smaller peanut agglutinin (PNA) caps]. CsA and [AD-Ser](8) CsA prevented most hensin staining and the reduction of apical surface; PNA caps were more prominent. We suggest that hensin polymerization around adapting beta-intercalated cells requires the PPIase activity of cyclophilins. Thus CsA is able to prevent this adaptation by inhibition of a peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. Such inhibition may cause dRTA during acid loading.",

Forkhead box (Fox) genes are a large family of transcription factors that are important in cell-type specification during organogenesis. In this issue, Blomqvist et al. find that mice lacking Foxi1 have no intercalated cells in the kidney. The collecting ducts of the null mice contained primitive cells that expressed both intercalated cell and principal cell proteins, yet the acid/base transport function of the kidney was disrupted and the mice exhibited distal renal tubular acidosis. These findings suggest that Foxi1 plays a critical role in determining cell identity during collecting duct development.",

During their development, epithelia progress from this 'generic' phenotype to terminally differentiated states characterized by the development of apical structures such as microvilli, apical endocytosis and regulated exocytosis as well as characteristic cell shapes. We have identified an extracellular matrix protein, hensin, which when polymerized into a fiber induces the terminal differentiation of renal cells. Hensin is expressed in most epithelia where it exists in tissue-specific alternately spliced forms. Many epithelial tumors have deletions in the human ortholog of hensin. We propose that hensin mediates terminal differentiation of these epithelia.",

        "Abstract": "The intercalated cells of the collecting tubules of mammalian kidneys were discovered by Haggege and Richet to change their morphology in response to a variety of physiologic stimuli related to changes in acid base status. Recent studies showed that the conversion of beta to alpha intercalated cell under the influence of acidification of the medium is due to the deposition of hensin in the extracellular matrix of these cells and activation of a novel inductive signal transduction pathway. The conversion of beta to alpha cells is shown to be a process of terminal differentiation. Hensin is secreted as a monomer, and activation of the cell induces two activities that convert it to a dimer by folding and into a fiber by bundling of the folded dimers by galectin 3. Only the fiber is functional. Hensin is expressed in most epithelial cells, and its staining pattern suggests that it might be involved in the terminal differentiation of most epithelia. There is loss of heterozygosity of hensin in a large number of epithelial and neural tumors, making it likely that it is a tumor suppressor gene.",

        "Abstract": "Renal epithelial cells derive from either cells of the metanephric mesenchyme or ureteric bud cells, but the origin of other renal cells is unclear. To test whether metanephric mesenchymal cells generate cells other than epithelial, we examined the developmental potential of a metanephric mesenchymal cell line (7.1.1 cells) and of primary cultures of metanephric mesenchymal cells. 7.1.1 Cells express both mesenchymal and epithelial markers and, on confluence, form well-defined monolayers expressing epithelial junctional proteins. However, 7.1.1 cells as well as primary cultures of metanephric mesenchymal cells also generate spindle-shaped cells that are positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin, indicating that they are myofibroblasts and/or smooth muscle; this differentiation pathway is inhibited by collagen IV and enhanced by fetal calf serum or transforming growth factor-beta(1). Transforming growth factor-beta(1) also induces expression of smooth muscle proteins, indicating that the cells differentiate into smooth muscle. 7.1.1 Cells as well as primary cultures of metanephric mesenchymal cells also express vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and Tie-2, suggesting that the metanephric mesenchymal cells that generate epithelia may also differentiate into endothelial cells. The pluripotency of the 7.1.1 cells is self-renewing. The data suggest that the metanephric mesenchyme contains embryonic renal stem cells.",

        "Abstract": "During the response to metabolic acidosis, the intercalated cell of the collecting tubule converts from one that secretes HCO3(-) to one that absorbs HCO3(-) by H(+) secretion. The molecular basis of this complex change in phenotype was studied in an immortalized intercalated cell line. We found that it was induced by secretion, polymerization, and deposition of a protein, which we termed hensin, into the extracellular matrix. Surprisingly, this change in phenotype is identical to terminal differentiation of epithelial cells in that it recapitulated all the characteristics of terminal differentiation, including a change in cell shape, acquisition of specialized apical structures (microvilli and ruffles), and the ability to secrete and endocytose materials in a regulated manner from the apical membrane. Hensin is expressed in most epithelia, and others have discovered that it is deleted in a large number of epithelial tumors. These results suggest that conversion of polarity of the intercalated cells represents a process of terminal differentiation.",

        "Title": "Stem cells in the kidney.",
        "Abstract": "The kidney is derived from the ureteric bud and the metanephrogenic mesenchyme, and these two progenitor cells differentiate into more than 26 different cell types in the adult kidney. The ureteric bud contains the precursor of the epithelial cells of the collecting duct and the renal mesenchyme contains precursors of all the epithelia of the rest of the nephron, endothelial cell precursors and stroma cells, but the relatedness among these cells is unclear. A single metanephric mesenchymal cell can generate all the epithelial cells of the nephron (except the collecting duct), indicating that the kidney contains epithelial stem cells. It is currently unknown whether these stem cells also are present in the adult kidney but experience in other organs makes this likely. It also is unclear whether embryonic renal epithelial stem cells can generate other cell types, but preliminary studies in our laboratory suggest that they can differentiate into myofibroblasts, smooth muscle, and perhaps endothelial cells, indicating that they are pluripotent renal stem cells. The important problem to be solved now is the identification and location of adult renal stem cells. This article discusses work done in other organs and in renal development that we believe may be useful for the resolution of this problem.",

        "Title": "Acid incubation reverses the polarity of intercalated cell transporters, an effect mediated by hensin.",
        "Abstract": "Metabolic acidosis causes a reversal of polarity of HCO(3)(-) flux in the cortical collecting duct (CCD). In CCDs incubated in vitro in acid media, beta-intercalated (HCO(3)(-)-secreting) cells are remodeled to functionally resemble alpha-intercalated (H(+)-secreting) cells. A similar remodeling of beta-intercalated cells, in which the polarity of H(+) pumps and Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchangers is reversed, occurs in cell culture and requires the deposition of polymerized hensin in the ECM. CCDs maintained 3 h at low pH ex vivo display a reversal of HCO(3)(-) flux that is quantitatively similar to an effect previously observed in acid-treated rabbits in vivo. We followed intracellular pH in the same beta-intercalated cells before and after acid incubation and found that apical Cl/HCO(3) exchange was abolished following acid incubation. Some cells also developed basolateral Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange, indicating a reversal of intercalated cell polarity. This adaptation required intact microtubules and microfilaments, as well as new protein synthesis, and was associated with decreased size of the apical surface of beta-intercalated cells. Addition of anti-hensin antibodies prevented the acid-induced changes in apical and basolateral Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange observed in the same cells and the corresponding suppression of HCO(3)(-) secretion. Acid loading also promoted hensin deposition in the ECM underneath adapting beta-intercalated cells. Hence, the adaptive conversion of beta-intercalated cells to alpha-intercalated cells during acid incubation depends upon ECM-associated hensin.",
