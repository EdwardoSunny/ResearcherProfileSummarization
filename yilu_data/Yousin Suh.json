        "Title": "An eQTL-based approach reveals candidate regulators of LINE-1 RNA levels in lymphoblastoid cells.",
        "Abstract": "Long interspersed element 1 (LINE-1; L1) are a family of transposons that occupy ~17% of the human genome. Though a small number of L1 copies remain capable of autonomous transposition, the overwhelming majority of copies are degenerate and immobile. Nevertheless, both mobile and immobile L1s can exert pleiotropic effects (promoting genome instability, inflammation, or cellular senescence) on their hosts, and L1's contributions to aging and aging diseases is an area of active research. However, because of the cell type-specific nature of transposon control, the catalogue of L1 regulators remains incomplete. Here, we employ an eQTL approach leveraging transcriptomic and genomic data from the GEUVADIS and 1000Genomes projects to computationally identify new candidate regulators of L1 RNA levels in lymphoblastoid cell lines. To cement the role of candidate genes in L1 regulation, we experimentally modulate the levels of top candidates in vitro, including IL16, STARD5, HSD17B12, and RNF5, and assess changes in TE family expression by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Remarkably, we observe subtle but widespread upregulation of TE family expression following IL16 and STARD5 overexpression. Moreover, a short-term 24-hour exposure to recombinant human IL16 was sufficient to transiently induce subtle, but widespread, upregulation of L1 subfamilies. Finally, we find that many L1 expression-associated genetic variants are co-associated with aging traits across genome-wide association study databases. Our results expand the catalogue of genes implicated in L1 RNA control and further suggest that L1-derived RNA contributes to aging processes. Given the ever-increasing availability of paired genomic and transcriptomic data, we anticipate this new approach to be a starting point for more comprehensive computational scans for regulators of transposon RNA levels.",

        "Title": "SenNet recommendations for detecting senescent cells in different tissues.",
        "Abstract": "Once considered a tissue culture-specific phenomenon, cellular senescence has now been linked to various biological processes with both beneficial and detrimental roles in humans, rodents and other species. Much of our understanding of senescent cell biology still originates from tissue culture studies, where each cell in the culture is driven to an irreversible cell cycle arrest. By contrast, in tissues, these cells are relatively rare and difficult to characterize, and it is now established that fully differentiated, postmitotic cells can also acquire a senescence phenotype. The SenNet Biomarkers Working Group was formed to provide recommendations for the use of cellular senescence markers to identify and characterize senescent cells in tissues. Here, we provide recommendations for detecting senescent cells in different tissues based on a comprehensive analysis of existing literature reporting senescence markers in 14 tissues in mice and humans. We discuss some of the recent advances in detecting and characterizing cellular senescence, including molecular senescence signatures and morphological features, and the use of circulating markers. We aim for this work to be a valuable resource for both seasoned investigators in senescence-related studies and newcomers to the field.",

        "Abstract": "Several decades of heterochronic parabiosis (HCPB) studies have demonstrated the restorative impact of young blood, and deleterious influence of aged blood, on physiological function and homeostasis across tissues, although few of the factors responsible for these observations have been identified. Here we develop an in vitro HCPB system to identify these circulating factors, using replicative lifespan (RLS) of primary human fibroblasts as an endpoint of cellular health. We find that RLS is inversely correlated with serum donor age and sensitive to the presence or absence of specific serum components. Through in vitro HCPB, we identify the secreted protein pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) as a circulating factor that extends RLS of primary human fibroblasts and declines with age in mammals. Systemic administration of PEDF to aged mice reverses age-related functional decline and pathology across several tissues, improving cognitive function and reducing hepatic fibrosis and renal lipid accumulation. Together, our data supports PEDF as a systemic mediator of the effect of young blood on organismal health and homeostasis and establishes our in vitro HCPB system as a valuable screening platform for the identification of candidate circulating factors involved in aging and rejuvenation.",

        "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have uncovered over 75 genomic loci associated with risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), but identification of the underlying causal genes remains challenging. Studies of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from LOAD patients have demonstrated the existence of neuronal cell-intrinsic functional defects. Here, we searched for genetic contributions to neuronal dysfunction in LOAD using an integrative systems approach that incorporated multi-evidence-based gene mapping and network-analysis-based prioritization. A systematic perturbation screening of candidate risk genes in Caenorhabditis elegans (C.\u00a0elegans) revealed that neuronal knockdown of the LOAD risk gene orthologs vha-10 (ATP6V1G2), cmd-1 (CALM3), amph-1 (BIN1), ephx-1 (NGEF), and pho-5 (ACP2) alters short-/intermediate-term memory function, the cognitive domain affected earliest during LOAD progression. These results highlight the impact of LOAD risk genes on evolutionarily conserved memory function, as mediated through neuronal endosomal dysfunction, and identify new targets for further mechanistic interrogation.",

        "Abstract": "Muscle aging is a complex physiological process that leads to the progressive decline in muscle mass and function, contributing to debilitating conditions in the elderly such as sarcopenia. In recent years, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been increasingly recognized as major regulators of muscle aging and related cellular processes. Here, we comprehensively review the emerging role of ncRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), in the regulation of muscle aging. We also discuss how targeting these ncRNAs can be explored for the development of novel interventions to combat age-related muscle decline. The insights provided in this review offer a promising avenue for future research and therapeutic strategies aimed at improving muscle health during aging.",

Here, we report two 3C-derived methods, Tri-4C and Tri-HiC, which utilize multirestriction enzyme digestions for ultrafine mapping of targeted and genome-wide chromatin interaction, respectively, at up to one hundred basepair resolution. Tri-4C identified CRE loop interaction networks and quantitatively revealed their alterations underlying dynamic gene control. Tri-HiC uncovered global fine-gauge regulatory interaction networks, identifying >20-fold more enhancer:promoter (E:P) loops than in situ Hi-C. In addition to vastly improved identification of subkilobase-sized E:P loops, Tri-HiC also uncovered interaction stripes and contact domain insulation from promoters and enhancers, revealing their loop extrusion behaviors resembling the topologically associating domain boundaries. Tri-4C and Tri-HiC provide robust approaches to achieve the high-resolution interactome maps required for characterizing fine-gauge regulatory chromatin interactions in analysis of development, homeostasis, and disease.",

Aneuploidy refers to an abnormal chromosomal count, deviating from the normal diploid set. It can manifest as either a deficiency or excess of chromosomes. CIN encompasses a broader range of chromosomal alterations, including aneuploidy as well as structural modifications in DNA. We provide an overview of the state-of-the-art methodologies utilized for studying aneuploidy and CIN in non-tumor somatic tissues devoid of clonally expanded populations of aneuploid cells.CIN and aneuploidy, well-established hallmarks of cancer cells, are also associated with the aging process. In non-transformed cells, aneuploidy can contribute to functional impairment and developmental disorders. Despite the importance of understanding the prevalence and specific consequences of aneuploidy and CIN in the aging brain, these aspects remain incompletely understood, emphasizing the need for further scientific investigations.This comprehensive review consolidates the present understanding, addresses discrepancies in the literature, and provides valuable insights for future research efforts.",

A number of pleiotropic effects induced by L1 (promoting genome instability, inflammation, or cellular senescence) have been observed, and L1's contributions to aging and aging diseases is an area of active research. However, because of the cell type-specific nature of transposon control, the catalogue of L1 regulators remains incomplete. Here, we employ an eQTL approach leveraging transcriptomic and genomic data from the GEUVADIS and 1000Genomes projects to computationally identify new candidate regulators of L1 RNA levels in lymphoblastoid cell lines.

        "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have pinpointed the chromosomal locus 9p21.3 as a genetic hotspot for various age-related disorders. Common genetic variants in this locus are linked to multiple traits, including coronary artery diseases, cancers, and diabetes. Centenarians are known for their reduced risk and delayed onset of these conditions. To investigate whether this evasion of disease risks involves diminished genetic risks in the 9p21.3 locus, we sequenced this region in an Ashkenazi Jewish centenarian cohort (centenarians: n\u2009=\u2009450, healthy controls: n\u2009=\u2009500). Risk alleles associated with cancers, glaucoma, CAD, and T2D showed a significant depletion in centenarians. Furthermore, the risk and non-risk genotypes are linked to two distinct low-frequency variant profiles, enriched in controls and centenarians, respectively. Our findings provide evidence that the extreme longevity cohort is associated with collectively lower risks of multiple age-related diseases in the 9p21.3 locus.",

Preclinical studies have shown that rapamycin extends lifespan and healthspan metrics in yeast, invertebrates, and rodents. Several physicians are now prescribing rapamycin off-label as a preventative therapy to maintain healthspan. Thus far, however, there is limited data available on side effects or efficacy associated with use of rapamycin in this context. To begin to address this gap in knowledge, we collected data from 333 adults with a history of off-label use of rapamycin by survey. Similar data were also collected from 172 adults who had never used rapamycin. Here, we describe the general characteristics of a patient cohort using off-label rapamycin and present initial evidence that rapamycin can be used safely in adults of normal health status.",

        "Abstract": "Genomes are inherently unstable and require constant DNA repair to maintain their genetic information. However, selective pressure has optimized repair mechanisms in somatic cells only to allow transmitting genetic information to the next generation, not to maximize sequence integrity long beyond the reproductive age. Recent studies have confirmed that somatic mutations, due to errors during genome repair and replication, accumulate in tissues and organs of humans and model organisms. Here, we describe recent advances in the quantitative analysis of somatic mutations in vivo. We also review evidence for or against a possible causal role of somatic mutations in aging. Finally, we discuss options to prevent, delay or eliminate de novo, random somatic mutations as a cause of aging.",

        "Title": "Initial development and testing of an exhaled microRNA detection strategy for lung cancer case-control discrimination.",
        "Abstract": "For detecting field carcinogenesis non-invasively, early technical development and case-control testing of exhaled breath condensate microRNAs was performed. In design, human\u00a0lung tissue microRNA-seq discovery was reconciled with TCGA and published tumor-discriminant microRNAs, yielding a panel of 24 upregulated microRNAs. The airway origin of exhaled microRNAs was topographically \"fingerprinted\", using paired EBC, upper and lower\u00a0airway donor sample sets. A clinic-based case-control study (166 NSCLC cases, 185 controls) was interrogated with the microRNA panel by qualitative RT-PCR. Data were analyzed by logistic regression (LR), and by random-forest (RF) models. Feasibility testing\u00a0of exhaled microRNA detection, including optimized whole EBC extraction, and RT and qualitative PCR method evaluation, was performed. For sensitivity in this low template setting, intercalating dye-based URT-PCR was superior to fluorescent probe-based PCR (TaqMan). In application, adjusted logistic regression models identified exhaled miR-21, 33b, 212 as overall case-control discriminant. RF analysis of combined clinical\u2009+\u2009microRNA models showed modest added discrimination capacity (1.1-2.5%) beyond clinical models alone: all subjects 1.1% (p\u2009=\u20098.7e-04)); former smokers 2.5% (p\u2009=\u20093.6e-05); early stage 1.2% (p\u2009=\u20099.0e-03), yielding combined\u00a0ROC AUC ranging from 0.74 to 0.83. We conclude that exhaled\u00a0microRNAs are qualitatively measureable, reflect in part lower airway signatures; and when further refined/quantitated, can potentially help to improve lung cancer risk assessment.",

        "Abstract": "Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is a deacylase and mono-ADP ribosyl transferase (mADPr) enzyme involved in multiple cellular pathways implicated in aging and metabolism regulation. Targeted sequencing of SIRT6 locus in a population of 450 Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) centenarians and 550 AJ individuals without a family history of exceptional longevity identified enrichment of a SIRT6 allele containing two linked substitutions (N308K/A313S) in centenarians compared with AJ control individuals. Characterization of this SIRT6 allele (centSIRT6) demonstrated it to be a stronger suppressor of LINE1 retrotransposons, confer enhanced stimulation of DNA double-strand break repair, and more robustly kill cancer cells compared with wild-type SIRT6. Surprisingly, centSIRT6 displayed weaker deacetylase activity, but stronger mADPr activity, over a range of NAD",

        "Abstract": "Mice bred in 2017 and entered into the C2017 cohort were tested for possible lifespan benefits of (R/S)-1,3-butanediol (BD), captopril (Capt), leucine (Leu), the Nrf2-activating botanical mixture PB125, sulindac, syringaresinol, or the combination of rapamycin and acarbose started at 9 or 16\u2009months of age (RaAc9, RaAc16). In male mice, the combination of Rapa and Aca started at 9\u00a0months and led to a longer lifespan than in either of the two prior cohorts of mice treated with Rapa only, suggesting that this drug combination was more potent than either of its components used alone. In females, lifespan in mice receiving both drugs was neither higher nor lower than that seen previously in Rapa only, perhaps reflecting the limited survival benefits seen in prior cohorts of females receiving Aca alone. Capt led to a significant, though small (4% or 5%), increase in female lifespan. Capt also showed some possible benefits in male mice, but the interpretation was complicated by the unusually low survival of controls at one of the three test sites. BD seemed to produce a small (2%) increase in females, but only if the analysis included data from the site with unusually short-lived controls. None of the other 4 tested agents led to any lifespan benefit. The C2017 ITP dataset shows that combinations of anti-aging drugs may have effects that surpass the benefits produced by either drug used alone, and that additional studies of captopril, over a wider range of doses, are likely to be rewarding.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a well-known contributor to aging and age-related diseases. The precise mechanisms through which mitochondria impact human lifespan, however, remain unclear. We hypothesize that humans with exceptional longevity harbor rare variants in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes (mitonuclear genes) that confer resistance against age-related mitochondrial dysfunction. Here we report an integrated functional genomics study to identify rare functional variants in\u2009~\u2009660 mitonuclear candidate genes discovered by target capture sequencing analysis of 496 centenarians and 572 controls of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. We identify and prioritize longevity-associated variants, genes, and mitochondrial pathways that are enriched with rare variants. We provide functional gene variants such as those in MTOR (Y2396Lfs*29), CPS1 (T1406N), and MFN2 (G548*) as well as LRPPRC (S1378G) that is predicted to affect mitochondrial translation. Taken together, our results suggest a functional role for specific mitonuclear genes and pathways in human longevity.",

Despite clear sex differences in aging, the impact of pregnancy and its complications, such as preeclampsia, on aging is an underexplored area of geroscience. This review summarizes our current knowledge about the complex links between pregnancy and age-related diseases, including evidence from epidemiology, clinical research, and genetics. We discuss the relationship between normal and pathological pregnancy and maternal aging, using preeclampsia as a primary example. We review the results of human genetics studies of preeclampsia, including genome wide association studies (GWAS), and attempted to catalog genes involved in preeclampsia as a gateway to mechanisms underlying an increased risk of later life cardio- and neuro- vascular events. Lastly, we discuss challenges in interpreting the GWAS of preeclampsia and provide a functional genomics framework for future research needed to fully realize the promise of GWAS in identifying targets for geroprotective prevention and therapeutics against preeclampsia.",

        "Abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease, whereby immune cell-mediated killing leads to loss of the insulin-producing \u03b2 cells in the pancreas. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 200 genetic variants associated with risk for T1D. The majority of the GWAS risk variants reside in the non-coding regions of the genome, suggesting that gene regulatory changes substantially contribute to T1D. However, identification of causal regulatory variants associated with T1D risk and their affected genes is challenging due to incomplete knowledge of non-coding regulatory elements and the cellular states and processes in which they function. Here, we performed a comprehensive integrated post-GWAS analysis of T1D to identify functional regulatory variants in enhancers and their cognate target genes. Starting with 1,817 candidate T1D SNPs defined from the GWAS catalog and LDlink databases, we conducted functional annotation analysis using genomic data from various public databases. These include 1) Roadmap Epigenomics, ENCODE, and RegulomeDB for epigenome data; 2) GTEx for tissue-specific gene expression and expression quantitative trait loci data; and 3) lncRNASNP2 for long non-coding RNA data. Our results indicated a prevalent enhancer-based immune dysregulation in T1D pathogenesis. We identified 26 high-probability causal enhancer SNPs associated with T1D, and 64 predicted target genes. The majority of the target genes play major roles in antigen presentation and immune response and are regulated through complex transcriptional regulatory circuits, including those in HLA (6p21) and non-HLA (16p11.2) loci. These candidate causal enhancer SNPs are supported by strong evidence and warrant functional follow-up studies.",

        "Abstract": "Extreme longevity in humans has a strong genetic component, but whether this involves genetic variation in the same longevity pathways as found in model organisms is unclear. Using whole-exome sequences of a large cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians to examine enrichment for rare coding variants, we found most longevity-associated rare coding variants converge upon conserved insulin/insulin-like growth factor\u20091 signaling and AMP-activating protein kinase signaling pathways. Centenarians have a number of pathogenic rare coding variants similar to control individuals, suggesting that rare variants detected in the conserved longevity pathways are protective against age-related pathology. Indeed, we detected a pro-longevity effect of rare coding variants in the Wnt signaling pathway on individuals harboring the known common risk allele APOE4. The genetic component of extreme human longevity constitutes, at least in part, rare coding variants in pathways that protect against aging, including those that control longevity in model organisms.",

        "Abstract": "Gene variants associated with longevity are also associated with protection against cognitive decline, dementia and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that common physiologic pathways act at the interface of longevity and cognitive function. To test the hypothesis that variants in genes implicated in cognitive function may promote exceptional longevity, we performed a comprehensive 3-stage study to identify functional longevity-associated variants in ~700 candidate genes in up to 450 centenarians and 500 controls by target capture sequencing analysis. We found an enrichment of longevity-associated genes in the nPKC and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways by gene-based association analyses. Functional analysis of the top three gene variants (NFKBIA, CLU, PRKCH) suggests that non-coding variants modulate the expression of cognate genes, thereby reducing signaling through the nPKC and NF-\u03baB. This matches genetic studies in multiple model organisms, suggesting that the evolutionary conservation of reduced PKC and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways in exceptional longevity may include humans.",

        "Abstract": "The rich data from the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) offer an unprecedented opportunity to identify the biological underpinnings of age-related disease (ARD) risk and multimorbidity. Surprisingly, however, a comprehensive list of ARDs remains unavailable due to the lack of a clear definition and selection criteria. We developed a method to identify ARDs and to provide a compendium of ARDs for genetic association studies. Querying 1,358 electronic medical record-derived traits, we first defined ARDs and age-related traits (ARTs) based on their prevalence profiles, requiring a unimodal distribution that shows an increasing prevalence after the age of 40 years, and which reaches a maximum peak at 60 years of age or later. As a result, we identified a list of 463 ARDs and ARTs in the GWAS and PheWAS catalogs. We next translated the ARDs and ARTs to their respective 276 Medical Subject Headings diseases and 45 anatomy terms. The most abundant disease categories are neoplasms (48 terms), cardiovascular diseases (44 terms), and nervous system diseases (27 terms). Employing data from a human symptoms-disease network, we found 6 symptom-shared disease groups, representing cancers, heart diseases, brain diseases, joint diseases, eye diseases, and mixed diseases. Lastly, by overlaying our ARD and ART list with genetic correlation data from the UK Biobank, we found 54 phenotypes in 2 clusters with high genetic correlations. Our compendium of ARD and ART is a highly useful resource, with broad applicability for studies of the genetics of aging, ARD, and multimorbidity.",

        "Abstract": "To safely re-open economies and prevent future outbreaks, rapid, frequent, point-of-need, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing is necessary. However, existing field-deployable COVID-19 testing methods require the use of uncomfortable swabs and trained providers in PPE, while saliva-based methods must be transported to high complexity laboratories for testing. Here, we report the development and clinical validation of High-Performance Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (HP-LAMP), a rapid, saliva-based, SARS-CoV-2 test with a limit of detection of 1.4 copies of virus per \u00b5l of saliva and a sensitivity and specificity with clinical samples of\u2009>\u200996%, on par with traditional RT-PCR based methods using swabs, but can deliver results using only a single fluid transfer step and simple heat block. Testing of 120 patient samples in 40 pools comprised of 5 patient samples each with either all negative or a single positive patient sample was 100% accurate. Thus, HP-LAMP may enable rapid and accurate results in the field using saliva, without need of a high-complexity laboratory.",

        "Abstract": "The last few years have seen tremendous advances in CRISPR-mediated genome editing. Great efforts have been made to improve the efficiency, specificity, editing window, and targeting scope of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transgene knock-in and gene correction. In this article, we comprehensively review recent progress in CRISPR-based strategies for targeted transgene knock-in and gene correction in both homology-dependent and homology-independent approaches. We cover homology-directed repair (HDR), synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA), microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), and homology-mediated end joining (HMEJ) pathways for a homology-dependent strategy and alternative DNA repair pathways such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), base excision repair (BER), and mismatch repair (MMR) for a homology-independent strategy. We also discuss base editing and prime editing that enable direct conversion of nucleotides in genomic DNA without damaging the DNA or requiring donor DNA. Notably, we illustrate the key mechanisms and design principles for each strategy, providing design guidelines for multiplex, flexible, scarless gene insertion and replacement at high efficiency and specificity. In addition, we highlight next-generation base editors that provide higher editing efficiency, fewer undesired by-products, and broader targeting scope.",

        "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an urgent need for a rapid, point of care diagnostic testing that could be rapidly scaled on a worldwide level. We developed and tested a highly sensitive and robust assay based on reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) that uses readily available reagents and a simple heat block using contrived spike-in and actual clinical samples. RT-LAMP testing on RNA-spiked samples showed a limit of detection (LoD) of 2.5 copies/\u03bcl of viral transport media. RT-LAMP testing directly on clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples in viral transport media had an 85% positive percentage agreement (PPA) (17/20), and 100% negative percentage agreement (NPV) and delivered results in 30\u00a0min. Our optimized RT-LAMP based testing method is a scalable system that is sufficiently sensitive and robust to test for SARS-CoV-2 directly on clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples in viral transport media in 30\u00a0min at the point of care without the need for specialized or proprietary equipment or reagents. This cost-effective and efficient one-step testing method can be\u00a0readily available for COVID-19 testing world-wide, especially in resource poor settings.",

        "Abstract": "Ageing is the greatest risk factor for most common chronic human diseases, and it therefore is a logical target for developing interventions to prevent, mitigate or reverse multiple age-related morbidities. Over the past two decades, genetic and pharmacologic interventions targeting conserved pathways of growth and metabolism have consistently led to substantial extension of the lifespan and healthspan in model organisms as diverse as nematodes, flies and mice. Recent genetic analysis of long-lived individuals is revealing common and rare variants enriched in these same conserved pathways that significantly correlate with longevity. In this Perspective, we summarize recent insights into the genetics of extreme human longevity and propose the use of this rare phenotype to identify genetic variants as molecular targets for gaining insight into the physiology of healthy ageing and the development of new therapies to extend the human healthspan.",

Existing methods for nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) require an RNA extraction step prior to amplification of the viral RNA. This step necessitates the use of a centralized laboratory or complex and costly proprietary cartridges and equipment, and thereby prevents low-cost, scalable, point-of-care testing. We report the development of a highly sensitive and robust, easy-to-implement, SARS-CoV-2 test that utilizes isothermal amplification and can be run directly on viral transport media following a nasopharyngeal swab without the need for prior RNA extraction. Our assay provides visual results in 30 min with 85% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and a limit of detection (LoD) of 2.5 copies/\u03bcl, and can be run using a simple heat block.",

        "Abstract": "Many studies utilizing animal models have revealed the genetic and pharmacogenetic modulators of the rate of organismal aging. However, finding routes for healthy aging during extended life remains one of the largest questions. With regards to an antiaging reagent, it has been shown that natural phytochemical syringaresinol (SYR) delays cellular senescence by activating sirtuin1 (SIRT1). Here, it is found that SYR treatment results in metabolic changes similar to those observed during dietary restriction (DR). The DR mimetic effects are mediated by FoxO3a-dependent SIRT1 activation and insulin/insuline growth factor-1 signaling modulation. The direct binding of SYR-FoxO3a is identified and this could partially explain the DR-like phenotype. The report gives a clue as to how the longevity gene involves the DR pathway and suggests that natural phytochemicals applied as a geroprotector mimics DR effects.",

        "Abstract": "A key goal of aging research was to understand mechanisms underlying healthy aging and develop methods to promote the human healthspan. One approach is to identify gene regulations unique to healthy aging compared with aging in the general population (i.e., \"common\" aging). Here, we leveraged Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project data to investigate \"healthy\" and \"common\" aging gene expression regulations at a tissue level in humans and their interconnection with diseases. Using GTEx donors' disease annotations, we defined a \"healthy\" aging cohort for each tissue. We then compared the age-associated genes derived from this cohort with age-associated genes from the \"common\" aging cohort which included all GTEx donors; we also compared the \"healthy\" and \"common\" aging gene expressions with various disease-associated gene expressions to elucidate the relationships among \"healthy,\" \"common\" aging and disease. Our analyses showed that 1. GTEx \"healthy\" and \"common\" aging shared a large number of gene regulations; 2. Despite the substantial commonality, \"healthy\" and \"common\" aging genes also showed distinct function enrichment, and \"common\" aging genes had a higher enrichment for disease genes; 3. Disease-associated gene regulations were overall different from aging gene regulations. However, for genes regulated by both, their regulation directions were largely consistent, implying some aging processes could increase the susceptibility to disease development; and 4. Possible protective mechanisms were associated with some \"healthy\" aging gene regulations. In summary, our work highlights several unique features of GTEx \"healthy\" aging program. This new knowledge could potentially be used to develop interventions to promote the human healthspan.",

Currently, majority of the geroprotectors are found by screening compounds in model organisms; whether they will be effective in humans is largely unknown. Here we present a new strategy called ANDRU (aging network based drug discovery) to help the discovery of human geroprotectors. It first identifies human aging subnetworks that putatively function at the interface between aging and age-related diseases; it then screens for pharmacological interventions that may \"reverse\" the age-associated transcriptional changes occurred in these subnetworks. We applied ANDRU to human adipose gene expression data from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. For the top 31 identified compounds, 19 of them showed at least some evidence supporting their function in improving metabolic traits or lifespan, which include type 2 diabetes drugs such as pioglitazone. As the query aging genes were refined to the ones with more intimate links to diseases, ANDRU identified more meaningful drug hits than the general approach without considering the underlying network structures. In summary, ANDRU represents a promising human data-driven strategy that may speed up the discovery of interventions to extend human healthspan.",

        "Abstract": "Ageing is defined by the loss of functional reserve over time, leading to a decreased tissue homeostasis and increased age-related pathology. The accumulation of damage including DNA damage contributes to driving cell signaling pathways that, in turn, can drive different cell fates, including senescence and apoptosis, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. In addition, the accumulation of cell autonomous damage with time also drives ageing through non-cell autonomous pathways by modulation of signaling pathways. Interestingly, genetic and pharmacologic analysis of factors able to modulate lifespan and healthspan in model organisms and even humans have identified several key signaling pathways including IGF-1, NF-\u03baB, FOXO3, mTOR, Nrf-2 and sirtuins. This review will discuss the roles of several of these key signaling pathways, in particular NF-\u03baB and Nrf2, in modulating ageing and age-related diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial diseases represent a significant clinical challenge. Substantial efforts have been devoted to identifying therapeutic strategies for mitochondrial disorders, but effective interventions have remained elusive. Recently, we reported attenuation of disease in a mouse model of the human mitochondrial disease Leigh syndrome through pharmacological inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). The human mitochondrial disorder MELAS/MIDD (Mitochondrial Encephalopathy with Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like Episodes/Maternally Inherited Diabetes and Deafness) shares many phenotypic characteristics with Leigh syndrome. MELAS/MIDD often leads to organ failure and transplantation and there are currently no effective treatments. To examine the therapeutic potential of mTOR inhibition in human mitochondrial disease, four kidney transplant recipients with MELAS/MIDD were switched from calcineurin inhibitors to mTOR inhibitors for immunosuppression. Primary fibroblast lines were generated from patient dermal biopsies and the impact of rapamycin was studied using cell-based end points. Metabolomic profiles of the four patients were obtained before and after the switch. pS6, a measure of mTOR signaling, was significantly increased in MELAS/MIDD cells compared to controls in the absence of treatment, demonstrating mTOR overactivation. Rapamycin rescued multiple deficits in cultured cells including mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential, and replicative capacity. Clinical measures of health and mitochondrial disease progression were improved in all four patients following the switch to an mTOR inhibitor. Metabolomic analysis was consistent with mitochondrial function improvement in all patients.",

        "Abstract": "The rapid advancement of CRISPR technology has enabled targeted epigenome editing and transcriptional modulation in the native chromatin context. However, only a few studies have reported the successful editing of the epigenome in adult animals in contrast to the rapidly growing number of in vivo genome editing over the past few years. In this review, we discuss the challenges facing in vivo epigenome editing and new strategies to overcome the huddles. The biggest challenge has been the difficulty in packaging dCas9 fusion proteins required for manipulation of epigenome into the adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery vehicle. We review the strategies to address the AAV packaging issue, including small dCas9 orthologues, truncated dCas9 mutants, a split-dCas9 system, and potent truncated effector domains. We discuss the dCas9 conjugation strategies to recruit endogenous chromatin modifiers and remodelers to specific genomic loci, and recently developed methods to recruit multiple copies of the dCas9 fusion protein, or to simultaneous express multiple gRNAs for robust epigenome editing or synergistic transcriptional modulation. The use of Cre-inducible dCas9-expressing mice or a genetic cross between dCas9- and sgRNA-expressing flies has also helped overcome the transgene delivery issue. We provide perspective on how a combination use of these strategies can facilitate in vivo epigenome editing and transcriptional modulation.",

        "Abstract": "Skeletal muscle is one of the major organs responsible for body movements and metabolism making up approximately 40% of the total body mass. During aging, skeletal muscle exhibits a degenerative age-associated decline in mass and function termed sarcopenia. This age-associated dysfunction of skeletal muscle is a major criterion of morbidity, mortality, and overall declines of quality of life in the elderly people. Therefore, researchers have focused on identifying modulators of muscle aging process including messenger RNAs, proteins, and recently small noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs). In particular, miRNAs have been demonstrated to play a critical role in skeletal muscle development and homeostasis. Recent studies revealed that miRNAs were also involved in muscle aging processes and the rejuvenation of aged muscle by regulating important molecules and pathways of aging including insulin-like growth factors, nicotine-adenine dinucleotide (+)-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-1, telomerase reverse transcriptase, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 signaling pathway. Over the years, miRNAs have emerged as promising candidates for biomarkers of sarcopenia and targets for interventions to slow muscle aging. Here, we comprehensively review the current knowledge on the role of miRNAs in skeletal muscle aging and highlight their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for skeletal muscle health.",

        "Abstract": "Identification of all genetic variants associated with complex traits is one of the most important goals in modern human genetics. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successfully applied to identify common variants, which thus far explain only small portion of heritability. Interests in rare variants have been increasingly growing as an answer for this missing heritability. While next-generation sequencing allows detection of rare variants, its cost is still prohibitively high to sequence a large number of human DNA samples required for rare variant association studies. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of sequencing for pooled DNA samples of multiple individuals (Pool-seq) as a cost-effective and robust approach for rare variant discovery. We comparatively analyzed Pool-seq vs. individual-seq of indexed target capture of up to 960 genes in \u223c1000 individuals, followed by independent genotyping validation studies. We found that Pool-seq was as effective and accurate as individual-seq in detecting rare variants and accurately estimating their minor allele frequencies (MAFs). Our results suggest that Pool-seq can be used as an efficient and cost-effective method for discovery of rare variants for population-based sequencing studies in individual laboratories.",

        "Abstract": "Cerebral malaria (CM) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Risk for developing CM partially depends on host genetic factors, including variants encoded in the type I interferon (IFN) receptor 1 (IFNAR1). Type I IFNs bind to IFNAR1 resulting in increased expression of IFN responsive genes, which modulate innate and adaptive immune responses. To comprehensively study IFNAR1 genetic variant associations in Malawians with CM or uncomplicated malaria, we used a tag single nucleotide polymorphism approach, based on the HapMap Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria, population database. We identified three novel (rs914142, rs12626750, and rs1041867) and one previously published (Chr21:34696785 [C > G]) IFNAR1 variants to be associated with CM. Some of these variants are in gene regulatory regions. Chr21:34696785 (C > G) is in a region encoding histone modifications and transcription factor-binding sites, which suggests gene regulatory activity. Rs12626750 is predicted to bind embryonic lethal abnormal vision system-like RNA-binding protein 1, a RNA-binding protein which can increase the type I IFN response. Furthermore, we examined these variants in an expression quantitative trait loci database and found that a protective variant, rs914142, is associated with lower expression of IFNAR1, whereas the CM-associated variant rs12626750 was associated with increased IFNAR1 expression, suggesting that activation of the type I IFN pathway may contribute to pathogenesis of CM. Future functional studies of IFNAR1 variants are now needed to clarify the role of this pathway in severe malarial diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Gene regulatory analysis of highly diverse human tissues in vivo is essentially constrained by the challenge of performing genome-wide, integrated epigenetic and transcriptomic analysis in small selected groups of specific cell types. Here we performed genome-wide bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq from the same small groups of bronchial and alveolar cells isolated by laser capture microdissection from flash-frozen lung tissue of 12 donors and their peripheral blood T cells. Methylation and transcriptome patterns differed between alveolar and bronchial cells, while each of these epithelia showed more differences from mesodermally-derived T cells. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between alveolar and bronchial cells tended to locate at regulatory regions affecting promoters of 4,350 genes. A large number of pathways enriched for these DMRs including GTPase signal transduction, cell death, and skeletal muscle. Similar patterns of transcriptome differences were observed: 4,108 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched in GTPase signal transduction, inflammation, cilium assembly, and others. Prioritizing using DMR-DEG regulatory network, we highlighted genes, e.g., ETS1, PPARG, and RXRG, at prominent alveolar vs. bronchial cell discriminant nodes. Our results show that multi-omic analysis of small, highly specific cells is feasible and yields unique physiologic loci distinguishing human lung cell types in situ.",

Extensive genomic studies have revealed the important role of regulatory elements and genetic variation therein in disease formation and risk. In most cases, there is only correlative evidence for the roles of these elements and non-coding changes within these elements in pathogenesis. With the advent of genome- and epigenome-editing tools based on the CRISPR technology, it is now possible to test the functional relevance of the regulatory elements and alterations on a genomic scale. Here, we review the various CRISPR-based strategies that have been developed to functionally validate the candidate regulatory elements in mammals as well as the non-coding genetic variants found to be associated with human disease. We also discuss how these synthetic biology tools have helped to elucidate the role of three-dimensional nuclear architecture and higher-order chromatin organization in shaping functional genome and controlling gene expression.",

        "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have shown that the far majority of disease-associated variants reside in the non-coding regions of the genome, suggesting that gene regulatory changes contribute to disease risk. To identify truly causal non-coding variants and their affected target genes remains challenging but is a critical step to translate the genetic associations to molecular mechanisms and ultimately clinical applications. Here we review genomic/epigenomic resources and in silico tools that can be used to identify causal non-coding variants and experimental strategies to validate their functionalities. Impact statement Most signals from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) map to the non-coding genome, and functional interpretation of these associations remained challenging. We reviewed recent progress in methodologies of studying the non-coding genome and argued that no single approach allows one to effectively identify the causal regulatory variants from GWAS results. By illustrating the advantages and limitations of each method, our review potentially provided a guideline for taking a combinatorial approach to accurately predict, prioritize, and eventually experimentally validate the causal variants.",

Here, we present data on somatic mutation rates in mice and humans, obtained by sequencing single cells and clones derived from primary fibroblasts, which allows us to make the first direct comparison with germline mutation rates in these two species. The results indicate that the somatic mutation rate is almost two orders of magnitude higher than the germline mutation rate and that both mutation rates are significantly higher in mice than in humans. Our findings demonstrate both the privileged status of germline genome integrity and species-specific differences in genome maintenance.",

        "Abstract": "Age-associated loss of muscle mass and function is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly adults. Muscular atrophy can also be induced by disuse associated with long-term bed rest or disease. Although miRNAs regulate muscle growth, regeneration, and aging, their potential role in acute muscle atrophy is poorly understood. Furthermore, alterations in circulating miRNA levels have been shown to occur during aging but their potential as noninvasive biomarkers for muscle atrophy remains largely unexplored. Here, we report comprehensive miRNA expression profiles by miRNA-seq analysis in tibialis anterior muscle and serum of a disuse-induced atrophy mouse model, mimicking the acute atrophy following long-term bed rest, as compared to those of young and old mice. Comparative analysis and validation studies have revealed that miR-455-3p was significantly decreased in muscle of both induced-atrophy model and old mice, whereas miR-434-3p was decreased in both serum and muscle of old mice, as compared to young mice. Furthermore, upregulation of miR-455-3p in fully differentiated C2C12 myoblasts induced a hypertrophic phenotype. These results suggest that deregulation of miR-455-3p may play a functional role in muscle atrophy and miR-434-3p could be a candidate serum biomarker of muscle aging.",

        "Abstract": "In the 1960s, Leslie Orgel proposed what is now known as the error catastrophe theory of aging, arguing that errors in protein translation that reduce the fidelity of the protein-translating enzymes would lead to a feedback loop of increasingly inaccurate protein synthesis, terminating in the death of the organism. This mechanism of aging would be consistent with the exponential increase of mortality observed in humans, but the error catastrophe theory of aging has been generally disregarded by researchers due to a lack of evidence for an age-related increase in protein errors. Another theory of aging, proposed at roughly the same time, is Leo Szilard's two-hit model of somatic mutation accumulation, which assumed a linear increase in mutations over time but explained the nonlinear pattern of human mortality through a mechanism of genetic and cellular redundancy which kept mortality low until the redundancy was exhausted, at which point mortality rapidly rose. Here, we synthesize the two theories, along with the latest advances in genomics research. We propose a new catastrophe theory of aging, this time with somatic mutations as the primary agent of the feedback loop. Similar to protein errors affecting translation itself, somatic mutations in genes involved in DNA replication and repair would lead to a feedback loop of exponentially increasing mutation load. The difference from protein errors is that somatic mutations would mainly affect gene regulatory regions rather than the much smaller part of the genome encoding protein-coding information. Although the self-stimulating accumulation of somatic mutations is not mutually exclusive with the Szilard-based loss of redundancy, we present evidence that suggests that the accumulated mutations themselves could be numerous enough to cause mortality. Finally, we acknowledge the limits of our current knowledge and propose a course of research practices that will help to confirm or refute our model and advance the field of aging research as a whole.",

        "Abstract": "Human aging is a lifelong process characterized by a continuous trade-off between pro-and anti-inflammatory responses, where the best-adapted and/or remodeled genetic/epigenetic profile may develop a longevity phenotype. Centenarians and their offspring represent such a phenotype and their comparison to patients with age-related diseases (ARDs) is expected to maximize the chance to unravel the genetic makeup that better associates with healthy aging trajectories. Seemingly, such comparison is expected to allow the discovery of new biomarkers of longevity together with risk factor for the most common ARDs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and their shuttles (extracellular vesicles in particular) are currently conceived as those endowed with the strongest ability to provide information about the trajectories of healthy and unhealthy aging. We review the available data on miRNAs in aging and underpin the evidence suggesting that circulating miRNAs (and cognate shuttles), especially those involved in the regulation of inflammation (inflamma-miRs) may constitute biomarkers capable of reliably depicting healthy and unhealthy aging trajectories.",

        "Abstract": "The recent advent of genome and epigenome editing technologies has provided a new paradigm in which the landscape of the human genome and epigenome can be precisely manipulated in their native context. Genome and epigenome editing technologies can be applied to many aspects of aging research and offer the potential to develop novel therapeutics against age-related diseases. Here, we discuss the latest technological advances in the CRISPR-based genome and epigenome editing toolbox, and provide insight into how these synthetic biology tools could facilitate aging research by establishing in vitro cell and in vivo animal models to dissect genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying aging and age-related diseases. We discuss recent developments in the field with the aims to precisely modulate gene expression and dynamic epigenetic landscapes in a spatial and temporal manner in cellular and animal models, by complementing the CRISPR-based editing capability with conditional genetic manipulation tools including chemically inducible expression systems, optogenetics, logic gate genetic circuits, tissue-specific promoters, and the serotype-specific adeno-associated virus. We also discuss how the combined use of genome and epigenome editing tools permits investigators to uncover novel molecular pathways involved in the pathophysiology and etiology conferred by risk variants associated with aging and aging-related disease. A better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying human aging and age-related disease will significantly contribute to the developments of new therapeutic interventions for extending health span and life span, ultimately improving the quality of life in the elderly populations.",

        "Title": "Network analysis of mitonuclear GWAS reveals functional networks and tissue expression profiles of disease-associated genes.",
        "Abstract": "While mitochondria have been linked to many human diseases through genetic association and functional studies, the precise role of mitochondria in specific pathologies, such as cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and metabolic diseases, is often unclear. Here, we take advantage of the catalog of human genome-wide associations, whole-genome tissue expression and expression quantitative trait loci datasets, and annotated mitochondrial proteome databases to examine the role of common genetic variation in mitonuclear genes in human disease. Through pathway-based analysis we identified distinct functional pathways and tissue expression profiles associated with each of the major human diseases. Among our most striking findings, we observe that mitonuclear genes associated with cancer are broadly expressed among human tissues and largely represent one functional process, intrinsic apoptosis, while mitonuclear genes associated with other diseases, such as neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, show tissue-specific expression profiles and are associated with unique functional pathways. These results provide new insight into human diseases using unbiased genome-wide approaches.",

        "Title": "Genomewide meta-analysis identifies loci associated with IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels with impact on age-related traits.",
        "Abstract": "The growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis can be manipulated in animal models to promote longevity, and IGF-related proteins including IGF-I and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) have also been implicated in risk of human diseases including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Through genomewide association study of up to 30\u00a0884 adults of European ancestry from 21 studies, we confirmed and extended the list of previously identified loci associated with circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations (IGF1, IGFBP3, GCKR, TNS3, GHSR, FOXO3, ASXL2, NUBP2/IGFALS, SORCS2, and CELSR2). Significant sex interactions, which were characterized by different genotype-phenotype associations between men and women, were found only for associations of IGFBP-3 concentrations with SNPs at the loci IGFBP3 and SORCS2. Analyses of SNPs, gene expression, and protein levels suggested that interplay between IGFBP3 and genes within the NUBP2 locus (IGFALS and HAGH) may affect circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations. The IGF-I-decreasing allele of SNP rs934073, which is an eQTL of ASXL2, was associated with lower adiposity and higher likelihood of survival beyond 90\u00a0years. The known longevity-associated variant rs2153960 (FOXO3) was observed to be a genomewide significant SNP for IGF-I concentrations. Bioinformatics analysis suggested enrichment of putative regulatory elements among these IGF-I- and IGFBP-3-associated loci, particularly of rs646776 at CELSR2. In conclusion, this study identified several loci associated with circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations and provides clues to the potential role of the IGF axis in mediating effects of known (FOXO3) and novel (ASXL2) longevity-associated loci.",

Two common APOE alleles are either significantly depleted (\u03b54 allele) or enriched (\u03b52 allele) in long-lived individuals as compared to controls. We performed high-throughput sequencing analysis of exons and 2kb proximal promoter of APOE in 450 centenarians and 500 controls of Ashkenazi Jewish decent. We found two common regulatory variants, rs405509 (p=0.006) and rs769449 (p=0.036), that were significantly depleted in centenarians. Genotyping analysis of rs7412 and rs429358 showed significant enrichment of \u03b52 allele (p=0.003) and \u03b52/\u03b53 genotype (p=0.005), and significant depletion of \u03b53/\u03b54 genotype (p=0.005) in centenarians. Our findings support the hypothesis that variants in both coding and regulatory regions of APOE may contribute to longevity in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Many genes that affect replicative lifespan (RLS) in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae also affect aging in other organisms such as C.\u00a0elegans and M.\u00a0musculus. We performed a systematic analysis of yeast RLS in a set of 4,698 viable single-gene deletion strains. Multiple functional gene clusters were identified, and full genome-to-genome comparison demonstrated a significant conservation in longevity pathways between yeast and C.\u00a0elegans. Among the mechanisms of aging identified, deletion of tRNA exporter LOS1 robustly extended lifespan. Dietary restriction (DR) and inhibition of mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) exclude Los1 from the nucleus in a Rad53-dependent manner. Moreover, lifespan extension from deletion of LOS1 is nonadditive with DR or mTOR inhibition, and results in Gcn4 transcription factor activation. Thus, the DNA damage response and mTOR converge on Los1-mediated nuclear tRNA export to regulate Gcn4 activity and aging.",

        "Abstract": "Aging is associated with an increased risk of cancer, possibly in part because of an age-related increase in mutations in normal tissues. Due to their extremely low abundance, somatic mutations in normal tissues frequently escape detection. Tumors, as clonal expansions of single cells, can provide information about the somatic mutations present in these cells prior to tumorigenesis. Here, we used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), to systematically study the frequency and spectrum of somatic mutations in a total of 6,969 patients and 34 different tumor types as a function of the age of the patient. After using linear modeling to control for the age structure of different tumor types, we found that the number of identified somatic mutations increases exponentially with age. Using additional data from the literature, we found that accumulation of somatic mutations is associated with cell division rate, cancer risk and cigarette smoking, with the latter also associated with a distinct spectrum of mutations. Our results confirm that aging is associated with the accumulation of somatic mutations, and strongly suggest that the level of genome instability of normal cells, modified by both endogenous and environmental factors, is the main risk factor for cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Rapamycin extends lifespan and attenuates age-related pathologies in mice when administered through diet at 14 parts per million (PPM). Recently, we reported that daily intraperitoneal injection of rapamycin at 8 mg/kg attenuates mitochondrial disease symptoms and progression in the Ndufs4 knockout mouse model of Leigh Syndrome. Although rapamycin is a widely used pharmaceutical agent dosage has not been rigorously examined and no dose-response profile has been established. Given these observations we sought to determine if increased doses of oral rapamycin would result in more robust impact on mTOR driven parameters. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of dietary rapamycin at doses ranging from 14 to 378 PPM on developmental weight in control and Ndufs4 knockout mice and on health and survival in the Ndufs4 knockout model. High dose rapamycin was well tolerated, dramatically reduced weight gain during development, and overcame gender differences. The highest oral dose, approximately 27-times the dose shown to extend murine lifespan, increased survival in Ndufs4 knockout mice similarly to daily rapamycin injection without observable adverse effects. These findings have broad implications for the effective use of rapamycin in murine studies and for the translational potential of rapamycin in the treatment of mitochondrial disease. This data, further supported by a comparison of available literature, suggests that 14 PPM dietary rapamycin is a sub-optimal dose for targeting mTOR systemically in mice. Our findings suggest that the role of mTOR in mammalian biology may be broadly underestimated when determined through treatment with rapamycin at commonly used doses.",

        "Title": "An epigenomic role of Fe65 in the cellular response to DNA damage.",
        "Abstract": "Previous findings describe Fe65 as a key protein in the cellular response to genotoxic stress. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which Fe65 contributes to DNA damage signaling remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that the transcriptional activity of Fe65 may contribute to DNA damage pathways by regulating gene expression patterns activated in response to genotoxic stress. To address this hypothesis, we mapped the global binding profile of Fe65 by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing in the SK-N-SH cells exposed to genotoxic stress. Unexpectedly, the genome-wide location analysis showed a substantial enrichment of Fe65 in the promoter regions of coding genes linked to DNA damage signaling pathways. To further investigate the role of Fe65 in the transcriptional regulation of putative coding target genes identified by ChIP-seq, we performed microarray assays using wild-type (WT) or Fe65 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exposed to oxidative stress with multiple recovery times. Gene ontology analysis of the Fe65-depedent transcriptome suggested that Fe65 modulates the expression of genes critical for DNA damage response. Motif enrichment analysis of regulatory regions occupied by Fe65 revealed a strong correlation with key transcription factors involved in DNA damage signaling pathways, including E2F1, p53, and Jun. Comparison of ChIP-sequencing results with microarray results ultimately identified 248 Fe65-depedent target genes, the majority of which were known regulators of cell cycle, cell death, and DNA replication and repair pathways. We validated the target genes identified by in silico analysis by qPCR experiments. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence that Fe65 plays a role in DNA damage response and cell viability by epigenomic regulation of specific transcriptional programs activated upon genotoxic stress.",

Selective genetic ablation of LSD1n led to deficits in spatial learning and memory, revealing the functional importance of LSD1n in neuronal activity-regulated transcription that is necessary for long-term memory formation. LSD1n occupied neuronal gene enhancers, promoters and transcribed coding regions, and was required for transcription initiation and elongation steps in response to neuronal activity, indicating the crucial role of H4K20 methylation in coordinating gene transcription with neuronal function. Our results indicate that this alternative splicing of LSD1 in neurons, which was associated with altered substrate specificity, serves as a mechanism acquired by neurons to achieve more precise control of gene expression in the complex processes underlying learning and memory.",

        "Abstract": "Aging is the single largest risk factor for chronic disease. Studies in model organisms have identified conserved pathways that modulate aging rate and the onset and progression of multiple age-related diseases, suggesting that common pathways of aging may influence age-related diseases in humans as well. To determine whether there is genetic evidence supporting the notion of common pathways underlying age-related diseases, we analyzed the genes and pathways found to be associated with five major categories of age-related disease using a total of 410 genomewide association studies (GWAS). While only a small number of genes are shared among all five disease categories, those found in at least three of the five major age-related disease categories are highly enriched for apoliprotein metabolism genes. We found that a more substantial number of gene ontology (GO) terms are shared among the 5 age-related disease categories and shared GO terms include canonical aging pathways identified in model organisms, such as nutrient-sensing signaling, translation, proteostasis, stress responses, and genome maintenance. Taking advantage of the vast amount of genetic data from the GWAS, our findings provide the first direct evidence that conserved pathways of aging simultaneously influence multiple age-related diseases in humans as has been demonstrated in model organisms.",

        "Title": "MicroRNA transcriptome analysis identifies miR-365 as a novel negative regulator of cell proliferation in Zmpste24-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts.",
        "Abstract": "Zmpste24 is a metalloproteinase responsible for the posttranslational processing and cleavage of prelamin A into mature laminA. Zmpste24(-/-) mice display a range of progeroid phenotypes overlapping with mice expressing progerin, an altered version of lamin A associated with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Increasing evidence has demonstrated that miRNAs contribute to the regulation of normal aging process, but their roles in progeroid disorders remain poorly understood. Here we report the miRNA transcriptomes of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) established from wild type (WT) and Zmpste24(-/-) progeroid mice using a massively parallel sequencing technology. With data from 19.5 \u00d7 10(6) reads from WT MEFs and 16.5 \u00d7 10(6) reads from Zmpste24(-/-) MEFs, we discovered a total of 306 known miRNAs expressed in MEFs with a wide dynamic range of read counts ranging from 10 to over 1 million. A total of 8 miRNAs were found to be significantly down-regulated, with only 2 miRNAs upregulated, in Zmpste24(-/-) MEFs as compared to WT MEFs. Functional studies revealed that miR-365, a significantly down-regulated miRNA in Zmpste24(-/-) MEFs, modulates cellular growth phenotypes in MEFs. Overexpression of miR-365 in Zmpste24(-/-) MEFs increased cellular proliferation and decreased the percentage of SA-\u03b2-gal-positive cells, while inhibition of miR-365 function led to an increase of SA-\u03b2-gal-positive cells in WT MEFs. Furthermore, we identified Rasd1, a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, as a functional target of miR-365. While expression of miR-365 suppressed Rasd1 3' UTR luciferase-reporter activity, this effect was lost with mutations in the putative 3' UTR target-site. Consistently, expression levels of miR-365 were found to inversely correlate with endogenous Rasd1 levels. These findings suggest that miR-365 is down-regulated in Zmpste24(-/-) MEFs and acts as a novel negative regulator of Rasd1. Our comprehensive miRNA data provide a resource to study gene regulatory networks in MEFs.",

        "Abstract": "Pmt1p is an important member of the protein O-mannosyltransferase (PMT) family of enzymes, which participates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPR), an important pathway for alleviating ER stress. ER stress and the UPR have been implicated in aging and age-related diseases in several organisms; however, a possible role for PMT1 in determining lifespan has not been previously described. In this study, we report that deletion of PMT1 increases replicative lifespan (RLS) in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, while overexpression of PMT1 (PMT1-OX) reduces RLS. Relative to wild-type and PMT1-OX strains, the pmt1\u0394 strain had enhanced HAC1 mRNA splicing and elevated expression levels of UPR target genes. Furthermore, the increased RLS of the pmt1\u0394 strain could be completely abolished by deletion of either IRE1 or HAC1, two upstream modulators of the UPR. The double deletion strains pmt1\u0394hac1\u0394 and pmt1\u0394ire1\u0394 also displayed generally reduced transcription of UPR target genes. Collectively, our results suggest that PMT1 deficiency enhances basal activity of the ER UPR and extends the RLS of yeast mother cells through a mechanism that requires both IRE1 and HAC1.",

        "Abstract": "The workshop entitled 'Interventions to Slow Aging in Humans: Are We Ready?' was held in Erice, Italy, on October 8-13, 2013, to bring together leading experts in the biology and genetics of aging and obtain a consensus related to the discovery and development of safe interventions to slow aging and increase healthy lifespan in humans. There was consensus that there is sufficient evidence that aging interventions will delay and prevent disease onset for many chronic conditions of adult and old age. Essential pathways have been identified, and behavioral, dietary, and pharmacologic approaches have emerged. Although many gene targets and drugs were discussed and there was not complete consensus about all interventions, the participants selected a subset of the most promising strategies that could be tested in humans for their effects on healthspan. These were: (i) dietary interventions mimicking chronic dietary restriction (periodic fasting mimicking diets, protein restriction, etc.); (ii) drugs that inhibit the growth hormone/IGF-I axis; (iii) drugs that inhibit the mTOR-S6K pathway; or (iv) drugs that activate AMPK or specific sirtuins. These choices were based in part on consistent evidence for the pro-longevity effects and ability of these interventions to prevent or delay multiple age-related diseases and improve healthspan in simple model organisms and rodents and their potential to be safe and effective in extending human healthspan. The authors of this manuscript were speakers and discussants invited to the workshop. The following summary highlights the major points addressed and the conclusions of the meeting.",

        "Abstract": "Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is activated in response to cellular stressors to prevent cellular proteotoxicity through selective degradation of altered proteins in lysosomes. Reduced CMA activity contributes to the decrease in proteome quality in disease and ageing. Here, we report that CMA is also upregulated in response to genotoxic insults and that declined CMA functionality leads to reduced cell survival and genomic instability. This role of CMA in genome quality control is exerted through regulated degradation of activated checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) by this pathway after the genotoxic insult. Nuclear accumulation of Chk1 in CMA-deficient cells compromises cell cycle progression and prolongs the time that DNA damage persists in these cells. Furthermore, blockage of CMA leads to hyperphosphorylation and destabilization of the MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) complex, which participates in early steps of particular DNA repair pathways. We propose that CMA contributes to maintain genome stability by assuring nuclear proteostasis.",

        "Abstract": "There is a need to develop a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening test that is noninvasive, cost effective, and sensitive enough to detect preneoplastic lesions. This case-control study examined the feasibility of using circulating extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) to differentiate a spectrum of colorectal neoplasia of various severity and hence for early detection of colorectal neoplasia. Archived serum samples of 10 normal controls and 31 cases, including 10 with nonadvanced adenoma, 10 with advanced adenoma, and 11 with CRC, were profiled for circulating miRNAs using next-generation sequencing. Multiple linear regression, adjusting for age, gender, and smoking status, compared controls and the 3 case groups for levels of 175 miRNAs that met stringent criteria for miRNA sequencing analysis. Of the 175 miRNAs, 106 miRNAs were downregulated according to severity of neoplasia and showed a relative decrease in the expression from controls to nonadvanced adenoma to advanced adenoma to CRC (Ptrend\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Pairwise group comparisons showed that 39 and 80 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the advanced adenoma and CRC groups compared with the controls, respectively. Differences in miRNA levels between the nonadvanced adenoma group and controls were modest. Our study found that expression of many miRNAs in serum was inversely correlated with the severity of colorectal neoplasia, and differential miRNA profiles were apparent in preneoplastic cases with advanced lesions, suggesting circulating miRNAs could serve as potential biomarkers for CRC screening.",

        "Abstract": "SIRT1 exerts protective effects against endothelial cells dysfunction, inflammation and atherosclerosis, indicating an important role on myocardial infarction (MI) pathogenesis. Nonetheless, the effects of SIRT1 variants on MI risk remain poorly understood. Here we aimed to investigate the influence of SIRT1 polymorphisms on individual susceptibility to MI. Genotyping of three tagSNPs (rs7069102, rs3818292 and rs4746720) in SIRT1 gene was performed in a Chinese Han population, consisting of 287 MI cases and 654 control subjects. In a logistic regression analysis, we found that G allele of rs7069102 had increased MI risk with odds ratio (OR) of 1.57 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.15-2.16, Bonferroni corrected P (Pc) = 0.015] after adjustment for conventional risk factors compared to C allele. Similarly, the combined CG/GG genotypes was associated with the increased MI risk (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.14-2.35, Pc = 0.021) compared to the CC genotype. Further stratified analysis revealed a more significant association with MI risk among younger subjects (\u2264 55 years old). Consistent with these results, the haplotype rs7069102G-rs3818292A-rs4746720T containing the rs7069102 G allele was also associated with the increased MI risk (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.09-1.84, Pc = 0.040). However, we did not detect any association of rs3818292 and rs4746720 with MI risk. Our study provides the first evidence that the tagSNP rs7069102 and haplotype rs7069102G-rs3818292A-rs4746720T in SIRT1 gene confer susceptibility to MI in the Chinese Han population.",

        "Abstract": "Genome maintenance (GM) is an essential defense system against aging and cancer, as both are characterized by increased genome instability. Here, we compared the copy number variation and mutation rate of 518 GM-associated genes in the naked mole rat (NMR), mouse, and human genomes. GM genes appeared to be strongly conserved, with copy number variation in only four genes. Interestingly, we found NMR to have a higher copy number of CEBPG, a regulator of DNA repair, and TINF2, a protector of telomere integrity. NMR, as well as human, was also found to have a lower rate of germline nucleotide substitution than the mouse. Together, the data suggest that the long-lived NMR, as well as human, has more robust GM than mouse and identifies new targets for the analysis of the exceptional longevity of the NMR.",

Dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in a myriad of diseases such as cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic disorders, making the IGF-1 signaling pathway a prime target to develop therapeutic and intervention strategies. Recently, small non-coding RNA molecules in \u223c22 nucleotide length, microRNAs (miRNAs), have emerged as a new regulator of biological processes in virtually all organ systems and increasing studies are linking altered miRNA function to disease mechanisms. A miRNA binds to 3'UTRs of multiple target genes and coordinately downregulates their expression, thereby exerting a profound influence on gene regulatory networks. Here we review the components of the IGF-1 signaling pathway that are known targets of miRNA regulation, and highlight recent studies that suggest therapeutic potential of these miRNAs against various diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a master regulator of hypoxic response and has been a prime therapeutic target for ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-derived myocardial dysfunction and tissue damage. There is also increasing evidence that HIF-1 plays a central role in regulating aging, both through interactions with key longevity factors including Sirtuins and mTOR, as well as by directly promoting longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans.We investigated a novel function and the underlying mechanism of syringaresinol, a lignan compound, in modulation of HIF-1 and protection against cellular damage and death in a cardiomyocyte model of I/R injury. Syringaresinol caused destabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 following H/R and then protected against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cellular damage, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction in a dose-dependent manner. Knock-down of FOXO3 by specific siRNAs completely abolished the ability of syringaresinol to inhibit HIF-1 stabilization and apoptosis caused by H/R. Syringaresinol stimulated the nuclear localization and activity of FOXO3 leading to increased expression of antioxidant genes and decreased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following H/R. Our results provide a new mechanistic insight into a functional role of syringaresinol against H/R-induced cardiomyocyte injury and death. The degradation of HIF-1\u03b1 through activation of FOXO3 is a potential therapeutic strategy for ischemia-related diseases.",

        "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. They are involved in important biological processes including development, homeostasis, and ageing. Recently, extracellular miRNAs have been discovered in the bloodstream and bodily fluids. These miRNAs are shown to be secreted and circulating in microvesicles (MVs), or in complex with other factors such as RNA-binding proteins and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. These cell-free, circulating miRNAs can be taken into and function as negative regulators of target genes in recipient cells. Here we review the biogenesis and uptake of circulating miRNAs as well as their profiles in ageing and ageing-related diseases. We discuss the emerging role of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",

        "Abstract": "Accumulation of DNA damage and mutations is considered an important causal factor in age-related diseases. Genetic defects in DNA repair cause premature onset and accelerated progression of age-related diseases and a shorter life span in humans and mice, providing strong evidence that genome maintenance is a bona fide longevity assurance pathway. However, the contribution of genome maintenance to human longevity itself remains to be established. Here, we review the results of human genetics studies, including genome wide association studies, and attempted to catalogue all genes involved in major DNA repair pathways that harbor variants associated with longevity. We hope to provide a comprehensive review to facilitate future endeavors aimed at uncovering the functional role of genome maintenance genes in human longevity.",

        "Abstract": "The activity of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a catabolic pathway for selective degradation of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes, decreases with age, but the consequences of this functional decline in vivo remain unknown. In this work, we have generated a conditional knockout mouse to selectively block CMA in liver. We have found that blockage of CMA causes hepatic glycogen depletion and hepatosteatosis. The liver phenotype is accompanied by reduced peripheral adiposity, increased energy expenditure, and altered glucose homeostasis. Comparative lysosomal proteomics revealed that key enzymes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are normally degraded by CMA and that impairment of their regulated degradation contributes to the metabolic abnormalities observed in CMA-defective animals. These findings highlight the involvement of CMA in regulating hepatic metabolism and suggest that the age-related decline in CMA may have a negative impact on the energetic balance in old organisms.",

Nar1p is required for the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear, but not of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins, and plays a role in modulating sensitivity to oxygen in both yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans through unknown mechanisms. Here we report that Nar1 deficiency results in shortened lifespan and sensitivity to paraquat that is rescued by increased expression of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase. These data suggest that Nar1p promotes protection against oxidative stress and define a new role for Nar1p in promoting replicative lifespan.",

        "Abstract": "miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that play an important role in numerous physiological processes. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pre-miRNAs may change their property through altering miRNAs expression and/or maturation, resulting in diverse functional consequences. To date, the role of genetic variants in pre-miRNAs on coronary artery disease (CAD) risk remains poorly understood. Here we aimed to evaluate the influence of three common SNPs in pre-miRNAs (miR-146a rs2910164 G>C, miR-196a2 rs11614913 C>T, miR-499 rs3746444 T>C) on individual susceptibility to CAD in a Chinese population of 295 CAD patients and 283 controls. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. In a logistic regression analysis, we detected an association of rs2910164 in pre-miR-146a with the CAD risk; compared with the GG homozygotes, the GC heterozygotes [odds ratio (OR)=1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.06-3.36, P=0.029] and the CC homozygotes (OR=1.83, 95% CI=1.01-3.32, P=0.046) genotype were statistically significantly associated with the increased risk for CADs. As we used further genotype association models, we found a similar trend of the association in recessive model (OR=1.86, 95% CI=1.09-3.19, P=0.023). We also found that the genotypes of miR-146a rs2910164 were associated with its mature miRNA expression by analyzing 23 PBMC samples from CAD patients. Individuals carrying rs11614913 GC or CC genotypes showed 3.2-fold higher expression compared to GG genotype carriers (P<0.05). We observed no association of the other two SNPs in miR-196a2 (rs11614913) and miR-499 (rs3746444) with the CAD incidence. Our data provide the first evidence that the miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism is associated with increased risk of CAD in Chinese Han population, which may be through influencing the expression levels of the miRNA.",

        "Abstract": "Genetic association studies of age-related, chronic human diseases often suffer from a lack of power to detect modest effects. Here we propose an alternative approach of including healthy centenarians as a more homogeneous and extreme control group. As a proof of principle we focused on type 2 diabetes (T2D) and assessed /genotypic associations of 31 SNPs associated with T2D, diabetes complications and metabolic diseases and SNPs of genes relevant for telomere stability and age-related diseases. We hypothesized that the frequencies of risk variants are inversely correlated with decreasing health and longevity. We performed association analyses comparing diabetic patients and non-diabetic controls followed by association analyses with extreme phenotypic groups (T2D patients with complications and centenarians). Results drew attention to rs7903146 (TCF7L2 gene) that showed a constant increase in the frequencies of risk genotype (TT) from centenarians to diabetic patients who developed macro-complications and the strongest genotypic association was detected when diabetic patients were compared to centenarians (p_value = 9.066*10\u207b\u2077). We conclude that robust and biologically relevant associations can be obtained when extreme phenotypes, even with a small sample size, are compared.",

A single miRNA can target up to several hundred mRNAs, thus capable of significantly altering gene expression regulatory networks. In-depth study and characterization of miRNAs has elucidated their critical functions in development, homeostasis, and disease. A link between miRNAs and longevity has been demonstrated in C. elegans, implicating their role in regulation of lifespan and in the aging process. Recent years have witnessed unprecedented technological advances in studies of miRNAs, including ultra-high throughput sequencing technologies that allow comprehensive discovery of miRNAs and their targets. Here we review the latest experimental approaches from the perspective of understanding miRNA gene expression regulatory networks in aging. We provide a methodological work flow that can be employed to discover aging-related miRNAs and their targets, and to functionally validate their roles in aging. Finally, we review the links between miRNAs known to act in the conserved pathways of aging and major aging-related diseases. Taken together, we hope to provide a focused review to facilitate future endeavor of uncovering the functional role of miRNA in aging.",

The potential beneficial effects of SIRT1 have made SIRT1 a prime therapeutic target for age-related diseases and considerable efforts led to the identification of small molecule activator of SIRT1 protein. Thus far, however, a small molecule activator of SIRT1 gene expression has not been reported. Here, we report that syringaresinol, isolated from Panax ginseng berry pulp, is an activator of SIRT1 gene expression. Using human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs), we show that syringaresinol treatment induced binding of FOXO3 to the SIRT1 promoter in a sequence-specific manner, leading to induction of SIRT1 expression. Increased SIRT1 expression in HUVECs by syringaresinol treatment delayed cellular senescence and improved various markers of endothelial functions in a FOXO3 dependent manner. Collectively, these findings bring to light a new transcription activator of SIRT1 that may have therapeutic potential.",

        "Abstract": "Genome instability has long been implicated as the main causal factor in aging. Somatic cells are continuously exposed to various sources of DNA damage, from reactive oxygen species to UV radiation to environmental mutagens. To cope with the tens of thousands of chemical lesions introduced into the genome of a typical cell each day, a complex network of genome maintenance systems acts to remove damage and restore the correct base pair sequence. Occasionally, however, repair is erroneous, and such errors, as well as the occasional failure to correctly replicate the genome during cell division, are the basis for mutations and epimutations. There is now ample evidence that mutations accumulate in various organs and tissues of higher animals, including humans, mice, and flies. What is not known, however, is whether the frequency of these random changes is sufficient to cause the phenotypic effects generally associated with aging. The exception is cancer, an age-related disease caused by the accumulation of mutations and epimutations. Here, we first review current concepts regarding the relationship between DNA damage, repair, and mutation, as well as the data regarding genome alterations as a function of age. We then describe a model for how randomly induced DNA sequence and epigenomic variants in the somatic genomes of animals can result in functional decline and disease in old age. Finally, we discuss the genetics of genome instability in relation to longevity to address the importance of alterations in the somatic genome as a causal factor in aging and to underscore the opportunities provided by genetic approaches to develop interventions that attenuate genome instability, reduce disease risk, and increase life span.",

        "Abstract": "Despite evidence of a substantial genetic component, the genetic factors that underlie longevity in humans remain to be identified. Previous genome-wide linkage and association studies have not found strong evidence for the contribution of common variants besides the APOE gene, suggesting the role of rare variants in human longevity. To discover rare variants that might contribute to longevity, we selected 988 candidate genes and performed a pilot study to identify novel non-synonymous variants in 6 Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians older than 105. Our candidate genes act in pathways implicated in aging and longevity, including neurodegeneration, cognitive function, lipid metabolism, DNA repair, and genome maintenance. By implementing custom-designed Agilent SureSelect target capture and next-generation sequencing, we discovered a total of 89 novel non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) and validated 51 nsSNPs by iPLEX MassArray assays. Genotyping analysis of these novel SNPs in 410 Ashkenazi Jewish controls and 390 centenarians showed significant enrichment (5.3 fold, p = 0.02) of the p.Y318C variant in PMS2 and significant depletion (7.5 fold, p = 0.04) of the p.V465A variant in GABRR3 in centenarians compared to controls. Our study presents the potential of targeted next-generation sequencing for discovery of rare but functional genetic variation which may lead to exceptional longevity in humans.",

        "Abstract": "SIRT1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein deacetylase that modulates stress response, cellular metabolism and aging in model organisms. While SIRT1 exerts beneficial effects in protecting against age-related diseases, the role of SIRT1 in cancer has been controversial. SIRT1 promotes cell survival by deacetylating, and thereby negatively regulating the activity of important tumor suppressors such as p53. In this regard, SIRT1 has been considered to be a potential oncogene, and SIRT1 inhibitors have been studied for possible anticancer therapeutic effects. In contrast, it has been shown that SIRT1 deficiency leads to increased genomic instability and tumorigenesis, and that overexpression of SIRT1 attenuates cancer formation in mice, suggesting it may also act as a tumor suppressor. Based on this evidence, SIRT1-activating molecules could act as candidate chemotherapeutic drugs. In order to gain insight into the role of SIRT1 in cancer, we performed a comprehensive resequencing analysis of the SIRT1 gene in 41 tumor cell lines and found an unusually excessive homozygosity, which was confirmed to be allelic loss by microsatellite analysis. Furthermore, we found two novel SIRT1 mutations (D739Y and R65_A72del) in addition to the known, rare non-synonymous variation resulting in I731V. In vitro assays using purified SIRT1 protein showed that these mutations do not alter SIRT1 deacetylase activity or telomerase activity, which was shown to be regulated by SIRT1. We conclude that allelic loss or mutations in the SIRT1 gene occur prevalently during tumorigenesis, supporting the assertion that SIRT1 may serve as a tumor suppressor.",

        "Abstract": "Abnormal splicing of LMNA gene or aberrant processing of prelamin A results in progeroid syndrome. Here we show that lamin A interacts with and activates SIRT1. SIRT1 exhibits reduced association with nuclear matrix (NM) and decreased deacetylase activity in the presence of progerin or prelamin A,\u00a0leading to rapid depletion of adult stem cells (ASCs) in Zmpste24(-/-) mice. Resveratrol enhances the binding between SIRT1 and A-type lamins to increases its deacetylase activity. Resveratrol treatment rescues ASC decline, slows down body weight loss, improves trabecular bone structure and mineral density, and significantly extends the life span in Zmpste24(-/-) mice. Our data demonstrate lamin A as an activator of SIRT1 and provide a mechanistic explanation for the activation of SIRT1 by resveratrol. The link between conserved SIRT1 longevity pathway and progeria suggests a stem cell-based and SIRT1 pathway-dependent therapeutic strategy for progeria.",

        "Abstract": "\u03b2-adrenoceptors are the common pharmacological targets for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and asthma. Genetic modifications of \u03b2-adrenergic system in engineered mice affect their lifespan. Here, we tested whether genes encoding for key components of the \u03b2-adrenergic signaling pathway are associated with human longevity. We performed a 10-year follow-up study of the Chinese longitudinal healthy longevity survey. The Han Chinese population in this study consisted of 963 long-lived and 1028 geography-matched young individuals. Sixteen SNPs from ADRB1, ADRB2, ADCY5, ADCY6, and MAPK1 were selected and genotyped. Two SNPs, rs1042718 (C/A) and rs1042719 (G/C), of ADRB2 in linkage disequilibrium (D' = 1.0; r2 = 0.67) were found to be associated with enhanced longevity in men in two geographically isolated populations. Bonferroni-corrected P-values in a combined analysis were 0.00053-0.010. Men with haplotype A-C showed an increased probability to become centenarians (the frequency of A-C in long-lived and young individuals are 0.332 and 0.250, respectively, OR = 1.49, CI 95% = 1.17-1.88, P = 0.0007), in contrast to those with haplotype C-G (the frequency of C-G in long-lived and young individuals are 0.523 and 0.635, respectively, OR = 0.63, CI 95% = 0.51-0.78, P = 0.000018). The permuted P-values were 0.00005 and 0.0009, respectively. ADRB2 encodes the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor; the haplotype A-C markedly reduced its translational efficiency compared with C-G (P = 0.002) in transfected HEK293 cells. Thus, our data indicate that enhanced production of \u03b22-adrenergic receptors caused by genetic variants is inversely associated with human lifespan.",

        "Abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have attracted considerable attention in the fields of cell and gene therapy due to their intrinsic ability to differentiate into multiple lineages. The various therapeutic applications involving MSC require initial expansion and/or differentiation in vitro prior to clinical use. However, serial passages of MSC in culture lead to decreased differentiation potential and stem cell characteristics, eventually inducing cellular aging which will limit the success of cell-based therapeutic interventions. Here we review the age-related changes that occur in MSC with a special focus on the shift of differentiation potential from osteogenic to adipogenic lineage during the MSC aging processes and how aging causes this preferential shift by oxidative stress and/or energy metabolism defect. Oxidative stress-related signals and some microRNAs affect the differentiation potential shift of MSC by directly targeting key regulatory factors such as Runx-2 or PPAR-\u03b3, and energy metabolism pathway is involved as well. All information described here including transcription factors, microRNAs and FoxOs could be used towards development of treatment regimens for age-related bone diseases and related defects based on mutually exclusive lineage fate determination of MSC.",

        "Abstract": "Age is a major risk factor for many human diseases. Extremely long-lived individuals, such as centenarians, have managed to ward off age-related diseases and serve as human models to search for the genetic factors that influence longevity. The discovery of evolutionarily conserved pathways with major impact on life span in animal models has provided tantalizing opportunities to test the relevance of these pathways for human longevity. Here we specifically focus on the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling as a prime candidate pathway. Coupled with the rapid advances in ultra high-throughput sequencing technologies, it is now feasible to comprehensively analyze all possible sequence variants in candidate genes segregating with a longevity phenotype and to investigate the functional consequences of the associated variants. A better understanding of the functional genes that affect healthy longevity in humans may lead to a rational basis for intervention strategies that can delay or prevent age-related diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Activation of Sir2 orthologs is proposed to increase lifespan downstream of dietary restriction. Here, we describe an examination of the effect of 32 different lifespan-extending mutations and four methods of DR on replicative lifespan (RLS) in the short-lived sir2\u0394 yeast strain. In every case, deletion of SIR2 prevented RLS extension; however, RLS extension was restored when both SIR2 and FOB1 were deleted in several cases, demonstrating that SIR2 is not directly required for RLS extension. These findings indicate that suppression of the sir2\u0394 lifespan defect is a rare phenotype among longevity interventions and suggest that sir2\u0394 cells senesce rapidly by a mechanism distinct from that of wild-type cells. They also demonstrate that failure to observe lifespan extension in a short-lived background, such as cells or animals lacking sirtuins, should be interpreted with caution.",

The goal was to promote interaction, collaboration, and exchange of ideas between scientists in the field of aging research from Japan, South Korea, and China. Aging research is on the rise in Asia. This represents an important development, since Korea and Japan are the two longest-lived countries in the world, and life expectancy is increasing rapidly in China and other Asian countries. The world will see a greater percentage of people over age 65 in coming years than any period in human history. Developing therapeutic approaches to increase healthspan has the potential not only to enhance quality of life, but would also help stem the looming economic crisis associated with a high percentage of elderly. The focus of the Trinations Aging Symposium was on the basic biology of aging, and topics discussed included genome maintenance, metabolism and aging, longevity genes and interventions, and new therapies for age-related diseases. The meeting finished with a commitment for another symposium next year that will include additional Asian countries and the formation of a new scientific organization, the Asian Association for Aging Research.",

        "Abstract": "Dampening of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) signaling results in the extension of lifespan in invertebrate as well as murine models. The impact of this evolutionarily conserved pathway on the modulation of human lifespan remains unclear. We previously identified two IGF1R mutations (Ala-37-Thr and Arg-407-His) that are enriched in Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians as compared to younger controls and are associated with the reduced activity of the IGF1 receptor as measured in immortalized lymphocytes. To determine whether these human longevity-associated IGF1R mutations affect IGF1 signaling, we engineered mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing the different human IGF1R variants in a mouse Igf1r null background. The results indicate that MEFs expressing the human longevity-associated IGF1R mutations attenuated IGF1 signaling, as demonstrated by significant reduction in phosphorylation of both IGF1R and AKT after IGF1 treatment, in comparison with MEFs expressing the wild-type IGF1R. The impaired IGF1 signaling caused by the IGF1R mutations resulted in the reduced induction of the major IGF1-activated genes in MEFs, including EGR1, mCSF, IL3R\u03b1, and TDAG51. Furthermore, the IGF1R mutations caused a delay in cell cycle progression after IGF1 treatment, indicating a dysfunctional physiological response to a cell proliferation signal. These results demonstrate that the human longevity-associated IGF1R variants are reduced-function mutations, implying that dampening of IGF1 signaling may be a longevity mechanism in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Human diploid fibroblasts have the capacity to complete a finite number of cell divisions before entering a state of replicative senescence characterized by growth arrest, changes in morphology, and altered gene expression. Herein, we report that interaction with extracellular matrix (ECM) from young cells is sufficient to restore aged, senescent cells to an apparently youthful state. The identity of the restored cells as having been derived from senescent cells has been confirmed by a variety of methods, including time lapse live cell imaging and DNA finger print analysis. In addition to cell morphology, phenotypic restoration was assessed by resumption of proliferative potential, growth factor responsiveness, reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, recovery of mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased telomere length. Mechanistically, we find that both Ku and SIRT1 are induced during restoration and are required for senescent cells to return to a youthful phenotype. These observations demonstrate that human cellular senescence is profoundly influenced by cues from the ECM, and that senescent cell plasticity is much greater than that was previously believed to be the case.",

        "Abstract": "Aging is a natural process that involves a general decline in many physiological functions, resulting in loss of function and eventually death. Extensive research is being performed in order to elucidate the biology of aging, especially with the advent of newer molecular and genetic methodologies. The endocrine system plays a major role in orchestrating cellular interactions, metabolism, growth, and senescence. Thus, researchers traditionally used hormones as tools to induce and examine specific biological effects that are associated with aging. Furthermore, because our recent knowledge on hormonal action expanded significantly, downstream pathways and genetic determinants currently prevail in aging research. In this review, we will summarize the effects of several hormones on human aging and longevity and present recent data from the Longevity Genes Study performed at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, looking at the phenotype and genotype of centenarians and their offspring. We will demonstrate that genetic factors that are associated with human longevity are heritable and may contribute not only to quantitative longevity but also to protection from age-dependent disease and exceptional good health.",

        "Abstract": "Although AIMP3/p18 is normally associated with the macromolecular tRNA synthetase complex, recent reports have revealed a new role of AIMP3 in tumor suppression. In this study, we generated a transgenic mouse that overexpresses AIMP3 and characterized the associated phenotype in vivo and in vitro. Surprisingly, the AIMP3 transgenic mouse exhibited a progeroid phenotype, and the cells that overexpressed AIMP3 showed accelerated senescence and defects in nuclear morphology. We found that overexpression of AIMP3 resulted in proteasome-dependent degradation of mature lamin A, but not of lamin C, prelamin A, or progerin. The resulting imbalance in the protein levels of lamin A isoforms, namely altered stoichiometry of prelamin A and progerin to lamin A, appeared to be responsible for a phenotype that resembled progeria. An increase in the level of endogenous AIMP3 has been observed in aged human tissues and cells. The findings in this report suggest that AIMP3 is a specific regulator of mature lamin A and imply that enhanced expression of AIMP3 might be a factor driving cellular and/or organismal aging.",

        "Abstract": "Telomere length in humans is emerging as a biomarker of aging because its shortening is associated with aging-related diseases and early mortality. However, genetic mechanisms responsible for these associations are not known. Here, in a cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians, their offspring, and offspring-matched controls, we studied the inheritance and maintenance of telomere length and variations in two major genes associated with telomerase enzyme activity, hTERT and hTERC. We demonstrated that centenarians and their offspring maintain longer telomeres compared with controls with advancing age and that longer telomeres are associated with protection from age-related diseases, better cognitive function, and lipid profiles of healthy aging. Sequence analysis of hTERT and hTERC showed overrepresentation of synonymous and intronic mutations among centenarians relative to controls. Moreover, we identified a common hTERT haplotype that is associated with both exceptional longevity and longer telomere length. Thus, variations in human telomerase gene that are associated with better maintenance of telomere length may confer healthy aging and exceptional longevity in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Activating signal cointegrator-2 (ASC-2), a transcriptional coactivator of multiple transcription factors that include the adipogenic factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and C/EBPalpha, is associated with histone H3-Lys-4-methyltransferase (H3K4MT) MLL3 or its paralogue MLL4 in a complex named ASCOM (ASC-2 complex). Indeed, ASC-2-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have been demonstrated to be refractory to PPARgamma-stimulated adipogenesis and fail to express the PPARgamma-responsive adipogenic marker gene aP2. However, the specific roles for MLL3 and MLL4 in adipogenesis remain undefined. Here, we provide evidence that MLL3 plays crucial roles in adipogenesis. First, MLL3(Delta/Delta) mice expressing a H3K4MT-inactivated mutant of MLL3 have significantly less white fat. Second, MLL3(Delta/Delta) MEFs are mildly but consistently less responsive to inducers of adipogenesis than WT MEFs. Third, ASC-2, MLL3, and MLL4 are recruited to the PPARgamma-activated aP2 gene during adipogenesis, and PPARgamma is shown to interact directly with the purified ASCOM. Moreover, although H3K4 methylation of aP2 is readily induced in WT MEFs, it is not induced in ASC-2(-/-) MEFs and only partially induced in MLL3(Delta/Delta) MEFs. These results suggest that ASCOM-MLL3 and ASCOM-MLL4 likely function as crucial but redundant H3K4MT complexes for PPARgamma-dependent adipogenesis.",

        "Title": "Effect of Ku80 deficiency on mutation frequencies and spectra at a LacZ reporter locus in mouse tissues and cells.",
        "Abstract": "Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is thought to be an important mechanism for preventing the adverse effects of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and its absence has been associated with premature aging. To investigate the effect of inactivated NHEJ on spontaneous mutation frequencies and spectra in vivo and in cultured cells, we crossed a Ku80-deficient mouse with mice harboring a lacZ-plasmid-based mutation reporter. We analyzed various organs and tissues, as well as cultured embryonic fibroblasts, for mutations at the lacZ locus. When comparing mutant with wild-type mice, we observed a significantly higher number of genome rearrangements in liver and spleen and a significantly lower number of point mutations in liver and brain. The reduced point mutation frequency was not due to a decrease in small deletion mutations thought to be a hallmark of NHEJ, but could be a consequence of increased cellular responses to unrepaired DSBs. Indeed, we found a substantial increase in persistent 53BP1 and gammaH2AX DNA damage foci in Ku80-/- as compared to wild-type liver. Treatment of cultured Ku80-deficient or wild-type embryonic fibroblasts, either proliferating or quiescent, with hydrogen peroxide or bleomycin showed no differences in the number or type of induced genome rearrangements. However, after such treatment, Ku80-deficient cells did show an increased number of persistent DNA damage foci. These results indicate that Ku80-dependent repair of DNA damage is predominantly error-free with the effect of alternative more error-prone pathways creating genome rearrangements only detectable after extended periods of time, i.e., in young adult animals. The observed premature aging likely results from a combination of increased cellular senescence and an increased load of stable, genome rearrangements.",

        "Abstract": "Mutant dwarf and calorie-restricted mice benefit from healthy aging and unusually long lifespan. In contrast, mouse models for DNA repair-deficient progeroid syndromes age and die prematurely. To identify mechanisms that regulate mammalian longevity, we quantified the parallels between the genome-wide liver expression profiles of mice with those two extremes of lifespan. Contrary to expectation, we find significant, genome-wide expression associations between the progeroid and long-lived mice. Subsequent analysis of significantly over-represented biological processes revealed suppression of the endocrine and energy pathways with increased stress responses in both delayed and premature aging. To test the relevance of these processes in natural aging, we compared the transcriptomes of liver, lung, kidney, and spleen over the entire murine adult lifespan and subsequently confirmed these findings on an independent aging cohort. The majority of genes showed similar expression changes in all four organs, indicating a systemic transcriptional response with aging. This systemic response included the same biological processes that are triggered in progeroid and long-lived mice. However, on a genome-wide scale, transcriptomes of naturally aged mice showed a strong association to progeroid but not to long-lived mice. Thus, endocrine and metabolic changes are indicative of \"survival\" responses to genotoxic stress or starvation, whereas genome-wide associations in gene expression with natural aging are indicative of biological age, which may thus delineate pro- and anti-aging effects of treatments aimed at health-span extension.",

        "Abstract": "Unrepaired or misrepaired DNA damage has been implicated as a causal factor in cancer and aging. Xpd(TTD) mice, harboring defects in nucleotide excision repair and transcription due to a mutation in the Xpd gene (R722W), display severe symptoms of premature aging but have a reduced incidence of cancer. To gain further insight into the molecular basis of the mutant-specific manifestation of age-related phenotypes, we used comparative microarray analysis of young and old female livers to discover gene expression signatures distinguishing Xpd(TTD) mice from their age-matched wild type controls. We found a transcription signature of increased apoptosis in the Xpd(TTD) mice, which was confirmed by in situ immunohistochemical analysis and found to be accompanied by increased proliferation. However, apoptosis rate exceeded the rate of proliferation, resulting in homeostatic imbalance. Interestingly, a metabolic response signature was observed involving decreased energy metabolism and reduced IGF-1 signaling, a major modulator of life span. We conclude that while the increased apoptotic response to endogenous DNA damage contributes to the accelerated aging phenotypes and the reduced cancer incidence observed in the Xpd(TTD) mice, the signature of reduced energy metabolism is likely to reflect a compensatory adjustment to limit the increased genotoxic stress in these mutants. These results support a general model for premature aging in DNA repair deficient mice based on cellular responses to DNA damage that impair normal tissue homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Rather than being a passive, haphazard process of wear and tear, lifespan can be modulated actively by components of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor I (IGFI) pathway in laboratory animals. Complete or partial loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding components of the insulin/IGFI pathway result in extension of life span in yeasts, worms, flies, and mice. This remarkable conservation throughout evolution suggests that altered signaling in this pathway may also influence human lifespan. On the other hand, evolutionary tradeoffs predict that the laboratory findings may not be relevant to human populations, because of the high fitness cost during early life. Here, we studied the biochemical, phenotypic, and genetic variations in a cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians, their offspring, and offspring-matched controls and demonstrated a gender-specific increase in serum IGFI associated with a smaller stature in female offspring of centenarians. Sequence analysis of the IGF1 and IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) genes of female centenarians showed overrepresentation of heterozygous mutations in the IGF1R gene among centenarians relative to controls that are associated with high serum IGFI levels and reduced activity of the IGFIR as measured in transformed lymphocytes. Thus, genetic alterations in the human IGF1R that result in altered IGF signaling pathway confer an increase in susceptibility to human longevity, suggesting a role of this pathway in modulation of human lifespan.",

        "Abstract": "Gastric carcinoma is considered to be one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide. We have performed differential-display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) in order to compare the gene expression profile of gastric carcinoma and that of a normal stomach, in an attempt to identifiy differentially expressed genes associated with primary human gastric cancers. One of the down-regulated genes in gastric cancers was identified as regenerating islet-derived 3 alpha (REG3A), also known as hepatocarcinoma-intestine-pancreas/ pancreatitis-associated protein (HIP/PAP). REG3A exhibited relatively high expression levels in normal gastric mucosa. However, REG3A was found to be down-regulated in 67% (20 out of 30 samples) of primary human gastric cancers, as determined by RT-PCR. In addition, REG3A mRNA expression was not detected in stomach cancer cell lines, SNU cells. Immunohistochemical analysis further confirmed the down-regulation of REG3A expression in primary human gastric cancers. Treatment with the demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) resulted in the restoration of REG3A mRNA expression in the gastric cancer cell line, indicating that the transcriptional silencing of REG3A in SNU cell lines was caused by DNA methylation. Taken together, these data indicate that REG3A is down-regulated in most primary human gastric cancer cells, and might be useful in the diagnosis of gastric cancer. Further characterization of the differentially expressed gene, REG3A, should lead to a better understanding of the changes occurring at the molecular level during the development and progression of primary human gastric cancer.",

        "Title": "Adaptive stress response in segmental progeria resembles long-lived dwarfism and calorie restriction in mice.",
        "Abstract": "How congenital defects causing genome instability can result in the pleiotropic symptoms reminiscent of aging but in a segmental and accelerated fashion remains largely unknown. Most segmental progerias are associated with accelerated fibroblast senescence, suggesting that cellular senescence is a likely contributing mechanism. Contrary to expectations, neither accelerated senescence nor acute oxidative stress hypersensitivity was detected in primary fibroblast or erythroblast cultures from multiple progeroid mouse models for defects in the nucleotide excision DNA repair pathway, which share premature aging features including postnatal growth retardation, cerebellar ataxia, and death before weaning. Instead, we report a prominent phenotypic overlap with long-lived dwarfism and calorie restriction during postnatal development (2 wk of age), including reduced size, reduced body temperature, hypoglycemia, and perturbation of the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 neuroendocrine axis. These symptoms were also present at 2 wk of age in a novel progeroid nucleotide excision repair-deficient mouse model (XPD(G602D/R722W)/XPA(-/-)) that survived weaning with high penetrance. However, despite persistent cachectic dwarfism, blood glucose and serum insulin-like growth factor 1 levels returned to normal by 10 wk, with hypoglycemia reappearing near premature death at 5 mo of age. These data strongly suggest changes in energy metabolism as part of an adaptive response during the stressful period of postnatal growth. Interestingly, a similar perturbation of the postnatal growth axis was not detected in another progeroid mouse model, the double-strand DNA break repair deficient Ku80(-/-) mouse. Specific (but not all) types of genome instability may thus engage a conserved response to stress that evolved to cope with environmental pressures such as food shortage.",

        "Abstract": "Aging of somatic cells can be defined as the gradual loss of the information embedded in the global and local properties of complex macromolecular networks. This loss of information may reflect the dynamic interplay between stochastic factors, such as the accumulation of unrepaired somatic damage, and gene-encoded programmatic responses. This would ultimately result in loss of function, impaired response to environmental challenge, and a progressively increased incidence of disease. Here the authors present the case for aging as a continuous battle between maintaining genomic integrity and ensuring sufficient cell functional mass. Focusing on aging of the liver in rodents, evidence is presented that normal aging is associated with a gradual accumulation of random alterations in the DNA of the genome as a consequence of imperfect DNA repair and a decrease in the rate of DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis is the cell's genome maintenance mechanism of last resort and an imbalance towards apoptosis can contribute to manifestations of aging-related phenotypes, as exemplified by mouse models of premature aging due to genetic defects in genome maintenance. Prospects to reset the clock in this zero sum game between survival and the maintenance of phenotypic integrity will be discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Reactive oxygen species have been implicated as a cause of cancer and aging in mammals. Mice deficient for the antioxidant enzyme CuZn-superoxide dismutase (Sod1) have a decreased life span and an elevated incidence of liver cancer. To test the hypothesis that the cancer-prone phenotype in such mice is due to accelerated spontaneous mutation accumulation, we crossed these mutants with mice harboring a neutral lacZ mutation reporter gene. At 2 months of age, the lacZ mutation frequency in the liver of the hybrid animals was already twice as high as in littermate controls of the same age. This difference in mutation frequency increased to >3-fold at 6 months of age, after which it did not increase any further. Characterization of the mutation spectra in liver of the Sod1-null mice indicated mainly GC-to-TA transversions and GC-to-AT transitions, signature mutations of oxidative stress. The accelerated mutation accumulation in liver was accompanied by an increased frequency of apoptotic cells, as indicated by an increase in both terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling- and caspase 3-stained cells at 6 and 12 months of age. In kidney, an elevated mutation frequency above controls of approximately 2.5-fold was found not earlier than at 6 months. No increased mutation accumulation was observed in brain or spleen. These results support the hypothesis, that oxidative stress is an important causal factor of cancer in mammals.",

        "Abstract": "With the completion of the human genome project, attention is now rapidly shifting towards the study of individual genetic variation. The most abundant source of genetic variation in the human genome is represented by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which can account for heritable inter-individual differences in complex phenotypes. Identification of SNPs that contribute to susceptibility to common diseases will provide highly accurate diagnostic information that will facilitate early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of human diseases. Over the past several years, the advancement of increasingly high-throughput and cost-effective methods to discover and measure SNPs has begun to open the door towards this endeavor. Genetic association studies are considered to be an effective approach towards the detection of SNPs with moderate effects, as in most common diseases with complex phenotypes. This requires careful study design, analysis and interpretation. In this review, we discuss genetic association studies and address the prospect for candidate gene association studies, comparing the strengths and weaknesses of indirect and direct study designs. Our focus is on the continuous need for SNP discovery methods and the use of currently available prescreening methods for large-scale genetic epidemiological research until more advanced sequencing methods currently under development will become available.",

        "Abstract": "Longevity, i.e., the property of being long-lived, has its natural limitation in the aging process. Longevity has a strong genetic component, as has become apparent from studies with a variety of organisms, from yeast to humans. Genetic screening efforts with invertebrates have unraveled multiple genetic pathways that suggest longevity is promoted through the manipulation of metabolism and the resistance to oxidative stress. To some extent, these same mechanisms appear to act in mammals also, despite considerable divergence during evolution. Thus far, evidence from population-based studies with humans suggests the importance of genes involved in cardiovascular disease as important determinants of longevity. The challenge is to test if the candidate longevity genes that have emerged from studies with model organisms exhibit genetic variation for life span in human populations. Future investigations are likely to involve large-scale case-control studies, in which large numbers of genes, corresponding to entire gene functional modules, will be assessed for all possible sequence variation and associated with detailed phenotypic information on each individual over extended periods of time. This should eventually unravel the genetic factors that contribute to each particular aging phenotype.",

        "Abstract": "Aberrant membrane transport caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene is associated with a wide spectrum of respiratory and digestive diseases as well as cystic fibrosis. Using a gene scanning method, we found 11 polymorphisms and mutations of the CFTR gene in the Korean population. Individual variants at these sites were analyzed by conventional DNA screening in 117 control and 75 patients having bronchiectasis or chronic pancreatitis. In a haplotype determination based on a Bayesian algorithm, 15 haplotypes were assembled in the 192 individuals tested. Several haplotypes, especially with Q1352H, IVS8 T5, and E217G, were found to have disease associations in a case-control study. Notably, a common polymorphism of M470V appears to affect the intensity of the disease association. Among the two haplotypes having IVS8 T5, the T5-V470 haplotype showed higher disease association than the T5-M470 haplotype. In addition, a Q1352H mutation found in a V470 background showed the strongest disease association. The physiological significances of the identified mutations were rigorously analyzed. Non-synonymous E217G and Q1352H mutations in the M470 background caused a 60-80% reduction in CFTR-dependent Cl(-) currents and HCO3(-) -transport activities. Surprisingly, the additional M470V polymorphic variant with the Q1352H mutation completely abolished CFTR-dependent anion transport activities. These findings provide the first evidence on the importance of CFTR mutations in the Asian population. Importantly, the results also reveal that interactions between multiple genetic variants in cis affect the final function of the gene products.",

        "Abstract": "Ageing is the most complex phenotype currently known, since it becomes manifest in all organs and tissues, affects an organism's entire physiology, impacts function at all levels and increases susceptibility to all major chronic diseases. Insight into the molecular and cellular targets of the ageing process would offer the unprecedented opportunity to postpone and prevent some, if not all, of its deteriorative aspects by preventive and therapeutic means. Thus far, our understanding of the causes of ageing is limited. To an important extent this is due to our inability, in the past, to study ageing systems. Instead, ample information has been gathered about individual cellular components at various ages, but this has not allowed a clear understanding of the integrated genomic circuits that control mechanisms of ageing, survival and stress responses. With the emergence of functional genomics, we finally have the opportunity to study ageing in a comprehensive manner, as a function of the dynamic network of genes that determines the physiology of an individual organism over time.",

        "Title": "Cell signaling in aging and apoptosis.",
        "Abstract": "Alterations in apoptotic potential, due to perturbations in cell signaling cascades, could underlie age-related organ-specific cellular degeneration and death. While increased apoptosis could lead to cell loss, as in neuronal degeneration, loss of apoptosis competence might well result in the loss of phenotypic fidelity of somatic cells, which could explain to some extent, the age-related increase in cancer incidence. Results from our laboratory indicate that after subjecting young and old rats to genotoxic stress in the form of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), an apoptotic response is quickly mounted in the liver of the young animals but virtually absent in the same organ of old animals (Nature Med. 8 (2002) 3). To address the possible molecular signaling defect(s) responsible for the age-related dysfunction of apoptosis in response to MMS, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38 MAPKs, were evaluated in the liver of young and old rats after MMS treatment. The results demonstrated distinct age-specific patterns of MMS-induced MAPKs activation, suggesting that the balance between cell survival and apoptosis after genotoxic stress may be impaired during aging. These results are discussed in terms of the relative importance in aging of biological redundancy, a concept put forward by the late Bernard Strehler, and cellular fidelity.",
