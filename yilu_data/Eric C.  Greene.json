        "Abstract": "Srs2 is an Sf1a helicase that helps maintain genome stability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae through its ability to regulate homologous recombination. Srs2 downregulates HR by stripping Rad51 from single-stranded DNA, and Srs2 is also thought to promote synthesis-dependent strand annealing by unwinding D-loops. However, it has not been possible to evaluate the relative contributions of these two distinct activities to any aspect of recombination. Here, we used a structure-based approach to design an Srs2 separation-of-function mutant that can dismantle Rad51-ssDNA filaments but is incapable of disrupting D-loops, allowing us to assess the relative contributions of these pro- and anti-recombinogenic functions. We show that this separation-of-function mutant phenocopies wild-type SRS2 in vivo, suggesting that the ability of Srs2 to remove Rad51 from ssDNA is its primary role during HR.",

Type V-K CASTs offer potential technology advantages but lack accuracy, and the molecular basis for this drawback has remained elusive. Here, we reveal that type V-K CASTs maintain an RNA-independent, \"untargeted\" transposition pathway alongside RNA-dependent integration, driven by the local availability of TnsC filaments. Using cryo-electron microscopy, single-molecule experiments, and high-throughput sequencing, we found that a minimal, CRISPR-less transpososome preferentially directs untargeted integration at AT-rich sites, with additional local specificity imparted by TnsB. By exploiting this knowledge, we suppressed untargeted transposition and increased type V-K CAST specificity up to 98.1% in cells without compromising on-target integration efficiency. These findings will inform further engineering of CAST systems for accurate, kilobase-scale genome engineering applications.",

        "Abstract": "Unlike canonical CRISPR-Cas systems that rely on RNA-guided nucleases for target cleavage, CRISPR-associated transposases (CASTs) repurpose nuclease-deficient CRISPR effectors to facilitate RNA-guided transposition of large genetic payloads. Type V-K CASTs offer several potential upsides for genome engineering, due to their compact size, easy programmability, and unidirectional integration. However, these systems are substantially less accurate than type I-F CASTs, and the molecular basis for this difference has remained elusive. Here we reveal that type V-K CASTs undergo two distinct mobilization pathways with remarkably different specificities: RNA-dependent and RNA-independent transposition. Whereas RNA-dependent transposition relies on Cas12k for accurate target selection, RNA-independent integration events are untargeted and primarily driven by the local availability of TnsC filaments. The cryo-EM structure of the untargeted complex reveals a TnsB-TnsC-TniQ transpososome that encompasses two turns of a TnsC filament and otherwise resembles major architectural aspects of the Cas12k-containing transpososome. Using single-molecule experiments and genome-wide meta-analyses, we found that AT-rich sites are preferred substrates for untargeted transposition and that the TnsB transposase also imparts local specificity, which collectively determine the precise insertion site. Knowledge of these motifs allowed us to direct untargeted transposition events to specific hotspot regions of a plasmid. Finally, by exploiting TnsB's preference for on-target integration and modulating the availability of TnsC, we suppressed RNA-independent transposition events and increased type V-K CAST specificity up to 98.1%, without compromising the efficiency of on-target integration. Collectively, our results reveal the importance of dissecting target site selection mechanisms and highlight new opportunities to leverage CAST systems for accurate, kilobase-scale genome engineering applications.",

        "Abstract": "Pif1 is a broadly conserved helicase that is essential for genome integrity and participates in numerous aspects of DNA metabolism, including telomere length regulation, Okazaki fragment maturation, replication fork progression through difficult-to-replicate sites, replication fork convergence, and break-induced replication. However, details of its translocation properties and the importance of amino acids residues implicated in DNA binding remain unclear. Here, we use total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy with single-molecule DNA curtain assays to directly observe the movement of fluorescently tagged Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrates. We find that Pif1 binds tightly to ssDNA and translocates very rapidly (\u223c350 nucleotides per second) in the 5'\u21923' direction over relatively long distances (\u223c29,500 nucleotides). Surprisingly, we show the ssDNA-binding protein replication protein A inhibits Pif1 activity in both bulk biochemical and single-molecule measurements. However, we demonstrate Pif1 can strip replication protein A from ssDNA, allowing subsequent molecules of Pif1 to translocate unimpeded. We also assess the functional attributes of several Pif1 mutations predicted to impair contact with the ssDNA substrate. Taken together, our findings highlight the functional importance of these amino acid residues in coordinating the movement of Pif1 along ssDNA.",

        "Title": "Repair of mismatched templates during Rad51-dependent Break-Induced Replication.",
        "Abstract": "Using budding yeast, we have studied Rad51-dependent break-induced replication (BIR), where the invading 3' end of a site-specific double-strand break (DSB) and a donor template share 108 bp of homology that can be easily altered. BIR still occurs about 10% as often when every 6th base is mismatched as with a perfectly matched donor. Here we explore the tolerance of mismatches in more detail, by examining donor templates that each carry 10 mismatches, each with different spatial arrangements. Although 2 of the 6 arrangements we tested were nearly as efficient as the evenly-spaced reference, 4 were significantly less efficient. A donor with all 10 mismatches clustered at the 3' invading end of the DSB was not impaired compared to arrangements where mismatches were clustered at the 5' end. Our data suggest that the efficiency of strand invasion is principally dictated by thermodynamic considerations, i.e., by the total number of base pairs that can be formed; but mismatch position-specific effects are also important. We also addressed an apparent difference between in vitro and in vivo strand exchange assays, where in vitro studies had suggested that at a single contiguous stretch of 8 consecutive bases was needed to be paired for stable strand pairing, while in vivo assays using 108-bp substrates found significant recombination even when every 6th base was mismatched. Now, using substrates of either 90 or 108 nt-the latter being the size of the in vivo templates-we find that in vitro D-loop results are very similar to the in vivo results. However, there are still notable differences between in vivo and in vitro assays that are especially evident with unevenly-distributed mismatches. Mismatches in the donor template are incorporated into the BIR product in a strongly polar fashion up to ~40 nucleotides from the 3' end. Mismatch incorporation depends on the 3'\u2192 5' proofreading exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase \u03b4, with little contribution from Msh2/Mlh1 mismatch repair proteins, or from Rad1-Rad10 flap nuclease or the Mph1 helicase. Surprisingly, the probability of a mismatch 27 nt from the 3' end being replaced by donor sequence was the same whether the preceding 26 nucleotides were mismatched every 6th base or fully homologous. These data suggest that DNA polymerase \u03b4 \"chews back\" the 3' end of the invading strand without any mismatch-dependent cues from the strand invasion structure. However, there appears to be an alternative way to incorporate a mismatch at the first base at the 3' end of the donor.",

        "Abstract": "Bloom syndrome (BS) is associated with a profoundly increased cancer risk and is caused by mutations in the Bloom helicase (BLM). BLM is involved in the nucleolytic processing of the ends of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), to yield long 3' ssDNA tails that serve as the substrate for break repair by homologous recombination (HR). Here, we use single-molecule imaging to demonstrate that BLM mediates formation of large ssDNA loops during DNA end processing. A BLM mutant lacking the N-terminal domain (NTD) retains vigorous in vitro end processing activity but fails to generate ssDNA loops. This same mutant supports DSB end processing in cells, however, these cells do not form RAD51 DNA repair foci and the processed DSBs are channeled into synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SSA) instead of HR-mediated repair, consistent with a defect in RAD51 filament formation. Together, our results provide insights into BLM functions during homologous recombination.",

        "Abstract": "Srs2 is a superfamily 1 (SF1) helicase that participates in several pathways necessary for the repair of damaged DNA. Srs2 regulates formation of early homologous recombination (HR) intermediates by actively removing the recombinase Rad51 from single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). It is not known whether and how Srs2 itself is down-regulated to allow for timely HR progression. Rad54 and Rdh54 are two closely related superfamily 2 (SF2) motor proteins that promote the formation of Rad51-dependent recombination intermediates. Rad54 and Rdh54 bind tightly to Rad51-ssDNA and act downstream of Srs2, suggesting that they may affect the ability of Srs2 to dismantle Rad51 filaments. Here, we used DNA curtains to determine whether Rad54 and Rdh54 alter the ability of Srs2 to disrupt Rad51 filaments. We show that Rad54 and Rdh54 act synergistically to greatly restrict the antirecombinase activity of Srs2. Our findings suggest that Srs2 may be accorded only a limited time window to act and that Rad54 and Rdh54 fulfill a role of prorecombinogenic licensing factors.",

        "Abstract": "Mycobacterial AdnAB is a heterodimeric helicase-nuclease that initiates homologous recombination by resecting DNA double-strand breaks. The AdnB subunit hydrolyzes ATP to drive single-nucleotide steps of 3'-to-5' translocation of AdnAB on the tracking DNA strand via a ratchet-like mechanism. Trp325 in AdnB motif III, which intercalates into the tracking strand and makes a \u03c0 stack on a nucleobase 5' of a flipped-out nucleoside, is the putative ratchet pawl without which ATP hydrolysis is mechanically futile. Here, we report that AdnAB mutants wherein Trp325 was replaced with phenylalanine, tyrosine, histidine, leucine, or alanine retained activity in ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis but displayed a gradient of effects on DSB resection. The resection velocities of Phe325 and Tyr325 mutants were 90% and 85% of the wild-type AdnAB velocity. His325 slowed resection rate to 3% of wild-type and Leu325 and Ala325 abolished DNA resection. A cryo-EM structure of the DNA-bound Ala325 mutant revealed that the AdnB motif III peptide was disordered and the erstwhile flipped out tracking strand nucleobase reverted to a continuous base-stacked arrangement with its neighbors. We conclude that \u03c0 stacking of Trp325 on a DNA nucleobase triggers and stabilizes the flipped-out conformation of the neighboring nucleoside that underlies formation of a ratchet pawl.",

        "Abstract": "DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are among some of the most deleterious forms of DNA damage. Left unrepaired, they are detrimental to genome stability, leading to high risk of cancer. Two major mechanisms are responsible for the repair of DSBs, homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). The complex nature of both pathways, involving a myriad of protein factors functioning in a highly coordinated manner at distinct stages of repair, lend themselves to detailed mechanistic studies using the latest single-molecule techniques. In avoiding ensemble averaging effects inherent to traditional biochemical or genetic methods, single-molecule studies have painted an increasingly detailed picture for every step of the DSB repair processes.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is a conserved mechanism essential for the accurate repair of DNA double stranded breaks and the exchange of genetic information during meiosis. The key steps in HR are carried out by the RecA/Rad51 class of recombinases, which form a helical filament on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and catalyze homology search and strand exchange with a complementary duplex DNA target. In eukaryotes, assembly of the Rad51-ssDNA filament requires regulatory factors called mediators, including Rad51 paralogs. A mechanistic understanding of the role of Rad51 paralogs in HR has been hampered by the transient and diverse nature of intermediates formed with the Rad51-ssDNA filament, which cannot be resolved by traditional ensemble methods. The biochemical characterization of Rad51 paralogs, including the S. cerevisiae complex Rad55-Rad57 has also been limited by their propensity to aggregate. Here we describe the preparation of monodisperse GFP-tagged Rad55-Rad57 complex and the methodology for its analysis in our single-molecule DNA curtain assay.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is a mechanism conserved from bacteria to humans essential for the accurate repair of DNA double-stranded breaks, and maintenance of genome integrity. In eukaryotes, the key DNA transactions in HR are catalyzed by the Rad51 recombinase, assisted by a host of regulatory factors including mediators such as Rad52 and Rad51 paralogs. Rad51 paralogs play a crucial role in regulating proper levels of HR, and mutations in the human counterparts have been associated with diseases such as cancer and Fanconi Anemia.

The helicase superfamily 1 (Sf1) is one of the largest subgroups of helicases and they are required for a range of cellular activities across all domains of life. Sf1 helicases can be further subdivided into two classes called the Sf1a and Sf1b helicases, which move in opposite directions on nucleic acids. The results of this movement can range from the separation of strands within duplex nucleic acids to the physical remodeling or removal of nucleoprotein complexes.

        "Abstract": "Many clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-based genome editing technologies take advantage of Cas nucleases to induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at desired locations within a genome. Further processing of the DSBs by the cellular DSB repair machinery is then necessary to introduce desired mutations, sequence insertions, or gene deletions. Thus, the accuracy and efficiency of genome editing are influenced by the cellular DSB repair pathways. DSBs are themselves highly genotoxic lesions and as such cells have evolved multiple mechanisms for their repair. These repair pathways include homologous recombination (HR), classical nonhomologous end joining (cNHEJ), microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) and single-strand annealing (SSA). In this review, we briefly highlight CRISPR-Cas9 and then describe the mechanisms of DSB repair. Finally, we summarize recent findings of factors that can influence the choice of DNA repair pathway in response to Cas9-induced DSBs.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is a highly conserved DNA repair pathway required for the accurate repair of DNA double-stranded breaks. DNA recombination is catalyzed by the RecA/Rad51 family of proteins, which are conserved from bacteria to humans. The key intermediate catalyzing DNA recombination is the presynaptic complex (PSC), which is a helical filament comprised of Rad51-bound single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Multiple cellular factors either promote or downregulate PSC activity, and a fine balance between such regulators is required for the proper regulation of HR and maintenance of genomic integrity. However, dissecting the complex mechanisms regulating PSC activity has been a challenge using traditional ensemble methods due to the transient and dynamic nature of recombination intermediates. We have developed a single-molecule assay called ssDNA curtains that allows us to visualize individual DNA intermediates in real-time, using total internal reflection microscopy (TIRFM). This assay has allowed us to study many aspects of HR regulation that involve complex and heterogenous reaction intermediates. Here we describe the procedure for a basic ssDNA curtain assay to study PSC filament dynamics, and explain how to process and analyze the resulting data.",

        "Abstract": "Mycobacterial AdnAB is a heterodimeric helicase-nuclease that initiates homologous recombination by resecting DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The N-terminal motor domain of the AdnB subunit hydrolyzes ATP to drive rapid and processive 3' to 5' translocation of AdnAB on the tracking DNA strand. ATP hydrolysis is mechanically productive when oscillating protein domain motions synchronized with the ATPase cycle propel the DNA tracking strand forward by a single-nucleotide step, in what is thought to entail a pawl-and-ratchet-like fashion. By gauging the effects of alanine mutations of the 16 amino acids at the AdnB-DNA interface on DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis, DNA translocation, and DSB resection in ensemble and single-molecule assays, we gained key insights into which DNA contacts couple ATP hydrolysis to motor activity. The results implicate AdnB Trp325, which intercalates into the tracking strand and stacks on a nucleobase, as the singular essential constituent of the ratchet pawl, without which ATP hydrolysis on ssDNA is mechanically futile. Loss of Thr663 and Thr118 contacts with tracking strand phosphates and of His665 with a nucleobase drastically slows the AdnAB motor during DSB resection. Our findings for AdnAB prompt us to analogize its mechanism to that of an automobile clutch.",

        "Abstract": "The RAD51 recombinase forms nucleoprotein filaments to promote double-strand break repair, replication fork reversal, and fork stabilization. The stability of these filaments is highly regulated, as both too little and too much RAD51 activity can cause genome instability. RADX is a single-strand DNA (ssDNA) binding protein that regulates DNA replication. Here, we define its mechanism of action. We find that RADX inhibits RAD51 strand exchange and D-loop formation activities. RADX directly and selectively interacts with ATP-bound RAD51, stimulates ATP hydrolysis, and destabilizes RAD51 nucleofilaments. The RADX interaction with RAD51, in addition to its ssDNA binding capability, is required to maintain replication fork elongation rates and fork stability. Furthermore, BRCA2 can overcome the RADX-dependent RAD51 inhibition. Thus, RADX functions in opposition to BRCA2 in regulating RAD51 nucleofilament stability to ensure the right level of RAD51 function during DNA replication.",

Rad51 paralogs fulfill a conserved but undefined role in HR, and their mutations are associated with increased cancer risk in humans. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to reveal that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 paralog complex Rad55-Rad57 promotes assembly of Rad51 recombinase filament through transient interactions, providing evidence that it acts like a classical molecular chaperone. Srs2 is an ATP-dependent anti-recombinase that downregulates HR by actively dismantling Rad51 filaments. Contrary to the current model, we find that Rad55-Rad57 does not physically block the movement of Srs2. Instead, Rad55-Rad57 promotes rapid re-assembly of Rad51 filaments after their disruption by Srs2. Our findings support a model in which Rad51 is in flux between free and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-bound states, the rate of which is controlled dynamically though the opposing actions of Rad55-Rad57 and Srs2.",

        "Abstract": "RECQ5 is one of five RecQ helicases found in humans and is thought to participate in homologous DNA recombination by acting as a negative regulator of the recombinase protein RAD51. Here, we use kinetic and single molecule imaging methods to monitor RECQ5 behavior on various nucleoprotein complexes. Our data demonstrate that RECQ5 can act as an ATP-dependent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) motor protein and can translocate on ssDNA that is bound by replication protein A (RPA). RECQ5 can also translocate on RAD51-coated ssDNA and readily dismantles RAD51-ssDNA filaments. RECQ5 interacts with RAD51 through protein-protein contacts, and disruption of this interface through a RECQ5-F666A mutation reduces translocation velocity by \u223c50%. However, RECQ5 readily removes the ATP hydrolysis-deficient mutant RAD51-K133R from ssDNA, suggesting that filament disruption is not coupled to the RAD51 ATP hydrolysis cycle. RECQ5 also readily removes RAD51-I287T, a RAD51 mutant with enhanced ssDNA-binding activity, from ssDNA. Surprisingly, RECQ5 can bind to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), but it is unable to translocate. Similarly, RECQ5 cannot dismantle RAD51-bound heteroduplex joint molecules. Our results suggest that the roles of RECQ5 in genome maintenance may be regulated in part at the level of substrate specificity.",

        "Abstract": "Rad54 and Rdh54 are closely related ATP-dependent motor proteins that participate in homologous recombination (HR). During HR, these enzymes functionally interact with the Rad51 presynaptic complex (PSC). Despite their importance, we know little about how they are organized within the PSC, or how their organization affects PSC function. Here, we use single-molecule optical microscopy and genetic analysis of chimeric protein constructs to evaluate the binding distributions of Rad54 and Rdh54 within the PSC. We find that Rad54 and Rdh54 have distinct binding sites within the PSC, which allow these proteins to act cooperatively as DNA sequences are aligned during homology search. Our data also reveal that Rad54 must bind to a specific location within the PSC, whereas Rdh54 retains its function in the repair of MMS-induced DNA damage even when recruited to the incorrect location. These findings support a model in which the relative binding sites of Rad54 and Rdh54 help to define their functions during mitotic HR.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is important for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) and stalled replication forks in all organisms. Defects in HR are closely associated with a loss of genome integrity and oncogenic transformation in human cells. HR involves coordinated actions of a complex set of proteins, many of which remain poorly understood. The key aspect of the research described here is a technology called \"DNA curtains\", a technique which allows for the assembly of aligned DNA molecules on the surface of a microfluidic sample chamber. They can then be visualized by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). DNA curtains was pioneered by our laboratory and allows for direct access to spatiotemporal information at millisecond time scales and nanometer scale resolution, which cannot be easily revealed through other methodologies. A major advantage of DNA curtains is that it simplifies the collection of statistically relevant data from single molecule experiments. This research continues to yield new insights into how cells regulate and preserve genome integrity.",

During HR, damaged DNA must be aligned with an undamaged template through a process referred to as the homology search. Despite decades of study, key aspects of this search remain undefined. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to demonstrate that Rad54, a conserved Snf2-like protein found in all eukaryotes, switches the search from the diffusion-based pathways characteristic of the basal HR machinery to an active process in which DNA sequences are aligned via an ATP-dependent molecular motor-driven mechanism. We further demonstrate that Rad54 disrupts the donor template strands, enabling the search to take place within a migrating DNA bubble-like structure that is bound by replication protein A (RPA). Our results reveal that Rad54, working together with RPA, fundamentally alters how DNA sequences are aligned during HR.",

Here, we characterize human SMC complexes condensin I and II and unveil the architecture of the human condensin II complex, revealing two putative DNA-entrapment sites. Using single-molecule imaging, we demonstrate that both condensin I and II exhibit ATP-dependent motor activity and promote extensive and reversible compaction of double-stranded DNA. Nucleosomes are incorporated into DNA loops during compaction without being displaced from the DNA, indicating that condensin complexes can readily act upon nucleosome-bound DNA molecules.

        "Abstract": "Mycobacterial AdnAB is a heterodimeric helicase-nuclease that initiates homologous recombination by resecting DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The AdnA and AdnB subunits are each composed of an N-terminal motor domain and a C-terminal nuclease domain. Here we report cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of AdnAB in three functional states: in the absence of DNA and in complex with forked duplex DNAs before and after cleavage of the 5' single-strand DNA (ssDNA) tail by the AdnA nuclease. The structures reveal the path of the 5' ssDNA through the AdnA nuclease domain and the mechanism of 5' strand cleavage; the path of the 3' tracking strand through the AdnB motor and the DNA contacts that couple ATP hydrolysis to mechanical work; the position of the AdnA iron-sulfur cluster subdomain at the Y junction and its likely role in maintaining the split trajectories of the unwound 5' and 3' strands. Single-molecule DNA curtain analysis of DSB resection reveals that AdnAB is highly processive but prone to spontaneous pausing at random sites on duplex DNA. A striking property of AdnAB is that the velocity of DSB resection slows after the enzyme experiences a spontaneous pause. Our results highlight shared as well as distinctive properties of AdnAB vis-\u00e0-vis the RecBCD and AddAB clades of bacterial DSB-resecting motor nucleases.",

        "Title": "Single-molecule visualization of human BLM helicase as it acts upon double- and single-stranded DNA substrates.",
        "Abstract": "Bloom helicase (BLM) and its orthologs are essential for the maintenance of genome integrity. BLM defects represent the underlying cause of Bloom Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that is marked by strong cancer predisposition. BLM deficient cells accumulate extensive chromosomal aberrations stemming from dysfunctions in homologous recombination (HR). BLM participates in several HR stages and helps dismantle potentially harmful HR intermediates. However, much remains to be learned about the molecular mechanisms of these BLM-mediated regulatory effects. Here, we use DNA curtains to directly visualize the activity of BLM helicase on single molecules of DNA. Our data show that BLM is a robust helicase capable of rapidly (\u223c70-80 base pairs per second) unwinding extensive tracts (\u223c8-10 kilobases) of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Importantly, we find no evidence for BLM activity on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that is bound by replication protein A (RPA). Likewise, our results show that BLM can neither associate with nor translocate on ssDNA that is bound by the recombinase protein RAD51. Moreover, our data reveal that the presence of RAD51 also blocks BLM translocation on dsDNA substrates. We discuss our findings within the context of potential regulator roles for BLM helicase during DNA replication and repair.",

        "Abstract": "Rad52 is a key factor for homologous recombination (HR) in yeast. Rad52 helps assemble Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments that catalyze DNA strand exchange, and it mediates single-strand DNA annealing. We find that Rad52 has an even earlier function in HR in restricting DNA double-stranded break ends resection that generates 3' single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails. In fission yeast, Exo1 is the primary resection nuclease, with the helicase Rqh1 playing a minor role. We demonstrate that the choice of two extensive resection pathways is regulated by Rad52. In rad52 cells, the resection rate increases from \u223c3-5 kb/h up to \u223c10-20 kb/h in an Rqh1-dependent manner, while Exo1 becomes dispensable. Budding yeast Rad52 similarly inhibits Sgs1-dependent resection. Single-molecule analysis with purified budding yeast proteins shows that Rad52 competes with Sgs1 for DNA end binding and inhibits Sgs1 translocation along DNA. These results identify a role for Rad52 in limiting ssDNA generated by end resection.",

The evolutionary origins of this two-recombinase system remain poorly understood. Interestingly, Dmc1 can stabilize mismatch-containing base triplets, whereas Rad51 cannot. Here, we demonstrate that this difference can be attributed to three amino acids conserved only within the Dmc1 lineage of the Rad51/RecA family. Chimeric Rad51 mutants harboring Dmc1-specific amino acids gain the ability to stabilize heteroduplex DNA joints with mismatch-containing base triplets, whereas Dmc1 mutants with Rad51-specific amino acids lose this ability.

        "Abstract": "DNA helicases of the RecQ family are conserved among the three domains of life and play essential roles in genome maintenance. Mutations in several human RecQ helicases lead to diseases that are marked by cancer predisposition. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RecQ helicase Sgs1 is orthologous to human BLM, defects in which cause the cancer-prone Bloom's Syndrome. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to provide a quantitative mechanistic understanding of Sgs1 activities on single stranded DNA (ssDNA), which is a central intermediate in all aspects of DNA metabolism. We show that Sgs1 acts upon ssDNA bound by either replication protein A (RPA) or the recombinase Rad51. Surprisingly, we find that Sgs1 utilizes a novel motor mechanism for disrupting ssDNA intermediates bound by the recombinase protein Rad51. The ability of Sgs1 to disrupt Rad51-ssDNA filaments may explain some of the defects engendered by RECQ helicase deficiencies in human cells.",

In general, all helicases function by converting the chemical energy stored in the bond between the gamma and beta phosphates of adenosine triphosphate into mechanical work, which results in the unidirectional movement of the helicase protein along one strand of a nucleic acid. The results of this translocation activity can range from separation of strands within duplex nucleic acids to the physical remodeling or removal of nucleoprotein complexes.

        "Abstract": "In the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination, the DNA break ends must first be processed into 3' single-strand DNA overhangs. In budding yeast, end processing requires the helicase Sgs1 (BLM in humans), the nuclease/helicase Dna2, Top3-Rmi1, and replication protein A (RPA). Here, we use single-molecule imaging to visualize Sgs1-dependent end processing in real-time. We show that Sgs1 is recruited to DNA ends through Top3-Rmi1-dependent or -independent means, and in both cases Sgs1 is maintained in an immoble state at the DNA ends. Importantly, the addition of Dna2 triggers processive Sgs1 translocation, but DNA resection only occurs when RPA is also present. We also demonstrate that the Sgs1-Dna2-Top3-Rmi1-RPA ensemble can efficiently disrupt nucleosomes, and that Sgs1 itself possesses nucleosome remodeling activity. Together, these results shed light on the regulatory interplay among conserved protein factors that mediate the nucleolytic processing of DNA ends in preparation for homologous recombination-mediated chromosome damage repair.",

A central component of the meiotic program is the formation and repair of programmed double strand breaks. Recombination-driven repair of these meiotic breaks differs from recombination during mitosis in that meiotic breaks are preferentially repaired using the homologous chromosomes in a process known as homolog bias. Homolog bias allows for physical interactions between homologous chromosomes that are required for proper chromosome segregation, and the formation of crossover products ensuring genetic diversity in progeny.

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is a universally conserved DNA repair pathway that can result in the exchange of genetic material. In eukaryotes, HR has evolved into an essential step in meiosis. During meiosis many eukaryotes utilize a two-recombinase pathway. This system consists of Rad51 and the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1. Both recombinases have distinct activities during meiotic HR, despite being highly similar in sequence and having closely related biochemical activities, raising the question of how these two proteins can perform separate functions. A likely explanation for their differential regulation involves the meiosis-specific recombination proteins Hop2 and Mnd1, which are part of a highly conserved eukaryotic protein complex that participates in HR, albeit through poorly understood mechanisms. To better understand how Hop2-Mnd1 functions during HR, here we used DNA curtains in conjunction with single-molecule imaging to measure and quantify the binding of the Hop2-Mnd1 complex from ",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is a universally conserved mechanism used to maintain genomic integrity. In eukaryotes, HR is used to repair the spontaneous double strand breaks (DSBs) that arise during mitotic growth, and the programmed DSBs that form during meiosis. The mechanisms that govern mitotic and meiotic HR share many similarities, however, there are also several key differences, which reflect the unique attributes of each process. For instance, even though many of the proteins involved in mitotic and meiotic HR are the same, DNA target specificity is not: mitotic DSBs are repaired primarily using the sister chromatid as a template, whereas meiotic DBSs are repaired primarily through targeting of the homologous chromosome. These changes in template specificity are induced by expression of meiosis-specific HR proteins, down-regulation of mitotic HR proteins, and the formation of meiosis-specific chromosomal structures. Here, we compare and contrast the biochemical properties of key recombination intermediates formed during the pre-synapsis phase of mitotic and meiotic HR. Throughout, we try to highlight unanswered questions that will shape our understanding of how homologous recombination contributes to human cancer biology and sexual reproduction.",

        "Abstract": "Helicases are crucial participants in many types of DNA repair reactions, including homologous recombination. The properties of these enzymes can be assayed by traditional bulk biochemical analysis; however, these types of assays cannot directly access some types of information. In particular, bulk biochemical assays cannot readily access information that may be obscured in population averages. Single-molecule assays offer the potential advantage of being able to visualize the molecules in question in real time, thus providing direct access to questions relating to translocation velocity, processivity, and insights into how helicases may behave on different types of substrates. Here, we describe the use of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) curtains as an assay for directly viewing the behavior of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Srs2 helicase on single molecules of ssDNA. When used with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, these methods can be used to track the binding and movements of individual helicase complexes, and allow new insights into helicase behaviors at the single-molecule level.",

        "Abstract": "Most eukaryotes have two Rad51/RecA family recombinases, Rad51, which promotes recombination during mitotic double-strand break (DSB) repair, and the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1. During meiosis, the strand exchange activity of Rad51 is downregulated through interactions with the meiosis-specific protein Hed1, which helps ensure that strand exchange is driven by Dmc1 instead of Rad51. Hed1 acts by preventing Rad51 from interacting with Rad54, a cofactor required for promoting strand exchange during homologous recombination. However, we have a poor quantitative understanding of the regulatory interplay between these proteins. Here, we use real-time single-molecule imaging to probe how the Hed1- and Rad54-mediated regulatory network contributes to the identity of mitotic and meiotic presynaptic complexes. Based on our findings, we define a model in which kinetic competition between Hed1 and Rad54 helps define the functional identity of the presynaptic complex as cells undergo the transition from mitotic to meiotic repair.",

        "Abstract": "During meiosis, the two DNA recombinases Rad51 and Dmc1 form specialized presynaptic filaments that are adapted for performing recombination between homologous chromosomes. There is currently a limited understanding of how these two recombinases are organized within the meiotic presynaptic filament. Here, we used single molecule imaging to examine the properties of presynaptic complexes composed of both Rad51 and Dmc1. We demonstrate that Rad51 and Dmc1 have an intrinsic ability to self-segregate, even in the absence of any other recombination accessory proteins. Moreover, we found that the presence of Dmc1 stabilizes the adjacent Rad51 filaments, suggesting that cross-talk between these two recombinases may affect their biochemical properties. Based upon these findings, we describe a model for the organization of Rad51 and Dmc1 within the meiotic presynaptic complex, which is also consistent with ",

Here, we visualize Srs2 as it acts upon single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) bound by the Rad51 recombinase. We demonstrate that Srs2 is a processive translocase capable of stripping thousands of Rad51 molecules from ssDNA at a rate of \u223c50 monomers/s. We show that Srs2 is recruited to RPA clusters embedded between Rad51 filaments and that multimeric arrays of Srs2 assemble during translocation on ssDNA through a mechanism involving iterative Srs2 loading events at sites cleared of Rad51. We also demonstrate that Srs2 acts on heteroduplex DNA joints through two alternative pathways, both of which result in rapid disruption of the heteroduplex intermediate. On the basis of these findings, we present a model describing the recruitment and regulation of Srs2 as it acts upon homologous recombination intermediates.",

Our understanding of homologous recombination is built upon more than a century of scientific inquiry, but achieving a more complete picture using ensemble biochemical and genetic approaches is hampered by population heterogeneity and transient recombination intermediates. Recent advances in single-molecule and super-resolution microscopy methods help to overcome these limitations and have led to new and refined insights into recombination mechanisms, including a detailed understanding of DNA helicase function and synaptonemal complex structure. The ability to view cellular processes at single-molecule resolution promises to transform our understanding of recombination and related processes.",

        "Abstract": "Srs2 is a super-family 1 helicase that promotes genome stability by dismantling toxic DNA recombination intermediates. However, the mechanisms by\u00a0which Srs2 remodels or resolves recombination\u00a0intermediates remain poorly understood. Here, single-molecule imaging is used to visualize Srs2 in real time as it acts on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) bound by protein factors that function in recombination. We demonstrate that Srs2 is highly processive and translocates rapidly (\u223c170 nt per second) in the 3'\u21925' direction along ssDNA saturated with replication protein A (RPA). We show that RPA is evicted from DNA during the passage of Srs2. Remarkably, Srs2 also readily removes the recombination mediator Rad52 from RPA-ssDNA and, in doing so, promotes rapid redistribution of both Rad52 and RPA. These findings have important mechanistic implications for understanding how Srs2 and related nucleic acid motor proteins resolve potentially pathogenic nucleoprotein intermediates.",

        "Abstract": "The tumour suppressor complex BRCA1-BARD1 functions in the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks by homologous recombination. During this process, BRCA1-BARD1 facilitates the nucleolytic resection of DNA ends to generate a single-stranded template for the recruitment of another tumour suppressor complex, BRCA2-PALB2, and the recombinase RAD51. Here, by examining purified wild-type and mutant BRCA1-BARD1, we show that both BRCA1 and BARD1 bind DNA and interact with RAD51, and that BRCA1-BARD1 enhances the recombinase activity of RAD51. Mechanistically, BRCA1-BARD1 promotes the assembly of the synaptic complex, an essential intermediate in RAD51-mediated DNA joint formation. We provide evidence that BRCA1 and BARD1 are indispensable for RAD51 stimulation. Notably, BRCA1-BARD1 mutants with weakened RAD51 interactions show compromised DNA joint formation and impaired mediation of homologous recombination and DNA repair in cells. Our results identify a late role of BRCA1-BARD1 in homologous recombination, an attribute of the tumour suppressor complex that could be targeted in cancer therapy.",

        "Abstract": "An essential coordinator of all DNA metabolic processes is Replication Protein A (RPA). RPA orchestrates these processes by binding to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and interacting with several other DNA binding proteins. Determining the real-time kinetics of single players such as RPA in the presence of multiple DNA processors to better understand the associated mechanistic events is technically challenging. To overcome this hurdle, we utilized non-canonical amino acids and bio-orthogonal chemistry to site-specifically incorporate a chemical fluorophore onto a single subunit of heterotrimeric RPA. Upon binding to ssDNA, this fluorescent RPA (RPAf) generates a quantifiable change in fluorescence, thus serving as a reporter of its dynamics on DNA in the presence of multiple other DNA binding proteins. Using RPAf, we describe the kinetics of facilitated self-exchange and exchange by Rad51 and mediator proteins during various stages in homologous recombination. RPAf is widely applicable to investigate its mechanism of action in processes such as DNA replication, repair and telomere maintenance.",

        "Abstract": "In physiological settings, all nucleic acids motor proteins must travel along substrates that are crowded with other proteins. However, the physical basis for how motor proteins behave in these highly crowded environments remains unknown. Here, we use real-time single-molecule imaging to determine how the ATP-dependent translocase RecBCD travels along DNA occupied by tandem arrays of high-affinity DNA binding proteins. We show that RecBCD forces each protein into its nearest adjacent neighbor, causing rapid disruption of the protein-nucleic acid interaction. This mechanism is not the same way that RecBCD disrupts isolated nucleoprotein complexes on otherwise naked DNA. Instead, molecular crowding itself completely alters the mechanism by which RecBCD removes tightly bound protein obstacles from DNA.",

        "Abstract": "Rad52 is a highly conserved protein involved in the repair of DNA damage. Human RAD52 has been shown to mediate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and is synthetic lethal with mutations in other key recombination proteins. For this study, we used single-molecule imaging and ssDNA curtains to examine the binding interactions of human RAD52 with replication protein A (RPA)-coated ssDNA, and we monitored the fate of RAD52 during assembly of the presynaptic complex. We show that RAD52 binds tightly to the RPA-ssDNA complex and imparts an inhibitory effect on RPA turnover. We also found that during presynaptic complex assembly, most of the RPA and RAD52 was displaced from the ssDNA, but some RAD52-RPA-ssDNA complexes persisted as interspersed clusters surrounded by RAD51 filaments. Once assembled, the presence of RAD51 restricted formation of new RAD52-binding events, but additional RAD52 could bind once RAD51 dissociated from the ssDNA. Together, these results provide new insights into the behavior and dynamics of human RAD52 during presynaptic complex assembly and disassembly.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination plays key roles in double-strand break repair, rescue, and repair of stalled replication forks and meiosis. The broadly conserved Rad51/RecA family of recombinases catalyzes the DNA strand invasion reaction that takes place during homologous recombination. We have established single-stranded (ss)DNA curtain assays for measuring individual base triplet steps during the early stages of strand invasion. Here, we examined how base triplet stepping by RecA, Rad51, and Dmc1 is affected by DNA sequence imperfections, such as single and multiple mismatches, abasic sites, and single nucleotide insertions. Our work reveals features of base triplet stepping that are conserved among these three phylogenetic lineages of the Rad51/RecA family and also reveals lineage-specific behaviors reflecting properties that are unique to each recombinase. These findings suggest that Dmc1 is tolerant of single mismatches, multiple mismatches, and even abasic sites, whereas RecA and Rad51 are not. Interestingly, the presence of single nucleotide insertion abolishes recognition of an adjacent base triplet by all three recombinases. On the basis of these findings, we describe models for how sequence imperfections may affect base triplet recognition by Rad51/RecA family members, and we discuss how these models and our results may relate to the different biological roles of RecA, Rad51, and Dmc1.",

        "Abstract": "Shelterin is a six-subunit protein complex that plays crucial roles in telomere length regulation, protection, and maintenance. Although several shelterin subunits have been studied in\u00a0vitro, the biochemical properties of the fully assembled shelterin complex are not well defined. Here, we characterize shelterin using ensemble biochemical methods, electron microscopy, and single-molecule imaging to determine how shelterin recognizes and assembles onto telomeric repeats. We show that shelterin complexes can exist in solution and primarily locate telomeric DNA through a three-dimensional diffusive search. Shelterin can diffuse along non-telomeric DNA but is impeded by nucleosomes, arguing against extensive one-dimensional diffusion as a viable assembly mechanism. Our work supports a model in which individual shelterin complexes rapidly bind to telomeric repeats as independent functional units, which do not alter the DNA-binding mode of neighboring complexes but, rather, occupy telomeric DNA in a \"beads on a string\" configuration.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is a crucial pathway for double-stranded DNA break (DSB) repair. During the early stages of HR, the newly generated DSB ends are processed to yield long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhangs, which are quickly bound by replication protein A (RPA). RPA is then replaced by the DNA recombinase Rad51, which forms extended helical filaments on the ssDNA. The resulting nucleoprotein filament, known as the presynaptic complex, is responsible for pairing the ssDNA with homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which serves as the template to guide DSB repair. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to visualize the interplay between human RPA (hRPA) and human RAD51 during presynaptic complex assembly and disassembly. We demonstrate that ssDNA-bound hRPA can undergo facilitated exchange, enabling hRPA to undergo rapid exchange between free and ssDNA-bound states only when free hRPA is present in solution. Our results also indicate that the presence of free hRPA inhibits RAD51 filament nucleation, but has a lesser impact upon filament elongation. This finding suggests that hRPA exerts important regulatory influence over RAD51 and may in turn affect the properties of the assembled RAD51 filament. These experiments provide an important basis for further investigations into the regulation of human presynaptic complex assembly.",

        "Abstract": "Central to homologous recombination in eukaryotes is the RAD51 recombinase, which forms helical nucleoprotein filaments on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and catalyzes strand invasion with homologous duplex DNA. Various regulatory proteins assist this reaction including the RAD51 paralogs. We recently discovered that a RAD51 paralog complex from C.\u00a0elegans, RFS-1/RIP-1, functions predominantly downstream of filament assembly by binding and remodeling RAD-51-ssDNA filaments to a conformation more proficient for strand exchange. Here, we demonstrate that RFS-1/RIP-1 acts by shutting down RAD-51 dissociation from ssDNA. Using stopped-flow experiments, we show that RFS-1/RIP-1 confers this dramatic stabilization by capping the 5' end of RAD-51-ssDNA filaments. Filament end capping propagates a stabilizing effect with a 5'\u21923' polarity approximately 40 nucleotides along individual filaments. Finally, we discover that filament capping and stabilization are dependent on nucleotide binding, but not hydrolysis by RFS-1/RIP-1. These data define the mechanism of RAD51 filament remodeling by RAD51 paralogs.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination is an important DNA repair pathway that plays key roles in maintaining genome stability. Escherichia coli RecA is an ATP-dependent DNA-binding protein that catalyzes the DNA strand exchange reactions in homologous recombination. RecA assembles into long helical filaments on single-stranded DNA, and these presynaptic complexes are responsible for locating and pairing with a homologous duplex DNA. Recent single molecule studies have provided new insights into RecA behavior, but the potential influence of ATP in the reactions remains poorly understood. Here we examine how ATP influences the ability of the RecA presynaptic complex to interact with homologous dsDNA. We demonstrate that over short time regimes, RecA presynaptic complexes sample heterologous dsDNA similarly in the presence of either ATP or ATP\u03b3S, suggesting that initial interactions do not depend on ATP hydrolysis. In addition, RecA stabilizes pairing intermediates in three-base steps, and stepping energetics is seemingly unaltered in the presence of ATP. However, the overall dissociation rate of these paired intermediates with ATP is \u223c4-fold higher than with ATP\u03b3S. These experiments suggest that ATP plays an unanticipated role in promoting the turnover of captured duplex DNA intermediates as RecA attempts to align homologous sequences during the early stages of recombination.",

        "Abstract": "Histone modifications can redistribute along the genome in a sequence-independent manner, giving rise to chromatin position effects and epigenetic memory. The underlying mechanisms shape the endogenous chromatin landscape and determine its response to ectopically targeted histone modifiers. Here, we simulate linear and looping-driven spreading of histone modifications and compare both models to recent experiments on histone methylation in fission yeast. We find that a generalized nucleation-and-looping mechanism describes key observations on engineered and endogenous methylation domains including intrinsic spatial confinement, independent regulation of domain size and memory, variegation in the absence of antagonists, and coexistence of short- and long-term memory at loci with weak and strong constitutive nucleation. These findings support a straightforward relationship between the biochemical properties of chromatin modifiers and the spatiotemporal modification pattern. The proposed mechanism gives rise to a phase diagram for cellular memory that may be generally applicable to explain epigenetic phenomena across different species.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination allows for the regulated exchange of genetic information between two different DNA molecules of identical or nearly identical sequence composition, and is a major pathway for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. A key facet of homologous recombination is the ability of recombination proteins to perfectly align the damaged DNA with homologous sequence located elsewhere in the genome. This reaction is referred to as the homology search and is akin to the target searches conducted by many different DNA-binding proteins. Here I briefly highlight early investigations into the homology search mechanism, and then describe more recent research. Based on these studies, I summarize a model that includes a combination of intersegmental transfer, short-distance one-dimensional sliding, and length-specific microhomology recognition to efficiently align DNA sequences during the homology search. I also suggest some future directions to help further our understanding of the homology search. Where appropriate, I direct the reader to other recent reviews describing various issues related to homologous recombination.",

        "Abstract": "Cohesin is essential for the hierarchical organization of the eukaryotic genome and plays key roles in many aspects of chromosome biology. The conformation of cohesin bound to DNA remains poorly defined, leaving crucial gaps in our understanding of how cohesin fulfills its biological functions. Here, we use single-molecule microscopy to directly observe the dynamic and functional characteristics of cohesin bound to DNA. We show that cohesin can undergo rapid one-dimensional (1D) diffusion along DNA, but individual nucleosomes, nucleosome arrays, and other protein obstacles significantly restrict its mobility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DNA motor proteins can readily push cohesin along DNA, but they cannot pass through the interior of the cohesin ring. Together, our results reveal that DNA-bound cohesin has a central pore that is substantially smaller than anticipated. These findings have direct implications for understanding how cohesin and other SMC proteins interact with and distribute along chromatin.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is a critical cellular process for repairing double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) - a toxic type of DNA lesion that can result in chromosomal rearrangements and cancer. During the early stages of HR, members from the Rad51/RecA family of recombinases assemble into long filaments on the single-stranded DNA overhangs that are present at processed DSBs. These nucleoprotein filaments are referred to as presynaptic complexes, and these presynaptic complexes must align and pair homologous DNA sequences during HR. Traditional ensemble methods cannot easily access the transient and often heterogeneous intermediates that are typical of DNA recombination reactions, and as a consequence, there remain many open questions with respect to the molecular details of this pathway. Novel single-molecule approaches that are capable of directly visualizing reaction intermediates in solution and in real time offer the potential for new insights into the mechanism of homologous DNA recombination. Here we highlight recently developed single stranded DNA curtain methods for studying the properties of individual Rad51 presynaptic complexes and other related recombination intermediates at the single-molecule level.",

In Escherichia coli, Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense) is an RNA-guided surveillance complex that binds foreign DNA and recruits Cas3, a trans-acting nuclease helicase for target degradation. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to visualize Cascade and Cas3 binding to foreign DNA targets. Our analysis reveals two distinct pathways dictated by the presence or absence of a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). Binding to a protospacer flanked by a PAM recruits a nuclease-active Cas3 for degradation of short single-stranded regions of target DNA, whereas PAM mutations elicit an alternative pathway that recruits a nuclease-inactive Cas3 through a mechanism that is dependent on the Cas1 and Cas2 proteins. These findings explain how target recognition by Cascade can elicit distinct outcomes and support a model for acquisition of new spacer sequences through a mechanism involving processive, ATP-dependent Cas3 translocation along foreign DNA.",

        "Abstract": "DNA strand exchange plays a central role in genetic recombination across all kingdoms of life, but the physical basis for these reactions remains poorly defined. Using single-molecule imaging, we found that bacterial RecA and eukaryotic Rad51 and Dmc1 all stabilize strand exchange intermediates in precise three-nucleotide steps. Each step coincides with an energetic signature (0.3 kBT) that is conserved from bacteria to humans. Triplet recognition is strictly dependent on correct Watson-Crick pairing. Rad51, RecA, and Dmc1 can all step over mismatches, but only Dmc1 can stabilize mismatched triplets. This finding provides insight into why eukaryotes have evolved a meiosis-specific recombinase. We propose that canonical Watson-Crick base triplets serve as the fundamental unit of pairing interactions during DNA recombination.",

        "Abstract": "Eukaryotic replication initiation is highly regulated and dynamic. It begins with the origin recognition complex (ORC) binding DNA sites called origins of replication. ORC, together with Cdc6 and Cdt1, mediate pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) assembly by loading a double hexamer of Mcm2-7: the core of the replicative helicase. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to directly visualize Saccharomyces cerevisiae pre-RC assembly and replisome firing in real time. We show that ORC can locate and stably bind origins within large tracts of non-origin DNA and that Cdc6 drives ordered pre-RC assembly. We further show that the dynamics of the ORC-Cdc6 interaction dictate Mcm2-7 loading specificity and that Mcm2-7 double hexamers form preferentially at a native origin sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that single Mcm2-7 hexamers propagate bidirectionally, monotonically, and processively as constituents of active replisomes.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) mediates the exchange of genetic information between sister or homologous chromatids. During HR, members of the RecA/Rad51 family of recombinases must somehow search through vast quantities of DNA sequence to align and pair single-strand DNA (ssDNA) with a homologous double-strand DNA (dsDNA) template. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to visualize Rad51 as it aligns and pairs homologous DNA sequences in real time. We show that Rad51 uses a length-based recognition mechanism while interrogating dsDNA, enabling robust kinetic selection of 8-nucleotide (nt) tracts of microhomology, which kinetically confines the search to sites with a high probability of being a homologous target. Successful pairing with a ninth nucleotide coincides with an additional reduction in binding free energy, and subsequent strand exchange occurs in precise 3-nt steps, reflecting the base triplet organization of the presynaptic complex. These findings provide crucial new insights into the physical and evolutionary underpinnings of DNA recombination.",

Here we use single-molecule imaging to reveal the interplay between Saccharomyces cerevisiae RPA, Rad52 and Rad51 during presynaptic-complex assembly. We show that Rad52 binds RPA-ssDNA and suppresses RPA turnover, highlighting an unanticipated regulatory influence on protein dynamics. Rad51 binding extends the ssDNA, and Rad52-RPA clusters remain interspersed along the presynaptic complex. These clusters promote additional binding of RPA and Rad52. Our work illustrates the spatial and temporal progression of the association of RPA and Rad52 with the presynaptic complex and reveals a new RPA-Rad52-Rad51-ssDNA intermediate, with implications for how the activities of Rad52 and RPA are coordinated with Rad51 during the later stages of recombination.",

A complete understanding of these types of biological processes requires tackling questions with a range of different techniques, such as genetics, cell biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and structural biology. Here, we describe a novel experimental approach called \"DNA curtains\" that can be used to complement and extend these more traditional techniques by providing real-time information about protein-nucleic acid interactions at the level of single molecules. We describe general features of the DNA curtain technology and its application to the study of protein-nucleic acid interactions in vitro. We also discuss some future developments that will help address crucial challenges to the field of single-molecule biology.",

        "Abstract": "In physiological settings, DNA translocases will encounter DNA-bound proteins, which must be dislodged or bypassed to allow continued translocation. FtsK is a bacterial translocase that promotes chromosome dimer resolution and decatenation by activating XerCD-dif recombination. To better understand how translocases act in crowded environments, we used single-molecule imaging to visualize FtsK in real time as it collided with other proteins. We show that FtsK can push, evict, and even bypass DNA-bound proteins. The primary factor dictating the outcome of collisions was the relative affinity of the proteins for their specific binding sites. Importantly, protein-protein interactions between FtsK and XerD help prevent removal of XerCD from DNA by promoting rapid reversal of FtsK. Finally, we demonstrate that RecBCD always overwhelms FtsK when these two motor proteins collide while traveling along the same DNA molecule, indicating that RecBCD is capable of exerting a much greater force than FtsK when translocating along DNA.",

        "Abstract": "Microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is a Ku- and ligase IV-independent mechanism for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks that contributes to chromosome rearrangements. Here we used a chromosomal end-joining assay to determine the genetic requirements for MMEJ in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that end resection influences the ability to expose microhomologies; however, it is not rate limiting for MMEJ in wild-type cells. The frequency of MMEJ increased by up to 350-fold in rfa1 hypomorphic mutants, suggesting that replication protein A (RPA) bound to the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhangs formed by resection prevents spontaneous annealing between microhomologies. In vitro, the mutant RPA complexes were unable to fully extend ssDNA and were compromised in their ability to prevent spontaneous annealing. We propose that the helix-destabilizing activity of RPA channels ssDNA intermediates from mutagenic MMEJ to error-free homologous recombination, thus preserving genome integrity.",

        "Title": "Visualizing protein movement on DNA at the single-molecule level using DNA curtains.",
        "Abstract": "A fundamental feature of many nucleic-acid binding proteins is their ability to move along DNA either by diffusion-based mechanisms or by ATP-hydrolysis driven translocation. For example, most site-specific DNA-binding proteins must diffuse to some extent along DNA to either find their target sites, or to otherwise fulfill their biological roles. Similarly, nucleic-acid translocases such as helicases and polymerases must move along DNA to fulfill their functions. In both instances, the proteins must also be capable of moving in crowded environments while navigating through DNA-bound obstacles. These types of behaviors can be challenging to analyze by bulk biochemical methods because of the transient nature of the interactions, and/or heterogeneity of the reaction intermediates. The advent of single-molecule methodologies has overcome some of these problems, and has led to many new insights into the mechanisms that contribute to protein motion along DNA. We have developed DNA curtains as a tool to facilitate single molecule observations of protein-nucleic acid interactions, and we have applied these new research tools to systems involving both diffusive-based motion as well as ATP directed translocation. Here we highlight these studies by first discussing how diffusion contributes to target searches by proteins involved in post-replicative mismatch repair. We then discuss DNA curtain assays of two different DNA translocases, RecBCD and FtsK, which participate in homologous DNA recombination and site-specific DNA recombination, respectively.",

        "Title": "Concentration-dependent exchange of replication protein A on single-stranded DNA revealed by single-molecule imaging.",
        "Abstract": "Replication protein A (RPA) is a ubiquitous eukaryotic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein necessary for all aspects of DNA metabolism involving an ssDNA intermediate, including DNA replication, repair, recombination, DNA damage response and checkpoint activation, and telomere maintenance. The role of RPA in most of these reactions is to protect the ssDNA until it can be delivered to downstream enzymes. Therefore a crucial feature of RPA is that it must bind very tightly to ssDNA, but must also be easily displaced from ssDNA to allow other proteins to gain access to the substrate. Here we use total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and nanofabricated DNA curtains to visualize the behavior of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RPA on individual strands of ssDNA in real-time. Our results show that RPA remains bound to ssDNA for long periods of time when free protein is absent from solution. In contrast, RPA rapidly dissociates from ssDNA when free RPA is present in solution allowing rapid exchange between the free and bound states. In addition, the S. cerevisiae DNA recombinase Rad51 and E. coli single-stranded binding protein (SSB) also promote removal of RPA from ssDNA. These results reveal an unanticipated exchange between bound and free RPA suggesting a binding mechanism that can confer exceptionally slow off rates, yet also enables rapid displacement through a direct exchange mechanism that is reliant upon the presence of free ssDNA-binding proteins in solution. Our results indicate that RPA undergoes constant microscopic dissociation under all conditions, but this is only manifested as macroscopic dissociation (i.e. exchange) when free proteins are present in solution, and this effect is due to mass action. We propose that the dissociation of RPA from ssDNA involves a partially dissociated intermediate, which exposes a small section of ssDNA allowing other proteins to access to the DNA.",

Cas9-guide RNA complexes are also effective genome engineering agents in animals and plants. Here we use single-molecule and bulk biochemical experiments to determine how Cas9-RNA interrogates DNA to find specific cleavage sites. We show that both binding and cleavage of DNA by Cas9-RNA require recognition of a short trinucleotide protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Non-target DNA binding affinity scales with PAM density, and sequences fully complementary to the guide RNA but lacking a nearby PAM are ignored by Cas9-RNA. Competition assays provide evidence that DNA strand separation and RNA-DNA heteroduplex formation initiate at the PAM and proceed directionally towards the distal end of the target sequence. Furthermore, PAM interactions trigger Cas9 catalytic activity. These results reveal how Cas9 uses PAM recognition to quickly identify potential target sites while scanning large DNA molecules, and to regulate scission of double-stranded DNA.",

In vivo, these structures are exposed to tension, but the effect of tension on these processes was unknown. Here we used single-molecule imaging to investigate the effects of tension on actin polymerization mediated by yeast formin Bni1p. Small forces on the filaments dramatically slowed formin-mediated polymerization in the absence of profilin, but resulted in faster polymerization in the presence of profilin. We propose that force shifts the conformational equilibrium of the end of a filament associated with formin homology 2 domains toward the closed state that precludes polymerization, but that profilin-actin associated with formin homology 1 domains reverses this effect. Thus, physical forces strongly influence actin assembly by formin Bni1p.",

These processes must all take place on chromosomes that are occupied by a large number of other proteins. However, very little is known regarding how nucleic acid motor proteins move along the crowded DNA substrates that are likely to exist in physiological settings. This review summarizes recent progress in understanding how DNA-binding motor proteins respond to the presence of other proteins that lie in their paths. We highlight recent single-molecule biophysical experiments aimed at addressing this question, with an emphasis placed on analyzing the single-molecule, ensemble biochemical, and in vivo data from a mechanistic perspective.",

        "Abstract": "Single-molecule biology has matured in recent years, driven to greater sophistication by the development of increasingly advanced experimental techniques. A progressive appreciation for its unique strengths is attracting research that spans an exceptionally broad swath of physiological phenomena--from the function of nucleosomes to protein diffusion in the cell membrane. Newfound enthusiasm notwithstanding, the single-molecule approach is limited to an intrinsically defined set of biological questions; such limitation applies to all experimental approaches, and an explicit statement of the boundaries delineating each set offers a guide to most fruitfully orienting in vitro single-molecule research in the future. Here, we briefly describe a simple conceptual framework to categorize how submolecular, molecular and intracellular processes are studied. We highlight the domain of single-molecule biology in this scheme, with an emphasis on its ability to probe various forms of heterogeneity inherent to populations of discrete biological macromolecules. We then give a general overview of our high-throughput DNA curtain methodology for studying protein-nucleic acid interactions, and by contextualizing it within this framework, we explore what might be the most enticing avenues of future research. We anticipate that a focus on single-molecule biology's unique strengths will suggest a new generation of experiments with greater complexity and more immediately translatable physiological relevance.",

        "Abstract": "Gene expression, DNA replication and genome maintenance are all initiated by proteins that must recognize specific targets from among a vast excess of nonspecific DNA. For example, to initiate transcription, Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) must locate promoter sequences, which compose <2% of the bacterial genome. This search problem remains one of the least understood aspects of gene expression, largely owing to the transient nature of search intermediates. Here we visualize RNAP in real time as it searches for promoters, and we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing target searches at the submicroscopic scale on the basis of single-molecule target-association rates. We demonstrate that, contrary to long-held assumptions, the promoter search is dominated by three-dimensional diffusion at both the microscopic and submicroscopic scales in vitro, which has direct implications for understanding how promoters are located within physiological settings.",

        "Abstract": "The ability of proteins to locate specific targets among a vast excess of nonspecific DNA is a fundamental theme in biology. Basic principles governing these search mechanisms remain poorly understood, and no study has provided direct visualization of single proteins searching for and engaging target sites. Here we use the postreplicative mismatch repair proteins MutS\u03b1 and MutL\u03b1 as model systems for understanding diffusion-based target searches. Using single-molecule microscopy, we directly visualize MutS\u03b1 as it searches for DNA lesions, MutL\u03b1 as it searches for lesion-bound MutS\u03b1, and the MutS\u03b1/MutL\u03b1 complex as it scans the flanking DNA. We also show that MutL\u03b1 undergoes intersite transfer between juxtaposed DNA segments while searching for lesion-bound MutS\u03b1, but this activity is suppressed upon association with MutS\u03b1, ensuring that MutS/MutL remains associated with the damage-bearing strand while scanning the flanking DNA. Our findings highlight a hierarchy of lesion- and ATP-dependent transitions involving both MutS\u03b1 and MutL\u03b1, and help establish how different modes of diffusion can be used during recognition and repair of damaged DNA.",

Here we determine the forces required to remove the individual lipid-anchored DNA molecules from the bilayer. We demonstrate that DNA anchored to the bilayer through a single biotin-streptavidin linkage withstands \u223c20pN before being pulled free from the bilayer, whereas molecules anchored to the bilayer through multiple attachment points can withstand \u2a7e65pN; access to this higher force regime is sufficient to probe the responses of protein-DNA interactions to force changes. As a proof-of-principle, we concurrently visualized DNA-bound fluorescently-tagged RNA polymerase while simultaneously stretching the DNA molecules. This work presents a step towards a powerful experimental platform that will enable concurrent visualization of DNA curtains while applying defined forces through optical tweezers.",

        "Title": "The unstructured linker arms of Mlh1-Pms1 are important for interactions with DNA during mismatch repair.",
        "Abstract": "DNA mismatch repair (MMR) models have proposed that MSH (MutS homolog) proteins identify DNA polymerase errors while interacting with the DNA replication fork. MLH (MutL homolog) proteins (primarily Mlh1-Pms1 in baker's yeast) then survey the genome for lesion-bound MSH proteins. The resulting MSH-MLH complex formed at a DNA lesion initiates downstream steps in repair. MLH proteins act as dimers and contain long (20-30 nm) unstructured arms that connect two terminal globular domains. These arms can vary between 100 and 300 amino acids in length, are highly divergent between organisms, and are resistant to amino acid substitutions. To test the roles of the linker arms in MMR, we engineered a protease cleavage site into the Mlh1 linker arm domain of baker's yeast Mlh1-Pms1. Cleavage of the Mlh1 linker arm in vitro resulted in a defect in Mlh1-Pms1 DNA binding activity, and in vivo proteolytic cleavage resulted in a complete defect in MMR. We then generated a series of truncation mutants bearing Mlh1 and Pms1 linker arms of varying lengths. This work revealed that MMR is greatly compromised when portions of the Mlh1 linker are removed, whereas repair is less sensitive to truncation of the Pms1 linker arm. Purified complexes containing truncations in Mlh1 and Pms1 linker arms were analyzed and found to have differential defects in DNA binding that also correlated with the ability to form a ternary complex with Msh2-Msh6 and mismatch DNA. These observations are consistent with the unstructured linker domains of MLH proteins providing distinct interactions with DNA during MMR.",

        "Abstract": "FtsK is a hexameric DNA translocase that participates in the final stages of bacterial chromosome segregation. Here we investigate the DNA-binding and translocation activities of FtsK in real time by imaging fluorescently tagged proteins on nanofabricated curtains of DNA. We show that FtsK preferentially loads at 8-bp KOPS (FtsK Orienting Polar Sequences) sites and that loading is enhanced in the presence of ADP. We also demonstrate that FtsK locates KOPS through a mechanism that does not involve extensive 1D diffusion at the scale of our resolution. Upon addition of ATP, KOPS-bound FtsK translocates in the direction dictated by KOPS polarity, and once FtsK has begun translocating it does not rerecognize KOPS from either direction. However, FtsK can abruptly change directions while translocating along DNA independent of KOPS, suggesting that the ability to reorient on DNA does not arise from DNA sequence-specific effects. Taken together, our data support a model in which FtsK locates KOPS through random collisions, preferentially engages KOPS in the ADP-bound state, translocates in the direction dictated by the polar orientation of KOPS, and is incapable of recognizing KOPS while translocating along DNA.",

The presence of nucleosomes and the resulting organization of the genome into higher-order chromatin structures has profound consequences for virtually all aspects of DNA metabolism, including DNA transcription, repair, and chromosome segregation.

        "Abstract": "The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Swi2-like factors Rad54 and Rdh54 play multifaceted roles in homologous recombination via their DNA translocase activity. Aside from promoting Rad51-mediated DNA strand invasion of a partner chromatid, Rad54 and Rdh54 can remove Rad51 from duplex DNA for intracellular recycling. Although the in vitro properties of the two proteins are similar, differences between the phenotypes of the null allele mutants suggest that they play different roles in vivo. Through the isolation of a novel RAD51 allele encoding a protein with reduced affinity for DNA, we provide evidence that Rad54 and Rdh54 have different in vivo interactions with Rad51. The mutant Rad51 forms a complex on duplex DNA that is more susceptible to dissociation by Rdh54. This Rad51 variant distinguishes the in vivo functions of Rad54 and Rdh54, leading to the conclusion that two translocases remove Rad51 from different substrates in vivo. Additionally, we show that a third Swi2-like factor, Uls1, contributes toward Rad51 clearance from chromatin in the absence of Rad54 and Rdh54, and define a hierarchy of action of the Swi2-like translocases for chromosome damage repair.",

        "Abstract": "In physiological settings, nucleic-acid translocases must act on substrates occupied by other proteins, and an increasingly appreciated role of translocases is to catalyse protein displacement from RNA and DNA. However, little is known regarding the inevitable collisions that must occur, and the fate of protein obstacles and the mechanisms by which they are evicted from DNA remain unexplored. Here we sought to establish the mechanistic basis for protein displacement from DNA using RecBCD as a model system. Using nanofabricated curtains of DNA and multicolour single-molecule microscopy, we visualized collisions between a model translocase and different DNA-bound proteins in real time. We show that the DNA translocase RecBCD can disrupt core RNA polymerase, holoenzymes, stalled elongation complexes and transcribing RNA polymerases in either head-to-head or head-to-tail orientations, as well as EcoRI(E111Q), lac repressor and even nucleosomes. RecBCD did not pause during collisions and often pushed proteins thousands of base pairs before evicting them from DNA. We conclude that RecBCD overwhelms obstacles through direct transduction of chemomechanical force with no need for specific protein-protein interactions, and that proteins can be removed from DNA through active disruption mechanisms that act on a transition state intermediate as they are pushed from one nonspecific site to the next.",

Eukaryotic proteins must accomplish this task while navigating through chromatin. Yet it is unknown whether nucleosomes disrupt 1D scanning or eukaryotic DNA-binding factors can circumnavigate nucleosomes without falling off DNA. Here we use single-molecule microscopy in conjunction with nanofabricated curtains of DNA to show that the postreplicative mismatch repair protein complex Mlh1-Pms1 diffuses in 1D along DNA via a hopping/stepping mechanism and readily bypasses nucleosomes. This is the first experimental demonstration that a passively diffusing protein can traverse stationary obstacles. In contrast, Msh2-Msh6, a mismatch repair protein complex that slides while maintaining continuous contact with DNA, experiences a boundary upon encountering nucleosomes. These differences reveal important mechanistic constraints affecting intranuclear trafficking of DNA-binding proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Single-molecule approaches provide a valuable tool in the arsenal of the modern biologist, and new discoveries continue to be made possible through the use of these state-of-the-art technologies. However, it can be inherently difficult to obtain statistically relevant data from experimental approaches specifically designed to probe individual reactions. This problem is compounded with more complex biochemical reactions, heterogeneous systems, and/or reactions requiring the use of long DNA substrates. Here we give an overview of a technology developed in our laboratory, which relies upon simple micro- or nanofabricated structures in combination with \"bio-friendly\" lipid bilayers, to align thousands of long DNA molecules into defined patterns on the surface of a microfluidic sample chamber. We call these \"DNA curtains,\" and we have developed several different versions varying in complexity and DNA substrate configuration, which are designed to meet different experimental needs. This novel approach to single-molecule imaging provides a powerful experimental platform that offers the potential for concurrent observation of hundreds or even thousands of protein-DNA interactions in real time.",

        "Title": "Functional significance of the Rad51-Srs2 complex in Rad51 presynaptic filament disruption.",
        "Abstract": "The SRS2 (Suppressor of RAD Six screen mutant 2) gene encodes an ATP-dependent DNA helicase that regulates homologous recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutations in SRS2 result in a hyper-recombination phenotype, sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and synthetic lethality with mutations that affect DNA metabolism. Several of these phenotypes can be suppressed by inactivating genes of the RAD52 epistasis group that promote homologous recombination, implicating inappropriate recombination as the underlying cause of the mutant phenotype. Consistent with the genetic data, purified Srs2 strongly inhibits Rad51-mediated recombination reactions by disrupting the Rad51-ssDNA presynaptic filament. Srs2 interacts with Rad51 in the yeast two-hybrid assay and also in vitro. To investigate the functional relevance of the Srs2-Rad51 complex, we have generated srs2 truncation mutants that retain full ATPase and helicase activities, but differ in their ability to interact with Rad51. Importantly, the srs2 mutant proteins attenuated for Rad51 interaction are much less capable of Rad51 presynaptic filament disruption. An internal deletion in Srs2 likewise diminishes Rad51 interaction and anti-recombinase activity. We also present evidence that deleting the Srs2 C-terminus engenders a hyper-recombination phenotype. These results highlight the importance of Rad51 interaction in the anti-recombinase function of Srs2, and provide evidence that this Srs2 function can be uncoupled from its helicase activity.",

        "Abstract": "Single-molecule studies of biological macromolecules can benefit from new experimental platforms that facilitate experimental design and data acquisition. Here we develop new strategies to construct curtains of DNA in which the molecules are aligned with respect to one another and maintained in an extended configuration by anchoring both ends of the DNA to the surface of a microfluidic sample chamber that is otherwise coated with an inert lipid bilayer. This \"double-tethered\" DNA substrate configuration is established through the use of nanofabricated rack patterns comprised of two distinct functional elements: linear barriers to lipid diffusion that align DNA molecules anchored by one end to the bilayer and antibody-coated pentagons that provide immobile anchor points for the opposite ends of the DNA. These devices enable the alignment and anchoring of thousands of individual DNA molecules, which can then be visualized using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy under conditions that do not require continuous application of buffer flow to stretch the DNA. This unique strategy offers the potential for studying protein-DNA interactions on large DNA substrates without compromising measurements through application of hydrodynamic force. We provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that double-tethered DNA curtains made with nanofabricated rack patterns can be used in a one-dimensional diffusion assay that monitors the motion of quantum dot-tagged proteins along DNA.",

Our results reveal distributions that are correlated with recent in silico predictions, reinforcing the hypothesis that DNA contains some intrinsic positioning information. We also show that cis-regulatory sequences in human DNA coincide with peaks in the intrinsic landscape, whereas valleys correspond to nonregulatory regions, and we present evidence arguing that nucleosome deposition in vertebrates is influenced by factors that are not accounted for by current theory. Finally, we demonstrate that intrinsic landscapes of nucleosomes containing the centromere-specific variant CenH3 are correlated with patterns observed for canonical nucleosomes, arguing that CenH3 does not alter sequence preferences of centromeric nucleosomes. However, the nonhistone protein Scm3 alters the intrinsic landscape of CenH3-containing nucleosomes, enabling them to overcome the otherwise exclusionary effects of poly(dA-dT) tracts, which are enriched in centromeric DNA.",

        "Abstract": "Rad51 is a core component of the eukaryotic homologous recombination machinery and is responsible for key mechanistic steps during strand invasion. Higher order oligomers of Rad51 display a remarkable degree of structural variation, forming rings, compressed filaments, and elongated filaments. It is unclear whether Rad51 can transition directly between these different oligomeric structures without disassembling first into monomers. We have used single-molecule microscopy to investigate the behavior of human Rad51 assembled on double-stranded DNA. Our results show that human Rad51 can form elongated nucleoprotein filaments on DNA, but ATP hydrolysis causes a decrease in their length without concomitant dissociation of protein. Compressed Rad51 filaments can re-elongate when presented with either ATP or the non-hydrolyzable analog AMP-PNP, and these cycles of elongation and compression are reversible. A Rad51 mutant deficient in ATP hydrolysis is locked into an extended conformation that is incapable of transitioning to a compressed filament. Similarly, wild-type Rad51 bound to DNA in the presence of AMP-PNP was trapped in the elongated state. Proteins incapable of transitioning to the compressed state were also highly resistant to dissociation from the DNA. Taken together, our results indicate that nucleotide hydrolysis by human Rad51 triggers a reversible structural transition leading to filaments with reduced helical pitch.",

        "Abstract": "Rad51 is the core component of the eukaryotic homologous recombination machinery and assembles into elongated nucleoprotein filaments on DNA. We have used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and a DNA curtain assay to investigate the dynamics of individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments. For these experiments the DNA molecules were end-labeled with single fluorescent semiconducting nanocrystals. The assembly and disassembly of the Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments were visualized by tracking the location of the labeled DNA end in real time. Using this approach, we have analyzed yeast Rad51 under a variety of different reaction conditions to assess parameters that impact the stability of the nucleoprotein filament. We show that Rad51 readily dissociates from DNA in the presence of ADP or in the absence of nucleotide cofactor, but that free ATP in solution confers a fivefold increase in the stability of the nucleoprotein filaments. We also probe how protein dissociation is coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis by examining the effects of ATP concentration, and by the use of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido) triphosphate and ATPase active-site mutants. Finally, we demonstrate that the Rad51 gain-of-function mutant I345T dissociates from DNA with kinetics nearly identical to that of wild-type Rad51, but assembles 30% more rapidly. Together, these results provide a framework for studying the biochemical behaviors of S. cerevisiae Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments at the single-molecule level.",

        "Abstract": "Genetic studies in budding and fission yeasts have provided evidence that Rdh54, a Swi2/Snf2-like factor, synergizes with the Dmc1 recombinase to mediate inter-homologue recombination during meiosis. Rdh54 associates with Dmc1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay, but whether the Rdh54-Dmc1 interaction is direct and the manner in which these two recombination factors may functionally co-operate to accomplish their biological task have not yet been defined. Here, using purified Schizosaccharomyces pombe proteins, we demonstrate complex formation between Rdh54 and Dmc1 and enhancement of the recombinase activity of Dmc1 by Rdh54. Consistent with published cytological and chromatin immunoprecipitation data that implicate Rdh54 in preventing the non-specific association of Dmc1 with chromatin, we show here that Rdh54 mediates the efficient removal of Dmc1 from dsDNA. These functional attributes of Rdh54 are reliant on its ATPase function. The results presented herein provide valuable information concerning the Rdh54-Dmc1 protein pair that is germane for understanding their role in meiotic recombination. The biochemical systems established in this study should be useful for the continuing dissection of the action mechanism of Rdh54 and Dmc1.",

The application of single molecule techniques to study DNA processing enzymes has revealed new mechanistic details that are unobtainable from bulk biochemical studies. Homologous DNA recombination is a multi-step pathway that is facilitated by numerous enzymes that must precisely and rapidly manipulate diverse DNA substrates to repair potentially lethal breaks in the DNA duplex.

        "Abstract": "The analysis of individual molecules is evolving into an important tool for biological research, and presents conceptually new ways of approaching experimental design strategies. However, more robust methods are required if these technologies are to be made broadly available to the biological research community. To help achieve this goal we have combined nanofabrication techniques with single-molecule optical microscopy for assembling and visualizing curtains comprised of thousands of individual DNA molecules organized at engineered diffusion barriers on a lipid bilayer-coated surface. Here we present an important extension of this technology that implements geometric barrier patterns comprised of thousands of nanoscale wells that can be loaded with single molecules of DNA. We show that these geometric nanowells can be used to precisely control the lateral distribution of the individual DNA molecules within curtains assembled along the edges of the engineered barrier patterns. The individual molecules making up the DNA curtain can be separated from one another by a user-defined distance dictated by the dimensions of the nanowells. We demonstrate the broader utility of these patterned DNA curtains in a novel, real time restriction assay that we refer to as dynamic optical restriction mapping, which can be used to rapidly identify entire sets of cleavage sites within a large DNA molecule.",

        "Abstract": "Single molecule visualization of protein-DNA complexes can reveal details of reaction mechanisms and macromolecular dynamics inaccessible to traditional biochemical assays. However, these techniques are often limited by the inherent difficulty of collecting statistically relevant information from experiments explicitly designed to look at single events. New approaches that increase throughput capacity of single molecule methods have the potential for making these techniques more readily applicable to a variety of biological questions involving different types of DNA transactions. Here we show that nanofabricated chromium barriers, which are located at strategic positions on a fused silica slide otherwise coated with a supported lipid bilayer, can be used to organize DNA molecules into molecular curtains. The DNA that makes up the curtains is visualized by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) allowing simultaneous imaging of hundreds or thousands of aligned molecules. These DNA curtains present a robust experimental platform portending massively parallel data acquisition of individual protein-DNA interactions in real time.",

A common feature among these single-molecule approaches is the need for the biological molecules to be anchored to a solid support surface. This must be done under conditions that minimize nonspecific adsorption without compromising the biological integrity of the sample. In this review we highlight why surface attachments are a critical aspect of many single-molecule studies and we discuss current methods for anchoring biomolecules.

        "Abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae RDH54 is a key member of the evolutionarily conserved RAD52 epistasis group of genes needed for homologous recombination and DNA double strand break repair. The RDH54-encoded protein possesses a DNA translocase activity and functions together with the Rad51 recombinase in the D-loop reaction. By chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we show that Rdh54 is recruited, in a manner that is dependent on Rad51 and Rad52, to a site-specific DNA double strand break induced by the HO endonuclease. Because of its relatedness to Swi2/Snf2 chromatin remodelers, we have asked whether highly purified Rdh54 possesses chromatin-remodeling activity. Importantly, our results show that Rdh54 can mobilize a mononucleosome along DNA and render nucleosomal DNA accessible to a restriction enzyme, indicative of a chromatin-remodeling function. Moreover, Rdh54 co-operates with Rad51 in the utilization of naked or chromatinized DNA as template for D-loop formation. We also provide evidence for a strict dependence of the chromatin-remodeling attributes of Rdh54 on its ATPase activity and N-terminal domain. Interestingly, an N-terminal deletion mutant (rdh54Delta102) is unable to promote Rad51-mediated D-loop formation with a chromatinized template, while retaining substantial activity with naked DNA. These features of Rdh54 suggest a role of this protein factor in chromatin rearrangement during DNA recombination and repair.",

        "Abstract": "The ability of proteins to locate specific sites or structures among a vast excess of nonspecific DNA is a fundamental theme in biology. Yet the basic principles that govern these mechanisms remain poorly understood. For example, mismatch repair proteins must scan millions of base pairs to find rare biosynthetic errors, and they then must probe the surrounding region to identify the strand discrimination signals necessary to distinguish the parental and daughter strands. To determine how these proteins might function we used single-molecule optical microscopy to answer the following question: how does the mismatch repair complex Msh2-Msh6 interrogate undamaged DNA? Here we show that Msh2-Msh6 slides along DNA via one-dimensional diffusion. These findings indicate that interactions between Msh2-Msh6 and DNA are dominated by lateral movement of the protein along the helical axis and have implications for how MutS family members travel along DNA at different stages of the repair reaction.",

        "Abstract": "We have used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) to investigate the characteristics of the yeast homologous recombination factor Rdh54 on DNA. Our results demonstrate translocation of Rdh54 on DNA and extrusion of DNA loops by Rdh54 in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner. The translocating Rdh54 was highly processive and displayed a variety of behavior, including variations in translocation rate and distance, pauses, and reversals. We provide evidence that the DNA loops generated encompass an average of 6 kb, and Rdh54 often abruptly releases the extruded DNA. Rdh54 forms a multimeric complex, which we speculate has at least two functionally distinct DNA-binding sites, one of which enables translocation while the other remains anchored to another DNA locale. Our work, together with other recent studies, suggests that translocation-coupled DNA loop extrusion is a common mechanistic feature among the Snf2-family of chromatin-remodeling proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Rad51 is the core component of the eukaryotic homologous recombination machinery and assembles into extended nucleoprotein filaments on DNA. To study the dynamic behavior of Rad51 we have developed a single-molecule assay that relies on a combination of hydrodynamic force and microscale diffusion barriers to align individual DNA molecules on the surface of a microfluidic sample chamber that is coated with a lipid bilayer. When visualized with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), these \"molecular curtains\" allow for the direct visualization of hundreds of individual DNA molecules. Using this approach, we have analyzed the binding of human Rad51 to single molecules of double-stranded DNA under a variety of different reaction conditions by monitoring the extension of the fluorescently labeled DNA, which coincides with assembly of the nucleoprotein filament. We have also generated several mutants in conserved regions of Rad51 implicated in DNA binding, and tested them for their ability to assemble into extended filaments. We show that proteins with mutations within the DNA-binding surface located on the N-terminal domain still retain the ability to form extended nucleoprotein filaments. Mutations in the L1 loop, which projects towards the central axis of the filament, completely abolish assembly of extended filaments. In contrast, most mutations within or near the L2 DNA-binding loop, which is also located near the central axis of the filament, do not affect the ability of the protein to assemble into extended filaments on double-stranded (ds)DNA. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the L1-loop plays a crucial role in the assembly of extended nucleoprotein filaments on dsDNA, but the N-terminal domain and the L2 DNA-binding loop have significantly less impact on this process. The results presented here also provide an important initial framework for beginning to study the biochemical behaviors of Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments using our novel experimental system.",

        "Abstract": "The repair of double-stranded DNA breaks by homologous recombination is essential for maintaining genome integrity. Much of what we know about this DNA repair pathway in eukaryotes has been gleaned from genetics, in vivo experiments with GFP-tagged proteins and traditional biochemical experiments with purified proteins. However, many questions have remained inaccessible to these experimental approaches. Recent technological advances have made it possible to directly visualize the behaviors of individual DNA and protein molecules in vitro, and it is now becoming feasible to apply these technology-driven approaches to complex biochemical systems, such as those involved in the repair of damaged DNA. This report summarizes the use of total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to probe fundamental aspects of protein-DNA interactions at the single-molecule level, and specific emphasis is placed on our efforts to develop new methods and techniques for studying DNA repair. Using these new approaches we are investigating the DNA-binding behavior of human Rad51 and we have recently demonstrated that this protein can slide on dsDNA via a one-dimensional random walk mechanism driven solely by thermal fluctuations of the surrounding solvent. Here, we highlight some possible implications of this recent finding, and we also briefly discuss the potential benefits of future single-molecule studies in the study of protein-DNA interactions and DNA repair.",

        "Abstract": "Rad51 is the primary eukaryotic recombinase responsible for initiating DNA strand exchange during homologous recombination. Although the subject of intense study for over a decade, many molecular details of the reactions promoted by Rad51 and related recombinases remain unknown. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we directly visualized the behavior of individual Rad51 complexes on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules suspended in an extended configuration above a lipid bilayer. Here we show that complexes of Rad51 can bind to and slide freely along the helical axis of dsDNA. Sliding is bidirectional, does not require ATP hydrolysis, and displays properties consistent with a 1D random walk driven solely by thermal diffusion. The proteins move freely on the DNA for long periods of time; however, sliding terminates and the proteins become immobile upon encountering the free end of a linear dsDNA molecule. This study provides previously uncharacterized insights into the behaviors of human Rad51, which may apply to other members of the RecA-like family of recombinases.",

Here, we present new methods for tethering large DNA molecules to the surface of a microfluidic sample chamber that has been rendered inert by the deposition of a supported lipid bilayer. These methods take advantage of the \"bio-friendly\" environment provided by zwitterionic lipids, but still allow the DNA molecules to be anchored at fixed positions on the surface. We also demonstrate a new method for constructing parallel arrays of individual DNA molecules assembled at defined positions on a bilayer-coated, fused silica surface. By using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to visualize the arrays, it is possible to simultaneously monitor hundreds of aligned DNA molecules within a single field-of-view. These molecular arrays will significantly increase the throughput capacity of single-molecule, fluorescence-based detection methods by allowing parallel processing of multiple individual reaction trajectories.",

        "Abstract": "MuB, a protein essential for replicative DNA transposition by the bacteriophage Mu, is an ATPase that assembles into a polymeric complex on DNA. We used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to observe the behavior of MuB polymers on single molecules of DNA. We demonstrate that polymer assembly is initiated by a stochastic nucleation event. After nucleation, polymer assembly occurs by a mechanism involving the sequential binding of small units of MuB. MuB that bound to A/T-rich regions of the DNA assembled into large polymeric complexes. In contrast, MuB that bound outside of the A/T-rich regions failed to assemble into large oligomeric complexes. Our data also show that MuB does not catalyze multiple rounds of ATP hydrolysis while remaining bound to DNA. Rather, a single ATP is hydrolyzed, then MuB dissociates from the DNA. Finally, we show that \"capping\" of the enhanced green fluorescent protein-MuB polymer ends with unlabeled MuB dramatically slows, but does not halt, dissociation. This suggests that MuB dissociation occurs through both an end-dependent mechanism and a slower mechanism wherein subunits dissociate from the polymer interior.",

This phenomenon, termed target immunity, involves MuA-stimulated removal of MuB oligomers from sites near the Mu genome. Using a combination of ensemble and single-molecule fluorescence methods, we show that the MuA tetramer can stably associate with the DNA-bound MuB oligomer and is more efficient than monomeric MuA at stimulating the dissociation of MuB from DNA. In addition, we demonstrate that DNA looping is essential for efficient disassembly of the MuB oligomer. We propose a model in which the MuA tetramer forms a multivalent complex with the MuB oligomer and catalyzes the processive removal of MuB from DNA.",

        "Abstract": "MuB, an ATP-dependent DNA binding protein, is critical for selection of target sites on the host chromosome during Mu transposition. We have developed a system for observing the behavior of single MuB polymers bound to an immobilized molecule of DNA. We show that the individual polymers display a broad distribution of disassembly rates and exhibit regional variations in DNA binding. Additionally, ATP hydrolysis was obligatorily coupled to dissociation of MuB subunits from the DNA during polymer disassembly. We propose a model in which the formation of an active target complex is mediated by a conformational change within the MuB polymer that is influenced by the sequence of the DNA.",

        "Title": "Dynamics of a protein polymer: the assembly and disassembly pathways of the MuB transposition target complex.",
        "Abstract": "MuB assembles into a polymer on DNA in the presence of ATP and is directly involved in the selection of an appropriate site on the Escherichia coli chromosome for the insertion of the bacteriophage Mu genome. We have developed an assay using fluorescently tagged proteins to monitor the polymeric state of MuB via fluorescence resonance energy transfer. We show that polymer assembly is initiated by the formation of an ATP-MuB complex. MuB then self-associates into a protomer before binding to DNA. Upon binding to DNA, a dramatic increase in energy transfer is observed, suggesting a conformational change within MuB. Polymer disassembly is much slower than assembly and is greatly stimulated by the MuA transposase. Additionally, MuB is readily exchanged between polymers, and ATP hydrolysis is directly coupled to polymer disassembly. Our data support a model in which a combination of rapid polymer assembly, MuA-mediated disassembly, followed by rapid reassembly of the polymer allows MuB to sample multiple DNA targets until an appropriate site is located for the insertion of the bacteriophage genome.",
