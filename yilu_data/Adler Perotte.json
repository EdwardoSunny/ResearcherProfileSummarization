        "Abstract": "Early identification of cardiac structural abnormalities indicative of heart failure is crucial to improving patient outcomes. Chest X-rays (CXRs) are routinely conducted on a broad population of patients, presenting an opportunity to build scalable screening tools for structural abnormalities indicative of Stage B or worse heart failure with deep learning methods. In this study, a model was developed to identify severe left ventricular hypertrophy (SLVH) and dilated left ventricle (DLV) using CXRs.",

        "Abstract": "Complete and accurate race and ethnicity (RE) patient information is important for many areas of biomedical informatics research, such as defining and characterizing cohorts, performing quality assessments, and identifying health inequities. Patient-level RE data is often inaccurate or missing in structured sources, but can be supplemented through clinical notes and natural language processing (NLP). While NLP has made many improvements in recent years with large language models, bias remains an often-unaddressed concern, with research showing that harmful and negative language is more often used for certain racial/ethnic groups than others. We present an approach to audit the learned associations of models trained to identify RE information in clinical text by measuring the concordance between model-derived salient features and manually identified RE-related spans of text. We show that while models perform well on the surface, there exist concerning learned associations and potential for future harms from RE-identification models if left unaddressed.",

Despite this training scheme, practitioners evaluate models under other criteria, such as binary classification losses at a chosen set of time horizons, e.g. Brier score (BS) and Bernoulli log likelihood (BLL). Models trained with maximum likelihood may have poor BS or BLL since maximum likelihood does not directly optimize these criteria. Directly optimizing criteria like BS requires inverse-weighting by the censoring distribution. However, estimating the censoring model under these metrics requires inverse-weighting by the failure distribution. The objective for each model requires the other, but neither are known.

        "Abstract": "Deceased donor kidney allocation follows a ranked match-run of potential recipients. Organ procurement organizations (OPOs) are permitted to deviate from the mandated match-run in exceptional circumstances. Using match-run data for all deceased donor kidney transplants (Ktx) in the US between 2015 and 2019, we identified 1544\u00a0kidneys transplanted from 933 donors with an OPO-initiated allocation exception. Most OPOs (55/58) used this process at least once, but 3 OPOs performed 64% of the exceptions and just 2 transplant centers received 25% of allocation exception Ktx. At 2 of 3 outlier OPOs these transplants increased 136% and 141% between 2015 and 2019 compared to only a 35% increase in all Ktx. Allocation exception donors had less favorable characteristics (median KDPI 70, 41% with history of hypertension), but only 29% had KDPI\u00a0\u2265\u00a085% and the majority did not meet the traditional threshold for marginal kidneys. Allocation exception kidneys went to larger centers with higher offer acceptance ratios and to recipients with 2 fewer priority points-equivalent to 2\u00a0less years of waiting time. OPO-initiated exceptions for kidney allocation are growing increasingly frequent and more concentrated at a few outlier centers. Increasing pressure to improve organ utilization risks increasing out-of-sequence allocations, potentially exacerbating disparities in access to transplantation.",

        "Abstract": "We introduce Latent Meaning Cells, a deep latent variable model which learns contextualized representations of words by combining local lexical context and metadata. Metadata can refer to granular context, such as section type, or to more global context, such as unique document ids. Reliance on metadata for contextualized representation learning is apropos in the clinical domain where text is semi-structured and expresses high variation in topics. We evaluate the LMC model on the task of zero-shot clinical acronym expansion across three datasets. The LMC significantly outperforms a diverse set of baselines at a fraction of the pre-training cost and learns clinically coherent representations. We demonstrate that not only is metadata itself very helpful for the task, but that the LMC inference algorithm provides an additional large benefit.",

The quality of evidence is organized in a hierarchy in which randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are regarded as least biased. However, RCTs are plagued by poor generalizability, impeding the translation of clinical research to practice. Though the presence of poor external validity is known, the factors that contribute to poor generalizability have not been summarized and placed in a framework. We propose a new population-oriented conceptual framework to facilitate consistent and comprehensive evaluation of generalizability, replicability, and assessment of RCT study quality.",

The clinical natural language processing field has made strides in overcoming domain heterogeneity, while pretrained deep learning models present opportunities to transfer knowledge from one task to another. Pretrained models have performed well when transferred to new tasks; however, it is not well understood if these models generalize across differences in institutions and settings within the clinical domain. We explore if institution or setting specific pretraining is necessary for pretrained models to perform well when transferred to new tasks. We find no significant performance difference between models pretrained across institutions and settings, indicating that clinically pretrained models transfer well across such boundaries. Given a clinically pretrained model, clinical natural language processing researchers may forgo the time-consuming pretraining step without a significant performance drop.",

We sought to assess the association between biopsy findings and post-transplant outcomes when donor characteristics are accounted for. We used registry data to identify 1566 deceased donors of 3132 transplanted kidneys (2015-2020) with discordant right/left procurement biopsy classification and performed time-to-event analyses to determine the association between optimal histology and hazard of death-censored graft failure or death. We then repeated all analyses using a local cohort of 147 donors of kidney pairs with detailed procurement histology data available (2006-2016). Among transplanted kidney pairs in the national cohort, there were no significant differences in incidence of delayed graft function or primary nonfunction. Time to death-censored graft failure was not significantly different between recipients of optimal versus suboptimal kidneys. Results were similar in analyses using the local cohort. Regarding recipient survival, analysis of the national, but not local, cohort showed optimal kidneys were associated with a lower hazard of death (adjusted HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.90, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006). In conclusion, in a large national cohort of deceased donor kidney pairs with discordant right/left procurement biopsy findings, we found no association between histology and death-censored graft survival.",

        "Abstract": "Background Cardiovascular involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and leads to worsened mortality. Diagnostic cardiovascular studies may be helpful for resource appropriation and identifying patients at increased risk for death. Methods and Results We analyzed 887 patients (aged 64\u00b117 years) admitted with COVID-19 from March 1 to April 3, 2020 in New York City with 12 lead electrocardiography within 2 days of diagnosis. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory testing, including high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), were abstracted. At 30 days follow-up, 556 patients (63%) were living without requiring mechanical ventilation, 123 (14%) were living and required mechanical ventilation, and 203 (23%) had expired. Electrocardiography findings included atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF/AFL) in 46 (5%) and ST-T wave changes in 306 (38%). 27 (59%) patients with AF/AFL expired as compared to 181 (21%) of 841 with other non-life-threatening rhythms (",

        "Abstract": "Causal inference often relies on the counterfactual framework, which requires that treatment assignment is independent of the outcome, known as strong ignorability. Approaches to enforcing strong ignorability in causal analyses of observational data include weighting and matching methods. Effect estimates, such as the average treatment effect (ATE), are then estimated as expectations under the re-weighted or matched distribution, P. The choice of P is important and can impact the interpretation of the effect estimate and the variance of effect estimates. In this work, instead of specifying P, we learn a distribution that simultaneously maximizes coverage and minimizes variance of ATE estimates. In order to learn this distribution, this research proposes a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based model called the Counterfactual \u03c7-GAN (cGAN), which also learns feature-balancing weights and supports unbiased causal estimation in the absence of unobserved confounding. Our model minimizes the Pearson \u03c7",

        "Abstract": "Disease phenotyping algorithms are designed to sift through clinical data stores to identify patients with specific diseases. Supervised phenotyping methods require significant quantities of expert-labeled data, while unsupervised methods may learn spurious or non-disease phenotypes. To address these limitations, we propose the Semi-Supervised Mixed Membership Model (SS3M) - a probabilistic graphical model for learning disease phenotypes from partially labeled clinical data. We show SS3M can generate interpretable, disease-specific phenotypes which capture the clinical features of the disease concepts specified by the labels provided to the model. Furthermore, SS3M phenotypes demonstrate competitive predictive performance relative to commonly used baselines.",

        "Abstract": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are regarded as the most reputable source of evidence. In some studies, factors beyond the intervention itself may contribute to the measured effect, an occurrence known as heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE). If the RCT population differs from the real-world population on factors that induce HTE, the trials effect will not replicate. The RCTs eligibility criteria should identify the sub-population in which its evidence will replicate. However, the extent to which the eligibility criteria identify the appropriate population is unknown, which raises concerns for generalizability. We compared reported data from RCTs with real-world data from the electronic health records of a large, academic medical center that was curated according to RCT eligibility criteria. Our results show fundamental differences between the RCT population and our observational cohorts, which suggests that eligibility criteria may be insufficient for identifying the applicable real-world population in which RCT evidence will replicate.",

        "Title": "Elevated GM3 plasma concentration in idiopathic Parkinson's disease: A lipidomic analysis.",
        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease whose pathological hallmark is the accumulation of intracellular \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in Lewy bodies. Lipid metabolism dysregulation may play a significant role in PD pathogenesis; however, large plasma lipidomic studies in PD are lacking. In the current study, we analyzed the lipidomic profile of plasma obtained from 150 idiopathic PD patients and 100 controls, taken from the 'Spot' study at Columbia University Medical Center in New York. Our mass spectrometry based analytical panel consisted of 520 lipid species from 39 lipid subclasses including all major classes of glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, glycerolipids and sterols. Each lipid species was analyzed using a logistic regression model. The plasma concentrations of two lipid subclasses, triglycerides and monosialodihexosylganglioside (GM3), were different between PD and control participants. GM3 ganglioside concentration had the most significant difference between PD and controls (1.531\u00b10.037 pmol/\u03bcl versus 1.337\u00b10.040 pmol/\u03bcl respectively; p-value = 5.96E-04; q-value = 0.048; when normalized to total lipid: p-value = 2.890E-05; q-value = 2.933E-03). Next, we used a collection of 20 GM3 and glucosylceramide (GlcCer) species concentrations normalized to total lipid to perform a ROC curve analysis, and found that these lipids compare favorably with biomarkers reported in previous studies (AUC = 0.742 for males, AUC = 0.644 for females). Our results suggest that higher plasma GM3 levels are associated with PD. GM3 lies in the same glycosphingolipid metabolic pathway as GlcCer, a substrate of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, which has been associated with PD. These findings are consistent with previous reports implicating lower glucocerebrosidase activity with PD risk.",

        "Abstract": "A clear correlation has been observed between the resonance Raman (RR) spectra of plaques in the aortic tunica intimal wall of a human corpse and three states of plaque evolution: fibrolipid plaques, calcified and ossified plaques, and vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques (VPs). These three states of atherosclerotic plaque lesions demonstrated unique RR molecular fingerprints from key molecules, rendering their spectra unique with respect to one another. The vibrational modes of lipids, cholesterol, carotenoids, tryptophan and heme proteins, the amide I, II, III bands, and methyl/methylene groups from the intrinsic atherosclerotic VPs in tissues were studied. The salient outcome of the investigation was demonstrating the correlation between RR measurements of VPs and the thickness measurements of fibrous caps on VPs using standard histopathology methods, an important metric in evaluating the stability of a VP. The RR results show that VPs undergo a structural change when their caps thin to 66 ?? ? m , very close to the 65 - ? m empirical medical definition of a thin cap fibroatheroma plaque, the most unstable type of VP.",

        "Abstract": "Observational research promises to complement experimental research by providing large, diverse populations that would be infeasible for an experiment. Observational research can test its own clinical hypotheses, and observational studies also can contribute to the design of experiments and inform the generalizability of experimental research. Understanding the diversity of populations and the variance in care is one component. In this study, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) collaboration created an international data network with 11 data sources from four countries, including electronic health records and administrative claims data on 250 million patients. All data were mapped to common data standards, patient privacy was maintained by using a distributed model, and results were aggregated centrally. Treatment pathways were elucidated for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and depression. The pathways revealed that the world is moving toward more consistent therapy over time across diseases and across locations, but significant heterogeneity remains among sources, pointing to challenges in generalizing clinical trial results. Diabetes favored a single first-line medication, metformin, to a much greater extent than hypertension or depression. About 10% of diabetes and depression patients and almost 25% of hypertension patients followed a treatment pathway that was unique within the cohort. Aside from factors such as sample size and underlying population (academic medical center versus general population), electronic health records data and administrative claims data revealed similar results. Large-scale international observational research is feasible.",

        "Abstract": "We present the Unsupervised Phenome Model (UPhenome), a probabilistic graphical model for large-scale discovery of computational models of disease, or phenotypes. We tackle this challenge through the joint modeling of a large set of diseases and a large set of clinical observations. The observations are drawn directly from heterogeneous patient record data (notes, laboratory tests, medications, and diagnosis codes), and the diseases are modeled in an unsupervised fashion. We apply UPhenome to two qualitatively different mixtures of patients and diseases: records of extremely sick patients in the intensive care unit with constant monitoring, and records of outpatients regularly followed by care providers over multiple years. We demonstrate that the UPhenome model can learn from these different care settings, without any additional adaptation. Our experiments show that (i) the learned phenotypes combine the heterogeneous data types more coherently than baseline LDA-based phenotypes; (ii) they each represent single diseases rather than a mix of diseases more often than the baseline ones; and (iii) when applied to unseen patient records, they are correlated with the patients' ground-truth disorders. Code for training, inference, and quantitative evaluation is made available to the research community.",

        "Abstract": "Developing electronic health record (EHR) phenotyping algorithms involves generating queries that run across the EHR data repository. Algorithms are commonly assessed within demonstration studies. There remains, however, little emphasis on assessing the precision and accuracy of measurement methods during the evaluation process. Depending on the complexity of an algorithm, interim refinements may be required to improve measurement methods. Therefore, we develop an evaluation framework that incorporates both measurement and demonstration studies. We evaluate a baseline EHR phenotyping algorithm for drug induced liver injury (DILI) developed in collaboration with electronic Medical Records Genomics (eMERGE) network participants. We conduct a measurement study and report qualitative (i.e., perceptions of evaluation approach effectiveness) and quantitative (i.e., inter-rater reliability) measures. We also conduct a demonstration study and report qualitative (i.e., appropriateness of results) and quantitative (i.e., positive predictive value) measures. Given results from the measurement study, our evaluation approach underwent multiple changes including the addition of laboratory value visualization and an expanded review of clinical notes. Results from the demonstration study informed changes to our algorithm. For example, given the goal of eMERGE to identify patients who may have a genetic susceptibility to DILI, we excluded overdose patients.",

We aim to study the properties of one of the more commonly available but historically unreliable types of data: administrative diagnoses in the form of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD9) codes. We use differential entropy of ICD9 code time series as a surrogate measure for disease time course and also explore Gaussian kernel smoothing to characterize the time course of diseases in a more fine-grained way. Compared to a gold standard created by a panel of clinicians, the first model classified diseases into acute and chronic groups with a receiver operating characteristic area under curve of 0.83. In the second model, several characteristic temporal profiles were observed including permanent, chronic, and acute. In addition, condition dynamics such as the refractory period for giving birth following childbirth were observed. These models demonstrate that ICD9 codes, despite well-documented concerns, contain valid and potentially valuable temporal information.",

        "Abstract": "The stability-plasticity problem (i.e. how the brain incorporates new information into its model of the world, while at the same time preserving existing knowledge) has been at the forefront of computational memory research for several decades. In this paper, we critically evaluate how well the Complementary Learning Systems theory of hippocampo-cortical interactions addresses the stability-plasticity problem. We identify two major challenges for the model: Finding a learning algorithm for cortex and hippocampus that enacts selective strengthening of weak memories, and selective punishment of competing memories; and preventing catastrophic forgetting in the case of non-stationary environments (i.e. when items are temporarily removed from the training set). We then discuss potential solutions to these problems: First, we describe a recently developed learning algorithm that leverages neural oscillations to find weak parts of memories (so they can be strengthened) and strong competitors (so they can be punished), and we show how this algorithm outperforms other learning algorithms (CPCA Hebbian learning and Leabra at memorizing overlapping patterns. Second, we describe how autonomous re-activation of memories (separately in cortex and hippocampus) during REM sleep, coupled with the oscillating learning algorithm, can reduce the rate of forgetting of input patterns that are no longer present in the environment. We then present a simple demonstration of how this process can prevent catastrophic interference in an AB-AC learning paradigm.",
