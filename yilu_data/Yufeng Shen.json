        "Title": "Reference-informed prediction of alternative splicing and splicing-altering mutations from sequences.",
        "Abstract": "Alternative splicing plays a crucial role in protein diversity and gene expression regulation in higher eukaryotes, and mutations causing dysregulated splicing underlie a range of genetic diseases. Computational prediction of alternative splicing from genomic sequences not only provides insight into gene-regulatory mechanisms but also helps identify disease-causing mutations and drug targets. However, the current methods for the quantitative prediction of splice site usage still have limited accuracy. Here, we present DeltaSplice, a deep neural network model optimized to learn the impact of mutations on quantitative changes in alternative splicing from the comparative analysis of homologous genes. The model architecture enables DeltaSplice to perform \"reference-informed prediction\" by incorporating the known splice site usage of a reference gene sequence to improve its prediction on splicing-altering mutations. We benchmarked DeltaSplice and several other state-of-the-art methods on various prediction tasks, including evolutionary sequence divergence on lineage-specific splicing and splicing-altering mutations in human populations and neurodevelopmental disorders, and demonstrated that DeltaSplice outperformed consistently. DeltaSplice predicted \u223c15% of splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) in the human brain as causal splicing-altering variants. It also predicted splicing-altering de novo mutations outside the splice sites in a subset of patients affected by autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including 19 genes with recurrent splicing-altering mutations. Integration of splicing-altering mutations with other types of de novo mutation burdens allowed the prediction of eight novel NDD-risk genes. Our work expanded the capacity of in silico splicing models with potential applications in genetic diagnosis and the development of splicing-based precision medicine.",

        "Abstract": "While genome sequencing has transformed medicine by elucidating the genetic underpinnings of both rare and common complex disorders, its utility to predict clinical outcomes remains understudied. Here, we used artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to explore the predictive value of genome sequencing in forecasting clinical outcomes following surgery for congenital heart defects (CHD). We report results for a cohort of 2,253 CHD patients from the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium with a broad range of complex heart defects, pre- and post-operative clinical variables and exome sequencing. Damaging genotypes in chromatin-modifying and cilia-related genes were associated with an elevated risk of adverse post-operative outcomes, including mortality, cardiac arrest and prolonged mechanical ventilation. The impact of damaging genotypes was further amplified in the context of specific CHD phenotypes, surgical complexity and extra-cardiac anomalies. The absence of a damaging genotype in chromatin-modifying and cilia-related genes was also informative, reducing the risk for adverse postoperative outcomes. Thus, genome sequencing enriches the ability to forecast outcomes following congenital cardiac surgery.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate prediction of the functional impact of missense variants is important for disease gene discovery, clinical genetic diagnostics, therapeutic strategies, and protein engineering. Previous efforts have focused on predicting a binary pathogenicity classification, but the functional impact of missense variants is multi-dimensional. Pathogenic missense variants in the same gene may act through different modes of action (i.e., gain/loss-of-function) by affecting different aspects of protein function. They may result in distinct clinical conditions that require different treatments. We developed a new method, PreMode, to perform gene-specific mode-of-action predictions. PreMode models effects of coding sequence variants using SE(3)-equivariant graph neural networks on protein sequences and structures. Using the largest-to-date set of missense variants with known modes of action, we showed that PreMode reached state-of-the-art performance in multiple types of mode-of-action predictions by efficient transfer-learning. Additionally, PreMode's prediction of G/LoF variants in a kinase is consistent with inactive-active conformation transition energy changes. Finally, we show that PreMode enables efficient study design of deep mutational scans and optimization in protein engineering.",

        "Title": "The osteoclastic activity in apical distal region of molar mesial roots affects orthodontic tooth movement and root resorption in rats.",
        "Abstract": "The utilization of optimal orthodontic force is crucial to prevent undesirable side effects and ensure efficient tooth movement during orthodontic treatment. However, the sensitivity of existing detection techniques is not sufficient, and the criteria for evaluating optimal force have not been yet established. Here, by employing 3D finite element analysis methodology, we found that the apical distal region (A-D region) of mesial roots is particularly sensitive to orthodontic force in rats. Tartrate-resistant acidic phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts began accumulating in the A-D region under the force of 40 grams (g), leading to alveolar bone resorption and tooth movement. When the force reached 80\u2009g, TRAP-positive osteoclasts started appearing on the root surface in the A-D region. Additionally, micro-computed tomography revealed a significant root resorption at 80\u2009g. Notably, the A-D region was identified as a major contributor to whole root resorption. It was determined that 40\u2009g is the minimum effective force for tooth movement with minimal side effects according to the analysis of tooth movement, inclination, and hyalinization. These findings suggest that the A-D region with its changes on the root surface is an important consideration and sensitive indicator when evaluating orthodontic forces for a rat model. Collectively, our investigations into this region would aid in offering valuable implications for preventing and minimizing root resorption during patients' orthodontic treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Rare coding mutations cause \u223c45% of congenital heart disease (CHD). Noncoding mutations that perturb cis-regulatory elements (CREs) likely contribute to the remaining cases, but their identification has been problematic. Using a lentiviral massively parallel reporter assay (lentiMPRA) in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), we functionally evaluated 6,590 noncoding de novo variants (ncDNVs) prioritized from the whole-genome sequencing of 750 CHD trios. A total of 403 ncDNVs substantially affected cardiac CRE activity. A majority increased enhancer activity, often at regions with undetectable reference sequence activity. Of ten DNVs tested by introduction into their native genomic context, four altered the expression of neighboring genes and iPSC-CM transcriptional state. To prioritize future DNVs for functional testing, we used the MPRA data to develop a regression model, EpiCard. Analysis of an independent CHD cohort by EpiCard found enrichment of DNVs. Together, we developed a scalable system to measure the effect of ncDNVs on CRE activity and deployed it to systematically assess the contribution of ncDNVs to CHD.",

We integrated clonotype, alloreactivity, and gene expression profiles of graft-repopulating recipient T cells in the intestinal mucosa at the single-cell level after human intestinal transplantation. Host-versus-graft (HvG)-reactive T cells were mainly distributed to TRM, effector T (Teff)/TRM, and T follicular helper compartments. RNA velocity analysis demonstrated a trajectory from TRM to Teff/TRM clusters in association with rejection. By integrating pre- and post-transplantation (Tx) mixed lymphocyte reaction-determined alloreactive repertoires, we observed that pre-existing HvG-reactive T cells that demonstrated tolerance in the circulation were dominated by TRM profiles in quiescent allografts. Putative de novo HvG-reactive clones showed a transcriptional profile skewed to cytotoxic effectors in rejecting grafts. Inferred protein regulon network analysis revealed upstream regulators that accounted for the effector and tolerant T cell states. We demonstrate Teff/TRM interchangeability for individual T cell clones with known (allo)recognition in the human gut, providing novel insight into TRM biology.",

        "Abstract": "Bassoon (BSN) is a component of a hetero-dimeric presynaptic cytomatrix protein that orchestrates neurotransmitter release with Piccolo (PCLO) from glutamatergic neurons throughout the brain. Heterozygous missense variants in BSN have previously been associated with neurodegenerative disorders in humans. We performed an exome-wide association analysis of ultra-rare variants in about 140,000 unrelated individuals from the UK Biobank to search for new genes associated with obesity. We found that rare heterozygous predicted loss of function (pLoF) variants in BSN are associated with higher BMI with p-value of 3.6e-12 in the UK biobank cohort. Additionally, we identified two individuals (one of whom has a de novo variant) with a heterozygous pLoF variant in a cohort of early onset or extreme obesity and report the clinical histories of these individuals with non-syndromic obesity with no history of neurobehavioral or cognitive disability. The BMI association was replicated in the All of Us whole genome sequencing data. Heterozygous pLoF BSN variants constitute a new etiology for obesity.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a relatively common and genetically heterogeneous structural birth defect associated with high mortality and morbidity. We describe eight unrelated families with an X-linked condition characterized by diaphragm defects, variable anterior body-wall anomalies, and/or facial dysmorphism. Using linkage analysis and exome or genome sequencing, we found that missense variants in plastin 3 (PLS3), a gene encoding an actin bundling protein, co-segregate with disease in all families. Loss-of-function variants in PLS3 have been previously associated with X-linked osteoporosis (MIM: 300910), so we used in silico protein modeling and a mouse model to address these seemingly disparate clinical phenotypes. The missense variants in individuals with CDH are located within the actin-binding domains of the protein but are not predicted to affect protein structure, whereas the variants in individuals with osteoporosis are predicted to result in loss of function. A mouse knockin model of a variant identified in one of the CDH-affected families, c.1497G>C (p.Trp499Cys), shows partial perinatal lethality and recapitulates the key findings of the human phenotype, including diaphragm and abdominal-wall defects. Both the mouse model and one adult human male with a CDH-associated PLS3 variant were observed to have increased rather than decreased bone mineral density. Together, these clinical and functional data in humans and mice reveal that specific missense variants affecting the actin-binding domains of PLS3 might have a gain-of-function effect and cause a Mendelian congenital disorder.",

        "Abstract": "Rare or de novo variants have substantial contribution to human diseases, but the statistical power to identify risk genes by rare variants is generally low due to rarity of genotype data. Previous studies have shown that risk genes usually have high expression in relevant cell types, although for many conditions the identity of these cell types are largely unknown. Recent efforts in single cell atlas in human and model organisms produced large amount of gene expression data. Here we present VBASS, a Bayesian method that integrates single-cell expression and de novo variant (DNV) data to improve power of disease risk gene discovery. VBASS models disease risk prior as a function of expression profiles, approximated by deep neural networks. It learns the weights of neural networks and parameters of Gamma-Poisson likelihood models of DNV counts jointly from expression and genetics data. On simulated data, VBASS shows proper error rate control and better power than state-of-the-art methods. We applied VBASS to published datasets and identified more candidate risk genes with supports from literature or data from independent cohorts. VBASS can be generalized to integrate other types of functional genomics data in statistical genetics analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate prediction of damaging missense variants is critically important for interpreting a genome sequence. Although many methods have been developed, their performance has been limited. Recent advances in machine learning and the availability of large-scale population genomic sequencing data provide new opportunities to considerably improve computational predictions. Here we describe the graphical missense variant pathogenicity predictor (gMVP), a new method based on graph attention neural networks. Its main component is a graph with nodes that capture predictive features of amino acids and edges weighted by co-evolution strength, enabling effective pooling of information from the local protein context and functionally correlated distal positions. Evaluation of deep mutational scan data shows that gMVP outperforms other published methods in identifying damaging variants in ",

        "Abstract": "Infancy and childhood are critical life stages for generating immune memory to protect against pathogens; however, the timing, location, and pathways for memory development in humans remain elusive. Here, we investigated T\u00a0cells in mucosal sites, lymphoid tissues, and blood from 96 pediatric donors aged 0-10 years using phenotypic, functional, and transcriptomic profiling. Our results revealed that memory T\u00a0cells preferentially localized in the intestines and lungs during infancy and accumulated more rapidly in mucosal sites compared with blood and lymphoid organs, consistent with site-specific antigen exposure. Early life mucosal memory T\u00a0cells exhibit distinct functional capacities and stem-like transcriptional profiles. In later childhood, they progressively adopt proinflammatory functions and tissue-resident signatures, coincident with increased T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion in mucosal and lymphoid sites. Together, our findings identify staged development of memory T\u00a0cells targeted to tissues during the formative years, informing how we might promote and monitor immunity in children.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) has become a serious threat to human health. Bone regeneration deficiency and nonunion caused by DM is perceived as a worldwide epidemic, with a very high socioeconomic impact on public health. Here, we find that targeted activation of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor \u03b1 (ROR\u03b1) by SR1078 in the early stage of bone defect repair can significantly promote in situ bone regeneration of DM rats. Bone regeneration relies on the activation of macrophage ROR\u03b1 in the early bone repair, but ROR\u03b1 of DM rats fails to upregulation as hyperglycemic inflammatory microenvironment induced IGF1-AMPK signalling deficiency. Mechanistic investigations suggest that ROR\u03b1 is vital for macrophage-induced migration and proliferation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) via a CCL3/IL-6 depending manner. In summary, our study identifies ROR\u03b1 expressed in macrophages during the early stage of bone defect repair is crucial for in situ bone regeneration, and offers a novel strategy for bone regeneration therapy and fracture repair in DM patients.",

        "Abstract": "Exposure to artificial light at night (LAN) can induce obesity, depressive disorder and osteoporosis, but the pernicious effects of excessive LAN exposure on tissue structure are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that artificial LAN can impair developmental growth plate cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) formation and cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dilation, which in turn compromises bone formation. Excessive LAN exposure induces downregulation of the core circadian clock protein BMAL1, which leads to collagen accumulation in the ER. Further investigations suggest that BMAL1 is the direct transcriptional activator of prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 1 (P4ha1) in chondrocytes, which orchestrates collagen prolyl hydroxylation and secretion. BMAL1 downregulation induced by LAN markedly inhibits proline hydroxylation and transport of collagen from ER to golgi, thereby inducing ER stress in chondrocytes. Restoration of BMAL1/P4HA1 signaling can effectively rescue the dysregulation of cartilage formation within the developmental growth plate induced by artificial LAN exposure. In summary, our investigations suggested that LAN is a significant risk factor in bone growth and development, and a proposed novel strategy targeting enhancement of BMAL1-mediated collagen hydroxylation could be a potential therapeutic approach to facilitate bone growth.",

Epidemiologic evidence supports a role of genetics in the development of CHD. Genetic diagnoses can inform prognosis and clinical management. However, genetic testing is not standardized among individuals with CHD. We sought to develop a list of validated CHD genes using established methods and to evaluate the process of returning genetic results to research participants in a large genomic study.",

The phase shows a U-shape retention profile and it exhibits typical hydrophilic characteristic when the organic solvent fraction in the mobile phase is > 60%. Hydrogen bonding, anion exchange, and hydrophobic interaction are involved in the retention mechanism. Good separation and unique selectivity for acidic, basic and neutral polar analytes were achieved. It showed extremely low column bleed (comparable to that of blank) under gradient elution mode (even to 50% fraction of water) and wide pH tollerance range (at least 1-13).",

        "Abstract": "Accurate variant pathogenicity predictions are important in genetic studies of human diseases. Inframe insertion and deletion variants (indels) alter protein sequence and length, but not as deleterious as frameshift indels. Inframe indel Interpretation is challenging due to limitations in the available number of known pathogenic variants for training. Existing prediction methods largely use manually encoded features including conservation, protein structure and function, and allele frequency to infer variant pathogenicity. Recent advances in deep learning modeling of protein sequences and structures provide an opportunity to improve the representation of salient features based on large numbers of protein sequences. We developed a new pathogenicity predictor for SHort Inframe iNsertion and dEletion (SHINE). SHINE uses pretrained protein language models to construct a latent representation of an indel and its protein context from protein sequences and multiple protein sequence alignments, and feeds the latent representation into supervised machine learning models for pathogenicity prediction. We curated training data from ClinVar and gnomAD, and created two test datasets from different sources. SHINE achieved better prediction performance than existing methods for both deletion and insertion variants in these two test datasets. Our work suggests that unsupervised protein language models can provide valuable information about proteins, and new methods based on these models can improve variant interpretation in genetic analyses.",

        "Abstract": "Oral wounds under diabetic conditions display a significant delay during the healing process, mainly due to oxidative stress-induced inflammatory status and abnormal immune responses. Besides, the wet and complicated dynamic environment of the oral cavity impedes stable treatment of oral wounds. To overcome these, a biomimetic hydrogel adhesive was innovatively developed based on a mussel-inspired multifunctional structure. The adhesive displays efficient adhesion and mechanical harmony on the oral mucosa through enhanced bonding in an acidic proinflammatory environment. The bioadhesive hydrogel exhibits excellent antioxidative properties by mimicking antioxidative enzymatic activities to reverse reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated immune disorders. Experiments on oral wounds of diabetic rats showed that this hydrogel adhesive could effectively protect against mucosal wounds and obviously shorten the inflammatory phase, thus promoting the wound-healing process. Therefore, this study offers a promising therapeutic choice with the potential to advance the clinical treatment of diabetic oral wounds.",

        "Abstract": "Insufficient bone matrix formation caused by diabetic chronic inflammation can result in bone nonunion, which is perceived as a worldwide epidemic, with a substantial socioeconomic and public health burden. Macrophages in microenvironment orchestrate the inflammation and launch the process of bone remodeling and repair, but aberrant activation of macrophages can drive drastic inflammatory responses during diabetic bone regeneration. In diabetes mellitus, the proliferation of resident macrophages in bone microenvironment is limited, while enhanced myeloid differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) leads to increased and constant monocyte recruitment and thus macrophages shift toward the classic pro-inflammatory phenotype, which leads to the deficiency of bone regeneration. In this review, we systematically summarized the anomalous origin of macrophages under diabetic conditions. Moreover, we evaluated the deficit of pro-regeneration macrophages in the diabetic inflammatory microenvironment. Finally, we further discussed the latest developments on strategies based on targeting macrophages to promote diabetic bone regeneration. Briefly, this review aimed to provide a basis for modulating the biological functions of macrophages to accelerate bone regeneration and rescue diabetic fracture healing in the future.",

This study extends those results across the lifespan, with genomic disorders enriched in both pediatric and adult patients compared with controls. In the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study, genomic disorders were also associated with lower serum Mg, lower educational performance, and a higher risk of death. A phenome-wide association study confirmed the link between kidney disease and genomic disorders in an unbiased way. Systematic detection of genomic disorders can provide a molecular diagnosis and refine prediction of risk and prognosis.",

        "Abstract": "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are rare, debilitating autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system. Many NMOSD patients have antibodies to Aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Prior studies show associations of NMOSD with individual Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles and with mutations in the complement pathway and potassium channels. HLA allele associations with NMOSD are inconsistent between populations, suggesting complex relationships between the identified alleles and risk of disease. We used a retrospective case-control approach to identify contributing genetic variants in patients who met the diagnostic criteria for NMOSD and their unaffected family members. Potentially deleterious variants identified in NMOSD patients were compared to members of their families who do not have the disease and to existing databases of human genetic variation. HLA sequences from patients from Belgrade, Serbia, were compared to the frequency of HLA haplotypes in the general population in Belgrade. We analyzed exome sequencing on 40 NMOSD patients and identified rare inherited variants in the complement pathway and potassium channel genes. Haplotype analysis further detected two haplotypes, HLA-A*01, B*08, DRB1*03 and HLA-A*01, B*08, C*07, DRB1*03, DQB1*02, which were more prevalent in NMOSD patients than in unaffected individuals. ",

        "Abstract": "Exome sequencing is widely used in genetic studies of human diseases and clinical genetic diagnosis. Accurate detection of copy number variants (CNVs) is important to fully utilize exome sequencing data. However, exome data are noisy. None of the existing methods alone can achieve both high precision and recall rate. A common practice is to perform heuristic filtration followed by manual inspection of read depth of putative CNVs. This approach does not scale in large studies. To address this issue, we developed a transfer learning method, CNV-espresso, for in silico confirming rare CNVs from exome sequencing data. CNV-espresso encodes candidate CNVs from exome data as images and uses pretrained convolutional neural network models to classify copy number states. We trained CNV-espresso using an offspring-parents trio exome sequencing dataset, with inherited CNVs as positives and CNVs with Mendelian errors as negatives. We evaluated the performance using additional samples that have both exome and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. Assuming the CNVs detected from WGS data as a proxy of ground truth, CNV-espresso significantly improves precision while keeping recall almost intact, especially for CNVs that span a small number of exons. CNV-espresso can effectively replace manual inspection of CNVs in large-scale exome sequencing studies.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a collection of anatomically and clinically heterogeneous structure anomalies of heart at birth. Finding genetic causes of CHD can not only shed light on developmental biology of heart, but also provide basis for improving clinical care and interventions. The optimal study design and analytical approaches to identify genetic causes depend on the underlying genetic architecture. A few well-known syndromes with CHD as core conditions, such as Noonan and CHARGE, have known monogenic causes. The genetic causes of most of CHD patients, however, are unknown and likely to be complex. In this review, we highlight recent studies that assume a complex genetic architecture of CHD with two main approaches. One is genomic sequencing studies aiming for identifying rare or de novo risk variants with large genetic effect. The other is genome-wide association studies optimized for common variants with moderate genetic effect.",

To understand mechanisms of \u03b2-cell dysfunction, we generated stem cell-derived pancreatic endocrine cells with hypomorphic mutations in HNF1A. HNF1A-deficient \u03b2-cells display impaired basal and glucose stimulated-insulin secretion, reduced intracellular calcium levels in association with a reduction in CACNA1A expression, and accumulation of abnormal\u00a0insulin granules in association with SYT13 down-regulation. Knockout of CACNA1A and SYT13 reproduce the relevant phenotypes. In HNF1A deficient \u03b2-cells, glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea drug used in the treatment of HNF1A-MODY patients, increases intracellular calcium, and restores insulin secretion. While insulin secretion defects are constitutive in \u03b2-cells null for HNF1A, \u03b2-cells heterozygous for hypomorphic HNF1A (R200Q) mutations lose the ability to secrete insulin gradually; this phenotype is prevented by correction of the mutation. Our studies illuminate the molecular basis for the efficacy of treatment of HNF1A-MODY with sulfonylureas, and suggest promise for the use of cell therapies.",

        "Title": "Newborn screening for neurodevelopmental diseases: Are we there yet?",
        "Abstract": "In the US, newborn screening (NBS) is a unique health program that supports health equity and screens virtually every baby after birth, and has brought timely treatments to babies since the 1960's. With the decreasing cost of sequencing and the improving methods to interpret genetic data, there is an opportunity to add DNA sequencing as a screening method to facilitate the identification of babies with treatable conditions that cannot be identified in any other scalable way, including highly penetrant genetic neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). However, the lack of effective dietary or drug-based treatments has made it nearly impossible to consider NDDs in the current NBS framework, yet it is anticipated that any treatment will be maximally effective if started early. Hence there is a critical need for large scale pilot studies to assess if and how NDDs can be effectively screened at birth, if parents desire that information, and what impact early diagnosis may have. Here we attempt to provide an overview of the recent advances in NDD treatments, explore the possible framework of setting up a pilot study to genetically screen for NDDs, highlight key technical, practical, and ethical considerations and challenges, and examine the policy and health system implications.",

        "Abstract": "Pathogenic variants in the CACNA1A gene have been associated with episodic ataxia type 2, familial hemiplegic migraine, and spinocerebellar ataxia 6. With increasing use of clinical genetic testing, associations have expanded to include developmental delay, epilepsy, paroxysmal dystonia, and neuropsychiatric disorders. We report 47 individuals with 33 unique likely pathogenic or pathogenic CACNA1A variants. A machine learning method, funNCion, was used to predict loss-of-function (LoF)/gain-of-function (GoF) impact of genetic variants, and a heuristic severity score was designed to analyze genotype/phenotype correlations. Commonly reported phenotypes include developmental delay/intellectual disability (96%), hemiplegic migraines (36%), episodic ataxia type 2 (32%), epilepsy (55%), autism spectrum disorder (23%), and paroxysmal tonic upward gaze (36%). Severity score was significantly higher for predicted GoF variants, variants in the S5/S6 helices, and the recurrent p.Val1392Met variant. Seizures/status epilepticus were correlated with GoF and were more frequent in those with the p.Val1392Met variant. Our findings demonstrate a breadth of disease severity in CACNA1A-related disease and suggest that the clinical phenotypic heterogeneity likely reflects diverse molecular phenotypes. A better understanding of the natural history of CACNA1A-related disease and genotype/phenotype correlations will help inform prognosis and prepare for future clinical trials.",

        "Title": "A homozygous splice variant in ATP5PO, disrupts mitochondrial complex V function and causes Leigh syndrome in two unrelated families.",
        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial complex V plays an important role in oxidative phosphorylation by catalyzing the generation of ATP. Most complex V subunits are nuclear encoded and not yet associated with recognized Mendelian disorders. Using exome sequencing, we identified a rare homozygous splice variant (c.87+3A>G) in ATP5PO, the complex V subunit which encodes the oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein, in three individuals from two unrelated families, with clinical suspicion of a mitochondrial disorder. These individuals had a similar, severe infantile and often lethal multi-systemic disorder that included hypotonia, developmental delay, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, progressive epileptic encephalopathy, progressive cerebral atrophy, and white matter abnormalities on brain MRI consistent with Leigh syndrome. cDNA studies showed a predominant shortened transcript with skipping of exon 2 and low levels of the normal full-length transcript. Fibroblasts from the affected individuals demonstrated decreased ATP5PO protein, defective assembly of complex V with markedly reduced amounts of peripheral stalk proteins, and complex V hydrolytic activity. Further, expression of human ATP5PO cDNA without exon 2 (hATP5PO-\u2206ex2) in yeast cells deleted for yATP5 (ATP5PO homolog) was unable to rescue growth on media which requires oxidative phosphorylation when compared to the wild type construct (hATP5PO-WT), indicating that exon 2 deletion leads to a non-functional protein. Collectively, our findings support the pathogenicity of the ATP5PO c.87+3A>G variant, which significantly reduces but does not eliminate complex V activity. These data along with the recent report of an affected individual with ATP5PO variants, add to the evidence that rare biallelic variants in ATP5PO result in defective complex V assembly, function and are associated with Leigh syndrome.",

Therefore, a novel arctigenin derivative, 4-(2-methylimidazole) octanoxy-arctigenin (MON), was synthesized to assess the antiviral activity against SVCV in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated MON decreased the SVCV glycoprotein (G) gene expression in vitro by a maximum inhibitory rate of > 99% at 3.5 \u03bcM. Furthermore, MON showed the protective effect on epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells and considerably decreased the cytopathic effect (CPE). More importantly, MON inhibited SVCV G gene expression levels in vitro at the half-maximal activity (IC",

        "Title": "Neither cardiac mitochondrial DNA variation nor copy number contribute to congenital heart disease risk.",
        "Abstract": "The well-established manifestation of mitochondrial mutations in functional cardiac disease (e.g., mitochondrial cardiomyopathy) prompted the hypothesis that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence and/or copy number (mtDNAcn) variation contribute to cardiac defects in congenital heart disease (CHD). MtDNAcns were calculated and rare, non-synonymous mtDNA mutations were identified in 1,837 CHD-affected proband-parent trios, 116 CHD-affected singletons, and 114 paired cardiovascular tissue/blood samples. The variant allele fraction (VAF) of heteroplasmic variants in mitochondrial RNA from 257 CHD cardiovascular tissue samples was also calculated. On average, mtDNA from blood had 0.14 rare variants and 52.9 mtDNA copies per nuclear genome per proband. No variation with parental age at proband birth or CHD-affected proband age was seen. mtDNAcns in valve/vessel tissue (320 \u00b1 70) were lower than in atrial tissue (1,080 \u00b1 320, p\u00a0= 6.8E-21), which were lower than in ventricle tissue (1,340 \u00b1 280, p\u00a0= 1.4E-4). The frequency of rare variants in CHD-affected individual DNA was indistinguishable from the frequency in an unaffected cohort, and proband mtDNAcns did not vary from those of CHD cohort parents. In both the CHD and the comparison cohorts, mtDNAcns were significantly correlated between mother-child, father-child, and mother-father. mtDNAcns among people with European (mean\u00a0= 52.0), African (53.0), and Asian haplogroups (53.5) were calculated and were significantly different for European and Asian haplogroups (p\u00a0= 2.6E-3). Variant heteroplasmic fraction (HF) in blood correlated well with paired cardiovascular tissue HF (r\u00a0= 0.975) and RNA VAF (r\u00a0= 0.953), which suggests blood HF is a reasonable proxy for HF in heart tissue. We conclude that mtDNA mutations and mtDNAcns are unlikely to contribute significantly to CHD risk.",

This has enabled discovery of sequences and patterns of T-cell enrichment and deletion associated with clinical outcomes such as transplant rejection and tolerance. The codebase includes user-friendly default analyses with customizable parameters which greatly accelerate computational workflows and provide robust statistics comparing post-transplant specimens to pre-transplant baseline. It also includes helper functions for robust characterization of T-cell-repertoire diversity, sample-to-sample divergence, resolution of sample-of-origin ambiguity in pooled assays, and functions to output all sequences defined as alloreactive.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common anomaly at birth, with a prevalence of \u22481%. While infants born to mothers with diabetes or obesity have a 2- to 3-fold increased incidence of CHD, the cause of the increase is unknown. Damaging de novo variants (DNV) in coding regions are more common among patients with CHD, but genome-wide rates of coding and noncoding DNVs associated with these prenatal exposures have not been studied in patients with CHD.",

Using clinical interpretation guidelines and targeting genes implicated in cardiomyopathy, we identified a genetic cause in 32% of affected individuals. Cardiomyopathy sub-phenotypes differed by ancestry, age at diagnosis, and family history. Infants < 1 year were less likely to have a molecular diagnosis (p < 0.001). Using a discovery set of 1,703 candidate genes and informatic tools, we identified rare and damaging variants in 56% of affected individuals. We see an excess burden of damaging variants in affected individuals as compared to two independent control sets, 1000 Genomes Project (p < 0.001) and SPARK parental controls (p < 1\u00a0\u00d7 10",

        "Title": "Imputing cognitive impairment in SPARK, a large autism cohort.",
        "Abstract": "Diverse large cohorts are necessary for dissecting subtypes of autism, and intellectual disability is one of the most robust endophenotypes for analysis. However, current cognitive assessment methods are not feasible at scale. We developed five commonly used machine learning models to predict cognitive impairment (FSIQ<80 and FSIQ<70) and FSIQ scores among 521 children with autism using parent-reported online surveys in SPARK, and evaluated them in an independent set (n\u00a0=\u00a01346) with a missing data rate up to 70%. We assessed accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity by comparing predicted cognitive levels against clinical IQ data. The elastic-net model has good performance (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.876, sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a00.772, specificity\u00a0=\u00a00.803) using 129 predictive features to impute cognitive impairment (FSIQ<80). Top-ranked predictive features included parent-reported language and cognitive levels, age at autism diagnosis, and history of services. Prediction of FSIQ<70 and FSIQ scores also showed good performance. We show cognitive levels can be imputed with high accuracy for children with autism, using commonly collected parent-reported data and standardized surveys. The current model offers a method for large-scale autism studies seeking estimates of cognitive ability when standardized psychometric testing is not feasible. LAY SUMMARY: Children with autism who have more severe learning challenges or cognitive impairment have different needs that are important to consider in research studies. When children in our study were missing standardized cognitive testing scores, we were able to use machine learning with other information to correctly \"guess\" when they have cognitive impairment about 80% of the time. We can use this information in research in the future to develop more appropriate treatments for children with autism and cognitive impairment.",

        "Abstract": "Grain boundary velocity has been believed to be correlated to curvature, and this is an important relationship for modeling how polycrystalline materials coarsen during annealing. We determined the velocities and curvatures of approximately 52,000 grain boundaries in a nickel polycrystal using three-dimensional orientation maps measured by high-energy diffraction microscopy before and after annealing at 800\u00b0C. Unexpectedly, the grain boundary velocities and curvatures were uncorrelated. Instead, we found strong correlations between the boundary velocity and the five macroscopic parameters that specify grain boundary crystallography. The sensitivity of the velocity to grain boundary crystallography might be the result of defect-mediated grain boundary migration or the anisotropy of the grain boundary energy. The absence of a correlation between velocity and curvature likely results from the constraints imposed by the grain boundary network and implies the need for a new model for grain boundary migration.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a severe congenital anomaly that is often accompanied by other anomalies. Although the role of genetics in the pathogenesis of CDH has been established, only a small number of disease-associated genes have been identified. To further investigate the genetics of CDH, we analyzed de novo coding variants in 827 proband-parent trios and confirmed an overall significant enrichment of damaging de novo variants, especially in constrained genes. We identified LONP1 (lon peptidase 1, mitochondrial) and ALYREF (Aly/REF export factor) as candidate CDH-associated genes on the basis of de novo variants at a false discovery rate below 0.05. We also performed ultra-rare variant association analyses in 748 affected individuals and 11,220 ancestry-matched population control individuals and identified LONP1 as a risk gene contributing to CDH through both de novo and ultra-rare inherited largely heterozygous variants clustered in the core of the domains and segregating with CDH in affected familial individuals. Approximately 3% of our CDH cohort who are heterozygous with ultra-rare predicted damaging variants in LONP1 have a range of clinical phenotypes, including other anomalies in some individuals and higher mortality and requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Mice with lung epithelium-specific deletion of Lonp1 die immediately after birth, most likely because of the observed severe reduction of lung growth, a known contributor to the high mortality in humans. Our findings of both de novo and inherited rare variants in the same gene may have implications in the design and analysis for other genetic studies of congenital anomalies.",

        "Abstract": "Autism is a highly heritable complex disorder in which de novo mutation (DNM) variation contributes significantly to risk. Using whole-genome sequencing data from 3,474 families, we investigate another source of large-effect risk variation, ultra-rare variants. We report and replicate a transmission disequilibrium of private, likely gene-disruptive (LGD) variants in probands but find that 95% of this burden resides outside of known DNM-enriched genes. This variant class more strongly affects multiplex family probands and supports a multi-hit model for autism. Candidate genes with private LGD variants preferentially transmitted to probands converge on the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, intracellular transport and Erb signaling protein networks. We estimate that these variants are approximately 2.5 generations old and significantly younger than other variants of similar type and frequency in siblings. Overall, private LGD variants are under strong purifying selection and appear to act on a distinct set of genes not yet associated with autism.",

Gene expression signatures of these regions can help elucidate the pathophysiology underlying obesity. RNA sequencing was conducted on P56 C57BL/6NTac male mice and E14.5 C57BL/6NTac embryo punch biopsies in 16 obesity-relevant brain regions. The expression of 190 known obesity-associated genes (monogenic, rare, and low-frequency coding variants; GWAS; syndromic) was analyzed in each anatomical region. Genes associated with these genetic categories of obesity had localized expression patterns across brain regions. Known monogenic obesity causal genes were highly enriched in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and developing hypothalamus. The obesity-associated genes clustered into distinct \"modules\" of similar expression profile, and these were distinct from expression modules formed by similar analysis with genes known to be associated with other disease phenotypes (type 1 and type 2 diabetes, autism, breast cancer) in the same energy balance-relevant brain regions.",

        "Abstract": "Trachea-esophageal defects (TEDs), including esophageal atresia (EA), tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), and laryngeal-tracheoesophageal clefts (LTEC), are a spectrum of life-threatening congenital anomalies in which the trachea and esophagus do not form properly. Up until recently, the developmental basis of these conditions and how the trachea and esophagus arise from a common fetal foregut was poorly understood. However, with significant advances in human genetics, organoids, and animal models, and integrating single cell genomics with high resolution imaging, we are revealing the molecular and cellular mechanisms that orchestrate tracheoesophageal morphogenesis and how disruption in these processes leads to birth defects. Here we review the current understanding of the genetic and developmental basis of TEDs. We suggest future opportunities for integrating developmental mechanisms elucidated from animals and organoids with human genetics and clinical data to gain insight into the genotype-phenotype basis of these heterogeneous birth defects. Finally, we envision how this will enhance diagnosis, improve treatment, and perhaps one day, lead to new tissue replacement therapy.",

The rate of gene discovery far outpaces our understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations, with clinical characterization remaining a bottleneck for understanding NDDs. Most disease-associated Mendelian genes are members of gene families, and we hypothesize that those with related molecular function share clinical presentations.",

        "Abstract": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) can rapidly produce interferons and other soluble factors in response to extracellular viruses or virus mimics such as CpG-containing DNA. pDCs can also recognize live cells infected with certain RNA viruses, but the relevance and functional consequences of such recognition remain unclear. We studied the response of primary DCs to the prototypical persistent DNA virus, human cytomegalovirus (CMV). Human pDCs produced high amounts of type I interferon (IFN-I) when incubated with live CMV-infected fibroblasts but not with free CMV; the response involved integrin-mediated adhesion, transfer of DNA-containing virions to pDCs, and the recognition of DNA through TLR9. Compared with transient polyfunctional responses to CpG or free influenza virus, pDC response to CMV-infected cells was long-lasting, dominated by the production of IFN-I and IFN-III, and lacked diversification into functionally distinct populations. Similarly, pDC activation by influenza-infected lung epithelial cells was highly efficient, prolonged, and dominated by interferon production. Prolonged pDC activation by CMV-infected cells facilitated the activation of natural killer cells critical for CMV control. Last, patients with CMV viremia harbored phenotypically activated pDCs and increased circulating IFN-I and IFN-III. Thus, recognition of live infected cells is a mechanism of virus detection by pDCs that elicits a unique antiviral immune response.",

        "Abstract": "In humans receiving intestinal transplantation (ITx), long-term multilineage blood chimerism often develops. Donor T cell macrochimerism (\u22654%) frequently occurs without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and is associated with reduced rejection. Here we demonstrate that patients with macrochimerism had high graft-versus-host (GvH) to host-versus-graft (HvG) T cell clonal ratios in their allografts. These GvH clones entered the circulation, where their peak levels were associated with declines in HvG clones early after transplant, suggesting that GvH reactions may contribute to chimerism and control HvG responses without causing GVHD. Consistently, donor-derived T cells, including GvH clones, and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were simultaneously detected in the recipients' BM more than 100 days after transplant. Individual GvH clones appeared in ileal mucosa or PBMCs before detection in recipient BM, consistent with an intestinal mucosal origin, where donor GvH-reactive T cells expanded early upon entry of recipient APCs into the graft. These results, combined with cytotoxic single-cell transcriptional profiles of donor T cells in recipient BM, suggest that tissue-resident GvH-reactive donor T cells migrated into the recipient circulation and BM, where they destroyed recipient hematopoietic cells through cytolytic effector functions and promoted engraftment of graft-derived HSPCs that maintain chimerism. These mechanisms suggest an approach to achieving intestinal allograft tolerance.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in DNA damage response (DDR) genes endanger genome integrity and predispose to cancer and genetic disorders. Here, using CRISPR-dependent cytosine base editing screens, we identify > 2,000 sgRNAs that generate nucleotide variants in 86 DDR genes, resulting in altered cellular fitness upon DNA damage. Among those variants, we discover loss- and gain-of-function mutants in the Tudor domain of the DDR regulator 53BP1 that define a non-canonical surface required for binding the deubiquitinase USP28. Moreover, we characterize variants of the TRAIP ubiquitin ligase that define a domain, whose loss renders cells resistant to topoisomerase I inhibition. Finally, we identify mutations in the ATM kinase with opposing genome stability phenotypes and loss-of-function mutations in the CHK2 kinase previously categorized as variants of uncertain significance for breast cancer. We anticipate that this resource will enable the discovery of additional DDR gene functions and expedite studies of DDR variants in human disease.",

        "Abstract": "Functional genomic approaches have facilitated the discovery of rare genetic disorders and improved efforts to decipher their underlying etiology. PPP2R5D-related disorder is an early childhood onset condition characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia, autism-spectrum disorder, macrocephaly, and dysmorphic features. The disorder is caused by de novo single nucleotide changes in PPP2R5D, which generate heterozygous dominant missense variants. PPP2R5D is known to encode a B'-type (B'56\u03b4) regulatory subunit of a PP2A-serine/threonine phosphatase. To help elucidate the molecular mechanisms altered in PPP2R5D-related disorder, we used a CRISPR-single-base editor to generate HEK-293 cells in which a single transition (c.1258G>A) was introduced into one allele, precisely recapitulating a clinically relevant E420K variant. Unbiased quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of endogenously expressed proteins revealed heterozygous-dominant changes in kinase/phosphatase signaling. These data combined with orthogonal validation studies revealed a previously unrecognized interaction of PPP2R5D with AKT in human cells, leading to constitutively active AKT-mTOR signaling, increased cell size, and uncoordinated cellular growth in E420K-variant cells. Rapamycin reduced cell size and dose-dependently reduced RPS6 phosphorylation in E420K-variant cells, suggesting that inhibition of mTOR1 can suppress both the observed RPS6 hyperphosphorylation and increased cell size. Together, our findings provide a deeper understanding of PPP2R5D and insight into how the E420K-variant alters signaling networks influenced by PPP2R5D. Our comprehensive approach, which combines precise genome editing, isobaric tandem mass tag labeling of peptides generated from endogenously expressed proteins, and concurrent liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS",

Previously published prediction methods have facilitated the interpretation of missense variants but have limited performance. Here, we describe MVP (Missense Variant Pathogenicity prediction), a new prediction method that uses deep residual network to leverage large training data sets and many correlated predictors. We train the model separately in genes that are intolerant of loss of function variants and the ones that are tolerant in order to take account of potentially different genetic effect size and mode of action. We compile cancer mutation hotspots and de novo variants from developmental disorders for benchmarking. Overall, MVP achieves better performance in prioritizing pathogenic missense variants than previous methods, especially in genes tolerant of loss of function variants. Finally, using MVP, we estimate that de novo coding variants contribute to 7.8% of isolated congenital heart disease, nearly doubling previous estimates.",

        "Abstract": "The diaphragm is critical for respiration and separation of the thoracic and abdominal cavities, and defects in diaphragm development are the cause of congenital diaphragmatic hernias (CDH), a common and often lethal birth defect. The genetic etiology of CDH is complex. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels), and structural variants (SVs) in more than 150 genes have been associated with CDH, although few genes are recurrently mutated in multiple individuals and mutated genes are incompletely penetrant. This suggests that multiple genetic variants in combination, other not-yet-investigated classes of variants, and/or nongenetic factors contribute to CDH etiology. However, no studies have comprehensively investigated in affected individuals the contribution of all possible classes of variants throughout the genome to CDH etiology. In our study, we used a unique cohort of four individuals with isolated CDH with samples from blood, skin, and diaphragm connective tissue and parental blood and deep whole-genome sequencing to assess germline and somatic ",

        "Abstract": "Most genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) were identified with an excess of de novo mutations (DNMs) but the significance in case-control mutation burden analysis is unestablished. Here, we sequence 63 genes in 16,294 NDD cases and an additional 62 genes in 6,211 NDD cases. By combining these with published data, we assess a total of 125 genes in over 16,000 NDD cases and compare the mutation burden to nonpsychiatric controls from ExAC. We identify 48 genes (25 newly reported) showing significant burden of ultra-rare (MAF\u2009<\u20090.01%) gene-disruptive mutations (FDR 5%), six of which reach family-wise error rate (FWER) significance (p\u2009<\u20091.25E-06). Among these 125 targeted genes, we also reevaluate DNM excess in 17,426 NDD trios with 6,499 new autism trios. We identify 90 genes enriched for DNMs (FDR 5%; e.g., GABRG2 and UIMC1); of which, 61 reach FWER significance (p\u2009<\u20093.64E-07; e.g., CASZ1). In addition to doubling the number of patients for many NDD risk genes, we present phenotype-genotype correlations for seven risk genes (CTCF, HNRNPU, KCNQ3, ZBTB18, TCF12, SPEN, and LEO1) based on this large-scale targeted sequencing effort.",

        "Abstract": "There is growing evidence for the advantages of synthesizing nanosized zeolites with markedly reduced internal diffusion limitations for enhanced performances in catalysis and adsorption. Producing zeolite crystals with sizes less than 100\u2009nm, however, is non-trivial, often requires the use of complex organics and typically results in a small product yield. Here we present an alternative, facile approach to enhance the mass-transport properties of zeolites by the epitaxial growth of fin-like protrusions on seed crystals. We validate this generalizable methodology on two common zeolites and confirm that fins are in crystallographic registry with the underlying seeds, and that secondary growth does not impede access to the micropores. Molecular modelling and time-resolved titration experiments of finned zeolites probe internal diffusion and reveal substantial improvements in mass transport, consistent with catalytic tests of a model reaction, which show that these structures behave as pseudo-nanocrystals with sizes commensurate to that of the fin. This approach could be extended to the rational synthesis of other zeolite and aluminosilicate materials.",

        "Abstract": "Although human B cells have been extensively studied, most reports have used peripheral blood as a source. Here, we used a unique tissue resource derived from healthy organ donors to deeply characterize human B-cell compartments across multiple tissues and donors. These datasets revealed that B cells in the blood are not in homeostasis with compartments in other tissues. We found striking donor-to-donor variability in the frequencies and isotype of CD27+ memory B cells (MBCs). A comprehensive antibody-based screen revealed markers of MBC and allowed identification of novel MBC subsets with distinct functions defined according to surface expression of CD69 and CD45RB. We defined a tissue-resident MBC phenotype that was predominant in the gut but absent in blood. RNA-sequencing of MBC subsets from multiple tissues revealed a tissue-resident MBC gene signature as well as gut- and spleen-specific signatures. Overall, these studies provide novel insights into the nature and function of human B-cell compartments across multiple tissues.",

        "Abstract": "The various malformations of the aerodigestive tract collectively known as esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) constitute a rare group of birth defects of largely unknown etiology. Previous studies have identified a small number of rare genetic variants causing syndromes associated with EA/TEF. We performed a pilot exome sequencing study of 45 unrelated simplex trios (probands and parents) with EA/TEF. Thirteen had isolated and 32 had nonisolated EA/TEF; none had a family history of EA/TEF. We identified de novo variants in protein-coding regions, including 19 missense variants predicted to be deleterious (D-mis) and 3 likely gene-disrupting (LGD) variants. Consistent with previous studies of structural birth defects, there is a trend of increased burden of de novo D-mis in cases (1.57-fold increase over the background mutation rate), and the burden is greater in constrained genes (2.55-fold, p\u2009=\u20090.003). There is a frameshift de novo variant in EFTUD2, a known EA/TEF risk gene involved in mRNA splicing. Strikingly, 15 out of 19 de novo D-mis variants are located in genes that are putative target genes of EFTUD2 or SOX2 (another known EA/TEF gene), much greater than expected by chance (3.34-fold, p value\u2009=\u20097.20e-5). We estimated that 33% of patients can be attributed to de novo deleterious variants in known and novel genes. We identified APC2, AMER3, PCDH1, GTF3C1, POLR2B, RAB3GAP2, and ITSN1 as plausible candidate genes in the etiology of EA/TEF. We conclude that further genomic analysis to identify de novo variants will likely identify previously undescribed genetic causes of EA/TEF.",

Our previous studies indicated that imidazole arctigenin derivatives possessed antiviral activities against aquatic rhabdoviruses. Based on the data of structure-activity relationship, a new imidazole arctigenin derivative, 4-(8-(2-bromoimidazole)octyloxy)-arctigenin (BOA), was designed and synthesized. And its antiviral activities against aquatic rhabdoviruses (SVCV, IHNV and MSRV) were evaluated in vitro. By comparing inhibitory concentration at half-maximal activity (IC ",

Participants were 78.4% male, 47.3% had intellectual disability, and 32.1% had persistent language impairments. Childhood language disorders (59.7%), speech/articulation problems (32.8%), sleep (39.4%) and eating problems (29.4%), motor delays (22.8%) and history of seizure (15.5%) were the most frequently reported clinical features. Over two thirds (67.2%) had been diagnosed with at least one psychiatric disorder (anxiety disorders: 41.1%; ADHD: 38.7%). Compared to verbally fluent participants, those with language impairments had lower frequencies of almost all psychiatric disorders. Female sex and older age were associated with higher medical and psychiatric morbidity.",

        "Abstract": "Immune responses in diverse tissue sites are critical for protective immunity and homeostasis. Here, we investigate how tissue localization regulates the development and function of human natural killer (NK) cells, innate lymphocytes important for anti-viral and tumor immunity. Integrating high-dimensional analysis of NK cells from blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissue sites from 60 individuals, we identify tissue-specific patterns of NK cell subset distribution, maturation, and function maintained across age and between individuals. Mature and terminally differentiated NK cells with enhanced effector function predominate in blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lungs and exhibit shared transcriptional programs across sites. By contrast, precursor and immature NK cells with reduced effector capacity populate lymph nodes and intestines and exhibit tissue-resident signatures and site-specific adaptations. Together, our results reveal anatomic control of NK cell development and maintenance as tissue-resident populations, whereas mature, terminally differentiated subsets mediate immunosurveillance through diverse peripheral sites.

        "Abstract": "Single-cell proteomics can provide unique insights into biological processes by resolving heterogeneity that is obscured by bulk measurements. Gains in the overall sensitivity and proteome coverage through improvements in sample processing and analysis increase the information content obtained from each cell, particularly for less abundant proteins. Here we report on improved single-cell proteome coverage through the combination of the previously developed\u00a0nanoPOTS platform with further miniaturization of liquid chromatography (LC) separations and implementation of an ultrasensitive latest generation mass spectrometer. Following nanoPOTS sample preparation, protein digests from single cells were separated using a 20 \u03bcm i.d. in-house-packed nanoLC column. Separated peptides were ionized using an etched fused-silica emitter capable of stable operation at the \u223c20 nL/min flow rate provided by the LC separation. Ultrasensitive LC-MS analysis was achieved using the Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer. An average of 362 protein groups were identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) from single HeLa cells, and 874 protein groups were identified using the Match Between Runs feature of MaxQuant. This represents an >70% increase in label-free proteome coverage for single cells relative to previous efforts using larger bore (30 \u03bcm i.d.) LC columns coupled to a previous-generation Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer.",

The rational design of these OSDAs often entails the identification of molecules with a geometry that is commensurate with the channels and cages of the target zeolite structure. Syntheses tend to employ only a single OSDA, but there are a few examples where two or more organics operate synergistically to yield a desired product. Using a combination of state-of-the-art characterization techniques and molecular modeling, we show that the coupling of ",

        "Abstract": "The genetic architecture of sporadic congenital heart disease (CHD) is characterized by enrichment in damaging de novo variants in chromatin-modifying genes. To test the hypothesis that gene pathways contributing to de novo forms of CHD are distinct from those for recessive forms, we analyze 2391 whole-exome trios from the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium. We deploy a permutation-based gene-burden analysis to identify damaging recessive and compound heterozygous genotypes and disease genes, controlling for confounding effects, such as background mutation rate and ancestry. Cilia-related genes are significantly enriched for damaging rare recessive genotypes, but comparatively depleted for de novo variants. The opposite trend is observed for chromatin-modifying genes. Other cardiac developmental gene classes have less stratification by mode of inheritance than cilia and chromatin-modifying gene classes. Our analyses reveal dominant and recessive CHD are associated with distinct gene functions, with cilia-related genes providing a reservoir of rare segregating variation leading to CHD.",

        "Title": "Deletion of donor-reactive T cell clones after human liver transplant.",
        "Abstract": "We recently developed a high throughput T cell receptor \u03b2 chain (TCR\u03b2) sequencing-based approach to identifying and tracking donor-reactive T cells. To address the role of clonal deletion in liver allograft tolerance, we applied this method in samples from a recent randomized study, ITN030ST, in which immunosuppression withdrawal was attempted within 2\u00a0years of liver transplantation. We identified donor-reactive T cell clones via TCR\u03b2 sequencing following a pre-transplant mixed lymphocyte reaction and tracked these clones in the circulation following transplantation in 3 tolerant and 5 non-tolerant subjects. All subjects showed a downward trend and significant reductions in donor-reactive TCR\u03b2 sequences were detected post-transplant in 6 of 8 subjects, including 2 tolerant and 4 non-tolerant recipients. Reductions in donor-reactive TCR\u03b2 sequences were greater than those of all other TCR\u03b2 sequences, including 3rd party-reactive sequences, in all 8 subjects, demonstrating an impact of the liver allograft after accounting for repertoire turnover. Although limited by patient number and heterogeneity, our results suggest that partial deletion of donor-reactive T cell clones may be a consequence of liver transplantation and does not correlate with success or failure of early immunosuppression withdrawal. These observations underscore the organ- and/or protocol-specific nature of tolerance mechanisms in humans.",

In this paper, we evaluate the use of genomic test reports ordered for cancer patients in order to derive cancer subtypes and to identify biological pathways predictive of poor survival outcomes. A novel method is proposed to calculate patient similarity based on affected biological pathways rather than gene mutations. We demonstrate that this approach identifies subtypes of prognostic value and biological pathways linked to survival, with implications for precision treatment selection and a better understanding of the underlying disease. We also share lessons learned regarding the opportunities and challenges of secondary use of observational genomic data to conduct such research.",

However, anti-IHNV drugs currently are scarce. For the purpose of seeking out anti-IHNV drugs, the anti-IHNV activities of 32 medicinal plants were investigated by using epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells. Among these plants, Prunella vulgaris L. (PVL) showed the strongest inhibition on IHNV replication with an inhibitory percentage of 99.3% at the concentration 100\u202fmg/L.

However, significantly larger sample sizes are needed to identify the complete set of genetic risk factors. We conducted a pilot study for SPARK (SPARKForAutism.org) of 457 families with ASD, all consented online. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and genotyping data were generated for each family using DNA from saliva. We identified variants in genes and loci that are clinically recognized causes or significant contributors to ASD in 10.4% of families without previous genetic findings. In addition, we identified variants that are possibly associated with ASD in an additional 3.4% of families. A meta-analysis using the TADA framework at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1 provides statistical support for 26 ASD risk genes. While most of these genes are already known ASD risk genes, ",

        "Abstract": "We report a novel technical approach for subcritical fluid extraction (SFE) for organic matter characterization in complex matrices such as soil. The custom platform combines on-line SFE with micro-solid phase extraction, nano liquid chromatography (LC), electrospray ionization and Fourier transform mass spectrometry (SFE-LC-FTMS). We demonstrated the utility of SFE-LC-FTMS, including results from both Orbitrap and FTICR MS, for analysis of complex mixtures of organic compounds in a solid matrix by characterizing soil organic matter in peat, a high-carbon soil. For example, in a single experiment, >6000 molecular formulas can be assigned based upon FTICR MS data from 1-50 \u03bcL of soil samples (roughly 1-50 mg of soil, dependent on soil density), nearly twice that typically obtained from direct infusion liquid solvent extraction (LSE) from an order of magnitude larger volume of the same soil. The detected species consisted predominately of lipid-like, lignin-like and protein-like compounds, based on their O/C and H/C ratios, with predominantly CHO and CHONP molecular compositions. These results clearly demonstrate that SFE has the potential to effectively extract a variety of molecular species and could become an important member of a suite of extraction methods for studying SOM and other natural organic matter. This is especially true when comprehensive coverage, minimal sample volumes, and high sensitivity are required, or when the presence of organic solvent residue in residual soil is problematic. The SFE based extraction protocol could potentially enable spatially resolved characterization of organic matter in soil with a resolution of \u223c1 mm3 to facilitate studies probing the spatial heterogeneity of soil.",

        "Abstract": "We investigated human T-cell repertoire formation using high throughput TCR\u03b2 CDR3 sequencing in immunodeficient mice receiving human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and human thymus grafts. Replicate humanized mice generated diverse and highly divergent repertoires. Repertoire narrowing and increased CDR3\u03b2 sharing was observed during thymocyte selection. While hydrophobicity analysis implicated self-peptides in positive selection of the overall repertoire, positive selection favored shorter shared sequences that had reduced hydrophobicity at positions 6 and 7 of CDR3\u03b2s, suggesting weaker interactions with self-peptides than unshared sequences, possibly allowing escape from negative selection. Sharing was similar between autologous and allogeneic thymi and occurred between different cell subsets. Shared sequences were enriched for allo-crossreactive CDR3\u03b2s and for Type 1 diabetes-associated autoreactive CDR3\u03b2s. Single-cell TCR-sequencing showed increased sharing of CDR3\u03b1s compared to CDR3\u03b2s between mice. Our data collectively implicate preferential positive selection for shared human CDR3\u03b2s that are highly cross-reactive. While previous studies suggested a role for recombination bias in producing \"public\" sequences in mice, our study is the first to demonstrate a role for thymic selection. Our results implicate positive selection for promiscuous TCR\u03b2 sequences that likely evade negative selection, due to their low affinity for self-ligands, in the abundance of \"public\" human TCR\u03b2 sequences.",

        "Title": "Recessive Rare Variants in Deoxyhypusine Synthase, an Enzyme Involved in the Synthesis of Hypusine, Are Associated with a Neurodevelopmental Disorder.",
        "Abstract": "Hypusine is formed post-translationally from lysine and is found in a single cellular protein, eukaryotic translation initiation factor-5A (eIF5A), and its homolog eIF5A2. Biosynthesis of hypusine is a two-step reaction involving the enzymes deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). eIF5A is highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution and plays a role in mRNA translation, cellular proliferation, cellular differentiation, and inflammation. DHPS is also highly conserved and is essential for life, as Dhps-null mice are embryonic lethal. Using exome sequencing, we identified rare biallelic, recurrent, predicted likely pathogenic variants in DHPS segregating with disease in five affected individuals from four unrelated families. These individuals have similar neurodevelopmental features that include global developmental delay and seizures. Two of four affected females have short stature. All five affected individuals share a recurrent missense variant (c.518A>G [p.Asn173Ser]) in trans with a likely gene disrupting variant (c.1014+1G>A, c.912_917delTTACAT [p.Tyr305_Ile306del], or c.1A>G [p.Met1?]). cDNA studies demonstrated that the c.1014+1G>A variant causes aberrant splicing. Recombinant DHPS enzyme harboring either the p.Asn173Ser or p.Tyr305_Ile306del variant showed reduced (20%) or absent in\u00a0vitro activity, respectively. We co-transfected constructs overexpressing HA-tagged DHPS (wild-type or mutant) and GFP-tagged eIF5A into HEK293T cells to determine the effect of these variants on hypusine biosynthesis and observed that the p.Tyr305_Ile306del and p.Asn173Ser variants resulted in reduced hypusination of eIF5A compared to wild-type DHPS enzyme. Our data suggest that rare biallelic variants in DHPS result in reduced enzyme activity that limits the hypusination of eIF5A and are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder.",

        "Title": "De novo variants in congenital diaphragmatic hernia identify MYRF as a new syndrome and reveal genetic overlaps with other developmental disorders.",
        "Abstract": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a severe birth defect that is often accompanied by other congenital anomalies. Previous exome sequencing studies for CDH have supported a role of de novo damaging variants but did not identify any recurrently mutated genes. To investigate further the genetics of CDH, we analyzed de novo coding variants in 362 proband-parent trios including 271 new trios reported in this study. We identified four unrelated individuals with damaging de novo variants in MYRF (P = 5.3x10(-8)), including one likely gene-disrupting (LGD) and three deleterious missense (D-mis) variants. Eight additional individuals with de novo LGD or missense variants were identified from our other genetic studies or from the literature. Common phenotypes of MYRF de novo variant carriers include CDH, congenital heart disease and genitourinary abnormalities, suggesting that it represents a novel syndrome. MYRF is a membrane associated transcriptional factor highly expressed in developing diaphragm and is depleted of LGD variants in the general population. All de novo missense variants aggregated in two functional protein domains. Analyzing the transcriptome of patient-derived diaphragm fibroblast cells suggest that disease associated variants abolish the transcription factor activity. Furthermore, we showed that the remaining genes with damaging variants in CDH significantly overlap with genes implicated in other developmental disorders. Gene expression patterns and patient phenotypes support pleiotropic effects of damaging variants in these genes on CDH and other developmental disorders. Finally, functional enrichment analysis implicates the disruption of regulation of gene expression, kinase activities, intra-cellular signaling, and cytoskeleton organization as pathogenic mechanisms in CDH.",

        "Abstract": "Human intestinal transplantation often results in long-term mixed chimerism of donor and recipient blood in transplant patients. We followed the phenotypes of chimeric peripheral blood cells in 21 patients receiving intestinal allografts over 5 years. Donor lymphocyte phenotypes suggested a contribution of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from the graft. Surprisingly, we detected donor-derived HSPCs in intestinal mucosa, Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver. Human gut HSPCs are phenotypically similar to bone marrow HSPCs and have multilineage differentiation potential in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Analysis of circulating post-transplant donor T\u00a0cells suggests that they undergo selection in recipient lymphoid organs to acquire immune tolerance. Our longitudinal study of human HSPCs carried in intestinal allografts demonstrates their turnover kinetics and gradual replacement of donor-derived HSPCs from a circulating pool. Thus, we have demonstrated the existence of\u00a0functioning HSPCs in human intestines with implications for promoting tolerance in transplant recipients.",

        "Title": "Early expansion of donor-specific Tregs in tolerant kidney transplant recipients.",
        "Abstract": "Allograft tolerance, in which a graft is accepted without long-term immunosuppression, could overcome numerous obstacles in transplantation. Human allograft tolerance has been intentionally induced across HLA barriers via combined kidney and bone marrow transplantation (CKBMT) with a regimen that induces only transient chimerism. Tregs are enriched early after CKBMT. While deletional tolerance contributes to long-term tolerance, the role of Tregs remains unclear. We have optimized a method for identifying the donor-specific Treg repertoire and used it to interrogate the fate of donor-specific Tregs after CKBMT. We expanded Tregs with several different protocols. Using functional analyses and T cell receptor sequencing, we found that expanding sorted Tregs with activated donor B cells identified the broadest Treg repertoire with the greatest potency and donor specificity of suppression. This method outperformed both alloantigen stimulation with CTLA4Ig and sequencing of CFSElo cells from the primary mixed lymphocyte reaction. In 3 tolerant and 1 nontolerant CKBMT recipients, we sequenced donor-specific Tregs before transplant and tracked them after transplant. Preexisting donor-specific Tregs were expanded at 6 months after CKBMT in tolerant patients and were reduced in the nontolerant patient. These results suggest that early expansion of donor-specific Tregs is involved in tolerance induction following CKBMT.",

        "Abstract": "Coumarin forms an elite class of naturally occurring compounds that possess promising antiviral therapeutic perspectives. In the previous study, we designed and synthesized a coumarin derivative, 7-(4-benzimidazole-butoxy)-coumarin (BBC), to evaluate its antiviral activity on spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV). In this study, our results show that BBC does not affect viral adhesion and delivery from endosomes to the cytosol, indicating BBC has no inhibitory activity in the early stage of viral infection. Further data are determined that BBC significantly declines SVCV-infected apoptosis and recovers caspase-3/8/9 activity. To reveal the pathway that affects Nrf2 translocation by BBC, we examine changes in protein kinase C (PKC) in EPC cells treated with BBC. We observe that BBC results in a higher phosphorylation of PKC\u03b1/\u03b2 that is involved in the activation of erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) phosphorylation to favor Nrf2 translocation to nucleus at 24 and 48\u202fh. In addition, the results show that BBC also up-regulates both antiviral responses, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and cellular IFN response. Overall, this mechanism of action provides a new therapeutic target for the treatment of SVCV infection, and these results suggest that treatment with BBC is effective in reducing SVCV infection and differently regulates SVCV-induced undesirable conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Coumarin forms an elite class of naturally occurring compounds that possess promising antiviral therapeutic perspectives. In this study, a coumarin derivative 7-[6-(2-methylimidazole) hexyloxy] coumarin (D5) was designed and synthesized to evaluate antiviral activity on a rhabdovirus, spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV). Our results demonstrated that D5 had a robust antiviral activity with >90% inhibitory rate of SVCV expression in the host cells. And D5 significantly reduced viral-induced apoptosis and recovered virus-activated caspase-3/8/9 activities. Further data determined that SVCV could alter the cytoskeletal structure of EPC cells, characterized by a circumferential ring of microtubules and a disrupted microfilament organization, whereas cytoskeleton structure in D5-treated cells kept the normal morphology. Mechanistically speaking, D5 could interfere with SVCV replication inside or outside of cells through two different approaches. Before the process of virus entry into EPC cells, D5 had an impact on SVCV glycoprotein structure so as to disrupt viral binding to the cell surface or translocation to the cytosol. Another strategy for D5 to against SVCV was that D5 significantly suppressed SVCV-activated autophagy, which was beneficial for the host cells to restrict SVCV viral replication, accompanied by a higher phosphorylation of Akt-mTOR. In summary, our results revealed that D5 was effective in weakening SVCV infection and regulating SVCV-induced undesirable conditions, and this compound provided new therapeutic implications for the treatment of rhabdoviruses.",

        "Abstract": "Alloreactive T lymphocytes are the primary mediators of immune responses in transplantation, both in the graft-versus-host and host-versus-graft directions. While essentially all clones comprising the human T cell repertoire have been selected on self-peptide presented by self-human leukocyte antigens (self-HLAs), much remains to be understood about the nature of clones capable of responding to allo-HLA molecules. Quantitative tools to study these cells are critical to understand fundamental features of this important response; however, the large size and diversity of the alloreactive T cell repertoire in humans presents a great technical challenge. We have developed a high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing approach to characterize the human alloresponse. We present a statistical method to model T cell clonal frequency distribution and quantify repertoire diversity. Using these approaches, we measured the diversity and frequency of distinct alloreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations in HLA-mismatched responder-stimulator pairs. Our findings indicate that the alloimmune repertoire is highly specific for a given pair of individuals, that most alloreactive clones circulate at low frequencies, and that a high proportion of TCRs is likely able to recognize alloantigens.",

        "Abstract": "Current mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics approaches are ineffective for mapping protein expression in tissue sections with high spatial resolution because of the limited overall sensitivity of conventional workflows. Here we report an integrated and automated method to advance spatially resolved proteomics by seamlessly coupling laser capture microdissection (LCM) with a recently developed nanoliter-scale sample preparation system termed nanoPOTS (Nanodroplet Processing in One pot for Trace Samples). The workflow is enabled by prepopulating nanowells with DMSO, which serves as a sacrificial capture liquid for microdissected tissues. The DMSO droplets efficiently collect laser-pressure catapulted LCM tissues as small as 20 \u03bcm in diameter with success rates >87%. We also demonstrate that tissue treatment with DMSO can significantly improve proteome coverage, likely due to its ability to dissolve lipids from tissue and enhance protein extraction efficiency. The LCM-nanoPOTS platform was able to identify 180, 695, and 1827 protein groups on average from 12-\u03bcm-thick rat brain cortex tissue sections having diameters of 50, 100, and 200 \u03bcm, respectively. We also analyzed 100-\u03bcm-diameter sections corresponding to 10-18 cells from three different regions of rat brain and comparatively quantified \u223c1000 proteins, demonstrating the potential utility for high-resolution spatially resolved mapping of protein expression in tissues.",

        "Abstract": "Haploinsufficiency is a major mechanism of genetic risk in developmental disorders. Accurate prediction of haploinsufficient genes is essential for prioritizing and interpreting deleterious variants in genetic studies. Current methods based on mutation intolerance in population data suffer from inadequate power for genes with short transcripts. Here we show haploinsufficiency is strongly associated with epigenomic patterns, and develop a computational method (Episcore) to predict haploinsufficiency leveraging epigenomic data from a broad range of tissue and cell types by machine learning methods. Based on data from recent exome sequencing studies on developmental disorders, Episcore achieves better performance in prioritizing likely-gene-disrupting (LGD) de novo variants than current methods. We further show that Episcore is less-biased by gene size, and complementary to mutation intolerance metrics for prioritizing LGD variants. Our approach enables new applications of epigenomic data and facilitates discovery and interpretation of novel risk variants implicated in developmental disorders.",

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was employed to deposit cells into a newly developed nanodroplet sample processing chip, after which samples were analyzed by ultrasensitive nanoLC-MS. An average of circa 670 protein groups were confidently identified from single HeLa cells, which is a far greater level of proteome coverage for single cells than has been previously reported. We demonstrate that the single-cell proteomics platform can be used to differentiate cell types from enzyme-dissociated human lung primary cells and identify specific protein markers for epithelial and mesenchymal cells.",

Although methods have been developed to evaluate high-dimensional transcriptomic and proteomic data (relating to cellular mRNA and protein), there has not been a method to evaluate corresponding high-dimensional functionomic data (relating to cellular functions) from single cells. Here, we present a protocol to quantitatively measure the differentiation potentials of single human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and then cluster the cells according to these measurements. High dimensional functionomic analysis of cell potential allows cell function to be linked to molecular mechanisms within the same progenitor population.",

        "Abstract": "Nanoscale or single-cell technologies are critical for biomedical applications. However, current mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic approaches require samples comprising a minimum of thousands of cells to provide in-depth profiling. Here, we report the development of a nanoPOTS (nanodroplet processing in one pot for trace samples) platform for small cell population proteomics analysis. NanoPOTS enhances the efficiency and recovery of sample processing by downscaling processing volumes to <200\u2009nL to minimize surface losses. When combined with ultrasensitive liquid chromatography-MS, nanoPOTS allows identification of ~1500 to ~3000 proteins from ~10 to ~140 cells, respectively. By incorporating the Match Between Runs algorithm of MaxQuant, >3000 proteins are consistently identified from as few as 10 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate quantification of ~2400 proteins from single human pancreatic islet thin sections from type 1 diabetic and control donors, illustrating the application of nanoPOTS for spatially resolved proteome measurements from clinical tissues.",

        "Abstract": "Mosaicism due to somatic mutations can cause multiple diseases including cancer, developmental and overgrowth syndromes, neurodevelopmental disorders, autoinflammatory diseases, and atrial fibrillation. With the increased use of next generation sequencing technology, multiple tools have been developed to identify low-frequency variants, specifically from matched tumor-normal tissues in cancer studies. To investigate whether mosaic variants are implicated in congenital heart disease (CHD), we developed a pipeline using the cancer somatic variant caller MuTect to identify mosaic variants in whole-exome sequencing (WES) data from a cohort of parent/affected child trios (n\u00a0=\u00a0715) and a cohort of healthy individuals (n\u00a0=\u00a0416). This is a novel application of the somatic variant caller designed for cancer to WES trio data. We identified two cases with mosaic KMT2D mutations that are likely pathogenic for CHD, but conclude that, overall, mosaicism detectable in peripheral blood or saliva does not account for a significant portion of CHD etiology.",

        "Abstract": "Emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria causes an urgent need for new generation of antibiotics, which may have a different mechanism of inhibition or killing action from the existing. Here, we report on the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of thirty-nine coumarin derivatives in order to solve the antibacterial resistance by targeting at the inhibition of biosynthesis pathway of fatty acids. Their antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Flavobacterium cloumnare are tested and action mechanism against the key enzyme in bacterial fatty acid synthesis pathway are studied. The results show that compounds 13 and 18 have potent and broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. In addition, 9, 14 and 19 show eminent antimicrobial efficacy toward S.\u00a0aureus, S.\u00a0agalactiae, and F.\u00a0cloumnare. Mechanistically, coumarin derivatives display the antibacterial activity via the control of FabI and FabK function. The structure-activity relationship analysis indicate that the length of linker and imidazole substitute group could significantly influence the antimicrobial activity, as well as the inhibitory activity against FabI and FabK. The structural optimization analysis of coumarin suggest that derivatives 9, 13, 14, 18 and 19 could be a viable way of preventing and controlling bacteria and considered as promising lead compounds for the development of commercial drugs.",

A Compound Identification Algorithm (CIA) was previously developed for automated elemental formula assignment for natural organic matter (NOM). In this work, we describe software Formularity with a user-friendly interface for CIA function and newly developed search function Isotopic Pattern Algorithm (IPA). While CIA assigns elemental formulas for compounds containing C, H, O, N, S, and P, IPA is capable of assigning formulas for compounds containing other elements. We used halogenated organic compounds (HOC), a chemical class that is ubiquitous in nature as well as anthropogenic systems, as an example to demonstrate the capability of Formularity with IPA. A HOC standard mix was used to evaluate the identification confidence of IPA. Tap water and HOC spike in Suwannee River NOM were used to assess HOC identification in complex environmental samples. Strategies for reconciliation of CIA and IPA assignments were discussed. Software and sample databases with documentation are freely available.",

        "Abstract": "Developing new zeolite catalysts for (petro)chemical applications is nontrivial owing to challenges that include the identification of commercially-viable syntheses. The vast majority of syntheses require the use of an organic structure-directing agent (OSDA), which has economic and environmental shortcomings. In the search for alternative zeolites to common industrial catalysts, such as ZSM-5 (MFI), a promising candidate is ZSM-11 (MEL), a close structural analogue of MFI. ZSM-11 is comprised of 3-dimensional straight channels that have less diffusion limitations than MFI. Side-by-side comparisons of ZSM-11 and ZSM-5 catalysts reveal the former exhibits significantly longer time-on-stream lifetime in many reactions; however, there are several difficulties associated with the preparation of ZSM-11, which include the ability to identify inexpensive OSDAs that produce small crystals in high yield. Here, we examine ZSM-11 synthesis using 1,8-diaminooctane (DAO), which produces ZSM-11 crystals with sizes of ca. 300\u2005nm. We demonstrate that the use of MEL seeds allows for an order of magnitude reduction in the quantity of DAO without sacrificing crystal purity or yield (>80\u2009%). Catalytic tests using methanol to hydrocarbons as a representative reaction show that H-ZSM-11 lifetime and selectivity are similar for samples prepared with and without seeds. Collectively our findings highlight an efficient method to produce ZSM-11 as a potential alternative to ZSM-5 for catalytic applications.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of mortality from birth defects. Here, exome sequencing of a single cohort of 2,871 CHD probands, including 2,645 parent-offspring trios, implicated rare inherited mutations in 1.8%, including a recessive founder mutation in GDF1 accounting for \u223c5% of severe CHD in Ashkenazim, recessive genotypes in MYH6 accounting for \u223c11% of Shone complex, and dominant FLT4 mutations accounting for 2.3% of Tetralogy of Fallot. De novo mutations (DNMs) accounted for 8% of cases, including \u223c3% of isolated CHD patients and \u223c28% with both neurodevelopmental and extra-cardiac congenital anomalies. Seven genes surpassed thresholds for genome-wide significance, and 12 genes not previously implicated in CHD had >70% probability of being disease related. DNMs in \u223c440 genes were inferred to contribute to CHD. Striking overlap between genes with damaging DNMs in probands with CHD and autism was also found.",

The quality of top-down liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) data sets is rapidly increasing on account of advances in instrumentation and sample-processing protocols. However, top-down mass spectra are substantially more complex than conventional bottom-up data. New algorithms and software tools for confident proteoform identification and quantification are needed. Here we present Informed-Proteomics, an open-source software suite for top-down proteomics analysis that consists of an LC-MS feature-finding algorithm, a database search algorithm, and an interactive results viewer. We compare our tool with several other popular tools using human-in-mouse xenograft luminal and basal breast tumor samples that are known to have significant differences in protein abundance based on bottom-up analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies of somatic and germline mutations have led to the identification of a number of factors that influence point mutation rates, including CpG methylation, expression levels, replication timing, and GC content. Intriguingly, some of the effects appear to differ between soma and germline: in particular, whereas mutation rates have been reported to decrease with expression levels in tumors, no clear effect has been detected in the germline. Distinct approaches were taken to analyze the data, however, so it is hard to know whether these apparent differences are real. To enable a cleaner comparison, we considered a statistical model in which the mutation rate of a coding region is predicted by GC content, expression levels, replication timing, and two histone repressive marks. We applied this model to both a set of germline mutations identified in exomes and to exonic somatic mutations in four types of tumors. Most determinants of mutations are shared: notably, we detected an effect of expression levels on both germline and somatic mutation rates. Moreover, in all tissues considered, higher expression levels are associated with greater strand asymmetry of mutations. However, mutation rates increase with expression levels in testis (and, more tentatively, in ovary), whereas they decrease with expression levels in somatic tissues. This contrast points to differences in damage or repair rates during transcription in soma and germline.",

        "Abstract": "Different viruses could induced ROS generation to alter intracellular redox state in the host cells, and unbalanced redox state was suggested to have various effects on viral replication. In this study, we investigated the influence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on replication of spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV) in fish cells. After SVCV infection, there existed a time-dependent increase in ROS generation. The present results revealed that antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) resulted in a lower ROS levels and increased SVCV replication in EPC cell. In contrast, a GSH synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) induced ROS generation and decreased SVCV replication. In addition, activation of NF-\u03baB suppressed SVCV replication by using two inhibitors of cytokine-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation. More importantly, enhancement of the activity of NF-\u03baB was found in BSO treatment, which indicated that dropped SVCV replication likely occurred via ROS activation of NF-\u03baB. Overall, our results revealed that the SVCV infection and replication could generate ROS and be affected by the redox state, where this progression was associated with the alteration in NF-\u03baB pathway induced by oxidative stress.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) is a common and often lethal birth defect characterized by diaphragmatic structural defects and pulmonary hypoplasia. CDH is isolated in 60% of newborns, but may also be part of a complex phenotype with additional anomalies. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on 87 individuals with isolated or complex CDH and on their unaffected parents, to assess the contribution of de novo mutations in the etiology of diaphragmatic and pulmonary defects and to identify new candidate genes. A combined analysis with 39 additional trios with complex CDH, previously published, revealed a significant genome-wide burden of de novo variants compared to background mutation rate and 900 control trios. We identified an increased burden of likely gene-disrupting (LGD, i.e. nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site) and predicted deleterious missense (D-mis) variants in complex and isolated CDH patients. Overall, an excess of predicted damaging de novo LGD and D-mis variants relative to the expected frequency contributed to 21% of complex cases and 12% of isolated CDH cases. The burden of de novo variants was higher in genes expressed in the developing mouse diaphragm and heart. Some overlap with genes responsible for congenital heart defects and neurodevelopmental disorders was observed in CDH patients within our cohorts. We propose that de novo variants contribute significantly to the development of CDH.",

        "Abstract": "A paradigm in transplantation states that graft-infiltrating T cells are largely non-alloreactive \"bystander\" cells. However, the origin and specificity of allograft T cells over time has not been investigated in detail in animals or humans. Here, we use polychromatic flow cytometry and high throughput TCR sequencing of serial biopsies to show that gut-resident T cell turnover kinetics in human intestinal allografts are correlated with the balance between intra-graft host-vs-graft (HvG) and graft-vs-host (GvH) reactivities and with clinical outcomes. In the absence of rejection, donor T cells were enriched for GvH-reactive clones that persisted long-term in the graft. Early expansion of GvH clones in the graft correlated with rapid replacement of donor APCs by the recipient. Rejection was associated with transient infiltration by blood-like recipient CD28+ NKG2D",

        "Title": "High-resolution ultrahigh-pressure long column reversed-phase liquid chromatography for top-down proteomics.",
        "Abstract": "Separation of proteoforms for global intact protein analysis (i.e. top-down proteomics) has lagged well behind what is achievable for peptides in traditional bottom-up proteomic approach and is becoming a true bottle neck for top-down proteomics. Herein, we report use of long (\u22651M) columns containing short alkyl (C1-C4) bonded phases to achieve high-resolution RPLC for separation of proteoforms. At a specific operation pressure limit (i.e., 96.5MPa or 14Kpsi used in this work), column length was found to be the most important factor for achieving maximal resolution separation of proteins when 1.5-5\u03bcm particles were used as packings and long columns provided peak capacities greater than 400 for proteoforms derived from a global cell lysate with molecular weights below 50kDa. Larger proteoforms (50-110kDa) were chromatographed on long RPLC columns and detected by MS; however, they cannot be identified yet by tandem mass spectrometry. Our experimental data further demonstrated that long alkyl (e.g., C8 and C18) bonded particles provided high-resolution RPLC for <10kDa proteoforms, not efficient for separation of global proteoforms. Reversed-phase particles with porous, nonporous, and superficially porous surfaces were systematically investigated for high-resolution RPLC. Pore size (200-400\u00c5) and the surface structure (porous and superficially porous) of particles was found to have minor influences on high-resolution RPLC of proteoforms. RPLC presented herein enabled confident identification of \u223c900 proteoforms (1% FDR) for a low-microgram quantity of proteomic samples using a single RPLC-MS/MS analysis. The level of RPLC performance attained in this work is close to that typically realized in bottom-up proteomics, and broadly useful when applying e.g., the single-stage MS accurate mass tag approach, but less effective when combined with current tandem MS. Our initial data indicate that MS detection and fragmentation inefficiencies provided by current high-resolution mass spectrometers are key challenges for characterization of larger proteoforms.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have identified many genes with rare de novo mutations in autism, but a limited number of these have been conclusively established as disease-susceptibility genes due to the lack of recurrence and confounding background mutations. Such extreme genetic heterogeneity severely limits recurrence-based statistical power even in studies with a large sample size. Here, we use cell-type specific expression profiles to differentiate mutations in autism patients from those in unaffected siblings. We report a gene expression signature in different neuronal cell types shared by genes with likely gene-disrupting (LGD) mutations in autism cases. This signature reflects haploinsufficiency of risk genes enriched in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators, with the strongest positive associations with specific types of neurons in different brain regions, including cortical neurons, cerebellar granule cells, and striatal medium spiny neurons. When used to prioritize genes with a single LGD mutation in cases, a D-score derived from the signature achieved a precision of 40% as compared with the 15% baseline with a minimal loss in sensitivity. An ensemble model combining D-score with mutation intolerance metrics from Exome Aggregation Consortium further improved the precision to 60%, resulting in 117 high-priority candidates. These prioritized lists can facilitate identification of additional autism-susceptibility genes.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD), a prevalent birth defect occurring in 1% of newborns, likely results from aberrant expression of cardiac developmental genes. Mutations in a variety of cardiac transcription factors, developmental signalling molecules and molecules that modify chromatin cause at least 20% of disease, but most CHD remains unexplained. We employ RNAseq analyses to assess allele-specific expression (ASE) and biallelic loss-of-expression (LOE) in 172 tissue samples from 144 surgically repaired CHD subjects. Here we show that only 5% of known imprinted genes with paternal allele silencing are monoallelic versus 56% with paternal allele expression-this cardiac-specific phenomenon seems unrelated to CHD. Further, compared with control subjects, CHD subjects have a significant burden of both LOE genes and ASE events associated with altered gene expression. These studies identify FGFBP2, LBH, RBFOX2, SGSM1 and ZBTB16 as candidate CHD genes because of significantly altered transcriptional expression.",

        "Abstract": "Haplotype phasing of genetic variants is important for clinical interpretation of the genome, population genetic analysis and functional genomic analysis of allelic activity. Here we present phASER, an accurate approach for phasing variants that are overlapped by sequencing reads, including those from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which often span multiple exons due to splicing. Using diverse RNA-seq data we demonstrate that this provides more accurate phasing of rare variants compared with population-based phasing and allows phasing of variants in the same gene up to hundreds of kilobases away that cannot be obtained from DNA sequencing (DNA-seq) reads. We show that in the context of medical genetic studies this improves the resolution of compound heterozygotes. Additionally, phASER provides measures of haplotypic expression that increase power and accuracy in studies of allelic expression. In summary, phasing using RNA-seq and phASER is accurate and improves studies where rare variant haplotypes or allelic expression is needed.",

        "Abstract": "Via whole-exome sequencing, we identified six females from independent families with a common neurodevelopmental phenotype including developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism, hypotonia, and seizures, all with de novo predicted deleterious variants in the nuclear localization signal of Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein H2, encoded by HNRNPH2, a gene located on the X chromosome. Many of the females also have seizures, psychiatric co-morbidities, and orthopedic, gastrointestinal, and growth problems as well as common dysmorphic facial features. HNRNPs are a large group of ubiquitous proteins that associate with pre-mRNAs in eukaryotic cells to produce a multitude of alternatively spliced mRNA products during development and play an important role in controlling gene expression. The failure to identify affected males, the severity of the neurodevelopmental phenotype in females, and the essential role of this gene suggests that male conceptuses with these variants may not be viable.",

        "Abstract": "Cancer and developmental disorders (DDs) share dysregulated cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. There are well-known genes implicated in both in cancer and DDs. In this study, we aim to quantify this genetic connection using publicly available data. We found that among DD patients, germline damaging de novo variants are more enriched in cancer driver genes than non-drivers. We estimate that cancer driver genes comprise about a third of DD risk genes. Additionally, de novo likely-gene-disrupting variants are more enriched in tumor suppressors, and about 40% of implicated de novo damaging missense variants are located in cancer somatic mutation hotspots, indicating that many genes have a similar mode of action in cancer and DDs. Our results suggest that we can view tumors as natural laboratories for assessing the deleterious effects of mutations that are applicable to germline variants and identification of causal genes and variants in DDs.",

        "Abstract": "Short-read sequencing has enabled the de novo assembly of several individual human genomes, but with inherent limitations in characterizing repeat elements. Here we sequence a Chinese individual HX1 by single-molecule real-time (SMRT) long-read sequencing, construct a physical map by NanoChannel arrays and generate a de novo assembly of 2.93\u2009Gb (contig N50: 8.3\u2009Mb, scaffold N50: 22.0\u2009Mb, including 39.3\u2009Mb N-bases), together with 206\u2009Mb of alternative haplotypes. The assembly fully or partially fills 274 (28.4%) N-gaps in the reference genome GRCh38. Comparison to GRCh38 reveals 12.8\u2009Mb of HX1-specific sequences, including 4.1\u2009Mb that are not present in previously reported Asian genomes. Furthermore, long-read sequencing of the transcriptome reveals novel spliced genes that are not annotated in GENCODE and are missed by short-read RNA-Seq. Our results imply that improved characterization of genome functional variation may require the use of a range of genomic technologies on diverse human populations.",

        "Abstract": "Although immune signaling has emerged as a defining feature of the glioma microenvironment, how the underlying structure of the glioma-infiltrating T-cell population differs from that of the blood from which it originates has been difficult to measure directly in patients. High-throughput sequencing of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires (TCRseq) provides a population-wide statistical description of how T cells respond to disease. We have defined immunophenotypes of whole repertoires based on TCRseq of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains from glioma tissue, nonneoplastic brain tissue, and peripheral blood from patients. Using information theory, we partitioned the diversity of these TCR repertoires into that from the distribution of VJ cassette combinations and diversity due to VJ-independent factors, such as selection due to antigen binding. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) possessed higher VJ-independent diversity than nonneoplastic tissue, stratifying patients according to tumor grade. We found that the VJ-independent components of tumor-associated repertoires diverge more from their corresponding peripheral repertoires than T-cell populations in nonneoplastic brain tissue, particularly for low-grade gliomas. Finally, we identified a \"signature\" set of TCRs whose use in peripheral blood is associated with patients exhibiting low TIL divergence and is depleted in patients with highly divergent TIL repertoires. This signature is detectable in peripheral blood, and therefore accessible noninvasively. We anticipate that these immunophenotypes will be foundational to monitoring and predicting response to antiglioma vaccines and immunotherapy.",

Using exome sequencing, we have identified four patients with similar phenotypes of developmental delay, intellectual disability, failure to thrive, hypotonia, ataxia, and tooth enamel defects who all have the same de novo R331W missense variant in C-terminal binding protein 1 (CTBP1). CTBP1 is a transcriptional regulator critical for development by coordinating different regulatory pathways. The R331W variant found in these patients is within the C-terminal portion of the PLDLS (Pro-Leu-Asp-Leu-Ser) binding cleft, which is the domain through which CTBP1, interacts with chromatin-modifying enzymes and mediates chromatin-dependent gene repression pathways. This is the first report of mutations within CTBP1 in association with any human disease.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) patients have an increased prevalence of extracardiac congenital anomalies (CAs) and risk of neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDDs). Exome sequencing of 1213 CHD parent-offspring trios identified an excess of protein-damaging de novo mutations, especially in genes highly expressed in the developing heart and brain. These mutations accounted for 20% of patients with CHD, NDD, and CA but only 2% of patients with isolated CHD. Mutations altered genes involved in morphogenesis, chromatin modification, and transcriptional regulation, including multiple mutations in RBFOX2, a regulator of mRNA splicing. Genes mutated in other cohorts examined for NDD were enriched in CHD cases, particularly those with coexisting NDD. These findings reveal shared genetic contributions to CHD, NDD, and CA and provide opportunities for improved prognostic assessment and early therapeutic intervention in CHD patients.",

        "Abstract": "Alloreactive T lymphocytes are the primary mediators of allograft rejection. The size and diversity of the HLA-alloreactive T cell repertoire has thus far precluded the ability to follow these T cells and thereby to understand their fate in human transplant recipients. This review summarizes the history, challenges, and recent advances in the study of alloreactive T cells. We highlight the historical development of assays to measure alloreactivity and discuss how high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing-based assays can provide a new window into the fate of alloreactive T cells in human transplant recipients. A specific approach combining a classical in vitro assay, the mixed lymphocyte reaction, with deep T cell receptor sequencing is described as a tool to track the donor-reactive T cell repertoire for any specific HLA-mismatched donor-recipient pair. This assay can provide mechanistic insights and has potential as a noninvasive, highly specific biomarker for rejection and tolerance.",

        "Abstract": "As one of the most serious pathogens in the freshwater aquatic environment, Saprolegnia can induce a high mortality rate during the fish egg incubation period. This study investigated the anti-Saprolegnia activity of a total of 108 plants on Saprolegnia parasitica in vitro and Dioscorea collettii was selected for further studies. By loading on an open silica gel column and eluting with petroleum ether-ethyl acetate-methanol, dioscin (C45H72O16) was isolated from D. collettii. Saprolegnia parasitica growth was inhibited significantly when dioscin concentration was more than 2.0 mg\u00a0L(-1). When compared with formalin and hydrogen peroxide, dioscin showed a higher inhibitory effect. As potential inhibition mechanisms, dioscin could cause the S. parasitica mycelium morphologic damage, dense folds, or disheveled protuberances observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy and the influx of Propidium iodide. The structural changes in the treated mycelium were indicative of an efficient anti-Saprolegnia activity of dioscin. The oxidative stress results showed that dioscin also accumulated reactive oxygen species excessively and increased total antioxidant and superoxide dismutase activity. These situations could render S. parasitica more vulnerable to oxidative damage. Additionally, when dioscin concentration was less than 2.0 mg\u00a0L(-1), the survival rate of embryos was more than 70%. Therefore, the use of dioscin could be a viable way of preventing and controlling saprolegniasis.",

        "Abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has greatly helped us identify disease-contributory variants for Mendelian diseases. However, users are often faced with issues such as software compatibility, complicated configuration, and no access to high-performance computing facility. Discrepancies exist among aligners and variant callers. We developed a computational pipeline, SeqMule, to perform automated variant calling from NGS data on human genomes and exomes. SeqMule integrates computational-cluster-free parallelization capability built on top of the variant callers, and facilitates normalization/intersection of variant calls to generate consensus set with high confidence. SeqMule integrates 5 alignment tools, 5 variant calling algorithms and accepts various combinations all by one-line command, therefore allowing highly flexible yet fully automated variant calling. In a modern machine (2 Intel Xeon X5650 CPUs, 48 GB memory), when fast turn-around is needed, SeqMule generates annotated VCF files in a day from a 30X whole-genome sequencing data set; when more accurate calling is needed, SeqMule generates consensus call set that improves over single callers, as measured by both Mendelian error rate and consistency. SeqMule supports Sun Grid Engine for parallel processing, offers turn-key solution for deployment on Amazon Web Services, allows quality check, Mendelian error check, consistency evaluation, HTML-based reports. SeqMule is available at http://seqmule.openbioinformatics.org.",

        "Abstract": "The etiology of intellectual disabilities (ID) remains unknown for the majority of patients. Due to reduced reproductive fitness in many individuals with ID, de novo mutations account for a significant portion of severe ID. The ATP-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin modifier has been linked with neurodevelopmental disorders including ID and autism. ARID2 is an intrinsic component of polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF), the SWI/SNF subcomplex. In this study, we used clinical whole exome sequencing (WES) in proband-parent-trios to identify the etiology of ID. We identified four independent, novel, loss of function variants in ARID2 gene in four patients, three of which were confirmed to be de novo. The patients all have ID and share other clinical characteristics including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, short stature, dysmorphic facial features, and Wormian bones. All four novel variants are predicted to lead to a premature termination with the loss of the two conservative zinc finger motifs. This is the first report of mutations in ARID2 associated with developmental delay and ID.",

        "Abstract": "Over a quarter of drugs that enter clinical development fail because they are ineffective. Growing insight into genes that influence human disease may affect how drug targets and indications are selected. However, there is little guidance about how much weight should be given to genetic evidence in making these key decisions. To answer this question, we investigated how well the current archive of genetic evidence predicts drug mechanisms. We found that, among well-studied indications, the proportion of drug mechanisms with direct genetic support increases significantly across the drug development pipeline, from 2.0% at the preclinical stage to 8.2% among mechanisms for approved drugs, and varies dramatically among disease areas. We estimate that selecting genetically supported targets could double the success rate in clinical development. Therefore, using the growing wealth of human genetic data to select the best targets and indications should have a measurable impact on the successful development of new drugs.",

        "Abstract": "Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) represent rare but serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Both are characterized by distinctive blistering lesions and significant mortality rates. While there is evidence for strong drug-specific genetic predisposition related to HLA alleles, recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) on European and Asian populations have failed to identify genetic susceptibility alleles that are common across multiple drugs. We hypothesize that this is a consequence of the low to moderate effect size of individual genetic risk factors. To test this hypothesis we developed Pointer, a new algorithm that assesses the aggregate effect of multiple low risk variants on a pathway using a gene set enrichment approach. A key advantage of our method is the capability to associate SNPs with genes by exploiting physical proximity as well as by using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that capture information about both cis- and trans-acting regulatory effects. We control for known bias-inducing aspects of enrichment based analyses, such as: 1) gene length, 2) gene set size, 3) presence of biologically related genes within the same linkage disequilibrium (LD) region, and, 4) genes shared among multiple gene sets. We applied this approach to publicly available SJS/TEN genome-wide genotype data and identified the ABC transporter and Proteasome pathways as potentially implicated in the genetic susceptibility of non-drug-specific SJS/TEN. We demonstrated that the innovative SNP-to-gene mapping phase of the method was essential in detecting the significant enrichment for those pathways. Analysis of an independent gene expression dataset provides supportive functional evidence for the involvement of Proteasome pathways in SJS/TEN cutaneous lesions. These results suggest that Pointer provides a useful framework for the integrative analysis of pharmacogenetic GWAS data, by increasing the power to detect aggregate effects of multiple low risk variants.

        "Abstract": "Cooperative systems are susceptible to invasion by\u00a0selfish individuals that profit from receiving the social benefits but fail to contribute. These so-called \"cheaters\" can have a fitness advantage in the laboratory, but it is unclear whether cheating provides an important selective advantage in nature. We used a population genomic approach to examine the history of genes involved in cheating behaviors in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, testing whether these genes experience rapid evolutionary change as a result of conflict over spore-stalk fate. Candidate genes and surrounding regions showed elevated polymorphism, unusual patterns of linkage disequilibrium, and lower levels of population differentiation, but they did not show greater between-species divergence. The signatures were most consistent with frequency-dependent selection acting to maintain multiple alleles, suggesting that conflict may lead to stalemate rather than an escalating arms race. Our results reveal the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation and cheating and underscore how sequence-based approaches can be used to elucidate the history of conflicts that are difficult to observe directly.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a serious birth defect that accounts for 8% of all major birth anomalies. Approximately 40% of cases occur in association with other anomalies. As sporadic complex CDH likely has a significant impact on reproductive fitness, we hypothesized that de novo variants would account for the etiology in a significant fraction of cases. We performed exome sequencing in 39 CDH trios and compared the frequency of de novo variants with 787 unaffected controls from the Simons Simplex Collection. We found no significant difference in overall frequency of de novo variants between cases and controls. However, among genes that are highly expressed during diaphragm development, there was a significant burden of likely gene disrupting (LGD) and predicted deleterious missense variants in cases (fold enrichment = 3.2, P-value = 0.003), and these genes are more likely to be haploinsufficient (P-value = 0.01) than the ones with benign missense or synonymous de novo variants in cases. After accounting for the frequency of de novo variants in the control population, we estimate that 15% of sporadic complex CDH patients are attributable to de novo LGD or deleterious missense variants. We identified several genes with predicted deleterious de novo variants that fall into common categories of genes related to transcription factors and cell migration that we believe are related to the pathogenesis of CDH. These data provide supportive evidence for novel genes in the pathogenesis of CDH associated with other anomalies and suggest that de novo variants play a significant role in complex CDH cases.",

Tolerance was first intentionally induced in humans via combined kidney and bone marrow transplantation (CKBMT), but the mechanisms of tolerance in these patients are incompletely understood. We now establish an assay to identify donor-reactive T cells and test the role of deletion in tolerance after CKBMT. Using high-throughput sequencing of the T cell receptor B chain CDR3 region, we define a fingerprint of the donor-reactive T cell repertoire before transplantation and track those clones after transplant. We observed posttransplant reductions in donor-reactive T cell clones in three tolerant CKBMT patients; such reductions were not observed in a fourth, nontolerant, CKBMT patient or in two conventional kidney transplant recipients on standard immunosuppressive regimens. T cell repertoire turnover due to lymphocyte-depleting conditioning only partially accounted for the observed reductions in tolerant patients; in fact, conventional transplant recipients showed expansion of circulating donor-reactive clones, despite extensive repertoire turnover. Moreover, loss of donor-reactive T cell clones more closely associated with tolerance induction than in vitro functional assays. Our analysis supports clonal deletion as a mechanism of allograft tolerance in CKBMT patients. The results validate the contribution of donor-reactive T cell clones identified before transplant by our method, supporting further exploration as a potential biomarker of transplant outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "The recent finding that reprogrammed human pluripotent stem cells can be derived by nuclear transfer into human oocytes as well as by induced expression of defined factors has revitalized the debate on whether one approach might be advantageous over the other. Here we compare the genetic and epigenetic integrity of human nuclear-transfer embryonic stem cell (NT-ESC) lines and isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines, derived from the same somatic cell cultures of fetal, neonatal, and adult origin. The two cell types showed similar genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles. Importantly, NT-ESCs and iPSCs had comparable numbers of de novo coding mutations, but significantly more than parthenogenetic ESCs. As iPSCs, NT-ESCs displayed clone- and gene-specific aberrations in DNA methylation and allele-specific expression of imprinted genes. The occurrence of these genetic and epigenetic defects in both NT-ESCs and iPSCs suggests that they are inherent to reprogramming, regardless of derivation approach.",

We present here a multidimensional, quantitative analysis of human T cell compartmentalization and maintenance over six decades of life in blood, lymphoid, and mucosal tissues obtained from 56 individual organ donors. Our results reveal that the distribution and tissue residence of naive, central, and effector memory, and terminal effector subsets is contingent on both their differentiation state and tissue localization. Moreover, T cell homeostasis driven by cytokine or TCR-mediated signals is different in CD4+ or CD8+ T cell lineages, varies with their differentiation stage and tissue localization, and cannot be inferred from blood. Our data provide an unprecedented spatial and temporal map of human T cell compartmentalization and maintenance, supporting distinct pathways for human T cell fate determination and homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Recent genome-wide association studies identified certain human leukocyote antigen (HLA) alleles as the major risk factors of drug-induced liver injuries (DILI). While these alleles often cause large relative risk, their predictive values are quite low due to low prevalence of idiosyncratic DILI. Finding additional risk factors is important for precision medicine. However, optimal design of further genetic studies is hindered by uncertain overall heritability of DILI. This is a common problem for low-prevalence pharmacological traits, since it is difficult to obtain clinical outcome data in families. Here we estimated the heritability (h(2)) of DILI from case-control genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data using a method based on random effect models. We estimated the proportion of h(2) captured by common SNPs for DILI to be between 0.3 and 0.5. For co-amoxiclav induced DILI, chromosome 6 explained part of the heritability, indicating additional contributions from common variants yet to be found. We performed simulations to assess the robustness of the h(2) estimate with limited sample size under low prevelance, a condition typical to studies on idiosyncratic pharmacological traits. Our findings suggest that common variants outside of HLA contribute to DILI susceptability; therefore, it is valuable to conduct further GWAS with expanded case collection.",

        "Abstract": "We present CANOES, an algorithm for the detection of rare copy number variants from exome sequencing data. CANOES models read counts using a negative binomial distribution and estimates variance of the read counts using a regression-based approach based on selected reference samples in a given dataset. We test CANOES on a family-based exome sequencing dataset, and show that its sensitivity and specificity is comparable to that of XHMM. Moreover, the method is complementary to Gaussian approximation-based methods (e.g. XHMM or CoNIFER). When CANOES is used in combination with these methods, it will be possible to produce high accuracy calls, as demonstrated by a much reduced and more realistic de novo rate in results from trio data.",

        "Abstract": "This study investigated the effects of trifloxystrobin that one strobilurin used widely in the world as an effective fungicidal agent to control Asian soybean rust on aquatic unicellular algae Chlorella vulgaris. We determined the potential toxic effect of trifloxystrobin on C. vulgaris, and found median inhibition concentration (IC(50)) value 255.58 (95% confidence interval, 207.81-330.29)\u03bcgL(-1). In addition, the algal cells were obviously depressed or shrunk at different concentrations by electron microscopy. In the study, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay showed changes in transcript abundances of three photosynthetic genes, psaB, psbC, and rbcL, and one energy gene, ATPs. The results showed that trifloxystrobin reduced the transcript abundances of the three genes and enhanced expression of ATPs after 48 and 96 h. The lowest abundances of psaB, psbC and rbcL transcripts in response to trifloxystrobin exposure were 58%, 79% and 60% of those of the control, respectively. For the potential toxic influences, trifloxystrobin could decrease the soluble protein and total antioxidant contents (T-AOC), and increase superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activity with a gradual concentration-response relationship.

        "Title": "Genome wide analysis of drug-induced torsades de pointes: lack of common variants with large effect sizes.",
        "Abstract": "Marked prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram associated with the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia Torsades de Pointes is a serious adverse event during treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs and other culprit medications, and is a common cause for drug relabeling and withdrawal. Although clinical risk factors have been identified, the syndrome remains unpredictable in an individual patient. Here we used genome-wide association analysis to search for common predisposing genetic variants. Cases of drug-induced Torsades de Pointes (diTdP), treatment tolerant controls, and general population controls were ascertained across multiple sites using common definitions, and genotyped on the Illumina 610k or 1M-Duo BeadChips. Principal Components Analysis was used to select 216 Northwestern European diTdP cases and 771 ancestry-matched controls, including treatment-tolerant and general population subjects. With these sample sizes, there is 80% power to detect a variant at genome-wide significance with minor allele frequency of 10% and conferring an odds ratio of \u22652.7. Tests of association were carried out for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) by logistic regression adjusting for gender and population structure. No SNP reached genome wide-significance; the variant with the lowest P value was rs2276314, a non-synonymous coding variant in C18orf21 (p \u200a=\u200a 3\u00d710(-7), odds ratio\u200a=\u200a2, 95% confidence intervals: 1.5-2.6). The haplotype formed by rs2276314 and a second SNP, rs767531, was significantly more frequent in controls than cases (p \u200a=\u200a 3\u00d710(-9)). Expanding the number of controls and a gene-based analysis did not yield significant associations. This study argues that common genomic variants do not contribute importantly to risk for drug-induced Torsades de Pointes across multiple drugs.",

After failing to identify a diagnosis after routine metabolic evaluation, we utilized a combination of RNA-Seq and whole exome sequencing to identify a novel homozygous p.Ser171Phe Transaldolase (TALDO1) variant in the proband, his brother with cirrhosis, as well as a clinically asymptomatic older 8-year-old brother. Metabolite analysis and enzymatic testing of TALDO1 demonstrated elevated ribitol, sedoheptitol, and sedoheptulose-7P, and lack of activity of TALDO1 in the three children homozygous for the p.Ser171Phe mutation. Our findings expand the phenotype of transaldolase deficiency to include early onset hepatocellular carcinoma in humans and demonstrate that, even within the same family, individuals with the same homozygous mutation demonstrate a wide range of phenotypes.",

        "Title": "Characterizing immunoglobulin repertoire from whole blood by a personal genome sequencer.",
        "Abstract": "In human immune system, V(D)J recombination produces an enormously large repertoire of immunoglobulins (Ig) so that they can tackle different antigens from bacteria, viruses and tumor cells. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of next-generation sequencers such as Roche 454 and Illumina Genome Analyzer to characterize the repertoire of immunoglobulins. However, these techniques typically require separation of B cell population from whole blood and require a few weeks for running the sequencers, so it may not be practical to implement them in clinical settings. Recently, the Ion Torrent personal genome sequencer has emerged as a tabletop personal genome sequencer that can be operated in a time-efficient and cost-effective manner. In this study, we explored the technical feasibility to use multiplex PCR for amplifying V(D)J recombination for IgH, directly from whole blood, then sequence the amplicons by the Ion Torrent sequencer. The whole process including data generation and analysis can be completed in one day. We tested the method in a pilot study on patients with benign, atypical and malignant meningiomas. Despite the noisy data, we were able to compare the samples by their usage frequencies of the V segment, as well as their somatic hypermutation rates. In summary, our study suggested that it is technically feasible to perform clinical monitoring of V(D)J recombination within a day by personal genome sequencers.",

        "Abstract": "Magnetically guided ultrasound-powered nanowire motors, functionalized with bioreceptors and a drug-loaded polymeric segment, are described for \"capture and transport\" and drug-delivery processes. These high-performance fuel-free motors display advanced capabilities and functionalities, including magnetic guidance, coordinated aligned movement, cargo towing, capture and isolation of biological targets, drug delivery, and operation in real-life biological and environmental media. The template-prepared three-segment Au-Ni-Au nanowire motors are propelled acoustically by mechanical waves produced by a piezoelectric transducer. An embedded nickel segment facilitates a magnetically guided motion as well as transport of large \"cargo\" along predetermined trajectories. Substantial improvement in the speed and power is realized by the controlled concavity formation at the end of the motor nanowire using a sphere lithography protocol. Functionalization of the Au segments with lectin and antiprotein A antibody bioreceptors allows capture and transport of E. coli and S. aureus bacteria, respectively. Potential therapeutic applications are illustrated in connection to the addition of a pH-sensitive drug-loaded polymeric (PPy-PSS) segment. The attractive capabilities of these fuel-free acoustically driven functionalized Au-Ni-Au nanowires, along with the simple preparation procedure and minimal adverse effects of ultrasonic waves, make them highly attractive for diverse in vivo biomedical applications.",

        "Abstract": "X-linked congenital generalized hypertrichosis (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 307150) is an extremely rare condition of hair overgrowth on different body sites. We previously reported linkage in a large Mexican family with X-linked congenital generalized hypertrichosis cosegregating with deafness and with dental and palate anomalies to Xq24-27. Using SNP oligonucleotide microarray analysis and whole-genome sequencing, we identified a 389-kb interchromosomal insertion at an extragenic palindrome site at Xq27.1 that completely cosegregates with the disease. Among the genes surrounding the insertion, we found that Fibroblast Growth Factor 13 (FGF13) mRNA levels were significantly reduced in affected individuals, and immunofluorescence staining revealed a striking decrease in FGF13 localization throughout the outer root sheath of affected hair follicles. Taken together, our findings suggest a role for FGF13 in hair follicle growth and in the hair cycle.",

        "Abstract": "We demonstrate an attractive nanomachine \"capture and transport\" target isolation strategy based on molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). MIP-based catalytic microtubular engines are prepared by electropolymerization of the outer polymeric layer in the presence of the target analyte (template). Tailor-made selective artificial recognition sites are thus introduced into the tubular microtransporters through complementary nanocavities in the outer polymeric layer. The new microtransporter concept is illustrated using bilayer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)/Pt-Ni microengines and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled avidin (Av-FITC) as the template. The avidin-imprinted polymeric layer selectively concentrates the fluorescent-tagged protein target onto the moving microengine without the need for additional external functionalization, allowing \"on-the-fly\" extraction and isolation of Av-FITC from raw serum and saliva samples along with real-time visualization of the protein loading and transport. The new micromachine-MIP-based target isolation strategy can be extended to the capture and transport of other important target molecules, leading toward diverse biomedical and environmental applications.",

Genetic factors including aneuploidies and copy number variants are important in the pathogenesis of many cases of CDH, but few single genes have been definitively implicated in human CDH. In this study, we used whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify a paternally inherited novel missense GATA4 variant (c.754C>T; p.R252W) in a familial case of CDH with incomplete penetrance. Phenotypic characterization of the family included magnetic resonance imaging of the chest and abdomen demonstrating asymptomatic defects in the diaphragm in the two \"unaffected\" missense variant carriers. Screening 96 additional CDH patients identified a de novo heterozygous GATA4 variant (c.848G>A; p.R283H) in a non-isolated CDH patient. In summary, GATA4 is implicated in both familial and sporadic CDH, and our data suggests that WES may be a powerful tool to discover rare variants for CDH.",

High-pH reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), followed by fraction concatenation, affords better peptide analysis than conventional strong cation-exchange chromatography applied for 2D proteomic analysis. For example, concatenated high-pH RPLC increased identification of peptides (by 1.8-fold) and proteins (by 1.6-fold) in shotgun proteomics analyses of a digested human protein sample. Additional advantages of high-pH RPLC with fraction concatenation include improved protein sequence coverage, simplified sample processing and reduced sample losses, making this an attractive alternative to strong cation-exchange chromatography in conjunction with second-dimension low-pH RPLC for 2D proteomics analyses.",

        "Title": "Improving collision induced dissociation (CID), high energy collision dissociation (HCD), and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) fourier transform MS/MS degradome-peptidome identifications using high accuracy mass information.",
        "Abstract": "MS dissociation methods, including collision induced dissociation (CID), high energy collision dissociation (HCD), and electron transfer dissociation (ETD), can each contribute distinct peptidome identifications using conventional peptide identification methods (Shen et al. J. Proteome Res. 2011), but such samples still pose significant informatics challenges. In this work, we explored utilization of high accuracy fragment ion mass measurements, in this case provided by Fourier transform MS/MS, to improve peptidome peptide data set size and consistency relative to conventional descriptive and probabilistic scoring methods. For example, we identified 20-40% more peptides than SEQUEST, Mascot, and MS_GF scoring methods using high accuracy fragment ion information and the same false discovery rate (FDR) from CID, HCD, and ETD spectra. Identified species covered >90% of the collective identifications obtained using various conventional peptide identification methods, which significantly addresses the common issue of different data analysis methods generating different peptide data sets. Choice of peptide dissociation and high-precision measurement-based identification methods presently available for degradomic-peptidomic analyses needs to be based on the coverage and confidence (or specificity) afforded by the method, as well as practical issues (e.g., throughput). By using accurate fragment information, >1000 peptidome components can be identified from a single human blood plasma analysis with low peptide-level FDRs (e.g., 0.6%), providing an improved basis for investigating potential disease-related peptidome components.",

        "Abstract": "In the last two years, because of advances in protein separation and mass spectrometry, top-down mass spectrometry moved from analyzing single proteins to analyzing complex samples and identifying hundreds and even thousands of proteins. However, computational tools for database search of top-down spectra against protein databases are still in their infancy. We describe MS-Align+, a fast algorithm for top-down protein identification based on spectral alignment that enables searches for unexpected post-translational modifications. We also propose a method for evaluating statistical significance of top-down protein identifications and further benchmark various software tools on two top-down data sets from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium. We demonstrate that MS-Align+ significantly increases the number of identified spectra as compared with MASCOT and OMSSA on both data sets. Although MS-Align+ and ProSightPC have similar performance on the Salmonella typhimurium data set, MS-Align+ outperforms ProSightPC on the (more complex) Saccharomyces cerevisiae data set.",

        "Abstract": "We report on the effectiveness of CID, HCD, and ETD for LC-FT MS/MS analysis of peptides using a tandem linear ion trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. A range of software tools and analysis parameters were employed to explore the use of CID, HCD, and ETD to identify peptides (isolated from human blood plasma) without the use of specific \"enzyme rules\". In the evaluation of an FDR-controlled SEQUEST scoring method, the use of accurate masses for fragments increased the number of identified peptides (by ~50%) compared to the use of conventional low accuracy fragment mass information, and CID provided the largest contribution to the identified peptide data sets compared to HCD and ETD. The FDR-controlled Mascot scoring method provided significantly fewer peptide identifications than SEQUEST (by 1.3-2.3 fold) and CID, HCD, and ETD provided similar contributions to identified peptides. Evaluation of de novo sequencing and the UStags method for more intense fragment ions revealed that HCD afforded more contiguous residues (e.g., \u2265 7 amino acids) than either CID or ETD. Both the FDR-controlled SEQUEST and Mascot scoring methods provided peptide data sets that were affected by the decoy database used and mass tolerances applied (e.g., identical peptides between data sets could be limited to ~70%), while the UStags method provided the most consistent peptide data sets (>90% overlap). The m/z ranges in which CID, HCD, and ETD contributed the largest number of peptide identifications were substantially overlapping. This work suggests that the three peptide ion fragmentation methods are complementary and that maximizing the number of peptide identifications benefits significantly from a careful match with the informatics tools and methods applied. These results also suggest that the decoy strategy may inaccurately estimate identification FDRs.",

        "Abstract": "In this study, we evaluated a concatenated low pH (pH 3) and high pH (pH 10) reversed-phase liquid chromatography strategy as a first dimension for two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (\"shotgun\") proteomic analysis of trypsin-digested human MCF10A cell sample. Compared with the more traditional strong cation exchange method, the use of concatenated high pH reversed-phase liquid chromatography as a first-dimension fractionation strategy resulted in 1.8- and 1.6-fold increases in the number of peptide and protein identifications (with two or more unique peptides), respectively. In addition to broader identifications, advantages of the concatenated high pH fractionation approach include improved protein sequence coverage, simplified sample processing, and reduced sample losses. The results demonstrate that the concatenated high pH reversed-phased strategy is an attractive alternative to strong cation exchange for two-dimensional shotgun proteomic analysis.",

All of these five coordination polymers have three-dimensional (3-D) structural features, which are constructed by distinct substructures including clusters, chains, rings, and even 3-D frameworks. In all cases, 1,2,4-triazolate adopts a \u03bc(1,2,4) bridging mode, and chloride ions display a \u03bc(2), \u03bc(3), \u03bc(4) bridging mode, respectively, which makes the structural diversity in the assembling system, for example, \u03bc(4)-Cl and cadmium triazolate, build up an unprecedented tetranuclear cluster [Cd(4)(trz)(8)Cl](-) in 2. All of the materials exhibit intense blue fluorescent emission and high thermal stability, wherein 1 presents an interesting guest-responsive photoluminescent property.",

LC-Fourier transform tandem mass spectrometry (FT MS/MS) was used for acquiring mass spectra that were de novo sequenced and then searched against the IPI human protein database. Through the use of unique sequence tags (UStags), we unambiguously correlated the spectra to specific database proteins. Examination of the UStags' prefix and/or suffix sequences that contain cysteine(s) in conjunction with sequences of the UStags-specified database proteins is shown to enable the unambigious determination of disulfide bonds. Using this method, we identified the intermolecular and intramolecular disulfides in human blood plasma peptidome peptides that have molecular weights of up to approximately 10 kDa.",

        "Abstract": "Herein we describe a strategy for degradomic-peptidomic analyses. The human blood peptidome was isolated through application of AC/SEC, which enriched its components by >300-fold. The isolated peptidome components were separated by long column HRLC providing a peak capacity of approximately 300 for species having MWs of up to 20 kDa. The separated species were identified by the FT MS/MS-UStags sequencing method. We identified >200 peptidome components that originated from 29 protein substrates from the blood plasma of a single healthy person. The peptidome peptides identified had MWs range of 0.5-14 kDa and identifications were achieved with extremely low (near zero) false discovery rates through searching the IPI human protein database (approximately 70,000 entries). Some of the peptidome peptides identified have mutations and modifications such as acetylation, acetylhexosamine, amidation, cysteinylation, didehydro, oxidation, and pyro-glu. The capabilities described enable the global analysis of the peptidome peptides to identify degradome targets such as degradome proteases, proteases inhibitors, and other relevant substrates, the cleavage specificities for the degradation of individual substrates, as well as a potential basis for using the various extents of substrate degradation for diagnostic purposes.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate identification of genetic variants from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data is essential for immediate large-scale genomic endeavors such as the 1000 Genomes Project, and is crucial for further genetic analysis based on the discoveries. The key challenge in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery is to distinguish true individual variants (occurring at a low frequency) from sequencing errors (often occurring at frequencies orders of magnitude higher). Therefore, knowledge of the error probabilities of base calls is essential. We have developed Atlas-SNP2, a computational tool that detects and accounts for systematic sequencing errors caused by context-related variables in a logistic regression model learned from training data sets. Subsequently, it estimates the posterior error probability for each substitution through a Bayesian formula that integrates prior knowledge of the overall sequencing error probability and the estimated SNP rate with the results from the logistic regression model for the given substitutions. The estimated posterior SNP probability can be used to distinguish true SNPs from sequencing errors. Validation results show that Atlas-SNP2 achieves a false-positive rate of lower than 10%, with an approximately 5% or lower false-negative rate.",

        "Abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an important cause of serious liver disease. The antimicrobial agent flucloxacillin is a common cause of DILI, but the genetic basis for susceptibility remains unclear. We conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) study using 866,399 markers in 51 cases of flucloxacillin DILI and 282 controls matched for sex and ancestry. The GWA showed an association peak in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region with the strongest association (P = 8.7 x 10(-33)) seen for rs2395029[G], a marker in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with HLA-B*5701. Further MHC genotyping, which included 64 flucloxacillin-tolerant controls, confirmed the association with HLA-B*5701 (OR = 80.6, P = 9.0 x 10(-19)). The association was replicated in a second cohort of 23 cases. In HLA-B*5701 carrier cases, rs10937275 in ST6GAL1 on chromosome 3 also showed genome-wide significance (OR = 4.1, P = 1.4 x 10(-8)). These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of flucloxacillin DILI and have the potential to substantially improve diagnosis of this serious disease.",

        "Title": "The genome sequence of taurine cattle: a window to ruminant biology and evolution.",
        "Abstract": "To understand the biology and evolution of ruminants, the cattle genome was sequenced to about sevenfold coverage. The cattle genome contains a minimum of 22,000 genes, with a core set of 14,345 orthologs shared among seven mammalian species of which 1217 are absent or undetected in noneutherian (marsupial or monotreme) genomes. Cattle-specific evolutionary breakpoint regions in chromosomes have a higher density of segmental duplications, enrichment of repetitive elements, and species-specific variations in genes associated with lactation and immune responsiveness. Genes involved in metabolism are generally highly conserved, although five metabolic genes are deleted or extensively diverged from their human orthologs. The cattle genome sequence thus provides a resource for understanding mammalian evolution and accelerating livestock genetic improvement for milk and meat production.",

        "Abstract": "The goal of metabolomics analyses is the detection and quantitation of as many sample components as reasonably possible in order to identify compounds or \"features\" that can be used to characterize the samples under study. When utilizing electrospray ionization to produce ions for analysis by mass spectrometry (MS), it is important that metabolome sample constituents be efficiently separated prior to ion production, in order to minimize ionization suppression and thereby extend the dynamic range of the measurement, as well as the coverage of the metabolome. Similarly, optimization of the MS inlet and interface can lead to increased measurement sensitivity. This perspective review will focus on the role of high resolution liquid chromatography (LC) separations in conjunction with improved ion production and transmission for LC-MS-based metabolomics. Additional emphasis will be placed on the compromise between metabolome coverage and sample analysis throughput.",

        "Abstract": "We report on the development and characterization of automated metal-free multiple-column nanoLC instrumentation for sensitive and high-throughput analysis of phosphopeptides with mass spectrometry. The system employs a multiple-column capillary LC fluidic design developed for high-throughput analysis of peptides (Anal. Chem. 2001, 73, 3011-3021), incorporating modifications to achieve broad and sensitive analysis of phosphopeptides. The integrated nanoLC columns (50 microm i.d. x 30 cm containing 5 microm C18 particles) and the on-line solid phase extraction columns (150 microm i.d. x 4 cm containing 5 microm C18 particles) were connected to automatic switching valves with non-metal chromatographic accessories, and other modifications to avoid the exposure of the analyte to any metal surfaces during handling, separation, and electrospray ionization. The nanoLC developed provided a separation peak capacity of approximately 250 for phosphopeptides (and approximately 400 for normal peptides). A detection limit of 0.4 fmol was obtained when a linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometer (Finnegan LTQ) was coupled to a 50-microm i.d. column of the nanoLC. The separation power and sensitivity provided by the nanoLC-LTQ enabled identification of approximately 4600 phosphopeptide candidates from approximately 60 microg COS-7 cell tryptic digest followed by IMAC enrichment and approximately 520 tyrosine phosphopeptides from approximately 2mg of human T cells digests followed by phosphotyrosine peptide immunoprecipitation.",

        "Abstract": "De novo sequencing is a spectrum analysis approach for mass spectrometry data to discover post-translational modifications in proteins; however, such an approach is still in its infancy and is still not widely applied to proteomic practices due to its limited reliability. In this work, we describe a de novo sequencing approach for the discovery of protein modifications based on identification of the proteome UStags (Shen, Y.; Toli\u0107, N.; Hixson, K. K.; Purvine, S. O.; Pasa-Toli\u0107, L.; Qian, W. J.; Adkins, J. N.; Moore, R. J.; Smith, R. D. Anal. Chem. 2008, 80, 1871-1882). The de novo information was obtained from Fourier-transform tandem mass spectrometry data for peptides and polypeptides from a yeast lysate, and the de novo sequences obtained were selected based on filter levels designed to provide a limited yet high quality subset of UStags. The DNA-predicted database protein sequences were then compared to the UStags, and the differences observed across or in the UStags (i.e., the UStags' prefix and suffix sequences and the UStags themselves) were used to infer possible sequence modifications. With this de novo-UStag approach, we uncovered some unexpected variances within several yeast protein sequences due to amino acid mutations and/or multiple modifications to the predicted protein sequences. To determine false discovery rates, two random (false) databases were independently used for sequence matching, and ~3% false discovery rates were estimated for the de novo-UStag approach. The factors affecting the reliability (e.g., existence of de novo sequencing noise residues and redundant sequences) and the sensitivity of the approach were investigated and described. The combined de novo-UStag approach complements the UStag method previously reported by enabling the discovery of new protein modifications.",

Here, we study the protein degradation in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells on a proteome-wide scale by detection of the intermediate peptides produced from the intracellular degradation of proteins using sequencing-based tandem mass spectrometry. By tracing the detected approximately 1100 peptides and their approximately 200 protein-substrate origins we obtain evidence for new insights into the proteome-wide protein-selective degradation in yeast cells. This evidence shows that the yeast cytoplasm is the largest pool for the degradation of proteins with both biochemical and geometric specificities, whereas the yeast nucleus seems to be a proteolysis-inert organelle under the condition studied. Yeast V-ATPase subunits appear to be degraded during their disassembly, and yeast mitochondrial proteins functioning as precursors, transport carriers, and gates are preferentially degraded. Ubiquitylation may be unnecessary for the proteasomal degradation of yeast cytoplasmic regulatory and enzyme proteins according to our observations. This study shows that the intracellular peptides are informational targets for directly probing the protein degradation-involved molecular mechanisms and cell biology processes.",

        "Title": "The complete genome of an individual by massively parallel DNA sequencing.",
        "Abstract": "The association of genetic variation with disease and drug response, and improvements in nucleic acid technologies, have given great optimism for the impact of 'genomic medicine'. However, the formidable size of the diploid human genome, approximately 6 gigabases, has prevented the routine application of sequencing methods to deciphering complete individual human genomes. To realize the full potential of genomics for human health, this limitation must be overcome. Here we report the DNA sequence of a diploid genome of a single individual, James D. Watson, sequenced to 7.4-fold redundancy in two months using massively parallel sequencing in picolitre-size reaction vessels. This sequence was completed in two months at approximately one-hundredth of the cost of traditional capillary electrophoresis methods. Comparison of the sequence to the reference genome led to the identification of 3.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, of which 10,654 cause amino-acid substitution within the coding sequence. In addition, we accurately identified small-scale (2-40,000 base pair (bp)) insertion and deletion polymorphism as well as copy number variation resulting in the large-scale gain and loss of chromosomal segments ranging from 26,000 to 1.5 million base pairs. Overall, these results agree well with recent results of sequencing of a single individual by traditional methods. However, in addition to being faster and significantly less expensive, this sequencing technology avoids the arbitrary loss of genomic sequences inherent in random shotgun sequencing by bacterial cloning because it amplifies DNA in a cell-free system. As a result, we further demonstrate the acquisition of novel human sequence, including novel genes not previously identified by traditional genomic sequencing. This is the first genome sequenced by next-generation technologies. Therefore it is a pilot for the future challenges of 'personalized genome sequencing'.",

        "Abstract": "Identifying proteins and their modification states and with known levels of confidence remains as a significant challenge for proteomics. Random or decoy peptide databases are increasingly being used to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR), e.g., from liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses of tryptic digests. We show that this approach can significantly underestimate the FDR and describe an approach for more confident protein identifications that uses unique partial sequences derived from a combination of database searching and amino acid residue sequencing using high-accuracy MS/MS data. Applied to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae tryptic digest, the approach provided 3 132 confident peptide identifications ( approximately 5% modified in some fashion), covering 575 proteins with an estimated zero FDR. The conventional approach provided 3 359 peptide identifications and 656 proteins with 0.3% FDR based upon a decoy database analysis. However, the present approach revealed approximately 5% of the 3 359 identifications to be incorrect and many more as potentially ambiguous (e.g., due to not considering certain amino acid substitutions and modifications). In addition, 677 peptides and 39 proteins were identified that had been missed by conventional analysis, including nontryptic peptides, peptides with a variety of expected/unexpected chemical modifications, known/unknown post-translational modifications, single nucleotide polymorphisms or gene encoding errors, and multiple modifications of individual peptides.",

This system performs multiple LC separations in parallel, but staggers each of them such that the data-rich region of each separation is sampled sequentially. By allowing nearly continuous data acquisition, this design maximizes the use of the mass spectrometer. Each analytical column is connected to a corresponding ESI emitter in order to avoid the use of postcolumn switching and associated dead volume issues. Encoding translation stages are employed to sequentially position the emitters at the MS inlet. The high reproducibility of this system is demonstrated using consecutive analyses of global tryptic digest of the microbe Shewanella oneidensis.",

Observed peptide elution time shifts for a single phosphorylation ranged from -5.28 min (for pYVPML) to +0.59 min (for HRDpSGLLDSLGR). Peptides containing a phosphotyrosine residue displayed a significant decrease in elution time following phosphorylation compared to their similar-sized peptides with phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residues. While peptide phosphorylation generally led to a decrease in the observed elution time, five peptides displayed increased elution times as a result of phosphorylation. For large peptides (> or =18 amino acids), the elution time shifts due to single phosphorylation were limited (ranging between -0.48 and +0.03 min), while the elution time shifts for small peptides (<18 amino acids) were characterized by a larger deviation (ranging between -5.28 and +0.59 min). The predictive capability for the observed RPLC elution time change due to phosphorylation has been suggested, which will aid in assigning confident phosphopeptide identifications and their subsequent confirmation.",

        "Abstract": "We have developed an efficient and robust high-pressure capillary LC-MS method for the identification of large numbers of metabolites in biological samples using both positive and negative ESI modes. Initial efforts focused on optimizing the separation conditions for metabolite extracts using various LC stationary phases in conjunction with multiple mobile-phase systems, as applied to the separation of 45 metabolite standards. The optimal mobile and stationary phases of those tested were determined experimentally (in terms of peak shapes, theoretical plates, retention of small, polar compounds, etc.), and both linear and exponential gradients were applied in the study of metabolite extracts from the cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142. Finally, an automated dual-capillary LC system was constructed and evaluated for the effectiveness and reproducibility of the chromatographic separations using the above samples. When coupled with a commercial LTQ-orbitrap MS, approximately 900 features were reproducibly detected from Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 metabolite extracts. In addition, 12 compounds were tentatively identified, based on accurate mass, isotopic distribution, and MS/MS information.",

Emphasis is placed on recent developments in high-efficiency LC separations, sensitive electrospray ionization approaches, and the benefits to incorporating both in LC-MS-based approaches. The advantages and disadvantages of various quantitative approaches are reviewed, followed by the current LC-MS-based tools available for candidate biomarker characterization and identification.

        "Abstract": "The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is an abundant primate species that diverged from the ancestors of Homo sapiens about 25 million years ago. Because they are genetically and physiologically similar to humans, rhesus monkeys are the most widely used nonhuman primate in basic and applied biomedical research. We determined the genome sequence of an Indian-origin Macaca mulatta female and compared the data with chimpanzees and humans to reveal the structure of ancestral primate genomes and to identify evidence for positive selection and lineage-specific expansions and contractions of gene families. A comparison of sequences from individual animals was used to investigate their underlying genetic diversity. The complete description of the macaque genome blueprint enhances the utility of this animal model for biomedical research and improves our understanding of the basic biology of the species.",

        "Abstract": "Sea urchins have proved fascinating to biologists since the time of Aristotle who compared the appearance of their bony mouth structure to a lantern in The History of Animals. Throughout modern times it has been a model system for research in developmental biology. Now, the genome of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus is the first echinoderm genome to be sequenced. A high quality draft sequence assembly was produced using the Atlas assembler to combine whole genome shotgun sequences with sequences from a collection of BACs selected to form a minimal tiling path along the genome. A formidable challenge was presented by the high degree of heterozygosity between the two haplotypes of the selected male representative of this marine organism. This was overcome by use of the BAC tiling path backbone, in which each BAC represents a single haplotype, as well as by improvements in the Atlas software. Another innovation introduced in this project was the sequencing of pools of tiling path BACs rather than individual BAC sequencing. The Clone-Array Pooled Shotgun Strategy greatly reduced the cost and time devoted to preparing shotgun libraries from BAC clones. The genome sequence was analyzed with several gene prediction methods to produce a comprehensive gene list that was then manually refined and annotated by a volunteer team of sea urchin experts. This latter annotation community edited over 9000 gene models and uncovered many unexpected aspects of the sea urchin genetic content impacting transcriptional regulation, immunology, sensory perception, and an organism's development. Analysis of the basic deuterostome genetic complement supports the sea urchin's role as a model system for deuterostome and, by extension, chordate development.",

The sequencing strategy combined whole-genome shotgun and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences. This use of BAC clones, aided by a pooling strategy, overcame difficulties associated with high heterozygosity of the genome. The genome encodes about 23,300 genes, including many previously thought to be vertebrate innovations or known only outside the deuterostomes. This echinoderm genome provides an evolutionary outgroup for the chordates and yields insights into the evolution of deuterostomes.",

        "Abstract": "The sensitivity of proteomics measurements using liquid chromatography (LC) separations interfaced with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) improves approximately inversely with liquid flow rate (for the columns having the same separation efficiency, linear velocity, and porosity), making attractive the use of smaller inner diameter LC columns. We report the development and initial application of 10 microm i.d. silica-based monolithic LC columns providing more sensitive proteomics measurements. A 50-microm-i.d. micro solid-phase extraction precolumn was used for ease of sample injection and cleanup prior to the reversed-phase LC separation, enabling the sample volume loading speed to be increased by approximately 50-fold. Greater than 10-fold improvement in sensitivity was obtained compared to analyses using more conventional capillary LC, enabling e.g. the identification of >5000 different peptides by MS/MS from 100-ng of a Shewanella oneidensis tryptic digest using an ion trap MS. The low nL/min LC flow rates provide more uniform responses for different peptides, and provided improved quantitative measurements compared to conventional separation systems without the use of internal standards or isotopic labeling. The improved sensitivity allowed LC-MS measurements of immunopurified protein phosphatase 5 that were in good agreement with quantitative Western blot analyses.",

LC-MS/MS was used to initially identify peptide sequences, and LC-FTICR was used to confirm these identifications as well as measure relative peptide abundances. 2343 peptides covering 668 proteins were identified with high confidence and quantified. Among these proteins, a subset of 56 changed significantly using statistical approaches such as statistical analysis of microarrays, whereas another subset of 56 that were annotated as performing housekeeping functions remained essentially unchanged in relative abundance. Numerous proteins involved in anaerobic energy metabolism exhibited up to a 10-fold increase in relative abundance when S. oneidensis was transitioned from aerobic to suboxic conditions.",

        "Abstract": "The throughput of proteomics measurements that provide broad protein coverage is limited by the quality and speed of both the separations as well as the subsequent mass spectrometric analysis; at present, analysis times can range anywhere from hours (high throughput) to days or longer (low throughput). We have explored the basis for proteomics analyses conducted on the order of minutes using high-speed capillary RPLC combined through on-line electrospray ionization interface with high-accuracy mass spectrometry (MS) measurements. Short 0.8-microm porous C18 particle-packed 50-microm-i.d. capillaries were used to speed the RPLC separations while still providing high-quality separations. Both time-of-flight (TOF) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) MS were applied for identifying peptides using the accurate mass and time (AMT) tag approach. Peptide RPLC relative retention (elution) times that were generated by solvent gradients that differed by at least 25-fold were found to provide relative elution times that agreed to within 5%, which provides the basis for using peptide AMT tags for higher throughput proteomics measurements. For fast MS acquisition speeds (e.g., 0.2 s for TOF and either approximately 0.3 or approximately 0.6 s for FTICR), peptide mass measurement accuracies of better than +/-15 ppm were obtained with the high-speed RPLC separations. The ability to identify peptides and the overall proteome coverage was determined by factors that include the separation peak capacity, the sensitivity of the MS (with fast scanning), and the accuracy of both the mass measurements and the relative RPLC peptide elution times. The experimental RPLC relative elution time accuracies of 5% (using high-speed capillary RPLC) and mass measurement accuracies of better than +/-15 ppm allowed for the confident identification of >2800 peptides and >760 proteins from >13,000 different putative peptides detected from a Shewanellaoneidensis tryptic digest. Initial results for both RPLC-ESI-TOF and RPLC-ESI-FTICR MS were similar, with approximately 2000 different peptides from approximately 600 different proteins identified within 2-3 min. For <120-s proteomic analysis, TOF MS analyses were more effective, while FTICR MS was more effective for the >150-s analysis due to the improved mass accuracies attained using longer spectrum acquisition times.",

        "Abstract": "We describe approaches for proteomics analysis using electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry coupled with fast reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) separations. The RPLC separations used 50-microm-i.d. fused-silica capillaries packed with submicrometer-sized C18-bonded porous silica particles and achieved peak capacities of 130-420 for analytes from proteome tryptic digests. When these separations were combined with linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometry measurements, approximately 1000 proteins could be identified in 50 min from approximately 4000 identified tryptic peptides; approximately 550 proteins in 20 min from approximately 1800 peptides; and approximately 250 proteins in 8 min from approximately 700 peptides for a S. oneidensis tryptic digest. The dynamic range for protein identification with the fast separations was determined to be approximately 3-4 orders of magnitude of relative protein abundance on the basis of known proteins in human blood plasma analyses. We found that 55% of the MS/MS spectra acquired during the entire analysis (and up to 100% of the MS/MS spectra acquired from the most data-rich zone) provided sufficient quality for identifying peptides. The results confirm that such analyses using very fast (minutes) RPLC separations based on columns packed with microsized porous particles are primarily limited by the MS/MS analysis speed.",

The combination of stepwise immunoglobulin G (IgG) and albumin protein depletion by affinity chromatography and ultrahigh-efficiency capillary liquid chromatography separations coupled to ion trap-tandem mass spectrometry enabled identification of 2392 proteins from a single plasma sample with an estimated confidence level of > 94%, and an additional 2198 proteins with an estimated confidence level of 80%. The relative abundances of the identified proteins span a range of over eight orders of magnitude in concentration (< 30 pg/mL to approximately 30 mg/mL), facilitated by the attomole-level sensitivity of the analysis methods. More than 80% of the observed proteins demonstrate interactions with IgG and/or albumin, and the human plasma protein loss in the affinity chromatography/strong cation exchange/reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methodology was investigated in detail.

        "Abstract": "Candidate proteomic biomarker discovery from human plasma holds both incredible clinical potential as well as significant challenges. The dynamic range of proteins within plasma is known to exceed 10(10), and many potential biomarkers are likely present at lower protein abundances. At present, proteomic based MS analyses provide a dynamic range typically not exceeding approximately 10(3) in a single spectrum, and approximately 10(4)-10(6) when combined with on-line separations (e.g., reversed-phase gradient liquid chromatography), and thus are generally insufficient for low level biomarker detection directly from human plasma. This limitation is providing an impetus for the development of experimental methodologies and strategies to increase the possible number of detections within this biofluid. Discussed is the diversity of available approaches currently used by our laboratory and others to utilize human plasma as a viable medium for biomarker discovery. Various separation, depletion, enrichment, and quantitative efforts as well as recent improvements in MS capabilities have resulted in measurable improvements in the detection and identification of lower abundance proteins (by approximately 10-10(2)). Despite these improvements, further advances are needed to provide a basis for discovery of candidate biomarkers at very low levels. Continued development of depletion and enrichment techniques, coupled with improved pre-MS separations (both at the protein and peptide level) holds promise in extending the dynamic range of proteomic analysis.",

The sensitivity and separation efficiency enabled the identification of 2367 different peptides covering 855 distinct S. oneidensis proteins from a 2.5-microg tryptic digest sample in a single 10-h analysis. The number of identified peptides and proteins approximately doubled when the effective separation time was extended from 200 to 600 min. The number of identified peptides increased from 32 to 390 as the injection amount was increased from 0.5 to 100 ng. Both the run-to-run and column-to-column reproducibility for proteomic analyses were also evaluated.",

        "Abstract": "Characterization of the human blood plasma proteome is critical to the discovery of routinely useful clinical biomarkers. We used an accurate mass and time (AMT) tag strategy with high-resolution mass accuracy cLC-FT-ICR MS to perform a global proteomic analysis of pilot study samples as part of the HUPO Plasma Proteome Project. HUPO reference serum and citrated plasma samples from African Americans, Asian Americans, and Caucasian Americans were analyzed, in addition to a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory reference serum and plasma. The AMT tag strategy allowed us to leverage two previously published \"shotgun\" proteomics experiments to perform global analyses on these samples in triplicate in less than 4 days total analysis time. A total of 722 (22% with multiple peptide identifications) International Protein Index redundant proteins, or 377 protein families by ProteinProphet, were identified over the six individual HUPO serum and plasma samples. The samples yielded a similar number of identified redundant proteins in the plasma samples (average 446 +/- 23) as found in the serum samples (average 440 +/- 20). These proteins were identified by an average of 956 +/- 35 unique peptides in plasma and 930 +/- 11 unique peptides in serum. In addition to this high-throughput analysis, the AMT tag approach was used with a Z-score normalization to compare relative protein abundances. This analysis highlighted both known differences in serum and citrated plasma such as fibrinogens, and reproducible differences in peptide abundances from proteins such as soluble activin receptor-like kinase 7b and glycoprotein m6b. The AMT tag strategy not only improved our sample throughput but also provided a basis for estimated quantitation.",

        "Abstract": "Recent developments in combined separations with mass spectrometry for sensitive and high-throughput proteomic analyses are reviewed herein. These developments primarily involve high-efficiency (separation peak capacities of approximately 10(3)) nanoscale liquid chromatography (flow rates extending down to approximately 20 nl/min at optimal liquid mobile-phase separation linear velocities through narrow packed capillaries) in combination with advanced mass spectrometry and in particular, high-sensitivity and high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Such approaches enable analysis of low nanogram level proteomic samples (i.e., nanoscale proteomics) with individual protein identification sensitivity at the low zeptomole level. The resultant protein measurement dynamic range can approach 10(6) for nanogram-sized proteomic samples, while more abundant proteins can be detected from subpicogram-sized (total) proteome samples. These qualities provide the foundation for proteomics studies of single or small populations of cells. The instrumental robustness required for automation and providing high-quality routine performance nanoscale proteomic analyses is also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Proteomics analysis based-on reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is widely practiced; however, variations providing cutting-edge RPLC performance have generally not been adopted even though their benefits are well established. Here, we describe an automated format 20 kpsi RPLC system for proteomics and metabolomics that includes on-line coupling of micro-solid phase extraction for sample loading and allows electrospray ionization emitters to be readily replaced. The system uses 50 microm i.d. x 40-200 cm fused-silica capillaries packed with 1.4-3-microm porous C18-bonded silica particles to obtain chromatographic peak capacities of 1000-1500 for complex peptide and metabolite mixtures. This separation quality provided high-confidence identifications of >12 000 different tryptic peptides from >2000 distinct Shewanella oneidensis proteins (approximately 40% of the proteins predicted for the S. oneidensis proteome) in a single 12-h ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis. The protein identification reproducibility approached 90% between replicate experiments. The average protein MS/MS identification rate exceeded 10 proteins/min, and 1207 proteins were identified in 120 min through assignment of 5944 different peptides. The proteomic analysis dynamic range of the 20 kpsi RPLC-ion trap MS/MS was approximately 10(6) based on analyses of a human blood plasma sample, for which 835 distinct proteins were identified with high confidence in a single 12-h run. A single run of the 20 kpsi RPLC-accurate mass MS detected >5000 different compounds from a metabolomics sample.",

        "Abstract": "Identification of novel diagnostic or therapeutic biomarkers from human blood plasma would benefit significantly from quantitative measurements of the proteome constituents over a range of physiological conditions. Herein we describe an initial demonstration of proteome-wide quantitative analysis of human plasma. The approach utilizes postdigestion trypsin-catalyzed 16O/18O peptide labeling, two-dimensional LC-FTICR mass spectrometry, and the accurate mass and time (AMT) tag strategy to identify and quantify peptides/proteins from complex samples. A peptide accurate mass and LC elution time AMT tag data base was initially generated using MS/MS following extensive multidimensional LC separations to provide the basis for subsequent peptide identifications. The AMT tag data base contains >8,000 putative identified peptides, providing 938 confident plasma protein identifications. The quantitative approach was applied without depletion of high abundance proteins for comparative analyses of plasma samples from an individual prior to and 9 h after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. Accurate quantification of changes in protein abundance was demonstrated by both 1:1 labeling of control plasma and the comparison between the plasma samples following LPS administration. A total of 429 distinct plasma proteins were quantified from the comparative analyses, and the protein abundances for 25 proteins, including several known inflammatory response mediators, were observed to change significantly following LPS administration.",

        "Abstract": "In proteomics, effective methods are needed for identifying the relatively limited subset of proteins displaying significant changes in abundance between two samples. One way to accomplish this task is to target for identification by MS/MS only the \"interesting\" proteins based on the abundance ratio of isotopically labeled pairs of peptides. We have developed the software and hardware tools for online LC-FTICR MS/MS studies in which a set of initially unidentified peptides from a proteome analysis can be selected for identification based on their distinctive changes in abundance following a \"perturbation\". We report here the validation of this method using a mixture of standard proteins combined in different ratios after isotopic labeling. We also demonstrate the application of this method to the identification of Shewanella oneidensis peptides/proteins exhibiting differential abundance in suboxic versus aerobic cell cultures.",

        "Abstract": "An accurate mass and time (AMT) tag approach for proteomic analyses has been developed over the past several years to facilitate comprehensive high-throughput proteomic measurements. An AMT tag database for an organism, tissue, or cell line is established by initially performing standard shotgun proteomic analysis and, most importantly, by validating peptide identifications using the mass measurement accuracy of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography (LC) elution time constraint. Creation of an AMT tag database largely obviates the need for subsequent MS/MS analyses, and thus facilitates high-throughput analyses. The strength of this technology resides in the ability to achieve highly efficient and reproducible one-dimensional reversed-phased LC separations in conjunction with highly accurate mass measurements using FTICR MS. Recent improvements allow for the analysis of as little as picrogram amounts of proteome samples by minimizing sample handling and maximizing peptide recovery. The nanoproteomics platform has also demonstrated the ability to detect >10(6) differences in protein abundances and identify more abundant proteins from subpicogram amounts of samples. The AMT tag approach is poised to become a new standard technique for the in-depth and high-throughput analysis of complex organisms and clinical samples, with the potential to extend the analysis to a single mammalian cell.",

        "Title": "Application of peptide LC retention time information in a discriminant function for peptide identification by tandem mass spectrometry.",
        "Abstract": "We describe the application of a peptide retention time reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) prediction model previously reported (Petritis et al. Anal. Chem. 2003, 75, 1039) for improved peptide identification. The model uses peptide sequence information to generate a theoretical (predicted) elution time that can be compared with the observed elution time. Using data from a set of known proteins, the retention time parameter was incorporated into a discriminant function for use with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data analyzed with the peptide/protein identification program SEQUEST. For singly charged ions, the number of confident identifications increased by 12% when the elution time metric is included compared to when mass spectral data is the sole source of information in the context of a Drosophila melanogaster database. A 3-4% improvement was obtained for doubly and triply charged ions for the same biological system. Application to the larger Rattus norvegicus (rat) and human proteome databases resulted in an 8-9% overall increase in the number of confident identifications, when both the discriminant function and elution time are used. The effect of adding \"runner-up\" hits (peptide matches that are not the highest scoring for a spectra) from SEQUEST is also explored, and we find that the number of confident identifications is further increased by 1% when these hits are also considered. Finally, application of the discriminant functions derived in this work with approximately 2.2 million spectra from over three hundred LC-MS/MS analyses of peptides from human plasma protein resulted in a 16% increase in confident peptide identifications (9022 vs 7779) using elution time information. Further improvements from the use of elution time information can be expected as both the experimental control of elution time reproducibility and the predictive capability are improved.",

        "Abstract": "Ultrasensitive nanoscale proteomics approaches for characterizing proteins from complex proteomic samples of <50 ng of total mass are described. Protein identifications from 0.5 pg of whole proteome extracts were enabled by ultrahigh sensitivity (<75 zmol for individual proteins) achieved using high-efficiency (peak capacities of approximately 10(3)) 15-microm-i.d. capillary liquid chromatography separations (i.e., using nanoLC, approximately 20 nL/min mobile-phase flow rate at the optimal linear velocity of approximately 0.2 cm/s) coupled on-line with a micro-solid-phase sample extraction and a nanoscale electrospray ionization interface to a 11.4-T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer (MS). Proteome measurement coverage improved as sample size was increased from as little as 0.5 pg of sample. It was found that a 2.5-ng sample provided 14% coverage of all annotated open reading frames for the microorganism Deinococcus radiodurans, consistent with previous results for a specific culture condition. The estimated detection dynamic range for detected proteins was 10(5)-10(6). An improved accurate mass and LC elution time two-dimensional data analysis methodology, used to both speed and increase the confidence of peptide/protein identifications, enabled identification of 872 proteins/run from a single 3-h nanoLC/FTICR MS analysis. The low-zeptomole-level sensitivity provides a basis for extending proteomics studies to smaller cell populations and potentially to a single mammalian cell. Application with ion trap MS/MS instrumentation allowed protein identification from 50 pg (total mass) of proteomic samples (i.e., approximately 100 times larger than FTICR MS), corresponding to a sensitivity of approximately 7 amol for individual proteins. Compared with single-stage FTICR measurements, ion trap MS/MS provided a much lower proteome measurement coverage and dynamic range for a given analysis time and sample quantity.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to manipulate and effectively utilize small proteomic samples is important for analyses using liquid chromatography (LC) in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) and becomes more challenging for very low flow rates due to extra column volume effects on separation quality. Here we report on the use of commercial switching valves (150-microm channels) for implementing the on-line coupling of capillary LC columns operated at 10,000 psi with relatively large solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns. With the use of optimized column connections, switching modes, and SPE column dimensions, high-efficiency on-line SPE-capillary and nanoscale LC separations were obtained demonstrating peak capacities of approximately 1000 for capillaries having inner diameters between 15 and 150 microm. The on-line coupled SPE columns increased the sample processing capacity by approximately 400-fold for sample solution volume and approximately 10-fold for sample mass. The proteomic applications of this on-line SPE-capillary LC system were evaluated for analysis of both soluble and membrane protein tryptic digests. Using an ion trap tandem MS it was typically feasible to identify 1100-1500 unique peptides in a 5-h analysis. Peptides extracted from the SPE column and then eluted from the LC column covered a hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity range that included an estimated approximately 98% of all tryptic peptides. The SPE-capillary LC implementation also facilitates automation and enables use of both disposable SPE columns and electrospray emitters, providing a robust basis for automated proteomic analyses.",

        "Abstract": "The use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is described for predicting the reversed-phase liquid chromatography retention times of peptides enzymatically digested from proteome-wide proteins. To enable the accurate comparison of the numerous LC/MS data sets, a genetic algorithm was developed to normalize the peptide retention data into a range (from 0 to 1), improving the peptide elution time reproducibility to approximately 1%. The network developed in this study was based on amino acid residue composition and consists of 20 input nodes, 2 hidden nodes, and 1 output node. A data set of approximately 7000 confidently identified peptides from the microorganism Deinococcus radiodurans was used for the training of the ANN. The ANN was then used to predict the elution times for another set of 5200 peptides tentatively identified by MS/MS from a different microorganism (Shewanella oneidensis). The model was found to predict the elution times of peptides with up to 54 amino acid residues (the longest peptide identified after tryptic digestion of S. oneidensis) with an average accuracy of approximately 3%. This predictive capability was then used to distinguish with high confidence isobar peptides otherwise indistinguishable by accurate mass measurements as well as to uncover peptide misidentifications. Thus, integration of ANN peptide elution time prediction in the proteomic research will increase both the number of protein identifications and their confidence.",

Lysine auxotrophic yeast was grown in the presence of 13C-labeled or unlabeled lysine and combined after harvesting in equal proportions. Endoproteinase LysC digestion of the cytosolic fraction produced a global proteomic sample, consisting of heavy/light labeled peptide pairs. Then data-dependent multiplexed-MS/MS was applied to simultaneously select and dissociate only labeled peptide ion pairs. The approach allows differentiation between N-terminal (e.g., b-type ions) and C-terminal fragment ions (e.g., y-type ions) in resulting tandem mass spectra, as well as the capability of differentiation between near-isobaric glutamine and lysine residues. We also describe the utility of peptide composition and fragment information to support peptide identifications and examine the potential application of lysine labeling for differential quantitative protein analysis.",

        "Title": "Integration of capillary isoelectric focusing with capillary reversed-phase liquid chromatography for two-dimensional proteomics separation.",
        "Abstract": "On-line combination of capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF) with capillary reversed-phase liquid chromatography (CRPLC) is developed using a microinjector as the interface for performing two-dimensional (2-D) protein/peptide separations of complex protein mixtures. The focusing effect of CIEF not only contributes to a high-resolution protein/peptide separation, but also may permit the analysis of low-abundance proteins with a typical concentration factor of 50-100 times. The preparative capabilities of CIEF are much larger than most of capillary-based electrokinetic separation techniques since the entire capillary is initially filled with a solution containing proteins/peptides and carrier ampholytes for the creation of a pH gradient inside the capillary. The focused peptides which have a similar pI are coinjected into the second separation dimension and further resolved by their differences in hydrophobicity. The resolving power of combined CIEF-CRPLC system is demonstrated using the soluble fraction of Drosophila salivary glands taken from a period beginning before steroid-triggered programmed cell death and extending to its completion. The separation mechanisms of CIEF and CRPLC are completely orthogonal and the overall peak capacity is estimated to be around approximately 1800 over a run time of less than 8 h. Significant enhancement in the separation peak capacity can be realized by further increasing the number of CIEF fractions and/or slowing the solvent gradient in CRPLC, however, at the expense of overall analysis time. The results of our preliminary studies display significant differences in the separation profiles of peptide samples obtained from salivary glands of animals staged at the 6 and 12 h following puparium formation.",

        "Abstract": "Identifying and quantifying in a high throughput manner the proteins expressed by cells, tissues or an organism provides the basis for understanding the functions of its constituents at a \"systems\" level. As a result, proteome analysis has increasingly become the focus of significant interest and research over the past decade. This is especially true following the recent stunning achievements in genomics analyses. However, unlike the static genome, the complexities and dynamism of the proteome present significant analytical challenges and demand highly efficient separations and detection technologies. A number of recent technological advancements have been in direct response to these challenges. Currently, strategically mated combinations of sophisticated separations techniques and advanced mass spectrometric detection represent the best approach to addressing the intricacies of the proteome. Liquid-phase separations, often within capillaries, are increasingly recognized as the best separations technique for this approach. In combination on-line with mass spectrometry, liquid-phase separations provide the improved analytical sensitivity, sample throughput, and quantitation capabilities necessitated by the multifaceted problems within proteomics analyses. This review focuses primarily on current high-efficiency capillary separations techniques, including both capillary liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis, applied to the analysis of complex proteomic samples. We emphasize developments at our laboratory and illustrate technical advances that attempt to review the role of separations within the broader context of a state-of-the-art integrated proteomics effort.",

        "Title": "Increased proteome coverage for quantitative peptide abundance measurements based upon high performance separations and DREAMS FTICR mass spectrometry.",
        "Abstract": "A primary challenge in proteome measurements is to be able to detect, identify, and quantify the extremely complex mixtures of proteins. The relative abundances of interest span at least six orders of magnitude for mammalian proteomes, and this constitutes an intractable challenge for high throughput proteome studies. We have recently described a new approach, Dynamic Range Enhancement Applied to Mass Spectrometry (DREAMS), which is based upon the selective ejection of the most abundant species to expand the dynamic range of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonanace (FTICR) measurements. The basis of our approach is on-the-fly data-dependent selective ejection of highly abundant species, followed by prolonged accumulation of remaining low-abundance species in a quadrupole external to the FTICR ion trap. Here we report the initial implementation of this approach with high efficiency capillary reverse phase LC separations and high magnetic field electrospray ionization FTICR mass spectrometry for obtaining enhanced coverage in quantitative measurements for mammalian proteomes. We describe the analysis of a sample derived from a tryptic digest of proteins from mouse B16 cells cultured in both natural isotopic abundance and 15N-labeled media. The FTICR mass spectrometric analysis allows the assignment of peptide pairs (corresponding to the two distinctive versions of each peptide), and thus provides the basis for quantiative measurements when one of the two proteomes in the mixture is perturbed or altered in some fashion. We show that implementation of the DREAMS approach allows assignment of approximately 80% more peptide pairs, thus providing quantitative information for approximately 18,000 peptide pairs in a single analysis.",

        "Title": "High-efficiency nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled on-line with mass spectrometry using nanoelectrospray ionization for proteomics.",
        "Abstract": "We describe high-efficiency (peak capacities of approximately 10(3)) nanoscale (using column inner diameters down to 15 microm) liquid chromatography (nanoLC)/low flow rate electrospray (nanoESI) mass spectrometry (MS) for the sensitive analysis of complex global cellular protein enzymatic digests (i.e., proteomics). Using a liquid slurry packing method with carefully selected packing solvents, 87-cm-length capillaries having inner diameters of 14.9-74.5 microm were successfully packed with 3-microm C18-bonded porous (300-A pores) silica particles at a pressure of 18,000 psi. With a mobile-phase delivery pressure of 10,000 psi, these packed capillaries provided mobile-phase flow rates as low as approximately 20 nL/min at LC linear velocities of approximately 0.2 cm/s, which is near optimal for separation efficiency. To maintain chromatographic efficiency, unions with internal channel diameters as small as 10 microm were specially produced for connecting packed capillaries to replaceable nanoESI emitters having orifice diameters of 2-10 microm (depending on the packed capillary dimensions). Coupled on-line with a hybrid-quadrupole time-of-flight MS through the nanoESI interface, the nanoLC separations provided peak capacities of approximately 10(3) for proteome proteolytic polypeptide mixtures when a positive feedback switching valve was used for quantitatively introducing samples. Over a relatively large range of sample loadings (e.g., 5-100 ng, and 50-500 ng of cellular proteolytic peptides for 14.9- and 29.7-microm-i.d. packed capillaries, respectively), the nanoLC/nanoESI MS response for low-abundance components of the complex mixtures was found to increase linearly with sample loading. The nanoLC/nanoESI-MS sensitivity also increased linearly with decreasing flow rate (or approximately inversely proportional to the square of the capillary inner diameter) in the flow range of 20-400 nL/min. Thus, except at the lower loadings, decreasing the separation capillary inner diameter has an effect equivalent to increasing sample loading, which is important for sample-limited proteomic applications. No significant effects on recovery of eluting polypeptides were observed using porous C18 particles with surface pores of 300-A versus nonporous particles. Tandem MS analyses were also demonstrated using the high-efficiency nanoLC separations. Chromatographic elution time, MS response intensity, and mass measurement accuracy was examined between runs with a single column (with a single nanoESI emitter), between different columns (same and different inner diameters with different nanoESI emitters), and for different samples (various concentrations of cellular proteolytic peptides) and demonstrated robust and reproducible sensitive analyses for complex proteomic samples.",

The two-stage strategy exploits Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry to validate peptide AMTs for a specific organism, tissue or cell type from \"potential mass tags\" identified using conventional tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methods, providing greater confidence in identifications as well as the basis for subsequent measurements without the need for MS/MS, and thus with greater sensitivity and increased throughput. A single high resolution capillary liquid chromatography separation combined with high sensitivity, high resolution and accurate FT-ICR measurements has been shown capable of characterizing peptide mixtures of significantly more than 10(5) components with mass accuracies of < 1 ppm, sufficient for broad protein identification using AMTs. Other attractions of the approach include the broad and relatively unbiased proteome coverage, the capability for exploiting stable isotope labeling methods to realize high precision for relative protein abundance measurements, and the projected potential for study of mammalian proteomes when combined with additional sample fractionation. Using this strategy, in our first application we have been able to identify AMTs for >60% of the potentially expressed proteins in the organism Deinococcus radiodurans.",

        "Abstract": "Electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry coupled with capillary reverse-phase liquid chromatography was used to characterize intact proteins from the large subunit of the yeast ribosome. High mass measurement accuracy, achieved by \"mass locking\" with an internal standard from a dual electrospray ionization source, allowed identification of ribosomal proteins. Analyses of the intact proteins revealed information on cotranslational and posttranslational modifications of the ribosomal proteins that included loss of the initiating methionine, acetylation, methylation, and proteolytic maturation. High-resolution separations permitted differentiation of protein isoforms having high structural similarity as well as proteins from their modified forms, facilitating unequivocal assignments. The study identified 42 of the 43 core large ribosomal subunit proteins and 58 (of 64 possible) core large subunit protein isoforms having unique masses in a single analysis. These results demonstrate the basis for the high-throughput analyses of complex mixtures of intact proteins, which we believe will be an important complement to other approaches for defining protein modifications and their changes resulting from physiological processes or environmental perturbations.",

        "Abstract": "The pathway of the gating conformational transition of Escherichia coli mechanosensitive channel was simulated, using the recently modeled open and closed structures, by targeted molecular dynamics method. The transition can be roughly viewed as a four-stage process. The initial motion under a lower tension load is predominantly elastic deformation. The opening of the inner hydrophobic pore on a higher tension load takes place after the major expansion of the outer channel dimension. The hypothetical N-terminal S1 helical bundle has been confirmed to form the hydrophobic gate, together with the M1 helices. The sequential breaking of the tandem hydrophobic constrictions on the M1 and S1 helices makes the two parts of the gate strictly coupled, acting as a single gate. The simulation also revealed that there is no significant energetic coupling between the inner S1 bundle and the outer M2 transmembrane helices. The molten-globular-like structural features of the S1 bundle in its intermediate open states may account for the observed multiple subconductance states. Moreover, the intermediate open states of mechanosensitive channels are not symmetric, i.e., the opening does not follow iris-like motion, which sharply contrasts to the potassium channel KcsA.",

        "Abstract": "The gating mechanism of the potassium channel KcsA was studied by normal mode analysis. The results provided an atomic description of the locations of the pivot points and the motional features of key structural elements in the gating process. Two pivot points were found in the motions of the inner TM2 helical bundle that directly modulate the size of the central channel pore. One point is an intrasubunit hinge point that sharply divides the structural flexibility between the more rigid selectivity filter and the more mobile peripheral transmembrane helices. Such a division is vital for KcsA because it permits the large-scale motions of transmembrane helices required for the gating and, in the meantime, maintains the rigidity of the filter region essential for the selectivity. The other pivot point is an intersubunit one at which all four TM2 helices are bundled together. During the gating process, each TM2 helix undergoes a lever-like swinging motion pivoting on the intrasubunit hinge, and the entire TM2 bundle undergoes a concerted rotational motion around the central channel axis constrained around the intersubunit bundle point. This series of motions leads to a dramatic enlargement of the intracellular gate without loosening up the structural integrity.",
