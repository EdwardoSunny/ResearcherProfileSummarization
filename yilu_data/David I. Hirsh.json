        "Abstract": "Microalbuminuria predicts graft loss and death in the renal transplant population. Measurement of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) is recommended for its detection. There is uncertainty regarding the optimal UACR cutoff values. Few studies have examined the accuracy of UACR in the general population and none have been conducted in renal transplant recipients. The aim of this study is to determine the performance of UACR in the renal transplant population.",
