        "Abstract": "BackgroundThere is considerable variability in COVID-19 outcomes among younger adults, and some of this variation may be due to genetic predisposition.MethodsWe combined individual level data from 13,888 COVID-19 patients (n = 7185 hospitalized) from 17 cohorts in 9 countries to assess the association of the major common COVID-19 genetic risk factor (chromosome 3 locus tagged by rs10490770) with mortality, COVID-19-related complications, and laboratory values. We next performed metaanalyses using FinnGen and the Columbia University COVID-19 Biobank.ResultsWe found that rs10490770 risk allele carriers experienced an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.7). Risk allele carriers had increased odds of several COVID-19 complications: severe respiratory failure (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.6), venous thromboembolism (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4), and hepatic injury (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0). Risk allele carriers age 60 years and younger had higher odds of death or severe respiratory failure (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.8-3.9) compared with those of more than 60 years (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8; interaction, P = 0.038). Among individuals 60 years and younger who died or experienced severe respiratory failure, 32.3% were risk-variant carriers compared with 13.9% of those not experiencing these outcomes. This risk variant improved the prediction of death or severe respiratory failure similarly to, or better than, most established clinical risk factors.ConclusionsThe major common COVID-19 genetic risk factor is associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality, which are more pronounced among individuals 60 years or younger. The effect was similar in magnitude and more common than most established clinical risk factors, suggesting potential implications for future clinical risk management.",

        "Abstract": "How clinicians utilize medically actionable genomic information, displayed in the electronic health record (EHR), in medical decision-making remains unknown. Participating sites of the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network have invested resources into EHR integration efforts to enable the display of genetic testing data across heterogeneous EHR systems. To assess clinicians' engagement with unsolicited EHR-integrated genetic test results of eMERGE participants within a large tertiary care academic medical center, we analyzed automatically generated EHR access log data. We found that clinicians viewed only 1% of all the eMERGE genetic test results integrated in the EHR. Using a cluster analysis, we also identified different user traits associated with varying degrees of engagement with the EHR-integrated genomic data. These data contribute important empirical knowledge about clinicians limited and brief engagements with unsolicited EHR-integrated genetic test results of eMERGE participants. Appreciation for user-specific roles provide additional context for why certain users were more or less engaged with the unsolicited results. This study highlights opportunities to use EHR log data as a performance metric to more precisely inform ongoing EHR-integration efforts and decisions about the allocation of informatics resources in genomic research.",

        "Abstract": "Digital medical records have enabled us to employ clinical data in many new and innovative ways. However, these advances have brought with them a complex set of demands for healthcare institutions regarding data sharing with topics such as data ownership, the loss of privacy, and the protection of the intellectual property. The lack of clear guidance from government entities often creates conflicting messages about data policy, leaving institutions to develop guidelines themselves. Through discussions with multiple stakeholders at various institutions, we have generated a set of guidelines with 10 key principles to guide the responsible and appropriate use and sharing of clinical data for the purposes of care and discovery. Industry, universities, and healthcare institutions can build upon these guidelines toward creating a responsible, ethical, and practical response to data sharing.",

        "Abstract": "The advancement of precision medicine requires new methods to coordinate and deliver genetic data from heterogeneous sources to physicians and patients. The eMERGE III Network enrolled >25,000 participants from biobank and prospective cohorts of predominantly healthy individuals for clinical genetic testing to determine clinically actionable findings. The network developed protocols linking together the 11 participant collection sites and 2 clinical genetic testing laboratories. DNA capture panels targeting 109 genes were used for testing of DNA and sample collection, data generation, interpretation, reporting, delivery, and storage were each harmonized. A compliant and secure network enabled ongoing review and reconciliation of clinical interpretations, while maintaining communication and data sharing between clinicians and investigators. A total of 202 individuals had positive diagnostic findings relevant to the indication for testing and 1,294 had additional/secondary findings of medical significance deemed to be returnable, establishing data return rates for other testing endeavors. This study accomplished integration of structured genomic results into multiple electronic health record (EHR) systems, setting the stage for clinical decision support to enable genomic medicine. Further, the established processes enable different sequencing sites to harmonize technical and interpretive aspects of sequencing tests, a critical achievement toward global standardization of genomic testing. The eMERGE protocols and tools are available for widespread dissemination.",

        "Abstract": "The present study undertook the design of nitro and dinitroamino compounds from the skeleton of isomeric N-oxides of octaazanaphthalene, using computational methods to predict their degradation and explosive characteristics. The atom equivalent method was employed to evaluate the gas phase heats of formation of the designed species. Condensed phase heats of formation were also determined and found to be in the range of 220-286 kcal mol(-1). Crystal densities of all the designed molecules were calculated and found to be in the range of 1.91-1.98 g cm(-3). Detonation pressure (P) and detonation velocity (D) determined using the Kamlet-Jacobs equation showed that the performance of nitro-substituted compounds was comparable to that of RDX while that of dinitroamino compounds (P\u2009\u2248\u200943.4-43.7 GPa; D\u2009\u2248\u20099.6-9.7 km s(-1)) showed their superiority over HMX (P\u2009\u2248\u200939.3 GPa and D\u2009\u2248\u20099.10 km s(-1)). Impact sensitivity (h 50) of the designed molecules was compared with nitro- and nitramino-based commercial explosives on the basis of the available free space (\u2206V) per molecule in their crystal lattice estimated using wave function analysis. The study showed that dinitroamino compounds were more sensitive compared to their nitro analogs. Reactivity or chemical stability of the designed molecules were measured in terms of charge distribution, molecular electrostatic potential and frontier molecular orbital energy. The nitro compounds of N-oxides of octaazaanthracene were found to be more stable than their dinitroamino analogs.",

        "Abstract": "Density functional theory calculations of 13 aminonitro compounds based on the benzo[1,2,4]triazine fused-ring system were performed. The geometries of all 13 species were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. In order to refine the energy values, single-point energy calculations of the species were made at the B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p) level. The gas-phase heats of formation of the species considered were calculated using the atom equivalent method. Condensed-phase heats of formation were calculated utilizing the heats of sublimation of the designed molecules, as evaluated during the present study. With the help of the WFA program, crystal densities of the designed compounds were predicted using the geometry of the molecule optimized at the B3PW91/6-31G(d,p) level. The stabilities and impact sensitivities of all of the compounds are discussed in the present paper in terms of the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the trigger linkage (the longest C-NO\u2082 bond) and the available free space per molecule (\u2206V) in the unit cell of each compound. A nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) study was performed to assess the aromaticities of the designed molecules, and the NICS(1) values determined 1 \u00c5 above and below the plane of the ring were found to be -7.9 to -10.5, respectively, for the benzene ring and -10.7 to -11.4, respectively, for the triazine ring in the designed fused-ring molecules, showing that both rings retain their aromaticities when undergoing substitution by nitro groups. Detonation parameters of the species were calculated, and the results suggest that the designed compounds possess comparable values to those of the commercial explosives TNT and RDX. Furthermore, results suggest that the designed compounds may be less sensitive than many nitroaromatic and nitramine explosives. Thus, the results obtained during the present study imply that the designed compounds may be used as safe explosive materials, and could be potential alternatives to TNT and RDX.",

        "Abstract": "CONTEXT Telemedicine is a promising but largely unproven technology for providing case management services to patients with chronic conditions and lower access to care. OBJECTIVES To examine the effectiveness of a telemedicine intervention to achieve clinical management goals in older, ethnically diverse, medically underserved patients with diabetes. DESIGN, Setting, and Patients A randomized controlled trial was conducted, comparing telemedicine case management to usual care, with blinded outcome evaluation, in 1,665 Medicare recipients with diabetes, aged >/= 55 years, residing in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York State. Interventions Home telemedicine unit with nurse case management versus usual care. Main Outcome Measures The primary endpoints assessed over 5 years of follow-up were hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and blood pressure levels. RESULTS Intention-to-treat mixed models showed that telemedicine achieved net overall reductions over five years of follow-up in the primary endpoints (HgbA1c, p = 0.001; LDL, p < 0.001; systolic and diastolic blood pressure, p = 0.024; p < 0.001). Estimated differences (95% CI) in year 5 were 0.29 (0.12, 0.46)% for HgbA1c, 3.84 (-0.08, 7.77) mg/dL for LDL cholesterol, and 4.32 (1.93, 6.72) mm Hg for systolic and 2.64 (1.53, 3.74) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure. There were 176 deaths in the intervention group and 169 in the usual care group (hazard ratio 1.01 [0.82, 1.24]). CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine case management resulted in net improvements in HgbA1c, LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure levels over 5 years in medically underserved Medicare beneficiaries. Mortality was not different between the groups, although power was limited. Trial Registration http://clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00271739.",

We investigated using two different text-processing systems in tandem as a strategy for de-identification of clinical notes. We ran 100 outpatient notes through deid.pl, from MIT's PhysioToolkit, followed by MedLEE, and we manually compared the output with original notes to determine the amount of protected health information (PHI) retained. Pipelining resulted in an overall error rate of 2%, with 2 personal names retained in output: one initial and a commonly used English term used in medicine. All retained PHI was transformed into standardized medical concepts, making re-identification less likely. Pipelining using deid.pl improved performance of MedLEE in excluding PHI from output and may be a useful strategy for de-identifying clinical data while providing computer-readable output.",

        "Abstract": "The advent of electronic medical records and health information exchange raise the possibility of expanding public health reporting to detect a broad range of clinical conditions and of monitoring the health of the public on a broad scale. Expanding public health reporting may require patient anonymity, matching records, re-identifying cases, and recording patient characteristics for localization. The privacy regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) provide several mechanisms for public health surveillance, including using laws and regulations, public health activities, de-identification, research waivers, and limited data sets, and in addition, surveillance may be distributed with aggregate reporting. The appropriateness of these approaches varies with the definition of what data may be included, the requirements of the minimum necessary standard, the accounting of disclosures, and the feasibility of the approach.",

        "Abstract": "Our goal is to assess how clinical information from previous visits is used in the emergency department. We used detailed user audit logs to measure access to different data types. We found that clinician-authored notes and laboratory and radiology data were used most often (common data types were used up to 5% to 20% of the time). Data were accessed less than half the time (up to 20% to 50%) even when the user was alerted to the presence of data. Our access rate indicates that health information exchange projects should be conservative in estimating how often shared data will be used and the wide breadth of data accessed indicates that although a clinical summary is likely to be useful, an ideal solution will supply a broad variety of data.",

To create clinical computing tools that are useful to and used by clinicians, developers of clinical information systems must have accurate models of the users for whom their systems are intended. To create these models, the information needs of clinicians must be understood. While the wireless handheld environment offers many advantages such as the ability to provide mobile access to information, there are a number of challenges. Developing for this environment differs from the laptop and desktop environments due to features such as processing power, screen size, input mechanism, and bandwidth. PalmCIS (Palm-based Clinical Information System) is a clinical application being developed at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) that provides clinicians with access to patient data via a wireless handheld device. We are using an automated technique to uncover patient-specific information needs of clinicians while using a patient record system. With the results, we can enhance PalmCIS.",

        "Abstract": "We consider spacetime with torsion in a Randall-Sundrum scenario where torsion, identified with the rank-2 Kalb-Ramond field, exists in the bulk together with gravity. While the interactions of both graviton and torsion in the bulk are controlled by the Planck mass, an additional exponential suppression comes for the torsion zero-mode on the visible brane. This may serve as a natural explanation of why the effect of torsion is so much weaker than that of curvature on the brane. The massive torsion modes, on the other hand, are correlated with the corresponding gravitonic modes and may be detectable in TeV-scale experiments.",

        "Abstract": "The Columbia University Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine IDEATel) project is a four-year demonstration project funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services with the overall goal of evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of telemedicine. The focal point of the intervention is the home telemedicine unit (HTU), which provides four functions: synchronous videoconferencing over standard telephone lines, electronic transmission for fingerstick glucose and blood pressure readings, secure Web-based messaging and clinical data review, and access to Web-based educational materials. The HTU must be usable by elderly patients with no prior computer experience. Providing these functions through the HTU requires tight integration of six components: the HTU itself, case management software, a clinical information system, Web-based educational material, data security, and networking and telecommunications. These six components were integrated through a variety of interfaces, providing a system that works well for patients and providers. With more than 400 HTUs installed, IDEATel has demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale home telemedicine.",
