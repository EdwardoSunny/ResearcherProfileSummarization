However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger neuroinflammation are poorly understood. Viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers innate immune responses when sensed by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) present in all cell types. Here, we report that human neurons intrinsically carry exceptionally high levels of immunostimulatory dsRNAs and identify long 3'UTRs as giving rise to neuronal dsRNA structures.

        "Abstract": "An important pathogenicity factor of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses is Non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1), which suppresses host gene expression and stunts antiviral signaling. SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binds the ribosome to inhibit translation through mRNA displacement and induces degradation of host mRNAs. Here we show that Nsp1-dependent host shutoff is conserved in diverse coronaviruses, but only Nsp1 from \u03b2-Coronaviruses (\u03b2-CoV) inhibits translation through ribosome binding. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of all \u03b2-CoV Nsp1s confers high-affinity ribosome binding despite low sequence conservation. Modeling of interactions of four Nsp1s with the ribosome identified the few absolutely conserved amino acids that, together with an overall conservation in surface charge, form the \u03b2-CoV Nsp1 ribosome-binding domain. Contrary to previous models, the Nsp1 ribosome-binding domain is an inefficient translation inhibitor. Instead, the Nsp1-CTD likely functions by recruiting Nsp1's N-terminal \"effector\" domain. Finally, we show that a cis-acting viral RNA element has co-evolved to fine-tune SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 function, but does not provide similar protection against Nsp1 from related viruses. Together, our work provides new insight into the diversity and conservation of ribosome-dependent host-shutoff functions of Nsp1, knowledge that could aid future efforts in pharmacological targeting of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 and related human-pathogenic \u03b2-CoVs. Our study also exemplifies how comparing highly divergent Nsp1 variants can help to dissect the different modalities of this multi-functional viral protein.",

        "Title": "Different tertiary interactions create the same important 3D features in a distinct flavivirus xrRNA.",
        "Abstract": "During infection by a flavivirus (FV), cells accumulate noncoding subgenomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) that interfere with several antiviral pathways. These sfRNAs are formed by structured RNA elements in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genomic RNA, which block the progression of host cell exoribonucleases that have targeted the viral RNA. Previous work on these exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs) from mosquito-borne FVs revealed a specific three-dimensional fold with a unique topology in which a ring-like structure protectively encircles the 5' end of the xrRNA. Conserved nucleotides make specific tertiary interactions that support this fold. Examination of more divergent FVs reveals differences in their 3' UTR sequences, raising the question of whether they contain xrRNAs and if so, how they fold. To answer this, we demonstrated the presence of an authentic xrRNA in the 3' UTR of the Tamana bat virus (TABV) and solved its structure by X-ray crystallography. The structure reveals conserved features from previously characterized xrRNAs, but in the TABV version these features are created through a novel set of tertiary interactions not previously seen in xrRNAs. This includes two important A-C interactions, four distinct backbone kinks, several ordered Mg",

        "Abstract": "Exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs) are discrete elements that block the progression of 5' to 3' exoribonucleases using specifically folded RNA structures. A recently discovered class of xrRNA is widespread in several genera of plant-infecting viruses, within both noncoding and protein-coding subgenomic RNAs. The structure of one such xrRNA from a dianthovirus revealed three-dimensional details of the resistant fold but did not answer all questions regarding the conservation and diversity of this xrRNA class. Here, we present the crystal structure of a representative polerovirus xrRNA that contains sequence elements that diverge from the previously solved structure. This new structure rationalizes previously unexplained sequence conservation patterns and shows interactions not present in the first structure. Together, the structures of these xrRNAs from dianthovirus and polerovirus genera support the idea that these plant virus xrRNAs fold through a defined pathway that includes a programmed intermediate conformation. This work deepens our knowledge of the structure-function relationship of xrRNAs and shows how evolution can craft similar RNA folds from divergent sequences.",

        "Abstract": "Productive splicing of human precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) requires the correct selection of\u00a0authentic splice sites (SS) from the large pool of potential SS. Although SS consensus sequence and splicing regulatory proteins are known to influence SS usage, the mechanisms ensuring the effective suppression of cryptic SS are insufficiently explored. Here, we find that many aberrant exonic SS are efficiently silenced by the exon junction complex (EJC), a multi-protein complex that is deposited on spliced mRNA near the exon-exon junction. Upon depletion of EJC proteins, cryptic SS are de-repressed, leading to the mis-splicing of a broad set of mRNAs. Mechanistically, the EJC-mediated recruitment of the splicing regulator RNPS1 inhibits cryptic 5'SS usage, while the deposition of the EJC core directly masks reconstituted 3'SS, thereby precluding transcript disintegration. Thus, the EJC protects the transcriptome of mammalian cells from inadvertent loss of exonic sequences and safeguards the expression of intact, full-length mRNAs.",

        "Abstract": "Folded RNA elements that block processive 5' \u2192 3' cellular exoribonucleases (xrRNAs) to produce biologically active viral noncoding RNAs have been discovered in flaviviruses, potentially revealing a new mode of RNA maturation. However, whether this RNA structure-dependent mechanism exists elsewhere and, if so, whether a singular RNA fold is required, have been unclear. Here we demonstrate the existence of authentic RNA structure-dependent xrRNAs in dianthoviruses, plant-infecting viruses unrelated to animal-infecting flaviviruses. These xrRNAs have no sequence similarity to known xrRNAs; thus, we used a combination of biochemistry and virology to characterize their sequence requirements and mechanism of stopping exoribonucleases. By solving the structure of a dianthovirus xrRNA by X-ray crystallography, we reveal a complex fold that is very different from that of the flavivirus xrRNAs. However, both versions of xrRNAs contain a unique topological feature, a pseudoknot that creates a protective ring around the 5' end of the RNA structure; this may be a defining structural feature of xrRNAs. Single-molecule FRET experiments reveal that the dianthovirus xrRNAs undergo conformational changes and can use \"codegradational remodeling,\" exploiting the exoribonucleases' degradation-linked helicase activity to help form their resistant structure; such a mechanism has not previously been reported. Convergent evolution has created RNA structure-dependent exoribonuclease resistance in different contexts, which establishes it as a general RNA maturation mechanism and defines xrRNAs as an authentic functional class of RNAs.",

        "Abstract": "The export of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is the final of several nuclear posttranscriptional steps of gene expression. The formation of export-competent mRNPs involves the recruitment of export factors that are assumed to facilitate transport of the mature mRNAs. Using in vitro splicing assays, we show that a core set of export factors, including ALYREF, UAP56 and DDX39, readily associate with the spliced RNAs in an EJC (exon junction complex)- and cap-dependent manner. In order to elucidate how ALYREF and other export adaptors mediate mRNA export, we conducted a computational analysis and discovered four short, conserved, linear motifs present in RNA-binding proteins. We show that mutation in one of the new motifs (WxHD) in an unstructured region of ALYREF reduced RNA binding and abolished the interaction with eIF4A3 and CBP80. Additionally, the mutation impaired proper localization to nuclear speckles and export of a spliced reporter mRNA. Our results reveal important details of the orchestrated recruitment of export factors during the formation of export competent mRNPs.",

        "Title": "CWC22-dependent pre-mRNA splicing and eIF4A3 binding enables global deposition of exon junction complexes.",
        "Abstract": "In metazoan cells, spliced mRNAs are marked by the exon junction complex (EJC), a multi-protein complex that serves as a key regulator of post-transcriptional mRNA metabolism. Deposition of EJCs on mRNA is intimately linked to the splicing process. The spliceosomal protein CWC22 directly binds the core EJC-protein eIF4A3, guides it to the spliceosome and initiates EJC assembly. In addition, CWC22 is involved in the splicing process itself, but the molecular details of its dual function remain elusive. Here we analyze the mechanisms, by which CWC22 co-regulates pre-mRNA splicing and EJC assembly. We show that the core of CWC22 is sufficient to mediate both pre-mRNA splicing and EJC assembly. Nonetheless, both processes can be functionally uncoupled with an eIF4A3-binding deficient mutant of CWC22, which impedes EJC assembly. A C-terminal domain of CWC22 strongly enhances its spliceosomal interaction and likely regulates its function. High-throughput RNA-sequencing identifies global defects of pre-mRNA splicing and downregulation of diverse gene expression pathways in CWC22-depleted cells. We propose a model, in which CWC22 represents an integral component of the spliceosome and orchestrates pre-mRNA splicing and eIF4A3 binding to achieve global assembly of exon junction complexes.",

        "Abstract": "NKAP is a highly conserved protein with roles in transcriptional repression, T-cell development, maturation and acquisition of functional competency and maintenance and survival of adult hematopoietic stem cells. Here we report the novel role of NKAP in splicing. With NKAP-specific antibodies we found that NKAP localizes to nuclear speckles. NKAP has an RS motif at the N-terminus followed by a highly basic domain and a DUF 926 domain at the C-terminal region. Deletion analysis showed that the basic domain is important for speckle localization. In pull-down experiments, we identified RNA-binding proteins, RNA helicases and splicing factors as interaction partners of NKAP, among them FUS/TLS. The FUS/TLS-NKAP interaction takes place through the RS domain of NKAP and the RGG1 and RGG3 domains of FUS/TLS. We analyzed the ability of NKAP to interact with RNA using in vitro splicing assays and found that NKAP bound both spliced messenger RNA (mRNA) and unspliced pre-mRNA. Genome-wide analysis using crosslinking and immunoprecipitation-seq revealed NKAP association with U1, U4 and U5 small nuclear RNA, and we also demonstrated that knockdown of NKAP led to an increase in pre-mRNA percentage. Our results reveal NKAP as nuclear speckle protein with roles in RNA splicing and processing.",

        "Abstract": "The correct processing and faithful decoding of mRNAs during gene expression depends on the interaction with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). The association of RBPs with pre-mRNAs starts during transcription by RNA polymerase II and undergoes constant remodeling during pre-mRNA processing and later steps of genes expression. Recently developed high throughput methods enabled to define RBP binding sites in vivo and to identify a large number of novel RBPs in eukaryotic cells. However, the detailed characterization of RBP-RNA interactions as well as the analysis of functional RNPs is greatly facilitated by well-defined in vitro systems. Here, we describe a versatile method to study the assembly and splicing-dependent remodeling of mRNPs in vitro. This method employs splicing-competent whole cell extracts (WCE) generated from transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. FLAG-tagged proteins present in the WCE are incorporated into mRNPs in vitro and afterwards used to immunoprecipitate substrate RNAs. We outline the principles of purifying in vitro assembled mRNPs and provide detailed protocols for the preparation and use of whole cell extracts. Alternative purification strategies and RNA substrates are discussed.",

Although the composition of EJCs is well understood, the mechanism mediating splicing-dependent EJC assembly and the factor(s) recruiting the EJC remain elusive. Here, we identify CWC22 as an essential splicing factor that is required for EJC assembly. In CWC22-depleted cells, pre-mRNA splicing is impaired but is rescued by a central fragment of CWC22. We show that the MIF4G domain of CWC22 initiates EJC assembly via a direct interaction with the EJC core protein eIF4A3, and we characterize mutations in eIF4A3 that abolish binding to CWC22. These eIF4A3 mutants efficiently nucleate splicing-independent recombinant EJC core complexes, but they fail to support splicing-dependent EJC deposition. Our work establishes a direct link between the splicing machinery and the EJC, hence uncovering a molecular interaction at the center of a posttranscriptional gene regulation network.",
