        "Abstract": "Linear and logistic regression are widely used statistical techniques in population genetics for analyzing genetic data and uncovering patterns and associations in large genetic datasets, such as identifying genetic variations linked to specific diseases or traits. However, obtaining statistically significant results from these studies requires large amounts of sensitive genotype and phenotype information from thousands of patients, which raises privacy concerns. Although cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption offers a potential solution to the privacy concerns as it allows computations on encrypted data, previous methods leveraging homomorphic encryption have not addressed the confidentiality of shared models, which can leak information about the training data.",

        "Title": "Omics Approaches to Investigate the Pathogenesis of Suicide.",
        "Abstract": "Suicide is the second leading cause of death in U.S. adolescents and young adults and is generally associated with a psychiatric disorder. Suicidal behavior has a complex etiology and pathogenesis. Moderate heritability suggests genetic causes. Associations between childhood and recent life adversity indicate contributions from epigenetic factors. Genomic contributions to suicide pathogenesis remain largely unknown. This article is based on a workshop held to design strategies to identify molecular drivers of suicide neurobiology that would be putative new treatment targets. The panel determined that while bulk tissue studies provide comprehensive information, single-nucleus approaches that identify cell type-specific changes are needed. While single-nuclei techniques lack information on cytoplasm, processes, spines, and synapses, spatial multiomic technologies on intact tissue detect cell alterations specific to brain tissue layers and subregions. Because suicide has genetic and environmental drivers, multiomic approaches that combine cell type-specific epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome provide a more complete picture of pathogenesis. To determine the direction of effect of suicide risk gene variants on RNA and protein expression and how these interact with epigenetic marks, single-nuclei and spatial multiomics quantitative trait loci maps should be integrated with whole-genome sequencing and genome-wide association databases. The workshop concluded with a recommendation for the formation of an international suicide biology consortium that will bring together brain banks and investigators with expertise in cutting-edge omics technologies to delineate the biology of suicide and identify novel potential treatment targets to be tested in cellular and animal models for drug and biomarker discovery to guide suicide prevention.",

        "Abstract": "The three-dimensional organization of genomes plays a crucial role in essential biological processes. The segregation of chromatin into A and B compartments highlights regions of activity and inactivity, providing a window into the genomic activities specific to each cell type. Yet, the steep costs associated with acquiring Hi-C data, necessary for studying this compartmentalization across various cell types, pose a significant barrier in studying cell type specific genome organization. To address this, we present a prediction tool called compartment prediction using recurrent neural networks (CoRNN), which predicts compartmentalization of 3D genome using histone modification enrichment. CoRNN demonstrates robust cross-cell-type prediction of A/B compartments with an average AuROC of 90.9%. Cell-type-specific predictions align well with known functional elements, with H3K27ac and H3K36me3 identified as highly predictive histone marks. We further investigate our mispredictions and found that they are located in regions with ambiguous compartmental status. Furthermore, our model's generalizability is validated by predicting compartments in independent tissue samples, which underscores its broad applicability.",

Machine learning models are shown to be useful for early detection, however training such models suffers from small sample sizes due to rarity of the condition. Here we propose a Federated Learning approach to train a DCI classifier across three institutions to overcome challenges of sharing data across hospitals. We developed a framework for federated feature selection and built a federated ensemble classifier. We compared the performance of FL model to that obtained by training separate models at each site. FL significantly improved performance at only two sites. We found that this was due to feature distribution differences across sites. FL improves performance in sites with similar feature distributions, however, FL can worsen performance in sites with heterogeneous distributions. The results highlight both the benefit of FL and the need to assess dataset distribution similarity before conducting FL.",

        "Abstract": "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from omics data create a reidentification risk for individuals and their relatives. Although the ability of thousands of SNPs (especially rare ones) to identify individuals has been repeatedly shown, the availability of small sets of noisy genotypes, from environmental DNA samples or functional genomics data, motivated us to quantify their informativeness. We present a computational tool suite, termed Privacy Leakage by Inference across Genotypic HMM Trajectories (PLIGHT), using population-genetics-based hidden Markov models (HMMs) of recombination and mutation to find piecewise alignment of small, noisy SNP sets to reference haplotype databases. We explore cases in which query individuals are either known to be in the database, or not, and consider several genotype queries, including those from environmental sample swabs from known individuals and from simulated \"mosaics\" (two-individual composites). Using PLIGHT on a database with \u223c5000 haplotypes, we find for common, noise-free SNPs that only ten are sufficient to identify individuals, \u223c20 can identify both components in two-individual mosaics, and 20-30 can identify first-order relatives. Using noisy environmental-sample-derived SNPs, PLIGHT identifies individuals in a database using \u223c30 SNPs. Even when the individuals are not in the database, local genotype matches allow for some phenotypic information leakage based on coarse-grained SNP imputation. Finally, by quantifying privacy leakage from sparse SNP sets, PLIGHT helps determine the value of selectively sanitizing released SNPs without explicit assumptions about population membership or allele frequency. To make this practical, we provide a sanitization tool to remove the most identifying SNPs from genomic data.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding how genetic variants impact molecular phenotypes is a key goal of functional genomics, currently hindered by reliance on a single haploid reference genome. Here, we present the EN-TEx resource of 1,635 open-access datasets from four donors (\u223c30 tissues \u00d7 \u223c15 assays). The datasets are mapped to matched, diploid genomes with long-read phasing and structural variants, instantiating a catalog of >1 million allele-specific loci. These loci exhibit coordinated activity along haplotypes and are less conserved than corresponding, non-allele-specific ones. Surprisingly, a deep-learning transformer model can predict the allele-specific activity based only on local nucleotide-sequence context, highlighting the importance of transcription-factor-binding motifs particularly sensitive to variants. Furthermore, combining EN-TEx with existing genome annotations reveals strong associations between allele-specific and GWAS loci. It also enables models for transferring known eQTLs to difficult-to-profile tissues (e.g., from skin to heart). Overall, EN-TEx provides rich data and generalizable models for more accurate personal functional genomics.",

        "Title": "Privacy-preserving cancer type prediction with homomorphic encryption.",
        "Abstract": "Cancer genomics tailors diagnosis and treatment based on an individual's genetic information and is the crux of precision medicine. However, analysis and maintenance of high volume of genetic mutation data to build a machine learning (ML) model to predict the cancer type is a computationally expensive task and is often outsourced to powerful cloud servers, raising critical privacy concerns for patients' data. Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data, thus, providing cryptographic guarantees to protect privacy. But restrictive overheads of encrypted computation deter its usage. In this work, we explore the challenges of privacy preserving cancer type prediction using a dataset consisting of more than 2 million genetic mutations from 2713 patients for several cancer types by building a highly accurate ML model and then implementing its privacy preserving version in HE. Our solution for cancer type inference encodes somatic mutations based on their impact on the cancer genomes into the feature space and then uses statistical tests for feature selection. We propose a fast matrix multiplication algorithm for HE-based model. Our final model achieves 0.98 micro-average area under curve improving accuracy from 70.08 to 83.61% , being 550 times faster than the standard matrix multiplication-based privacy-preserving models.

        "Abstract": "Innovations in human-centered biomedical informatics are often developed with the eventual goal of real-world translation. While biomedical research questions are usually answered in terms of how a method performs in a particular context, we argue that it is equally important to consider and formally evaluate the ethical implications of informatics solutions. Several new research paradigms have arisen as a result of the consideration of ethical issues, including but not limited for privacy-preserving computation and fair machine learning. In the spirit of the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, we discuss broad and fundamental principles of ethical biomedical informatics in terms of Olelo Noeau, or Hawaiian proverbs and poetical sayings that capture Hawaiian values. While we emphasize issues related to privacy and fairness in particular, there are a multitude of facets to ethical biomedical informatics that can benefit from a critical analysis grounded in ethics.",

        "Abstract": "Machine learning is playing an increasingly critical role in health science with its capability of inferring valuable information from high-dimensional data. More training data provides greater statistical power to generate better models that can help decision-making in healthcare. However, this often requires combining research and patient data across institutions and hospitals, which is not always possible due to privacy considerations. In this paper, we outline a simple federated learning algorithm implementing differential privacy to ensure privacy when training a machine learning model on data spread across different institutions. We tested our model by predicting breast cancer status from gene expression data. Our model achieves a similar level of accuracy and precision as a single-site non-private neural network model when we enforce privacy. This result suggests that our algorithm is an effective method of implementing differential privacy with federated learning, and clinical data scientists can use our general framework to produce differentially private models on federated datasets. Our framework is available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/idash20FL.",

        "Abstract": "There are major efforts underway to make genome sequencing a routine part of clinical practice. A critical barrier to these is achieving practical solutions for data ownership and integrity. Blockchain provides solutions to these challenges in other realms, such as finance. However, its use in genomics is stymied due to the difficulty in storing large-scale data on-chain, slow transaction speeds, and limitations on querying. To overcome these roadblocks, we developed a private blockchain network to store genomic variants and reference-aligned reads on-chain. It uses nested database indexing with an accompanying tool suite to rapidly access and analyze the data.",

        "Abstract": "Genomics data are important for advancing biomedical research, improving clinical care, and informing other disciplines such as forensics and genealogy. However, privacy concerns arise when genomic data are shared. In particular, the identifying nature of genetic information, its direct relationship to health status, and the potential financial harm and stigmatization posed to individuals and their blood relatives call for a survey of the privacy issues related to sharing genetic and related data and potential solutions to overcome these issues. In this work, we provide an overview of the importance of genomic privacy, the information gleaned from genomics data, the sources of potential private information leakages in genomics, and ways to preserve privacy while utilizing the genetic information in research. We discuss the relationship between trust in the scientific community and protecting privacy, illuminating a future roadmap for data sharing and study participation.",

Broad sharing of these data is essential for research advancement but poses notable privacy challenges, some of which are analogous to those that occur when sharing genetic variant data. However, there are also unique privacy challenges that arise from cryptic information leakage during the processing and summarization of functional genomics data from raw reads to derived quantities, such as gene expression values. Here, we review these challenges and present potential solutions for mitigating privacy risks while allowing broad data dissemination and analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Genotype imputation is the inference of unknown genotypes using known population structure observed in large genomic datasets; it can further our understanding of phenotype-genotype relationships and is useful for QTL mapping and GWASs. However, the compute-intensive nature of genotype imputation can overwhelm local servers for computation and storage. Hence, many researchers are moving toward using cloud services, raising privacy concerns. We address these concerns by developing an efficient, privacy-preserving algorithm called p-Impute. Our method uses homomorphic encryption, allowing calculations on ciphertext, thereby avoiding the decryption of private genotypes in the cloud. It is similar to k-nearest neighbor approaches, inferring missing genotypes in a genomic block based on the SNP genotypes of genetically related individuals in the same block. Our results demonstrate accuracy in agreement with the state-of-the-art plaintext solutions. Moreover, p-Impute is scalable to real-world applications as its memory and time requirements increase linearly with the increasing number of samples. p-Impute is freely available for download here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5542001.",

        "Abstract": "The recent advances in genome sequencing technologies provide unprecedented opportunities to understand the relationship between human genetic variation and diseases. However, genotyping whole genomes from a large cohort of individuals is still cost prohibitive. Imputation methods to predict genotypes of missing genetic variants are widely used, especially for genome-wide association studies. Accurate genotype imputation requires complex statistical methods. Due to the data and computing-intensive nature of the problem, imputation is increasingly outsourced, raising serious privacy concerns. In this work, we investigate solutions for fast, scalable, and accurate privacy-preserving genotype imputation using Machine Learning (ML) and a standardized homomorphic encryption scheme, Paillier cryptosystem. ML-based privacy-preserving inference has been largely optimized for computation-heavy non-linear functions in a single-output multi-class classification setting. However, having a large number of multi-class outputs per genome per individual calls for further optimizations and/or approximations specific to this application. Here we explore the effectiveness of linear models for genotype imputation to convert them to privacy-preserving equivalents using standardized homomorphic encryption schemes. Our results show that performance of our privacy-preserving genotype imputation method is equivalent to the state-of-the-art plaintext solutions, achieving up to 99% micro area under curve score, even on real-world large-scale datasets up to 80,000 targets.",

        "Title": "Establishing a Global Standard for Wearable Devices in Sport and Exercise Medicine: Perspectives from Academic and Industry Stakeholders.",
        "Abstract": "Millions of consumer sport and fitness wearables (CSFWs) are used worldwide, and millions of datapoints are generated by each device. Moreover, these numbers are rapidly growing, and they contain a heterogeneity of devices, data types, and contexts for data collection. Companies and consumers would benefit from guiding standards on device quality and data formats. To address this growing need, we convened a virtual panel of industry and academic stakeholders, and this manuscript summarizes the outcomes of the discussion. Our objectives were to identify (1) key facilitators of and barriers to participation by CSFW manufacturers in guiding standards and (2) stakeholder priorities. The venues were the Yale Center for Biomedical Data Science Digital Health Monthly Seminar Series (62 participants) and the New England Chapter of the American College of Sports Medicine Annual Meeting (59 participants). In the discussion, stakeholders outlined both facilitators of (e.g., commercial return on investment in device quality, lucrative research partnerships, and transparent and multilevel evaluation of device quality) and barriers (e.g., competitive advantage conflict, lack of flexibility in previously developed devices) to participation in guiding standards. There was general agreement to adopt Keadle et al.'s standard pathway for testing devices (i.e., benchtop, laboratory, field-based, implementation) without consensus on the prioritization of these steps. Overall, there was enthusiasm not to add prescriptive or regulatory steps, but instead create a networking hub that connects companies to consumers and researchers for flexible guidance navigating the heterogeneity, multi-tiered development, dynamicity, and nebulousness of the CSFW field.",

        "Abstract": "Cellular heterogeneity in the human brain obscures the identification of robust cellular regulatory networks, which is necessary to understand the function of non-coding elements and the impact of non-coding genetic variation. Here we integrate genome-wide chromosome conformation data from purified neurons and glia with transcriptomic and enhancer profiles, to characterize the gene regulatory landscape of two major cell classes in the human brain. We then leverage cell-type-specific regulatory landscapes to gain insight into the cellular etiology of several brain disorders. We find that Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated epigenetic dysregulation is linked to neurons and oligodendrocytes, whereas genetic risk factors for AD highlighted microglia, suggesting that different cell types may contribute to disease risk, via different mechanisms. Moreover, integration of glutamatergic and GABAergic regulatory maps with genetic risk factors for schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) identifies shared (parvalbumin-expressing interneurons) and distinct cellular etiologies (upper layer neurons for BD, and deeper layer projection neurons for SCZ). Collectively, these findings shed new light on cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks in brain disorders.",

Echinocandins were the most common administered agents, followed by fluconazole. Overall mortality was 44%. Echinocandins and voriconazole showed sufficient activity against all tested isolates. High fluconazole MICs among C.guilliermondii, C.pelliculosa, and C.rugosa were determined. MIC value of C.pelliculosa was above the epidemiological cut-off proposed for fluconazole.",

        "Abstract": "The generation of functional genomics datasets is surging, because they provide insight into gene regulation and organismal phenotypes (e.g., genes upregulated in cancer). The intent behind functional genomics experiments is not necessarily to study genetic variants, yet they pose privacy concerns due to their use of next-generation sequencing. Moreover, there is a great incentive to broadly share raw reads for better statistical power and general research reproducibility. Thus, we need new modes of sharing beyond traditional controlled-access models. Here, we develop a data-sanitization procedure allowing raw functional genomics reads to be shared while minimizing privacy leakage, enabling principled privacy-utility trade-offs. Our protocol works with traditional Illumina-based assays and newer technologies such as 10x single-cell RNA sequencing. It involves quantifying the privacy leakage in reads by statistically linking study participants to known individuals. We carried out these linkages using data from highly accurate reference genomes and more realistic environmental samples.",

        "Abstract": "ENCODE comprises thousands of functional genomics datasets, and the encyclopedia covers hundreds of cell types, providing a universal annotation for genome interpretation. However, for particular applications, it may be advantageous to use a customized annotation. Here, we develop such a custom annotation by leveraging advanced assays, such as eCLIP, Hi-C, and whole-genome STARR-seq on a number of data-rich ENCODE cell types. A key aspect of this annotation is comprehensive and experimentally derived networks of both transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins (TFs and RBPs). Cancer, a disease of system-wide dysregulation, is an ideal application for such a network-based annotation. Specifically, for cancer-associated cell types, we put regulators into hierarchies and measure their network change (rewiring) during oncogenesis. We also extensively survey TF-RBP crosstalk, highlighting how SUB1, a previously uncharacterized RBP, drives aberrant tumor expression and amplifies the effect of MYC, a well-known oncogenic TF. Furthermore, we show how our annotation allows us to place oncogenic transformations in the context of a broad cell space; here, many normal-to-tumor transitions move towards a stem-like state, while oncogene knockdowns show an opposing trend. Finally, we organize the resource into a coherent workflow to prioritize key elements and variants, in addition to regulators. We showcase the application of this prioritization to somatic burdening, cancer differential expression and GWAS. Targeted validations of the prioritized regulators, elements and variants using siRNA knockdowns, CRISPR-based editing, and luciferase assays demonstrate the value of the ENCODE resource.",

However, quantifying privacy leakage via genotyping is difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of sequencing techniques. Thus, we present FANCY, a tool that rapidly estimates the number of leaking variants from raw RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq and ChIP-Seq reads, without explicit genotyping. FANCY employs supervised regression using overall sequencing statistics as features and provides an estimate of the overall privacy risk before data release.",

        "Abstract": "Genomic variants are considered sensitive information, revealing potentially private facts about individuals. Therefore, it is important to control access to such data. A key aspect of controlled access is secure storage and efficient query of access logs, for potential misuse. However, there are challenges to securing logs, such as designing against the consequences of \"single points of failure\". A potential approach to circumvent these challenges is blockchain technology, which is currently popular in cryptocurrency due to its properties of security, immutability, and decentralization. One of the tasks of the iDASH (Integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and Sharing) Secure Genome Analysis Competition in 2018 was to develop time- and space-efficient blockchain-based ledgering solutions to log and query user activity accessing genomic datasets across multiple sites, using MultiChain.",

One promising option for secure, high-integrity storage and sharing is Ethereum smart contracts. Ethereum is a blockchain platform, and smart contracts are immutable pieces of code running on virtual machines in this platform that can be invoked by a user or another contract (in the blockchain network). The 2019 iDASH (Integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and Sharing) competition for Secure Genome Analysis challenged participants to develop time- and space-efficient Ethereum smart contracts for gene-drug relationship data.",

        "Abstract": "With decreasing cost of biomedical technologies, the scale of the genetic and healthcare data have exponentially increased and become available to wider audiences. Hence, privacy of patients and study participants has garnered the attention of researchers and regulators alike. Availability of genetic and health care information for uses not anticipated at the time of collection gives rise to privacy concerns such that people suffer dignitary harm when their data is used in ways they did not desire or intend, even if no concrete economic damage results. In this workshop, we explore the issues surrounding data use to advance human health from a privacy perspective. Broadly this field can be considered in two encompassing areas: (1) Ethics and regulation of privacy: The ethical and regulatory frames through which we can consider privacy, the existing regulations regarding privacy and what is on the horizon, and implementation of such ethical considerations for data with the new Common Rule. (2) Approaches to ensuring privacy using technology: The technologies that allow responsible use and sharing of data such as encryption and the quantification of privacy leakages in publicly available data through privacy attacks for better risk-assessment tools.",

        "Abstract": "Despite progress in defining genetic risk for psychiatric disorders, their molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Addressing this, the PsychENCODE Consortium has generated a comprehensive online resource for the adult brain across 1866 individuals. The PsychENCODE resource contains ~79,000 brain-active enhancers, sets of Hi-C linkages, and topologically associating domains; single-cell expression profiles for many cell types; expression quantitative-trait loci (QTLs); and further QTLs associated with chromatin, splicing, and cell-type proportions. Integration shows that varying cell-type proportions largely account for the cross-population variation in expression (with >88% reconstruction accuracy). It also allows building of a gene regulatory network, linking genome-wide association study variants to genes (e.g., 321 for schizophrenia). We embed this network into an interpretable deep-learning model, which improves disease prediction by ~6-fold versus polygenic risk scores and identifies key genes and pathways in psychiatric disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Most genetic risk for psychiatric disease lies in regulatory regions, implicating pathogenic dysregulation of gene expression and splicing. However, comprehensive assessments of transcriptomic organization in diseased brains are limited. In this work, we integrated genotypes and RNA sequencing in brain samples from 1695 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, as well as controls. More than 25% of the transcriptome exhibits differential splicing or expression, with isoform-level changes capturing the largest disease effects and genetic enrichments. Coexpression networks isolate disease-specific neuronal alterations, as well as microglial, astrocyte, and interferon-response modules defining previously unidentified neural-immune mechanisms. We integrated genetic and genomic data to perform a transcriptome-wide association study, prioritizing disease loci likely mediated by cis effects on brain expression. This transcriptome-wide characterization of the molecular pathology across three major psychiatric disorders provides a comprehensive resource for mechanistic insight and therapeutic development.",

Integrative analysis revealed temporal, regional, sex, and cell type-specific dynamics.

Analysis of gene coexpression modules revealed relationships with epigenomic regulation and neurodevelopmental processes.

        "Abstract": "Genes implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders are active in human fetal brain, yet difficult to study in a longitudinal fashion. We demonstrate that organoids from human pluripotent cells model cerebral cortical development on the molecular level before 16 weeks postconception. A multiomics analysis revealed differentially active genes and enhancers, with the greatest changes occurring at the transition from stem cells to progenitors. Networks of converging gene and enhancer modules were assembled into six and four global patterns of expression and activity across time. A pattern with progressive down-regulation was enriched with human-gained enhancers, suggesting their importance in early human brain development. A few convergent gene and enhancer modules were enriched in autism-associated genes and genomic variants in autistic children. The organoid model helps identify functional elements that may drive disease onset.",

        "Abstract": "Conformation capture technologies measure frequencies of interactions between chromatin regions. However, understanding gene-regulation require knowledge of detailed spatial structures of heterogeneous chromatin in cells. Here we describe the nC-SAC (n-Constrained-Self Avoiding Chromatin) method that transforms experimental interaction frequencies into 3D ensembles of chromatin chains. nC-SAC first distinguishes specific from non-specific interaction frequencies, then generates 3D chromatin ensembles using identified specific interactions as spatial constraints. Application to \u03b1-globin locus shows that these constraints (\u223c20%) drive the formation of \u223c99% all experimentally captured interactions, in which \u223c30% additional to the imposed constraints is found to be specific. Many novel specific spatial contacts not captured by experiments are also predicted. A subset, of which independent ChIA-PET data are available, is validated to be RNAPII-, CTCF-, and RAD21-mediated. Their positioning in the architectural context of imposed specific interactions from nC-SAC is highly important. Our results also suggest the presence of a many-body structural unit involving \u03b1-globin gene, its enhancers, and POL3RK gene for regulating the expression of \u03b1-globin in silent cells.",

        "Abstract": "Nuclear landmarks and biochemical factors play important roles in the organization of the yeast genome. The interaction pattern of budding yeast as measured from genome-wide 3C studies are largely recapitulated by model polymer genomes subject to landmark constraints. However, the origin of inter-chromosomal interactions, specific roles of individual landmarks, and the roles of biochemical factors in yeast genome organization remain unclear. Here we describe a multi-chromosome constrained self-avoiding chromatin model (mC-SAC) to gain understanding of the budding yeast genome organization. With significantly improved sampling of genome structures, both intra- and inter-chromosomal interaction patterns from genome-wide 3C studies are accurately captured in our model at higher resolution than previous studies. We show that nuclear confinement is a key determinant of the intra-chromosomal interactions, and centromere tethering is responsible for the inter-chromosomal interactions. In addition, important genomic elements such as fragile sites and tRNA genes are found to be clustered spatially, largely due to centromere tethering. We uncovered previously unknown interactions that were not captured by genome-wide 3C studies, which are found to be enriched with tRNA genes, RNAPIII and TFIIS binding. Moreover, we identified specific high-frequency genome-wide 3C interactions that are unaccounted for by polymer effects under landmark constraints. These interactions are enriched with important genes and likely play biological roles.",

        "Abstract": "Stochasticity plays important roles in regulation of biochemical reaction networks when the copy numbers of molecular species are small. Studies based on Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) has shown that a basic reaction system can display stochastic focusing (SF) by increasing the sensitivity of the network as a result of the signal noise. Although SSA has been widely used to study stochastic networks, it is ineffective in examining rare events and this becomes a significant issue when the tails of probability distributions are relevant as is the case of SF. Here we use the ACME method to solve the exact solution of the discrete Chemical Master Equations and to study a network where SF was reported. We showed that the level of SF depends on the degree of the fluctuations of signal molecule. We discovered that signaling noise under certain conditions in the same reaction network can lead to a decrease in the system sensitivities, thus the network can experience stochastic defocusing. These results highlight the fundamental role of stochasticity in biological reaction networks and the need for exact computation of probability landscape of the molecules in the system.",

        "Abstract": "Ventilator-induced inflammatory lung injury (VILI) is mechanistically linked to increased NAMPT transcription and circulating levels of nicotinamide phosphoribosyl-transferase (NAMPT/PBEF). Although VILI severity is attenuated by reduced NAMPT/PBEF bioavailability, the precise contribution of NAMPT/PBEF and excessive mechanical stress to VILI pathobiology is unknown. We now report that NAMPT/PBEF induces lung NF\u03baB transcriptional activities and inflammatory injury via direct ligation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Computational analysis demonstrated that NAMPT/PBEF and MD-2, a TLR4-binding protein essential for LPS-induced TLR4 activation, share ~30% sequence identity and exhibit striking structural similarity in loop regions critical for MD-2-TLR4 binding. Unlike MD-2, whose TLR4 binding alone is insufficient to initiate TLR4 signaling, NAMPT/PBEF alone produces robust TLR4 activation, likely via a protruding region of NAMPT/PBEF (S402-N412) with structural similarity to LPS. The identification of this unique mode of TLR4 activation by NAMPT/PBEF advances the understanding of innate immunity responses as well as the untoward events associated with mechanical stress-induced lung inflammation.",

Single-cell imaging techniques provide a wealth of information on the spatial organization of chromosomes. Computational tools for modelling chromosome structure have broad implications in studying the effect of cell nucleus on higher-order genome organization. Here we describe a multichromosome constrained self-avoiding chromatin model for studying ensembles of genome structural models of budding yeast nucleus. We successfully generated a large number of model genomes of yeast with appropriate chromatin fiber diameter, persistence length, and excluded volume under spatial confinement. By incorporating details of the constraints from single-cell imaging studies, our method can model the budding yeast genome realistically. The model developed here provides a general computational framework for studying the overall architecture of budding yeast genome.",

        "Abstract": "Genome sequences provide the overall genetic blueprint of cells, but cells possessing the same genome can exhibit diverse phenotypes. There is a multitude of mechanisms controlling cellular epigenetic states and that dictate the behavior of cells. Among these, networks of interacting molecules, often under stochastic control, depending on the specific wirings of molecular components and the physiological conditions, can have a different landscape of cellular states. In addition, chromosome folding in three-dimensional space provides another important control mechanism for selective activation and repression of gene expression. Fully differentiated cells with different properties grow, divide, and interact through mechanical forces and communicate through signal transduction, resulting in the formation of complex tissue patterns. Developing quantitative models to study these multi-scale phenomena and to identify opportunities for improving human health requires development of theoretical models, algorithms, and computational tools. Here we review recent progress made in these important directions.",

Single-cell imaging and chromosome conformation capture-based techniques provide a wealth of information on the spatial organization of chromosomes. However, a mechanistic model that can account for all observed scaling behaviors governing long-range chromatin interactions is missing. Here we describe a model called constrained self-avoiding chromatin (C-SAC) for studying spatial structures of chromosomes, as the available space is a key determinant of chromosome folding. We studied large ensembles of model chromatin chains with appropriate fiber diameter, persistence length and excluded volume under spatial confinement. We show that the equilibrium ensemble of randomly folded chromosomes in the confined nuclear volume gives rise to the experimentally observed higher-order architecture of human chromosomes, including average scaling properties of mean-square spatial distance, end-to-end distance, contact probability and their chromosome-to-chromosome variabilities. Our results indicate that the overall structure of a human chromosome is dictated by the spatial confinement of the nuclear space, which may undergo significant tissue- and developmental stage-specific size changes.",

        "Abstract": "It is well known that biological and social interaction networks have a varying degree of redundancy, though a consensus of the precise cause of this is so far lacking. In this paper, we introduce a topological redundancy measure for labeled directed networks that is formal, computationally efficient, and applicable to a variety of directed networks such as cellular signaling, and metabolic and social interaction networks. We demonstrate the computational efficiency of our measure by computing its value and statistical significance on a number of biological and social networks with up to several thousands of nodes and edges. Our results suggest a number of interesting observations: (1) Social networks are more redundant that their biological counterparts, (2) transcriptional networks are less redundant than signaling networks, (3) the topological redundancy of the C. elegans metabolic network is largely due to its inclusion of currency metabolites, and (4) the redundancy of signaling networks is highly (negatively) correlated with the monotonicity of their dynamics.",

        "Abstract": "Efficient communication between the cell and its external environment is of the utmost importance to the function of multicellular organisms. While signaling events can be generally characterized as information exchange by means of controlled energy conversion, research efforts have hitherto mainly been concerned with mechanisms involving chemical and electrical energy transfer. Here, we review recent computational efforts addressing the function of mechanical force in signal transduction. Specifically, we focus on the role of steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations in providing details at the atomic level on a group of protein domains, which play a fundamental role in signal exchange by responding properly to mechanical strain. We start by giving a brief introduction to the SMD technique and general properties of mechanically stable protein folds, followed by specific examples illustrating three general regimes of signal transfer utilizing mechanical energy: purely mechanical, mechanical to chemical, and chemical to mechanical. Whenever possible the physiological importance of the example at hand is stressed to highlight the diversity of the processes in which mechanical signaling plays a key role. We also provide an overview of future challenges and perspectives for this rapidly developing field.",
