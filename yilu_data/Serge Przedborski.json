        "Title": "The Role of Alpha-Synuclein in Synucleinopathy: Impact on Lipid Regulation at Mitochondria-ER Membranes.",
        "Abstract": "The protein alpha-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathy, which includes Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, and mounting evidence suggests that lipid dyshomeostasis is a critical phenotype in these neurodegenerative conditions. Previously, we identified that \u03b1Syn localizes to mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs), temporary functional domains containing proteins that regulate lipid metabolism, including the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylserine. In the present study, we have analyzed the lipid composition of postmortem human samples, focusing on the substantia nigra pars compacta of Parkinson's disease and controls, as well as three less affected brain regions of Parkinson's donors. To further assess synucleinopathy-related lipidome alterations, similar analyses were performed on the striatum of multiple system atrophy cases. Our data show region-and disease-specific changes in the levels of lipid species. Specifically, our data revealed alterations in the levels of specific phosphatidylserine species in brain areas most affected in Parkinson's disease. Some of these alterations, albeit to a lesser degree, are also observed multiples system atrophy. Using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, we show that \u03b1Syn contributes to regulating phosphatidylserine metabolism at MAM domains, and that \u03b1Syn dosage parallels the perturbation in phosphatidylserine levels. Our results support the notion that \u03b1Syn pathophysiology is linked to the dysregulation of lipid homeostasis, which may contribute to the vulnerability of specific brain regions in synucleinopathy. These findings have significant therapeutic implications.",

        "Abstract": "Protein prenylation is one example of a broad class of post-translational modifications where proteins are covalently linked to various hydrophobic moieties. To globally identify and monitor levels of all prenylated proteins in a cell simultaneously, our laboratory and others have developed chemical proteomic approaches that rely on the metabolic incorporation of isoprenoid analogues bearing bio-orthogonal functionality followed by enrichment and subsequent quantitative proteomic analysis. Here, several improvements in the synthesis of the alkyne-containing isoprenoid analogue C15AlkOPP are reported to improve synthetic efficiency. Next, metabolic labeling with C15AlkOPP was optimized to obtain useful levels of metabolic incorporation of the probe in several types of primary cells. Those conditions were then used to study the prenylomes of motor neurons (ES-MNs), astrocytes (ES-As), and their embryonic stem cell progenitors (ESCs), which allowed for the identification of 54 prenylated proteins from ESCs, 50 from ES-MNs, and 84 from ES-As, representing all types of prenylation. Bioinformatic analysis revealed specific enriched pathways, including nervous system development, chemokine signaling, Rho GTPase signaling, and adhesion. Hierarchical clustering showed that most enriched pathways in all three cell types are related to GTPase activity and vesicular transport. In contrast, STRING analysis showed significant interactions in two populations that appear to be cell type dependent. The data provided herein demonstrates that robust incorporation of C15AlkOPP can be obtained in ES-MNs and related primary cells purified via magnetic-activated cell sorting allowing the identification and quantification of numerous prenylated proteins. These results suggest that metabolic labeling with C15AlkOPP should be an effective approach for investigating the role of prenylated proteins in primary cells in both normal cells and disease pathologies, including ALS.",

The data provided herein demonstrates that robust incorporation of C15AlkOPP can be obtained in ES-MNs and related primary cells purified via magnetic-activated cell sorting allowing the identification and quantification of numerous prenylated proteins. These results suggest that metabolic labeling with C15AlkOPP should be an effective approach for investigating the role of prenylated proteins in primary cells in both normal cells and disease pathologies, including ALS.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to use blood to predict the outcomes of Parkinson's disease, including disease progression and cognitive and motor complications, would be of significant clinical value. We undertook bulk RNA sequencing from the caudate and putamen of postmortem Parkinson's disease (n\u2009=\u200935) and control (n\u2009=\u200940) striatum, and compared molecular profiles with clinical features and bulk RNA sequencing data obtained from antemortem peripheral blood. Cognitive and motor complications of Parkinson's disease were associated with molecular changes in the caudate (stress response) and putamen (endothelial pathways) respectively. Later and earlier-onset Parkinson's disease were molecularly distinct, and disease duration was associated with changes in caudate (oligodendrocyte development) and putamen (cellular senescence), respectively. Transcriptome patterns in the postmortem Parkinson's disease brain were also evident in antemortem peripheral blood, and correlated with clinical features of the disease. Together, these findings identify molecular signatures in Parkinson's disease patients' brain and blood of potential pathophysiologic and prognostic importance.",

        "Abstract": "Lipid profiles in biological fluids from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are increasingly investigated in search of biomarkers. However, the lipid profiles in genetic PD remain to be determined, a gap of knowledge of particular interest in PD associated with mutant \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA), given the known relationship between this protein and lipids. The objective of this research is to identify serum lipid composition from SNCA A53T mutation carriers and to compare these alterations to those found in cells and transgenic mice carrying the same genetic mutation. We conducted an unbiased lipidomic analysis of 530 lipid species from 34 lipid classes in serum of 30 participants with SNCA mutation with and without PD and 30 healthy controls. The primary analysis was done between 22 PD patients with SNCA+ (SNCA+/PD+) and 30 controls using machine-learning algorithms and traditional statistics. We also analyzed the lipid composition of human clonal-cell lines and tissue from transgenic mice overexpressing the same SNCA mutation. We identified specific lipid classes that best discriminate between SNCA+/PD+ patients and healthy controls and found certain lipid species, mainly from the glycerophosphatidylcholine and triradylglycerol classes, that are most contributory to this discrimination. Most of these alterations were also present in human derived cells and transgenic mice carrying the same mutation. Our combination of lipidomic and machine learning analyses revealed alterations in glycerophosphatidylcholine and triradylglycerol in sera from PD patients as well as cells and tissues expressing mutant \u03b1-Syn. Further investigations are needed to establish the pathogenic significance of these \u03b1-Syn-associated lipid changes.",

        "Title": "Sumoylation regulates the assembly and activity of the SMN complex.",
        "Abstract": "SMN is a ubiquitously expressed protein and is essential for life. SMN deficiency causes the neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMN interacts with itself and other proteins to form a complex that functions in the assembly of ribonucleoproteins. SMN is modified by SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier), but whether sumoylation is required for the functions of SMN that are relevant to SMA pathogenesis is not known. Here, we show that inactivation of a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) alters SMN sub-cellular distribution, the integrity of its complex, and its function in small nuclear ribonucleoproteins biogenesis. Expression of a SIM-inactivated mutant of SMN in a mouse model of SMA slightly extends survival rate with limited and transient correction of motor deficits. Remarkably, although SIM-inactivated SMN attenuates motor neuron loss and improves neuromuscular junction synapses, it fails to prevent the loss of sensory-motor synapses. These findings suggest that sumoylation is important for proper assembly and function of the SMN complex and that loss of this post-translational modification impairs the ability of SMN to correct selective deficits in the sensory-motor circuit of SMA mice.",

        "Abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult-onset paralytic disorder, characterized mainly by a loss of motor neurons (MNs) in the CNS. Over the past decades, thanks to intense investigations performed in both in vivo and in vitro models of ALS, major progress has been made toward gaining insights into the pathobiology of this incurable, fatal disorder. Among these advances is the growing recognition that non-neuronal cells participate in the degeneration of MNs in ALS, which could transform our understanding of the neurobiology of disease and the ability to devise effective disease-modifying therapies. In this review, we examine the contribution of non-cell-autonomous processes to the pathogenesis of ALS, with a focus on glial cells and in particular on astrocytes.",

        "Abstract": "The last decade has seen exciting advances in the development of potential stem cell-based therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD), which have used different types of stem cells as starting material. These cells have been developed primarily to replace dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra that are progressively lost in the disease process. The aim is to largely restore lost motor functions, whilst not ever being curative. We discuss cell-based strategies that will have to fulfill important criteria to become effective and competitive therapies for PD. These criteria include reproducibly producing sufficient numbers of cells with an authentic substantia nigra dopamine neuron A9 phenotype, which can integrate into the host brain after transplantation and form synapses (considered crucial for long-term functional benefits). Furthermore, it is essential that transplanted cells exhibit no, or only very low levels of, proliferation without tumor formation at the site of grafting. Cumulative research has shown that stem cell-based approaches continue to have great potential in PD, but key questions remain to be answered. Here, we review the most recent progress in research on stem cell-based dopamine neuron replacement therapy for PD and briefly discuss what the immediate future might hold. \u00a9 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

        "Abstract": "Many patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection develop neurological signs and symptoms; although, to date, little evidence exists that primary infection of the brain is a significant contributing factor. We present the clinical, neuropathological and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical centre. The mean age was 74\u2009years (38-97\u2009years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Hospital-associated complications were common, including eight patients (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, seven (17%) with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24\u2009h of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4\u2009weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischaemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared haemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, although none showed evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen patients (44%) exhibited pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, which was not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. The PCR analysis revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in the nasal epithelia. RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in coronavirus disease 2019 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but more likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischaemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive coronavirus disease 2019, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.",

        "Abstract": "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the international community, very little is known about its impact on the health and day-to-day activities of people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). To better understand the emotional and behavioral consequences of the public health policies implemented to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in PwPD, and to explore the factors contributing to accessing alternative health care mechanisms, such as telehealth, we administered an anonymous knowledge, attitude, and practice survey to PwPD and care partners, via the mailing lists of the Parkinson's Foundation and Columbia University Parkinson's Disease Center of Excellence with an average response rate of 19.3%. Sufficient information was provided by 1,342 PwPD to be included in the final analysis. Approximately half of respondents reported a negative change in PD symptoms, with 45-66% reporting mood disturbances. Telehealth use increased from 9.7% prior to the pandemic to 63.5% during the pandemic. Higher income and higher education were associated with telehealth use. Services were more often used for doctor's appointment than physical, occupational, speech, or mental health therapies. Almost half (46%) of PwPD preferred to continue using telehealth always or sometimes after the coronavirus outbreak had ended. Having received support/instruction for telehealth and having a care partner, friend, or family member to help them with the telehealth visit increased the likelihood of continuous use of telehealth after the pandemic ended. Taken together, PD symptoms and management practices were markedly affected by COVID-19. Given the observed demographic limitations of telehealth, expanding its implementation to include additional physical, occupational, psychological, and speech therapies, increasing support for telehealth, as well as reaching underserved (low income) populations is urgently required.",

        "Abstract": "Cell-to-cell communications are critical determinants of pathophysiological phenotypes, but methodologies for their systematic elucidation are lacking. Herein, we propose an approach for the Systematic Elucidation and Assessment of Regulatory Cell-to-cell Interaction Networks (SEARCHIN) to identify\u00a0ligand-mediated interactions between distinct cellular compartments. To test this approach, we selected a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in which astrocytes expressing mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (mutSOD1) kill wild-type motor neurons (MNs) by an unknown mechanism. Our\u00a0integrative analysis that combines proteomics and regulatory network analysis infers the interaction between astrocyte-released amyloid precursor protein (APP) and death receptor-6 (DR6) on MNs as the top predicted ligand-receptor pair. The inferred deleterious role of APP and DR6 is confirmed in vitro in models of ALS. Moreover, the DR6 knockdown in MNs of transgenic mutSOD1 mice attenuates the ALS-like phenotype. Our results support the usefulness of integrative, systems biology approach to gain insights into complex neurobiological disease processes as in ALS and posit that the proposed methodology is not restricted to this biological context and could be used in a variety of other non-cell-autonomous communication mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Focused ultrasound-enhanced intranasal (IN\u2009+\u2009FUS) delivery is a noninvasive approach that utilizes the olfactory pathway to administer pharmacological agents directly to the brain, allowing for a more homogenous distribution in targeted locations compared to IN delivery alone. However, whether such a strategy has therapeutic values, especially in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), remains to be established. Herein, we evaluated whether the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine catalysis, could be enhanced by IN\u2009+\u2009FUS delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in a toxin-based PD mouse model. Mice were put on the subacute dosing regimen of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), producing bilateral degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway consistent with early-stage PD. MPTP mice then received BDNF intranasally followed by multiple unilateral FUS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) openings in the left basal ganglia for three consecutive weeks. Subsequently, mice were survived for two months and were evaluated morphologically and behaviorally to determine the integrity of their nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. Mice receiving IN\u2009+\u2009FUS had significantly increased TH immunoreactivity in the treated hemisphere compared to the untreated hemisphere while mice receiving only FUS-induced BBB opening or no treatment at all did not show any differences. Additionally, behavioral changes were only observed in the IN\u2009+\u2009FUS treated mice, indicating improved motor control function in the treated hemisphere. These findings demonstrate the robustness of the method and potential of IN\u2009+\u2009FUS for the delivery of bioactive factors for treatment of neurodegenerative disorder.",

        "Abstract": "Maintaining a pool of functional mitochondria requires degradation of damaged ones within the cell. PINK1 is critical in this quality-control process: loss of mitochondrial membrane potential causes PINK1 to accumulate on the mitochondrial surface, triggering mitophagy. However, little is known about how PINK1 is regulated. Recently, we showed that PINK1 content is kept low in healthy mitochondria by continuous ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of its mature form via a mechanism inconsistent with the proposed N-end rule process. Using both human female and monkey cell lines, we now demonstrate that once generated within the mitochondria, 52 kDa PINK1 adopts a mitochondrial topology most consistent with it being at the mitochondrial-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) interface. From this particular submitochondrial location, PINK1 interacts with components of the ER-associated degradation pathway, such as the E3 ligases gp78 and HRD1, which cooperate to catalyze PINK1 ubiquitination. The valosin-containing protein and its cofactor, UFD1, then target ubiquitinated PINK1 for proteasomal degradation. Our data show that PINK1 in healthy mitochondria is negatively regulated via an interplay between mitochondria and ER, and shed light on how this mitochondrial protein gains access to the proteasome.",

        "Abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents most drugs from gaining access to the brain parenchyma, which is a recognized impediment to the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD). Focused ultrasound (FUS), in conjunction with systemically administered microbubbles, opens the BBB locally, reversibly and non-invasively. Herein, we show that neither FUS applied over both the striatum and the ventral midbrain, without neurotrophic factors, nor intravenous administration of neurotrophic factors (either through protein or gene delivery) without FUS, ameliorates the damage to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in the sub-acute MPTP mouse model of early-stage PD. Conversely, the combination of FUS and intravenous neurotrophic (protein or gene) delivery attenuates the damage to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, by allowing the entry of these agents into the brain parenchyma. Our findings provide evidence that the application of FUS at the early stages of PD facilitates critical neurotrophic delivery that can curb the rapid progression of neurodegeneration while improving the neuronal function, seemingly opening new therapeutic avenues for the early treatment of diseases of the central nervous system.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial respiratory deficiencies have been observed in numerous neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. For decades, these reductions in oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) have been presumed to trigger an overall bioenergetic crisis in the neuron, resulting in cell death. While the connection between respiratory defects and neuronal death has never been proven, this hypothesis has been supported by the detection of nonspecific mitochondrial DNA mutations in these disorders. These findings led to the notion that mitochondrial respiratory defects could be initiators of these common neurodegenerative disorders, instead of being consequences of a prior insult, a theory we believe to be misconstrued. Herein, we review the roots of this mitochondrial hypothesis and offer a new perspective wherein mitochondria are analyzed not only from the OxPhos point of view, but also as a complex organelle residing at the epicenter of many metabolic pathways.",

        "Abstract": "In experimental models, both in vivo and cellular, over-expression of Parkinson's linked mutant leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is sufficient to induce neuronal death. While several cell death associated proteins have been linked to LRRK2, either as protein interactors or as putative substrates, characterization of the neuronal death cascade remains elusive. In this study, we have mapped for the first time the domain within LRRK2 that mediates the interaction with FADD, thereby activating the molecular machinery of the extrinsic death pathway. Using homology modeling and molecular docking approaches, we have identified a critical motif within the N-terminal armadillo repeat region of LRRK2. Moreover, we show that co-expression of fragments of LRRK2 that contain the FADD binding motif, or deletion of this motif itself, blocks the interaction with FADD, and is neuroprotective. We further demonstrate that downstream of FADD, the mitochondrial proteins Bid and Bax are recruited to the death cascade and are necessary for neuronal death. Our work identifies multiple novel points within neuronal death signaling pathways that could potentially be targeted by candidate therapeutic strategies and highlight how the extrinsic pathway can be activated intracellularly in a pathogenic context.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area are more resistant to this degeneration than those in the SNc, though the mechanisms for selective resistance or vulnerability remain poorly understood. A key to elucidating these processes may lie within the subset of DA neurons that corelease glutamate and express the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2. Here, we addressed the potential relationship between VGLUT expression and DA neuronal vulnerability by overexpressing VGLUT in DA neurons of flies and mice. In Drosophila, VGLUT overexpression led to loss of select DA neuron populations. Similarly, expression of VGLUT2 specifically in murine SNc DA neurons led to neuronal loss and Parkinsonian behaviors. Other neuronal cell types showed no such sensitivity, suggesting that DA neurons are distinctively vulnerable to VGLUT2 expression. Additionally, most DA neurons expressed VGLUT2 during development, and coexpression of VGLUT2 with DA markers increased following injury in the adult. Finally, conditional deletion of VGLUT2 made DA neurons more susceptible to Parkinsonian neurotoxins. These data suggest that the balance of VGLUT2 expression is a crucial determinant of DA neuron survival. Ultimately, manipulation of this VGLUT2-dependent process may represent an avenue for therapeutic development.",

        "Abstract": "Along with Parkin, PINK1 plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. Although PINK1 is expressed constitutively, its level is kept low in healthy mitochondria by polyubiquitination and ensuing proteasomal degradation of its mature, 52\u00a0kDa, form. We show here that the target of PINK1 polyubiquitination is the mature form and is mediated by ubiquitination of a conserved lysine at position 137. Notably, the full-length protein also contains Lys-137 but is not ubiquitinated. On the basis of our data, we propose that cleavage of full-length PINK1 at Phe-104 disrupts the major hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain in the protein, inducing a conformation change in the resultant mature form that exposes Lys-137 to the cytosol for subsequent modification by the ubiquitination machinery. Thus, the balance between the full-length and mature PINK1 allows its levels to be regulated via ubiquitination of the mature form and ensures that PINK1 functions as a mitochondrial quality control factor.",

        "Abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests neuroinflammation is a key process in glaucoma, yet the precise roles are not known. Understanding these complex processes, which may also be a key in other common neurodegenerations such as Alzheimer's disease, will lead to targeted therapeutics for a disease that affects as many as 80 million people worldwide. Here, we define neuroinflammation as any immune-relevant response by a variety of cell types including astrocytes, microglia, and peripherally derived cells occurring in the optic nerve head and/or retina. In this review article, we first discuss clinical evidence for neuroinflammation in glaucoma and define neuroinflammation in glaucoma. We then review the inflammatory pathways that have been associated with glaucoma. Finally, we set out key research directions that we believe will greatly advance our understanding of the role of neuroinflammation in glaucoma. This review arose from a discussion of neuroinflammation in glaucoma at the 2015 meeting of The Lasker/IRRF Initiative for Innovation in Vision Science. This manuscript sets out to summarize one of these sessions; \"Inflammation and Glaucomatous Neurodegeneration\", as well as to review the current state of the literature surrounding neuroinflammation in glaucoma.",

        "Abstract": "Neurons rely heavily on mitochondria for their function and survival. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. PGC-1\u03b1 is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Here we identify necdin as a potent PGC-1\u03b1 stabilizer that promotes mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1\u03b1 in mammalian neurons. Expression of genes encoding mitochondria-specific proteins decreases significantly in necdin-null cortical neurons, where mitochondrial function and expression of the PGC-1\u03b1 protein are reduced. Necdin strongly stabilizes PGC-1\u03b1 by inhibiting its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Forced expression of necdin enhances mitochondrial function in primary cortical neurons and human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to prevent mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitor-induced degeneration. Moreover, overexpression of necdin in the substantia nigra in vivo of adult mice protects dopaminergic neurons against degeneration in experimental Parkinson's disease. These data reveal that necdin promotes mitochondrial biogenesis through stabilization of endogenous PGC-1\u03b1 to exert neuroprotection against mitochondrial insults.",

        "Abstract": "For degenerative disorders of the CNS, the main obstacle to therapeutic advancement has been the challenge of identifying the key molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal loss. We developed a combinatorial approach including translational profiling and brain regulatory network analysis to search for key determinants of neuronal survival or death. Following the generation of transgenic mice for cell type-specific profiling of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, we established and compared translatome libraries reflecting the molecular signature of these cells at baseline or under degenerative stress. Analysis of these libraries by interrogating a context-specific brain regulatory network led to the identification of a repertoire of intrinsic upstream regulators that drive the dopaminergic stress response. The altered activity of these regulators was not associated with changes in their expression levels. This strategy can be generalized for the identification of molecular determinants involved in the degeneration of other classes of neurons.",

        "Abstract": "Neurodegenerative phenotypes reflect complex, time-dependent molecular processes whose elucidation may reveal neuronal class-specific therapeutic targets. The current focus in neurodegeneration has been on individual genes and pathways. In contrast, we assembled a genome-wide regulatory model (henceforth, \"interactome\"), whose unbiased interrogation revealed 23 candidate causal master regulators of neurodegeneration in an in vitro model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), characterized by a loss of spinal motor neurons (MNs). Of these, eight were confirmed as specific MN death drivers in our model of familial ALS, including NF-\u03baB, which has long been considered a pro-survival factor. Through an extensive array of molecular, pharmacological, and biochemical approaches, we have confirmed that neuronal NF-\u03baB drives the degeneration of MNs in both familial and sporadic models of ALS, thus providing proof of principle that regulatory network analysis is a valuable tool for studying cell-specific mechanisms of neurodegeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Progressive neuronal cell loss in a small subset of brainstem and mesencephalic nuclei and widespread aggregation of the \u03b1-synuclein protein in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. Most cases occur sporadically, but mutations in several genes, including SNCA, which encodes \u03b1-synuclein, are associated with disease development. The discovery and development of therapeutic strategies to block cell death in Parkinson's disease has been limited by a lack of understanding of the mechanisms driving neurodegeneration. However, increasing evidence of multiple pivotal roles of \u03b1-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease has led researchers to consider the therapeutic potential of several strategies aimed at reduction of \u03b1-synuclein toxicity. We critically assess the potential of experimental therapies targeting \u03b1-synuclein, and discuss steps that need to be taken for target validation and drug development.",

        "Abstract": "Familial cases of Parkinson's disease (PD) can be associated with overexpression or mutation of \u03b1-synuclein, a synaptic protein reported to be localized mainly in the cytosol and mitochondria. We recently showed that wild-type \u03b1-synuclein is not present in mitochondria, as previously thought, but rather is located in mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Remarkably, we also found that PD-related mutated \u03b1-synuclein results in its reduced association with mitochondria-associated membranes, coincident with a lower degree of apposition of endoplasmic reticulum with mitochondria and an increase in mitochondrial fragmentation, as compared with wild-type. This new subcellular localization of \u03b1-synuclein raises fundamental questions regarding the relationship of \u03b1-synuclein to mitochondria-associated membranes function, in both normal and pathological states. In this article, we attempt to relate aspects of PD pathogenesis to what is known about mitochondria-associated membranes' behavior and function. We hypothesize that early events occurring in dopaminergic neurons at the level of the mitochondria-associated membranes could cause long-term disturbances that lead to PD.",

        "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence from genetic and biochemical studies implicates dysfunction of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway as a key feature in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Most studies have focused on accumulation of neurotoxic \u03b1-synuclein secondary to defects in autophagy as the cause of neurodegeneration, but abnormalities of the autophagic-lysosomal system likely mediate toxicity through multiple mechanisms. To further explore how endolysosomal dysfunction causes PD-related neurodegeneration, we generated a murine model of Kufor-Rakeb syndrome (KRS), characterized by early-onset Parkinsonism with additional neurological features. KRS is caused by recessive loss-of-function mutations in the ATP13A2 gene encoding the endolysosomal ATPase ATP13A2. We show that loss of ATP13A2 causes a specific protein trafficking defect, and that Atp13a2 null mice develop age-related motor dysfunction that is preceded by neuropathological changes, including gliosis, accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, lipofuscinosis, and endolysosomal abnormalities. Contrary to predictions from in vitro data, in vivo mouse genetic studies demonstrate that these phenotypes are \u03b1-synuclein independent. Our findings indicate that endolysosomal dysfunction and abnormalities of \u03b1-synuclein homeostasis are not synonymous, even in the context of an endolysosomal genetic defect linked to Parkinsonism, and highlight the presence of \u03b1-synuclein-independent neurotoxicity consequent to endolysosomal dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "\u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) is one of the genes that when mutated or overexpressed causes Parkinson's Disease (PD). Initially, it was described as a synaptic terminal protein and later was found to be localized at mitochondria. Mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) have emerged as a central endoplasmic reticulum (ER) subcellular compartments where key functions of the cell occur. These domains, enriched in cholesterol and anionic phospholipids, are where calcium homeostasis, lipid transfer, and cholesterol metabolism are regulated. Some proteins, related to mitochondrial dynamics and function, are also localized to this area. Several neurodegenerative diseases have shown alterations in MAM functions and resident proteins, including Charcot Marie-Tooth and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have recently reported that MAM function is downregulated in cell and mouse models of PD expressing pathogenic mutations of \u03b1-syn. This review focuses on the possible role of \u03b1-syn in these cellular domains and the early pathogenic features of PD that could be explained by \u03b1-syn-MAM disturbances.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects about 1.5% of the global population over 65 years of age. A hallmark feature of PD is the degeneration of the dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the consequent striatal DA deficiency. Yet, the pathogenesis of PD remains unclear. Despite tremendous growth in recent years in our knowledge of the molecular basis of PD and the molecular pathways of cell death, important questions remain, such as: (1) why are SNc cells especially vulnerable; (2) which mechanisms underlie progressive SNc cell loss; and (3) what do Lewy bodies or \u03b1-synuclein reveal about disease progression. Understanding the variable vulnerability of the dopaminergic neurons from the midbrain and the mechanisms whereby pathology becomes widespread are some of the primary objectives of research in PD. Animal models are the best tools to study the pathogenesis of PD. The identification of PD-related genes has led to the development of genetic PD models as an alternative to the classical toxin-based ones, but does the dopaminergic neuronal loss in actual animal models adequately recapitulate that of the human disease? The selection of a particular animal model is very important for the specific goals of the different experiments. In this review, we provide a summary of our current knowledge about the different in vivo models of PD that are used in relation to the vulnerability of the dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain in the pathogenesis of PD.",

        "Abstract": "To explore the link between bioenergetics and motor neuron degeneration, we used a computational model in which detailed morphology and ion conductance are paired with intracellular ATP production and consumption. We found that reduced ATP availability increases the metabolic cost of a single action potential and disrupts K+/Na+ homeostasis, resulting in a chronic depolarization. The magnitude of the ATP shortage at which this ionic instability occurs depends on the morphology and intrinsic conductance characteristic of the neuron. If ATP shortage is confined to the distal part of the axon, the ensuing local ionic instability eventually spreads to the whole neuron and involves fasciculation-like spiking events. A shortage of ATP also causes a rise in intracellular calcium. Our modeling work supports the notion that mitochondrial dysfunction can account for salient features of the paralytic disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, including motor neuron hyperexcitability, fasciculation, and differential vulnerability of motor neuron subpopulations.",

        "Abstract": "Most cases of neurodegenerative diseases are sporadic, hindering the use of genetic mouse models to analyze disease mechanisms. Focusing on the motor neuron (MN) disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we therefore devised a fully humanized coculture model composed of human adult primary sporadic ALS (sALS) astrocytes and human embryonic stem-cell-derived MNs. The model reproduces the cardinal features of human ALS: sALS astrocytes, but not those from control patients, trigger selective death of MNs. The mechanisms underlying this non-cell-autonomous toxicity were investigated in both astrocytes and MNs. Although causal in familial ALS (fALS), SOD1 does not contribute to the toxicity of sALS astrocytes. Death of MNs triggered by either sALS or fALS astrocytes occurs through necroptosis, a form of programmed necrosis involving receptor-interacting protein 1 and the mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein. The necroptotic pathway therefore constitutes a potential therapeutic target for this\u00a0incurable disease.",

        "Abstract": "Familial Parkinson disease is associated with mutations in \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), a presynaptic protein that has been localized not only to the cytosol, but also to mitochondria. We report here that wild-type \u03b1-syn from cell lines, and brain tissue from humans and mice, is present not in mitochondria but rather in mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAM), a structurally and functionally distinct subdomain of the ER. Remarkably, we found that pathogenic point mutations in human \u03b1-syn result in its reduced association with MAM, coincident with a lower degree of apposition of ER with mitochondria, a decrease in MAM function, and an increase in mitochondrial fragmentation compared with wild-type. Although overexpression of wild-type \u03b1-syn in mutant \u03b1-syn-expressing cells reverted the fragmentation phenotype, neither overexpression of the mitochondrial fusion/MAM-tethering protein MFN2 nor inhibition/ablation of the mitochondrial fission protein DRP1 was able to do so, implying that \u03b1-syn operates downstream of the mitochondrial fusion/fission machinery. These novel results indicate that wild-type \u03b1-syn localizes to the MAM and modulates mitochondrial morphology, and that these behaviors are impaired by pathogenic mutations in \u03b1-syn. We believe that our results have far-reaching implications for both our understanding of \u03b1-syn biology and the treatment of synucleinopathies.",

        "Abstract": "PINK1 is a mitochondrial kinase proposed to have a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease through the regulation of mitophagy. Here, we show that the PINK1 main cleavage product, PINK152, after being generated inside mitochondria, can exit these organelles and localize to the cytosol, where it is not only destined for degradation by the proteasome but binds to Parkin. The interaction of cytosolic PINK1 with Parkin represses Parkin translocation to the mitochondria and subsequent mitophagy. Our work therefore highlights the existence of two cellular pools of PINK1 that have different effects on Parkin translocation and mitophagy.",

        "Abstract": "Differentiation of astrocytes from human stem cells has significant potential for analysis of their role in normal brain function and disease, but existing protocols generate only immature astrocytes. Using early neuralization, we generated spinal cord astrocytes from mouse or human embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells with high efficiency. Remarkably, short exposure to fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) or FGF2 was sufficient to direct these astrocytes selectively toward a mature quiescent phenotype, as judged by both marker expression and functional analysis. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1\u03b2, but not FGFs, induced multiple elements of a reactive inflammatory phenotype but did not affect maturation. These phenotypically defined, scalable populations of spinal cord astrocytes will be important both for studying normal astrocyte function and for modeling human pathological processes in vitro.",

        "Abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized phenotypically by progressive weakness and neuropathologically by loss of motor neurons. Phenotypically, there is marked heterogeneity. Typical ALS has mixed upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) involvement. Primary lateral sclerosis has predominant UMN involvement. Progressive muscular atrophy has predominant LMN involvement. Bulbar and limb ALS have predominant regional involvement. Frontotemporal dementia has significant cognitive and behavioral involvement. These phenotypes can be so distinctive that they would seem to have differing biology. However, they cannot be distinguished, at least neuropathologically or genetically. In sporadic ALS (SALS), they are mostly characterized by ubiquitinated cytoplasmic inclusions of TDP-43. In familial ALS (FALS), where phenotypes are indistinguishable from SALS and similarly heterogeneous, each mutated gene has its own genetic and molecular signature. Overall, since the same phenotypes can have multiple causes including different gene mutations, there must be multiple molecular mechanisms causing ALS - and ALS is a syndrome. Since, however, multiple phenotypes can be caused by one single gene mutation, a single molecular mechanism can cause heterogeneity. What the mechanisms are remain unknown, but active propagation of the pathology neuroanatomically seems to be a principal component. Leading candidate mechanisms include RNA processing, cell-cell interactions between neurons and non-neuronal neighbors, focal seeding from a misfolded protein that has prion-like propagation, and fatal errors introduced during neurodevelopment of the motor system. If fundamental mechanisms could be identified and understood, ALS therapy could rationally target progression and stop the disease - a goal that seems increasingly achievable.",

        "Abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal disease characterized by the unremitting degeneration of motor neurons. Multiple processes involving motor neurons and other cell types have been implicated in its pathogenesis. Neural stem cells (NSCs) perform multiple actions within the nervous system to fulfill their functions of organogenesis and homeostasis. We test the hypothesis that transplanted, undifferentiated multipotent migratory NSCs may help to ameliorate an array of pathological mechanisms in the SOD1(G93A) transgenic mouse model of ALS. On the basis of a meta-analysis of 11 independent studies performed by a consortium of ALS investigators, we propose that transplanted NSCs (both mouse and human) can slow both the onset and the progression of clinical signs and prolong survival in ALS mice, particularly if regions sustaining vital functions such as respiration are rendered chimeric. The beneficial effects of transplanted NSCs seem to be mediated by a number of actions including their ability to produce trophic factors, preserve neuromuscular function, and reduce astrogliosis and inflammation. We conclude that the widespread, pleiotropic, modulatory actions exerted by transplanted NSCs may represent an accessible therapeutic application of stem cells for treating ALS and other untreatable degenerative diseases.",

        "Title": "Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy.",
        "Abstract": "In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field.",

        "Abstract": "Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of many neurological disorders has been greatly enhanced by the discovery of mutations in genes linked to familial forms of these diseases. These have facilitated the generation of cell and animal models that can be used to understand the underlying molecular pathology. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the use of patient-derived cells, due to the development of induced pluripotent stem cells and their subsequent differentiation into neurons and glia. Access to patient cell lines carrying the relevant mutations is a limiting factor for many centres wishing to pursue this research. We have therefore generated an open-access collection of fibroblast lines from patients carrying mutations linked to neurological disease. These cell lines have been deposited in the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Repository at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research and can be requested by any research group for use in in vitro disease modelling. There are currently 71 mutation-defined cell lines available for request from a wide range of neurological disorders and this collection will be continually expanded. This represents a significant resource that will advance the use of patient cells as disease models by the scientific community.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a common adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder whose pathogenesis remains essentially unknown. Currently, it is believed that the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson's disease is a combination of both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. Proposed cell-autonomous mechanisms include alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetics, dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, and impaired turnover of mitochondria. As for the proposed non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, they involve prion-like behavior of misfolded proteins and neuroinflammation. This suggests that cell death in Parkinson's disease is caused by a multifactorial cascade of pathogenic events and argues that effective neuroprotective therapy for Parkinson's disease may have to rely on multiple drug interventions.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. Pathologically, it is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Although most occurrences have an unknown cause, several gene mutations have been linked to familial forms of PD. The discovery of some of the proteins encoded by these genes, including Parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1, at the mitochondria offered a new perspective on the involvement of mitochondria in PD. Specifically, these proteins are thought to be involved in the maintenance of a healthy pool of mitochondria by regulating their turnover by mitochondrial autophagy, or mitophagy. In this review, we discuss recent studies on the role of mitophagy in PD. We present three putative models whereby PINK1 and Parkin may affect mitophagy; 1) by shifting the balance between fusion and fission of the mitochondrial network, 2) by modulating mitochondrial motility and 3) by directly recruiting the autophagic machinery to damaged mitochondria.

        "Title": "The Role of the Innate Immune System in ALS.",
        "Abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, adult-onset neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the death of upper and lower motor neurons. Recent studies have made it clear that although motor neurons are the primary targets of the degenerative process, other cell types play key roles in the death of motor neurons. Most notably, cells of the immune system, including astrocytes and microglia have come under increasing scrutiny, after multiple lines of evidence have shown these cells to be deleterious to motor neurons. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that astrocytes and microglia containing mutated SOD1 are harmful to motor neurons. Several studies on ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases have revealed that reactive astrocytes and microglia are capable of releasing pro-inflammatory factors such as cytokines and chemokines, which are harmful to neighboring neurons. In addition, it is believed that diseased astrocytes can specifically kill motor neurons through the release of toxic factors. Furthermore, in an animal model of the disease, it has been shown that the reduction of SOD1 in microglia may be able to slow the progression of ALS symptoms. Although the exact pathways of motor neuron death in ALS have yet to be elucidated, studies have suggested that they die through aBax-dependent signaling pathway. Mounting evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays an important role in the degeneration of motor neurons. Based on these findings, anti-inflammatory compounds are currently being tested for their potential to reduce disease severity; however, these studies are only in the preliminary stages. While we understand that astrocytes and microglia play a role in the death of motor neurons in ALS, much work needs to be done to fully understand ALS pathology and the role the immune system plays in disease onset and progression.",

        "Abstract": "Non cell-autonomous processes are thought to play critical roles in the cellular maintenance of the healthy and diseased brain but mechanistic details remain unclear. We report that the interruption of a non cell-autonomous mode of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling originating from dopaminergic neurons causes progressive, adult-onset degeneration of dopaminergic, cholinergic, and fast spiking GABAergic neurons of the mesostriatal circuit, imbalance of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, and motor deficits reminiscent of Parkinson's disease. Variable Shh signaling results in graded inhibition of muscarinic autoreceptor- and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-expression in the striatum. Reciprocally, graded signals that emanate from striatal cholinergic neurons and engage the canonical GDNF receptor Ret inhibit Shh expression in dopaminergic neurons. Thus, we discovered a mechanism for neuronal subtype specific and reciprocal communication that is essential for neurochemical and structural homeostasis in the nigrostriatal circuit. These results provide integrative insights into non cell-autonomous processes likely at play in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder caused by genetic and environmental factors that results in degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in the brain. We analyzed neural cells generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from PD patients and presymptomatic individuals carrying mutations in the PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) and LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) genes, and compared them to those of healthy control subjects. We measured several aspects of mitochondrial responses in the iPSC-derived neural cells including production of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial respiration, proton leakage, and intraneuronal movement of mitochondria. Cellular vulnerability associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in iPSC-derived neural cells from familial PD patients and at-risk individuals could be rescued with coenzyme Q(10), rapamycin, or the LRRK2 kinase inhibitor GW5074. Analysis of mitochondrial responses in iPSC-derived neural cells from PD patients carrying different mutations provides insight into convergence of cellular disease mechanisms between different familial forms of PD and highlights the importance of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in this neurodegenerative disease.",

        "Title": "Mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), a cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, disrupts the recruitment of SMN, the spinal muscular atrophy protein to nuclear Cajal bodies.",
        "Abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are among the most common motor neuron diseases to afflict the human population. A deficiency of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein causes SMA and is also reported to be an exacerbating factor in the development of ALS. However, pathways linking the two diseases have yet to be defined and it is not clear precisely how the pathology of ALS is aggravated by reduced SMN or whether mutant proteins underlying familial forms of ALS interfere with SMN-related biochemical pathways to exacerbate the neurodegenerative process. In this study, we show that mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), a cause of familial ALS, profoundly alters the sub-cellular localization of the SMN protein, preventing the formation of nuclear 'gems' by disrupting the recruitment of the protein to Cajal bodies. Overexpressing the SMN protein in mutant SOD1 mice, a model of familial ALS, alleviates this phenomenon, most likely in a cell-autonomous manner, and significantly mitigates the loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and in culture dishes. In the mice, the onset of the neuromuscular phenotype is delayed and motor function enhanced, suggestive of a therapeutic benefit for ALS patients treated with agents that augment the SMN protein. Nevertheless, this finding is tempered by an inability to prolong survival, a limitation most likely imposed by the inexorable denervation that characterizes ALS and eventually disrupts the neuromuscular synapses even in the presence of increased SMN.",

        "Abstract": "The Parkinson disease-associated kinase Pink1 is targeted to mitochondria where it is thought to regulate mitochondrial quality control by promoting the selective autophagic removal of dysfunctional mitochondria. Nevertheless, the targeting mode of Pink1 and its submitochondrial localization are still not conclusively resolved. The aim of this study was to dissect the mitochondrial import pathway of Pink1 by use of a highly sensitive in vitro assay. Mutational analysis of the Pink1 sequence revealed that its N terminus acts as a genuine matrix localization sequence that mediates the initial membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8)-dependent targeting of the Pink1 precursor to the inner mitochondrial membrane, but it is dispensable for Pink1 import or processing. A hydrophobic segment downstream of the signal sequence impeded complete translocation of Pink1 across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Additionally, the C-terminal end of the protein promoted the retention of Pink1 at the outer membrane. Thus, multiple targeting signals featured by the Pink1 sequence result in the final localization of both the full-length protein and its major \u0394\u03c8-dependent cleavage product to the cytosolic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Full-length Pink1 and deletion constructs resembling the natural Pink1 processing product were found to assemble into membrane potential-sensitive high molecular weight protein complexes at the mitochondrial surface and displayed similar cytoprotective effects when expressed in vivo, indicating that both species are functionally relevant.",

        "Abstract": "Neurological disorders can be modeled in animals so as to recreate specific pathogenic events and behavioral outcomes. Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease of an aging population, and although there have been several significant findings about the PD disease process, much of this process still remains a mystery. Breakthroughs in the last two decades using animal models have offered insights into the understanding of the PD disease process, its etiology, pathology, and molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, while cellular models have helped to identify specific events, animal models, both toxic and genetic, have replicated almost all of the hallmarks of PD and are useful for testing new neuroprotective or neurorestorative strategies. Moreover, significant advances in the modeling of additional PD features have come to light in both classic and newer models. In this review, we try to provide an updated summary of the main characteristics of these models as well as the strengths and weaknesses of what we believe to be the most popular PD animal models. These models include those produced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), 1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropiridine (MPTP), rotenone, and paraquat, as well as several genetic models like those related to alpha-synuclein, PINK1, Parkin and LRRK2 alterations.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the emergence of autophagy as a key process for mitochondrial quality control, the existence and persistence of pathogenic mtDNA mutations in human disease suggests that the degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria does not occur widely in vivo. During macroautophagy, a double-membraned cup-shaped structure engulfs cytosolic content. This autophagic vesicle then fuses with lysosomes, allowing hydrolytic enzymes to degrade the contents. Mitochondrial autophagy, or mitophagy, is thought to degrade damaged or nonfunctioning mitochondria specifically. The Parkinson disease-related proteins PINK1 (a mitochondrially localized kinase) and PARK2 (PARKIN, a cytosolically-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase) are essential for targeting mitochondria for mitophagy. Upon chemical uncoupling of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (\u0394\u03c8(m)), PINK1 located in the mitochondrial outer membrane recruits PARK2 from the cytosol to the mitochondria, followed by delivery of the organelle to the autophagic machinery for degradation.",

        "Title": "Mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetic dysfunction is associated with synaptic alterations in mutant SOD1 motor neurons.",
        "Abstract": "Mutations in Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), a rapidly fatal motor neuron disease. Mutant SOD1 has pleiotropic toxic effects on motor neurons, among which mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed as one of the contributing factors in motor neuron demise. Mitochondria are highly dynamic in neurons; they are constantly reshaped by fusion and move along neurites to localize at sites of high-energy utilization, such as synapses. The finding of abnormal mitochondria accumulation in neuromuscular junctions, where the SOD1-FALS degenerative process is though to initiate, suggests that impaired mitochondrial dynamics in motor neurons may be involved in pathogenesis. We addressed this hypothesis by live imaging microscopy of photo-switchable fluorescent mitoDendra in transgenic rat motor neurons expressing mutant or wild-type human SOD1. We demonstrate that mutant SOD1 motor neurons have impaired mitochondrial fusion in axons and cell bodies. Mitochondria also display selective impairment of retrograde axonal transport, with reduced frequency and velocity of movements. Fusion and transport defects are associated with smaller mitochondrial size, decreased mitochondrial density, and defective mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, mislocalization of mitochondria at synapses among motor neurons, in vitro, correlates with abnormal synaptic number, structure, and function. Dynamics abnormalities are specific to mutant SOD1 motor neuron mitochondria, since they are absent in wild-type SOD1 motor neurons, they do not involve other organelles, and they are not found in cortical neurons. Together, these results suggest that impaired mitochondrial dynamics may contribute to the selective degeneration of motor neurons in SOD1-FALS.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) accompanied by a buildup of proteinaceous aggregates termed Lewy bodies (LB). In addition to protein aggregation and the loss of DA signaling, PD is also characterized by an active immune response. T-cell infiltration accompanies activated microglial and astrocytic accumulation in and around the SNpc. Although potentially beneficial, microglial activation is most likely responsible for furthering disease pathology and DA neuron degeneration through the release of harmful substances such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxidative species and reactive nitrogen species. Activation of the NF-\u03baB death pathway has been shown to occur following microglial activation related release of Cox-2, IL-1\u03b2, and Toll-like receptor activation, resulting in increased degeneration of DA neurons of the SNpc. Blockade of microglial activation can lead to DA neuron protection in animal models of PD; however, clinical application of anti-inflammatory drugs has not yielded similar benefits. Future therapeutic designs must take into account the multifactorial nature of PD, including the varied roles of the adaptive and innate immune responses.",

To this end, a number of animal models are in use. These models parallel our thinking about the etiology of PD. Thus, herein, we discuss the most popular neurotoxin animal models, 6-hydroxydopamine and MPTP as one school of thought believes that PD is the result of a toxic insult. Since several researchers think that pesticide and herbicide use can increase the risk of developing PD, we review some of the aspects of rotenone and paraquat in rodents. Furthermore, now that we know that 10% of all PD cases are genetic in nature, we discuss some of the more common genetic rodent models of PD. None of the above models captures all of the hallmarks of PD. Thus, a given model should never be used indiscriminately to investigate every question, but should instead be carefully selected on the basis of being the most suitable model for the question being asked.",

        "Abstract": "Autophagy has emerged as a key cellular process for organellar quality control, yet this pathway apparently fails to eliminate mitochondria containing pathogenic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in patients with a variety of human diseases. In order to explore how mtDNA-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction interacts with endogenous autophagic pathways, we examined autophagic status in a panel of human cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cell lines carrying a variety of pathogenic mtDNA mutations. We found that both genetic- and chemically induced loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (\u0394\u03c8(m)) caused recruitment of the pro-mitophagic factor Parkin to mitochondria. Strikingly, however, the loss of \u0394\u03c8(m) alone was insufficient to prompt delivery of mitochondria to the autophagosome (mitophagy). We found that mitophagy could be induced following treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin in cybrids carrying either large-scale partial deletions of mtDNA or complete depletion of mtDNA. Further, we found that the level of endogenous Parkin is a crucial determinant of mitophagy. These results suggest a two-hit model, in which the synergistic induction of both (i) mitochondrial recruitment of Parkin following the loss of \u0394\u03c8(m) and (ii) mTORC1-controlled general macroautophagy is required for mitophagy. It appears that mitophagy can be accomplished by the endogenous autophagic machinery, but requires the full engagement of both of these pathways.",

        "Abstract": "Abnormalities in mitochondrial function and epigenetic regulation are thought to be instrumental in Huntington's disease (HD), a fatal genetic disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine track in the protein huntingtin. Given the lack of effective therapies for HD, we sought to assess the neuroprotective properties of the mitochondrial energizing ketone body, D-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (D\u03b2HB), in the 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) toxic and the R6/2 genetic model of HD. In mice treated with 3-NP, a complex II inhibitor, infusion of D\u03b2HB attenuates motor deficits, striatal lesions, and microgliosis in this model of toxin induced-striatal neurodegeneration. In transgenic R6/2 mice, infusion of D\u03b2HB extends life span, attenuates motor deficits, and prevents striatal histone deacetylation. In PC12 cells with inducible expression of mutant huntingtin protein, we further demonstrate that D\u03b2HB prevents histone deacetylation via a mechanism independent of its mitochondrial effects and independent of histone deacetylase inhibition. These pre-clinical findings suggest that by simultaneously targeting the mitochondrial and the epigenetic abnormalities associated with mutant huntingtin, D\u03b2HB may be a valuable therapeutic agent for HD.",

        "Abstract": "Adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders are disabling and often fatal diseases of the nervous system whose underlying mechanisms of cell death remain unknown. Defects in mitochondrial respiration had previously been proposed to contribute to the occurrence of many, if not all, of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. However, the discovery of genes mutated in hereditary forms of these enigmatic diseases has additionally suggested defects in mitochondrial dynamics. Such disturbances can lead to changes in mitochondrial trafficking, in interorganellar communication, and in mitochondrial quality control. These new mechanisms by which mitochondria may also be linked to neurodegeneration will likely have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder whose cardinal manifestations are due primarily to a profound deficit in brain dopamine. Since the 1980s, several therapeutic strategies have been discovered to treat the symptoms of this neurological disorder, but as of yet, none halts or retards the neurodegenerative process. In an attempt to shed light on the neurobiology of Parkinson's disease, a number of experimental models have been developed, especially during the last 25 years. They come essentially in 3 flavors: pharmacological (eg, reserpine), toxic (eg, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), and genetic (eg, transgenic synuclein mice). These models can also be recast as etiologic, pathogenic, and symptomatic/pathophysiologic, as each may contribute to our understanding of the cause, the mechanisms, and the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In this review, we will discuss the question of Parkinson's disease models, starting from the period when this journal was born to today. During this journey of 25 years, we will discuss both the significant contributions of the Parkinson's disease models and hurdles that remain to be overcome to one day cure this neurological disease.",

Some familial forms of PD are provoked by mutations in the genes encoding for the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog)-induced putative kinase-1 (PINK1) and Parkin. Mounting evidence indicates that PINK1 and Parkin might function in concert to modulate mitochondrial degradation, termed mitophagy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which PINK1/Parkin affect mitophagy are just beginning to be elucidated. Herein, we review the main advances in our understanding of the PINK1/Parkin pathway. Because of the phenotypic similarities among the different forms of PD, a better understanding of PINK1/Parkin biology might have far-reaching pathogenic and therapeutic implications for both the inherited and the sporadic forms of PD.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder associated with a loss of dopaminergic neurons. The role of mitochondria in the aetiology of PD has been questioned for decades, mostly from the perspective of bioenergetic failure. For decades, a deficit in mitochondrial respiration was thought to be a key factor in PD neurodegeneration. However, excluding a few exceptions where a clinical picture of parkinsonism is associated with a mitochondrial DNA mutation, preclinical and clinical studies have failed to identify any genetic mutations in the genes encoding for the electron transport chain complexes in PD patients. More recently, it has been discovered that mutations in the genes encoding for Parkin, PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase-1) and DJ-1 are associated with familial forms of PD and with mitochondrial alterations, including morphological abnormalities. These results have led many researchers to revisit the question of mitochondrial biology as a primary mechanism in PD pathogenesis, this time from an angle of perturbation in mitochondrial dynamics and not from the angle of a deficit in respiration.",

        "Abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases represent a growing public health challenge. Current medications treat symptoms, but none halt or retard neurodegeneration. The recent advent of pluripotent cell biology has opened new avenues for neurodegenerative disease research. The greatest potential for induced pluripotent cells derived from affected individuals is likely to be their utility for modeling and understanding the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative processes, and for searching for new treatments, including cell replacement therapies. However, much work remains to be done before pluripotent cells can be used for preclinical and clinical applications. Here we discuss the challenges of generating specific neural cell subtypes from pluripotent stem cells, the use of pluripotent stem cells to model both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration, whether adult-onset neurodegeneration can be emulated in short-term cultures and the hurdles of cell replacement therapy. Progress in these four areas will substantially accelerate effective application of pluripotent stem cells.",

Among these genes, those that code for PTEN-induced kinase-1 (PINK1) ( 2) and for the E3-ubiquitin ligase Parkin ( 3) did attract major interest from mitochondriologists, in part, because both proteins interact with each other and apparently function, genetically, within the same molecular pathway to modulate mitochondrial dynamics in Drosophila.

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder of unknown cause. For decades, a deficit in mitochondrial respiration was thought to be a key factor in PD neurodegeneration. However, excluding a few exceptions where a clinical picture of parkinsonism is associated with a mitochondrial DNA mutation, preclinical and clinical studies have failed to identify any genetic mutations in the genes encoding for the electron transport chain complexes in PD patients. More recently, it has been discovered that mutations in the genes encoding for Parkin, PINK1 and DJ1 are associated with familial forms of PD and with mitochondrial alterations, including morphological abnormalities. These results have led many researchers to revisit the question of mitochondrial biology as a primary mechanism in PD pathogenesis, this time from an angle of perturbation in mitochondrial dynamics and not from the angle of a deficit in respiration.",

        "Abstract": "We report that rapamycin, an allosteric inhibitor of certain but not all actions of the key cellular kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), protects neurons from death in both cellular and animal toxin models of Parkinson's disease (PD). This protective action appears to be attributable to blocked translation of RTP801/REDD1/Ddit4, a protein that is induced in cell and animal models of PD and in affected neurons of PD patients and that causes neuron death by leading to dephosphorylation of the survival kinase Akt. In support of this mechanism, in PD models, rapamycin spares phosphorylation of Akt at a site critical for maintenance of its survival-promoting activity. The capacity of rapamycin to provide neuroprotection in PD models appears to arise from its selective suppression of some but not all actions of mTOR, as indicated by the contrasting finding that Torin1, a full catalytic mTOR inhibitor, is not protective and induces Akt dephosphorylation and neuron death.",

        "Abstract": "Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and PARK2/Parkin mutations cause autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson's disease. Upon a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) in human cells, cytosolic Parkin has been reported to be recruited to mitochondria, which is followed by a stimulation of mitochondrial autophagy. Here, we show that the relocation of Parkin to mitochondria induced by a collapse of DeltaPsi(m) relies on PINK1 expression and that overexpression of WT but not of mutated PINK1 causes Parkin translocation to mitochondria, even in cells with normal DeltaPsi(m). We also show that once at the mitochondria, Parkin is in close proximity to PINK1, but we find no evidence that Parkin catalyzes PINK1 ubiquitination or that PINK1 phosphorylates Parkin. However, co-overexpression of Parkin and PINK1 collapses the normal tubular mitochondrial network into mitochondrial aggregates and/or large perinuclear clusters, many of which are surrounded by autophagic vacuoles. Our results suggest that Parkin, together with PINK1, modulates mitochondrial trafficking, especially to the perinuclear region, a subcellular area associated with autophagy. Thus by impairing this process, mutations in either Parkin or PINK1 may alter mitochondrial turnover which, in turn, may cause the accumulation of defective mitochondria and, ultimately, neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.",

        "Abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), there is a progressive loss of neuromelanin (NM)-containing dopamine neurons in substantia nigra (SN) which is associated with microgliosis and presence of extracellular NM. Herein, we have investigated the interplay between microglia and human NM on the degeneration of SN dopaminergic neurons. Although NM particles are phagocytized and degraded by microglia within minutes in vitro, extracellular NM particles induce microglial activation and ensuing production of superoxide, nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide (H\u2082O\u2082), and pro-inflammatory factors. Furthermore, NM produces, in a microglia-depended manner, neurodegeneration in primary ventral midbrain cultures. Neurodegeneration was effectively attenuated with microglia derived from mice deficient in macrophage antigen complex-1, a microglial integrin receptor involved in the initiation of phagocytosis. Neuronal loss was also attenuated with microglia derived from mice deficient in phagocytic oxidase, a subunit of NADPH oxidase, that is responsible for superoxide and H\u2082O\u2082 production, or apocynin, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor. In vivo, NM injected into rat SN produces microgliosis and a loss of tyrosine hydroxylase neurons. Thus, these results show that extracellular NM can activate microglia, which in turn may induce dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD. Our study may have far-reaching implications, both pathogenic and therapeutic.",

        "Abstract": "DNA damage is a proposed pathogenic factor in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease. To probe the underpinning mechanism of such neuronal perturbation, we sought to produce an experimental model of DNA damage. We thus first assessed DNA damage by in situ nick translation and emulsion autoradiography in the mouse brain after administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; 4 x 20 mg/kg, ip, every 2 h), a neurotoxin known to produce a model of Parkinson disease. Here we show that DNA strand breaks occur in vivo in this mouse model of Parkinson disease with kinetics and a topography that parallel the degeneration of substantia nigra neurons, as assessed by FluoroJade labeling. Previously, nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) were found to modulate MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal death. We thus assessed the contribution of these enzymes to DNA damage in mice lacking neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), or Cox-2. We found that the lack of Cox-2 and nNOS activities but not of iNOS activity attenuated MPTP-related DNA damage. We also found that not only nuclear, but also mitochondrial, DNA is a target for the MPTP insult. These results suggest that the loss of genomic integrity can be triggered by the concerted actions of nNOS and Cox-2 and provide further support to the view that DNA damage may contribute to the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson disease.",

        "Abstract": "Toxic organic cations can damage nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways as seen in most parkinsonian syndromes and in some cases of illicit drug exposure. Here, we show that the organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3) is expressed in nondopaminergic cells adjacent to both the soma and terminals of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. We hypothesized that Oct3 contributes to the dopaminergic damage by bidirectionally regulating the local bioavailability of toxic species. Consistent with this view, Oct3 deletion and pharmacological inhibition hampers the release of the toxic organic cation 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium from astrocytes and protects against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in mice. Furthermore, Oct3 deletion impairs the removal of the excess extracellular dopamine induced by methamphetamine and enhances striatal dopaminergic terminal damage caused by this psychostimulant. These results may have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the mechanism of cell death in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases and may open new avenues for neuroprotective intervention.",

        "Title": "Oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease: a mechanism of pathogenic and therapeutic significance.",
        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder. Typically PD is a sporadic neurological disorder, and over time affected patients see their disability growing and their quality of life declining. Oxidative stress has been hypothesized to be linked to both the initiation and the progression of PD. Preclinical findings from both in vitro and in vivo experimental models of PD suggest that the neurodegenerative process starts with otherwise healthy neurons being hit by some etiological factors, which sets into motion a cascade of deleterious events. In these models initial molecular alterations in degenerating dopaminergic neurons include increased formation of reactive oxygen species, presumably originating from both inside and outside the mitochondria. In the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD, time-course experiments suggest that oxidative stress is an early event that may directly kill some of the dopaminergic neurons. In this model it seems that oxidative stress may play a greater role in the demise of dopaminergic neurons indirectly by activating intracellular, cell death-related, molecular pathways. As the neurodegenerative process evolves in the MPTP mouse model, indices of neuroinflammation develop, such as microglial activation. The latter increases the level of oxidative stress to which the neighboring compromised neurons are subjected to, thereby promoting their demise. However, these experimental studies have also shown that oxidative stress is not the sole deleterious factor implicated in the death of dopaminergic neurons. Should a similar multifactorial cascade underlie dopaminergic neuron degeneration in PD, then the optimal therapy for this disease may have to rely on a cocktail of agents, each targeting a different critical component of this hypothesized pathogenic cascade. If correct, this may be a reason why neuroprotective trials using a single agent, such as an antioxidant, have thus far generated disappointing results.",

        "Abstract": "The intrabody technology has become a promising therapeutic avenue for a variety of incurable diseases. This technology is an intracellular application of gene-engineered antibodies, aimed at ablating the abnormal function of intracellular molecules. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with no cure. Recent studies have explored possible intrabody applications against alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), whose misfolding is believed to cause a familial form of PD. Here, we review the origin, production, and therapeutic mechanisms of intrabodies and the potential of intrabody protection against alpha-syn toxicity. Furthermore, we propose possible intrabody applications against leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), whose mutations are the most frequent known cause of familial and sporadic PD.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) are a cause of autosomal recessive familial Parkinson's disease (PD). Efforts in deducing the PINK1 signaling pathway have been hindered by controversy around its subcellular and submitochondrial localization and the authenticity of its reported substrates. We show here that this mitochondrial protein exhibits a topology in which the kinase domain faces the cytoplasm and the N-terminal tail is inside the mitochondria. Although deletion of the transmembrane domain disrupts this topology, common PD-linked PINK1 mutations do not. These results are critical in rectifying the location and orientation of PINK1 in mitochondria, and they should help decipher its normal physiological function and potential pathogenic role in PD.",

        "Abstract": "Altered degradation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD). We have shown that alpha-syn can be degraded via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective lysosomal mechanism for degradation of cytosolic proteins. Pathogenic mutants of alpha-syn block lysosomal translocation, impairing their own degradation along with that of other CMA substrates. While pathogenic alpha-syn mutations are rare, alpha-syn undergoes posttranslational modifications, which may underlie its accumulation in cytosolic aggregates in most forms of PD. Using mouse ventral medial neuron cultures, SH-SY5Y cells in culture, and isolated mouse lysosomes, we have found that most of these posttranslational modifications of alpha-syn impair degradation of this protein by CMA but do not affect degradation of other substrates. Dopamine-modified alpha-syn, however, is not only poorly degraded by CMA but also blocks degradation of other substrates by this pathway. As blockage of CMA increases cellular vulnerability to stressors, we propose that dopamine-induced autophagic inhibition could explain the selective degeneration of PD dopaminergic neurons.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative movement disorder. Whereas the majority of PD cases are sporadic, rare genetic defects have been linked to this prevalent movement disorder. Mutations in DJ-1 are associated with autosomal recessive early-onset PD. The exact biochemical function of DJ-1 has remained elusive. Here we report the generation of DJ-1 knockout (KO) mice by targeted deletion of exon 2 and exon 3. There is no observable degeneration of the central dopaminergic pathways, and the mice are anatomically and behaviorally similar to WT mice. Fluorescent Amplex red measurements of H(2)O(2) indicate that isolated mitochondria from young and old DJ-1 KO mice have a 2-fold increase in H(2)O(2). DJ-1 KO mice of 2-3 months of age have a 60% reduction in mitochondrial aconitase activity without compromising other mitochondrial processes. At an early age there are no differences in antioxidant enzymes, but in older mice there is an up-regulation of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase and a 2-fold increase in mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase activity. Mutational analysis and mass spectrometry reveal that DJ-1 is an atypical peroxiredoxin-like peroxidase that scavenges H(2)O(2) through oxidation of Cys-106. In vivo there is an increase of DJ-1 oxidized at Cys-106 after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine intoxication of WT mice. Taken together these data indicate that the DJ-1 KO mice have a deficit in scavenging mitochondrial H(2)O(2) due to the physiological function of DJ-1 as an atypical peroxiredoxin-like peroxidase.",

        "Title": "Two molecular pathways initiate mitochondria-dependent dopaminergic neurodegeneration in experimental Parkinson's disease.",
        "Abstract": "Dysfunction of mitochondrial complex I is associated with a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). In rodents, inhibition of complex I leads to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), as seen in PD, through activation of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic molecular pathways. In this scenario, complex I blockade increases the soluble pool of cytochrome c in the mitochondrial intermembrane space through oxidative mechanisms, whereas activation of pro-cell death protein Bax is actually necessary to trigger neuronal death by permeabilizing the outer mitochondrial membrane and releasing cytochrome c into the cytosol. Activation of Bax after complex I inhibition relies on its transcriptional induction and translocation to the mitochondria. How complex I deficiency leads to Bax activation is currently unknown. Using gene-targeted mice, we show that the tumor suppressor p53 mediates Bax transcriptional induction after PD-related complex I blockade in vivo, but it does not participate in Bax mitochondrial translocation in this model, either by a transcription-independent mechanism or through the induction of BH3-only proteins Puma or Noxa. Instead, Bax mitochondrial translocation in this model relies mainly on the JNK-dependent activation of the BH3-only protein Bim. Targeting either Bax transcriptional induction or Bax mitochondrial translocation results in a marked attenuation of SNpc dopaminergic cell death caused by complex I inhibition. These results provide further insight into the pathogenesis of PD neurodegeneration and identify molecular targets of potential therapeutic significance for this disabling neurological illness.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) cause a form of the fatal paralytic disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), presumably by a combination of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous processes. Here, we show that expression of mutated human SOD1 in primary mouse spinal motor neurons does not provoke motor neuron degeneration. Conversely, rodent astrocytes expressing mutated SOD1 kill spinal primary and embryonic mouse stem cell-derived motor neurons. This is triggered by soluble toxic factor(s) through a Bax-dependent mechanism. However, mutant astrocytes do not cause the death of spinal GABAergic or dorsal root ganglion neurons or of embryonic stem cell-derived interneurons. In contrast to astrocytes, fibroblasts, microglia, cortical neurons and myocytes expressing mutated SOD1 do not cause overt neurotoxicity. These findings indicate that astrocytes may play a role in the specific degeneration of spinal motor neurons in ALS. Identification of the astrocyte-derived soluble factor(s) may have far-reaching implications for ALS from both a pathogenic and therapeutic standpoint.",

Chromaffin cells isolated from transgenic mice that overexpress A30P alpha-synuclein displayed significantly increased cytosolic catecholamine levels as measured by intracellular patch electrochemistry, whereas cells overexpressing the WT protein and those from knock-out animals were not different from controls. Likewise, catechol concentrations were higher in L-DOPA-treated PC12 cells overexpressing A30P or A53T compared with those expressing WT alpha-synuclein, although the ability of cells to maintain a low cytosolic dopamine level after L-DOPA challenge was markedly inhibited by either protein. We also found that incubation with low-micromolar concentrations of WT, A30P, or A53T alpha-synuclein inhibited ATP-dependent maintenance of pH gradients in isolated chromaffin vesicles and that the WT protein was significantly less potent in inducing the proton leakage. In summary, we demonstrate that overexpression of different types of alpha-synuclein disrupts vesicular pH and leads to a marked increase in the levels of cytosolic catechol species, an effect that may in turn trigger cellular oxyradical damage. Although multiple molecular mechanisms may be responsible for the perturbation of cytosolic catecholamine homeostasis, this study provides critical evidence about how alpha-synuclein might exert its cytotoxicity and selectively damage catecholaminergic cells.",

        "Abstract": "ALS is a fatal paralytic disorder characterized by a progressive loss of spinal cord motor neurons. Herein, we show that NADPH oxidase, the main reactive oxygen species-producing enzyme during inflammation, is activated in spinal cords of ALS patients and in spinal cords in a genetic animal model of this disease. We demonstrate that inactivation of NADPH oxidase in ALS mice delays neurodegeneration and extends survival. We also show that NADPH oxidase-derived oxidant products damage proteins such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptors, which are located on motor neurons. Our in vivo and in vitro data indicate that such an oxidative modification hinders the IGF1/Akt survival pathway in motor neurons. These findings suggest a non-cell-autonomous mechanism through which inflammation could hasten motor neuron death and contribute to the selective motor neuronal degeneration in ALS.",

        "Abstract": "Intrastriatal injection of 3-nitrotyrosine, which is a biomarker for nitrating oxidants, provokes dopaminergic neuronal death in rats by unknown mechanisms. Herein, we show that extracellular 3-nitrotyrosine is transported via the l-aromatic amino acid transporter in nondopaminergic NT2 cells, whereas in dopaminergic PC12 cells, it is transported by both the l-aromatic amino acid and the dopamine transporters. In both cell lines, 3-nitrotyrosine is a substrate for tyrosine tubulin ligase, resulting in its incorporation into the C terminus of alpha-tubulin. In NT2 cells, incorporation of 3-nitrotyrosine into alpha-tubulin induces a progressive, reversible reorganization of the microtubule architecture. In PC12 cells, 3-nitrotyrosine decreases intracellular dopamine levels and is metabolized by the concerted action of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase and monoamine oxidase. Intracellular levels of 133 micromol of 3-nitrotyrosine per mole of tyrosine did not alter NT2 viability but induced PC12 apoptosis. The cell death was reversed by caspases and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. 3-Nitrotyrosine induced loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive primary rat neurons, which was also prevented by an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor. These findings provide a novel mechanism by which products generated by reactive nitrogen species induce dopaminergic neuron death and thus may contribute to the selective neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Mutation in superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), which is a cause of ALS, alters the folding patterns of this protein. Accumulation of misfolded mutant SOD1 might activate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways. Here we show that transgenic mice expressing ALS-linked SOD1 mutants exhibit molecular alterations indicative of a recruitment of ER's signaling machinery. We demonstrate by biochemical and morphological methods that mutant SOD1 accumulates inside the ER, where it forms insoluble high molecular weight species and interacts with the ER chaperone immunoglobulin-binding protein. These alterations are age- and region-specific, because they develop over the course of the disease and occur in the affected spinal cord but not in the nonaffected cerebellum in transgenic mutant SOD1 mice. Our results suggest a toxic mechanism for mutant SOD1 by which this ubiquitously expressed pathogenic protein could affect motor neuron survival and contribute to the selective motor neuronal degeneration in ALS.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that appears essentially as a sporadic condition. It results mainly from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. PD etiology remains mysterious, whereas its pathogenesis begins to be understood as a multifactorial cascade of deleterious factors. Most insights into PD pathogenesis come from investigations performed in experimental models of PD, especially those produced by neurotoxins. Although a host of natural and synthetic molecules do exert deleterious effects on dopaminergic neurons, only a handful are used in living laboratory animals to recapitulate some of the hallmarks of PD. In this review, we discuss what we believe are the four most popular parkinsonian neurotoxins, namely 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), rotenone, and paraquat. The main goal is to provide an updated summary of the main characteristics of each of these four neurotoxins. However, we also try to provide the reader with an idea about the various strengths and the weaknesses of these neurotoxic models.",

        "Abstract": "Dysfunction of mitochondrial complex I is a feature of human neurodegenerative diseases such as Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and Parkinson's disease. This mitochondrial defect is associated with a recruitment of the mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway in vivo. However, in isolated brain mitochondria, complex I dysfunction caused by either pharmacological or genetic means fails to directly activate this cell death pathway. Instead, deficits of complex I stimulate intramitochondrial oxidative stress, which, in turn, increase the releasable soluble pool of cytochrome c within the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Upon mitochondrial permeabilization by the cell death agonist Bax, more cytochrome c is released to the cytosol from brain mitochondria with impaired complex I activity. Given these results, we propose a model in which defects of complex I lower the threshold for activation of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis by Bax, thereby rendering compromised neurons more prone to degenerate. This molecular scenario may have far-reaching implications for the development of effective neuroprotective therapies for these incurable illnesses.",

        "Abstract": "The prion protein (PrP) is central to the prion diseases, although a role in other neurodegenerative diseases has been postulated. A common polymorphism (Met or Val) at codon 129 of the PrP gene (PRNP) features prominently in the risk and phenotype, of prion disease, and an abnormality in its distribution frequency may signal a role for PrP in other diseases. We conducted a case-control study to compare the PRNP codon 129 genotype distribution in Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and primary progressive aphasia (PPA), including 281 AD, 256 ALS, 39 PPA, and 415 healthy control subjects. Statistical analysis was applied to determine the presence or absence of disease-specific genotype associations. The distribution of codon 129 genotypes was similar among healthy control, AD, and ALS subjects, although the heterozygous state was significantly overrepresented (age-adjusted odds ratio, 8.47) in PPA, a rare condition of unknown cause. Although these findings do not entirely exclude a role for PrP in AD or ALS, they do not support the codon 129 genotype as a risk factor for either disease. However, the strong association between heterozygosity and PPA raises new questions about its cause and the role of PrP in other neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "Abstract": "How genetic and environmental factors interact in Parkinson disease is poorly understood. We have now compared the patterns of vulnerability and rescue of Caenorhabditis elegans with genetic modifications of three different genetic factors implicated in Parkinson disease (PD). We observed that expressing alpha-synuclein, deleting parkin (K08E3.7), or knocking down DJ-1 (B0432.2) or parkin produces similar patterns of pharmacological vulnerability and rescue. C. elegans lines with these genetic changes were more vulnerable than nontransgenic nematodes to mitochondrial complex I inhibitors, including rotenone, fenperoximate, pyridaben, or stigmatellin. In contrast, the genetic manipulations did not increase sensitivity to paraquat, sodium azide, divalent metal ions (Fe(II) or Cu(II)), or etoposide compared with the nontransgenic nematodes. Each of the PD-related lines was also partially rescued by the antioxidant probucol, the mitochondrial complex II activator, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate, or the anti-apoptotic bile acid tauroursodeoxycholic acid. Complete protection in all lines was achieved by combining d-beta-hydroxybutyrate with tauroursodeoxycholic acid but not with probucol. These results show that diverse PD-related genetic modifications disrupt the mitochondrial function in C. elegans, and they raise the possibility that mitochondrial disruption is a pathway shared in common by many types of familial PD.",

        "Abstract": "There is increasing evidence that neuron death in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, is due to the activation of programmed cell death. However, the upstream mediators of cell death remain largely unknown. One approach to the identification of upstream mediators is to perform gene expression analysis in disease models. Such analyses, performed in tissue culture models induced by neurotoxins, have identified up-regulation of CHOP/GADD153, a transcription factor implicated in apoptosis due to endoplasmic reticulum stress or oxidative injury. To evaluate the disease-related significance of these findings, we have examined the expression of CHOP/GADD153 in neurotoxin models of parkinsonism in living animals. Nuclear expression of CHOP protein is observed in developmental and adult models of dopamine neuron death induced by intrastriatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) and in models induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). CHOP is a mediator of neuron death in the adult 60HDA model because a null mutation results in a reduction in apoptosis. In the chronic MPTP model, however, while CHOP is robustly expressed, the null mutation does not protect from the loss of neurons. We conclude that the role of CHOP depends on the nature of the toxic stimulus. For 6OHDA, an oxidative metabolite of dopamine, it is a mediator of apoptotic death.",

Inflammatory oxidants have emerged as key contributors to PD- and MPTP-related neurodegeneration. Here, we show that myeloperoxidase (MPO), a key oxidant-producing enzyme during inflammation, is upregulated in the ventral midbrain of human PD and MPTP mice. We also show that ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons of mutant mice deficient in MPO are more resistant to MPTP-induced cytotoxicity than their wild-type littermates. Supporting the oxidative damaging role of MPO in this PD model are the demonstrations that MPO-specific biomarkers 3-chlorotyrosine and hypochlorous acid-modified proteins increase in the brains of MPTP-injected mice. This study demonstrates that MPO participates in the MPTP neurotoxic process and suggests that inhibitors of MPO may provide a protective benefit in PD.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease whose etiology and pathogenesis remain mainly unknown. To investigate its cause and, more particularly, its mechanism of neuronal death, numerous in vivo experimental models have been developed. Currently, both genetic and toxic models of PD are available, but the use of neurotoxins such as 6-hydroxydopamine, paraquat, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, and rotenone are still the most popular means for modeling the destruction of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons seen in PD. These four neurotoxins, although distinct in their intimate cytotoxic mechanisms, kill dopaminergic neurons via a cascade of deleterious events that consistently involves oxidative stress. Herein, we review and compare the molecular mechanisms of 6-hydroxydopamine, paraquat, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine, and rotenone, placing the emphasis of our discussion on how reactive oxygen and nitrogen species contribute to the neurotoxic properties of these four molecules. As the reader will discover, to achieve the above stated goal, we had to not only appraise recent findings, but also revisit earlier landmark studies to provide a comprehensive view on this topic. This approach also enabled us to describe how our understanding of the mechanism of actions of certain toxins has evolved over time, which is particularly striking in the case of the quatrogenarian neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily a sporadic condition which results mainly from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Its etiology remains enigmatic while its pathogenesis begins to be understood as a multifactorial cascade of deleterious factors. As of yet, most insights into PD pathogenesis are derived from toxic models of PD and show that the earlier cellular perturbations arising in dopaminergic neurons include oxidative stress and energy crisis. These alterations, rather than killing neurons, trigger subsequent death-related molecular pathways including elements of apoptosis. The fate of dopaminergic neurons in PD may also be influenced by additional factors such as excitotoxicity, emanating from the increased glutamatergic input from the subthalamic nucleus to the substantia nigra, and the glial response that arises in the striatum and the substantia nigra. In rare instances, PD can be familial, and those genetic forms have also provided clues to the pathogenesis of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron death including abnormalities in the mechanisms of protein folding and degradation as well as mitochondrial function. Although more remains to be elucidated about the pathogenic cascade in PD, the compilation of all of the aforementioned alterations starts to shed light on why and how nigral dopaminergic neurons may degenerate in this prominent disease, that is PD.",

Two recent publications of alpha-synuclein-duplication mutations show that the severity of familial Parkinsonian phenotype is dependent upon SNCA gene dosage and corresponding protein levels. Familial point mutations in SNCA were found to impair the efficient lysosomal degradation of alpha-synuclein, potentially resulting in elevated levels of alpha-synuclein. Conversely, the complete knockout of SNCA has little effect on transgenic mice. It is now clear that the regulation of alpha-synuclein levels has potential significance in the pathogenesis and treatment of sporadic PD.",

Experimental models of ALS such as the transgenic rodents expressing mutant superoxide dimutase-1 are playing a pivotal role in our understanding of ALS pathogenesis, and in our testing of new therapeutic interventions aimed at protecting against neurodegeneration. Apoptosis has emerged as a significant pathogenic factor in several neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. Constructed of multiple interacting molecules, the apoptosis machinery offers a host of attractive targets for pharmacological and genetic interventions to be tested in experimental models of ALS. Information generated by these pre-clinical studies holds the promise to provide sound scientific basis for the development of effective neuroprotective therapies for ALS.",

Here, we report that L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type II/amyloid binding alcohol dehydrogenase (HADH II/ABAD), a mitochondrial oxidoreductase enzyme involved in neuronal survival, is downregulated in PD patients and in MPTP-intoxicated mice. We also show that transgenic mice with increased expression of human HADH II/ABAD are significantly more resistant to MPTP than their wild-type littermates. This effect appears to be mediated by overexpression of HADH II/ABAD mitigating MPTP-induced impairment of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. This study demonstrates that HADH II/ABAD modulates MPTP neurotoxicity and suggests that HADH II/ABAD mimetics may provide protective benefit in the treatment of PD.",

        "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that apoptotic and inflammatory factors contribute to the demise of dopaminergic neurons. In this respect, Fas, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family with proapoptotic and inflammatory functions, was reported to be elevated within the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Accordingly, the present investigation evaluated the function of Fas in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of PD. Injection of MPTP increased nigral Fas expression, and mice lacking Fas displayed attenuated MPTP-induced SNc dopaminergic loss and microglial activation. In addition, Fas induction was blocked by expression of a dominant-negative c-Jun adenovirus that also protected dopamine neurons from MPTP-induced damage. Together, these data suggest the critical nature of the c-Jun-Fas signaling pathway in MPTP-induced neuronal loss. Although critical for degeneration of the soma, Fas deficiency did not significantly prevent the reduction of dopaminergic terminal fibers within the striatum or normalize the activation of striatal microglia and elevation of the postsynaptic activity marker DeltaFosB induced by denervation. Interestingly, Fas-deficient mice displayed a pre-existing reduction in striatal dopamine levels and locomotor behavior when compared with wild-type mice. Despite the reduced terminals, dopamine levels were not further suppressed by MPTP treatment in mutant mice, raising the possibility of a compensatory response in basal ganglia function in Fas-deficient mice.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopamine-containing neurons, but the molecular pathways underlying its pathogenesis remain uncertain. Here, we show that by eliminating c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) we can prevent neurodegeneration and improve motor function in an animal model of PD. First, we found that c-Jun is activated in dopaminergic neurons from PD patients and in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,4,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. Examination of various JNK-deficient mice shows that both JNK2 and JNK3, but not JNK1, are required for MPTP-induced c-Jun activation and dopaminergic cell demise. Furthermore, we have identified cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 as a molecular target of JNK activation and demonstrated that COX-2 is indispensable for MPTP-induced dopaminergic cell death. Our data revealed that JNK2- and JNK3-induced COX-2 may be a principle pathway responsible for neurodegeneration in PD.",

        "Abstract": "We investigated, in mice, the influence of life experience on the vulnerability to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a major neurotoxin that induces a Parkinson's disease-like syndrome in humans, and to cocaine, a potent psychostimulant that promotes drug addiction. Our findings show that adult C57BL/6 mice raised in an enriched environment (EE) for only 2 months are significantly more resistant to both drugs compared with mice raised in a standard environment (SE). Indeed, EE mice showed decreased locomotor activity in response to cocaine (10 and 20 mg/kg) as well as a different pattern of c-fos expression in the striatum compared with SE mice. After MPTP treatment, SE mice showed a 75% loss of dopamine neurons, whereas EE mice showed only a 40% loss. The dopamine transporter plays a key role in mediating the effects of both drugs. We thus investigated the regulation of its expression. EE mice showed less dopamine transporter binding in the striatum and less dopamine transporter mRNA per dopamine neuron at the cellular level as demonstrated by in situ hybridization. In addition, enriched environment promoted an increase in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the striatum. These data provide a direct demonstration of the beneficial consequences that a positive environment has in preventing neurodegeneration and in decreasing responsiveness to cocaine. Furthermore, they suggest that the probability of developing neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease or vulnerability to psychostimulants may be related to life experience.",

        "Abstract": "Caspases play an important role in neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD). Members of the Bcl-2 family are critical modulators of terminal cell death pathways. However, alterations of Bcl-2 family members and their functional role in an in vivo model of HD have not been documented. With the goal of gaining mechanistic insight, we used a transgenic mouse model of HD (R6/2) to investigate the chronology of caspase activation and functional alterations in members of the Bcl-2 family. In R6/2 mice caspase activation precedes proapoptotic changes in Bcl-2 family members. Of the caspases that we screened, caspase-1-like activation was the first to be detected in the disease process (7 weeks). Proapoptotic changes in members of the Bcl-2 family were first detected at 9 weeks. To demonstrate a potential functional/therapeutic role of Bcl-2 in HD, we crossed R6/2 mice with mice overexpressing Bcl-2 in neurons. Transgenic expression of Bcl-2 in R6/2 mice resulted in slight prolonged survival. Understanding the chronology of apoptotic events provides important information for appropriate therapeutic targeting in this devastating and untreatable disease.",

        "Abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs, cdks) may be inappropriately activated in several neurodegenerative conditions. Here, we report that cdk5 expression and activity are elevated after administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a toxin that damages the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. Supporting the pathogenic significance of the cdk5 alterations are the findings that the general cdk inhibitor, flavopiridol, or expression of dominant-negative cdk5, and to a lesser extent dominant-negative cdk2, attenuates the loss of dopaminergic neurons caused by MPTP. In addition, CDK inhibition strategies attenuate MPTP-induced hypolocomotion and markers of striatal function independent of striatal dopamine. We propose that cdk5 is a key regulator in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a loss of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons accompanied by a deficit in mitochondrial respiration. 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is a neurotoxin that causes dopaminergic neurodegeneration and a mitochondrial deficit reminiscent of PD. Here we show that the infusion of the ketone body d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DbetaHB) in mice confers partial protection against dopaminergic neurodegeneration and motor deficits induced by MPTP. These effects appear to be mediated by a complex II-dependent mechanism that leads to improved mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. Because of the safety record of ketone bodies in the treatment of epilepsy and their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, DbetaHB may be a novel neuroprotective therapy for PD.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) results primarily from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Current PD medications treat symptoms; none halt or retard dopaminergic neuron degeneration. The main obstacle to developing neuroprotective therapies is a limited understanding of the key molecular events that provoke neurodegeneration. The discovery of PD genes has led to the hypothesis that misfolding of proteins and dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway are pivotal to PD pathogenesis. Previously implicated culprits in PD neurodegeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, may also act in part by causing the accumulation of misfolded proteins, in addition to producing other deleterious events in dopaminergic neurons. Neurotoxin-based models (particularly MPTP) have been important in elucidating the molecular cascade of cell death in dopaminergic neurons. PD models based on the manipulation of PD genes should prove valuable in elucidating important aspects of the disease, such as selective vulnerability of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons to the degenerative process.",

Evidence for the participation of oxidative processes in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease have been obtained in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model by the use of genetically altered mice. MPTP administration has been shown to increase levels of superoxide both intracellularly, via the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and other mechanisms and extracellularly, via the activation of NADPH-oxidase in microglia. In addition to superoxide, nitric oxide production by nNOS or by microglial iNOS also contributes to the MPTP neurotoxocity. Mice with endowed defences against superoxide or with deficiency in the nNOS and iNOS are protected from MPTP toxicity suggesting that formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates both intracellularly and extracellularly contributes to the demise of dopaminergic neurons. Similar contribution of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species may well underlie the neurodegenerative processes in Parkinson's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Experimental models of dopaminergic neurodegeneration play a critical role in our quest to elucidate the cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the recent development of \"genetic models\" that have followed upon the discovery of mutations causing rare forms of familial PD, toxic models remain at the forefront when it comes to exploring the pathogenesis of sporadic PD. Among these, the model produced by the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) has a competitive advantage over all other toxic models because once this neurotoxin causes intoxication, it induces in humans a syndrome virtually identical to PD. For the past two decades, the complex pharmacology of MPTP and the key steps in the MPTP neurotoxic process have been identified. These molecular events can be classified into three groups: First, those implicated in the initiation of toxicity, which include energy failure due to ATP depletion and oxidative stress mediated by superoxide and nitric oxide; second, those recruited subsequently in response to the initial neuronal perturbations, which include elements of the molecular pathways of apoptosis such as Bax; and, third, those amplifying the neurodegenerative insult, which include various proinflammatory factors such as prostaglandins. Herein, these different contributing factors are reviewed, as is the sequence in which it is believed these factors are acting within the cascade of events responsible for the death of dopaminergic neurons in the MPTP model and in PD. How to target these factors to devise effective neuroprotective therapies for PD is also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "The molecular mechanisms mediating degeneration of midbrain dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) are poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence to support a role for the involvement of the calcium-dependent proteases, calpains, in the loss of dopamine neurons in a mouse model of PD. We show that administration of N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) evokes an increase in calpain-mediated proteolysis in nigral dopamine neurons in vivo. Inhibition of calpain proteolysis using either a calpain inhibitor (MDL-28170) or adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the endogenous calpain inhibitor protein, calpastatin, significantly attenuated MPTP-induced loss of nigral dopamine neurons. Commensurate with this neuroprotection, MPTP-induced locomotor deficits were abolished, and markers of striatal postsynaptic activity were normalized in calpain inhibitor-treated mice. However, behavioral improvements in MPTP-treated, calpain inhibited mice did not correlate with restored levels of striatal dopamine. These results suggest that protection against nigral neuron degeneration in PD may be sufficient to facilitate normalized locomotor activity without necessitating striatal reinnervation. Immunohistochemical analyses of postmortem midbrain tissues from human PD cases also displayed evidence of increased calpain-related proteolytic activity that was not evident in age-matched control subjects. Taken together, our findings provide a potentially novel correlation between calpain proteolytic activity in an MPTP model of PD and the etiology of neuronal loss in PD in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of uncertain pathogenesis characterized by a loss of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons, and can be modeled by the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Both inflammatory processes and oxidative stress may contribute to MPTP- and PD-related neurodegeneration. However, whether inflammation may cause oxidative damage in MPTP and PD is unknown. Here we show that NADPH-oxidase, the main reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing enzyme during inflammation, is up-regulated in SNpc of human PD and MPTP mice. These changes coincide with the local production of ROS, microglial activation, and DA neuronal loss seen after MPTP injections. Mutant mice defective in NADPH-oxidase exhibit less SNpc DA neuronal loss and protein oxidation than their WT littermates after MPTP injections. We show that extracellular ROS are a main determinant in inflammation-mediated DA neurotoxicity in the MPTP model of PD. This study supports a critical role for NADPH-oxidase in the pathogenesis of PD and suggests that targeting this enzyme or enhancing extracellular antioxidants may provide novel therapies for PD.",

Increased expression of cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) and production of prostaglandin E(2) have been implicated in neurodegeneration in several pathological settings. Here we show that COX-2, the rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin E(2) synthesis, is up-regulated in brain dopaminergic neurons of both PD and MPTP mice. COX-2 induction occurs through a JNKc-Jun-dependent mechanism after MPTP administration. We demonstrate that targeting COX-2 does not protect against MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration by mitigating inflammation. Instead, we provide evidence that COX-2 inhibition prevents the formation of the oxidant species dopamine-quinone, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. This study supports a critical role for COX-2 in both the pathogenesis and selectivity of the PD neurodegenerative process. Because of the safety record of the COX-2 inhibitors, and their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, these drugs may be therapies for PD.",

        "Abstract": "MPTP causes damage to substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons as seen in Parkinson's disease (PD). After sys-temic administration of MPTP, its active metabolite, MPP +, accumulates within SNpc DA neurons, where it inhibits ATP production and stim-ulates superoxide radical formation. The produced superoxide radicals react with nitric oxide (NO) to produce peroxynitrite, a highly reactive tissue-damaging species that damages proteins by oxidation and nitration. Only selected proteins appear nitrated, and among these, is found tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in DA synthesis. The process of nitration inactivates TH and, consequently dopamine pro-duction. Peroxynitrite also nicks DNA, which, in turn, activates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). PARP activation consumes ATP, and thus acutely depletes cell energy stores. This latter event aggravates the preexisting energy failure due to MPP + -induced mitochondrial respira-tion blockade and precipitates cell death. Altogether, these findings support the view that MPTP's deleterious cascade of events include mito-chondrial respiration deficit, oxidative stress, and energy failure. Because of the similarity between the MPTP mouse model and PD, it is tempting to propose that a similar scenario applies to the pathogenesis of PD.",

The loss of these neurons is associated with a glial response composed mainly of activated microglial cells and, to a lesser extent, of reactive astrocytes. This glial response may be the source of trophic factors and can protect against reactive oxygen species and glutamate. Alternatively, this glial response can also mediate a variety of deleterious events related to the production of pro-oxidant reactive species, and pro-inflammatory prostaglandin and cytokines. We discuss the potential protective and deleterious effects of glial cells in the SNpc of PD and examine how those factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease.",

Despite several genetic breakthroughs, the actual cause and mechanism of neurodegeneration in ALS remains a mystery. Nevertheless, recent scientific and clinical advances have led to the development of new therapeutic strategies for this progressive, fatal disorder. We review the progress of the most recent clinical trials in ALS, taking into account some of the hurdles encountered by these studies. We also discuss the potential role of retroviral infection as a cause or contributor to ALS, which is one of the most recent hypotheses for the pathogenesis of the disease. The genetic background of ALS is summarized and special attention is given to the newly identified ALS gene ALS2, and to those that are currently being investigated. The last part of this review is dedicated to the mutation in superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1). The hypothesized deleterious mechanisms of mutant SOD1 are discussed, as well as the possibilities that the mutant protein activates the apoptotic cell death process and that these molecular alterations can be exploited to devise experimental neuroprotective therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The loss of these neurons is associated with a glial response composed mainly of activated microglial cells and, to a lesser extent, of reactive astrocytes. This glial response may be the source of trophic factors and can protect against reactive oxygen species and glutamate. Alternatively, this glial response can also mediate a variety of deleterious events related to the production of pro-oxidant reactive species, proinflammatory prostaglandin, and cytokines. In this review, the authors discuss the potential protective and deleterious effects of glial cells in the SNpc of PD and examine how these factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease.",

        "Abstract": "The pathogenesis of cell death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may involve glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, oxidative damage, and apoptosis. We used a transgenic mouse model of ALS to determine the effect of inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 in treating the disease. Cyclooxygenase-2, present in spinal neurons and astrocytes, catalyzes the synthesis of prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin E2 stimulates glutamate release from astrocytes, whereas cyclooxygenase-2 also plays a key role in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and free radicals. Treatment with a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, markedly inhibited production of prostaglandin E2 in the spinal cords of ALS mice. Celecoxib treatment significantly delayed the onset of weakness and weight loss and prolonged survival by 25%. Spinal cords of treated ALS mice showed significant preservation of spinal neurons and diminished astrogliosis and microglial activation. Our results suggest that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition may benefit ALS patients.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is most commonly a sporadic illness, and is characterized by degeneration of substantia nigra dopamine (DA) neurons and abnormal cytoplasmic aggregates of alpha-synuclein. Rarely, PD may be caused by missense mutations in alpha-synuclein. MPTP, a neurotoxin that inhibits mitochondrial complex I, is a prototype for an environmental cause of PD because it produces a pattern of DA neurodegeneration that closely resembles the neuropathology of PD. Here we show that alpha-synuclein null mice display striking resistance to MPTP-induced degeneration of DA neurons and DA release, and this resistance appears to result from an inability of the toxin to inhibit complex I. Contrary to predictions from in vitro data, this resistance is not due to abnormalities of the DA transporter, which appears to function normally in alpha-synuclein null mice. Our results suggest that some genetic and environmental factors that increase susceptibility to PD may interact with a common molecular pathway, and represent the first demonstration that normal alpha-synuclein function may be important to DA neuron viability.",

        "Abstract": "Transgenic expression of mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) produces an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder. We have previously shown that the mitochondrial-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) pathway, including the redistribution of Bax, the cytosolic release of cytochrome c, and the activation of caspase-9, is recruited during neurodegeneration in spinal cords of transgenic mutant SOD1 mice. Herein, we show that the pro-PCD protein Bid is highly expressed in spinal cords of both wild-type and transgenic mutant SOD1 mice. While full-length Bid is found in the spinal cord of the two groups of mice, its cleaved form is only seen in transgenic mutant SOD1 mice, as early as the beginning of symptoms. In contrast, activated caspase-8, which is known to cleave Bid, is detected only at the end-stage of the disease. We also found that the expression of a dominant negative mutant of caspase-1 attenuates Bid cleavage as well as the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, and the ensuing activation of caspase-9 and -3 in spinal cords of transgenic mutant SOD1 mice. These findings suggest that Bid cleavage may occur in this model by a pathway other than caspase-8 and shed light onto the molecular correlates of the previously reported beneficial effect of caspase-1 inhibition in transgenic mutant SOD1 mice.",

        "Abstract": "Minocycline mediates neuroprotection in experimental models of neurodegeneration. It inhibits the activity of caspase-1, caspase-3, inducible form of nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Although minocycline does not directly inhibit these enzymes, the effects may result from interference with upstream mechanisms resulting in their secondary activation. Because the above-mentioned factors are important in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we tested minocycline in mice with ALS. Here we report that minocycline delays disease onset and extends survival in ALS mice. Given the broad efficacy of minocycline, understanding its mechanisms of action is of great importance. We find that minocycline inhibits mitochondrial permeability-transition-mediated cytochrome c release. Minocycline-mediated inhibition of cytochrome c release is demonstrated in vivo, in cells, and in isolated mitochondria. Understanding the mechanism of action of minocycline will assist in the development and testing of more powerful and effective analogues. Because of the safety record of minocycline, and its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, this drug may be a novel therapy for ALS.",

        "Abstract": "1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) damages the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway as seen in Parkinson's disease (PD), a common neurodegenerative disorder with no effective protective treatment. Consistent with a role of glial cells in PD neurodegeneration, here we show that minocycline, an approved tetracycline derivative that inhibits microglial activation independently of its antimicrobial properties, mitigates both the demise of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and the formation of nitrotyrosine produced by MPTP. In addition, we show that minocycline not only prevents MPTP-induced activation of microglia but also the formation of mature interleukin-1beta and the activation of NADPH-oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), three key microglial-derived cytotoxic mediators. Previously, we demonstrated that ablation of iNOS attenuates MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. Now, we demonstrate that iNOS is not the only microglial-related culprit implicated in MPTP-induced toxicity because mutant iNOS-deficient mice treated with minocycline are more resistant to this neurotoxin than iNOS-deficient mice not treated with minocycline. This study demonstrates that microglial-related inflammatory events play a significant role in the MPTP neurotoxic process and suggests that minocycline may be a valuable neuroprotective agent for the treatment of PD.",
