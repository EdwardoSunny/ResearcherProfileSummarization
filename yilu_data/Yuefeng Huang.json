        "Title": "An Improved Method for Detecting Crane Wheel-Rail Faults Based on YOLOv8 and the Swin Transformer.",
        "Abstract": "In the realm of special equipment, significant advancements have been achieved in fault detection. Nonetheless, faults originating in the equipment manifest with diverse morphological characteristics and varying scales. Certain faults necessitate the extrapolation from global information owing to their occurrence in localized areas. Simultaneously, the intricacies of the inspection area's background easily interfere with the intelligent detection processes. Hence, a refined YOLOv8 algorithm leveraging the Swin Transformer is proposed, tailored for detecting faults in special equipment. The Swin Transformer serves as the foundational network of the YOLOv8 framework, amplifying its capability to concentrate on comprehensive features during the feature extraction, crucial for fault analysis. A multi-head self-attention mechanism regulated by a sliding window is utilized to expand the observation window's scope. Moreover, an asymptotic feature pyramid network is introduced to augment spatial feature extraction for smaller targets. Within this network architecture, adjacent low-level features are merged, while high-level features are gradually integrated into the fusion process. This prevents loss or degradation of feature information during transmission and interaction, enabling accurate localization of smaller targets. Drawing from wheel-rail faults of lifting equipment as an illustration, the proposed method is employed to diagnose an expanded fault dataset generated through transfer learning. Experimental findings substantiate that the proposed method in adeptly addressing numerous challenges encountered in the intelligent fault detection of special equipment. Moreover, it outperforms mainstream target detection models, achieving real-time detection capabilities.",

        "Title": "ILC2s navigate tissue redistribution during infection using stage-specific S1P receptors.",
        "Abstract": "Lymphocytes can circulate as well as take residence within tissues. While the mechanisms by which circulating populations are recruited to infection sites have been extensively characterized, the molecular basis for the recirculation of tissue-resident cells is less understood. Here, we show that helminth infection- or IL-25-induced redistribution of intestinal group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) requires access to the lymphatic vessel network. Although the secondary lymphoid structure is an essential signal hub for adaptive lymphocyte differentiation and dispatch, it is redundant for ILC2 migration and effector function. Upon IL-25 stimulation, a dramatic change in epigenetic landscape occurs in intestinal ILC2s, leading to the expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs). Among the various S1PRs, we found that S1PR5 is critical for ILC2 exit from intestinal tissue to lymph. By contrast, S1PR1 plays a dominant role in ILC2 egress from mesenteric lymph nodes to blood circulation and then to distal tissues including the lung where the redistributed ILC2s contribute to tissue repair. The requirement of two S1PRs for ILC2 migration is largely due to the dynamic expression of the tissue-retention marker CD69, which mediates S1PR1 internalization. Thus, our study demonstrates a stage-specific requirement of different S1P receptors for ILC2 redistribution during infection. We therefore propose a fundamental paradigm that innate and adaptive lymphocytes utilize a shared vascular network frame and specialized navigation cues for migration.",

        "Abstract": "Opioid use disorders cause major morbidity and mortality, and there is a pressing need for novel mechanistic targets and biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. Exposure to mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists causes changes in cytokine and inflammatory protein networks in peripheral blood, and also in brain glia and neurons. Individuals with heroin use disorder (iHUD) show dysregulated levels of several cytokines in blood. However, there is limited data on a comprehensive panel of such markers in iHUD versus healthy controls (HC), especially as a multi-target biomarker. We used a validated proximity extension assay for relative quantification of 92 cytokines and inflammatory proteins in serum of iHUD on medication assisted therapy (MAT; n=21), versus HC (n=24). Twenty-nine targets showed significant group differences (primarily iHUD>HC), surviving multiple comparison correction (p=0.05). This included 19 members of canonical cytokine families, including specific chemokines, interleukins, growth factors, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related proteins. For dimensionality reduction, data from these 19 cytokines were entered into a principal component (PC) analysis, and PC1 scores were iHUD>HC (p<0.0001). A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis yielded an AUROC=91.7% (p<0.0001). This PC1 score remained a positive predictor of being in the HUD group in a multivariable logistic regression, which included demographic/clinical variables. Overall, this study shows a panel of cytokines that differ significantly between iHUD and HC, and provides a multi-target \"cytokine biomarker score\" for potential diagnostic purposes, and examination of disease severity.",

        "Abstract": "As an emerging fluorophore, aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) have received widespread attention in recent years, but the inherent drawbacks of AIEgens, such as the poor water-solubility and insufficient fluorescence stability in complex environments, restrict their performance in practical applications. Herein, we report a universal strategy based on hydrophobic dendritic mesoporous silica (HMSN) that can integrate different AIE molecules to construct multi-color fluorescent AIE materials. Specifically, HMSN with central radial pores was used as a powerful carrier for direct loading AIE molecules and restricting their intramolecular motions. Due to the pore-domain restriction effect and hydrophobic interaction, the obtained silica-based AIE materials have bright fluorescence with a maximum quantum yield of 68.38%, high colloidal/fluorescence stability, and excellent biosafety. Further, these silica-based AIE materials can be conjugated with functional antibodies to obtain probes with different targetability. After integration with immunomagnetic beads, the prepared detection probes achieved the quantitative detection of cardiac troponin I with the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.508\u00a0ng/mL. Overall, the targeting probes stemming from silica-based AIE materials can not only achieve cell-specific imaging, but quantify the number of Jurkat cells (LOD\u00a0=\u00a0270 cells/mL) to further determine the specific etiology of the disease.",

        "Abstract": "Recent research emphasizes the growing importance of starch-lipid complexes due to their anti-digestibility ability, prompting a need to explore the impact of different starch sources and preparation methods on their properties. In this study, starch-palmitic acid (PA) complexes were prepared by three different starches including Tartary buckwheat starch (TBS), potato starch (PTS), and pea starch (PS) by heating treatment (HT) and autoclaving treatment (AT), respectively, and their physicochemical property and in vitro digestibility were systematically compared. The formation of the starch-PA complex was confirmed through various characterization techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Among the complexes, the PTS-PA complex exhibited the highest complexation index over 80\u00a0%, while the PS-PA complex had the lowest rapid digestible starch content (56.49-59.42\u00a0%). Additionally, the complexes prepared by AT exhibited higher resistant starch content (41.95-32.46\u00a0%) than those prepared by HT (31.42-32.49\u00a0%), while the complexes prepared by HT held better freeze-thaw stability and hydration ability than those prepared by AT. This study highlights the important role of starch sources in the physicochemical and digestibility properties of starch-lipid complex and the potential application of AT in the preparation of novel resistant starch.",

        "Abstract": "Movies captivate groups of individuals (the audience), especially if they contain themes of common motivational interest to the group. In drug addiction, a key mechanism is maladaptive motivational salience attribution whereby drug cues outcompete other reinforcers within the same environment or context. We predicted that while watching a drug-themed movie, where cues for drugs and other stimuli share a continuous narrative context, fMRI responses in individuals with heroin use disorder (iHUD) will preferentially synchronize during drug scenes. Results revealed such drug-biased synchronization in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventromedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and insula. After 15 weeks of inpatient treatment, there was a significant reduction in this drug-biased shared response in the OFC, which correlated with a concomitant reduction in dynamically-measured craving, suggesting synchronized OFC responses to a drug-themed movie as a neural marker of craving and recovery in iHUD.",

        "Abstract": "Traditional wood adhesives have the problems of excessive dependence on fossil resources and environmental pollution. Cellulose, a renewable biomass resource with a low price and huge output, provides a basis for preparing biomass wood adhesives. In this study, a new type of polyamide resin was prepared by modifying microcrystalline cellulose and reacting with natural citric acid. Specifically, toluenesulfonyl cellulose (TS) was synthesized, and functional amino cellulose (AC) was prepared by a nucleophilic substitution reaction with hyperbranched polyamide (HP). Then cellulose-based hyperbranched polyamide resin (CHP) was prepared by polycondensation with citric acid. The structure of CHP resin was investigated by FTIR, XPS, ",

        "Title": "Overdose mortality rates for opioids and stimulant drugs are substantially higher in men than in women: state-level analysis.",
        "Abstract": "Drug overdoses from opioids and stimulants are a major cause of mortality in the United States. It is unclear if there are stable sex differences in overdose mortality for these drugs across states, whether these differ across the lifespan, and if so, whether they can be accounted for by different levels of drug misuse. This was a state-level analysis of epidemiological data on overdose mortality, across 10-year age bins (age range: 15-74), using the CDC WONDER platform for decedents in the United States in 2020-1. The outcome measure was rate of overdose death (per 100,000) for: synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl), heroin, psychostimulants with potential for misuse (e.g., methamphetamine), and cocaine. Multiple linear regressions controlled for ethnic-cultural background, household net worth, and sex-specific rate of misuse (from NSDUH, 2018-9). For all these drug categories, males had greater overall overdose mortality than females, after controlling for rates of drug misuse. The mean male/female sex ratio of mortality rate was relatively stable across jurisdictions: synthetic opioids (2.5 [95% CI, 2.4-7]), heroin, (2.9 [95% CI, 2.7-3.1], psychostimulants (2.4 [95% CI, 2.3-5]), and cocaine (2.8 [95% CI, 2.6-9]). With data stratified in 10-year age bins, the sex difference generally survived adjustment (especially in the 25-64 age range). Results indicate that males are significantly more vulnerable than females to overdose deaths caused by opioid and stimulant drugs, taking into account differing state-level environmental conditions and drug misuse levels. These results call for research into diverse biological, behavioral, and social factors that underlie sex differences in human vulnerability to drug overdose.",

        "Abstract": "Most memories that are formed are forgotten, while others are retained longer and are subject to memory stabilization. We show that non-invasive transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the greater occipital nerve (NITESGON) using direct current during learning elicited a long-term memory effect. However, it did not trigger an immediate effect on learning. A neurobiological model of long-term memory proposes a mechanism by which memories that are initially unstable can be strengthened through subsequent novel experiences. In a series of studies, we demonstrate NITESGON's capability to boost the retention of memories when applied shortly before, during, or shortly after the time of learning by enhancing memory consolidation via activation and communication in and between the locus coeruleus pathway and hippocampus by plausibly modulating dopaminergic input. These findings may have a significant impact for neurocognitive disorders that inhibit memory consolidation such as Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Starch-phenolics complex generated by the interaction between starch and phenolic acids had improved characteristics than the native starch, but the efficient preparation of such complex is still challenging. In this study, we proposed a new method for the preparation of starch-phenolics complexes under the pretreatment of electron beam irradiation (EBI). Four structurally similar monomeric phenolic acids including gallic acid (GA), 3,4-Dihydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid (3MGA), syringic acid (SA) and vanillic acid (VA), which naturally existed in Tartary buckwheat (TB) seeds, were complexed with native and EBI-pretreated TB starch. The results showed that the complexation between starch and 3MGA was the strongest, more than 30\u00a0mg of 3MGA was complexed with 1\u00a0g of starch. The complexation did not affect the particle morphology and A-type structure of starch, but changed the crystal structure order and promoted the strength of hydrogen bond, which may lead to the formation of granular complex. EBI pretreatment can significantly promote the complexation by enhancing hydrogen bonds as indicated by a broader band at 3500 \u223c 3100\u00a0cm",

        "Abstract": "Different drugs of abuse impact the morphology of fronto-striatal dopaminergic targets in both common and unique ways. While dorsal striatal volume tracks with addiction severity across drug classes, opiates impact ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) neuroplasticity in preclinical models, and psychostimulants alter inhibitory control, rooted in cortical regions such as the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). We hypothesized parallel grey matter volume changes associated with human heroin or cocaine use disorder: lower grey matter volume of vmPFC/NAcc in heroin use disorder and IFG in cocaine use disorder, and putamen grey matter volume to be associated with addiction severity measures (including craving) across both. In this cross-sectional study, we quantified grey matter volume (P < 0.05-corrected) in age/sex/IQ-matched individuals with heroin use disorder (n = 32, seven females), cocaine use disorder (n = 32, six females) and healthy controls (n = 32, six females) and compared fronto-striatal volume between groups using voxel-wise general linear models and non-parametric permutation-based tests. Overall, individuals with heroin use disorder had smaller vmPFC and NAcc/putamen volumes than healthy controls. Bilateral lower IFG grey matter volume patterns were specifically evident in cocaine versus heroin use disorders. Correlations between addiction severity measures and putamen grey matter volume did not reach nominal significance level in this sample. These results indicate alterations in dopamine-innervated regions (in the vmPFC and NAcc) in heroin addiction. For the first time we demonstrate lower IFG grey matter volume specifically in cocaine compared with heroin use disorder, suggesting a signature of reduced inhibitory control, which remains to be tested directly using select behavioural measures. Overall, results suggest substance-specific volumetric changes in human psychostimulant or opiate addiction, with implications for fine-tuning biomarker and treatment identification by primary drug of abuse.",

        "Abstract": "Lignocellulose multi-component films were fabricated using cellulose nanofiber (CNF), konjac glucomannan (KGM), and alkali lignin (AL). Covalent bonds among these three lignocellulose components were constructed with epichlorohydrin (EPI) to achieve chemical cross-linking, which inspired by lignin-carbohydrate complex (LCC) bonds in natural wood. Chemical cross-linking enhanced the mechanical properties of the composite films, the tensile stress reached to 110.47\u00a0MPa and the tensile strain reached to 8.27%. The presence of hemicellulose and lignin in composite films contributed to the functionalities of the films. The composite film with 20\u00a0wt% AL blocked over 99% of both UVA and UVB, the water contact angle reached 110.38\u00b0, and no obvious swelling behavior was observed after soaking in water for 180\u00a0days. Composite films with strong water-resistance and UV-blocking have great potential for the related application.",

        "Abstract": "Peripheral serotonin (5-HT) is mainly generated from the gastrointestinal tract and taken up and stored by platelets in the circulation. Although the gut is recognized as a major immune organ, how intestinal local immune responses control whole-body physiology via 5-HT remains unclear. Here, we show that intestinal inflammation enhances systemic platelet activation and blood coagulation. Intestinal epithelium damage induces elevated levels of the alarm cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33), leading to platelet activation via promotion of gut-derived 5-HT release. More importantly, we found that loss of intestinal epithelial-derived IL-33 lowers peripheral 5-HT levels, resulting in compromised platelet activation and hemostasis. Functionally, intestinal IL-33 contributes to the recruitment of neutrophils to sites of acute inflammation by enhancing platelet activities. Genetic deletion of intestinal IL-33 or neutralization of peripheral IL-33 protects animals from lipopolysaccharide endotoxic shock through attenuated neutrophil extravasation. Therefore, our data establish a distinct role of intestinal IL-33 in activating platelets by promoting 5-HT release for systemic physiology and inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "The gastrointestinal tract is known as the largest endocrine organ that encounters and integrates various immune stimulations and neuronal responses due to constant environmental challenges. Enterochromaffin (EC) cells, which function as chemosensors on the gut epithelium, are known to translate environmental cues into serotonin (5-HT) production, contributing to intestinal physiology. However, how immune signals participate in gut sensation and neuroendocrine response remains unclear. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) acts as an alarmin cytokine by alerting the system of potential environmental stresses. We here demonstrate that IL-33 induced instantaneous peristaltic movement and facilitated Trichuris muris expulsion. We found that IL-33 could be sensed by EC cells, inducing release of 5-HT. IL-33-mediated 5-HT release activated enteric neurons, subsequently promoting gut motility. Mechanistically, IL-33 triggered calcium influx via a non-canonical\u00a0signaling pathway specifically in EC cells to induce 5-HT secretion. Our data establish an immune-neuroendocrine axis in calibrating rapid 5-HT release for intestinal homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "An ongoing debate surrounding transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the scalp is whether it modulates brain activity both directly and in a regionally constrained manner enough to positively affect symptoms in patients with neurological disorders. One alternative explanation is that direct current stimulation affects neural circuits mainly indirectly, i.e., via peripheral nerves. Here, we report that noninvasive direct current stimulation indirectly affects neural circuits via peripheral nerves. In a series of studies, we show that direct current stimulation can cause activation of the greater occipital nerve (ON-tDCS) and augments memory via the ascending fibers of the occipital nerve to the locus coeruleus, promoting noradrenaline release. This noradrenergic pathway plays a key role in driving hippocampal activity by modifying functional connectivity supporting the consolidation of a memory event.",

        "Abstract": "Innate lymphocytes maintain tissue homeostasis at mucosal barriers, with group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) producing type 2 cytokines and controlling helminth infection. While the molecular understanding of ILC2 responses has advanced, the complexity of microenvironmental factors impacting ILC2s is becoming increasingly apparent. Herein, we used single-cell analysis to explore the diversity of gene expression among lung lymphocytes during helminth infection. Following infection, we identified a subset of ILC2s that preferentially expressed Il5-encoding interleukin (IL)-5, together with Calca-encoding calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its cognate receptor components. CGRP in concert with IL-33 and neuromedin U (NMU) supported IL-5 but constrained IL-13 expression and ILC2 proliferation. Without CGRP signaling, ILC2 responses and worm expulsion were enhanced. Collectively, these data point to CGRP as a context-dependent negative regulatory factor that shapes innate lymphocyte responses to alarmins and neuropeptides during type 2 innate immune responses.",

        "Abstract": "The effects of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma treatment on physicochemical and digestion properties of Tartary buckwheat (TBS), sorghum (SS), wheat (WS) and quinoa (QS) starches were investigated. Plasma treatment resulted in higher solubility and lower swelling capacity of the starch samples studied. Through XRD and FTIR analyses, the relative crystallinity of starch was increased by DBD plasma, while the crystalline type remained unchanged. It was observed from SEM that more fissures and holes appeared for TBS and SS granules, and granule aggregation occurred for WS and QS caused by plasma treatment, both of which made digestion enzymes more accessible to the four starches. In addition, a marked increase in gelatinization temperature and significant reduction in viscosity of plasma treated starches were found. Interestingly, the increased enzyme accessibility and decreased viscosity of starch were consistent with the enhanced starch digestibility that was suggested by the increased RDS content, digestion rate and digestion velocity constant. Therefore, the DBD plasma treatment on starch may be not in favor of postprandial blood sugar control, but it is suggested to be applied in some industrial processes that need acceleration in starch hydrolyzation, such as bioethanol production, brewing and food fermentation.",

        "Title": "ILC2s - resident lymphocytes pre-adapted to a specific tissue or migratory effectors that adapt to where they move?",
        "Abstract": "A cardinal feature of the T-cell adaptive immune system is the antigen-dependent activation of na\u00efve T cells in secondary lymphoid sites, followed by the migration of the resultant effector cells through the efferent lymph to the blood and then into a peripheral tissue site of infection or tumor growth. In contrast, the current view of innate lymphocytes (ILCs), the innate counterparts of T cells, is that they are tissue-resident cells, adapted to their specific environments during development and performing their effector functions locally upon cytokine stimulation. Here we present recent findings that challenge the latter as defining the properties of ILCs, at least ILC2s. Our studies show that IL-25, administrated experimentally or generated in response to helminth infection, triggers local proliferation and activation of intestinal ILC2s that are the precursors to inflammatory ILC2 (iILC2) cells. These cells downregulate CD69 expression, upregulate S1P receptors and move across the villus lymphatic endothelium in an S1P-depndent manner. They subsequently enter the blood stream, through which they traffic to distant organs such as the liver and lung. In the lung, these iILC2 cells play a crucial role in host defense during the pulmonary stage of helminth infection. In the later stage of infection, a fraction of the iILC2 cells phenotypically convert into lung-resident natural ILC2 (nILC2)-like cells while another fraction homes back to their original location in the small intestine. These data support the view that ILC2s possess properties considered characteristic of adaptive T lymphocytes, namely local activation and distant effector function, but in response to alarm cytokines instead of specific antigen. These findings also raise questions about whether other ILC subsets show similar trafficking potential when suitably challenged, the extent to which such cells show plasticity in adapting to new tissue environments beyond the course of early development, and the relative roles of organ-resident versus migratory ILCs in host defense.",

        "Abstract": "The posteromedial cortex (PMC)-comprising posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and the precuneus (PrC)-is perhaps best known for its involvement in the default mode network. There is no consensus regarding the specific functions of PMC, however, and its component regions each exhibit distinct, but partially overlapping functional profiles. To date, there has been minimal effort to disentangle the functions of these regions. In the present study, we use Neurosynth ( http://neurosynth.org ) to conduct an unbiased meta-analysis of the PMC based on fMRI coactivation and semantic information extracted from 11,406 studies. Our analyses revealed six PMC clusters with distinct functional profiles: superior and inferior dorsal PCC, anterior and posterior PrC, ventral PCC, and RSC. We discuss these findings in the context of the existing literature and suggest several fruitful avenues for continued research.",

        "Abstract": "The thickness of graphene films can be accurately determined by optical contrast spectroscopy. However, this becomes challenging and complicated when the flake size reduces to the micrometer scale, where the contrast spectrum is sensitively dependent on the polarization and incident angle of light. Here, we report accurate measurement of the optical contrast spectra of micrometer-sized few-layer graphene flakes on Au substrate. Using a high-resolution optical microscopy with a 100\u00d7 magnification objective, we accurately determined the layer numbers of flakes as small as one micrometer in lateral size. We developed a theoretical model to accurately take into account the appropriate contribution of light incident at various angles and polarizations, which matched the experimental results extremely well. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the optical contrast spectroscopy is highly sensitive to detect the adsorption of submonolayer airborne hydrocarbon molecules, which can reveal whether graphene is contaminated. Though the technique was demonstrated on graphene, it can be readily generalized to many other two-dimensional materials, which opens new avenues for developing miniaturized and ultrasensitive label-free molecular sensors.",

Normally, the gut microbiota matures during ontogeny to a state of balanced commensalism marked by the absence of adverse inflammation. Subsets of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and conventional T cells are considered to have redundant functions in containment and clearance of microbial pathogens, but how these two major lymphoid-cell populations each contribute to shaping the mature commensal microbiome and help to maintain tissue homeostasis has not been determined.

        "Title": "The neural correlates of the unified percept of alcohol-related craving: a fMRI and EEG study.",
        "Abstract": "Alcohol addiction is accompanied by aberrant neural activity. Previously, task-based fMRI and resting-state EEG studies have revealed that craving, a critical component of addiction, is linked to abnormal activity in cortical regions including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), etc. In this study, we combine these two imaging techniques to investigate a group of alcohol-addicted patients and provide convergent evidence for the neural correlates of craving not only in alcohol but substance abuse in general. We observe abnormal BOLD signal levels in the dACC, NAcc, pgACC, PCC, amygdala, and parahippocampus (PHC) in a cue-reactivity fMRI experiment. These findings are consistent with increased beta-band activity in the dACC and pgACC in resting-state EEG. We further observe desynchronization characterized by decreased functional connectivity in cue-based fMRI and hypersynchronization characterized by increased functional connectivity between these regions in the theta frequency band. The results of our study show a consistent pattern of alcohol craving elicited by external cues and internal desires. Given the advantage of superior spatial and temporal resolution, we hypothesize a \"central craving network\" that integrates the different aspects of alcohol addiction into a unified percept.",

        "Abstract": "Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are innate counterparts of adaptive T lymphocytes, contributing to host defense, tissue repair, metabolic homeostasis, and inflammatory diseases. ILCs have been considered to be tissue-resident cells, but whether ILCs move between tissue sites during infection has been unclear. We show here that interleukin-25- or helminth-induced inflammatory ILC2s are circulating cells that arise from resting ILC2s residing in intestinal lamina propria. They migrate to diverse tissues based on sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)-mediated chemotaxis that promotes lymphatic entry, blood circulation, and accumulation in peripheral sites, including the lung, where they contribute to anti-helminth defense and tissue repair. This ILC2 expansion and migration is a behavioral parallel to the antigen-driven proliferation and migration of adaptive lymphocytes to effector sites and indicates that ILCs complement adaptive immunity by providing both local and distant tissue protection during infection.",

This innate response is dependent on IL-33 but not T cell antigen receptors (TCRs). While type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2 cells) are the dominant innate producers of IL-13 in naive mice, we found here that helminth-infected mice had more TH2 cells compared to uninfected mice, and thes e cells became major mediators of innate type 2 responses. TH2 cells made important contributions to HDM-induced antigen-nonspecific eosinophilic inflammation and protected mice recovering from infection with Ascaris suum against subsequent infection with the phylogenetically distant nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for effector TH2 cells during TCR-independent innate-like immune responses.",

        "Abstract": "Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2 cells) are able to produce type 2 cytokines and to mediate type 2 immune protection and tissue homeostasis. ILC2 cells have often been considered to be a single set of cells that respond to IL-33 and/or IL-25. Recent evidence now indicates that ILC2 cells can be grouped into two distinct subsets: homeostatic or natural ILC2s (nILC2 cells); and inflammatory ILC2 cells (iILC2 cells). nILC2 cells reside in barrier tissues and primarily respond to IL-33. They play critical roles not only in immune protection but also in tissue repair and beige fat biogenesis. iILC2 cells are not present in peripheral tissues in the steady state but can be elicited at many sites by helminth infection or IL-25 treatment. IL-25-elicited ilLC2 cells act as transient ILC progenitors with multipotency. They can be mobilized by distinct types of infections to develop into nILC2-like or ILC3-like cells, functioning in corresponding immune responses. The demonstration of the existence of iILC2 cells adds to our understanding of the complexity of ILC2 biology and makes necessary an analysis of the relationship between nILC2 cells and iILC2 cells.",

        "Abstract": "Angiogenesis is spatially and temporally orchestrated by a myriad of signaling pathways, including the Notch signaling pathway. Here, we identified UXT as an evolutionarily conserved and developmentally expressed protein, indispensable for intersegmental vessel (ISV) formation in zebrafish. Deficiency of UXT in zebrafish embryos results in shorter ISVs, loss of tip cell behavior, and impairment of endothelial cell migration and division. Significantly, UXT attenuates the expression of the Notch-responsive genes in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, UXT binds to the promoters of the Notch signaling target genes and specifically interacts with the transactivation region domain of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), impairing the interaction between NICD and the transcription factor RBP-J\u03ba endogenously. This prevents RBP-J\u03ba/CSL from activation and thus inhibits the consequent gene inductions. Furthermore, blockade of Notch signaling rescues the angiogenesis defect caused by UXT knockdown both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, the data presented in this study characterize UXT as a novel repressor of Notch signaling, shedding new light on the molecular regulation of angiogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Virus infection triggers immediate innate immune responses. Apoptosis represents another effective means to restrict virus invasion, besides robust expression of host cytokines and chemokines. IRF3 was recently demonstrated to be indispensable for Sendai virus (SeV)-induced apoptosis, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Here we report that a dynamic protein complex, Tom70/Hsp90/IRF3/Bax, mediates SeV-induced apoptosis. The cytosolic proapoptotic protein Bax interacts specifically with IRF3 upon virus infection. The mitochondrial outer membrane protein Tom70 recruits IRF3 to mitochondria via Hsp90. Consequently, the relocation of Bax onto mitochondria induces the leakage of cytochrome c into the cytosol and initiates the corresponding apoptosis. Interestingly, IKK-i is essential for this apoptosis, whereas TBK1 is dispensable. Collectively, our study characterizes a novel protein complex that is important for SeV-induced apoptosis.",

Among these, type 2 ILCs (ILC2 cells) are able to produce type 2 cytokines. We report the existence of an inflammatory ILC2 (iILC2) population responsive to interleukin 25 (IL-25) that complemented IL-33-responsive natural ILC2 (nILC2) cells. iILC2 cells developed into nILC2-like cells in vitro and in vivo and contributed to the expulsion of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. They also acquired IL-17-producing ability and provided partial protection against Candida albicans. We propose that iILC2 cells are transient progenitors of ILCs mobilized by inflammation and infection that develop into nILC2-like cells or ILC3-like cells and contribute to immunity to both helminths and fungi.",

However, the underlying mechanisms of this process are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS/VISA/Cardif/IPS-1) is critical for SeV (Sendai virus)-induced apoptosis. MAVS specifically activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) but not other MAP kinases. Jnk2-/- cells, but not Jnk1-/- cells, are unable to initiate virus-induced apoptosis and SeV further fails to trigger apoptosis in MAPK kinase 7 (MKK7) knockout (Mkk7-/-) cells. Mechanistically, MAVS recruits MKK7 onto mitochondria via its 3D domain, which subsequently phosphorylates JNK2 and thus activates the apoptosis pathway. Consistently, Jnk2-/- mice, but not Jnk1-/- mice, display marked inflammatory injury in lung and liver after viral challenge. Collectively, we have identified a novel signaling pathway, involving MAVS-MKK7-JNK2, which mediates virus-induced apoptosis and highlights the indispensable role of mitochondrial outer membrane in host defenses.",

        "Abstract": "Virus infection induces the MAVS-TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) 3 signaling axis on mitochondria. It remains to elucidate the corresponding regulatory processes. In this study, we identify UXT-V1 as a novel TRAF3-binding protein. UXT-V1 is critical for the virus-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and IFN regulatory factor 3. Reduction of UXT-V1 impairs the induction of IFN-\u03b2 and attenuates the host antiviral responses. The N-terminal TRAF-binding motif of UXT-V1 binds to the C-terminal TRAF domain of TRAF3, thus facilitating the interaction between TRAF3 and MAVS. Notably, TRAF3 and TNFR-associated death domain protein are recruited onto mitochondria upon virus infection. These translocations are blocked when knocking down UXT-V1. Thus, UXT-V1 represents a novel integral component of the MAVS signalosome on mitochondria, mediating the innate antiviral signal transduction.",

        "Abstract": "Proteins that directly regulate tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling have critical roles in determining cell death and survival. Previously we characterized ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT)-V2 as a novel transcriptional cofactor to regulate nuclear factor-\u03baB in the nucleus. Here we report that another splicing isoform of UXT, UXT-V1, localizes in cytoplasm and regulates TNF-induced apoptosis. UXT-V1 knockdown cells are hypersensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis. We demonstrated that UXT-V1 is a new component of TNF receptor signaling complex. We found that UXT-V1 binds to TNF receptor-associated factor 2 and prevents TNF receptor-associated death domain protein from recruiting Fas-associated protein with death domain. More importantly, UXT-V1 is a short-half-life protein, the degradation of which facilitates the formation of the apoptotic receptor complex II in response to TNF treatment. This study demonstrates that UXT-V1 is a novel regulator of TNF-induced apoptosis and sheds new light on the underlying molecular mechanism of this process.",

        "Abstract": "NF-\u03baB is a family of important transcription factors that modulate immunity, development, inflammation, and cancer. The biological activity of NF-\u03baB is subjected to various spatial and temporal regulations. Bioinformatics analysis predicts that CITED2 is topologically close to NF-\u03baB in the protein interaction networks. In this study, we show that ectopic expression or knockdown of CITED2 attenuates or potentiates, respectively, the expression of NF-\u03baB-responsive genes. Mechanistically, CITED2 constitutively localizes inside the nucleus and interacts specifically with the coactivator p300. This prevents p65 from binding to p300, impairs p65 acetylation, and attenuates p65 binding to its cognate promoters. Furthermore, LPS induces CITED2 expression via NF-\u03baB in macrophages. CITED2 sensitizes cells to TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis. Collectively, this study identifies CITED2 as a novel regulator of NF-\u03baB in the nucleus, which reveals a negative feedback mechanism for NF-\u03baB signaling.",
