        "Abstract": "In 2011, the UK medical research charity Cure Parkinson's set up the international Linked Clinical Trials (iLCT) committee to help expedite the clinical testing of potentially disease modifying therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD). The first committee meeting was held at the Van Andel Institute in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 2012. This group of PD experts has subsequently met annually to assess and prioritize agents that may slow the progression of this neurodegenerative condition, using a systematic approach based on preclinical, epidemiological and, where possible, clinical data. Over the last 12 years, 171 unique agents have been evaluated by the iLCT committee, and there have been 21 completed clinical studies and 20 ongoing trials associated with the initiative. In this review, we briefly outline the iLCT process as well as the clinical development and outcomes of some of the top prioritized agents. We also discuss a few of the lessons that have been learnt, and we conclude with a perspective on what the next decade may bring, including the introduction of multi-arm, multi-stage clinical trial platforms and the possibility of combination therapies for PD.",

        "Abstract": "The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a crucial basal ganglia output nucleus, contains a dense expression of dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs), along with dendrites belonging to dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta. These D1Rs are primarily located on the terminals of striatonigral medium spiny neurons, suggesting their involvement in the regulation of neurotransmitter release from the direct pathway in response to somatodendritic dopamine release. To explore the hypothesis that D1Rs modulate GABA release from striatonigral synapses, we conducted optical recordings of striatonigral activity and postsynaptic patch-clamp recordings from SNr neurons in the presence of dopamine and D1R agonists. We found that dopamine inhibits optogenetically triggered striatonigral GABA release by modulating vesicle fusion and Ca ",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with autoimmune T cells that recognize the protein alpha-synuclein in a subset of individuals. Multiple neuroantigens are targets of autoinflammatory T cells in classical central nervous system autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we explored whether additional autoantigenic targets of T cells in PD. We generated 15-mer peptide pools spanning several PD-related proteins implicated in PD pathology, including GBA, SOD1, PINK1, parkin, OGDH, and LRRK2. Cytokine production (IFN\u03b3, IL-5, IL-10) against these proteins was measured using a fluorospot assay and PBMCs from patients with PD and age-matched healthy controls. This approach identified unique epitopes and their HLA restriction from the mitochondrial-associated protein PINK1, a regulator of mitochondrial stability, as an autoantigen targeted by T cells. The T cell reactivity was predominantly found in male patients with PD, which may contribute to the heterogeneity of PD. Identifying and characterizing PINK1 and other autoinflammatory targets may lead to antigen-specific diagnostics, progression markers, and/or novel therapeutic strategies for PD.",

        "Abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) consist of diverse neurodevelopmental conditions where core behavioral symptoms are critical for diagnosis. Altered dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum has been suggested to contribute to the behavioral features of ASD. Here, we examine dopamine neurotransmission in a mouse model of ASD characterized by elevated expression of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a key regulator of cap-dependent translation, using a comprehensive approach that encompasses genetics, behavior, synaptic physiology, and imaging. The results indicate that increased eIF4E expression leads to behavioral inflexibility and impaired striatal dopamine release. The loss of normal dopamine neurotransmission is due to a defective nicotinic receptor signaling that regulates calcium dynamics in dopaminergic axons. These findings reveal an intricate interplay between eIF4E, DA neurotransmission, and behavioral flexibility, provide a mechanistic understanding of ASD symptoms and offer a foundation for targeted therapeutic interventions.",

        "Abstract": "The modulation of dopamine release from midbrain projections to the striatum has long been demonstrated in reward-based learning, but the synaptic basis of aversive learning is far less characterized. The cerebellum receives axonal projections from the locus coeruleus, and norepinephrine release is implicated in states of arousal and stress, but whether aversive learning relies on plastic changes in norepinephrine release in the cerebellum is unknown. Here we report that in mice, norepinephrine is released in the cerebellum following an unpredicted noxious event (a foot-shock) and that this norepinephrine release is potentiated powerfully with fear acquisition as animals learn that a previously neutral stimulus (tone) predicts the aversive event. Importantly, both chemogenetic and optogenetic inhibition of the locus coeruleus-cerebellum pathway block fear memory without impairing motor function. Thus, norepinephrine release in the cerebellum is modulated by experience and underlies aversive learning.",

        "Title": "Perturbation of serine enantiomers homeostasis in the striatum of MPTP-lesioned monkeys and mice reflects the extent of dopaminergic midbrain degeneration.",
        "Abstract": "Loss of dopaminergic midbrain neurons perturbs l-serine and d-serine homeostasis in the post-mortem caudate putamen (CPu) of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, it is unclear whether the severity of dopaminergic nigrostriatal degeneration plays a role in deregulating serine enantiomers' metabolism. Here, through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), we measured the levels of these amino acids in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkeys and MPTP-plus-probenecid (MPTPp)-treated mice to determine whether and how dopaminergic midbrain degeneration affects the levels of serine enantiomers in various basal ganglia subregions. In addition, in the same brain regions, we measured the levels of key neuroactive amino acids modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission, including l-glutamate, glycine, l-aspartate, d-aspartate, and their precursors l-glutamine, l-asparagine. In monkeys, MPTP treatment produced severe denervation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic fibers (\u205375%) and increased the levels of serine enantiomers in the rostral putamen (rPut), but not in the subthalamic nucleus, and the lateral and medial portion of the globus pallidus. Moreover, this neurotoxin significantly reduced the protein expression of the astrocytic serine transporter ASCT1 and the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH in the rPut of monkeys. Conversely, concentrations of d-serine and l-serine, as well as ASCT1 and GAPDH expression were unaffected in the striatum of MPTPp-treated mice, which showed only mild dopaminergic degeneration (\u205330%). These findings unveil a link between the severity of dopaminergic nigrostriatal degeneration and striatal serine enantiomers concentration, ASCT1 and GAPDH expression. We hypothesize that the up-regulation of d-serine and l-serine levels occurs as a secondary response within a homeostatic loop to support the metabolic and neurotransmission demands imposed by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.",

        "Abstract": "L-serine generated in astrocytes plays a pivotal role in modulating essential neurometabolic processes, while its enantiomer, D-serine, specifically regulates NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signalling. Despite their physiological relevance in modulating cerebral activity, serine enantiomers metabolism in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains elusive. Using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), we measured D- and L-serine levels along with other amino acids known to modulate NMDAR function, such as L-glutamate, L-aspartate, D-aspartate, and glycine, in the post-mortem caudate putamen (CPu) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) of PD patients. Moreover, we examined these amino acids in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of de novo living PD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients versus subjects with other neurological disorders (OND), used as control. We found higher D-serine and L-serine levels in the CPu of PD patients but not in the SFG, a cerebral region that, in contrast to the CPu, is not innervated by nigral dopaminergic terminals. We also highlighted a significant elevation of both serine enantiomers in the CSF samples from PD but not in those of AD and ALS patients, compared with control subjects. By contrast, none or only minor changes were found in the amount of other NMDAR modulating amino acids. Our findings identify D-serine and L-serine level upregulation as a biochemical signature associated with nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration in PD.",

        "Abstract": "Dysregulated inflammation within the central nervous system (CNS) contributes to neuropathology in infectious, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disease. With the exception of microglia, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins are virtually undetectable in the mature, healthy central nervous system (CNS). Neurons have generally been considered incapable of antigen presentation, and although interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) can elicit neuronal MHC class I (MHC-I) expression and antigen presentation in vitro, it has been unclear whether similar responses occur in vivo. Here we directly injected IFN-\u03b3 into the ventral midbrain of mature mice and analyzed gene expression profiles of specific CNS cell types. We found that IFN-\u03b3 upregulated MHC-I and associated mRNAs in ventral midbrain microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and GABAergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic neurons. The core set of IFN-\u03b3-induced genes and their response kinetics were similar in neurons and glia, but with a lower amplitude of expression in neurons. A diverse repertoire of genes was upregulated in glia, particularly microglia, which were the only cells to undergo cellular proliferation and express MHC classII (MHC-II) and associated genes. To determine if neurons respond directly via cell-autonomous IFN-\u03b3 receptor (IFNGR) signaling, we produced mutant mice with a deletion of the IFN-\u03b3-binding domain of IFNGR1 in dopaminergic neurons, which resulted in a complete loss of dopaminergic neuronal responses to IFN-\u03b3. Our results demonstrate that IFN-\u03b3 induces neuronal IFNGR signaling and upregulation of MHC-I and related genes in vivo, although the expression level is low compared to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia.",

        "Abstract": "Auxilin participates in the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), thereby facilitating synaptic vesicle (SV) regeneration at presynaptic sites. Auxilin (DNAJC6/PARK19) loss-of-function mutations cause early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we utilized auxilin knockout (KO) mice to elucidate the mechanisms through which auxilin deficiency and clathrin-uncoating deficits lead to PD. Auxilin KO mice display cardinal features of PD, including progressive motor deficits, \u03b1-synuclein pathology, nigral dopaminergic loss, and neuroinflammation. Significantly, treatment with L-DOPA ameliorated motor deficits. Unbiased proteomic and neurochemical analyses of auxilin KO brains indicated dopamine dyshomeostasis. We validated these findings by demonstrating slower dopamine reuptake kinetics in\u00a0vivo, an effect associated with dopamine transporter misrouting into axonal membrane deformities in the dorsal striatum. Defective SV protein sorting and elevated synaptic autophagy also contribute to ineffective dopamine sequestration and compartmentalization, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration. This study provides insights into how presynaptic endocytosis deficits lead to dopaminergic vulnerability and pathogenesis of PD.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum is central to many normal and disease functions. Ventral midbrain dopamine neurons exhibit ongoing tonic firing that produces low extrasynaptic levels of dopamine below the detection of conventional extrasynaptic cyclic voltammetry (\u223c10-20 nanomolar), with superimposed bursts that can saturate the dopamine uptake transporter and produce transient micromolar concentrations. The bursts are known to lead to marked presynaptic plasticity via multiple mechanisms, but analysis methods for these kinetic parameters are limited. To provide a deeper understanding of the mechanics of the modulation of dopamine neurotransmission by physiological, genetic, and pharmacological means, we present three computational models of dopamine release with different levels of spatiotemporal complexity to analyze in vivo fast-scan cyclic voltammetry recordings from the dorsal striatum of mice. The models accurately fit to cyclic voltammetry data and provide estimates of presynaptic dopamine facilitation/depression kinetics and dopamine transporter reuptake kinetics, and we used the models to analyze the role of synuclein proteins in neurotransmission. The models' results support recent findings linking the presynaptic protein \u03b1-synuclein to the short-term facilitation and long-term depression of dopamine release, as well as reveal a new role for \u03b2-synuclein and/or \u03b3-synuclein in the long-term regulation of dopamine reuptake.",

        "Abstract": "In Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies, the elevation of \u03b1-synuclein phosphorylated at Serine129 (pS129) is a widely cited marker of pathology. However, the physiological role for pS129 has remained undefined. Here we use multiple approaches to show for the first time that pS129 functions as a physiological regulator of neuronal activity. Neuronal activity triggers a sustained increase of pS129 in cultured neurons (200% within 4\u2009h). In accord, brain pS129 is elevated in environmentally enriched mice exhibiting enhanced long-term potentiation. Activity-dependent \u03b1-synuclein phosphorylation is S129-specific, reversible, confers no cytotoxicity, and accumulates at synapsin-containing presynaptic boutons. Mechanistically, our findings are consistent with a model in which neuronal stimulation enhances Plk2 kinase activity via a calcium/calcineurin pathway to counteract PP2A phosphatase activity for efficient phosphorylation of membrane-bound \u03b1-synuclein.

        "Abstract": "Dopamine metabolism, alpha-synuclein pathology, and iron homeostasis have all been implicated as potential contributors to the unique vulnerability of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons which preferentially decline in Parkinson's disease and some rare neurodegenerative disorders with shared pathological features. However, the mechanisms contributing to disease progression and resulting in dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra are still not completely understood. Increasing evidence demonstrates that disrupted dopamine, alpha-synuclein, and/or iron pathways, when combined with the unique morphological, physiological, and metabolic features of this neuron population, may culminate in weakened resilience to multiple stressors. This review analyzes the involvement of each of these pathways in dopamine neuron physiology and function, and discusses how disrupted interplay of dopamine, alpha-synuclein, and iron pathways may synergize to promote pathology and drive the unique vulnerability to disease states. We suggest that elucidating the interactions of dopamine with iron and alpha-synuclein, and the role of dopamine metabolism in driving pathogenic phenotypes will be critical for developing therapeutics to prevent progression in diseases that show degeneration of nigral dopamine neurons such as Parkinson's disease and the rare family of disorders known as Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation.",

        "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is primarily regarded as a respiratory disease; however, multisystemic involvement accompanied by a variety of clinical manifestations, including neurological symptoms, are commonly observed. There is, however, little evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 infection of central nervous system cells, and neurological symptoms for the most part appear to be due to damage mediated by hypoxic/ischemic and/or inflammatory insults. In this chapter, we report evidence on candidate neuropathological mechanisms underlying neurological manifestations in Covid-19, suggesting that while there is mostly evidence against SARS-CoV-2 entry into brain parenchymal cells as a mechanism that may trigger Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism, that there are multiple means by which the virus may cause neurological symptoms.",

        "Abstract": "It has been suggested that the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is engaged in the early stages of motor learning for goal-directed actions, whereas at later stages, control is transferred to the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), a process that enables learned motor actions to become a skill or habit. It is not known whether these striatal regions are simultaneously active while the expertise is acquired. To address this question, we developed a mouse \"Treadmill Training Task\" that tracks changes in mouse locomotor coordination during running practice and simultaneously provides a means to measure local neuronal activity using photometry. To measure change in motor coordination over treadmill practice sessions, we used DeepLabCut (DLC) and custom-built code to analyze body position and paw movements. By evaluating improvements in motor coordination during training with simultaneous neuronal calcium activity in the striatum, we found that DMS direct pathway neurons exhibited decreased activity as the mouse gained proficiency at running. In contrast, direct pathway activity in the DLS was similar throughout training. Pharmacological blockade of D1 dopamine receptors in these subregions during task performance demonstrated that dopamine neurotransmission in the direct pathway activity is necessary for efficient motor coordination learning. These results provide new tools to measure changes in fine motor skills with simultaneous recordings of brain activity and reveal fundamental features of the neuronal substrates of motor learning.",

        "Abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a developmental disorder associated with epilepsy, autism, and cognitive impairment. Despite inactivating mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes and hyperactive mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, the mechanisms underlying TSC-associated neurological symptoms remain incompletely understood. Here we generate a Tsc1 conditional knockout (CKO) mouse model in which Tsc1 inactivation in late embryonic radial glia causes social and cognitive impairment and spontaneous seizures. Tsc1 depletion occurs in a subset of layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons, leading to development of cytomegalic pyramidal neurons (CPNs) that mimic dysplastic neurons in human TSC, featuring abnormal dendritic and axonal overgrowth, enhanced glutamatergic synaptic transmission, and increased susceptibility to seizure-like activities. We provide evidence that enhanced synaptic excitation in CPNs contributes to cortical hyperexcitability and epileptogenesis. In contrast, astrocytic regulation of synapse formation and synaptic transmission remains unchanged after late embryonic radial glial Tsc1 inactivation, and astrogliosis evolves secondary to seizures.",

        "Abstract": "Inhibition of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective type of lysosomal degradation for intracellular proteins, may contribute to pathogenesis in neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson disease (PD). Pathogenic variants of PD-related proteins that reside in the cytosol, including SNCA/alpha-synuclein, LRRK2 (leucine rich repeat kinase 2), UCHL1 (ubiquitin Cterminal hydrolase 1) and VPS35 (VPS35 retromer complex component), exert inhibitory effects on CMA. Decreased CMA activity has also been reported in sporadic PD patients, consistent with an association between CMA inhibition and PD. We have now reported the first example of CMA dysfunction caused by a non-cytosolic PD-related protein, GBA/\u03b2-glucocerebrosidase, the most common genetic risk factor for PD, which uncovers a new role for CMA in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control.",

        "Title": "Similarities and differences between nigral and enteric dopaminergic neurons unravel distinctive involvement in Parkinson's disease.",
        "Abstract": "In addition to the well-known degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, enteric neurons can also be affected in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Dopaminergic neurons have recently been identified in the enteric nervous system (ENS). While ENS dopaminergic neurons have been shown to degenerate in genetic mouse models of PD, analyses of their survival in enteric biopsies of PD patients have provided inconsistent results to date. In this context, this review seeks to highlight the distinctive and shared factors and properties that control the evolution of these two sets of dopaminergic neurons from neuronal precursors to aging neurons. Although their cellular sources and developmental times of origin differ, midbrain and ENS dopaminergic neurons express many transcription factors in common and their respective environments express similar neurotrophic molecules. For example, Foxa2 and Sox6 are expressed by both populations to promote the specification, differentiation, and long-term maintenance of the dopaminergic phenotype. Both populations exhibit sustained patterns of excitability that drive intrinsic vulnerability over time. In disorders such as PD, colon biopsies have revealed aggregation of alpha-synuclein in the submucosal plexus where dopaminergic neurons reside and lack blood barrier protection. Thus, these enteric neurons may be more susceptible to neurotoxic insults and aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein that spreads from gut to midbrain. Under sustained stress, inefficient autophagy leads to neurodegeneration, GI motility dysfunction, and PD symptoms. Recent findings suggest that novel neurotrophic factors such as CDNF have the potential to be used as neuroprotective agents to prevent and treat ENS symptoms of PD.",

        "Abstract": "Optical imaging of changes in the membrane potential of living cells can be achieved by means of fluorescent voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs). A particularly challenging task is to efficiently deliver these highly lipophilic probes to specific neuronal subpopulations in brain tissue. We have tackled this task by designing a solubilizing, hydrophilic polymer platform that carries a high-affinity ligand for a membrane protein marker of interest and a fluorescent VSD. Here, we disclose an improved design of polymer-supported probes for chemical, nongenetic targeting of voltage sensors to axons natively expressing the dopamine transporter in ex vivo mouse brain tissue. We first show that for negatively charged rhodol VSDs functioning on the photoinduced electron transfer principle, poly(ethylene glycol) as a carrier enables targeting with higher selectivity than the polysaccharide dextran in HEK cell culture. In the same experimental setting, we also demonstrate that incorporation of an azetidine ring into the rhodol chromophore substantially increases the brightness and voltage sensitivity of the respective VSD. We show that the superior properties of the optimized sensor are transferable to recording of electrically evoked activity from dopaminergic axons in mouse striatal slices after averaging of multiple trials. Finally, we suggest the next milestones for the field to achieve single-scan recordings with nongenetically targeted VSDs in native brain tissue.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multi-stage neurodegenerative disorder with largely unknown etiology. Recent findings have identified PD-associated autoimmune features including roles for T cells. To further characterize the role of T cells in PD, we performed RNA sequencing on PBMC and peripheral CD4 and CD8 memory T cell subsets derived from PD patients and age-matched healthy controls. When the groups were stratified by their T cell responsiveness to alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) as a proxy for an ongoing inflammatory autoimmune response, the study revealed a broad differential gene expression profile in memory T cell subsets and a specific PD associated gene signature. We identified significant enrichment of transcriptomic signatures previously associated with PD, including for oxidative stress, phosphorylation, autophagy of mitochondria, cholesterol metabolism and inflammation, and the chemokine signaling proteins CX3CR1, CCR5, and CCR1. In addition, we identified genes in these peripheral cells that have previously been shown to be involved in PD pathogenesis and expressed in neurons, such as LRRK2, LAMP3, and aquaporin. Together, these findings suggest that features of circulating T cells with \u03b1-syn-specific responses in PD patients provide insights into the interactive processes that occur during PD pathogenesis and suggest potential intervention targets.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies often exhibit autoimmune features, including CD4+ and some CD8+ T lymphocytes that recognize epitopes derived from alpha-synuclein. While neurons have long been considered to not present antigens, recent data indicate that they can be induced to do so, particularly in response to interferons and other forms of stress. Here, we review literature on neuronal antigen presentation and its potential role in PD. Although direct evidence for CD8+ T cell-mediated neuronal death is lacking in PD, neuronal antigen presentation appears central to the pathology of Rasmussen's encephalitis, a pediatric neurological disorder driven by cytotoxic T cell infiltration and neuroinflammation. Emerging data suggest that T cells enter the brain in PD and other synucleinopathies, where the majority of neuromelanin-containing substantia nigra and locus coeruleus neurons express MHC Class I molecules. In cell culture, CD8+ T cell recognition of antigen:MHC Class I complexes on neuronal membranes leads to cytotoxic responses and neuronal cell death. Recent animal models suggest the possibility of T cell autoreactivity to mitochondrial antigens in PD. It remains unclear if neuronal antigen presentation plays a role in PD or other neurodegenerative disorders, and efforts are underway to better elucidate the potential impact of autoimmune responses on neurodegeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons modulate neural circuits and behaviors via dopamine (DA) release from expansive, long range axonal projections. The elaborate cytoarchitecture of these neurons is embedded within complex brain tissue, making it difficult to access the neuronal proteome using conventional methods. Here, we demonstrate APEX2 proximity labeling within genetically targeted neurons in the mouse brain, enabling subcellular proteomics with cell-type specificity. By combining APEX2 biotinylation with mass spectrometry, we mapped the somatodendritic and axonal proteomes of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Our dataset reveals the proteomic architecture underlying proteostasis, axonal metabolism, and neurotransmission in these neurons. We find that most proteins encoded by DA neuron-enriched genes are localized within striatal dopaminergic axons, including ion channels with previously undescribed axonal localization. These proteomic datasets provide a resource for neuronal cell biology, and this approach can be readily adapted for study of other neural cell types.",

        "Abstract": "The notion that autoimmune responses to \u03b1-synuclein may be involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder stems from reports that mutations in \u03b1-synuclein or certain alleles of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are associated with the disease and that dopaminergic and norepinephrinergic neurons in the midbrain can present antigenic epitopes. Here, we discuss recent evidence that a defined set of peptides derived from \u03b1-synuclein act as antigenic epitopes displayed by specific MHC alleles and drive helper and cytotoxic T cell responses in patients with PD. Moreover, phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein may activate T cell responses in a less restricted manner in PD. While the roles for the acquired immune system in disease pathogenesis remain unknown, preclinical animal models and in vitro studies indicate that T cells may interact with neurons and exert effects related to neuronal death and neuroprotection. These findings suggest that therapeutics that target T cells and ameliorate the incidence or disease severity of inflammatory bowel disorders or CNS autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis may be useful in PD.",

        "Abstract": "Midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons exhibit extensive dendritic and axonal arborizations, but local protein synthesis is not characterized in these neurons. Here, we investigate messenger RNA (mRNA) localization and translation in mDA neuronal axons and dendrites, both of which release dopamine (DA). Using highly sensitive ribosome-bound RNA sequencing and imaging approaches, we find no evidence for mRNA translation in mDA axons. In contrast, mDA neuronal dendrites in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) contain ribosomes and mRNAs encoding the major components of DA synthesis, release, and reuptake machinery. Surprisingly, we also observe dendritic localization of mRNAs encoding synaptic vesicle-related proteins, including those involved in exocytic fusion. Our results are consistent with a role for local translation in the regulation of DA release from dendrites, but not from axons. Our translatome data define a molecular signature of sparse mDA neurons in the SNr, including the enrichment of Atp2a3/SERCA3, an atypical ER calcium pump.",

        "Abstract": "CalDAG-GEFI (CDGI) is a protein highly enriched in the striatum, particularly in the principal spiny projection neurons (SPNs). CDGI is strongly down-regulated in two hyperkinetic conditions related to striatal dysfunction: Huntington's disease and levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. We demonstrate that genetic deletion of CDGI in mice disrupts dendritic, but not somatic, M1 muscarinic receptors (M1Rs) signaling in indirect pathway SPNs. Loss of CDGI reduced temporal integration of excitatory postsynaptic potentials at dendritic glutamatergic synapses and impaired the induction of activity-dependent long-term potentiation. CDGI deletion selectively increased psychostimulant-induced repetitive behaviors, disrupted sequence learning, and eliminated M1R blockade of cocaine self-administration. These findings place CDGI as a major, but previously unrecognized, mediator of cholinergic signaling in the striatum. The effects of CDGI deletion on the self-administration of drugs of abuse and its marked alterations in hyperkinetic extrapyramidal disorders highlight CDGI's therapeutic potential.",

        "Abstract": "With the advent of the genetic era in Parkinson's disease (PD) research in 1997, \u03b1-synuclein was identified as an important player in a complex neurodegenerative disease that affects >10 million people worldwide. PD has been estimated to have an economic impact of $51.9 billion in the US alone. Since the initial association with PD, hundreds of researchers have contributed to elucidating the functions of \u03b1-synuclein in normal and pathological states, and these remain critical areas for continued research. With this position paper the authors strive to achieve two goals: first, to succinctly summarize the critical features that define \u03b1-synuclein's varied roles, as they are known today; and second, to identify the most pressing knowledge gaps and delineate a multipronged strategy for future research with the goal of enabling therapies to stop or slow disease progression in PD.",

Here, we review the role of the striatum and its connections in motor learning and performance. The development of new techniques to record neuronal activity and animal models of motor disorders using neurotoxin, pharmacological, and genetic manipulations are revealing pathways that underlie motor performance and motor learning, as well as how they are altered by pathophysiological mechanisms. We discuss approaches that can be used to analyze complex motor skills, particularly in rodents, and identify specific questions central to understanding how striatal circuits mediate motor learning.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine is a modulatory neurotransmitter involved in learning, motor functions, and reward. Many neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, autism, and schizophrenia, are associated with imbalances or dysfunction in the dopaminergic system. Yet, our understanding of these pervasive public health issues is limited by our ability to effectively image dopamine in humans, which has long been a goal for chemists and neuroscientists. The last two decades have witnessed the development of many molecules used to trace dopamine. We review the small molecules, nanoparticles, and protein sensors used with fluorescent microscopy/photometry, MRI, and PET that shape dopamine research today. None of these tools observe dopamine itself, but instead harness the biology of the dopamine system-its synthetic and metabolic pathways, synaptic vesicle cycle, and receptors-in elegant ways. Their advantages and weaknesses are covered here, along with recent examples and the chemistry and biology that allow them to function.",

Using mouse models with systemic and neuronal-specific CMA blockage, we demonstrate that loss of neuronal CMA leads to altered neuronal function, selective changes in the neuronal metastable proteome, and proteotoxicity, all reminiscent of brain aging. Imposing CMA loss on a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has synergistic negative effects on the proteome at risk of aggregation, thus increasing neuronal disease vulnerability and accelerating disease progression. Conversely, chemical enhancement of CMA ameliorates pathology in two different AD experimental mouse models. We conclude that functional CMA is essential for neuronal proteostasis through the maintenance of a subset of the proteome with a higher risk of misfolding than the general proteome.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to identify and avoid environmental stimuli that signal danger is essential to survival. Our understanding of how the brain encodes aversive behaviors has been primarily focused on roles for the amygdala, hippocampus (HIPP), prefrontal cortex, ventral midbrain, and ventral striatum. Relatively little attention has been paid to contributions from the dorsal striatum (DS) to aversive learning, despite its well-established role in stimulus-response learning. Here, we review studies exploring the role of DS in aversive learning, including different roles for the dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum in Pavlovian fear conditioning as well as innate and inhibitory avoidance (IA) behaviors. We outline how future investigation might determine specific contributions from DS subregions, cell types, and connections that contribute to aversive behavior.",

The striatum is a subcortical nucleus critical to action selection, motor learning, and reward processing. Its tonically active cholinergic interneuron (ChI) is an integral regulator of the synaptic activity of other striatal neurons, as well as afferent axonal projections of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons; however, little is known about its development. Here, we report that ChI spontaneous activity increases during postnatal development of male and female mice, concomitant with a decreased afterhyperpolarization (AHP). We characterized the postnatal development of four currents that contribute to the spontaneous firing rate of ChIs, including I",

        "Abstract": "The self-antigen \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) was recently shown to be associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we mapped the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of \u03b1-syn-specific T cells from six PD patients. The self-antigen \u03b1-syn-specific repertoire was compared to the repertoire of T cells specific for pertussis (PT), as a representative foreign antigen that most individuals are exposed to, revealing that the repertoire for \u03b1-syn was as diverse as the repertoire for PT. The diversity of PT-specific clonotypes was similar between individuals with PD diagnosis and age-matched healthy controls. We found that the TCR repertoire was specific to each PD patient, and no shared TCRs among patients were defined, likely due to differences in HLA expression that select for different subsets of epitope-specific TCR rearrangements. This study provides the first characterization of \u03b1-syn-specific TCR clonotypes in individuals with PD. Antigen-specific TCRs can serve as immunotherapeutics and diagnostics, and means to track longitudinal changes in specific T cells, and disease progression.",

        "Abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein is expressed at high levels at presynaptic terminals, but defining its role in the regulation of neurotransmission under physiologically relevant conditions has proven elusive. We report that, in vivo, \u03b1-synuclein is responsible for the facilitation of dopamine release triggered by action potential bursts separated by short intervals (seconds) and a depression of release with longer intervals between bursts (minutes). These forms of presynaptic plasticity appear to be independent of the presence of \u03b2- and \u03b3-synucleins or effects on presynaptic calcium and are consistent with a role for synucleins in the enhancement of synaptic vesicle fusion and turnover. These results indicate that the presynaptic effects of \u03b1-synuclein depend on specific patterns of neuronal activity.",

In the past decade, research-focused efforts in preclinical and experimental models have rallied around this idea, and considerable effort has been made to delineate critical neuroinflammatory processes. In this article, we discuss challenges in preclinical research, notably the use of animal models to recapitulate and dissect disease phenotypes as well as the need for more sensitive, reliable radiotracers to detect on-target efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments in both human Parkinson's disease as well as preclinical models. \u00a9 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a chronic multifactorial and complex neurodegenerative disorder is a leading cause of dementia. Recently, neuroinflammation has been hypothesized as a contributing factor to AD pathogenesis. The role of adaptive immune responses against neuronal antigens, which can either confer protection or induce damage in AD, has not been fully characterized. Here, we measured T cell responses to several potential antigens of neural origin including amyloid precursor protein (APP), amyloid beta (A\u03b2), tau, \u03b1-synuclein, and transactive response DNA binding protein (TDP-43) in patients with AD and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Antigen-specific T cell reactivity was detected for all tested antigens, and response to tau-derived epitopes was particularly strong, but no significant differences between individuals with AD and age-matched HC were identified. We also did not observe any correlation between the antigen-specific T cell responses and clinical variables including age, gender, years since diagnosis and cognitive score. Additionally, further characterization did not reveal any differences in the relative frequency of major Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) subsets, or in the expression of genes between AD patients and HC. These observations have not identified a key role of neuronal antigen-specific T cell responses in AD.",

        "Abstract": "This Viewpoint discusses insights from basic science and clinical perspectives on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)/severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the brain, with a particular focus on Parkinson's disease. Major points include that neuropathology studies have not answered the central issue of whether the virus enters central nervous system neurons, astrocytes or microglia, and the brain vascular cell types that express virus have not yet been identified. Currently, there is no clear evidence for human neuronal or astrocyte expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the major receptor for viral entry, but ACE2 expression may be activated by inflammation, and a comparison of healthy and infected brains is important. In contrast to the 1918 influenza pandemic and avian flu, reports of encephalopathy in COVID-19 have been slow to emerge, and there are so far no documented reports of parkinsonism apart from a single case report. We recommend consensus guidelines for the clinical treatment of Parkinson's patients with COVID-19. While a role for the virus in causing or exacerbating Parkinson's disease appears unlikely at this time, aggravation of specific motor and non-motor symptoms has been reported, and it will be important to monitor subjects after recovery, particularly for those with persisting hyposmia.",

        "Abstract": "Changes in striatal cholinergic interneuron (ChI) activity are thought to contribute to Parkinson's disease pathophysiology and dyskinesia from chronic L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) treatment, but the physiological basis of these changes is unknown. We find that dopamine lesion decreases the spontaneous firing rate of ChIs, whereas chronic treatment with L-DOPA of lesioned mice increases baseline ChI firing rates to levels beyond normal activity. The effect of dopamine loss on ChIs was due to decreased currents of both hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) and small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels. L-DOPA reinstatement of dopamine normalized HCN activity, but SK current remained depressed. Pharmacological blockade of HCN and SK activities mimicked changes in firing, confirming that these channels are responsible for the molecular adaptation of ChIs to dopamine loss and chronic L-DOPA treatment. These findings suggest that targeting ChIs with channel-specific modulators may provide therapeutic approaches for alleviating L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in PD patients.",

        "Abstract": "Voltage sensitive fluorescent dyes (VSDs) are important tools for probing signal transduction in neurons and other excitable cells. The impact of these highly lipophilic sensors has, however, been limited due to the lack of cell-specific targeting methods in brain tissue or living animals. We address this key challenge by introducing a nongenetic molecular platform for cell- and molecule-specific targeting of synthetic VSDs in the brain. We employ a dextran polymer particle to overcome the inherent lipophilicity of VSDs by dynamic encapsulation and high-affinity ligands to target the construct to specific neuronal cells utilizing only native components of the neurotransmission machinery at physiological expression levels. Dichloropane, a monoamine transporter ligand, enables targeting of dense dopaminergic axons in the mouse striatum and sparse noradrenergic axons in the mouse cortex in acute brain slices. PFQX in conjunction with ligand-directed acyl imidazole chemistry enables covalent labeling of AMPA-type glutamate receptors in the same brain regions. Probe variants bearing either a classical electrochromic ANEP dye or state-of-the-art VoltageFluor-type dye respond to membrane potential changes in a similar manner to the parent dyes, as shown by whole-cell patch recording. We demonstrate the feasibility of optical voltage recording with our probes in brain tissue with one-photon and two-photon fluorescence microscopy and define the signal limits of optical voltage imaging with synthetic sensors under a low photon budget determined by the native expression levels of the target proteins. This work demonstrates the feasibility of a chemical targeting approach and expands the possibilities of cell-specific imaging and pharmacology.",

        "Abstract": "A diagnosis of motor Parkinson's disease (PD) is preceded by a prolonged premotor phase with accumulating neuronal damage. Here we examined the temporal relation between \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) T cell reactivity and PD. A longitudinal case study revealed that elevated \u03b1-syn-specific T cell responses were detected prior to the diagnosis of motor PD, and declined after. The relationship between T cell reactivity and early PD in two independent cohorts showed that \u03b1-syn-specific T cell responses were highest shortly after diagnosis of motor PD and then decreased. Additional analysis revealed significant association of \u03b1-syn-specific T cell responses with age and lower levodopa equivalent dose. These results confirm the presence of \u03b1-syn-reactive T cells in PD and show that they are most abundant immediately after diagnosis of motor PD. These cells may be present years before the diagnosis of motor PD, suggesting avenues of investigation into PD pathogenesis and potential early diagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) plays a critical role in neuronal function related to development and degeneration. Here, we investigated whether autophagy is developmentally regulated in the striatum, a brain region implicated in neurodevelopmental disease. We demonstrate that autophagic flux is suppressed during striatal postnatal development, reaching adult levels around postnatal day 28 (P28). We also find that mTOR signaling, a key regulator of autophagy, increases during the same developmental period. We further show that mTOR signaling is responsible for suppressing autophagy, via regulation of Beclin-1 and VPS34 activity. Finally, we discover that autophagy is downregulated during late striatal postnatal development (P28) in mice with ",

        "Abstract": "Macroautophagy/autophagy is implicated in the maintenance of normal neuronal activity through the regulation of synaptic function and plasticity. However, differences in autophagic degradation within different classes of neurons have not been examined. We have recently demonstrated that autophagy plays very different roles in the two closely related principal neurons of the striatum - the spiny projection neurons of the direct (dSPN) and indirect (iSPN) pathways. Behavioral and electrophysiological experiments revealed that the absence of autophagy in either of these SPN pathways produces unique effects on motor learning, dendritic length, and intrinsic excitability. Specifically, autophagy is required for the normal development of synaptic inputs onto dSPNs, while being required for intrinsic excitability in iSPNs. In iSPNs, this occurs through the regulation of the activity of the KCNJ/Kir2 ion channel, and provides a first demonstration of autophagic control of neuronal intrinsic excitability.",

The principal neurons of the striatum, spiny projection neurons of the direct (dSPN) and indirect (iSPN) pathways, maintain low intrinsic excitability, requiring convergent excitatory inputs to fire. Here, we examined the role of autophagy in mouse SPN physiology and animal behavior by generating conditional knockouts of Atg7 in either dSPNs or iSPNs. Loss of autophagy in either SPN population led to changes in motor learning but distinct effects on cellular physiology. dSPNs, but not iSPNs, required autophagy for normal dendritic structure and synaptic input. In contrast, iSPNs, but not dSPNs, were intrinsically hyperexcitable due to reduced function of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir2. These findings define a novel mechanism by which autophagy regulates neuronal activity: control of intrinsic excitability via the regulation of potassium channel function.",

In neurons, autophagy was originally described as associated with disease states and neuronal survival. Over the last decade, however, evidence has accumulated that autophagy controls synaptic function in both the axon and dendrite. Here, we review this literature, highlighting the role of autophagy in the pre- and postsynapse, synaptic plasticity, and behavior. We end by discussing open questions in the field of synaptic autophagy.",

The causes of neurodegeneration are mostly unknown, although current efforts have described an autoimmune aspect to these diseases.

We focus on the identification of T cell epitopes from proteins involved in disease pathogenesis and describe the identification of \u03b1-synuclein-specific epitopes in Parkinson's disease which provided a crucial link between disease susceptibility and T cell recognition.",

        "Abstract": "The protein \u03b1-synuclein has a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). In this review, we discuss recent results concerning its primary function, which appears to be on cell membranes. The pre-synaptic location of synuclein has suggested a role in neurotransmitter release and it apparently associates with synaptic vesicles because of their high curvature. Indeed, synuclein over-expression inhibits synaptic vesicle exocytosis. However, loss of synuclein has not yet been shown to have a major effect on synaptic transmission. Consistent with work showing that synuclein can promote as well as sense membrane curvature, recent analysis of synuclein triple knockout mice now shows that synuclein accelerates dilation of the exocytic fusion pore. This form of regulation affects primarily the release of slowly discharged lumenal cargo such as neural peptides, but presumably also contributes to maintenance of the release site. This article is part of the Special Issue \"Synuclein\".",

We thus compared T cell responses to tau and p-tau-derived peptides between PD patients, age-matched healthy controls, and young healthy controls (<35 y old; who are less likely to have high levels of tau aggregates).

Increasing evidence suggests that FMRP regulates both translation initiation and elongation, but the gene specificity of these effects is unclear. To elucidate the impact of\u00a0Fmr1 loss on translation, we utilize ribosome profiling for genome-wide measurements of ribosomal occupancy and positioning in the cortex of 24-day-old Fmr1 knockout mice. We find a remarkably coherent reduction in ribosome footprint abundance per mRNA for previously identified, high-affinity mRNA binding partners of FMRP and an increase for terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif-containing genes canonically controlled by mammalian target of rapamycin-eIF4E-binding protein-eIF4E binding protein-eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (mTOR-4E-BP-eIF4E) signaling. Amino acid motif- and gene-level analyses both show a widespread reduction of translational pausing in Fmr1 knockout mice. Our findings are consistent with a model of FMRP-mediated regulation of both translation initiation through eIF4E and elongation that is disrupted in fragile X\u00a0syndrome.",

        "Title": "Autoimmunity in Parkinson's Disease: The Role of \u03b1-Synuclein-Specific T Cells.",
        "Abstract": "Evidence from a variety of studies implicates a role for the adaptive immune system in Parkinson's disease (PD). Similar to multiple sclerosis (MS) patients who display a high number of T cells in the brain attacking oligodendrocytes, PD patients show higher numbers of T cells in the ventral midbrain than healthy, age-matched controls. Mouse models of the disease also show the presence of T cells in the brain. The role of these infiltrating T cells in the propagation of disease is controversial; however, recent studies indicate that they may be autoreactive in nature, recognizing disease-altered self-proteins as foreign antigens. T cells of PD patients can generate an autoimmune response to \u03b1-synuclein, a protein that is aggregated in PD. \u03b1-Synuclein and other proteins are post-translationally modified in an environment in which protein processing is altered, possibly leading to the generation of neo-epitopes, or self-peptides that have not been identified by the host immune system as non-foreign. Infiltrating T cells may also be responding to such modified proteins. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown associations of PD with haplotypes of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes, and a polymorphism in a non-coding region that may increase MHC class II in PD patients. We speculate that the inflammation observed in PD may play both pathogenic and protective roles. Future studies on the adaptive immune system in neurodegenerative disorders may elucidate steps in disease pathogenesis and assist with the development of both biomarkers and treatments.",

        "Abstract": "Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI) purports to detect the content of neuromelanin (NM), a product of dopamine metabolism that accumulates with age in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra (SN). Interindividual variability in dopamine function may result in varying levels of NM accumulation in the SN; however, the ability of NM-MRI to measure dopamine function in nonneurodegenerative conditions has not been established. Here, we validated that NM-MRI signal intensity in postmortem midbrain specimens correlated with regional NM concentration even in the absence of neurodegeneration, a prerequisite for its use as a proxy for dopamine function. We then validated a voxelwise NM-MRI approach with sufficient anatomical sensitivity to resolve SN subregions. Using this approach and a multimodal dataset of molecular PET and fMRI data, we further showed the NM-MRI signal was related to both dopamine release in the dorsal striatum and resting blood flow within the SN. These results suggest that NM-MRI signal in the SN is a proxy for function of dopamine neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. As a proof of concept for its clinical utility, we show that the NM-MRI signal correlated to severity of psychosis in schizophrenia and individuals at risk for schizophrenia, consistent with the well-established dysfunction of the nigrostriatal pathway in psychosis. Our results indicate that noninvasive NM-MRI is a promising tool that could have diverse research and clinical applications to investigate in vivo the role of dopamine in neuropsychiatric illness.",

        "Abstract": "The loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons containing neuromelanin underlies the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Neuromelanin accumulation into autophagic lysosomes is evidence of ongoing cytosolic dopamine stress in these neurons during normal aging. The formation of neuromelanin is likely neuroprotective, as oxidation of cytosolic dopamine to quinones and aldehydes, as reviewed here, can produce a host of neurotoxic sequela. In addition to sequestration of dopamine and its metabolites in autophagic lysosomes, the uptake of dopamine into monoaminergic neurons mediated by vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT- 2), prevents dopamine oxidation. Dopamine is stable in monoaminergic vesicles due to their low pH, and thus overexpression of VMAT-2 may provide a target for potential neuroprotective therapy in Parkinson's disease.",

Degeneration of nigrostriatal neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta in Parkinson's disease represents the best-studied link between DA neurotransmission and neuropathology. Catecholamines are reactive molecules that are handled through complex control and transport systems. Under normal conditions, small amounts of cytosolic DA are converted to neuromelanin in a stepwise process involving melanization of peptides and proteins. However, excessive cytosolic or extraneuronal DA can give rise to nonselective protein modifications. These reactions involve DA oxidation to quinone species and depend on the presence of redox-active transition metal ions such as iron and copper. Other oxidized DA metabolites likely participate in post-translational protein modification. Thus, protein-quinone modification is a heterogeneous process involving multiple DA-derived residues that produce structural and conformational changes of proteins and can lead to aggregation and inactivation of the modified proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Epithelial-neuronal signaling is essential for sensory encoding in touch, itch, and nociception; however, little is known about the release mechanisms and neurotransmitter receptors through which skin cells govern neuronal excitability. Merkel cells are mechanosensory epidermal cells that have long been proposed to activate neuronal afferents through chemical synaptic transmission. We employed a set of classical criteria for chemical neurotransmission as a framework to test this hypothesis. RNA sequencing of adult mouse Merkel cells demonstrated that they express presynaptic molecules and biosynthetic machinery for adrenergic transmission. Moreover, live-cell imaging directly demonstrated that Merkel cells mediate activity- and VMAT-dependent release of fluorescent catecholamine neurotransmitter analogs. Touch-evoked firing in Merkel-cell afferents was inhibited either by pre-synaptic silencing of SNARE-mediated vesicle release from Merkel cells or by neuronal deletion of \u03b2",

A formula for the complex energy correction that determines the decay rate is presented; the configuration interaction effect together with major molecule-surface interactions are considered in more detail as compared to previous studies. Furthermore, the lifetimes of the excited states of Ru-terpyridine dyes adsorbed on an anatase surface are calculated, and the effects of the molecular structure and adsorption mode on the electron injection rate are studied. Also, the adsorption structures and relative stabilities of a series of Ru-terpyridine dyes-including the black dye-are reported. An implicit solvation model is necessary to reliably calculate the alignment between the photoabsorption spectrum and the conduction band density of states, governing the injection rate. Finally, some of the factors that limit the injection ability of dyes are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Neural circuits are formed and refined during childhood, including via critical changes in neuronal excitability. Here, we investigated the ontogeny of striatal intrinsic excitability. We found that dopamine neurotransmission increases from the first to the third postnatal week in mice and precedes the reduction in spiny projection neuron (SPN) intrinsic excitability during the fourth postnatal week. In mice developmentally deficient for striatal dopamine, direct pathway D1-SPNs failed to undergo maturation of excitability past P18 and maintained hyperexcitability into adulthood. We found that the absence of D1-SPN maturation was due to altered phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate dynamics and a consequent lack of normal ontogenetic increases in Kir2 currents. Dopamine replacement corrected these deficits in SPN excitability when provided from birth or during a specific period of juvenile development (P18-P28), but not during adulthood. These results identify a sensitive period of dopamine-dependent striatal maturation, with implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Norepinephrine is a monoamine neurotransmitter with a wide repertoire of physiological roles in the peripheral and central nervous systems. There are, however, no experimental means to study functional properties of individual noradrenergic synapses in the brain. Development of new approaches for imaging synaptic neurotransmission is of fundamental importance to study specific synaptic changes that occur during learning, behavior, and pathological processes. Here, we introduce fluorescent false neurotransmitter 270 (FFN270), a fluorescent tracer of norepinephrine. As a fluorescent substrate of the norepinephrine and vesicular monoamine transporters, FFN270 labels noradrenergic neurons and their synaptic vesicles, and enables imaging synaptic vesicle content release from specific axonal sites in living rodents. Combining FFN270 imaging and optogenetic stimulation, we find heterogeneous release properties of noradrenergic synapses in the somatosensory cortex, including low and high releasing populations. Through systemic amphetamine administration, we observe rapid release of cortical noradrenergic vesicular content, providing insight into the drug's effect.",

        "Abstract": "During aging, neuronal organelles filled with neuromelanin (a dark-brown pigment) and lipid bodies accumulate in the brain, particularly in the substantia nigra, a region targeted in Parkinson's disease. We have investigated protein and lipid systems involved in the formation of these organelles and in the synthesis of the neuromelanin of human substantia nigra. Membrane and matrix proteins characteristic of lysosomes were found in neuromelanin-containing organelles at a lower number than in typical lysosomes, indicating a reduced enzymatic activity and likely impaired capacity for lysosomal and autophagosomal fusion. The presence of proteins involved in lipid transport may explain the accumulation of lipid bodies in the organelle and the lipid component in neuromelanin structure. The major lipids observed in lipid bodies of the organelle are dolichols with lower amounts of other lipids. Proteins of aggregation and degradation pathways were present, suggesting a role for accumulation by this organelle when the ubiquitin-proteasome system is inadequate. The presence of proteins associated with aging and storage diseases may reflect impaired autophagic degradation or impaired function of lysosomal enzymes. The identification of typical autophagy proteins and double membranes demonstrates the organelle's autophagic nature and indicates that it has engulfed neuromelanin precursors from the cytosol. Based on these data, it appears that the neuromelanin-containing organelle has a very slow turnover during the life of a neuron and represents an intracellular compartment of final destination for numerous molecules not degraded by other systems.",

        "Title": "Roles for neuronal and glial autophagy in synaptic pruning during development.",
        "Abstract": "The dendritic protrusions known as spines represent the primary postsynaptic location for excitatory synapses. Dendritic spines are critical for many synaptic functions, and their formation, modification, and turnover are thought to be important for mechanisms of learning and memory. At many excitatory synapses, dendritic spines form during the early postnatal period, and while many spines are likely being formed and removed throughout life, the net number are often gradually \"pruned\" during adolescence to reach a stable level in the adult. In neurodevelopmental disorders, spine pruning is disrupted, emphasizing the importance of understanding its governing processes. Autophagy, a process through which cytosolic components and organelles are degraded, has recently been shown to control spine pruning in the mouse cortex, but the mechanisms through which autophagy acts remain obscure. Here, we draw on three widely studied prototypical synaptic pruning events to focus on two governing principles of spine pruning: 1) activity-dependent synaptic competition and 2) non-neuronal contributions. We briefly review what is known about autophagy in the central nervous system and its regulation by metabolic kinases. We propose a model in which autophagy in both neurons and non-neuronal cells contributes to spine pruning, and how other processes that regulate spine pruning could intersect with autophagy. We further outline future research directions to address outstanding questions on the role of autophagy in synaptic pruning.",

        "Abstract": "The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) occurs after pathogenesis is advanced and many substantia nigra (SN) dopamine neurons have already died. Now that therapies to block this neuronal loss are under development, it is imperative that the disease be diagnosed at earlier stages and that the response to therapies is monitored. Recent studies suggest this can be accomplished by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detection of neuromelanin (NM), the characteristic pigment of SN dopaminergic, and locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons. NM is an autophagic product synthesized via oxidation of catecholamines and subsequent reactions, and in the SN and LC it increases linearly during normal aging. In PD, however, the pigment is lost when SN and LC neurons die. As shown nearly 25 years ago by Zecca and colleagues, NM's avid binding of iron provides a paramagnetic source to enable electron and nuclear magnetic resonance detection, and thus a means for safe and noninvasive measure in living human brain. Recent technical improvements now provide a means for MRI to differentiate between PD patients and age-matched healthy controls, and should be able to identify changes in SN NM with age in individuals. We discuss how MRI detects NM and how this approach might be improved. We suggest that MRI of NM can be used to confirm PD diagnosis and monitor disease progression. We recommend that for subjects at risk for PD, and perhaps generally for older people, that MRI sequences performed at regular intervals can provide a pre-clinical means to detect presymptomatic PD.",

On the other hand, these cultures are more challenging to produce consistently. Here, we provide an easy-to-implement protocol for culturing postnatal ventral mesencephalic cells from the substantia nigra (SN) and the ventral tegmental area using commercially available media, dishes, and general lab equipment, avoiding extensive material and equipment purchases. The protocol can be completed in about 5 h and provides ventral midbrain neuron cultures on cortex glia feeder layers in three weeks' time. The protocol uses an optimized protease digestion, tissue storage in Hibernate A during dissection and purification of neurons on an OptiPrep density gradient.",

        "Abstract": "Multiphoton microscopy has been widely adapted for imaging neurons in vivo. Repeated imaging requires implantation of a cranial window or repeated thinning of the skull. Cranial window surgery is typically performed with a high speed rotary drill, and many investigators find it challenging to prevent the drill from damaging the delicate dura and blood vessels. Extensive training and practice is required to remove the bone without damage to underlying tissue and thus cranial window surgery can be difficult, time consuming, and produce tissue damage. Piezoelectric surgery, which is extensively used for maxillofacial and dental surgery, utilizes ultrasonic vibrations to remove bone without damaging soft tissues. We have developed a method applying piezoelectric surgery to improve cranial window surgery in mice in preparation for multiphoton imaging. Comparisons within our lab find that the method requires less surgery time and has a lower average rate of complications due to dural bleeding than cranial window surgery with a rotary drill.",

        "Abstract": "Many learned responses depend on the coordinated activation and inhibition of synaptic pathways in the striatum. Local dopamine neurotransmission acts in concert with a variety of neurotransmitters to regulate cortical, thalamic, and limbic excitatory inputs to drive the direct and indirect striatal spiny projection neuron outputs that determine the activity, sequence, and timing of learned behaviors. We review recent advances in the characterization of stereotyped neuronal and operant responses that predict and then obtain rewards. These depend on the local release of dopamine at discrete times during behavioral sequences, which, acting with glutamate, provides a presynaptic filter to select which excitatory synapses are inhibited and which signals pass to indirect pathway circuits. This is followed by dopamine-dependent activation of specific direct pathway circuits to procure a reward. These steps may provide a means by which higher organisms learn behaviors in response to feedback from the environment.",

        "Abstract": "Ongoing efforts in our laboratories focus on design of optical reporters known as fluorescent false neurotransmitters (FFNs) that enable the visualization of uptake into, packaging within, and release from individual monoaminergic neurons and presynaptic sites in the brain. Here, we introduce the molecular probe FFN246 as an expansion of the FFN platform to the serotonergic system. Combining the acridone fluorophore with the ethylamine recognition element of serotonin, we identified FFN54 and FFN246 as substrates for both the serotonin transporter and the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). A systematic structure-activity study revealed the basic structural chemotype of aminoalkyl acridones required for serotonin transporter (SERT) activity and enabled lowering the background labeling of these probes while maintaining SERT activity, which proved essential for obtaining sufficient signal in the brain tissue (FFN246). We demonstrate the utility of FFN246 for direct examination of SERT activity and SERT inhibitors in 96-well cell culture assays, as well as specific labeling of serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus in the living tissue of acute mouse brain slices. While we found only minor FFN246 accumulation in serotonergic axons in murine brain tissue, FFN246 effectively traces serotonin uptake and packaging in the soma of serotonergic neurons with improved photophysical properties and loading parameters compared to known serotonin-based fluorescent tracers.",

        "Abstract": "Few tools are available for noninvasive imaging of synapses in the living mammalian brain. Current paradigms require the use of genetically modified mice or viral delivery of genetic material to the brain. To develop an alternative chemical approach, utilizing the recognition of synaptic components by organic small molecules, we designed an imaging-based, high-content screen in cultured cortical neurons to identify molecules based on their colocalization with fluorescently tagged synaptic proteins. We used this approach to screen a library of \u223c7000 novel fluorescent dyes, and identified a series of compounds in the xanthone family that exhibited consistent synaptic labeling. Follow-up studies with one of these compounds, CX-G3, demonstrated its ability to label acidic organelles and in particular synaptic vesicles at glutamatergic synapses in cultured neurons and murine brain tissue, indicating the potential of this screening approach to identify promising lead compounds for use as synaptic markers, sensors, and targeting devices.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Although mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulated \u03b1-synuclein (aSyn) expression are postulated to play a role in PD pathogenesis, it is still debated why neurons of the SN are targeted while neighboring dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are spared. Using electrochemical and imaging approaches, we investigated metabolic changes in cultured primary mouse midbrain dopaminergic neurons exposed to a parkinsonian neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP",

        "Abstract": "l-DOPA provides highly effective treatment for Parkinson's disease, but l-DOPA induced dyskinesia (LID) is a very debilitating response that eventually is presented by a majority of patients. A central issue in understanding the basis of LID is whether it is due to a response to chronic l-DOPA over years of therapy, and/or due to synaptic changes that follow the loss of dopaminergic neurotransmission and then triggered by acute l-DOPA administration. We review recent work that suggests that specific synaptic changes in the D1 dopamine receptor-expressing direct pathway striatal projection neurons due to loss of dopamine in Parkinson's disease are responsible for LID. Chronic l-DOPA may nevertheless modulate LID through priming mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Disease-modifying treatments remain an unmet medical need in Parkinson's disease (PD). Such treatments can be operationally defined as interventions that slow down the clinical evolution to advanced disease milestones. A treatment may achieve this outcome by either inhibiting primary neurodegenerative events (\"neuroprotection\") or boosting compensatory and regenerative mechanisms in the brain (\"neurorestoration\"). Here we review experimental paradigms that are currently used to assess the neuroprotective and neurorestorative potential of candidate treatments in animal models of PD. We review some key molecular mediators of neuroprotection and neurorestoration in the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway that are likely to exert beneficial effects on multiple neural systems affected in PD. We further review past and current strategies to therapeutically stimulate these mediators, and discuss the preclinical evidence that exercise training can have neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects. A future translational task will be to combine behavioral and pharmacological interventions to exploit endogenous mechanisms of neuroprotection and neurorestoration for therapeutic purposes. This type of approach is likely to provide benefit to many PD patients, despite the clinical, etiological, and genetic heterogeneity of the disease.",

        "Abstract": "The ability of presynaptic dopamine terminals to tune neurotransmitter release to meet the demands of neuronal activity is critical to neurotransmission. Although vesicle content has been assumed to be static, in\u00a0vitro data increasingly suggest that cell activity modulates vesicle content. Here, we use a coordinated genetic, pharmacological, and imaging approach in Drosophila to study the presynaptic machinery responsible for these vesicular processes in\u00a0vivo. We show that cell depolarization increases synaptic vesicle dopamine content prior to release via vesicular hyperacidification. This depolarization-induced hyperacidification is mediated by the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT). Remarkably, both depolarization-induced dopamine vesicle hyperacidification and its dependence on VGLUT2 are seen in ventral midbrain dopamine neurons in the mouse. Together, these data suggest that in response to depolarization, dopamine vesicles utilize a cascade of vesicular transporters to dynamically increase the vesicular pH gradient, thereby increasing dopamine vesicle content.",

Here we show that a defined set of peptides that are derived from \u03b1-synuclein, a protein aggregated in Parkinson's disease, act as antigenic epitopes displayed by these alleles and drive helper and cytotoxic T cell responses in patients with Parkinson's disease. These responses may explain the association of Parkinson's disease with specific major histocompatibility complex alleles.",

        "Title": "Endocannabinoid modulation of dopamine neurotransmission.",
        "Abstract": "Dopamine (DA) is a major catecholamine neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain that controls neural circuits involved in the cognitive, emotional, and motor aspects of goal-directed behavior. Accordingly, perturbations in DA neurotransmission play a central role in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Somewhat surprisingly given its prominent role in numerous behaviors, DA is released by a relatively small number of densely packed neurons originating in the midbrain. The dopaminergic midbrain innervates numerous brain regions where extracellular DA release and receptor binding promote short- and long-term changes in postsynaptic neuron function. Striatal forebrain nuclei receive the greatest proportion of DA projections and are a predominant hub at which DA influences behavior. A number of excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory inputs orchestrate DA neurotransmission by controlling DA cell body firing patterns, terminal release, and effects on postsynaptic sites in the striatum. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system serves as an important filter of afferent input that acts locally at midbrain and terminal regions to shape how incoming information is conveyed onto DA neurons and to output targets. In this review, we aim to highlight existing knowledge regarding how eCB signaling controls DA neuron function through modifications in synaptic strength at midbrain and striatal sites, and to raise outstanding questions on this topic.

        "Abstract": "Dopamine neurotransmission in the dorsal hippocampus is critical for a range of functions from spatial learning and synaptic plasticity to the deficits underlying psychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is the presumed source of dopamine in the dorsal hippocampus. However, there is a surprising scarcity of VTA dopamine axons in the dorsal hippocampus despite the dense network of dopamine receptors. We have explored this apparent paradox using optogenetic, biochemical, and behavioral approaches and found that dopaminergic axons and subsequent dopamine release in the dorsal hippocampus originate from neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC). Photostimulation of LC axons produced an increase in dopamine release in the dorsal hippocampus as revealed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Furthermore, optogenetically induced release of dopamine from the LC into the dorsal hippocampus enhanced selective attention and spatial object recognition via the dopamine D1/D5 receptor. These results suggest that spatial learning and memory are energized by the release of dopamine in the dorsal hippocampus from noradrenergic neurons of the LC. The present findings are critical for identifying the neural circuits that enable proper attention selection and successful learning and memory.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the selective loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra; however, the mechanism of neurodegeneration in PD remains unclear. A subset of familial PD is linked to mutations in PARK2 and PINK1, which lead to dysfunctional mitochondria-related proteins Parkin and PINK1, suggesting that pathways implicated in these monogenic forms could play a more general role in PD. We demonstrate that the identification of disease-related phenotypes in PD-patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons depends on the type of differentiation protocol utilized. In a floor-plate-based but not a neural-rosette-based directed differentiation strategy, iPSC-derived mDA neurons recapitulate PD phenotypes, including pathogenic protein accumulation, cell-type-specific vulnerability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and abnormal neurotransmitter homeostasis. We propose that these form a pathogenic loop that contributes to disease. Our study illustrates the promise of iPSC technology for examining PD pathogenesis and identifying therapeutic targets.",

        "Abstract": "Enhanced dopamine (DA) neurotransmission from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the ventral striatum is thought to drive drug self-administration and mediate positive reinforcement. We examined neuronal firing rates in slices of mouse midbrain following adolescent binge-like alcohol drinking and find that prior alcohol experience greatly enhanced the sensitivity to excitation by ethanol itself (10-50\u00a0mM) in a subset of ventral midbrain DA neurons located in the medial VTA. This enhanced response after drinking was not associated with alterations of firing rate or other measures of intrinsic excitability. In addition, the phenomenon appears to be specific to adolescent drinking, as mice that established a drinking preference only after the onset of adulthood showed no change in alcohol sensitivity. Here we demonstrate not only that drinking during adolescence induces enhanced alcohol sensitivity, but also that this DA neuronal response occurs over a range of alcohol concentrations associated with social drinking in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Typical antipsychotics can cause disabling side effects. Specifically, antagonism of D2R signaling by the typical antipsychotic haloperidol induces parkinsonism in humans and catalepsy in rodents. Striatal dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) are major regulators of motor activity through their signaling on striatal projection neurons and interneurons. We show that D2R signaling on cholinergic interneurons contributes to an in\u00a0vitro pause in firing of these otherwise tonically active neurons and to the striatal dopamine/acetylcholine balance. The selective ablation of D2R from cholinergic neurons allows discrimination between the motor-reducing and cataleptic effects of antipsychotics. The cataleptic effect of antipsychotics is triggered by blockade of D2R on cholinergic interneurons and the consequent increase of acetylcholine signaling on striatal projection neurons. These studies illuminate the critical role of D2R-mediated signaling in regulating\u00a0the activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons and\u00a0the mechanisms of typical antipsychotic side effects.",

        "Abstract": "Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSCs) are the promising device for electricity generation. However, the initial stage in which an electron is injected from a dye to the semiconductor has not been precisely understood. Standard quantum chemistry methods cannot handle infinite number of orbitals coming from the band structure of the semiconductor, whereas solid state calculations cannot handle many excited states at a reasonable computational cost. In this regard, we propose a new method to evaluate lifetimes of many excited states of a molecule on a semi-infinite surface. On the basis of the theory of resonance state, the effect of the semi-infinite semiconductor is encoded into the complex self-energy from surface Green's function. The lifetimes of excited states are evaluated through the imaginary part of the self-energy, and the self-energy correction is included into excitation energies obtained from time-dependent density functional theory calculations. This new method is applied to a DSSC system composed of black dye attached to the TiO2 semiconductor, and the computed lifetimes are linked to the natures of excited states and to the surface properties. The present method provides the firm ground for analysis of interplay between many excited states of the dye and band structure of the semiconductor.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine (DA) transmission is governed by processes that regulate release from axonal boutons in the forebrain and the somatodendritic compartment in midbrain, and by clearance by the DA transporter, diffusion, and extracellular metabolism. We review how axonal DA release is regulated by neuronal activity and by autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, and address how quantal release events are regulated in size and frequency. In brain regions densely innervated by DA axons, DA clearance is due predominantly to uptake by the DA transporter, whereas in cortex, midbrain, and other regions with relatively sparse DA inputs, the norepinephrine transporter and diffusion are involved. We discuss the role of DA uptake in restricting the sphere of influence of DA and in temporal accumulation of extracellular DA levels upon successive action potentials. The tonic discharge activity of DA neurons may be translated into a tonic extracellular DA level, whereas their bursting activity can generate discrete extracellular DA transients.",

        "Abstract": "Neurotransmission at dopaminergic synapses has been studied with techniques that provide high temporal resolution, but cannot resolve individual synapses. To elucidate the spatial dynamics and heterogeneity of individual dopamine boutons, we developed fluorescent false neurotransmitter 200 (FFN200), a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) substrate that selectively traces monoamine exocytosis in both neuronal cell culture and brain tissue. By monitoring electrically evoked Ca(2+) transients with GCaMP3 and FFN200 release simultaneously, we found that only a small fraction of dopamine boutons that exhibited Ca(2+) influx engaged in exocytosis, a result confirmed with activity-dependent loading of the endocytic probe FM1-43. Thus, only a low fraction of striatal dopamine axonal sites with uptake-competent VMAT2 vesicles are capable of transmitter release. This is consistent with the presence of functionally 'silent' dopamine vesicle clusters and represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first report suggestive of presynaptically silent neuromodulatory synapses.",

        "Abstract": "Amphetamines elevate extracellular dopamine, but the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. Here we show in rodents that acute pharmacological inhibition of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) blocks amphetamine-induced locomotion and self-administration without impacting cocaine-induced behaviours. To study VMAT's role in mediating amphetamine action in dopamine neurons, we have used novel genetic, pharmacological and optical approaches in Drosophila melanogaster. In an ex vivo whole-brain preparation, fluorescent reporters of vesicular cargo and of vesicular pH reveal that amphetamine redistributes vesicle contents and diminishes the vesicle pH-gradient responsible for dopamine uptake and retention. This amphetamine-induced deacidification requires VMAT function and results from net H(+) antiport by VMAT out of the vesicle lumen coupled to inward amphetamine transport. Amphetamine-induced vesicle deacidification also requires functional dopamine transporter (DAT) at the plasma membrane. Thus, we find that at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, amphetamines must be actively transported by DAT and VMAT in tandem to produce psychostimulant effects.",

        "Abstract": "In addition to the appearance of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by aberrant lipid metabolism and early mitochondrial dysfunction. We recently showed that there was increased functionality of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAM), a subdomain of the ER involved in lipid and cholesterol homeostasis, in presenilin-deficient cells and in fibroblasts from familial and sporadic AD patients. Individuals carrying the \u03b54 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE4) are at increased risk for developing AD compared to those carrying ApoE3. While the reason for this increased risk is unknown, we hypothesized that it might be associated with elevated MAM function. Using an astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM) model, we now show that ER-mitochondrial communication and MAM function-as measured by the synthesis of phospholipids and of cholesteryl esters, respectively-are increased significantly in cells treated with ApoE4-containing ACM as compared to those treated with ApoE3-containing ACM. Notably, this effect was seen with lipoprotein-enriched preparations, but not with lipid-free ApoE protein. These data are consistent with a role of upregulated MAM function in the pathogenesis of AD and may help explain, in part, the contribution of ApoE4 as a risk factor in the disease.",

        "Title": "Loss of VGLUT3 Produces Circadian-Dependent Hyperdopaminergia and Ameliorates Motor Dysfunction and l-Dopa-Mediated Dyskinesias in a Model of Parkinson's Disease.",
        "Abstract": "The striatum is essential for many aspects of mammalian behavior, including motivation and movement, and is dysfunctional in motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3) is expressed by striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) and is thus well positioned to regulate dopamine (DA) signaling and locomotor activity, a canonical measure of basal ganglia output. We now report that VGLUT3 knock-out (KO) mice show circadian-dependent hyperlocomotor activity that is restricted to the waking cycle and is due to an increase in striatal DA synthesis, packaging, and release. Using a conditional VGLUT3 KO mouse, we show that deletion of the transporter from CINs, surprisingly, does not alter evoked DA release in the dorsal striatum or baseline locomotor activity. The mice do, however, display changes in rearing behavior and sensorimotor gating. Elevation of DA release in the global KO raised the possibility that motor deficits in a Parkinson's disease model would be reduced. Remarkably, after a partial 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-mediated DA depletion (\u223c70% in dorsal striatum), KO mice, in contrast to WT mice, showed normal motor behavior across the entire circadian cycle. l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine-mediated dyskinesias were also significantly attenuated. These findings thus point to new mechanisms to regulate basal ganglia function and potentially treat Parkinson's disease and related disorders.",

        "Title": "Interactions of iron, dopamine and neuromelanin pathways in brain aging and Parkinson's disease.",
        "Abstract": "There are several interrelated mechanisms involving iron, dopamine, and neuromelanin in neurons. Neuromelanin accumulates during aging and is the catecholamine-derived pigment of the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra and norepinephrine neurons of the locus coeruleus, the two neuronal populations most targeted in Parkinson's disease. Many cellular redox reactions rely on iron, however an altered distribution of reactive iron is cytotoxic. In fact, increased levels of iron in the brain of Parkinson's disease patients are present. Dopamine accumulation can induce neuronal death; however, excess dopamine can be removed by converting it into a stable compound like neuromelanin, and this process rescues the cell. Interestingly, the main iron compound in dopamine and norepinephrine neurons is the neuromelanin-iron complex, since neuromelanin is an effective metal chelator. Neuromelanin serves to trap iron and provide neuronal protection from oxidative stress. This equilibrium between iron, dopamine, and neuromelanin is crucial for cell homeostasis and in some cellular circumstances can be disrupted. Indeed, when neuromelanin-containing organelles accumulate high load of toxins and iron during aging a neurodegenerative process can be triggered. In addition, neuromelanin released by degenerating neurons activates microglia and the latter cause neurons death with further release of neuromelanin, then starting a self-propelling mechanism of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Considering the above issues, age-related accumulation of neuromelanin in dopamine neurons shows an interesting link between aging and neurodegeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) causes hypokinesia, but DA replacement therapy can elicit exaggerated voluntary and involuntary behaviors that have been attributed to enhanced DA receptor sensitivity in striatal projection neurons. Here we reveal that in hemiparkinsonian mice, striatal D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs) directly projecting to the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) lose tonic presynaptic inhibition by GABAB receptors. The absence of presynaptic GABAB response potentiates evoked GABA release from MSN efferents to the SNr and drives motor sensitization. This alternative mechanism of sensitization suggests a synaptic target for PD pharmacotherapy.",

        "Title": "Changes in neuronal dopamine homeostasis following 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) exposure.",
        "Abstract": "1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)), the active metabolite of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, selectively kills dopaminergic neurons in vivo and in vitro via a variety of toxic mechanisms, including mitochondrial dysfunction, generation of peroxynitrite, induction of apoptosis, and oxidative stress due to disruption of vesicular dopamine (DA) storage. To investigate the effects of acute MPP(+) exposure on neuronal DA homeostasis, we measured stimulation-dependent DA release and non-exocytotic DA efflux from mouse striatal slices and extracellular, intracellular, and cytosolic DA (DAcyt) levels in cultured mouse ventral midbrain neurons. In acute striatal slices, MPP(+) exposure gradually decreased stimulation-dependent DA release, followed by massive DA efflux that was dependent on MPP(+) concentration, temperature, and DA uptake transporter activity. Similarly, in mouse midbrain neuronal cultures, MPP(+) depleted vesicular DA storage accompanied by an elevation of cytosolic and extracellular DA levels. In neuronal cell bodies, increased DAcyt was not due to transmitter leakage from synaptic vesicles but rather to competitive MPP(+)-dependent inhibition of monoamine oxidase activity. Accordingly, monoamine oxidase blockers pargyline and l-deprenyl had no effect on DAcyt levels in MPP(+)-treated cells and produced only a moderate effect on the survival of dopaminergic neurons treated with the toxin. In contrast, depletion of intracellular DA by blocking neurotransmitter synthesis resulted in \u223c30% reduction of MPP(+)-mediated toxicity, whereas overexpression of VMAT2 completely rescued dopaminergic neurons. These results demonstrate the utility of comprehensive analysis of DA metabolism using various electrochemical methods and reveal the complexity of the effects of MPP(+) on neuronal DA homeostasis and neurotoxicity.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have shown evidence of behavioral recovery after transplantation of human pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived neural cells in animal models of neurological disease. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying graft function. Here we use optogenetics to modulate in real time electrophysiological and neurochemical properties of mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). In mice that had recovered from lesion-induced Parkinsonian motor deficits, light-induced selective silencing of graft activity rapidly and reversibly re-introduced the motor deficits. The re-introduction of motor deficits was prevented by the dopamine agonist apomorphine. These results suggest that functionality depends on graft neuronal activity and dopamine release. Combining optogenetics, slice electrophysiology and pharmacological approaches, we further show that mesDA-rich grafts modulate host glutamatergic synaptic transmission onto striatal medium spiny neurons in a manner reminiscent of endogenous mesDA neurons. Thus, application of optogenetics in cell therapy can link transplantation, animal behavior and postmortem analysis to enable the identification of mechanisms that drive recovery.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has been attributed to a combination of genetic and nongenetic factors. We studied a set of monozygotic twins harboring the heterozygous glucocerebrosidase mutation (GBA N370S) but clinically discordant for PD. We applied induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology for PD disease modeling using the twins' fibroblasts to evaluate and dissect the genetic and nongenetic contributions. Utilizing fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we obtained a homogenous population of \"footprint-free\" iPSC-derived midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. The mDA neurons from both twins had \u223c50% GBA enzymatic activity, \u223c3-fold elevated \u03b1-synuclein protein levels, and a reduced capacity to synthesize and release dopamine. Interestingly, the affected twin's neurons showed an even lower dopamine level, increased monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) expression, and impaired intrinsic network activity. Overexpression of wild-type GBA and treatment with MAO-B inhibitors normalized \u03b1-synuclein and dopamine levels, suggesting a combination therapy for the affected twin.",

We review how this dopamine (DA) precursor enhances dopaminergic transmission by providing a greater sphere of neurotransmitter influence as a result of the confluence of increased quantal size and decreased DA reuptake, as well as loading DA as a false transmitter into surviving serotonin neuron synaptic vesicles. We further review literature on how presynaptic dysregulation of DA release after l-dopa might trigger dyskinesias in PD patients.",

        "Abstract": "The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are due to the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Multiple neuroinflammatory processes are exacerbated in Parkinson's disease, including glial-mediated reactions, increased expression of proinflammatory substances, and lymphocytic infiltration, particularly in the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammation is also implicated in the neurodegeneration and consequent behavioral symptoms of many Parkinson's disease animal models, although it is not clear whether these features emulate pathogenic steps in the genuine disorder or if some inflammatory features provide protective stress responses. Here, we compare and summarize findings on neuroinflammatory responses and effects on behavior in a wide range of toxin-based, inflammatory and genetic Parkinson's disease animal models.",

        "Abstract": "Developmental alterations of excitatory synapses are implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Here, we report increased dendritic spine density with reduced developmental spine pruning in layer V pyramidal neurons in postmortem ASD temporal lobe. These spine deficits correlate with hyperactivated mTOR and impaired autophagy. In Tsc2 \u00b1 ASD mice where mTOR is constitutively overactive, we observed postnatal spine pruning defects, blockade of autophagy, and ASD-like social behaviors. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin corrected ASD-like behaviors and spine pruning defects in Tsc2 \u00b1 mice, but not in Atg7(CKO) neuronal autophagy-deficient mice or Tsc2 \u00b1 :Atg7(CKO) double mutants. Neuronal autophagy furthermore enabled spine elimination with no effects on spine formation. Our findings suggest that mTOR-regulated autophagy is required for developmental spine pruning, and activation of neuronal autophagy corrects synaptic pathology and social behavior deficits in ASD models with hyperactivated mTOR.",

        "Title": "Calcineurin determines toxic versus beneficial responses to \u03b1-synuclein.",
        "Abstract": "Calcineurin (CN) is a highly conserved Ca(2+)-calmodulin (CaM)-dependent phosphatase that senses Ca(2+) concentrations and transduces that information into cellular responses. Ca(2+) homeostasis is disrupted by \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), a small lipid binding protein whose misfolding and accumulation is a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. We report that \u03b1-syn, from yeast to neurons, leads to sustained highly elevated levels of cytoplasmic Ca(2+), thereby activating a CaM-CN cascade that engages substrates that result in toxicity. Surprisingly, complete inhibition of CN also results in toxicity. Limiting the availability of CaM shifts CN's spectrum of substrates toward protective pathways. Modulating CN or CN's substrates with highly selective genetic and pharmacological tools (FK506) does the same. FK506 crosses the blood brain barrier, is well tolerated in humans, and is active in neurons and glia. Thus, a tunable response to CN, which has been conserved for a billion years, can be targeted to rebalance the phosphatase's activities from toxic toward beneficial substrates. These findings have immediate therapeutic implications for synucleinopathies.",

        "Abstract": "The ability of dopamine (DA) neurons to release other transmitters in addition to DA itself has been increasingly recognized, hence the concept of their multilingual nature. A subset of DA neurons, mainly found in the ventral tegmental area, express VGLUT2, allowing them to package and release glutamate onto striatal spiny projection neurons and cholinergic interneurons. Some dopaminergic axon terminals release GABA. Glutamate release by DA neurons has a developmental role, facilitating axonal growth and survival, and may determine in part the critical contribution of the ventral striatum to psychostimulant-induced behavior. Vesicular glutamate coentry may have synergistic effects on vesicular DA filling. The multilingual transmission of DA neurons across multiple striatal domains and the increasing insight into the role of glutamate cotransmission in the ventral striatum highlight the importance of analyzing DA neuron transmission at the synaptic level.",

        "Abstract": "Subsets of rodent neurons are reported to express major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), but such expression has not been reported in normal adult human neurons. Here we provide evidence from immunolabel, RNA expression and mass spectrometry analysis of postmortem samples that human catecholaminergic substantia nigra and locus coeruleus neurons express MHC-I, and that this molecule is inducible in human stem cell-derived dopamine (DA) neurons. Catecholamine murine cultured neurons are more responsive to induction of MHC-I by gamma-interferon than other neuronal populations. Neuronal MHC-I is also induced by factors released from microglia activated by neuromelanin or alpha-synuclein, or high cytosolic DA and/or oxidative stress. DA neurons internalize foreign ovalbumin and display antigen derived from this protein by MHC-I, which triggers DA neuronal death in the presence of appropriate cytotoxic T cells. Thus, neuronal MHC-I can trigger antigenic response, and catecholamine neurons may be particularly susceptible to T-cell-mediated cytotoxic attack.",

        "Title": "M5 receptor activation produces opposing physiological outcomes in dopamine neurons depending on the receptor's location.",
        "Abstract": "Of the five muscarinic receptor subtypes, the M5 receptor is the only one detectable in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, making it an attractive potential therapeutic target for treating disorders in which dopaminergic signaling is disrupted. However, developing an understanding of the role of M5 in regulating midbrain dopamine neuron function has been hampered by a lack of subtype-selective compounds. Here, we extensively characterize the novel compound VU0238429 and demonstrate that it acts as a positive allosteric modulator with unprecedented selectivity for the M5 receptor. We then used VU0238429, along with M5 knock-out mice, to elucidate the role of this receptor in regulating substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) neuron physiology in both mice and rats. In sagittal brain slices that isolate the SNc soma from their striatal terminals, activation of muscarinic receptors induced Ca2+ mobilization and inward currents in SNc dopamine neurons, both of which were potentiated by VU0238429 and absent in M5 knock-out mice. Activation of M5 also increased the spontaneous firing rate of SNc neurons, suggesting that activation of somatodendritic M5 increases the intrinsic excitability of SNc neurons. However, in coronal slices of the striatum, potentiation of M5 with VU0238429 resulted in an inhibition in dopamine release as monitored with fast scan cyclic voltammetry. Accordingly, activation of M5 can lead to opposing physiological outcomes depending on the location of the receptor. Although activation of somatodendritic M5 receptors on SNc neurons leads to increased neuronal firing, activation of M5 receptors in the striatum induces an inhibition in dopamine release.",

        "Abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra selectively degenerate over the course of Parkinson's disease. These neurons are also the most heavily pigmented cells of the brain, accumulating the dark pigment neuromelanin over a lifetime. The massive presence of neuromelanin in these brain areas has long been suspected as a key factor involved in the selective vulnerability of neurons. The high concentration of neuromelanin in substantia nigra neurons seems to be linked to the presence of considerable amounts of cytosolic dopamine that have not been sequestered into synaptic vesicles. Over the past few years, studies have uncovered a dual nature of neuromelanin. Intraneuronal neuromelanin can be a protective factor, shielding the cells from toxic effects of redox active metals, toxins, and excess of cytosolic catecholamines. In contrast, neuromelanin released by dying neurons can contribute to the activation of neuroglia triggering the neuroinflammation that characterizes Parkinson's disease. This article reviews recent studies on the molecular aspects of neuromelanin of the human substantia nigra.",

To test whether this mechanism was relevant to axon regrowth in adult animals, we examined the reinnervation of dorsal striatum following nigral dopamine neuron loss induced by unilateral intrastriatal injections of the toxin 6-hydroxydopamine. We used a pharmacological approach to enhance NMDA receptor-dependent signaling by treatment with an inhibitor of glycine transporter-1 that elevates levels of extracellular glycine, a coagonist required for NMDA receptor activation. All mice displayed sprouting of dopaminergic axons from spared fibers in the ventral striatum to the denervated dorsal striatum at 7 weeks post-lesion, but the reinnervation in mice treated for 4 weeks with glycine uptake inhibitor was approximately twice as dense as in untreated mice. The treated mice also displayed higher levels of striatal dopamine and a complete recovery from lateralization in a test of sensorimotor behavior. We confirmed that the actions of glycine uptake inhibition on reinnervation and behavioral recovery required NMDA receptors in dopamine neurons using targeted deletion of the NR1 NMDA receptor subunit in dopamine neurons. Glycine transport inhibitors promote functionally relevant sprouting of surviving dopamine axons and could provide clinical treatment for disorders such as Parkinson's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is an essential component of the monoaminergic neurotransmission system in the brain as it transports monoamine neurotransmitters from the neuronal cytosol into the synaptic vesicles and thus contributes to modulation of neurotransmitter release. Considering the continuing interest in VMAT2 as a drug target, as well as a target for the design of imaging probes, we have developed a fluorescent substrate well suited for the study of VMAT2 in cell culture. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a new fluorescent probe, FFN206, as an excellent VMAT2 substrate capable of detecting VMAT2 activity in intact cells using fluorescence microscopy, with subcellular localization to VMAT2-expressing acidic compartments without apparent labeling of other organelles. VMAT2 activity can also be measured via microplate reader. The apparent Km of FFN206 at VMAT2 was found to be 1.16 \u00b1 0.10 \u03bcM, similar to that of dopamine. We further report the development and validation of a cell-based fluorescence assay amenable to high-throughput screening (HTS) using VMAT2-transfected HEK cells (Z'-factor of 0.7-0.8), enabling rapid identification of VMAT2 inhibitors and measurement of their inhibition constants over a broad range of affinities. FFN206 thus represents a new tool for optical examination of VMAT2 function in cell culture.",

        "Title": "APP+, a fluorescent analogue of the neurotoxin MPP+, is a marker of catecholamine neurons in brain tissue, but not a fluorescent false neurotransmitter.",
        "Abstract": "We have previously introduced fluorescent false neurotransmitters (FFNs) as optical reporters that enable visualization of individual dopaminergic presynaptic terminals and their activity in the brain. In this context, we examined the fluorescent pyridinium dye 4-(4-dimethylamino)phenyl-1-methylpyridinium (APP+), a fluorescent analogue of the dopaminergic neurotoxin MPP+, in acute mouse brain tissue. APP+ is a substrate for the dopamine transporter (DAT), norepinephrine transporter (NET), and serotonin transporter (SERT), and as such represented a candidate for the development of new FFN probes. Here we report that APP+ labels cell bodies of catecholaminergic neurons in the midbrain in a DAT- and NET-dependent manner, as well as fine dopaminergic axonal processes in the dorsal striatum. APP+ destaining from presynaptic terminals in the dorsal striatum was also examined under the conditions inducing depolarization and exocytotic neurotransmitter release. Application of KCl led to a small but significant degree of destaining (approximately 15% compared to control), which stands in contrast to a nearly complete destaining of the new generation FFN agent, FFN102. Electrical stimulation of brain slices at 10 Hz afforded no significant change in the APP+ signal. These results indicate that the majority of the APP+ signal in axonal processes originates from labeled organelles including mitochondria, whereas only a minor component of the APP+ signal represents the releasable synaptic vesicular pool. These results also show that APP+ may serve as a useful probe for identifying catecholaminergic innervations in the brain, although it is a poor candidate for the development of FFNs.",

        "Abstract": "Although there have been significant advances, pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease (PD) is still poorly understood. Potential clues about pathogenesis that have not been systematically pursued are suggested by the restricted pattern of neuronal pathology in the disease. In addition to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), a significant number of other central and peripheral neuronal populations exhibit Lewy pathology (LP), phenotypic dysregulation, or frank degeneration in PD patients. Drawing on this literature, there appears to be a small number of risk factors contributing to vulnerability. These include autonomous activity, broad action potentials, low intrinsic calcium buffering capacity, poorly myelinated long highly branched axons and terminal fields, and use of a catecholamine neurotransmitter, often with the catecholamine-derived neuromelanin pigment. Of these phenotypic traits, only the physiological ones appear to provide a reachable therapeutic target at present.",

        "Title": "Lingo-1 expression is increased in essential tremor cerebellum and is present in the basket cell pinceau.",
        "Abstract": "The Lingo-1 sequence variant has been associated with essential tremor (ET) in several genome-wide association studies. However, the role that Lingo-1 might play in pathogenesis of ET is not understood. Since Lingo-1 protein is a negative regulator of axonal regeneration and neurite outgrowth, it could contribute to Purkinje cell (PC) or basket cell axonal pathology observed in postmortem studies of ET brains. In this study, we used Western blotting and immunohistochemistry to examine Lingo-1 protein in ET vs. control brains. In Western blots, Lingo-1 protein expression level was significantly increased in cerebellar cortex (1.56 \u00b1 0.46 in ET cases vs. 0.99 \u00b1 0.20 in controls, p = 0.002), but was similar in the occipital cortex (p = 1.00) of ET cases vs. controls. Lingo-1 immunohistochemistry in cerebellum revealed that Lingo-1 was enriched in the distal axonal processes of basket cells, which formed a \"pinceau\" structure around the PC axon initial segment (AIS). We found that some Lingo-1-positive pinceau had abnormally elongated processes, targeting PC axon segments distal to the AIS. In ET cases, the percentage of Lingo-1-positive pinceau that were \u226530 or \u226540 \u03bcm in length was increased 2.4- to 4.1-fold, respectively, vs. pinceau seen in control brains (p < 0.0001). Elongated Lingo-1-positive pinceau strongly correlated with number of PC axonal torpedoes and a rating of basket cell axonal pathology. The increased cerebellar Lingo-1 expression and elongated Lingo-1-positive pinceau processes could contribute to the abnormal PC and basket cell axonal pathology and cerebellar dysfunction observed in ET.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of familial Parkinson's disease. We found LRRK2 to be degraded in lysosomes by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), whereas the most common pathogenic mutant form of LRRK2, G2019S, was poorly degraded by this pathway. In contrast to the behavior of typical CMA substrates, lysosomal binding of both wild-type and several pathogenic mutant LRRK2 proteins was enhanced in the presence of other CMA substrates, which interfered with the organization of the CMA translocation complex, resulting in defective CMA. Cells responded to such LRRK2-mediated CMA compromise by increasing levels of the CMA lysosomal receptor, as seen in neuronal cultures and brains of LRRK2 transgenic mice, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons and brains of Parkinson's disease patients with LRRK2 mutations. This newly described LRRK2 self-perpetuating inhibitory effect on CMA could underlie toxicity in Parkinson's disease by compromising the degradation of \u03b1-synuclein, another Parkinson's disease-related protein degraded by this pathway.",

        "Title": "ATF4 protects against neuronal death in cellular Parkinson's disease models by maintaining levels of parkin.",
        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, for which there are no effective disease-modifying therapies. The transcription factor ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4) is induced by multiple PD-relevant stressors, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative damage. ATF4 may exert either protective or deleterious effects on cell survival, depending on the paradigm. However, the role of ATF4 in the pathogenesis of PD has not been explored. We find that ATF4 levels are increased in neuromelanin-positive neurons in the substantia nigra of a subset of PD patients relative to controls. ATF4 levels are also upregulated in neuronal PC12 cells treated with the dopaminergic neuronal toxins 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). To explore the role of ATF4 in cell survival in PD-relevant contexts, we either silenced or overexpressed ATF4 in cellular models of PD. In neuronal PC12 cells, silencing of ATF4 enhanced cell death in response to either 6-OHDA or MPP+. Conversely, overexpression of ATF4 reduced cell death caused by dopaminergic neuronal toxins. ATF4 was also protective against 6-OHDA-induced death of cultured mouse ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons. We further show that parkin, a gene associated with autosomal recessive PD, plays a critical role in ATF4-mediated protection. After treatment with 6-OHDA or MPP+, parkin protein levels fall, despite an increase in mRNA levels. ATF4 silencing exacerbates the toxin-induced reduction of parkin, whereas ATF4 overexpression partially preserves parkin levels. Finally, parkin silencing blocked the protective capacity of ATF4. These results indicate that ATF4 plays a protective role in PD through the regulation of parkin.",

        "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) consists of a group of complex developmental disabilities characterized by impaired social interactions, deficits in communication and repetitive behavior. Multiple lines of evidence implicate mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD. In postmortem BA21 temporal cortex, a region that exhibits synaptic pathology in ASD, we found that compared to controls, ASD patients exhibited altered protein levels of mitochondria respiratory chain protein complexes, decreased Complex I and IV activities, decreased mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme SOD2, and greater oxidative DNA damage. Mitochondrial membrane mass was higher in ASD brain, as indicated by higher protein levels of mitochondrial membrane proteins Tom20, Tim23 and porin. No differences were observed in either mitochondrial DNA or levels of the mitochondrial gene transcription factor TFAM or cofactor PGC1\u03b1, indicating that a mechanism other than alterations in mitochondrial genome or mitochondrial biogenesis underlies these mitochondrial abnormalities. We further identified higher levels of the mitochondrial fission proteins (Fis1 and Drp1) and decreased levels of the fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and Opa1) in ASD patients, indicating altered mitochondrial dynamics in ASD brain. Many of these changes were evident in cortical pyramidal neurons, and were observed in ASD children but were less pronounced or absent in adult patients. Together, these findings provide evidence that mitochondrial function and intracellular redox status are compromised in pyramidal neurons in ASD brain and that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs during early childhood when ASD symptoms appear.",

        "Abstract": "An under-appreciated clue about pathogenesis in Parkinson disease (PD) is the distribution of pathology in the early and middle stages of the disease. This pathological 'roadmap' shows that in addition to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), a significant number of other central and peripheral neuronal populations exhibit Lewy pathology, phenotypic dysregulation or frank degeneration in PD patients. This spatially distributed, at-risk population of neurons shares a number of features, including autonomously generated activity, broad action potentials, low intrinsic calcium buffering capacity and long, poorly myelinated, highly branched axons. Many, and perhaps all, of these traits add to the metabolic burden in these neurons, suggesting that mitochondrial deficits could drive pathogenesis in PD-in agreement with a large segment of the literature. What is less clear is how this neuronal phenotype might shape the susceptibility to proteostatic dysfunction or to the spread of \u03b1-synuclein fibrils deposited in the extracellular space. The review explores the literature on these issues and their translational implications.",

        "Abstract": "Macroautophagy is a cellular mechanism for the clearance of protein aggregates and damaged organelles. Impaired macroautophagy has been observed in neurodegenerative disorders. We investigated the macroautophagy pathway in essential tremor (ET) cases compared to age-matched controls. We analyzed microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II), S6K, phosphorylated S6K, beclin-1, and mitochondrial membrane proteins levels by Western blot in the post-mortem cerebellum of 10 ET cases and 11 controls. We also performed immunohistochemistry in 12 ET cases and 13 controls to quantify LC3 clustering in Purkinje cells (PCs). LC3-II protein levels were significantly lower in ET cases vs. controls on Western blot (0.84 \u00b1 0.14 vs. 1.00 \u00b1 0.14, p = 0.02), and LC3-II clustering in PCs by immunohistochemistry was significantly lower in ET cases vs. controls (2.03 \u00b1 3.45 vs. 8.80 \u00b1 9.81, p = 0.03). In ET cases, disease duration was inversely correlated with LC3-II protein level (r = -0.64, p = 0.046). We found that mitochondrial membrane proteins were accumulated in ET (TIM23: 1.36 \u00b1 0.11 in ET cases vs. 1.00 \u00b1 0.08 in controls, p = 0.02; TOMM20: 1.63 \u00b1 0.87 in ET cases vs. 1.00 \u00b1 0.14 in controls, p = 0.03). Beclin-1, which is involved in macroautophagy, was strikingly deficient in ET (0.42 \u00b1 0.13 vs. 1.00 \u00b1 0.35, p<0.001). Decreased macroautophagy was observed in the ET cerebellum, and this could be due to a decrease in beclin-1 levels, which subsequently lead to mitochondrial accumulation as a result of autophagic failure. This provides a possible means by which perturbed macroautophagy could contribute to PC pathology in ET.",

        "Abstract": "We recently introduced fluorescent false neurotransmitters (FFNs) as optical tracers that enable the visualization of neurotransmitter release at individual presynaptic terminals. Here, we describe a pH-responsive FFN probe, FFN102, which as a polar dopamine transporter substrate selectively labels dopamine cell bodies and dendrites in ventral midbrain and dopaminergic synaptic terminals in dorsal striatum. FFN102 exhibits greater fluorescence emission in neutral than acidic environments, and thus affords a means to optically measure evoked release of synaptic vesicle content into the extracellular space. Simultaneously, FFN102 allows the measurement of individual synaptic terminal activity by following fluorescence loss upon stimulation. Thus, FFN102 enables not only the identification of dopamine cells and their processes in brain tissue, but also the optical measurement of functional parameters including dopamine transporter activity and dopamine release at the level of individual synapses. As such, the development of FFN102 demonstrates that, by bringing together organic chemistry and neuroscience, molecular entities can be generated that match the endogenous transmitters in selectivity and distribution, allowing for the study of both the microanatomy and functional plasticity of the normal and diseased nervous system.",

        "Title": "Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy.",
        "Abstract": "In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field.",

        "Abstract": "Although there have been significant advances, pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease (PD) is still poorly understood. Potential clues about pathogenesis that have not been systematically pursued are suggested by the restricted pattern of neuronal pathology in the disease. In addition to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), a significant number of other central and peripheral neuronal populations exhibit Lewy pathology (LP), phenotypic dysregulation, or frank degeneration in PD patients. Drawing on this literature, there appear to be a small number of risk factors contributing to vulnerability. These include autonomous activity, broad action potentials, low intrinsic calcium-buffering capacity, poorly myelinated long highly branched axons and terminal fields, and use of a monoamine neurotransmitter, often with the catecholamine-derived neuromelanin pigment. Of these phenotypic traits, only the physiological ones appear to provide a reachable therapeutic target at present.",

        "Abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) has been implicated in regulating synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration, but MTOR's role in modulating presynaptic function through autophagy is unexplored. We studied presynaptic function in ventral dopamine neurons, a system from which neurotransmitter release can be measured directly by cyclic voltammetry. We generated mutant mice that were specifically deficient for macroautophagy in dopaminergic neurons by deleting the Atg7 gene in cells that express the dopamine uptake transporter. Dopamine axonal profiles in the mutant dorsal striatum were ~one third larger in the mutant mice, released ~50% more stimulus-evoked dopamine release, and exhibited more rapid presynaptic recovery than controls. Rapamycin reduced dopamine neuron axon profile size by ~30% in control mice, but had no effect on macroautophagy deficient axons. Acute rapamycin decreased dopaminergic synaptic vesicle density by ~25% and inhibited evoked dopamine release by ~25% in control mice, but not in the Atg7 deficient mutants. Thus, both basal and induced macroautophagy can provide a brake on presynaptic activity in vivo, perhaps by regulating the turnover of synaptic vesicles, and further regulates terminal volume and the kinetics of transmitter release.",

        "Title": "Dual control of dopamine synthesis and release by presynaptic and postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptors.",
        "Abstract": "Dysfunctions of dopaminergic homeostasis leading to either low or high dopamine (DA) levels are causally linked to Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and addiction. Major sites of DA synthesis are the mesencephalic neurons originating in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area; these structures send major projections to the dorsal striatum (DSt) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc), respectively. DA finely tunes its own synthesis and release by activating DA D2 receptors (D2R). To date, this critical D2R-dependent function was thought to be solely due to activation of D2Rs on dopaminergic neurons (D2 autoreceptors); instead, using site-specific D2R knock-out mice, we uncover that D2 heteroreceptors located on non-DAergic medium spiny neurons participate in the control of DA levels. This D2 heteroreceptor-mediated mechanism is more efficient in the DSt than in NAcc, indicating that D2R signaling differentially regulates mesolimbic- versus nigrostriatal-mediated functions. This study reveals previously unappreciated control of DA signaling, shedding new light on region-specific regulation of DA-mediated effects.",

        "Abstract": "Striatal dopamine neurotransmission is critical for normal voluntary movement, affect and cognition. Dysfunctions of its regulation are implicated in a broad range of behaviors and disorders including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and drug abuse. Extracellular dopamine levels result from a dynamic equilibrium between release and reuptake by dopaminergic terminals. Both processes are regulated by multiple mechanisms. Here we review data characterizing how dopamine levels are regulated by presynaptic autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, an area intensively investigated due to advances in real time electrochemical detection of extracellular dopamine, i.e., fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and amperometry, and the development of mutant mouse lines with deletions for specific receptors.",

        "Abstract": "The study of dopamine (DA) quantal size, or the amount of transmitter released per vesicle fusion event, has been enabled by subsecond resolution amperometric recordings. These methods, together with other electrophysiology techniques, novel optical approaches and classical molecular biology and biochemistry methodologies, have advanced our understanding of quantal size regulation in dopaminergic and other catecholaminergic systems. The presynaptic mechanisms that determine DA quantal size regulate two features: the amount of transmitter stored in each vesicle and the fraction of vesicular contents that are released per fusion event. The amount of vesicular DA is dependent on DA synthesis, DA vesicular loading and storage and on DA reuptake from the extracellular space upon exocytosis. The mode of vesicle fusion and the related fusion pore dynamics control the fraction of DA released per fusion event. We will summarize current understanding on the regulation of these steps by endogenous and exogenous factors, including drugs of abuse and DA itself.",

        "Abstract": "mTOR is a regulator of cell growth and survival, protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity, and autophagic degradation of cellular components. When triggered by mTOR inactivation, macroautophagy degrades long-lived proteins and organelles via\u00a0sequestration into autophagic vacuoles. mTOR further regulates synaptic plasticity, and neurodegeneration occurs when macroautophagy is deficient. It is nevertheless unknown whether macroautophagy modulates presynaptic function. We find that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin induces formation of autophagic vacuoles in prejunctional dopaminergic axons with associated decreased axonal profile volumes, synaptic vesicle numbers, and evoked dopamine release. Evoked dopamine secretion was enhanced and recovery was accelerated in\u00a0transgenic mice in which macroautophagy deficiency was restricted to dopaminergic neurons; rapamycin failed to decrease evoked dopamine release in the striatum of these mice. Macroautophagy that follows mTOR inhibition in presynaptic terminals, therefore, rapidly alters presynaptic structure and neurotransmission.",

        "Abstract": "Autophagy contributes to the removal of prone-to-aggregate proteins, but in several instances these pathogenic proteins have been shown to interfere with autophagic activity. In the case of Huntington's disease (HD), a congenital neurodegenerative disorder resulting from mutation in the huntingtin protein, we have previously described that the mutant protein interferes with the ability of autophagic vacuoles to recognize cytosolic cargo. Growing evidence supports the existence of cross talk among autophagic pathways, suggesting the possibility of functional compensation when one of them is compromised. In this study, we have identified a compensatory upregulation of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in different cellular and mouse models of HD. Components of CMA, namely the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A) and lysosomal-hsc70, are markedly increased in HD models. The increase in LAMP-2A is achieved through both an increase in the stability of this protein at the lysosomal membrane and transcriptional upregulation of this splice variant of the lamp-2 gene. We propose that CMA activity increases in response to macroautophagic dysfunction in the early stages of HD, but that the efficiency of this compensatory mechanism may decrease with age and so contribute to cellular failure and the onset of pathological manifestations.",

We obtain a magnetically balanced basis by a simple scheme where orbitals obtained by imposing restricted kinetic balance are extended by their unrestricted kinetic balance complement. The presented methodology makes it possible to analyze the concept of aromaticity based on the ring current criterion for closed-shell molecules across the periodic table and is independent of the choice of gauge origin. As a first illustration of the methodology we study plots of the magnetically induced current density and its divergence in the series C(5)H(5)E (E = CH, N, P, As, Sb, Bi) at the Kohn-Sham level, as well as integrated ring current susceptibilities, which we compare to previous results (R. Bast et al., Chem. Phys., 2009, 356, 187) obtained using a common gauge origin approach. We find that the current strength decreases monotonically along the series, but that all molecules qualify as aromatic according to the ring current criterion.",

        "Abstract": "Optical imaging is a valuable tool for investigating alterations in membrane turnover and vesicle trafficking. Established techniques can easily be adapted to study the mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction in models of neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, such as drug addiction, Parkinsonism, and Huntington's disease. Fluorescent endocytic tracers, including FM1-43, have been used to optically monitor synaptic vesicle fusion and measure synaptic function in various preparations, including chromaffin cells, dissociated cell cultures, and brain slices. In this chapter, we describe a technique that provides a direct measure of pathway-specific exocytosis from glutamatergic corticostriatal terminals.",

        "Abstract": "The fundamental principle that unites addictive drugs appears to be that each enhances synaptic dopamine by means that dissociate it from normal behavioral control, so that they act to reinforce their own acquisition. This occurs via the modulation of synaptic mechanisms that can be involved in learning, including enhanced excitation or disinhibition of dopamine neuron activity, blockade of dopamine reuptake, and altering the state of the presynaptic terminal to enhance evoked over basal transmission. Amphetamines offer an exception to such modulation in that they combine multiple effects to produce nonexocytic stimulation-independent release of neurotransmitter via reverse transport independent from normal presynaptic function. Questions about the molecular actions of\u00a0addictive drugs, prominently including the actions of alcohol and solvents, remain unresolved, but their ability to co-opt normal presynaptic functions helps to explain why treatment for addiction has been challenging.",

        "Abstract": "Of the five mammalian muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors, M(5) is the only subtype expressed in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, where it functions to potentiate dopamine release. We have identified a direct physical interaction between M(5) and the AP-3 adaptor complex regulator AGAP1. This interaction was specific with regard to muscarinic receptor (MR) and AGAP subtypes, and mediated the binding of AP-3 to M(5). Interaction with AGAP1 and activity of AP-3 were required for the endocytic recycling of M(5) in neurons, the lack of which resulted in the downregulation of cell surface receptor density after sustained receptor stimulation. The elimination of AP-3 or abrogation of AGAP1-M(5) interaction in vivo decreased the magnitude of presynaptic M(5)-mediated dopamine release potentiation in the striatum. Our study argues for the presence of a previously unknown receptor-recycling pathway that may underlie mechanisms of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) homeostasis. These results also suggest a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of dopaminergic dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "We introduce pH-responsive fluorescent false neurotransmitters (pH-responsive FFNs) as novel probes that act as vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) substrates and ratiometric fluorescent pH sensors. The development of these agents was achieved by systematic molecular design that integrated several structural elements, including the aminoethyl group (VMAT recognition), halogenated hydroxy-coumarin core (ratiometric optical pH sensing in the desired pH range), and N- or C-alkylation (modulation of lipophilicity). Of 14 compounds that were synthesized, the probe Mini202 was selected based on the highest uptake in VMAT2-transfected HEK cells and desirable optical properties. Using Mini202, we measured the pH of catecholamine secretory vesicles in PC-12 cells (pH approximately 5.9) via two-photon fluorescence microscopy. Incubation with methamphetamine led to an increase in vesicular pH (pH approximately 6.4), consistent with a proposed mechanism of action of this psychostimulant, and eventually to redistribution of vesicular content (including Mini202) from vesicles to cytoplasm. Mini202 is sufficiently bright, photostable, and suitable for two-photon microscopy. This probe will enable fundamental neuroscience and neuroendocrine research as well as drug screening efforts.",

        "Abstract": "Continuous turnover of intracellular components by autophagy is necessary to preserve cellular homeostasis in all tissues. Alterations in macroautophagy, the main process responsible for bulk autophagic degradation, have been proposed to contribute to pathogenesis in Huntington's disease (HD), a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. However, the precise mechanism behind macroautophagy malfunction in HD is poorly understood. In this work, using cellular and mouse models of HD and cells from humans with HD, we have identified a primary defect in the ability of autophagic vacuoles to recognize cytosolic cargo in HD cells. Autophagic vacuoles form at normal or even enhanced rates in HD cells and are adequately eliminated by lysosomes, but they fail to efficiently trap cytosolic cargo in their lumen. We propose that inefficient engulfment of cytosolic components by autophagosomes is responsible for their slower turnover, functional decay and accumulation inside HD cells.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play an important role in the motivational systems underlying drug addiction, and recent work has suggested that they also release the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. To assess a physiological role for glutamate corelease, we disrupted the expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 selectively in dopamine neurons. The conditional knockout abolishes glutamate release from midbrain dopamine neurons in culture and severely reduces their excitatory synaptic output in mesoaccumbens slices. Baseline motor behavior is not affected, but stimulation of locomotor activity by cocaine is impaired, apparently through a selective reduction of dopamine stores in the projection of VTA neurons to ventral striatum. Glutamate co-entry promotes monoamine storage by increasing the pH gradient that drives vesicular monoamine transport. Remarkably, low concentrations of glutamate acidify synaptic vesicles more slowly but to a greater extent than equimolar Cl(-), indicating a distinct, presynaptic mechanism to regulate quantal size.",

        "Abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) appears to normally regulate neurotransmitter release, possibly via calcium-dependent binding and dissociation from lipid domains on secretory vesicles. The pathogenic effects of alpha-syn leading to Parkinson's disease (PD) appear to result from alternate toxic effects on lipid membrane. A variety of findings indicate that overexpression of wild-type alpha-syn, pathogenic mutations of alpha-syn, and dopamine-modified-alpha-syn promote toxic interaction between alpha-syn oligomers and lipids. These may disrupt transmembrane concentration gradients across secretory vesicles and other organelles and interfere with normal lysosomal or ubiqutin/proteasome mediated protein degradation or mitochondrial function. Additional causes of PD may interfere at other points with normal handling and degradation of alpha-syn, providing a variety of entry points to a converging neurodegenerative path underlying the disease.",

        "Title": "Neuromelanin activates microglia and induces degeneration of dopaminergic neurons: implications for progression of Parkinson's disease.",
        "Abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), there is a progressive loss of neuromelanin (NM)-containing dopamine neurons in substantia nigra (SN) which is associated with microgliosis and presence of extracellular NM. Herein, we have investigated the interplay between microglia and human NM on the degeneration of SN dopaminergic neurons. Although NM particles are phagocytized and degraded by microglia within minutes in vitro, extracellular NM particles induce microglial activation and ensuing production of superoxide, nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide (H\u2082O\u2082), and pro-inflammatory factors. Furthermore, NM produces, in a microglia-depended manner, neurodegeneration in primary ventral midbrain cultures. Neurodegeneration was effectively attenuated with microglia derived from mice deficient in macrophage antigen complex-1, a microglial integrin receptor involved in the initiation of phagocytosis. Neuronal loss was also attenuated with microglia derived from mice deficient in phagocytic oxidase, a subunit of NADPH oxidase, that is responsible for superoxide and H\u2082O\u2082 production, or apocynin, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor. In vivo, NM injected into rat SN produces microgliosis and a loss of tyrosine hydroxylase neurons. Thus, these results show that extracellular NM can activate microglia, which in turn may induce dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD. Our study may have far-reaching implications, both pathogenic and therapeutic.",

        "Title": "Glutamate controls growth rate and branching of dopaminergic axons.",
        "Abstract": "Dopamine-releasing neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta produce an extraordinarily dense and expansive plexus of innervation in the striatum converging with glutamatergic corticostriatal and thalamostriatal axon terminals at dendritic spines of medium spiny neurons. Here, we investigated whether glutamatergic signaling promotes arborization and growth of dopaminergic axons. In postnatal ventral midbrain cultures, dopaminergic axons rapidly responded to glutamate stimulation with accelerated growth and growth cone splitting when NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptors were activated. In contrast, when AMPA/kainate receptors were selectively activated, axon growth rate was decreased. To address whether this switch in axonal growth response was mediated by distinct calcium signals, we used calcium imaging. Combined NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptor activation elicited calcium signals in axonal growth cones that were mediated by calcium influx through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels and ryanodine receptor-induced calcium release from intracellular stores. AMPA/kainate receptor activation alone elicited calcium signals that were solely attributable to calcium influx through L-type calcium channels. We found that inhibitors of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases prevented the NMDA receptor-dependent axonal growth acceleration, whereas AMPA/kainate-induced axonal growth decrease was blocked by inhibitors of calcineurin and by increased cAMP levels. Our data suggest that the balance between NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptor activation regulates the axonal arborization pattern of dopamine axons through the activation of competing calcium-dependent signaling pathways. Understanding the mechanisms of dopaminergic axonal arborization is essential to the development of treatments that aim to restore dopaminergic innervation in Parkinson's disease.",

        "Abstract": "The basis for selective death of specific neuronal populations in neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a synucleinopathy characterized by a preferential loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), whereas neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are spared. Using intracellular patch electrochemistry to directly measure cytosolic dopamine (DA(cyt)) in cultured midbrain neurons, we confirm that elevated DA(cyt) and its metabolites are neurotoxic and that genetic and pharmacological interventions that decrease DA(cyt) provide neuroprotection. L-DOPA increased DA(cyt) in SN neurons to levels 2- to 3-fold higher than in VTA neurons, a response dependent on dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels, resulting in greater susceptibility of SN neurons to L-DOPA-induced neurotoxicity. DA(cyt) was not altered by alpha-synuclein deletion, although dopaminergic neurons lacking alpha-synuclein were resistant to L-DOPA-induced cell death. Thus, an interaction between Ca2+, DA(cyt), and alpha-synuclein may underlie the susceptibility of SN neurons in PD, suggesting multiple therapeutic targets.",

        "Title": "Bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice expressing a truncated mutant parkin exhibit age-dependent hypokinetic motor deficits, dopaminergic neuron degeneration, and accumulation of proteinase K-resistant alpha-synuclein.",
        "Abstract": "Recessive mutations in parkin are the most common cause of familial early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent studies suggest that certain parkin mutants may exert dominant toxic effects to cultured cells and such dominant toxicity can lead to progressive dopaminergic (DA) neuron degeneration in Drosophila. To explore whether mutant parkin could exert similar pathogenic effects to mammalian DA neurons in vivo, we developed a BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) transgenic mouse model expressing a C-terminal truncated human mutant parkin (Parkin-Q311X) in DA neurons driven by a dopamine transporter promoter. Parkin-Q311X mice exhibit multiple late-onset and progressive hypokinetic motor deficits. Stereological analyses reveal that the mutant mice develop age-dependent DA neuron degeneration in substantia nigra accompanied by a significant loss of DA neuron terminals in the striatum. Neurochemical analyses reveal a significant reduction of the striatal dopamine level in mutant mice, which is significantly correlated with their hypokinetic motor deficits. Finally, mutant Parkin-Q311X mice, but not wild-type controls, exhibit age-dependent accumulation of proteinase K-resistant endogenous alpha-synuclein in substantia nigra and colocalized with 3-nitrotyrosine, a marker for oxidative protein damage. Hence, our study provides the first mammalian genetic evidence that dominant toxicity of a parkin mutant is sufficient to elicit age-dependent hypokinetic motor deficits and DA neuron loss in vivo, and uncovers a causal relationship between dominant parkin toxicity and progressive alpha-synuclein accumulation in DA neurons. Our study underscores the need to further explore the putative link between parkin dominant toxicity and PD.",

        "Abstract": "Acute exposure to amphetamines (AMPHs) collapses secretory vesicle pH gradients, which increases cytosolic catecholamine levels while decreasing the quantal size of catecholamine release during fusion events. AMPH and methamphetamine (METH), however, are retained in tissues over long durations. We used optical and electron microscopic probes to measure the effects of long-term METH exposure on secretory vesicle pH, and amperometry and intracellular patch electrochemistry to observe the effects on neurosecretion and cytosolic catecholamines in cultured rat chromaffin cells. In contrast to acute METH effects, exposure to the drug for 6-48 h at 10 microM and higher concentrations produced a concentration-dependent rebound hyperacidification of secretory vesicles. At 5-10 microM levels, prolonged METH increased the quantal size and reinstated exocytotic catecholamine release, although very high (> 100 microM) levels of the drug, while continuing to produce rebound hyperacidification, did not increase quantal size. Secretory vesicle rebound hyperacidification was temperature dependent with optimal response at approximately 37 degrees C, was not blocked by the transcription inhibitor, puromycin, and appears to be a general compensatory response to prolonged exposure with membranophilic weak bases, including AMPHs, methylphenidate, cocaine, and ammonia. Thus, under some conditions of prolonged exposure, AMPHs and other weak bases can enhance, rather than deplete, the vesicular release of catecholamines via a compensatory response resulting in vesicle acidification.",

        "Abstract": "Addiction-associated behaviors such as drug craving and relapse are hypothesized to result from synaptic changes that persist long after withdrawal and are renormalized by drug reinstatement, although such chronic synaptic effects have not been identified. We report that exposure to the dopamine releaser methamphetamine for 10 days elicits a long-lasting (>4 month) depression at corticostriatal terminals that is reversed by methamphetamine readministration. Both methamphetamine-induced chronic presynaptic depression and the drug's selective renormalization in drug-experienced animals are independent of corresponding long-term changes in synaptic dopamine release but are due to alterations in D1 dopamine and cholinergic receptor systems. These mechanisms might provide a synaptic basis that underlies addiction and habit learning and their long-term maintenance.",

        "Abstract": "The most striking morphologic change in neurons during normal aging is the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles filled with lipofuscin or neuromelanin pigments. These organelles are similar to those containing the ceroid pigments associated with neurologic disorders, particularly in diseases caused by lysosomal dysfunction. The pigments arise from incompletely degraded proteins and lipids principally derived from the breakdown of mitochondria or products of oxidized catecholamines. Pigmented autophagic vacuoles may eventually occupy a major portion of the neuronal cell body volume because of resistance of the pigments to lysosomal degradation and/or inadequate fusion of the vacuoles with lysosomes. Although the formation of autophagic vacuoles via macroautophagy protects the neuron from cellular stress, accumulation of pigmented autophagic vacuoles may eventually interfere with normal degradative pathways and endocytic/secretory tasks such as appropriate response to growth factors.",

        "Abstract": "Methamphetamine (Meth) is abused by over 35 million people worldwide. Chronic Meth abuse may be particularly devastating in individuals who engage in unprotected sex with multiple partners because it is associated with a 2-fold higher risk for obtaining HIV and associated secondary infections. We report the first specific evidence that Meth at pharmacological concentrations exerts a direct immunosuppressive effect on dendritic cells and macrophages. As a weak base, Meth collapses the pH gradient across acidic organelles, including lysosomes and associated autophagic organelles. This in turn inhibits receptor-mediated phagocytosis of antibody-coated particles, MHC class II antigen processing by the endosomal-lysosomal pathway, and antigen presentation to splenic T cells by dendritic cells. More importantly Meth facilitates intracellular replication and inhibits intracellular killing of Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, two major AIDS-related pathogens. Meth exerts previously unreported direct immunosuppressive effects that contribute to increased risk of infection and exacerbate AIDS pathology.",

        "Abstract": "Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is the principle intermediate filament (IF) protein in astrocytes. Mutations in the GFAP gene lead to Alexander disease (AxD), a rare, fatal neurological disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal astrocytes that contain GFAP protein aggregates, termed Rosenthal fibers (RFs), and the loss of myelin. All GFAP mutations cause the same histopathological defect, i.e. RFs, though little is known how the mutations affect protein accumulation as well as astrocyte function. In this study, we found that GFAP accumulation induces macroautophagy, a key clearance mechanism for prevention of aggregated proteins. This autophagic response is negatively regulated by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The activation of p38 MAPK by GFAP accumulation is in part responsible for the down-regulation of phosphorylated-mTOR and the subsequent activation of autophagy. Our study suggests that AxD mutant GFAP accumulation stimulates autophagy, in a manner regulated by p38 MAPK and mTOR signaling pathways. Autophagy, in turn, serves as a mechanism to reduce GFAP levels.",

        "Abstract": "Protein kinase C (PKC) activity mediates multiple neurosecretory processes, but these are poorly understood due in part to the existence of at least 12 PKC isoforms. Using amperometry to record quantal catecholamine release from chromaffin cells, we found that both broad spectrum PKC antagonists and rottlerin, a selective inhibitor of the novel isoforms PKC theta and PKC delta, decreased quantal size and the number of secretory events recorded per stimulus. In contrast, drugs that selectively inhibit the atypical and conventional PKC isoforms had no effect on these parameters. While both PKC theta and delta were expressed in chromaffin cells, mice deficient for PKC theta, but not for PKC delta, exhibited lower quantal size than wild-type and were insensitive to rottlerin. Finally, an inhibitory PKC theta pseudosubstrate produced rottlerin-like responses in wild-type mice, indicating that the lack of rottlerin response in the PKC theta mutants was not the result of a form of compensation. These findings demonstrate neurosecretory regulation by a novel PKC isoform, PKC theta, and should contribute to defining mechanisms of activity-dependent regulation of neurosecretion.",

        "Abstract": "Research in autophagy continues to accelerate,(1) and as a result many new scientists are entering the field. Accordingly, it is important to establish a standard set of criteria for monitoring macroautophagy in different organisms. Recent reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose.(2,3) There are many useful and convenient methods that can be used to monitor macroautophagy in yeast, but relatively few in other model systems, and there is much confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure macroautophagy in higher eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers of autophagosomes versus those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway; thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from fully functional autophagy that includes delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of the methods that can be used by investigators who are attempting to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as by reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that investigate these processes. This set of guidelines is not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to verify an autophagic response.",

        "Abstract": "Altered degradation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD). We have shown that alpha-syn can be degraded via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective lysosomal mechanism for degradation of cytosolic proteins. Pathogenic mutants of alpha-syn block lysosomal translocation, impairing their own degradation along with that of other CMA substrates. While pathogenic alpha-syn mutations are rare, alpha-syn undergoes posttranslational modifications, which may underlie its accumulation in cytosolic aggregates in most forms of PD. Using mouse ventral medial neuron cultures, SH-SY5Y cells in culture, and isolated mouse lysosomes, we have found that most of these posttranslational modifications of alpha-syn impair degradation of this protein by CMA but do not affect degradation of other substrates. Dopamine-modified alpha-syn, however, is not only poorly degraded by CMA but also blocks degradation of other substrates by this pathway. As blockage of CMA increases cellular vulnerability to stressors, we propose that dopamine-induced autophagic inhibition could explain the selective degeneration of PD dopaminergic neurons.",

This shift protects SN neurons in chemical models of Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting that elevated intracellular Ca2+ participates in SN cell loss and that dihydropyridines may provide therapy in PD.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease arises from genetic and possibly neurotoxic causes that produce massive cell death of the neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Loss of these neurons is essential for the diagnostic parkinsonian features. Although many genetic mutations have been suggested as causes or risk factors for Parkinson's disease, the low penetrance of some mutations and the low disease concordance in relatives suggests that there must be interactions between multiple factors. We suggest that 'multiple hits' that combine toxic stress, for example, from dopamine oxidation or mitochondrial dysfunction, with an inhibition of a neuroprotective response, such as loss of function of parkin or stress-induced autophagic degradation, underlie selective neuronal death. We discuss the properties of substantia nigra dopamine neurons that might make them particular targets of such multiple hits.",

        "Title": "Alpha-synuclein overexpression in PC12 and chromaffin cells impairs catecholamine release by interfering with a late step in exocytosis.",
        "Abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), a protein implicated in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, is a presynaptic protein suggested to regulate transmitter release. We explored how alpha-syn overexpression in PC12 and chromaffin cells, which exhibit low endogenous alpha-syn levels relative to neurons, affects catecholamine release. Overexpression of wild-type or A30P mutant alpha-syn in PC12 cell lines inhibited evoked catecholamine release without altering calcium threshold or cooperativity of release. Electron micrographs revealed that vesicular pools were not reduced but that, on the contrary, a marked accumulation of morphologically \"docked\" vesicles was apparent in the alpha-syn-overexpressing lines. We used amperometric recordings from chromaffin cells derived from mice that overexpress A30P or wild-type (WT) alpha-syn, as well as chromaffin cells from control and alpha-syn null mice, to determine whether the filling of vesicles with the transmitter was altered. The quantal size and shape characteristics of amperometric events were identical for all mouse lines, suggesting that overexpression of WT or mutant alpha-syn did not affect vesicular transmitter accumulation or the kinetics of vesicle fusion. The frequency and number of exocytotic events per stimulus, however, was lower for both WT and A30P alpha-syn-overexpressing cells. The alpha-syn-overexpressing cells exhibited reduced depression of evoked release in response to repeated stimuli, consistent with a smaller population of readily releasable vesicles. We conclude that alpha-syn overexpression inhibits a vesicle \"priming\" step, after secretory vesicle trafficking to \"docking\" sites but before calcium-dependent vesicle membrane fusion.",

        "Abstract": "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has shown robust neuroprotective and neuroreparative activities in various animal models of Parkinson's Disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The successful use of GDNF as a therapeutic in humans, however, appears to have been hindered by its poor bioavailability to target neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). To improve delivery of exogenous GDNF protein to CNS motor neurons, we employed chemical conjugation techniques to link recombinant human GDNF to the neuronal binding fragment of tetanus toxin (tetanus toxin fragment C, or TTC). The predominant species present in the purified conjugate sample, GDNF:TTC, had a molecular weight of approximately 80 kDa as determined by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Like GDNF, addition of GDNF:TTC to culture media of neuroblastoma cells expressing GFRalpha-1/c-RET produced a dose-dependent increase in cellular phospho-c-RET levels. Treatment of cultured midbrain dopaminergic neurons with either GDNF or the conjugate similarly promoted both DA neuron survival and neurite outgrowth. However, in contrast to mice treated with GDNF by intramuscular injection, mice receiving GDNF:TTC revealed intense GDNF immunostaining associated with spinal cord motor neurons in fixed tissue sections. That GDNF:TTC provided neuroprotection of axotomized motor neurons in neonatal rats further revealed that the conjugate retained its GDNF activity in vivo. These results indicate that TTC can serve as a non-viral vehicle to substantially improve the delivery of functionally active growth factors to motor neurons in the mammalian CNS.",

        "Title": "Alpha-synuclein overexpression increases cytosolic catecholamine concentration.",
        "Abstract": "Dysregulation of dopamine homeostasis and elevation of the cytosolic level of the transmitter have been suggested to underlie the vulnerability of catecholaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. Because several known mutations in alpha-synuclein or overexpression of the wild-type (WT) protein causes familial forms of Parkinson's disease, we investigated possible links between alpha-synuclein pathogenesis and dopamine homeostasis. Chromaffin cells isolated from transgenic mice that overexpress A30P alpha-synuclein displayed significantly increased cytosolic catecholamine levels as measured by intracellular patch electrochemistry, whereas cells overexpressing the WT protein and those from knock-out animals were not different from controls. Likewise, catechol concentrations were higher in L-DOPA-treated PC12 cells overexpressing A30P or A53T compared with those expressing WT alpha-synuclein, although the ability of cells to maintain a low cytosolic dopamine level after L-DOPA challenge was markedly inhibited by either protein. We also found that incubation with low-micromolar concentrations of WT, A30P, or A53T alpha-synuclein inhibited ATP-dependent maintenance of pH gradients in isolated chromaffin vesicles and that the WT protein was significantly less potent in inducing the proton leakage. In summary, we demonstrate that overexpression of different types of alpha-synuclein disrupts vesicular pH and leads to a marked increase in the levels of cytosolic catechol species, an effect that may in turn trigger cellular oxyradical damage. Although multiple molecular mechanisms may be responsible for the perturbation of cytosolic catecholamine homeostasis, this study provides critical evidence about how alpha-synuclein might exert its cytotoxicity and selectively damage catecholaminergic cells.",

        "Abstract": "The release of monoamine neurotransmitters from cell bodies and dendrites has an important role in behavior, but the mechanism (vesicular or non vesicular) has remained unclear. Because the location of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) defines the secretory vesicles capable of monoamine release, we have studied its trafficking to assess the potential for monoamine release by exocytosis. In neuroendocrine PC12 cells, VMAT2 localizes exclusively to large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs), and we now show that cytoplasmic signals target VMAT2 directly to LDCVs within the biosynthetic pathway. In neurons, VMAT2 localizes to a population of vesicles that we now find undergo regulated exocytosis in dendrites. Although hippocampal neurons do not express typical LDCV proteins, transfected chromogranins A, B, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) colocalize with VMAT2. VMAT2 thus defines a population of secretory vesicles that mediate the activity-dependent somatodendritic release of multiple retrograde signals involved in synaptic function, growth, and plasticity.",

        "Abstract": "Microdeletions of 22q11.2 represent one of the highest known genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. It is likely that more than one gene contributes to the marked risk associated with this locus. Two of the candidate risk genes encode the enzymes proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which modulate the levels of a putative neuromodulator (L-proline) and the neurotransmitter dopamine, respectively. Mice that model the state of PRODH deficiency observed in humans with schizophrenia show increased neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic synapses as well as deficits in associative learning and response to psychomimetic drugs. Transcriptional profiling and pharmacological manipulations identified a transcriptional and behavioral interaction between the Prodh and Comt genes that is likely to represent a homeostatic response to enhanced dopaminergic signaling in the frontal cortex. This interaction modulates a number of schizophrenia-related phenotypes, providing a framework for understanding the high disease risk associated with this locus, the expression of the phenotype, or both.",

        "Abstract": "Septin 5, a parkin substrate, is a vesicle- and membrane-associated protein that plays a significant role in inhibiting exocytosis. The regulatory function of Septin 5 in dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons of substantia nigra (SN), maintained at relatively low levels, has not yet been delineated. As loss of function mutations of parkin are the principal cause of a familial Parkinson's disease, a prevailing hypothesis is that the loss of parkin activity results in accumulation of Septin 5 which confers neuron-specific toxicity in SN-DAergic neurons. In vitro and in vivo models were used to support this hypothesis. In our well-characterized DAergic SN4741 cell model, acute accumulation of elevated levels of Septin 5, but not synphilin-1 (another parkin substrate), resulted in cytotoxic cell death that was markedly reduced by parkin co-transfection. A transgenic mouse model expressing a dominant negative parkin mutant accumulated moderate levels of Septin 5 in SN-DAergic neurons. These mice acquired a progressive l-DOPA responsive motor dysfunction that developed despite a 25% higher than normal level of striatal dopamine (DA) and no apparent loss of DAergic neurons. The phenotype of this animal, increased striatal dopamine and reduced motor function, was similar to that observed in parkin knockout animals, suggesting a common DAergic alteration. These data suggest that a threshold level of Septin 5 accumulation is required for DAergic cell loss and that l-DOPA-responsive motor deficits can occur even in the presence of elevated DA.",

Approximately 65% of events resulted in full fusion, and the remaining 35% in hemifusion; of those, approximately two thirds were permanent and approximately one third were reversible. We predict that this relatively close balance among outcomes could be tipped by binding of regulatory proteins to the SNAREs, allowing for dynamic physiological regulation between full fusion and reversible kiss-and-run-like events.",

        "Abstract": "Amphetamine and substituted amphetamines, including methamphetamine, methylphenidate (Ritalin), methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), and the herbs khat and ephedra, encompass the only widely administered class of drugs that predominantly release neurotransmitter, in this case principally catecholamines, by a non-exocytic mechanism. These drugs play important medicinal and social roles in many cultures, exert profound effects on mental function and behavior, and can produce neurodegeneration and addiction. Numerous questions remain regarding the unusual molecular mechanisms by which these compounds induce catecholamine release. We review current issues on the two apparent primary mechanisms--the redistribution of catecholamines from synaptic vesicles to the cytosol, and induction of reverse transport of transmitter through plasma membrane uptake carriers--and on additional drug effects that affect extracellular catecholamine levels, including uptake inhibition, effects on exocytosis, neurotransmitter synthesis, and metabolism.",

While there are uncommon instances of familial PD, and rare instances of known genetic causes, the etiology of the vast majority of PD cases remains unknown (i.e., idiopathic). Here we outline genetic and environmental findings related to PD epidemiology, suggestions that aberrant protein degradation may play a role in disease pathogenesis, and pathogenetic mechanisms including oxidative stress due to DA oxidation that could underlie the selectivity of neurodegeneration. We then outline potential approaches to neuroprotection for PD that are derived from current notions on disease pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Neuromelanin (NM) accumulates as a function of age in normal human substantia nigra (SN) but is relatively depleted in the SN of patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Several studies have been performed to further our understanding of the role of NM in neuronal aging and neurodegenerative mechanisms of PD. To this purpose, NM from human SN was isolated and its structure and molecular interactions were investigated. Cysteinyl-dopamine was shown to be one precursor of NM synthesis. A striking affinity of NM for specific metals, lipids, drugs and pesticides was found in vitro, and in animal and human brain postmortem studies. Because of these affinities, NM seems to play a protective role in the human brain by blocking toxic molecules. On the other hand, experiments in cell culture indicate that NM can activate microglia, eliciting the release of cytotoxic factors that can induce neurodegeneration.",

Little is known, however, about the pathways by which wild-type alpha-synuclein is normally degraded. We found that wild-type alpha-synuclein was selectively translocated into lysosomes for degradation by the chaperone-mediated autophagy pathway. The pathogenic A53T and A30P alpha-synuclein mutants bound to the receptor for this pathway on the lysosomal membrane, but appeared to act as uptake blockers, inhibiting both their own degradation and that of other substrates. These findings may underlie the toxic gain-of-function by the mutants.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine input to the striatum is required for voluntary motor movement, behavioral reinforcement, and responses to drugs of abuse. It is speculated that these functions are dependent on either excitatory or inhibitory modulation of corticostriatal synapses onto medium spiny neurons (MSNs). While dopamine modulates MSN excitability, a direct presynaptic effect on the corticostriatal input has not been clearly demonstrated. We combined optical monitoring of synaptic vesicle exocytosis from motor area corticostriatal afferents and electrochemical recordings of striatal dopamine release to directly measure effects of dopamine at the level of individual presynaptic terminals. Dopamine released by either electrical stimulation or amphetamine acted via D2 receptors to inhibit the activity of subsets of corticostriatal terminals. Optical and electrophysiological data suggest that heterosynaptic inhibition was enhanced by higher frequency stimulation and was selective for the least active terminals. Thus, dopamine, by filtering less active inputs, appears to reinforce specific sets of corticostriatal synaptic connections.",

Here we show that nicotine's effects depend on the firing pattern of dopamine neurons, so that while desensitization of nAChRs indeed curbs dopamine released by stimuli emulating tonic firing, it allows a rapid rise in dopamine from stimuli emulating phasic firing patterns associated with incentive/salience paradigms. Nicotine may thus enhance the contrast of dopamine signals associated with behavioral cues.",

        "Abstract": "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been shown to protect and restore dopamine (DA) neurons in injury models and is being evaluated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, little is known of its physiological role. We have shown that GDNF suppresses apoptosis in DA neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) postnatally both in vitro and during their first phase of natural cell death in vivo. Furthermore, intrastriatal injection of neutralizing antibodies augments cell death, suggesting that endogenous GDNF plays a role as a target-derived factor. Such a role would predict that overexpression of GDNF in striatum would increase the surviving number of SN DA neurons. To test this hypothesis, we used the tetracycline-dependent transcription activator (tTA)/tTA-responsive promoter system to create mice that overexpress GDNF selectively in the striatum, cortex, and hippocampus. These mice demonstrate an increased number of SN DA neurons after the first phase of natural cell death. However, this increase does not persist into adulthood. As adults, these mice also do not have increased dopaminergic innervation of the striatum. They do, however, demonstrate increased numbers of ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons and increased innervation of the cortex. This morphologic phenotype is associated with an increased locomotor response to amphetamine. We conclude that striatal GDNF is necessary and sufficient to regulate the number of SN DA neurons surviving the first phase of natural cell death, but it is not sufficient to increase their final adult number. GDNF in VTA targets, however, is sufficient to regulate the adult number of DA neurons.",

        "Abstract": "A key question in understanding mechanisms of neurotransmitter release is whether the fusion pore of a synaptic vesicle regulates the amount of transmitter released during exocytosis. We measured dopamine release from small synaptic vesicles of rat cultured ventral midbrain neurons using carbon fiber amperometry. Our data indicate that small synaptic vesicle fusion pores flicker either once or multiple times in rapid succession, with each flicker releasing approximately 25-30% of vesicular dopamine. The incidence of events with multiple flickers was reciprocally regulated by phorbol esters and staurosporine. Thus, dopamine neurons regulate the amount of neurotransmitter released by small synaptic vesicles by controlling the number of fusion pore flickers per exocytotic event. This mode of exocytosis is a potential mechanism whereby neurons can rapidly reuse vesicles without undergoing the comparatively slow process of recycling.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine neurons are thought to convey a fast, incentive salience signal, faster than can be mediated by dopamine. A resolution of this paradox may be that midbrain dopamine neurons exert fast excitatory actions. Using transgenic mice with fluorescent dopamine neurons, in which the axonal projections of the neurons are visible, we made horizontal brain slices encompassing the mesoaccumbens dopamine projection. Focal extracellular stimulation of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area evoked dopamine release and early monosynaptic and late polysynaptic excitatory responses in postsynaptic nucleus accumbens neurons. Local superfusion of the ventral tegmental area with glutamate, which should activate dopamine neurons selectively, produced an increase in excitatory synaptic events. Local superfusion of the ventral tegmental area with the D2 agonist quinpirole, which should increase the threshold for dopamine neuron activation, inhibited the early response. So dopamine neurons make glutamatergic synaptic connections to accumbens neurons. We propose that dopamine neuron glutamatergic transmission may be the initial component of the incentive salience signal.",

        "Abstract": "Cortical glutamate and substantia nigra dopamine (DA) afferents converge onto the dendritic spines of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum where they act to modulate motor and cognitive functions. The released DA spills over from its synapse and is thought to regulate glutamatergic input by acting on distal DA receptors located on corticostriatal axon terminals. By monitoring evoked DA release directly using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, we report a reciprocal modulation by glutamate spillover on evoked striatal DA release, induced by either glutamate uptake blockade or high-frequency stimulation of corticostriatal tracts. We demonstrate that this modulation is attributable to the activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. Thus, under conditions in which glutamate escapes the confines of its synapse, it can elicit the presynaptic suppression of dopaminergic neurotransmission.",

        "Abstract": "The fundamental process that underlies volume transmission in the brain is the extracellular diffusion of neurotransmitters from release sites to distal target cells. Dopaminergic neurons display a range of activity states, from low-frequency tonic firing to bursts of high-frequency action potentials (phasic firing). However, it is not clear how this activity affects volume transmission on a subsecond time scale. To evaluate this, we developed a finite-difference model that predicts the lifetime and diffusion of dopamine in brain tissue. We first used this model to decode in vivo amperometric measurements of electrically evoked dopamine, and obtained rate constants for release and uptake as well as the extent of diffusion. Accurate predictions were made under a variety of conditions including different regions, different stimulation parameters and with uptake inhibited. Second, we used the decoded rate constants to predict how heterogeneity of dopamine release and uptake sites would affect dopamine concentration fluctuations during different activity states in the absence of an electrode. These simulations show that synchronous phasic firing can produce spatially and temporally heterogeneous concentration profiles whereas asynchronous tonic firing elicits uniform, steady-state dopamine concentrations.",

Recordings in vivo or in slice preparations monitor diffusion of catecholamine following stimulated synaptic release into the surrounding tissue. This synaptic 'overflow' is defined by the amount of release, by the activity of reuptake, and by the diffusion parameters in brain tissue. Such studies have elucidated the complex regulation of catecholamine release and uptake, and how psychostimulants and anti-psychotic drugs interfere with it. Moreover, recordings with carbon-fiber electrodes from cultured neurons have provided analysis of catecholamine release and its plasticity at the quantal level.",

        "Abstract": "Alterations in the cytosolic pool directly affect neurotransmitter synthesis and release and are suggested to be key factors in various neurodegenerative disorders. Although this cytosolic pool is the most metabolically active, it is miniscule compared with the amount of vesicular transmitter and has never been quantified separately. Here, we introduce intracellular patch electrochemistry (IPE), a technique that for the first time provides direct measurements of cytosolic oxidizable molecules in single mammalian cells. In amperometric mode, IPE detects total catechols, whereas in cyclic voltammetric mode, it preferentially measures catecholamines. In cultured chromaffin cells, the total cytosolic catechol concentration was 50-500 microm, of which approximately 10% were catecholamines. Reserpine, a vesicular monoamine transporter inhibitor, had no effect on the catecholamine pool but increased total catechols by fourfold to fivefold. Combined with pargyline, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, reserpine increased catecholamine levels in the cytosol by approximately sixfold. Amphetamine induced a transient approximately fivefold accumulation of cytosolic catecholamines and a slow increase of total catechols. In cells incubated with 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-DOPA), catecholamines increased by approximately 2.5-fold and total catechols increased by approximately fourfold. Cytosolic catecholamines returned to control levels <or=10 min after L-DOPA withdrawal, whereas total catechols remained approximately twofold elevated even after a 1.5 hr incubation in L-DOPA-free media. Our data indicate that cytosolic catecholamines are strictly maintained at a defined level, and drug-induced increases in their concentrations lead to the accumulation of other catecholamine derivatives, such as DOPAC and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol. These derivatives reside in the cytosol for hours after treatment and may be an underlying cause of drug-related cytotoxicity.",

        "Abstract": "Substantia nigra (SN) dopamine neurons express D2 and D3 dopamine autoreceptors. A physiological role for the D3 receptor has not been identified, but an activation of G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK; also known as Kir3) channels is strongly implicated because D3 receptors activate channels composed of GIRK2 subunits in cell lines. We confirmed that acutely dissociated SN dopamine neurons indeed contain D3 and GIRK2 subunit mRNA using single-cell RT-PCR. We then tested whether D3 receptors activate GIRK currents in SN dopamine neurons by comparing acutely dissociated neurons from D2-/- receptor knock-out and congenic wild-type mice. In nearly all (14 of 15) wild-type SN dopamine neurons, the D2/D3 agonist quinpirole activated GIRK currents that were blocked by cesium. Quinpirole, however, elicited no GIRK currents in any SN dopamine neuron (0 of 13) derived from D2-/- receptor knock-out mice. The absence of quinpirole response was not caused by a lack of GIRK activity, because the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen continued to elicit these currents in the mutant neurons. Thus, it appears that D3 activation of GIRK currents in SN neurons does not occur or is exceedingly rare.",

        "Abstract": "Midbrain dopaminergic neurons maintain low ongoing \"tonic\" activity interrupted by high frequency bursts associated with behavioral reward. Dopamine released during bursts feeds back onto D(2) autoreceptors that depress neuronal activity.

This response extends the range of states regulated by neurotransmitter feedback, and could contribute importantly to understanding amphetamine action.",

        "Abstract": "Quantal release of the principal excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate requires a mechanism for its transport into secretory vesicles. Within the brain, the complementary expression of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) 1 and 2 accounts for the release of glutamate by all known excitatory neurons. We now report the identification of VGLUT3 and its expression by many cells generally considered to release a classical transmitter with properties very different from glutamate. Remarkably, subpopulations of inhibitory neurons as well as cholinergic interneurons, monoamine neurons, and glia express VGLUT3. The dendritic expression of VGLUT3 by particular neurons also indicates the potential for retrograde synaptic signaling. The distribution and subcellular location of VGLUT3 thus suggest novel modes of signaling by glutamate.",

        "Abstract": "Methamphetamine (METH) selectively injures the neurites of dopamine (DA) neurons, generally without inducing cell death. It has been proposed that METH-induced redistribution of DA from the vesicular storage pool to the cytoplasm, where DA can oxidize to produce quinones and additional reactive oxygen species, may account for this selective neurotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, we used mice heterozygous (+/-) or homozygous (-/-) for the brain vesicular monoamine uptake transporter VMAT2, which mediates the accumulation of cytosolic DA into synaptic vesicles. In postnatal ventral midbrain neuronal cultures derived from these mice, METH-induced degeneration of DA neurites and accumulation of oxyradicals, including metabolites of oxidized DA, varied inversely with VMAT2 expression. METH administration also promoted the synthesis of DA via upregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity, resulting in an elevation of cytosolic DA even in the absence of vesicular sequestration. Electron microscopy and fluorescent labeling confirmed that METH promoted the formation of autophagic granules, particularly in neuronal varicosities and, ultimately, within cell bodies of dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, we propose that METH neurotoxicity results from the induction of a specific cellular pathway that is activated when DA cannot be effectively sequestered in synaptic vesicles, thereby producing oxyradical stress, autophagy, and neurite degeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is most commonly a sporadic illness, and is characterized by degeneration of substantia nigra dopamine (DA) neurons and abnormal cytoplasmic aggregates of alpha-synuclein. Rarely, PD may be caused by missense mutations in alpha-synuclein. MPTP, a neurotoxin that inhibits mitochondrial complex I, is a prototype for an environmental cause of PD because it produces a pattern of DA neurodegeneration that closely resembles the neuropathology of PD. Here we show that alpha-synuclein null mice display striking resistance to MPTP-induced degeneration of DA neurons and DA release, and this resistance appears to result from an inability of the toxin to inhibit complex I. Contrary to predictions from in vitro data, this resistance is not due to abnormalities of the DA transporter, which appears to function normally in alpha-synuclein null mice. Our results suggest that some genetic and environmental factors that increase susceptibility to PD may interact with a common molecular pathway, and represent the first demonstration that normal alpha-synuclein function may be important to DA neuron viability.",

        "Abstract": "Dysregulation of dopamine transmission is thought to contribute to schizophrenic psychosis and drug dependence. Dopamine release is regulated by D2 dopamine autoreceptors, and D2 receptor ligands are used to treat psychosis and addiction. To elucidate the long-term effects of D2 autoreceptor activity on dopamine signaling, dopamine overflow evoked by single or paired-pulse stimulation was compared in striatal slices from D2-null mutant and wild-type mice. Quinpirole, a D2/D3 receptor agonist, had no effect on evoked dopamine release in D2 mutant mice, indicating that D2 receptors are the only release-regulating receptors at the axon terminal. Dopamine release inhibition by GABA(B) receptor activation was unchanged in D2 mutant mice, suggesting that other G-protein-coupled pathways remained normal in the absence of D2 autoreceptors. Paired-pulse stimulation revealed that autoinhibition of dopamine release was maximal 500 msec after stimulation and lasted <5 sec. In D2-null mutants, dopamine overflow in response to single stimuli was severely decreased. Experiments with the uptake inhibitor nomifensine indicated that this was caused by enhanced dopamine uptake rather than reduced release. Analysis of dopamine overflow kinetics using a simulation model suggested that the enhanced uptake was caused by an increase in the maximal velocity of uptake, V(max). These results from D2-null mutant mice support the suggestion that D2 autoreceptors and dopamine transporters interact to regulate the amplitude and timing of dopamine signals.",

        "Title": "Stimulation-dependent regulation of the pH, volume and quantal size of bovine and rodent secretory vesicles.",
        "Abstract": "Trapping of weak bases was utilized to evaluate stimulus-induced changes in the internal pH of the secretory vesicles of chromaffin cells and enteric neurons. The internal acidity of chromaffin vesicles was increased by the nicotinic agonist 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenyl-piperazinium iodide (DMPP; in vivo and in vitro) and by high K+ (in vitro); and in enteric nerve terminals by exposure to veratridine or a plasmalemmal [Ca2+]o receptor agonist (Gd3+). Stimulation-induced acidification of chromaffin vesicles was [Ca2+]o-dependent and blocked by agents that inhibit the vacuolar proton pump (vH+-ATPase) or flux through Cl- channels. Stimulation also increased the average volume of chromaffin vesicles and the proportion that displayed a clear halo around their dense cores (called active vesicles). Stimulation-induced increases in internal acidity and size were greatest in active vesicles. Stimulation of chromaffin cells in the presence of a plasma membrane marker revealed that membrane was internalized in endosomes but not in chromaffin vesicles. The stable expression of botulinum toxin E to prevent exocytosis did not affect the stimulation-induced acidification of the secretory vesicles of mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2A cells. Stimulation-induced acidification thus occurs independently of exocytosis. The quantal size of secreted catecholamines, measured by amperometry in cultured chromaffin cells, was found to be increased either by prior exposure to L-DOPA or stimulation by high K+, and decreased by inhibition of vH+-ATPase or flux through Cl- channels. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the content of releasable small molecules in secretory vesicles is increased when the driving force for their uptake is enhanced, either by increasing the transmembrane concentration or pH gradients.",

        "Abstract": "The concentration of neuromelanin (NM) in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPC) has been measured in male and female normal subjects at different ages in the range 1-97 years old and in SNPC of parkinsonian patients. A very similar age trend of NM concentration was found in both sexes. In the first year of life NM was not detectable, between 10 and 20 years the NM levels were 0.3-0.8 microg/mg of SNPC, between 20 and 50 years were 0.8-2.3 microg/mg SNPC and between 50 and 90 were 2.3-3.7 microg/mg of SNPC. In parkinsonian subjects, the NM levels were 1.2-1.5 microg/mg of SNPC, which is less than 50% with respect to the age-matched controls. These data demonstrate a continuous NM accumulation in SNPC neurons during aging, the presence of large amounts of NM in SNPC and severe depletion of NM in Parkinson's disease.",
