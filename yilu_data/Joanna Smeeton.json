Here we show that polyamine levels decrease during differentiation and that inhibiting polyamine synthesis leads to a differentiated-like cell state.

        "Abstract": "After traumatic injury, healing of mammalian ligaments is typically associated with fibrotic scarring as opposed to scar-free regeneration. In contrast, here we show that the ligament supporting the jaw joint of adult zebrafish is capable of rapid and complete scar-free healing. Following surgical transection of the jaw joint ligament, we observe breakdown of ligament tissue adjacent to the cut sites, expansion of mesenchymal tissue within the wound site, and then remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) to a normal ligament morphology. Lineage tracing of mature ligamentocytes following transection shows that they dedifferentiate, undergo cell cycle re-entry, and contribute to the regenerated ligament. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the regenerating ligament reveals dynamic expression of ECM genes in neural-crest-derived mesenchymal cells, as well as diverse immune cells expressing the endopeptidase-encoding gene legumain. Analysis of legumain mutant zebrafish shows a requirement for early ECM remodeling and efficient ligament regeneration. Our study establishes a new model of adult scar-free ligament regeneration and highlights roles of immune-mesenchyme cross-talk in ECM remodeling that initiates regeneration.",

How neural crest cells acquire such extraordinary lineage potential remains unresolved. By integrating single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiles of cranial neural crest-derived cells across the zebrafish lifetime, we observe progressive and region-specific establishment of enhancer accessibility for distinct fates. Neural crest-derived cells rapidly diversify into specialized progenitors, including multipotent skeletal progenitors, stromal cells with a regenerative signature, fibroblasts with a unique metabolic signature linked to skeletal integrity, and gill-specific progenitors generating cell types for respiration. By retrogradely mapping the emergence of lineage-specific chromatin accessibility, we identify a wealth of candidate lineage-priming factors, including a Gata3 regulatory circuit for respiratory cell fates. Rather than multilineage potential being established during cranial neural crest specification, our findings support progressive and region-specific chromatin remodeling underlying acquisition of diverse potential.",

        "Abstract": "Vertebrate sensory organs arise from epithelial thickenings called placodes. Along with neural crest cells, cranial placodes are considered ectodermal novelties that drove evolution of the vertebrate head. The anterior-most placode generates the endocrine lobe [adenohypophysis (ADH)] of the pituitary, a master gland controlling growth, metabolism, and reproduction. In addition to known ectodermal contributions, we use lineage tracing and time-lapse imaging in zebrafish to identify an endodermal contribution to the ADH. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the adult pituitary reveals similar competency of endodermal and ectodermal epithelia to generate all endocrine cell types. Further, endoderm can generate a rudimentary ADH-like structure in the near absence of ectodermal contributions. The fish condition supports the vertebrate pituitary arising through interactions of an ancestral endoderm-derived proto-pituitary with newly evolved placodal ectoderm.",

        "Abstract": "Congenital inner ear malformations affecting both the osseous and membranous labyrinth can have a devastating impact on hearing and language development. With the exception of an enlarged vestibular aqueduct, non-syndromic inner ear malformations are rare, and their underlying molecular biology has thus far remained understudied. To identify molecular factors that might be important in the developing inner ear, we adopted a family-based trio exome sequencing approach in young unrelated subjects with severe inner ear malformations. We identified two previously unreported de novo loss-of-function variants in GREB1L [c.4368G>T;p.(Glu1410fs) and c.982C>T;p.(Arg328*)] in two affected subjects with absent cochleae and eighth cranial nerve malformations. The cochlear aplasia in these affected subjects suggests that a developmental arrest or problem at a very early stage of inner ear development exists, e.g., during the otic pit formation. Craniofacial Greb1l RNA expression peaks in mice during this time frame (E8.5). It also peaks in the developing inner ear during E13-E16, after which it decreases in adulthood. The crucial function of Greb1l in craniofacial development is also evidenced in knockout mice, which develop severe craniofacial abnormalities. In addition, we show that Greb1l",

        "Title": "Building and maintaining joints by exquisite local control of cell fate.",
        "Abstract": "We owe the flexibility of our bodies to sophisticated articulations between bones. Establishment of these joints requires the integration of multiple tissue types: permanent cartilage that cushions the articulating bones, synovial membranes that enclose a lubricating fluid-filled cavity, and a fibrous capsule and ligaments that provide structural support. Positioning the prospective joint region involves establishment of an \"interzone\" region of joint progenitor cells within a nascent cartilage condensation, which is achieved through the interplay of activators and inhibitors of multiple developmental signaling pathways. Within the interzone, tight regulation of BMP and TGF\u03b2 signaling prevents the hypertrophic maturation of joint chondrocytes, in part through downstream transcriptional repressors and epigenetic modulators. Synovial cells then acquire further specializations through expression of genes that promote lubrication, as well as the formation of complex structures such as cavities and entheses. Whereas genetic investigations in mice and humans have uncovered a number of regulators of joint development and homeostasis, recent work in zebrafish offers a complementary reductionist approach toward understanding joint positioning and the regulation of chondrocyte fate at joints. The complexity of building and maintaining joints may help explain why there are still few treatments for osteoarthritis, one of the most common diseases in the human population. A major challenge will be to understand how developmental abnormalities in joint structure, as well as postnatal roles for developmental genes in joint homeostasis, contribute to birth defects and degenerative diseases of joints.

        "Abstract": "Synovial joints are the lubricated connections between the bones of our body that are commonly affected in arthritis. It is assumed that synovial joints first evolved as vertebrates came to land, with ray-finned fishes lacking lubricated joints. Here, we examine the expression and function of a critical lubricating protein of mammalian synovial joints, Prg4/Lubricin, in diverse ray-finned fishes. We find that Prg4 homologs are specifically enriched at the jaw and pectoral fin joints of zebrafish, stickleback, and gar, with genetic deletion of the zebrafish prg4b gene resulting in the same age-related degeneration of joints as seen in lubricin-deficient mice and humans. Our data support lubricated synovial joints evolving much earlier than currently accepted, at least in the common ancestor of all bony vertebrates. Establishment of the first arthritis model in the highly regenerative zebrafish will offer unique opportunities to understand the aetiology and possible treatment of synovial joint disease.",

        "Abstract": "Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is an intracellular scaffold protein with critical cell-specific functions in the embryonic and mature mammalian kidney. Previously, we demonstrated a requirement for Ilk during ureteric branching and cell cycle regulation in collecting duct cells in vivo Although in vitro data indicate that ILK controls p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) activity, the contribution of ILK-p38MAPK signaling to branching morphogenesis in vivo is not defined. Here, we identified genes that are regulated by Ilk in ureteric cells using a whole-genome expression analysis of whole-kidney mRNA in mice with Ilk deficiency in the ureteric cell lineage. Six genes with expression in ureteric tip cells, including Wnt11, were downregulated, whereas the expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 8 (DUSP8) was upregulated. Phosphorylation of p38MAPK was decreased in kidney tissue with Ilk deficiency, but no significant decrease in the phosphorylation of other intracellular effectors previously shown to control renal morphogenesis was observed. Pharmacologic inhibition of p38MAPK activity in murine inner medullary collecting duct 3 (mIMCD3) cells decreased expression of Wnt11, Krt23, and Slo4c1 DUSP8 overexpression in mIMCD3 cells significantly inhibited p38MAPK activation and the expression of Wnt11 and Slo4c1. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of DUSP8 in cultured embryonic murine kidneys decreased ureteric branching and p38MAPK activation. Together, these data demonstrate that Ilk controls branching morphogenesis by regulating the expression of DUSP8, which inhibits p38MAPK activity and decreases branching morphogenesis.",

        "Title": "Integrin-linked kinase regulates p38 MAPK-dependent cell cycle arrest in ureteric bud development.",
        "Abstract": "The integrin-linked kinase (ILK), pinch and parvin ternary complex connects the cytoplasmic tails of beta1 integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. We recently showed that constitutive expression of ILK and alpha parvin in both the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme of the kidney is required for kidney development. In this study, we define the selective role of ILK in the ureteric bud of the mouse kidney in renal development by deleting it in the ureteric cell lineage before the onset of branching morphogenesis (E10.5). Although deleting ILK resulted in only a moderate decrease in branching, the mice died at 8 weeks of age from obstruction due to the unprecedented finding of intraluminal collecting duct cellular proliferation. ILK deletion in the ureteric bud resulted in the inability of collecting duct cells to undergo contact inhibition and to activate p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in vivo and in vitro. p38 MAPK activation was not dependent on the kinase activity of ILK. Thus, we conclude that ILK plays a crucial role in activating p38 MAPK, which regulates cell cycle arrest of epithelial cells in renal tubulogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Renal hypoplasia, defined as abnormally small kidneys with normal morphology and reduced nephron number, is a common cause of pediatric renal failure and adult-onset disease. Genetic studies performed in humans and mutant mice have implicated a number of critical genes, in utero environmental factors and molecular mechanisms that regulate nephron endowment and kidney size. Here, we review current knowledge regarding the genetic contributions to renal hypoplasia with particular emphasis on the mechanisms that control nephron endowment in humans and mice.",
