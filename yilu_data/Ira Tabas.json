        "Title": "Crosstalk between efferocytic myeloid cells and T-cells and its relevance to atherosclerosis.",
        "Abstract": "The interplay between myeloid cells and T-lymphocytes is critical to the regulation of host defense and inflammation resolution. Dysregulation of this interaction can contribute to the development of chronic inflammatory diseases. Important among these diseases is atherosclerosis, which refers to focal lesions in the arterial intima driven by elevated apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, notably low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and characterized by the formation of a plaque composed of inflammatory immune cells, a collection of dead cells and lipids called the necrotic core, and a fibrous cap. As the disease progresses, the necrotic core expands, and the fibrous cap becomes thin, which increases the risk of plaque rupture or erosion. Plaque rupture leads to a rapid thrombotic response that can give rise to heart attack, stroke, or sudden death. With marked lowering of circulating LDL, however, plaques become more stable and cardiac risk is lowered-a process known as atherosclerosis regression. A critical aspect of both atherosclerosis progression and regression is the crosstalk between innate (myeloid cells) and adaptive (T-lymphocytes) immune cells. Myeloid cells are specialized at clearing apoptotic cells by a process called efferocytosis, which is necessary for inflammation resolution. In advanced disease, efferocytosis is impaired, leading to secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells, inflammation, and, most importantly, defective tissue resolution. In regression, efferocytosis is reawakened aiding in inflammation resolution and plaque stabilization. Here, we will explore how efferocytosing myeloid cells could affect T-cell function and vice versa through antigen presentation, secreted factors, and cell-cell contacts and how this cellular crosstalk may contribute to the progression or regression of atherosclerosis.",

        "Abstract": "The process of dead cell clearance by phagocytic cells, called efferocytosis, prevents inflammatory cell necrosis and promotes resolution and repair. Defective efferocytosis contributes to the progression of numerous diseases in which cell death is prominent, including liver disease. Many gaps remain in our understanding of how hepatic macrophages carry out efferocytosis and how this process goes awry in various types of liver diseases. Thus far, studies have suggested that, upon liver injury, liver-resident Kupffer cells and infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages clear dead cells, limit inflammation, and, through macrophage reprogramming, repair liver damage. However, in unusual settings, efferocytosis can promote liver disease. In this review, we will focus on efferocytosis in various types of acute and chronic liver diseases, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. Understanding the mechanisms and consequences of efferocytosis by hepatic macrophages has the potential to shed new light on liver disease pathophysiology and to guide new treatment strategies to prevent disease progression.",

        "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is emerging as the most common cause of liver disease. Although many studies in mouse NASH models have suggested therapies, translation to humans is poor, with no approved drugs for NASH. One explanation may lie in differences between mouse and human hepatocytes. We used NASH diet-fed chimeric mice reconstituted with human hepatocytes (hu-liver mice) to test a mechanism-based hepatocyte-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA), GalNAc-siTaz, shown previously to block the progression to fibrotic NASH in mice. Following ablation of endogenous hepatocytes, male mice were reconstituted with human hepatocytes from a single donor with the rs738409-C/G PNPLA3 risk variant, resulting in \u223c95% human hepatocyte reconstitution. The mice were then fed a high-fat choline-deficient l-amino acid-defined diet for 6\u00a0weeks to induce NASH, followed by six weekly injections of GalNAc-siTAZ to silence hepatocyte-TAZ or control GalNAc-siRNA (GalNAc-control) while still on the NASH diet. GalNAc-siTAZ lowered human hepatic TAZ and IHH, a TAZ target that promotes NASH fibrosis. Most important, GalNAc-siTAZ decreased liver inflammation, hepatocellular injury, hepatic fibrosis, and profibrogenic mediator expression versus GalNAc-control, indicating that GalNAc-siTAZ decreased the progression of NASH in mice reconstituted with human hepatocytes. In conclusion, silencing TAZ in human hepatocytes suppresses liver fibrosis in a hu-liver model of NASH.",

        "Abstract": "The clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages (efferocytosis) prevents necrosis and inflammation and activates pro-resolving pathways, including continual efferocytosis. A key resolution process in vivo is efferocytosis-induced macrophage proliferation (EIMP), in which apoptotic cell-derived nucleotides trigger Myc-mediated proliferation of pro-resolving macrophages. Here we show that EIMP requires a second input that is integrated with cellular metabolism, notably efferocytosis-induced lactate production. Lactate signalling via GPR132 promotes Myc protein stabilization and subsequent macrophage proliferation. This mechanism is validated in vivo using a mouse model of dexamethasone-induced thymocyte apoptosis, which elevates apoptotic cell burden and requires efferocytosis to prevent inflammation and necrosis. Thus, EIMP, a key process in tissue resolution, requires inputs from two independent processes: a signalling pathway induced by apoptotic cell-derived nucleotides and a cellular metabolism pathway involving lactate production. These findings illustrate how seemingly distinct pathways in efferocytosing macrophages are integrated to carry out a key process in tissue resolution.",

        "Abstract": "Apolipoprotein B (apoB)-lipoproteins initiate and promote atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Plasma tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity is negatively associated with atherogenic apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol levels in humans, but the mechanisms are unknown. We found that tPA, partially through the lysine-binding site on its Kringle 2 domain, binds to the N terminus of apoB, blocking the interaction between apoB and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in hepatocytes, thereby reducing very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly and plasma apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) sequesters tPA away from apoB and increases VLDL assembly. Humans with PAI-1 deficiency have smaller VLDL particles and lower plasma levels of apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol. These results suggest a mechanism that fine-tunes VLDL assembly by intracellular interactions among tPA, PAI-1, and apoB in hepatocytes.",

        "Abstract": "The phagocytosis of dying cells by macrophages, termed efferocytosis, is a tightly regulated process that involves the sensing, binding, engulfment, and digestion of apoptotic cells. Efferocytosis not only prevents tissue necrosis and inflammation caused by secondary necrosis of dying cells, but it also promotes pro-resolving signaling in macrophages, which is essential for tissue resolution and repair following injury or inflammation. An important factor that contributes to this pro-resolving reprogramming is the cargo that is released from apoptotic cells after their engulfment and phagolysosomal digestion by macrophages. The apoptotic cell cargo contains amino acids, nucleotides, fatty acids, and cholesterol that function as metabolites and signaling molecules to bring about this re-programming. Here, we review efferocytosis-induced changes in macrophage metabolism that mediate the pro-resolving functions of macrophages. We also discuss various strategies, challenges, and future perspectives related to drugging efferocytosis-fueled macrophage metabolism as strategy to dampen inflammation and promote resolution in chronic inflammatory diseases.",

A pro-fibrotic process relevant to human NASH involves a pathway in which a transcriptional regulator called TAZ (WWTR1) in hepatocytes induces the secretion of pro-fibrotic Indian hedgehog (IHH). We therefore reasoned that circulating IHH may be a useful mechanism-based marker to assess changes in NASH fibrosis.",

        "Abstract": "Resolving-type macrophages prevent chronic inflammation by clearing apoptotic cells through efferocytosis. These macrophages are thought to rely mainly on oxidative phosphorylation, but emerging evidence suggests a possible link between efferocytosis and glycolysis. To gain further insight into this issue, we investigated molecular-cellular mechanisms involved in efferocytosis-induced macrophage glycolysis and its consequences. We found that efferocytosis promotes a transient increase in macrophage glycolysis that is dependent on rapid activation of the enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 2 (PFKFB2), which distinguishes this process from glycolysis in pro-inflammatory macrophages. Mice transplanted with activation-defective PFKFB2 bone marrow and then subjected to dexamethasone-induced thymocyte apoptosis exhibit impaired thymic efferocytosis, increased thymic necrosis, and lower expression of the efferocytosis receptors MerTK and LRP1 on thymic macrophages compared with wild-type control mice. In vitro mechanistic studies revealed that glycolysis stimulated by the uptake of a first apoptotic cell promotes continual efferocytosis through lactate-mediated upregulation of MerTK and LRP1. Thus, efferocytosis-induced macrophage glycolysis represents a unique metabolic process that sustains continual efferocytosis in a lactate-dependent manner. The differentiation of this process from inflammatory macrophage glycolysis raises the possibility that it could be therapeutically enhanced to promote efferocytosis and resolution in chronic inflammatory diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Phagocytic clearance of dying cells, termed efferocytosis, is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis, yet our understanding of efferocytosis regulation remains incomplete. Here we perform a FACS-based, genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in primary mouse macrophages to search for novel regulators of efferocytosis. The results show that Wdfy3 knockout in macrophages specifically impairs uptake, but not binding, of apoptotic cells due to defective actin disassembly. Additionally, WDFY3 interacts with GABARAP, thus facilitating LC3 lipidation and subsequent lysosomal acidification to permit the degradation of apoptotic cell components. Mechanistically, while the C-terminus of WDFY3 is sufficient to rescue the impaired degradation induced by Wdfy3 knockout, full-length WDFY3 is required to reconstitute the uptake of apoptotic cells. Finally, WDFY3 is also required for efficient efferocytosis in vivo in mice and in vitro in primary human macrophages. This work thus expands our knowledge of the mechanisms of macrophage efferocytosis, as well as supports genome-wide CRISPR screen as a platform for interrogating complex functional phenotypes in primary macrophages.",

        "Abstract": "Necroptosis contributes to hepatocyte death in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the fate and roles of necroptotic hepatocytes (necHCs) in NASH remain unknown. We show here that the accumulation of necHCs in human and mouse NASH liver is associated with an up-regulation of the \"don't-eat-me\" ligand CD47 on necHCs, but not on apoptotic hepatocytes, and an increase in the CD47 receptor SIRP\u03b1 on liver macrophages, consistent with impaired macrophage-mediated clearance of necHCs. In vitro, necHC clearance by primary liver macrophages was enhanced by treatment with either anti-CD47 or anti-SIRP\u03b1. In a proof-of-concept mouse model of inducible hepatocyte necroptosis, anti-CD47 antibody treatment increased necHC uptake by liver macrophages and inhibited markers of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, which is responsible for liver fibrogenesis. Treatment of two mouse models of diet-induced NASH with anti-CD47, anti-SIRP\u03b1, or AAV8-H1-shCD47 to silence CD47 in hepatocytes increased the uptake of necHC by liver macrophages and decreased markers of HSC activation and liver fibrosis. Anti-SIRP\u03b1 treatment avoided the adverse effect of anemia found in anti-CD47-treated mice. These findings provide evidence that impaired clearance of necHCs by liver macrophages due to CD47-SIRP\u03b1 up-regulation contributes to fibrotic NASH, and suggest therapeutic blockade of the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 axis as a strategy to decrease the accumulation of necHCs in NASH liver and dampen the progression of hepatic fibrosis.",

        "Abstract": "Fibrosis contributes to ~45% of deaths in western countries. In chronic liver disease, fibrosis is a major factor determining outcomes, but efficient antifibrotic therapies are lacking. Although platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 constitute key fibrogenic mediators, they do not account for the well-established link between cell death and fibrosis in the liver. Here, we hypothesized that damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) may link epithelial cell death to fibrogenesis in the injured liver. DAMP receptor screening identified purinergic receptor P2Y14 among several candidates as highly enriched in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the main fibrogenic cell type of the liver. Conversely, P2Y14 ligands uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP)-glucose and UDP-galactose were enriched in hepatocytes and were released upon different modes of cell death. Accordingly, ligand-receptor interaction analysis that combined proteomic and single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed P2Y14 ligands and P2Y14 receptor as a link between dying cells and HSCs, respectively. Treatment with P2Y14 ligands or coculture with dying hepatocytes promoted HSC activation in a P2Y14-dependent manner. P2Y14 ligands activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling in HSCs, resulting in ERK-dependent HSC activation. Global and HSC-selective P2Y14 deficiency attenuated liver fibrosis in multiple mouse models of liver injury. Functional expression of P2Y14 was confirmed in healthy and diseased human liver and human HSCs. In conclusion, P2Y14 ligands and their receptor constitute a profibrogenic DAMP pathway that directly links cell death to fibrogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Apoptotic cell clearance by macrophages (efferocytosis) promotes resolution signaling pathways, which can be triggered by molecules derived from the phagolysosomal degradation of apoptotic cells. We show here that nucleotides derived from the hydrolysis of apoptotic cell DNA by phagolysosomal DNase2a activate a DNA-PKcs-mTORC2/Rictor pathway that increases Myc to promote non-inflammatory macrophage proliferation. Efferocytosis-induced proliferation expands the pool of resolving macrophages in\u00a0vitro and in mice, including zymosan-induced peritonitis, dexamethasone-induced thymocyte apoptosis, and atherosclerosis regression. In the dexamethasone-thymus model, hematopoietic Rictor deletion blocked efferocytosing macrophage proliferation, apoptotic cell clearance, and tissue resolution. In atherosclerosis regression, silencing macrophage Rictor or DNase2a blocked efferocyte proliferation, apoptotic cell clearance, and plaque stabilization. In view of previous work showing that other types of apoptotic cell cargo can promote resolution in individual efferocytosing macrophages, the findings here suggest that signaling-triggered apoptotic cell-derived nucleotides can amplify this benefit by increasing the number of these macrophages.",

        "Abstract": "Nanotechnology could improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and contribute to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Macrophages have key roles in atherosclerosis progression and, therefore, macrophage-associated pathological processes are important targets for both diagnostic imaging and novel therapies for atherosclerosis. In this Review, we highlight efforts in the past two decades to develop imaging techniques and to therapeutically manipulate macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques with the use of rationally designed nanoparticles. We review the latest progress in nanoparticle-based imaging modalities that can specifically target macrophages. Using novel molecular imaging technology, these modalities enable the identification of advanced atherosclerotic plaques and the assessment of the therapeutic efficacy of medical interventions. Additionally, we provide novel perspectives on how macrophage-targeting nanoparticles can deliver a broad range of therapeutic payloads to atherosclerotic lesions. These nanoparticles can suppress pro-atherogenic macrophage processes, leading to improved resolution of inflammation and stabilization of plaques. Finally, we propose future opportunities for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and provide solutions to challenges in this area for the purpose of accelerating the clinical translation of nanomedicine for the treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease.",

        "Abstract": "Atherosclerotic vascular disease resulting from unstable plaques is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and thus a major therapeutic goal is to discover T2D drugs that can also promote atherosclerotic plaque stability. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2 or MK2) in obese mice improves glucose homeostasis and enhances insulin sensitivity. We developed two novel orally active small-molecule inhibitors of MK2, TBX-1 and TBX-2, and tested their effects on metabolism and atherosclerosis in high-fat Western diet (WD)-fed Ldlr-/- mice. Ldlr-/- mice were first fed the WD to allow atherosclerotic lesions to become established, and the mice were then treated with TBX-1 or TBX-2. Both compounds improved glucose metabolism and lowered plasma cholesterol and triglyceride, without an effect on body weight. Most importantly, the compounds decreased lesion area, lessened plaque necrosis, and increased fibrous cap thickness in the aortic root lesions of the mice. Thus, in a preclinical model of high-fat feeding and established atherosclerosis, MK2 inhibitors improved metabolism and also enhanced atherosclerotic plaque stability, suggesting potential for further clinical development to address the epidemic of T2D associated with atherosclerotic vascular disease.",

        "Abstract": "Efferocytosis, the process through which apoptotic cells (ACs) are cleared through actin-mediated engulfment by macrophages, prevents secondary necrosis, suppresses inflammation, and promotes resolution. Impaired efferocytosis drives the formation of clinically dangerous necrotic atherosclerotic plaques, the underlying etiology of coronary artery disease (CAD). An intron of the gene encoding PHACTR1 contains rs9349379 (A>G), a common variant associated with CAD. As PHACTR1 is an actin-binding protein, we reasoned that if the rs9349379 risk allele G causes lower PHACTR1 expression in macrophages, it might link the risk allele to CAD via impaired efferocytosis. We show here that rs9349379-G/G was associated with lower levels of PHACTR1 and impaired efferocytosis in human monocyte-derived macrophages and human atherosclerotic lesional macrophages compared with rs9349379-A/A. Silencing PHACTR1 in human and mouse macrophages compromised AC engulfment, and Western diet-fed Ldlr-/- mice in which hematopoietic Phactr1 was genetically targeted showed impaired lesional efferocytosis, increased plaque necrosis, and thinner fibrous caps - all signs of vulnerable plaques in humans. Mechanistically, PHACTR1 prevented dephosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), which was necessary for AC engulfment. In summary, rs9349379-G lowered PHACTR1, which, by lowering phospho-MLC, compromised efferocytosis. Thus, rs9349379-G may contribute to CAD risk, at least in part, by impairing atherosclerotic lesional macrophage efferocytosis.",

        "Abstract": "Tyro3, AXL, and MerTK (TAM) receptors are activated in macrophages in response to tissue injury and as such have been proposed as therapeutic targets to promote inflammation resolution during sterile wound healing, including myocardial infarction. Although the role of MerTK in cardioprotection is well characterized, the unique role of the other structurally similar TAMs, and particularly AXL, in clinically relevant models of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion infarction (IRI) is comparatively unknown. Utilizing complementary approaches, validated by flow cytometric analysis of human and murine macrophage subsets and conditional genetic loss and gain of function, we uncover a maladaptive role for myeloid AXL during IRI in the heart. Cross signaling between AXL and TLR4 in cardiac macrophages directed a switch to glycolytic metabolism and secretion of proinflammatory IL-1\u03b2, leading to increased intramyocardial inflammation, adverse ventricular remodeling, and impaired contractile function. AXL functioned independently of cardioprotective MerTK to reduce the efficacy of cardiac repair, but like MerTK, was proteolytically cleaved. Administration of a selective small molecule AXL inhibitor alone improved cardiac healing, which was further enhanced in combination with blockade of MerTK cleavage. These data support further exploration of macrophage TAM receptors as therapeutic targets for myocardial infarction.",

        "Abstract": "ODC (ornithine decarboxylase)-dependent putrescine synthesis promotes the successive clearance of apoptotic cells (ACs) by macrophages, contributing to inflammation resolution. However, it remains unknown whether ODC is required for other arms of the resolution program. Approach and Results: RNA sequencing of ODC-deficient macrophages exposed to ACs showed increases in mRNAs associated with heightened inflammation and decreases in mRNAs related to resolution and repair compared with WT (wild type) macrophages. In zymosan peritonitis, myeloid ODC deletion led to delayed clearance of neutrophils and a decrease in the proresolving cytokine, IL (interleukin)-10. Nanoparticle-mediated silencing of macrophage ODC in a model of atherosclerosis regression lowered IL-10 expression, decreased efferocytosis, enhanced necrotic core area, and reduced fibrous cap thickness. Mechanistically, ODC deletion lowered basal expression of MerTK (MER tyrosine-protein kinase)-an AC receptor-via a histone methylation-dependent transcriptional mechanism. Owing to lower basal MerTK, subsequent exposure to ACs resulted in lower MerTK-Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) 1/2-dependent IL-10 production. Putrescine treatment of ODC-deficient macrophages restored the expression of both MerTK and AC-induced IL-10.",

        "Abstract": "With the rapid expansion of the obesity epidemic, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is now the most common chronic liver disease, with almost 25% global prevalence. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ranges in severity from simple steatosis, a benign 'pre-disease' state, to the liver injury and inflammation that characterize nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which in turn predisposes individuals to liver fibrosis. Fibrosis is the major determinant of clinical outcomes in patients with NASH and is associated with increased risks of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH has no approved therapies, and liver fibrosis shows poor response to existing pharmacotherapy, in part due to an incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. Patient and mouse data have shown that NASH is associated with the activation of developmental pathways: Notch, Hedgehog and Hippo-YAP-TAZ. Although these evolutionarily conserved fundamental signals are known to determine liver morphogenesis during development, new data have shown a coordinated and causal role for these pathways in the liver injury response, which becomes maladaptive during obesity-associated chronic liver disease. In this Review, we discuss the aetiology of this reactivation of developmental pathways and review the cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous mechanisms by which developmental pathways influence disease progression. Finally, we discuss the potential prognostic and therapeutic implications of these data for NASH and liver fibrosis.",

        "Abstract": "Fibrinolysis is initiated by tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and inhibited by plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). In obese humans, plasma PAI-1 and tPA proteins are increased, but PAI-1 dominates, leading to reduced fibrinolysis and thrombosis. To understand tPA-PAI-1 regulation in obesity, we focused on hepatocytes, a functionally important source of tPA and PAI-1 that sense obesity-induced metabolic stress. We showed that obese mice, like humans, had reduced fibrinolysis and increased plasma PAI-1 and tPA, due largely to their increased hepatocyte expression. A decrease in the PAI-1 (SERPINE1) gene corepressor Rev-Erb\u03b1 increased PAI-1, which then increased the tPA gene PLAT via a PAI-1/LRP1/PKA/p-CREB1 pathway. This pathway was partially counterbalanced by increased DACH1, a PLAT-negative regulator. We focused on the PAI-1/PLAT pathway, which mitigates the reduction in fibrinolysis in obesity. Thus, silencing hepatocyte PAI-1, CREB1, or tPA in obese mice lowered plasma tPA and further impaired fibrinolysis. The PAI-1/PLAT pathway was present in primary human hepatocytes, and associations among PAI-1, tPA, and PLAT in livers from obese and lean humans were consistent with these findings. Knowledge of PAI-1 and tPA regulation in hepatocytes in obesity may suggest therapeutic strategies for improving fibrinolysis and lowering the risk of thrombosis in this setting.",

        "Abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with diabetes, and tight glycemic control fails to reduce the risk of developing CVD. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a class of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) agonists, are potent insulin sensitizers with antiatherogenic properties, but their clinical use is limited by side effects. PPAR\u03b3 deacetylation on two lysine residues (K268 and K293) induces brown remodeling of white adipose tissue and uncouples the adverse effects of TZDs from insulin sensitization. Here we show that PPAR\u03b3 deacetylation confers antiatherogenic properties and retains the insulin-sensitizing effects of TZD while circumventing its detriments. We generated mice homozygous with mice with deacetylation-mimetic PPAR\u03b3 mutations K268R/K293R (2KR) on an LDL-receptor knockout (",

        "Abstract": "Incomplete understanding of how hepatosteatosis transitions to fibrotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has limited therapeutic options. Two molecules that are elevated in hepatocytes in human NASH liver are cholesterol, whose mechanistic link to NASH remains incompletely understood, and TAZ, a transcriptional regulator that promotes fibrosis but whose mechanism of increase in NASH is unknown. We now show that increased hepatocyte\u00a0cholesterol upregulates TAZ and promotes fibrotic NASH. ASTER-B/C-mediated internalization of plasma membrane cholesterol activates soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC; ADCY10), triggering a calcium-RhoA-mediated pathway that suppresses \u03b2-TrCP/proteasome-mediated TAZ degradation. In mice fed with a cholesterol-rich NASH-inducing diet, hepatocyte-specific silencing of ASTER-B/C, sAC, or RhoA decreased TAZ and ameliorated fibrotic NASH. The cholesterol-TAZ pathway is present in primary human hepatocytes, and associations among liver cholesterol, TAZ, and RhoA in human NASH liver are consistent with the pathway. Thus, hepatocyte cholesterol contributes to fibrotic NASH by increasing TAZ, suggesting new targets for therapeutic intervention.",

        "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most prevalent liver disease worldwide, affecting 20%-25% of the adult population. In 25% of patients, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which increases the risk for the development of cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In patients with NASH, liver fibrosis is the main determinant of mortality. Here, we review how interactions between different liver cells culminate in fibrosis development in NASH, focusing on triggers and consequences of hepatocyte-macrophage-hepatic stellate cell (HSC) crosstalk. We discuss pathways through which stressed and dead hepatocytes instigate the profibrogenic crosstalk with HSC and macrophages, including the reactivation of developmental pathways such as TAZ, Notch, and hedgehog; how clearance of dead cells in NASH via efferocytosis may affect inflammation and fibrogenesis; and insights into HSC and macrophage heterogeneity revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing. Finally, we summarize options to therapeutically interrupt this profibrogenic hepatocyte-macrophage-HSC network in NASH.",

        "Abstract": "Continual efferocytic clearance of apoptotic cells (ACs) by macrophages prevents necrosis and promotes injury resolution. How continual efferocytosis is promoted is not clear. Here, we show that the process is optimized by linking the metabolism of engulfed cargo from initial efferocytic events to subsequent rounds. We found that continual efferocytosis is enhanced by the metabolism of AC-derived arginine and ornithine to putrescine by macrophage arginase 1 (Arg1) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Putrescine augments HuR-mediated stabilization of the mRNA encoding the GTP-exchange factor Dbl, which activates actin-regulating Rac1 to facilitate subsequent rounds of AC internalization. Inhibition of any step along this pathway after first-AC uptake suppresses second-AC internalization, whereas putrescine addition rescues this defect. Mice lacking myeloid Arg1 or ODC have defects in efferocytosis in\u00a0vivo and in atherosclerosis regression, while treatment with putrescine promotes atherosclerosis resolution. Thus, macrophage metabolism of AC-derived metabolites allows for optimal continual efferocytosis and resolution of injury.",

        "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is emerging as a leading cause of chronic liver disease. However, therapeutic options are limited by incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of NASH fibrosis, which is mediated by activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In humans, human genetic studies have shown that hypomorphic variations in MERTK, encoding the macrophage c-mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) receptor, provide protection against liver fibrosis, but the mechanisms remain unknown. We now show that holo- or myeloid-specific Mertk targeting in NASH mice decreases liver fibrosis, congruent with the human genetic data. Furthermore, ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17)-mediated MerTK cleavage in liver macrophages decreases during steatosis to NASH transition, and mice with a cleavage-resistant MerTK mutant have increased NASH fibrosis. Macrophage MerTK promotes an ERK-TGF\u03b21 pathway that activates HSCs and induces liver fibrosis. These data provide insights into the role of liver macrophages in NASH fibrosis and provide a plausible mechanism underlying MERTK as a genetic risk factor for NASH fibrosis.",

        "Abstract": "The clearance of apoptotic cells by professional and non-professional phagocytes - a process termed 'efferocytosis' - is essential for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Accordingly, defective efferocytosis underlies a growing list of chronic inflammatory diseases. Although much has been learnt about the mechanisms of apoptotic cell recognition and uptake, several key areas remain incompletely understood. This Review focuses on new discoveries related to how phagocytes process the metabolic cargo they receive during apoptotic cell uptake; the links between efferocytosis and the resolution of inflammation in health and disease; and the roles of efferocytosis in host defence. Understanding these aspects of efferocytosis sheds light on key physiological and pathophysiological processes and suggests novel therapeutic strategies for diseases driven by defective efferocytosis and impaired inflammation resolution.",

        "Abstract": "Macrophage polarization is critical to inflammation and resolution of inflammation. We previously showed that high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) can engage receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) to direct monocytes to a proinflammatory phenotype characterized by production of type 1 IFN and proinflammatory cytokines. In contrast, HMGB1 plus C1q form a tetramolecular complex cross-linking RAGE and LAIR-1 and directing monocytes to an antiinflammatory phenotype. Lipid mediators, as well as cytokines, help establish a milieu favoring either inflammation or resolution of inflammation. This study focuses on the induction of lipid mediators by HMGB1 and HMGB1 plus C1q and their regulation of IRF5, a transcription factor critical for the induction and maintenance of proinflammatory macrophages. Here, we show that HMGB1 induces leukotriene production through a RAGE-dependent pathway, while HMGB1 plus C1q induces specialized proresolving lipid mediators lipoxin A4, resolvin D1, and resolvin D2 through a RAGE- and LAIR-1-dependent pathway. Leukotriene exposure contributes to induction of IRF5 in a positive-feedback loop. In contrast, resolvins (at 20 nM) block IRF5 induction and prevent the differentiation of inflammatory macrophages. Finally, we have generated a molecular mimic of HMGB1 plus C1q, which cross-links RAGE and LAIR-1 and polarizes monocytes to an antiinflammatory phenotype. These findings may provide a mechanism to control nonresolving inflammation in many pathologic conditions.",

Since their discovery in the early 1990s, they have been studied for their ability to influence numerous diseases, including cancer, chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. The TAM receptors demonstrate an ability to influence multiple aspects of cardiovascular pathology via their diverse effects on cells of both the vasculature and the immune system. In this review, we will explore the various functions of the TAM receptors and how they influence cardiovascular disease through regulation of vascular remodelling, efferocytosis and inflammation. Based on this information, we will suggest areas in which further research is required and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",

        "Title": "Inflammation and its resolution in atherosclerosis: mediators and therapeutic opportunities.",
        "Abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven inflammatory disease of the arterial intima in which the balance of pro-inflammatory and inflammation-resolving mechanisms dictates the final clinical outcome. Intimal infiltration and modification of plasma-derived lipoproteins and their uptake mainly by macrophages, with ensuing formation of lipid-filled foam cells, initiate atherosclerotic lesion formation, and deficient efferocytotic removal of apoptotic cells and foam cells sustains lesion progression. Defective efferocytosis, as a sign of inadequate inflammation resolution, leads to accumulation of secondarily necrotic macrophages and foam cells and the formation of an advanced lesion with a necrotic lipid core, indicative of plaque vulnerability. Resolution of inflammation is mediated by specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators derived from omega-3 fatty acids or arachidonic acid and by relevant proteins and signalling gaseous molecules. One of the major effects of inflammation resolution mediators is phenotypic conversion of pro-inflammatory macrophages into macrophages that suppress inflammation and promote healing. In advanced atherosclerotic lesions, the ratio between specialized pro-resolving mediators and pro-inflammatory lipids (in particular leukotrienes) is strikingly low, providing a molecular explanation for the defective inflammation resolution features of these lesions. In this Review, we\u00a0discuss the mechanisms of the formation of clinically dangerous atherosclerotic lesions and the potential of pro-resolving mediator therapy to inhibit this process.",

        "Title": "LXR Suppresses Inflammatory Gene Expression and Neutrophil Migration through cis-Repression and Cholesterol Efflux.",
        "Abstract": "The activation of liver X receptor (LXR) promotes cholesterol efflux and repression of inflammatory genes with anti-atherogenic consequences. The mechanisms underlying the repressive activity of LXR are controversial and have been attributed to cholesterol efflux or to transrepression of activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity. Here, we find that cholesterol efflux contributes to LXR repression, while the\u00a0direct repressive functions of LXR also play a key role but are independent of AP-1. We use assay\u00a0for\u00a0transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to show that LXR reduces chromatin accessibility in cis at inflammatory gene enhancers containing LXR binding sites. Targets of this repressive activity are associated with leukocyte adhesion and neutrophil migration, and LXR agonist treatment suppresses neutrophil recruitment in a mouse model of sterile peritonitis. These studies suggest a model of repression in which liganded LXR binds in cis to canonical nuclear receptor binding sites and represses pro-atherogenic leukocyte functions in tandem with the induction of LXR targets mediating cholesterol efflux.",

        "Abstract": "Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is a major mediator of fibrinolysis and, thereby, prevents excessive coagulation without compromising hemostasis. Studies on tPA regulation have focused on its acute local release by vascular cells in response to injury or other stimuli. However, very little is known about sources, regulation, and fibrinolytic function of noninjury-induced systemic plasma tPA. We explore the role and regulation of hepatocyte-derived tPA as a source of basal plasma tPA activity and as a contributor to fibrinolysis after vascular injury. We show that hepatocyte tPA is downregulated by a pathway in which the corepressor DACH1 represses ATF6, which is an inducer of the tPA gene ",

Here, we report that hepatocyte Notch activity tracks with disease severity and treatment response in patients with NASH and is similarly increased in a mouse model of diet-induced NASH and liver fibrosis. Hepatocyte-specific Notch loss-of-function mouse models showed attenuated NASH-associated liver fibrosis, demonstrating causality to obesity-induced liver pathology. Conversely, forced activation of hepatocyte Notch induced fibrosis in both chow- and NASH diet-fed mice by increasing Sox9-dependent Osteopontin (Opn) expression and secretion from hepatocytes, which activate resident hepatic stellate cells. In a cross-sectional study, we found that OPN explains the positive correlation between liver Notch activity and fibrosis stage in patients. Further, we developed a Notch inhibitor [",

        "Abstract": "Atherosclerosis is characterized by the retention of modified lipoproteins in the arterial wall. These modified lipoproteins activate resident macrophages and the recruitment of monocyte-derived cells, which differentiate into mononuclear phagocytes that ingest the deposited lipoproteins to become \"foam cells\": a hallmark of this disease. In this Part 2 of a 4-part review series covering the macrophage in cardiovascular disease, we critically review the contributions and relevant pathobiology of monocytes, macrophages, and foam cells as relevant to atherosclerosis. We also review evidence that via various pathways, a failure of the resolution of inflammation is an additional key aspect of this disease process. Finally, we consider the\u00a0likely role played by genomics and biological networks in controlling the macrophage phenotype in atherosclerosis. Collectively, these data provide substantial insights on the atherosclerotic process, while concurrently offering numerous molecular and genomic candidates that appear to hold great promise for selective targeting as clinical therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Regulatory T (Treg) cell responses and apoptotic cell clearance (efferocytosis) represent critical arms of the inflammation resolution response. We sought to determine whether these processes might be linked through Treg-cell-mediated enhancement of efferocytosis. In zymosan-induced peritonitis and lipopolysaccharide-induced\u00a0lung injury, Treg cells increased early in resolution, and Treg cell depletion decreased efferocytosis. In advanced atherosclerosis, where defective efferocytosis drives disease progression, Treg cell expansion improved efferocytosis. Mechanistic\u00a0studies revealed the following sequence: (1)\u00a0Treg cells secreted interleukin-13 (IL-13), which stimulated IL-10 production in macrophages; (2) autocrine-paracrine signaling by IL-10 induced Vav1 in macrophages; and (3) Vav1 activated Rac1 to promote apoptotic cell engulfment. In summary, Treg cells promote macrophage efferocytosis during inflammation resolution via a transcellular signaling pathway that enhances apoptotic cell internalization. These findings suggest an expanded role of Treg cells in inflammation resolution and provide a mechanistic basis for Treg-cell-enhancement strategies for non-resolving inflammatory diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammation resolution counterbalances excessive inflammation and restores tissue homeostasis after injury. Failure of resolution contributes to the pathology of numerous chronic inflammatory diseases. Resolution is mediated by endogenous specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), which are derived from long-chain fatty acids by lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. 5-LOX plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of two classes of SPMs: lipoxins and resolvins. Cytoplasmic localization of the nonphosphorylated form of 5-LOX is essential for SPM biosynthesis, whereas nuclear localization of phosphorylated 5-LOX promotes proinflammatory leukotriene production. We previously showed that MerTK, an efferocytosis receptor on macrophages, promotes SPM biosynthesis by increasing the abundance of nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic 5-LOX. We now show that activation of MerTK in human macrophages led to ERK-mediated expression of the gene encoding sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2), which decreased the cytosolic Ca",

        "Abstract": "Non-resolving inflammation drives the development of clinically dangerous atherosclerotic lesions by promoting sustained plaque inflammation, large necrotic cores, thin fibrous caps, and thrombosis. Resolution of inflammation is not merely a passive return to homeostasis, but rather an active process mediated by specific molecules, including fatty acid-derived specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). In advanced atherosclerosis, there is an imbalance between levels of SPMs and proinflammatory lipid mediators, which results in sustained leukocyte influx into lesions, inflammatory macrophage polarization, and impaired efferocytosis. In animal models of advanced atherosclerosis, restoration of SPMs limits plaque progression by suppressing inflammation, enhancing efferocytosis, and promoting an increase in collagen cap thickness. This Review discusses the roles of non-resolving inflammation in atherosclerosis and highlights the unique therapeutic potential of SPMs in blocking the progression of clinically dangerous plaques.",

        "Abstract": "Emerging data suggest that hypercholesterolemia has stimulatory effects on adaptive immunity and that these effects can promote atherosclerosis and perhaps other inflammatory diseases. However, research in this area has relied primarily on inbred strains of mice whose adaptive immune system can differ substantially from that of humans. Moreover, the genetically induced hypercholesterolemia in these models typically results in plasma cholesterol levels that are much higher than those in most humans. To overcome these obstacles, we studied human immune system-reconstituted mice (hu-mice) rendered hypercholesterolemic by treatment with adeno-associated virus 8-proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (AAV8-PCSK9) and a high-fat/high-cholesterol Western-type diet (WD). These mice had a high percentage of human T cells and moderate hypercholesterolemia. Compared with hu-mice that had lower plasma cholesterol, the PCSK9-WD mice developed a T cell-mediated inflammatory response in the lung and liver. Human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells bearing an effector memory phenotype were significantly elevated in the blood, spleen, and lungs of PCSK9-WD hu-mice, whereas splenic and circulating regulatory T cells were reduced. These data show that moderately high plasma cholesterol can disrupt human T cell homeostasis in vivo. This process may not only exacerbate atherosclerosis, but also contribute to T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases in the hypercholesterolemia setting.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity-induced metabolic disease involves functional integration among several organs via circulating factors, but little is known about crosstalk between liver and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). In obesity, VAT becomes populated with inflammatory adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). In obese humans, there is a close correlation between adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance, and in obese mice, blocking systemic or ATM inflammation improves insulin sensitivity. However, processes that promote pathological adipose tissue inflammation in obesity are incompletely understood. Here we show that obesity in mice stimulates hepatocytes to synthesize and secrete dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which acts with plasma factor Xa to inflame ATMs. Silencing expression of DPP4 in hepatocytes suppresses inflammation of VAT and insulin resistance; however, a similar effect is not seen with the orally administered DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin. Inflammation and insulin resistance are also suppressed by silencing expression of caveolin-1 or PAR2 in ATMs; these proteins mediate the actions of DPP4 and factor Xa, respectively. Thus, hepatocyte DPP4 promotes VAT inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity, and targeting this pathway may have metabolic benefits that are distinct from those observed with oral DPP4 inhibitors.",

        "Abstract": "Efficient clearance of apoptotic cells, termed efferocytosis, critically regulates normal homeostasis whereas defective uptake of apoptotic cells results in chronic and non-resolving inflammatory diseases, such as advanced atherosclerosis. Monocyte-derived macrophages recruited into developing atherosclerotic lesions initially display efficient efferocytosis and temper inflammatory responses, processes that restrict plaque progression. However, during the course of plaque development, macrophages undergo cellular reprogramming that reduces efferocytic capacity, which results in post-apoptotic necrosis of apoptotic cells and inflammation. Furthermore, defective efferocytosis in advanced atherosclerosis is a major driver of necrotic core formation, which can trigger plaque rupture and acute thrombotic cardiovascular events. In this review, we discuss the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate efferocytosis, how efferocytosis promotes the resolution of inflammation, and how defective efferocytosis leads to the formation of clinically dangerous atherosclerotic plaques.",

The lipoproteins acquire features of damage-associated molecular patterns and trigger first an innate immune response, dominated by monocyte-macrophages, and then an adaptive immune response. These inflammatory responses often become chronic and non-resolving and can lead to arterial damage and thrombosis-induced organ infarction. The innate immune response is regulated at various stages, from hematopoiesis to monocyte changes and macrophage activation. The adaptive immune response is regulated primarily by mechanisms that affect the balance between regulatory and effector T\u00a0cells. Mechanisms related to\u00a0cellular cholesterol, phenotypic plasticity, metabolism, and aging play key roles in affecting these responses. Herein, we review select topics that shed light on these processes and suggest new treatment strategies.",

        "Abstract": "Atherosclerosis is the underlying etiology of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death worldwide. Atherosclerosis is a heterogeneous disease in which only a small fraction of lesions lead to heart attack, stroke, or sudden cardiac death. A distinct type of plaque containing large necrotic cores with thin fibrous caps often precipitates these acute events. Here, we show that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase \u03b3 (CaMKII\u03b3) in macrophages plays a major role in the development of necrotic, thin-capped plaques. Macrophages in necrotic and symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques in humans as well as advanced atherosclerotic lesions in mice demonstrated activation of CaMKII. Western diet-fed LDL receptor-deficient (Ldlr-/-) mice with myeloid-specific deletion of CaMKII had smaller necrotic cores with concomitantly thicker collagen caps. These lesions demonstrated evidence of enhanced efferocytosis, which was associated with increased expression of the macrophage efferocytosis receptor MerTK. Mechanistic studies revealed that CaMKII\u03b3-deficient macrophages and atherosclerotic lesions lacking myeloid CaMKII\u03b3 had increased expression of the transcription factor ATF6. We determined that ATF6 induces liver X receptor-\u03b1 (LXR\u03b1), an Mertk-inducing transcription factor, and that increased MerTK expression and efferocytosis in CaMKII\u03b3-deficient macrophages is dependent on LXR\u03b1. These findings identify a macrophage CaMKII\u03b3/ATF6/LXR\u03b1/MerTK pathway as a key factor in the development of necrotic atherosclerotic plaques.",

        "Abstract": "Clearance of apoptotic cells (ACs) by phagocytes (efferocytosis) prevents post-apoptotic necrosis and dampens inflammation. Defective efferocytosis drives important diseases, including atherosclerosis. For efficient efferocytosis, phagocytes must be able to internalize multiple ACs. We show here that uptake of multiple ACs by macrophages requires dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission, which is triggered by AC uptake. When mitochondrial fission is disabled, AC-induced increase in cytosolic calcium is blunted owing to mitochondrial calcium sequestration, and calcium-dependent phagosome formation around secondarily encountered ACs is impaired. These defects can be corrected by silencing the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). Mice lacking myeloid Drp1 showed defective efferocytosis and its pathologic consequences in the thymus after dexamethasone treatment and in advanced atherosclerotic lesions in fat-fed Ldlr",

        "Abstract": "Defective inflammation resolution is the underlying cause of prevalent chronic inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, asthma, cancer, and neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. Inflammation resolution is governed by several endogenous factors, including fatty acid-derived specialized proresolving mediators and proteins, such as annexin A1. Specifically, specialized proresolving mediators comprise a family of mediators that include arachidonic acid-derived lipoxins, omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid-derived resolvins, docosahexaenoic acid-derived resolvins, protectins, and maresins. Emerging evidence indicates that imbalances between specialized proresolving mediators and proinflammatory mediators are associated with several prevalent human diseases, including atherosclerosis. Mechanisms that drive this imbalance remain largely unknown and will be discussed in this review. Furthermore, the concept of dysregulated inflammation resolution in atherosclerosis has been known for several decades. Recently, there has been an explosion of new work with regard to the therapeutic application of proresolving ligands in experimental atherosclerosis. Therefore, this review will highlight recent advances in our understanding of how inflammation resolution may become defective in atherosclerosis and the potential for proresolving therapeutics in atherosclerosis. Last, we offer insight for future implications of the field.",

        "Abstract": "Defective autophagy in macrophages leads to pathological processes that contribute to atherosclerosis, including impaired cholesterol metabolism and defective efferocytosis. Autophagy promotes the degradation of cytoplasmic components in lysosomes and plays a key role in the catabolism of stored lipids to maintain cellular homeostasis. microRNA-33 (miR-33) is a post-transcriptional regulator of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis, yet the complete mechanisms by which miR-33 controls lipid metabolism are unknown. We investigated whether miR-33 targeting of autophagy contributes to its regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and atherogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a leading cause of liver disease worldwide. However, the molecular basis of how benign steatosis progresses to NASH is incompletely understood, which has limited the identification of therapeutic targets. Here we show that the transcription regulator TAZ (WWTR1) is markedly higher in hepatocytes in human and murine NASH liver than in normal or steatotic liver. Most importantly, silencing of hepatocyte TAZ in murine models of NASH prevented or reversed hepatic inflammation, hepatocyte death, and fibrosis, but not steatosis. Moreover, hepatocyte-targeted expression of TAZ in a model of steatosis promoted NASH features, including fibrosis. In\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo mechanistic studies revealed that a key mechanism linking hepatocyte TAZ to NASH fibrosis is TAZ/TEA domain (TEAD)-mediated induction of Indian hedgehog (Ihh), a secretory factor that activates fibrogenic genes in hepatic stellate cells. In summary, TAZ represents a previously unrecognized factor that contributes to the critical process of steatosis-to-NASH progression.",

        "Title": "MerTK receptor cleavage promotes plaque necrosis and defective resolution in atherosclerosis.",
        "Abstract": "Atherothrombotic vascular disease is often triggered by a distinct type of atherosclerotic lesion that displays features of impaired inflammation resolution, notably a necrotic core and thinning of a protective fibrous cap that overlies the core. A key cause of plaque necrosis is defective clearance of apoptotic cells, or efferocytosis, by lesional macrophages, but the mechanisms underlying defective efferocytosis and its possible links to impaired resolution in atherosclerosis are incompletely understood. Here, we provide evidence that proteolytic cleavage of the macrophage efferocytosis receptor c-Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) reduces efferocytosis and promotes plaque necrosis and defective resolution. In human carotid plaques, MerTK cleavage correlated with plaque necrosis and the presence of ischemic symptoms. Moreover, in fat-fed LDL receptor-deficient (Ldlr-/-) mice whose myeloid cells expressed a cleavage-resistant variant of MerTK, atherosclerotic lesions exhibited higher macrophage MerTK, lower levels of the cleavage product soluble Mer, improved efferocytosis, smaller necrotic cores, thicker fibrous caps, and increased ratio of proresolving versus proinflammatory lipid mediators. These findings provide a plausible molecular-cellular mechanism that contributes to defective efferocytosis, plaque necrosis, and impaired resolution during the progression of atherosclerosis.",

        "Abstract": "Atherosclerosis is initiated by the subendothelial accumulation of apoB-lipoproteins, which initiates a sterile inflammatory response dominated by monocyte-macrophages but including all classes of innate and adaptive immune cells. These inflammatory cells, together with proliferating smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix, promote the formation of subendothelial lesions or plaques. In the vast majority of cases, these lesions do not cause serious clinical symptoms, which is due in part to a resolution-repair response that limits tissue damage. However, a deadly minority of lesions progress to the point where they can trigger acute lumenal thrombosis, which may then cause unstable angina, myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, or stroke. Many of these clinically dangerous lesions have hallmarks of defective inflammation resolution, including defective clearance of dead cells (efferocytosis), necrosis, a defective scar response, and decreased levels of lipid mediators of the resolution response. Efferocytosis is both an effector arm of the resolution response and an inducer of resolution mediators, and thus its defect in advanced atherosclerosis amplifies plaque progression. Preclinical causation/treatment studies have demonstrated that replacement therapy with exogenously administered resolving mediators can improve lesional efferocytosis and prevent plaque progression. Work in this area has the potential to potentiate the cardiovascular benefits of apoB-lipoprotein-lowering therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Defective insulin signaling in hepatocytes is a key factor in type 2 diabetes. In obesity, activation of\u00a0calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in hepatocytes suppresses ATF6, which triggers a PERK-ATF4-TRB3 pathway that disrupts insulin signaling. Elucidating how CaMKII suppresses ATF6 is therefore essential to understanding this insulin resistance pathway. We show that CaMKII phosphorylates and blocks nuclear translocation of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4). As a result, HDAC4-mediated SUMOylation of the corepressor DACH1 is decreased, which protects DACH1 from proteasomal degradation. DACH1, together with nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR), represses Atf6 transcription, leading to activation of the PERK-TRB3 pathway and defective insulin signaling. DACH1 is increased in the livers of obese mice and humans, and treatment of obese mice with liver-targeted constitutively nuclear HDAC4 or DACH1 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) increases ATF6, improves hepatocyte insulin signaling, and protects against hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Thus, DACH1-mediated corepression in hepatocytes emerges as an important link between obesity and insulin resistance.",

        "Title": "MerTK cleavage limits proresolving mediator biosynthesis and exacerbates tissue inflammation.",
        "Abstract": "The acute inflammatory response requires a coordinated resolution program to prevent excessive inflammation, repair collateral damage, and restore tissue homeostasis, and failure of this response contributes to the pathology of numerous chronic inflammatory diseases. Resolution is mediated in part by long-chain fatty acid-derived lipid mediators called specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs). However, how SPMs are regulated during the inflammatory response, and how this process goes awry in inflammatory diseases, are poorly understood. We now show that signaling through the Mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK) receptor in cultured macrophages and in sterile inflammation in vivo promotes SPM biosynthesis by a mechanism involving an increase in the cytoplasmic:nuclear ratio of a key SPM biosynthetic enzyme, 5-lipoxygenase. This action of MerTK is linked to the resolution of sterile peritonitis and, after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, to increased circulating SPMs and decreased remote organ inflammation. MerTK is susceptible to ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17)-mediated cell-surface cleavage under inflammatory conditions, but the functional significance is not known. We show here that SPM biosynthesis is increased and inflammation resolution is improved in a new mouse model in which endogenous MerTK was replaced with a genetically engineered variant that is cleavage-resistant (Mertk(CR)). Mertk(CR) mice also have increased circulating levels of SPMs and less lung injury after I/R. Thus, MerTK cleavage during inflammation limits SPM biosynthesis and the resolution response. These findings contribute to our understanding of how SPM synthesis is regulated during the inflammatory response and suggest new therapeutic avenues to boost resolution in settings where defective resolution promotes disease progression.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammation is an essential protective biological response involving a coordinated cascade of signals between cytokines and immune signaling molecules that facilitate return to tissue homeostasis after acute injury or infection. However, inflammation is not effectively resolved in chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and can lead to tissue damage and exacerbation of the underlying condition. Therapeutics that dampen inflammation and enhance resolution are currently of considerable interest, in particular those that temper inflammation with minimal host collateral damage. Here we present the development and efficacy investigations of controlled-release polymeric nanoparticles incorporating the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) for targeted delivery to atherosclerotic plaques. Nanoparticles were nanoengineered via self-assembly of biodegradable polyester polymers by nanoprecipitation using a rapid micromixer chip capable of producing nanoparticles with retained IL-10 bioactivity post-exposure to organic solvent. A systematic combinatorial approach was taken to screen nanoparticles, resulting in an optimal bioactive formulation from in vitro and ex vivo studies. The most potent nanoparticle termed Col-IV IL-10 NP22 significantly tempered acute inflammation in a self-limited peritonitis model and was shown to be more potent than native IL-10. Furthermore, the Col-IV IL-10 nanoparticles prevented vulnerable plaque formation by increasing fibrous cap thickness and decreasing necrotic cores in advanced lesions of high fat-fed LDLr(-/-) mice. These results demonstrate the efficacy and pro-resolving potential of this engineered nanoparticle for controlled delivery of the potent IL-10 cytokine for the treatment of atherosclerosis.",

        "Title": "Macrophage Phenotype and Function in Different Stages of Atherosclerosis.",
        "Abstract": "The remarkable plasticity and plethora of biological functions performed by macrophages have enticed scientists to study these cells in relation to atherosclerosis for >50 years, and major discoveries continue to be made today. It is now understood that macrophages play important roles in all stages of atherosclerosis, from initiation of lesions and lesion expansion, to necrosis leading to rupture and the clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis, to resolution and regression of atherosclerotic lesions. Lesional macrophages are derived primarily from blood monocytes, although recent research has shown that lesional macrophage-like cells can also be derived from smooth muscle cells. Lesional macrophages take on different phenotypes depending on their environment and which intracellular signaling pathways are activated. Rather than a few distinct populations of macrophages, the phenotype of the lesional macrophage is more complex and likely changes during the different phases of atherosclerosis and with the extent of lipid and cholesterol loading, activation by a plethora of receptors, and metabolic state of the cells. These different phenotypes allow the macrophage to engulf lipids, dead cells, and other substances perceived as danger signals; efflux cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein; proliferate and migrate; undergo apoptosis and death; and secrete a large number of inflammatory and proresolving molecules. This review article, part of the Compendium on Atherosclerosis, discusses recent advances in our understanding of lesional macrophage phenotype and function in different stages of atherosclerosis. With the increasing understanding of the roles of lesional macrophages, new research areas and treatment strategies are beginning to emerge.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity-induced inflammation in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a major contributor to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Whereas innate immune cells, notably macrophages, contribute to visceral adipose tissue (VAT) inflammation and insulin resistance, the role of adaptive immunity is less well defined. To address this critical gap, we used a model in which endogenous activation of T cells was suppressed in obese mice by blocking MyD88-mediated maturation of CD11c+ antigen-presenting cells. VAT CD11c+ cells from Cd11cCre+Myd88fl/fl vs. control Myd88fl/fl mice were defective in activating T cells in vitro, and VAT T and B cell activation was markedly reduced in Cd11cCre+Myd88fl/fl obese mice. However, neither macrophage-mediated VAT inflammation nor systemic inflammation were altered in Cd11cCre+Myd88fl/fl mice, thereby enabling a focused analysis on adaptive immunity. Unexpectedly, fasting blood glucose, plasma insulin, and the glucose response to glucose and insulin were completely unaltered in Cd11cCre+Myd88fl/fl vs. control obese mice. Thus, CD11c+ cells activate VAT T and B cells in obese mice, but suppression of this process does not have a discernible effect on macrophage-mediated VAT inflammation or systemic glucose homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of obesity-induced type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing worldwide, and new treatment strategies are needed. We recently discovered that obesity activates a previously unknown pathway that promotes both excessive hepatic glucose production (HGP) and defective insulin signaling in hepatocytes, leading to exacerbation of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in obesity. At the hub of this new pathway is a kinase cascade involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), p38\u03b1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and MAPKAPK2/3 (MK2/3). Genetic-based inhibition of these kinases improves metabolism in obese mice. Here, we report that treatment of obese insulin-resistant mice with an allosteric MK2/3 inhibitor, compound (cmpd) 28, ameliorates glucose homeostasis by suppressing excessive HGP and enhancing insulin signaling. The metabolic improvement seen with cmpd 28 is additive with the leading T2D drug, metformin, but it is not additive with dominant-negative MK2, suggesting an on-target mechanism of action. Allosteric MK2/3 inhibitors represent a potentially new approach to T2D that is highly mechanism based, has links to human T2D, and is predicted to avoid certain adverse effects seen with current T2D drugs.",

Over time, this process stimulates a nonresolving inflammatory response that can cause intimal destruction, arterial thrombosis, and end-organ ischemia. Recent advances highlight important cell biological atherogenic processes, including mechanotransduction and inflammatory processes in endothelial cells, origins and contributions of lesional macrophages, and origins and phenotypic switching of lesional smooth muscle cells. These advances illustrate how in-depth mechanistic knowledge of the cellular pathobiology of atherosclerosis can lead to new ideas for therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic, nonresolving inflammation is a critical factor in the clinical progression of advanced atherosclerotic lesions. In the normal inflammatory response, resolution is mediated by several agonists, among which is the glucocorticoid-regulated protein called annexin A1. The proresolving actions of annexin A1, which are mediated through its receptor N-formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2/ALX), can be mimicked by an amino-terminal peptide encompassing amino acids 2-26 (Ac2-26). Collagen IV (Col IV)-targeted nanoparticles (NPs) containing Ac2-26 were evaluated for their therapeutic effect on chronic, advanced atherosclerosis in fat-fed Ldlr(-/-) mice. When administered to mice with preexisting lesions, Col IV-Ac2-26 NPs were targeted to lesions and led to a marked improvement in key advanced plaque properties, including an increase in the protective collagen layer overlying lesions (which was associated with a decrease in lesional collagenase activity), suppression of oxidative stress, and a decrease in plaque necrosis. In mice lacking FPR2/ALX in myeloid cells, these improvements were not seen. Thus, administration of a resolution-mediating peptide in a targeted NP activates its receptor on myeloid cells to stabilize advanced atherosclerotic lesions. These findings support the concept that defective inflammation resolution plays a role in advanced atherosclerosis, and suggest a new form of therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Imbalances between proinflammatory and proresolving mediators can lead to chronic inflammatory diseases. The balance of arachidonic acid-derived mediators in leukocytes is thought to be achieved through intracellular localization of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX): nuclear 5-LOX favors the biosynthesis of proinflammatory leukotriene B4 (LTB4), whereas, in theory, cytoplasmic 5-LOX could favor the biosynthesis of proresolving lipoxin A4 (LXA4). This balance is shifted in favor of LXA4 by resolvin D1 (RvD1), a specialized proresolving mediator derived from docosahexaenoic acid, but the mechanism is not known. Here we report a new pathway through which RvD1 promotes nuclear exclusion of 5-LOX and thereby suppresses LTB4 and enhances LXA4 in macrophages. RvD1, by activating its receptor formyl peptide receptor2/lipoxin A4 receptor, suppresses cytosolic calcium and decreases activation of the calcium-sensitive kinase calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). CaMKII inhibition suppresses activation P38 and mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 kinases, which reduces Ser271 phosphorylation of 5-LOX and shifts 5-LOX from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. As such, RvD1's ability to decrease nuclear 5-LOX and the LTB4:LXA4 ratio in vitro and in vivo was mimicked by macrophages lacking CaMKII or expressing S271A-5-LOX. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how a specialized proresolving mediator from the docosahexaenoic acid pathway shifts the balance toward resolution in the arachidonic acid pathway. Knowledge of this mechanism may provide new strategies for promoting inflammation resolution in chronic inflammatory diseases.",

Moreover, inflammatory pathways not only regulate the properties of plaques that precipitate acute coronary syndromes but also modulate the clinical consequences of the thrombotic complications of atherosclerosis. This synthesis will provide an update on the fundamental mechanisms of inflammatory responses that govern acute coronary syndromes and also highlight the ongoing balance between proinflammatory mechanisms and endogenous pathways that can promote the resolution of inflammation. An appreciation of the countervailing mechanisms that modulate inflammation in relation to acute coronary syndromes enriches our fundamental understanding of the pathophysiology of this important manifestation of atherosclerosis. In addition, these insights provide glimpses into potential novel therapeutic interventions to forestall this ultimate complication of the disease.",

The best drugs would go beyond minimizing adverse effects and have protective actions against both metabolic disease and CVD. In this perspective, we will outline a few examples in which a deep mechanistic understanding of the many cellular pathways that contribute to type 2 diabetes and CVD, regardless of cell type, have resulted in common upstream pathogenic pathways that can be therapeutically targeted.",

This review aims to summarize the most recent studies showing the existence, the causes and pathological consequences of excessive mtROS in atherosclerosis. Despite numerous association and causation studies demonstrating the importance of mtROS in atherosclerosis progression, the failure of antioxidant therapy in human randomized clinical trials demands more definitive, cell-type specific investigations. Better mechanistic understanding of mtROS in atherosclerosis may lead to more effective therapeutic strategies.",

        "Abstract": "The phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (ACs), or efferocytosis, by DCs is critical for self-tolerance and host defense. Although many efferocytosis-associated receptors have been described in vitro, the functionality of these receptors in vivo has not been explored in depth. Using a spleen efferocytosis assay and targeted genetic deletion in mice, we identified a multiprotein complex--composed of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, LDL receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1), and RAN-binding protein 9 (RANBP9)--that mediates DC efferocytosis and antigen cross-presentation. We found that AXL bound ACs, but required LRP-1 to trigger internalization, in murine CD8\u03b1+ DCs and human-derived DCs. AXL and LRP-1 did not interact directly, but relied on RANBP9, which bound both AXL and LRP-1, to form the complex. In a coculture model of antigen presentation, the AXL/LRP-1/RANBP9 complex was used by DCs to cross-present AC-associated antigens to T cells. Furthermore, in a murine model of herpes simplex virus-1 infection, mice lacking DC-specific LRP-1, AXL, or RANBP9 had increased AC accumulation, defective viral antigen-specific CD8+ T cell activation, enhanced viral load, and decreased survival. The discovery of this multiprotein complex that mediates functionally important DC efferocytosis in vivo may have implications for future studies related to host defense and DC-based vaccines.",

        "Abstract": "A hallmark of obesity is selective suppression of hepatic insulin signaling (\"insulin resistance\"), but critical gaps remain in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms. We now report a major role for hepatic CaMKII, a calcium-responsive kinase that is activated in obesity. Genetic targeting of hepatic CaMKII, its downstream mediator p38, or the p38 substrate and stabilizer MK2 enhances insulin-induced p-Akt in palmitate-treated hepatocytes and obese mouse liver, leading to metabolic improvement. The mechanism of improvement begins with induction of ATF6 and the ATF6 target p58(IPK), a chaperone that suppresses the PERK-p-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 branch of the UPR. The result is a decrease in the ATF4 target TRB3, an inhibitor of insulin-induced p-Akt, leading to enhanced activation of Akt and its\u00a0downstream metabolic mediators. These findings increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms linking obesity to selective insulin resistance and suggest new therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease with activation of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent activators of adaptive immunity and have been identified in the normal arterial wall and within atherosclerotic lesions. Recent evidence points to a functional role for DCs in all stages of atherosclerosis because of their myriad functions including lipid uptake, antigen presentation, efferocytosis, and inflammation resolution. Moreover, DC-based vaccination strategies are currently being developed for the treatment of atherosclerosis. This review will focus on the current evidence as well as the proposed roles for DCs in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and discuss future therapeutic strategies.",

        "Abstract": "Prevention of atherosclerotic vascular disease through systemic risk factor management has had great success, but cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death. One approach to this treatment gap is complementary arterial wall-based therapy that inhibits either the trigger of atherosclerosis, lipoprotein retention, or its pathobiological consequences, non-resolving inflammation. A recent paper by Kastrup et al describes a technical advance that brings this approach closer to reality. The investigators have developed and validated a drug-eluting adhesive biogel that has the durability and stability to provide chronic therapy directly to plaques in the setting of pulsatile arterial blood flow. This advance expands the opportunity to develop drugs that retard atherosclerotic plaque progression and promote plaque resolution and regression.",

        "Title": "The UPR in atherosclerosis.",
        "Abstract": "Multiple systemic factors and local stressors in the arterial wall can disturb the functions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing ER stress in endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and macrophages during the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. As a protective response to restore ER homeostasis, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is initiated by three major ER sensors: protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring protein 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). The activation of the various UPR signaling pathways displays a temporal pattern of activation at different stages of the disease. The ATF6 and IRE1\u03b1 pathways that promote the expression of protein chaperones in ER are activated in ECs in athero-susceptible regions of pre-lesional arteries and before the appearance of foam cells. The PERK pathway that reduces ER protein client load by blocking protein translation is activated in SMCs and macrophages in early lesions. The activation of these UPR signaling pathways aims to cope with the ER stress and plays a pro-survival role in the early stage of atherosclerosis. However, with the progression of atherosclerosis, the extended duration and increased intensity of ER stress in lesions lead to prolonged and enhanced UPR signaling. Under this circumstance, the PERK pathway induces expression of death effectors, and possibly IRE1\u03b1 activates apoptosis signaling pathways, leading to apoptosis of macrophages and SMCs in advanced lesions. Importantly, UPR-mediated cell death is associated with plaque instability and the clinical progression of atherosclerosis. Moreover, UPR signaling is linked to inflammation and possibly to macrophage differentiation in lesions. Therapeutic approaches targeting the UPR may have promise in the prevention and/or regression of atherosclerosis. However, more progress is needed to fully understand all of the roles of the UPR in atherosclerosis and to harness this information for therapeutic advances.",

        "Abstract": "Excessive inflammation and failed resolution of the inflammatory response are underlying components of numerous conditions such as arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Hence, therapeutics that dampen inflammation and enhance resolution are of considerable interest. In this study, we demonstrate the proresolving activity of sub-100-nm nanoparticles (NPs) containing the anti-inflammatory peptide Ac2-26, an annexin A1/lipocortin 1-mimetic peptide. These NPs were engineered using biodegradable diblock poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-polyethyleneglycol and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-polyethyleneglycol collagen IV-targeted polymers. Using a self-limited zymosan-induced peritonitis model, we show that the Ac2-26 NPs (100 ng per mouse) were significantly more potent than Ac2-26 native peptide at limiting recruitment of polymononuclear neutrophils (56% vs. 30%) and at decreasing the resolution interval up to 4 h. Moreover, systemic administration of collagen IV targeted Ac2-26 NPs (in as low as 1 \u00b5g peptide per mouse) was shown to significantly block tissue damage in hind-limb ischemia-reperfusion injury by up to 30% in comparison with controls. Together, these findings demonstrate that Ac2-26 NPs are proresolving in vivo and raise the prospect of their use in chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis.",

        "Abstract": "A number of widespread and devastating chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease, have a pathophysiologically important inflammatory component. In these diseases, the precise identity of the inflammatory stimulus is often unknown and, if known, is difficult to remove. Thus, there is interest in therapeutically targeting the inflammatory response. Although there has been success with anti-inflammatory therapy in chronic diseases triggered by primary inflammation dysregulation or autoimmunity, there are considerable limitations. In particular, the inflammatory response is critical for survival. As a result, redundancy, compensatory pathways, and necessity narrow the risk:benefit ratio of anti-inflammatory drugs. However, new advances in understanding inflammatory signaling and its links to resolution pathways, together with new drug development, offer promise in this area of translational biomedical research.",

        "Abstract": "TLR activation on CD11c+ DCs triggers DC maturation, which is critical for T cell activation. Given the expansion of CD11c+ DCs during the progression of atherosclerosis and the key role of T cell activation in atherogenesis, we sought to understand the role of TLR signaling in CD11c+ DCs in atherosclerosis. To this end, we used a mouse model in which a key TLR adaptor involved in DC maturation, MYD88, is deleted in CD11c+ DCs. We transplanted bone marrow containing Myd88-deficient CD11c+ DCs into Western diet-fed LDL receptor knockout mice and found that the transplanted mice had decreased activation of effector T cells in the periphery as well as decreased infiltration of both effector T cells and Tregs in atherosclerotic lesions. Surprisingly, the net effect was an increase in atherosclerotic lesion size due to an increase in the content of myeloid-derived inflammatory cells. The mechanism involves increased lesional monocyte recruitment associated with loss of Treg-mediated suppression of MCP-1. Thus, the dominant effect of MYD88 signaling in CD11c+ DCs in the setting of atherosclerosis is to promote the development of atheroprotective Tregs. In the absence of MYD88 signaling in CD11c+ DCs, the loss of this protective Treg response trumps the loss of proatherogenic T effector cell activation.",

        "Title": "Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy.",
        "Abstract": "In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field.",

        "Abstract": "Accumulation of toxic lipids evokes the unfolded protein response (UPR) and apoptotic death of macrophages and vascular cells in atherosclerotic plaques. Primary macrophages from insulin-resistant ob/ob and insulin receptor (Insr)(-/-) mice display increased apoptosis in response to loading with free cholesterol or oxysterol, but underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. We show increased activation of all three major branches of the UPR in response to free cholesterol or oxysterol loading in insulin-resistant macrophages. Inhibition and rescue experiments revealed that defective MEK/extracellular signal\\x{2013}related kinase (ERK)/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREBP) signaling in insulin-resistant macrophages leads to decreased expression of sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+)-ATPase, depletion of ER calcium stores, PKR-like ER kinase activation, and ER stress-associated apoptosis. Activation of macrophage glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor via the antidiabetic drug exenatide led to improvements in both ERK and AKT signaling and reversed the increase in UPR and apoptosis of insulin-resistant macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions of ob/ob.Ldlr(-/-) and Insr(-/-).Ldlr(-/-) mice. Increased signaling via GLP-1 receptor or the CREBP activator protein kinase A thus offers a way to rescue insulin-resistant macrophages from excessive ER stress responses and apoptosis in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "Signaling through MyD88, an adaptor utilized by all TLRs except TLR3, is pro-atherogenic; however, it is unknown whether signaling through TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF), an adaptor used only by TLRs 3 and 4, is relevant to atherosclerosis. We determined that the TRIF(Lps2) lack-of-function mutation was atheroprotective in hyperlipidemic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor knockout (LDLr(-/-)) mice. LDLr(-/-) mice were crossed with either TRIF(Lps2) or TLR3 knockout mice. After feeding an atherogenic diet for 10-15 wks, atherosclerotic lesions in the heart sinus and aorta were quantitated. LDLr(-/-) mice with TRIF(Lps2) were significantly protected from atherosclerosis. TRIF(Lps2) led to a reduction in cytokines secreted from peritoneal macrophages (M) in response to hyperlipidemia. Moreover, heart sinus valves from hyperlipidemic LDLr(-/-) TRIF(Lps2) mice had significantly fewer lesional M. However, LDLr(-/-) mice deficient in TLR3 showed some enhancement of disease. Collectively, these data suggest that hyperlipidemia resulting in endogenous activation of the TRIF signaling pathway from TLR4 leads to pro-atherogenic events.",

        "Title": "Calcium signaling through CaMKII regulates hepatic glucose production in fasting and obesity.",
        "Abstract": "Hepatic glucose production (HGP) is crucial for glucose homeostasis, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that a calcium-sensing enzyme, CaMKII, is activated in a calcium- and IP3R-dependent manner by cAMP and glucagon in primary hepatocytes and by glucagon and fasting in vivo. Genetic deficiency or inhibition of CaMKII blocks nuclear translocation of FoxO1 by affecting its phosphorylation, impairs fasting- and glucagon/cAMP-induced glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and lowers blood glucose levels, while constitutively active CaMKII has the opposite effects. Importantly, the suppressive effect of CaMKII deficiency on glucose metabolism is abrogated by transduction with constitutively nuclear FoxO1, indicating that the effect of CaMKII deficiency requires nuclear exclusion of FoxO1. This same pathway is also involved in excessive HGP in the setting of obesity. These results reveal a calcium-mediated signaling pathway involved in FoxO1 nuclear localization and hepatic glucose homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "In the fasted state, increases in circulating glucagon promote hepatic glucose production through induction of the gluconeogenic program. Triggering of the cyclic AMP pathway increases gluconeogenic gene expression via the de-phosphorylation of the CREB co-activator CRTC2 (ref. 1). Glucagon promotes CRTC2 dephosphorylation in part through the protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated inhibition of the CRTC2 kinase SIK2. A number of Ser/Thr phosphatases seem to be capable of dephosphorylating CRTC2 (refs 2, 3), but the mechanisms by which hormonal cues regulate these enzymes remain unclear. Here we show in mice that glucagon stimulates CRTC2 dephosphorylation in hepatocytes by mobilizing intracellular calcium stores and activating the calcium/calmodulin-dependent Ser/Thr-phosphatase calcineurin (also known as PP3CA). Glucagon increased cytosolic calcium concentration through the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP(3)Rs), which associate with CRTC2. After their activation, InsP(3)Rs enhanced gluconeogenic gene expression by promoting the calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of CRTC2. During feeding, increases in insulin signalling reduced CRTC2 activity via the AKT-mediated inactivation of InsP(3)Rs. InsP(3)R activity was increased in diabetes, leading to upregulation of the gluconeogenic program. As hepatic downregulation of InsP(3)Rs and calcineurin improved circulating glucose levels in insulin resistance, these results demonstrate how interactions between cAMP and calcium pathways at the level of the InsP(3)R modulate hepatic glucose production under fasting conditions and in diabetes.",

        "Title": "Activation of ER stress and mTORC1 suppresses hepatic sortilin-1 levels in obese mice.",
        "Abstract": "Recent GWAS have identified SNPs at a human chromosom1 locus associated with coronary artery disease risk and LDL cholesterol levels. The SNPs are also associated with altered expression of hepatic sortilin-1 (SORT1), which encodes a protein thought to be involved in apoB trafficking and degradation. Here, we investigated the regulation of Sort1 expression in mouse models of obesity. Sort1 expression was markedly repressed in both genetic (ob/ob) and high-fat diet models of obesity; restoration of hepatic sortilin-1 levels resulted in reduced triglyceride and apoB secretion. Mouse models of obesity also exhibit increased hepatic activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and ER stress, and we found that administration of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to ob/ob mice reduced ER stress and increased hepatic sortilin-1 levels. Conversely, genetically increased hepatic mTORC1 activity was associated with repressed Sort1 and increased apoB secretion. Treating WT mice with the ER stressor tunicamycin led to marked repression of hepatic sortilin-1 expression, while administration of the chemical chaperone PBA to ob/ob mice led to amelioration of ER stress, increased sortilin-1 expression, and reduced apoB and triglyceride secretion. Moreover, the ER stress target Atf3 acted at the SORT1 promoter region as a transcriptional repressor, whereas knockdown of Atf3 mRNA in ob/ob mice led to increased hepatic sortilin-1 levels and decreased apoB and triglyceride secretion. Thus, in mouse models of obesity, induction of mTORC1 and ER stress led to repression of hepatic Sort1 and increased VLDL secretion via Atf3. This pathway may contribute to dyslipidemia in metabolic disease.",

        "Abstract": "In advanced atherosclerosis, macrophage apoptosis coupled with defective phagocytic clearance of the apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) promotes plaque necrosis, which precipitates acute atherothrombotic cardiovascular events. Oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in macrophages are important causes of advanced lesional macrophage apoptosis. We now show that proapoptotic oxidative/ER stress inducers trigger another stress reaction in macrophages, autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy by silencing ATG5 or other autophagy mediators enhances apoptosis and NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative stress while at the same time rendering the apoptotic cells less well recognized by efferocytes. Most importantly, macrophage ATG5 deficiency in fat-fed Ldlr(-/-) mice increases apoptosis and oxidative stress in advanced lesional macrophages, promotes plaque necrosis, and worsens lesional efferocytosis. These findings reveal a protective process in oxidatively stressed macrophages\u00a0relevant to plaque necrosis, suggesting\u00a0a mechanism-based strategy to therapeutically suppress atherosclerosis progression and its clinical sequelae.",

        "Abstract": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in insulin-resistant (type 2) diabetes. Vascular endothelial dysfunction paves the way for atherosclerosis through impaired nitric oxide availability, inflammation, and generation of superoxide. Surprisingly, we show that ablation of the three genes encoding isoforms of transcription factor FoxO in endothelial cells prevents atherosclerosis in low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice by reversing these subphenotypes. Paradoxically, the atheroprotective effect of FoxO deletion is associated with a marked decrease of insulin-dependent Akt phosphorylation in endothelial cells, owing to reduced FoxO-dependent expression of the insulin receptor adaptor proteins Irs1 and Irs2. These findings support a model in which FoxO is the shared effector of multiple atherogenic pathways in endothelial cells. FoxO ablation lowers the threshold of Akt activity required for protection from atherosclerosis. The data demonstrate that FoxO inhibition in endothelial cells has the potential to mediate wide-ranging therapeutic benefits for diabetes-associated cardiovascular disease.",

        "Abstract": "Activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) induces the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPR) to accommodate essential protein translation. However, despite increased levels of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1), a TLR-TRIF-dependent pathway assures that the cells avoid CHOP induction, apoptosis and translational suppression of critical proteins. As p-eIF2\u03b1 decreases the functional interaction of eIF2 with eIF2B, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), we explored the hypothesis that TLR-TRIF signalling activates eIF2B GEF activity to counteract the effects of p-eIF2\u03b1. We now show that TLR-TRIF signalling activates eIF2B GEF through PP2A-mediated serine dephosphorylation of the eIF2B \u025b-subunit. PP2A itself is activated by decreased Src-family-kinase-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of its catalytic subunit. Each of these processes is required for TLR-TRIF-mediated CHOP suppression in ER-stressed cells in vitro and in vivo. Thus, in the setting of prolonged, physiologic ER stress, a unique TLR-TRIF-dependent translational control pathway enables cells to carry out essential protein synthesis and avoid CHOP-induced apoptosis while still benefiting from the protective arms of the UPR.",

        "Abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is triggered by perturbations in ER function such as those caused by protein misfolding or by increases in protein secretion. Eukaryotic cells respond to ER stress by activating 3 ER-resident proteins, activating transcription factor-6, inositol requiring protein-1, and protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK). These proteins direct signaling pathways that relieve ER stress in a process known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). In pathological settings, however, prolonged UPR activation can promote cell death, and this process has recently emerged as an important concept in atherosclerosis. We review here the evidence for UPR activation and cell death in macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells in the context of advanced atherosclerosis as well as the existing literature regarding mechanisms of UPR-induced cell death. Knowledge in this area may suggest new therapeutic targets relevant to the formation of clinically dangerous atherosclerotic plaques.",

Both macrophages and DC-like efferocytes are juxtaposed near expanding necrotic cores, where they engage apoptotic cells.

        "Title": "Shedding of the Mer tyrosine kinase receptor is mediated by ADAM17 protein through a pathway involving reactive oxygen species, protein kinase C\u03b4, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).",
        "Abstract": "Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) is an integral membrane protein that is preferentially expressed by phagocytic cells, where it promotes efferocytosis and inhibits inflammatory signaling. Proteolytic cleavage of MerTK at an unidentified site leads to shedding of its soluble ectodomain (soluble MER; sMER), which can inhibit thrombosis in mice and efferocytosis in vitro. Herein, we show that MerTK is cleaved at proline 485 in murine macrophages. Site-directed deletion of 6 amino acids spanning proline 485 rendered MerTK resistant to proteolysis and suppression of efferocytosis by cleavage-inducing stimuli. LPS is a known inducer of MerTK cleavage, and the intracellular signaling pathways required for this action are unknown. LPS/TLR4-mediated generation of sMER required disintegrin and metalloproteinase ADAM17 and was independent of Myd88, instead requiring TRIF adaptor signaling. LPS-induced cleavage was suppressed by deficiency of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) and PKC\u03b4. The addition of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine inhibited PKC\u03b4, and silencing of PKC\u03b4 inhibited MAPK p38, which was also required. In a mouse model of endotoxemia, we discovered that LPS induced plasma sMER, and this was suppressed by Adam17 deficiency. Thus, a TRIF-mediated pattern recognition receptor signaling cascade requires NADPH oxidase to activate PKC\u03b4 and then p38, culminating in ADAM17-mediated proteolysis of MerTK. These findings link innate pattern recognition receptor signaling to proteolytic inactivation of MerTK and generation of sMER and uncover targets to test how MerTK cleavage affects efferocytosis efficiency and inflammation resolution in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "The lipid droplet (LD) is the major site of cholesterol storage in macrophage foam cells and is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of atherosclerosis. Cholesterol, stored as cholesteryl esters (CEs), is liberated from this organelle and delivered to cholesterol acceptors. The current paradigm attributes all cytoplasmic CE hydrolysis to the action of neutral CE hydrolases. Here, we demonstrate an important role for lysosomes in LD CE hydrolysis in cholesterol-loaded macrophages, in addition to that mediated by neutral hydrolases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LDs are delivered to lysosomes via autophagy, where lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) acts to hydrolyze LD CE to generate free cholesterol mainly for ABCA1-dependent efflux; this process is specifically induced upon macrophage cholesterol loading. We conclude that, in macrophage foam cells, lysosomal hydrolysis contributes to the mobilization of LD-associated cholesterol for reverse cholesterol transport.",

Macrophages derived from these recruited monocytes participate in a maladaptive, nonresolving inflammatory response that expands the subendothelial layer due to the accumulation of cells, lipid, and matrix. Some lesions subsequently form a necrotic core, triggering acute thrombotic vascular disease, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden cardiac death.

        "Abstract": "Progression of human arteriosclerosis is associated with and promoted by induction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Most studies that assess UPR markers in atherosclerosis rely on methodologies that suffer from low signal sensitivity, nonspecific immunohistochemistry, or inability to resolve differences between cellular subsets. To accurately monitor the UPR independently of artifacts generated postmortem, we describe here the first in vivo reporter for ER stress during atherosclerosis. Mice transgenic for the fluorescent XBP-1 ER stress indicator Erai were bred onto the Ldlr(-/-) background and fed an atherogenic diet. Subsequently, ERAI fluorescence at aortic roots was quantified and colocalized with lesional cell type. We found that the ERAI fluorescent signal increased as a function of time on the atherogenic diet and, in advanced lesions, was found close to necrotic cores. The majority of ERAI fluorescence localized to macrophages, and to a lesser extent, to intimal smooth muscle cells and patches of endothelial cells. These mice provide a valuable tool to monitor activation of the UPR in atherosclerosis and will be useful for future studies investigating relationships between pharmacologic and genetic modulators of UPR and atherosclerosis.",

        "Title": "Loss of subcellular lipid transport due to ARV1 deficiency disrupts organelle homeostasis and activates the unfolded protein response.",
        "Abstract": "The ARV1-encoded protein mediates sterol transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane. Yeast ARV1 mutants accumulate multiple lipids in the ER and are sensitive to pharmacological modulators of both sterol and sphingolipid metabolism. Using fluorescent and electron microscopy, we demonstrate sterol accumulation, subcellular membrane expansion, elevated lipid droplet formation, and vacuolar fragmentation in ARV1 mutants. Motif-based regression analysis of ARV1 deletion transcription profiles indicates activation of Hac1p, an integral component of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Accordingly, we show constitutive splicing of HAC1 transcripts, induction of a UPR reporter, and elevated expression of UPR targets in ARV1 mutants. IRE1, encoding the unfolded protein sensor in the ER lumen, exhibits a lethal genetic interaction with ARV1, indicating a viability requirement for the UPR in cells lacking ARV1. Surprisingly, ARV1 mutants expressing a variant of Ire1p defective in sensing unfolded proteins are viable. Moreover, these strains also exhibit constitutive HAC1 splicing that interacts with DTT-mediated perturbation of protein folding. These data suggest that a component of UPR induction in arv1\u0394 strains is distinct from protein misfolding. Decreased ARV1 expression in murine macrophages also results in UPR induction, particularly up-regulation of activating transcription factor-4, CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), and apoptosis. Cholesterol loading or inhibition of cholesterol esterification further elevated CHOP expression in ARV1 knockdown cells. Thus, loss or down-regulation of ARV1 disturbs membrane and lipid homeostasis, resulting in a disruption of ER integrity, one consequence of which is induction of the UPR.",

        "Abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress contribute to several chronic disease processes, yet molecular and cellular mechanisms linking ER stress and oxidative stress in the setting of apoptosis are poorly understood and infrequently explored in vivo. In this paper, we focus on a previously elucidated ER stress-apoptosis pathway whose molecular components have been identified and documented to cause apoptosis in vivo. We now show that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced oxidase (NOX) and NOX-mediated oxidative stress are induced by this pathway and that apoptosis is blocked by both genetic deletion of the NOX subunit NOX2 and by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Unexpectedly, NOX and oxidative stress further amplify CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) induction through activation of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). In vivo, NOX2 deficiency protects ER-stressed mice from renal cell CHOP induction and apoptosis and prevents renal dysfunction. These data provide new insight into how ER stress, oxidative stress, and PKR activation can be integrated to induce apoptosis in a pathophysiologically relevant manner.",

        "Abstract": "Macrophage apoptosis in advanced atheromata, a key process in plaque necrosis, involves the combination of ER stress with other proapoptotic stimuli. We show here that oxidized phospholipids, oxidized LDL, saturated fatty acids (SFAs), and lipoprotein(a) trigger apoptosis in ER-stressed macrophages through a mechanism requiring both CD36 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). In vivo, macrophage apoptosis was induced in SFA-fed, ER-stressed wild-type but not Cd36\u207b(/)\u207b or Tlr2\u207b(/)\u207b mice. For atherosclerosis, we combined TLR2 deficiency with that of TLR4, which can also promote apoptosis in ER-stressed macrophages. Advanced lesions of fat-fed Ldlr\u207b(/)\u207b mice transplanted with Tlr4\u207b(/)\u207bTlr2\u207b(/)\u207b bone marrow were markedly protected from macrophage apoptosis and plaque necrosis compared with WT \u2192Ldlr\u207b(/)\u207b lesions. These findings provide insight into how atherogenic lipoproteins trigger macrophage apoptosis in the setting of ER stress and how TLR activation might promote macrophage apoptosis and plaque necrosis in advanced atherosclerosis.",

        "Abstract": "Prolonged activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) can lead to cell pathology and subsequent tissue dysfunction. There is now ample evidence that the UPR is chronically activated in atherosclerotic lesional cells, particularly advanced lesional macrophages and endothelial cells. The stressors in advanced lesions that can lead to prolonged activation of the UPR include oxidative stress, oxysterols, and high levels of intracellular cholesterol and saturated fatty acids. Importantly, these arterial wall stressors may be especially prominent in the settings of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes, all of which promote the clinical progression of atherosclerosis. In the case of macrophages, prolonged ER stress triggers apoptosis, which in turn leads to plaque necrosis if the apoptotic cells are not rapidly cleared. ER stress-induced endothelial cell apoptosis may also contribute to plaque progression. Another potentially important proatherogenic effect of prolonged ER stress is activation of inflammatory pathways in macrophages and, perhaps in response to atheroprone shear stress, endothelial cells. Although exciting work over the last decade has begun to shed light on the mechanisms and in vivo relevance of ER stress-driven atherosclerosis, much more work is needed to fully understand this area and to enable an informed approach to therapeutic translation.",

        "Abstract": "Rapid plasma membrane resealing is essential for cellular survival. Earlier studies showed that plasma membrane repair requires Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of lysosomes and a rapid form of endocytosis that removes membrane lesions. However, the functional relationship between lysosomal exocytosis and the rapid endocytosis that follows membrane injury is unknown. In this study, we show that the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is released extracellularly when cells are wounded in the presence of Ca(2+). ASM-deficient cells, including human cells from Niemann-Pick type A (NPA) patients, undergo lysosomal exocytosis after wounding but are defective in injury-dependent endocytosis and plasma membrane repair. Exogenously added recombinant human ASM restores endocytosis and resealing in ASM-depleted cells, suggesting that conversion of plasma membrane sphingomyelin to ceramide by this lysosomal enzyme promotes lesion internalization. These findings reveal a molecular mechanism for restoration of plasma membrane integrity through exocytosis of lysosomes and identify defective plasma membrane repair as a possible component of the severe pathology observed in NPA patients.",

        "Title": "Efficient phagocytosis requires triacylglycerol hydrolysis by adipose triglyceride lipase.",
        "Abstract": "Macrophage phagocytosis is an essential biological process in host defense and requires large amounts of energy. To date, glucose is believed to represent the prime substrate for ATP production in macrophages. To investigate the relative contribution of free fatty acids (FFAs) in this process, we determined the phagocytosis rates in normal mouse macrophages and macrophages of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL)-deficient mice. ATGL was shown to be the rate-limiting enzyme for the hydrolysis of lipid droplet-associated triacylglycerol (TG) in many tissues. Here, we demonstrate that Atgl(-/-) macrophages fail to efficiently hydrolyze cellular TG stores leading to decreased cellular FFA concentrations and concomitant accumulation of lipid droplets, even in the absence of exogenous lipid loading. The reduced availability of FFAs results in decreased cellular ATP concentrations and impaired phagocytosis suggesting that fatty acids must first go through a cycle of esterification and re-hydrolysis before they are available as energy substrate. Exogenously added glucose cannot fully compensate for the phagocytotic defect in Atgl(-/-) macrophages. Hence, phagocytosis was also decreased in vivo when Atgl(-/-) mice were challenged with bacterial particles. These findings imply that phagocytosis in macrophages depends on the availability of FFAs and that ATGL is required for their hydrolytic release from cellular TG stores. This novel mechanism links ATGL-mediated lipolysis to macrophage function in host defense and opens the way to explore possible roles of ATGL in immune response, inflammation, and atherosclerosis.",

        "Abstract": "Different primary lysosomal trafficking defects lead to common alterations in lipid trafficking, suggesting cooperative interactions among lysosomal lipids. However, cellular analysis of the functional consequences of this phenomenon is lacking. As a test case, we studied cells with defective Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein, a cholesterol trafficking protein whose defect gives rise to lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids, leading to NPC disease. NPC1 cells also develop a secondary defect in acid sphingomyelinase (SMase) activity despite a normal acid SMase gene (SMPD1). When acid SMase activity was restored to normal levels in NPC1-deficient CHO cells through SMPD1 transfection, there was a dramatic reduction in lysosomal cholesterol. Two other defects, excess lysosomal bis-(monoacylglycerol) phosphate (BMP) and defective transferrin receptor (TfR) recycling, were also markedly improved. To test its relevance in human cells, the acid SMase activity defect in fibroblasts from NPC1 patients was corrected by SMPD1 transfection or acid SMase enzyme replacement. Both treatments resulted in a dramatic reduction in lysosomal cholesterol. These data show that correcting one aspect of a complex lysosomal lipid storage disease can reduce the cellular consequences even if the primary genetic defect is not corrected.",

        "Abstract": "Atherothrombotic vascular disease is the major cause of death and disability in obese and diabetic subjects with insulin resistance. Although increased systemic risk factors in the setting of insulin resistance contribute to this problem, it is likely exacerbated by direct effects of insulin resistance on the arterial wall cells that participate in atherosclerosis. A critical process in the progression of subclinical atherosclerotic lesions to clinically relevant lesions is necrotic breakdown of plaques. Plaque necrosis, which is particularly prominent in the lesions of diabetics, is caused by the combination of macrophage apoptosis and defective phagocytic clearance, or efferocytosis, of the apoptotic macrophages. One cause of macrophage apoptosis in advanced plaques is activation of a proapoptotic branch of the unfolded protein response, which is an endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. Macrophages have a functional insulin receptor signaling pathway, and downregulation of this pathway in the setting insulin resistance enhances unfolded protein response-induced apoptosis. Moreover, other aspects of the obesity/insulin-resistance syndrome may adversely affect efferocytosis. These processes may therefore provide an important mechanistic link among insulin resistance, plaque necrosis, and atherothrombotic vascular disease and suggest novel therapeutic approaches to this expanding health problem.",

        "Abstract": "A key event in atherosclerosis is a maladaptive inflammatory response to subendothelial lipoproteins. A crucial aspect of this response is a failure to resolve inflammation, which normally involves the suppression of inflammatory cell influx, effective clearance of apoptotic cells and promotion of inflammatory cell egress. Defects in these processes promote the progression of atherosclerotic lesions into dangerous plaques, which can trigger atherothrombotic vascular disease, the leading cause of death in industrialized societies. In this Review I provide an overview of these concepts, with a focus on macrophage death and defective apoptotic cell clearance, and discuss new therapeutic strategies designed to boost inflammation resolution in atherosclerosis.",

        "Abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPR) restores equilibrium to the ER, but prolonged expression of the UPR effector CHOP (GADD153) is cytotoxic. We found that CHOP expression induced by ER stress was suppressed by prior engagement of toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 or 4 through a TRIF-dependent pathway. TLR engagement did not suppress phosphorylation of PERK or eIF-2alpha, which are upstream of CHOP, but phospho-eIF-2alpha failed to promote translation of the CHOP activator ATF4. In mice subjected to systemic ER stress, pretreatment with low dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR4 ligand, suppressed CHOP expression and apoptosis in splenic macrophages, renal tubule cells and hepatocytes, and prevented renal dysfunction and hepatosteatosis. This protective effect of LPS did not occur in Trif(-/-) mice or in wild-type mice in which CHOP expression was genetically restored. Thus, TRIF-mediated signals from TLRs selectively attenuate translational activation of ATF4 and its downstream target gene CHOP. We speculate that this mechanism evolved to promote survival of TLR-expressing cells that experience prolonged levels of physiological ER stress in the course of the host response to invading pathogens.",

        "Abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis is involved in many diseases, but the mechanisms linking ER stress to apoptosis are incompletely understood. Based on roles for C/EPB homologous protein (CHOP) and ER calcium release in apoptosis, we hypothesized that apoptosis involves the activation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R) via CHOP-induced ERO1-alpha (ER oxidase 1 alpha). In ER-stressed cells, ERO1-alpha is induced by CHOP, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of ERO1-alpha suppresses apoptosis. IP3-induced calcium release (IICR) is increased during ER stress, and this response is blocked by siRNA-mediated silencing of ERO1-alpha or IP3R1 and by loss-of-function mutations in Ero1a or Chop. Reconstitution of ERO1-alpha in Chop(-/-) macrophages restores ER stress-induced IICR and apoptosis. In vivo, macrophages from wild-type mice but not Chop(-/-) mice have elevated IICR when the animals are challenged with the ER stressor tunicamycin. Macrophages from insulin-resistant ob/ob mice, another model of ER stress, also have elevated IICR. These data shed new light on how the CHOP pathway of apoptosis triggers calcium-dependent apoptosis through an ERO1-alpha-IP3R pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Plaque necrosis in advanced atheromata, which triggers acute atherothrombotic vascular events, is caused by the apoptosis of lesional macrophages coupled with defective phagocytic clearance of the dead cells. The central enabling event in macrophage apoptosis relevant to advanced atherosclerosis is the unfolded protein response (UPR), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway. The UPR effector CHOP (GADD153) amplifies release of ER Ca(2+) stores, which activates a central integrator of apoptosis signaling, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). CaMKII, in turn, leads to activation of pro-apoptotic STAT1, induction of the death receptor Fas, and stimulation of the mitochondria-cytochrome c pathway of apoptosis. While these pathways are necessary for apoptosis, apoptosis occurs only when the cells are also exposed to one or more additional \"hits.\" These hits amplify pro-apoptotic pathways and/or suppress compensatory cell-survival pathways. A second hit relevant to atherosclerosis is activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as scavenger and toll-like receptors. In vivo relevance is suggested by the fact that advanced human lesions express markers of UPR activation that correlate closely with the degree of plaque vulnerability and macrophage apoptosis. Moreover, studies with genetically altered mice have shown that ER stress and PRR activation are causative for advanced lesional macrophage apoptosis and plaque necrosis. In summary, a key cellular event in the conversion of benign to vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques is ER stress-induced macrophage apoptosis. Further understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of this event may lead to novel therapies directed at preventing the clinical progression of atheromata.",

        "Abstract": "ER stress-induced apoptosis is implicated in various pathological conditions, but the mechanisms linking ER stress-mediated signaling to downstream apoptotic pathways remain unclear. Using human and mouse cell culture and in vivo mouse models of ER stress-induced apoptosis, we have shown that cytosolic calcium resulting from ER stress induces expression of the Fas death receptor through a pathway involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIgamma (CaMKIIgamma) and JNK. Remarkably, CaMKIIgamma was also responsible for processes involved in mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, including release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. CaMKII-dependent apoptosis was also observed in a number of cultured human and mouse cells relevant to ER stress-induced pathology, including cultured macrophages, endothelial cells, and neuronal cells subjected to proapoptotic ER stress. Moreover, WT mice subjected to systemic ER stress showed evidence of macrophage mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, renal epithelial cell apoptosis, and renal dysfunction, and these effects were markedly reduced in CaMKIIgamma-deficient mice. These data support an integrated model in which CaMKII serves as a unifying link between ER stress and the Fas and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. Our study also revealed what we believe to be a novel proapoptotic function for CaMKII, namely, promotion of mitochondrial calcium uptake. These findings raise the possibility that CaMKII inhibitors could be useful in preventing apoptosis in pathological settings involving ER stress-induced apoptosis.",

        "Abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a hallmark of advanced atherosclerosis, but its causative role in plaque progression is unknown. In vitro studies have implicated the ER stress effector CHOP in macrophage apoptosis, a process involved in plaque necrosis in advanced atheromata. To test the effect of CHOP deficiency in vivo, aortic root lesions of fat-fed Chop+/+;Apoe-/- and Chop-/-;Apoe-/- mice were analyzed for size and morphology. Despite similar plasma lipoproteins, lesion area was 35% smaller in Chop-/-;Apoe-/- mice. Most importantly, plaque necrosis was reduced by approximately 50% and lesional apoptosis by 35% in the CHOP-deficient mice. Similar results were found in fat-fed Chop-/-;Ldlr-/- versus Chop+/+;Ldlr-/- mice. Thus, CHOP promotes plaque growth, apoptosis, and plaque necrosis in fat-fed Apoe-/- and Ldlr-/- mice. These data provide direct evidence for a causal link between the ER stress effector CHOP and plaque necrosis and suggest that interventions weakening this arm of the UPR may lessen plaque progression.",

        "Title": "Mechanisms and consequences of efferocytosis in advanced atherosclerosis.",
        "Abstract": "Throughout atherosclerotic lesion development, intimal macrophages undergo apoptosis, a form of death that usually prevents cellular necrosis. In advanced atherosclerotic lesions, however, these apoptotic macrophages become secondarily necrotic and coalesce over time into a key feature of vulnerable plaques, the necrotic core. This event is critically important, as necrotic core formation in these advanced atheromata is thought to promote plaque disruption and ultimately, acute atherothrombotic vascular disease. Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanism behind postapoptotic macrophage necrosis in advanced atherosclerosis is defective phagocytic clearance or \"efferocytosis\" of the apoptotic cells. Thus, understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of efferocytosis in atherosclerosis and why efferocytosis becomes defective in advanced lesions is an important goal. Molecular-genetic causation studies in mouse models of advanced atherosclerosis have provided evidence that several molecules known to be involved in efferocytosis, including TG2, MFG-E8, complement C1q, Mertk, lysoPC, and Fas, play important roles in the clearance of apoptotic cells in advanced plaques. These and future insights into the molecular mechanisms of defective efferocytosis in advanced atheromata may open the way for novel therapeutic strategies for atherothrombotic vascular disease, the leading cause of death in the industrialized world.",

        "Abstract": "ER stress occurs in macrophage-rich areas of advanced atherosclerotic lesions and contributes to macrophage apoptosis and subsequent plaque necrosis. Therefore, signaling pathways that alter ER stress-induced apoptosis may affect advanced atherosclerosis. Here we placed Apoe-/- mice deficient in macrophage p38alpha MAPK on a Western diet and found that they had a marked increase in macrophage apoptosis and plaque necrosis. The macrophage p38alpha-deficient lesions also exhibited a significant reduction in collagen content and a marked thinning of the fibrous cap, which suggests that plaque progression was advanced in these mice. Consistent with our in vivo data, we found that ER stress-induced apoptosis in cultured primary mouse macrophages was markedly accelerated under conditions of p38 inhibition. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of p38 suppressed activation of Akt in cultured macrophages and in atherosclerotic lesions. In addition, inhibition of Akt enhanced ER stress-induced macrophage apoptosis, and expression of a constitutively active myristoylated Akt blocked the enhancement of ER stress-induced apoptosis that occurred with p38 inhibition in cultured cells. Our results demonstrate that p38alpha MAPK may play a critical role in suppressing ER stress-induced macrophage apoptosis in vitro and advanced lesional macrophage apoptosis in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Atherothrombotic vascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, are the leading causes of death in the industrialized world. The immediate cause of these diseases is acute occlusive thrombosis in medium-sized arteries feeding critical organs. Thrombosis is triggered by the rupture or erosion of a minority of atherosclerotic plaques that have advanced to a particular stage of \"vulnerability.\" Vulnerable plaques are characterized by certain key features, such as inflammation, thinning of a protective collagenous cap, and a lipid-rich necrotic core consisting of macrophage debris. A number of cellular events contribute to vulnerable plaque formation, including secretion of pro-inflammatory, procoagulant, and proteolytic molecules by macrophages as well as the death of macrophages, intimal smooth muscles cells, and possibly endothelial cells. The necrotic core in particular is a key factor in plaque vulnerability, because macrophage debris promotes inflammation, plaque instability, and thrombosis. Plaque necrosis arises from a combination of lesional macrophage apoptosis and defective clearance of these dead cells, a process called efferocytosis. This review focuses on how macrophage apoptosis, in the setting of defective efferocytosis, contributes to necrotic core formation and how a process known to be prominent in advanced lesions--activation of ER stress signal-transduction pathways--contributes to macrophage apoptosis in these plaques.",

        "Abstract": "The molecular events linking lipid accumulation in atherosclerotic plaques to complications such as aneurysm formation and plaque disruption are poorly understood. BALB/c-Apoe(-/-) mice bearing a null mutation in the Npc1 gene display prominent medial erosion and atherothrombosis, whereas their macrophages accumulate free cholesterol in late endosomes and show increased cathepsin K (Ctsk) expression. We now show increased cathepsin K immunostaining and increased cysteinyl proteinase activity using near infrared fluorescence imaging over proximal aortas of Apoe(-/-), Npc1(-/-) mice. In mechanistic studies, cholesterol loading of macrophage plasma membranes (cyclodextrin-cholesterol) or endosomal system (AcLDL+U18666A or Npc1 null mutation) activated Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, leading to sustained phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and induction of p38 targets, including Ctsk, S100a8, Mmp8, and Mmp14. Studies in macrophages from knockout mice showed major roles for TLR4, following plasma membrane cholesterol loading, and for TLR3, after late endosomal loading. TLR signaling via p38 led to phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor Microphthalmia transcription factor, acting at E-box elements in the Ctsk promoter. These studies suggest that free cholesterol enrichment of either plasma or endosomal membranes in macrophages leads to activation of signaling via various TLRs, prolonged p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and induction of Mmps, Ctsk, and S100a8, potentially contributing to plaque complications.",

Research directed at understanding the functional consequences of macrophage death in atherosclerosis has revealed opposing roles for apoptosis in atherosclerotic plaque progression. In early lesions, macrophage apoptosis limits lesion cellularity and suppresses plaque progression. In advanced lesions, macrophages apoptosis promotes the development of the necrotic core, a key factor in rendering plaques vulnerable to disruption and in acute lumenal thrombosis. The first section of this review will examine the role of phagocytic clearance of apoptotic macrophages, a process known as efferocytosis, in the dichotomous roles of macrophage apoptosis in early vs. advanced lesions. The second section will focus on the molecular and cellular mechanisms that are thought to govern macrophage death during atherosclerosis. Of particular interest is the complex and coordinated role that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) may play in triggering macrophage apoptosis.",

        "Abstract": "Macrophages play key roles in obesity-associated pathophysiology, including inflammation, atherosclerosis, and cancer, and processes that affect the survival-death balance of macrophages may have an important impact on obesity-related diseases. Adipocytes and other cells secrete a protein called extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNampt; also known as pre-B cell colony enhancing factor or visfatin), and plasma levels of eNampt increase in obesity. Herein we tested the hypothesis that eNampt could promote cell survival in macrophages subjected to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a process associated with obesity and obesity-associated diseases. We show that eNampt potently blocks macrophage apoptosis induced by a number of ER stressors. The mechanism involves a two-step sequential process: rapid induction of interleukin 6 (IL-6) secretion, followed by IL-6-mediated autocrine/paracrine activation of the prosurvival signal transducer STAT3. The ability of eNampt to trigger this IL-6/STAT3 cell survival pathway did not depend on the presence of the Nampt enzymatic substrate nicotinamide in the medium, could not be mimicked by the Nampt enzymatic product nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), was not blocked by the Nampt enzyme inhibitor FK866, and showed no correlation with enzyme activity in a series of site-directed mutant Nampt proteins. Thus, eNampt protects macrophages from ER stress-induced apoptosis by activating an IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway via a nonenzymatic mechanism. These data suggest a novel action and mechanism of eNampt that could affect the balance of macrophage survival and death in the setting of obesity, which in turn could play important roles in obesity-associated diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Recent reports suggest dyslipidemia impairs dendritic cell (DC) function and adaptive immunity. This study aimed to characterize the effect of hypercholesterolemia on antigen-presenting cell function of DCs and DC-dependent CD4(+) T-cell responses. DCs incubated in vitro with acetylated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with or without an acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyl-transferase inhibitor maintained their ability to prime CD4(+) T cells. Analysis of T-cell proliferation and interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production after ex vivo coculture of na\u00efve CD4(+) T cells with splenic, inguinal, or iliac DCs from low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (LDLR(-/-)) or apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice fed an atherogenic diet highlighted DC efficacy in effector T-cell generation under hypercholesterolemic conditions. Adoptive transfer of carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled na\u00efve CD4(+) T cells in LDLR(-/-) recipients and subsequent immunization demonstrated effective priming of na\u00efve T cells in hypercholesterolemic mice. CFSE dilution analyses revealed that hypercholesterolemic DCs were equipotent in na\u00efve CD4(+) T-cell priming efficacy with normocholesterolemic DCs. Quantitative real-time PCR and flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that DC expression of multiple molecules involved in antigen processing, presentation, and T-cell stimulation remained unaltered by dyslipidemia. Finally, endogenous antigen-primed CD4(+) T cells responded equivalently to a secondary ex vivo antigenic challenge, regardless of whether they were primed in vivo under hypercholesterolemic or control conditions, demonstrating that all essential steps in CD4(+) T-cell responses remain intact under atherogenic conditions. This study affirms that the adaptive immune response prevails under the hypercholesterolemic conditions present in atherosclerosis. In particular, DCs remain functional antigen-presenting cells and maintain their ability to prime CD4(+) T cells even when cholesterol-loaded.",

        "Abstract": "Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is needed to assemble chylomicrons in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of enterocytes. We explored the role of an ER stress protein, inositol-requiring enzyme 1beta (IRE1beta), in regulating this process. High-cholesterol and high-fat diets decreased intestinal IRE1beta mRNA in wild-type mice. Ire1b(-/-) mice fed high-cholesterol and high-fat diets developed more pronounced hyperlipidemia because these mice secreted more chylomicrons and expressed more intestinal MTP, though not hepatic MTP, than wild-type mice did. Chylomicron secretion and MTP expression also were increased in primary enterocytes isolated from cholesterol-fed Ire1b(-/-) mice. There was no correlation between ER stress and MTP expression. Instead, cell culture studies revealed that IRE1beta, but not its ubiquitous homolog IRE1alpha, decreased MTP mRNA through increased posttranscriptional degradation. Conversely, knockdown of IRE1beta enhanced MTP expression. These studies show that IRE1beta plays a role in regulating MTP and in chylomicron production.",

Necrotic cores result from the combination of macrophage apoptosis and defective phagocytic clearance (efferocytosis) of these apoptotic cells.

        "Abstract": "Macrophage death in advanced atherosclerosis causes plaque necrosis, which promotes plaque rupture and acute atherothrombotic vascular events. Of interest, plaque necrosis and atherothrombotic disease are markedly increased in diabetes and metabolic syndrome. We discovered a novel 'multi-hit' macrophage apoptosis pathway that appears to be highly relevant to advanced atherosclerosis. The elements of the pathway include: (a) activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) by cholesterol overloading of the endoplasmic reticulum or by other UPR activators known to exist in atheromata; and (b) pro-apoptotic signalling involving the type A scavenger receptor (SRA). The downstream apoptosis effectors include CHOP (GADD153) for the UPR and JNK for SRA signalling. Remarkably, components of this pathway are enhanced in macrophages with defective insulin signalling, including UPR activation and SRA expression. As a result, insulin-resistant macrophages show increased susceptibility to apoptosis when exposed to UPR activators and SRA ligands. Moreover, the advanced lesions of atherosclerosis-prone mice reconstituted with insulin-resistant macrophages show increased macrophage apoptosis and plaque necrosis. Based on these findings, we propose that one mechanism of increased plaque necrosis and atherothrombotic vascular disease in insulin resistant syndromes is up-regulation of a two-hit signal transduction pathway involved in advanced lesional macrophage death.",

In vitro and in vivo data suggest that macrophage apoptosis in advanced atheromata may be triggered by a combination of endoplasmic reticulum stress and engagement of the type A scavenger receptor, which together induce death through a rise in cytosolic calcium and activation of toll-like receptor-4.",

        "Title": "Apoptosis and efferocytosis in mouse models of atherosclerosis.",
        "Abstract": "Throughout the process of atherosclerosis, lesional macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and possibly endothelial cells undergo programmed cell death, or apoptosis. Under normal physiologic conditions, apoptotic cells are rapidly cleared by neighboring phagocytes, a process called efferocytosis, which prevents secondary cellular necrosis and inflammation. If efferocytosis is not efficient, necrosis, inflammation, and tissue damage ensue. Mouse models of atherosclerosis offer the best opportunity to understand the mechanisms and consequences of lesional cell apoptosis and efferocytosis in atherogenesis and plaque progression. Studies in mice to date have suggested that properly coupled macrophage apoptosis and efferocytosis in early atherosclerosis limits lesion size. The results of other mouse studies suggest that macrophage and smooth muscle cell apoptosis and defective efferocytosis in advanced lesions promotes plaque necrosis. Future insight into these critically important processes will require additional insight into the molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to lesional cell apoptosis and efferocytosis as well as new mouse models of plaque disruption and thrombosis. Advances in these areas offer great hope for eventual translation into innovative therapeutic strategies to combat atherothrombotic vascular disease.",

        "Title": "Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy in higher eukaryotes.",
        "Abstract": "Research in autophagy continues to accelerate,(1) and as a result many new scientists are entering the field. Accordingly, it is important to establish a standard set of criteria for monitoring macroautophagy in different organisms. Recent reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose.(2,3) There are many useful and convenient methods that can be used to monitor macroautophagy in yeast, but relatively few in other model systems, and there is much confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure macroautophagy in higher eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers of autophagosomes versus those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway; thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from fully functional autophagy that includes delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of the methods that can be used by investigators who are attempting to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as by reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that investigate these processes. This set of guidelines is not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to verify an autophagic response.",

        "Title": "Subendothelial lipoprotein retention as the initiating process in atherosclerosis: update and therapeutic implications.",
        "Abstract": "The key initiating process in atherogenesis is the subendothelial retention of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. Local biological responses to these retained lipoproteins, including a chronic and maladaptive macrophage- and T-cell-dominated inflammatory response, promote subsequent lesion development. The most effective therapy against atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease to date--low density lipoprotein-lowering drugs--is based on the principle that decreasing circulating apolipoprotein B lipoproteins decreases the probability that they will enter and be retained in the subendothelium. Ongoing improvements in this area include more aggressive lowering of low-density lipoprotein and other atherogenic lipoproteins in the plasma and initiation of low-density lipoprotein-lowering therapy at an earlier age in at-risk individuals. Potential future therapeutic approaches include attempts to block the interaction of apolipoprotein B lipoproteins with the specific subendothelial matrix molecules that mediate retention and to interfere with accessory molecules within the arterial wall that promote retention such as lipoprotein lipase, secretory sphingomyelinase, and secretory phospholipase A2. Although not the primary focus of this review, therapeutic strategies that target the proatherogenic responses to retained lipoproteins and that promote the removal of atherogenic components of retained lipoproteins also hold promise. The finding that certain human populations of individuals who maintain lifelong low plasma levels of apolipoprotein B lipoproteins have an approximately 90% decreased risk of coronary artery disease gives hope that our further understanding of the pathogenesis of this leading killer could lead to its eradication.",

        "Title": "Attenuated free cholesterol loading-induced apoptosis but preserved phospholipid composition of peritoneal macrophages from mice that do not express group VIA phospholipase A2.",
        "Abstract": "Mouse macrophages undergo ER stress and apoptosis upon free cholesterol loading (FCL). We recently generated iPLA(2)beta-null mice, and here we demonstrate that iPLA(2)beta-null macrophages have reduced sensitivity to FCL-induced apoptosis, although they and wild-type (WT) cells exhibit similar increases in the transcriptional regulator CHOP. iPLA(2)beta-null macrophages are also less sensitive to apoptosis induced by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin and the scavenger receptor A ligand fucoidan, and restoring iPLA(2)betaexpression with recombinant adenovirus increases apoptosis toward WT levels. WT and iPLA(2)beta-null macrophages incorporate [(3)H]arachidonic acid ([(3)H]AA]) into glycerophosphocholine lipids equally rapidly and exhibit identical zymosan-induced, cPLA(2)alpha-catalyzed [(3)H]AA release. In contrast, although WT macrophages exhibit robust [(3)H]AA release upon FCL, this is attenuated in iPLA(2)beta-null macrophages and increases toward WT levels upon restoring iPLA(2)beta expression. Recent reports indicate that iPLA(2)beta modulates mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and we find that thapsigargin and fucoidan induce mitochondrial phospholipid loss and cytochrome c release into WT macrophage cytosol and that these events are blunted in iPLA(2)beta-null cells. Immunoblotting studies indicate that iPLA(2)beta associates with mitochondria in macrophages subjected to ER stress. AA incorporation into glycerophosphocholine lipids is unimpaired in iPLA(2)beta-null macrophages upon electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analyses, and their complex lipid composition is similar to WT cells. These findings suggest that iPLA(2)beta participates in ER stress-induced macrophage apoptosis caused by FCL or thapsigargin but that deletion of iPLA(2)beta does not impair macrophage arachidonate incorporation or phospholipid composition.",

        "Title": "Pivotal advance: macrophages become resistant to cholesterol-induced death after phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.",
        "Abstract": "One of the most important functions of macrophages is the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (ACs). ACs deliver large amounts membrane-derived cholesterol to phagocytes, which, if not handled properly, can be cytotoxic. In atherosclerosis, where the ACs are cholesterol-loaded, this situation is exaggerated, because the ACs deliver both endogenous membrane cholesterol and stored lipoprotein-derived cholesterol. To examine how phagocytes handle this very large amount of cholesterol, we incubated macrophage phagocytes with cholesterol-loaded ACs. Our results show that the phagocytes call into play a number of cellular responses to protect them from cholesterol-induced cytotoxicity. First, through efficient trafficking of the internalized AC-derived cholesterol to acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) in the endoplasmic reticulum, phagocytes efficiently esterify the cholesterol and thus prevent its toxic effects. However, the phagocytes show no signs of cytotoxicity even when ACAT is rendered dysfunctional, as might occur in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Under these conditions, the phagocytes remain viable through massive efflux of AC-derived cholesterol. Remarkably, these phagocytes still show a survival response even when high cholesterol levels are maintained in the post-phagocytosis period by subsequent incubation with atherogenic lipoproteins, as also may occur in atheromata. In this case, death in phagocytes is prevented by activation of survival pathways involving PI-3 kinase/Akt and NF-kappaB. Thus, macrophages that have ingested ACs successfully employ three survival mechanisms -- cholesterol esterification, massive cholesterol efflux, and cell-survival signaling. These findings have implications for macrophage physiology in both AC clearance and atherosclerotic plaque progression.",

        "Title": "A two-carbon switch to sterol-induced autophagic death.",
        "Abstract": "Although both cholesterol and plant sterols are abundant in our diets, our intestinal epithelial cells selectively and efficiently rid the body of plant sterols. However, a rare mutation in plant sterol excretion in humans results in the accumulation of plant sterols, particularly sitosterol, in the plasma and tissues. Sitosterol differs from cholesterol only in an extra ethyl group on the sterol side chain. Significantly, sitosterolemia is associated with accelerated atherothrombotic vascular disease, notably myocardial infarction. An important process that promotes atherothrombosis is advanced lesional macrophage death, leading to plaque necrosis. One of the causes of atherosclerotic macrophage death is sterol-induced cytotoxicity. We therefore compared the effects of excess intracellular sitosterol vs. cholesterol on macrophage death. Whereas excess cholesterol kills macrophages by caspase-dependent apoptosis, sitosterol kills macrophages by a caspase-independent pathway involving necroptosis and autophagy. The finding that an ethyl group on the sterol side chain fundamentally alters the way cells respond to excess sterols adds new insight into the mechanisms of sterol-induced cell death and may provide at least one explanation for the excess atherosclerotic heart disease in patients with sitosterolemia.",

        "Title": "Combinatorial pattern recognition receptor signaling alters the balance of life and death in macrophages.",
        "Abstract": "Macrophage pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play key roles in innate immunity, but they also may contribute to disease processes under certain pathological conditions. We recently showed that engagement of the type A scavenger receptor (SRA), a PRR, triggers JNK-dependent apoptosis in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stressed macrophages. In advanced atherosclerotic lesions, the SRA, activated JNK, and ER stress are observed in macrophages, and macrophage death in advanced atheromata leads to plaque necrosis. Herein, we show that SRA ligands trigger apoptosis in ER-stressed macrophages by cooperating with another PRR, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), to redirect TLR4 signaling from prosurvival to proapoptotic. Common SRA ligands activate both TLR4 signaling and engage the SRA. The TLR4 effect results in activation of the proapoptotic MyD88-JNK branch of TLR4, whereas the SRA effect silences the prosurvival IRF-3-IFN-beta branch of TLR4. The normal cell-survival effect of LPS-induced TLR4 activation is converted into an apoptosis response by immunoneutralization of IFN-beta, and the apoptosis effect of SRA ligands is converted into a cell-survival response by reconstitution with IFN-beta. Thus, combinatorial signaling between two distinct PRRs results in a functional outcome-macrophage apoptosis that does not occur with either PRR alone. PRR-induced macrophage death may play important roles in advanced atherosclerosis and in other innate immunity-related processes in which the balance between macrophage survival and death is critical.",

        "Title": "The inflammatory cytokine response of cholesterol-enriched macrophages is dampened by stimulated pinocytosis.",
        "Abstract": "Two features of advanced atherosclerotic lesions are large numbers of macrophages and a heightened state of inflammation. Some of the macrophages appear to be enriched with free cholesterol (FCMphis), and we have shown that this process induces the synthesis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha and IL-6. However, lesions contain many other macrophages that are not FC-enriched (non-FCMphis). Therefore, we sought to understand how the interaction of these two populations of macrophages would influence the inflammatory response. We show here that non-FCMphis possess a robust ability to deplete TNF-alpha and IL-6 secreted by FCMphis. The mechanism involves enhanced pinocytic uptake and lysosomal degradation of the FCMphi-secreted cytokines by the non-FCMphis. The FCMphis contribute directly to this process by secreting pinocytosis-stimulatory factors that act on non-FCMphis but not on the FCMphis themselves. One of these pinocytosis-stimulatory factors is M-CSF, which is induced by a process involving cholesterol trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum and signaling through PI-3K and ERK MAPK pathways. However, one or more other FCMphi-secreted factors are also required for stimulating pinocytosis in non-FCMphis. Thus, FCMphis secrete inflammatory cytokines as well as factors that promote the eventual pinocytosis and degradation of these cytokines by neighboring macrophages. This process may normally serve to prevent prolonged or disseminated effects of inflammatory cytokines during inflammation. Moreover, possible perturbation of stimulated pinocytosis during the progression of advanced atherosclerosis may contribute to the heightened inflammatory state of these lesions.",

        "Title": "Sitosterol-containing lipoproteins trigger free sterol-induced caspase-independent death in ACAT-competent macrophages.",
        "Abstract": "Sitosterolemia is a disease characterized by very high levels of sitosterol and other plant sterols and premature atherothrombotic vascular disease. One theory holds that plant sterols can directly promote atherosclerosis, but the mechanism is not known. Unesterified, or \"free,\" cholesterol (FC) is a potent inducer of macrophage death, which causes plaque necrosis, a precursor to atherothrombosis. FC-induced macrophage death, however, requires dysfunction of the sterol esterifying enzyme acyl-coenzyme A-cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), which likely occurs slowly during lesion progression. In contrast, plant sterols are relatively poorly esterified by ACAT, and so they may cause macrophage death and plaque necrosis in an accelerated manner. In support of this hypothesis, we show here that macrophages incubated with sitosterol-containing lipoproteins accumulate free sterols and undergo death in the absence of an ACAT inhibitor. As with FC loading, sitosterol-induced macrophage death requires sterol trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum, and sitosterol-enriched endoplasmic reticulum membranes show evidence of membrane protein dysfunction. However, whereas FC induces caspase-dependent apoptosis through activation of the unfolded protein response and JNK, sitosterol-induced death is caspase-independent and involves neither the unfolded protein response nor JNK. Rather, cell death shows signs of necroptosis and autophagy and is suppressed by inhibitors of both processes. These data establish two new concepts. First, a relatively subtle change in sterol structure fundamentally alters the type of death program triggered in macrophages. Understanding the basis of this alteration should provide new insights into the molecular basis of death pathway signaling. Second, sitosterol-induced macrophage death does not require ACAT dysfunction and so may occur in an accelerated fashion. Pending future in vivo studies, this concept may provide at least one mechanism for accelerated plaque necrosis and atherothrombotic disease in patients with sitosterolemia.",

        "Abstract": "Plasma sphingomyelin has been shown to be an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, but the relation of plasma sphingomyelin to earlier, subclinical atherosclerotic disease has not been reported. The authors examined the association between plasma sphingomyelin and three measures of subclinical cardiovascular disease (carotid intimal-medial wall thickness, ankle-arm blood pressure index, and Agatston coronary artery calcium score) among 6,814 middle-aged, asymptomatic adults in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, which was initiated in 2000. The sphingomyelin level was positively correlated with lipids and the Framingham risk score (p < 0.01 for both), and the mean level was higher in women than men (50 (standard deviation (SD), 16) vs. 45 (SD, 15) mg/dl) (p < 0.01) and higher in never versus current smokers (49 (SD, 16) vs. 45 (SD, 17) mg/dl) (p < 0.01). Women with sphingomyelin levels of 60 or more mg/dl had more severe subclinical disease by all three measures than did the referent group with sphingomyelin levels of 39 or less mg/dl, although associations were not significant after multivariate adjustment for standard cardiovascular disease risk factors. Men with sphingomyelin levels of 60 or more mg/dl versus those with sphingomyelin levels of 39 or less mg/dl had higher calcium scores (135 vs. 99 Agatston units) (p = 0.01). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that plasma sphingomyelin is in the biologic pathway that mediates the risk for subclinical disease attributable to standard cardiovascular disease risk factors.",

        "Abstract": "Insulin resistance in diabetes and metabolic syndrome is thought to increase susceptibility to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To evaluate the possibility that decreased insulin signaling in macrophage foam cells might worsen atherosclerosis, Ldlr(-/-) mice were transplanted with insulin receptor Insr(+/+) or Insr(-/-) bone marrow. Western diet-fed Insr(-/-) recipients developed larger, more complex lesions with increased necrotic cores and increased numbers of apoptotic cells. Insr(-/-) macrophages showed diminished Akt phosphorylation and an augmented ER stress response, leading to induction of scavenger receptor A and increased apoptosis when challenged with cholesterol loading or nutrient deprivation. These studies suggest that defective insulin signaling and reduced Akt activity impair the ability of macrophages to deal with ER stress-induced apoptosis within atherosclerotic plaques.",

        "Title": "TNFalpha induces ABCA1 through NF-kappaB in macrophages and in phagocytes ingesting apoptotic cells.",
        "Abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) signaling in vascular cells can have antiatherogenic consequences, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. TNFalpha is released by free cholesterol-loaded apoptotic macrophages, and the clearance of these cells by phagocytic macrophages may help to limit plaque development. Macrophage cholesterol uptake induces ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCA1 promoting cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I and reducing atherosclerosis. We show that TNFalpha induces ABCA1 mRNA and protein in control and cholesterol-loaded macrophages and enhances cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I. The induction of ABCA1 by TNFalpha is reduced by 65% in IkappaB kinase beta-deficient macrophages and by 30% in p38alpha-deficient macrophages, but not in jun kinase 1 (JNK1)- or JNK2-deficient macrophages. To evaluate the potential pathophysiological significance of these observations, we fed TNFalpha-secreting free cholesterol-loaded apoptotic macrophages to a healthy macrophage monolayer (phagocytes). ABCA1 mRNA and protein were markedly induced in the phagocytes, a response that was mediated both by TNFalpha signaling and by liver X receptor activation. Thus, TNFalpha signals primarily through NF-kappaB to induce ABCA1 expression in macrophages. In atherosclerotic plaques, this process may help phagocytic macrophages to efflux excess lipids derived from the ingestion of cholesterol-rich apoptotic corpses.",

        "Abstract": "Macrophage apoptosis and the ability of phagocytes to clear these apoptotic cells are important processes in advanced atherosclerosis. Phagocytic clearance not only disposes of dead cells but usually elicits an anti-inflammatory response. To study this process in a model of advanced lesional macrophage death, macrophages rendered apoptotic by free cholesterol loading (FC-AMs) were incubated briefly with fresh macrophages (\"phagocytes\"). FC-AMs were promptly ingested by the phagocytes, which was dependent upon actin polymerization and the phagocyte Mer receptor. Surprisingly, this brief exposure to FC-AMs triggered a modest proinflammatory response in the phagocytes: tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-1beta were induced, whereas the levels of transforming growth factor-beta and IL-10 were not increased. This response required cell contact between the FC-AMs and phagocytes but not FC-AM ingestion. TNF-alpha and IL-1beta induction required one or more proteins on the FC-AM surface and was dependent on signaling through extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappaB in the phagocytes. TNF-alpha production was markedly greater when Mer-defective phagocytes were used, indicating that Mer attenuated the inflammatory response. Interestingly, a more typical anti-inflammatory response was elicited when phagocytes were exposed to macrophages rendered apoptotic by oxidized low density lipoprotein or UV radiation. Thus, the proinflammatory milieu of advanced atherosclerotic lesions may be promoted, or at least not dampened, by contact between FC-induced apoptotic macrophages and neighboring phagocytes prior to apoptotic cell ingestion.",

        "Abstract": "Macrophage death in advanced atherosclerosis promotes necrosis and plaque destabilization. A likely cause of macrophage death is accumulation of free cholesterol (FC) in the ER, leading to activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)-induced apoptosis. Here we show that p38 MAPK signaling is necessary for CHOP induction and apoptosis. Additionally, two other signaling pathways must cooperate with p38-CHOP to effect apoptosis. One involves the type A scavenger receptor (SRA). As evidence, FC loading by non-SRA mechanisms activates p38 and CHOP, but not apoptosis unless the SRA is engaged. The other pathway involves c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)2, which is activated by cholesterol trafficking to the ER, but is independent of CHOP. Thus, FC-induced apoptosis requires cholesterol trafficking to the ER, which triggers p38-CHOP and JNK2, and engagement of the SRA. These findings have important implications for understanding how the UPR, MAPKs, and the SRA might conspire to cause macrophage death, lesional necrosis, and plaque destabilization in advanced atherosclerotic lesions.",

        "Abstract": "Macrophage apoptosis occurs throughout all stages of atherosclerosis, yet new findings in vivo suggest that the consequences of this event may be very different in early versus late atherosclerotic lesions. In early lesions, where phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells appears to be efficient, macrophage apoptosis is associated with diminished lesion cellularity and decreased lesion progression. In late lesions, however, a number of factors may contribute to defective phagocytic clearance of apoptotic macrophages, leading to secondary necrosis of these cells and a proinflammatory response. The cumulative effect of these late lesional events is generation of the necrotic core, which, in concert with proatherogenic effects of residual surviving macrophages, promotes further inflammation, plaque instability, and thrombosis. Thus, the ability or lack thereof of lesional phagocytes to safely clear apoptotic macrophages may be an important determinant of acute atherothrombotic clinical events. Further understanding of the mechanisms involved in macrophage apoptosis and phagocytic clearance might lead to novel therapeutic strategies directed against the progression of advanced plaques.",

        "Title": "Physiological regulation of phospholipid methylation alters plasma homocysteine in mice.",
        "Abstract": "Biological methylation reactions and homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism are intimately linked. In previous work, we have shown that phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, an enzyme that methylates phosphatidylethanolamine to form phosphatidylcholine, plays a significant role in the regulation of plasma Hcy levels through an effect on methylation demand (Noga, A. A., Stead, L. M., Zhao, Y., Brosnan, M. E., Brosnan, J. T., and Vance, D. E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 5952-5955). We have further investigated methylation demand and Hcy metabolism in liver-specific CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase-alpha (CTalpha) knockout mice, since flux through the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase pathway is increased 2-fold to meet hepatic demand for phosphatidylcholine. Our data show that plasma Hcy is elevated by 20-40% in mice lacking hepatic CTalpha. CTalpha-deficient hepatocytes secrete 40% more Hcy into the medium than do control hepatocytes. Liver activity of betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase and methionine adenosyltransferase are elevated in the knockout mice as a mechanism for maintaining normal hepatic S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine levels. These data suggest that phospholipid methylation in the liver is a major consumer of AdoMet and a significant source of plasma Hcy.",

        "Abstract": "Two key features of atherosclerotic plaques that precipitate acute atherothrombotic vascular occlusion (\"vulnerable plaques\") are abundant inflammatory mediators and macrophages with excess unesterified, or \"free,\" cholesterol (FC). Herein we show that FC accumulation in macrophages leads to the induction and secretion of two inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The increases in TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA and protein were mediated by FC-induced activation of the IkappaB kinase/NF-kappaB pathway as well as activation of MKK3/p38, Erk1/2, and JNK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Activation of IkappaB kinase and JNK1/2 was needed for the induction of both cytokines. However, MKK3/p38 signaling was specifically involved in TNF-alpha induction, and Erk1/2 signaling was required for IL-6. Most interestingly, activation of all of the signaling pathways and induction of both cytokines required cholesterol trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The CHOP branch of the unfolded protein response, an ER stress pathway, was required for Erk1/2 activation and IL-6 induction. In contrast, one or more other ER-related pathways were responsible for activation of p38, JNK1/2, and IkappaB kinase/NF-kappaB and for the induction of TNF-alpha. These data suggest a novel scenario in which cytokines are induced in macrophages by endogenous cellular events triggered by excess ER cholesterol rather than by exogenous immune cell mediators. Moreover, this model may help explain the relationship between FC accumulation and inflammation in vulnerable plaques.",

        "Abstract": "Transport of the fluorescent cholesterol analog dehydroergosterol (DHE) from the plasma membrane was studied in J774 macrophages (Mphis) with normal and elevated cholesterol content. Cells were labeled with DHE bound to methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. In J774, Mphis with normal cholesterol, intracellular DHE became enriched in recycling endosomes, but was not highly concentrated in the trans-Golgi network or late endosomes and lysosomes. After raising cellular cholesterol by incubation with acetylated low-density lipoprotein (AcLDL), DHE was transported to lipid droplets, and less sterol was found in recycling endosomes. Transport of DHE to droplets was very rapid (t1/2 = 1.5 min after photobleaching) and did not require metabolic energy. In cholesterol-loaded J774 Mphis, the initial fraction of DHE in the plasma membrane was reduced, and rapid DHE efflux from the plasma membrane to intracellular organelles was observed. This rapid sterol transport was not related to plasma membrane vesiculation, as DHE did not become enriched in endocytic vesicles formed after sphingomyelinase C treatment of cells. When cells were incubated with DHE ester incorporated into AcLDL, fluorescence of the sterol was first found in punctate endosomes. After a chase, this DHE colocalized with transferrin in a distribution similar to cells labeled with DHE delivered by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Our results indicate that elevation of sterol levels in Mphis enhances transport of sterol from the plasma membrane by a non-vesicular pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Secreted extracellular acid sphingomyelinase (sASM) activity has been suggested to promote atherosclerosis by enhancing subendothelial aggregation and retention of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) with resultant foam cell formation. Compounds that inhibit sASM activity, at neutral pH, may prevent lipid retention and thus would be expected to be anti-atherosclerotic. With the goal of identifying novel compounds that inhibit sASM at pH 7.4, a high-throughput screen was performed. Initial screening was run using a modification of a proven system that measures the hydrolysis of radiolabeled sphingomyelin presented in detergent micelles in a 96-well format. Separation of the radiolabeled aqueous phosphorylcholine reaction product from uncleaved sphingomyelin lipid substrate was achieved by chloroform/methanol extraction. During the screening campaign, a novel extraction procedure was developed to eliminate the use of the hazardous organic reagents. This new procedure exploited the ability of uncleaved, radiolabeled lipid substrate to interact with hydrophobic phenyl-sepharose beads. A comparison of the organic-based and the bead-based extraction sASM screening assays revealed Z' factor values ranging from 0.7 to 0.95 for both formats. In addition, both assay formats led to the identification of sub- to low micromolar inhibitors of sASM at pH 7.4 with similar IC(50) values. Subsequent studies demonstrated that both methods were also adaptable to run in a 384-well format. In contrast to the results observed at neutral pH, however, only the organic extraction assay was capable of accurately measuring sASM activity at its pH optimum of 5.0. The advantages and disadvantages of both sASM assay formats are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) catalyzes a rate-controlling step in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho). Multiple CCT isoforms, CCTalpha, CCTbeta2, and CCTbeta3, are encoded by two genes, Pcyt1a and Pcyt1b. The importance of CCTalpha in mice was investigated by deleting exons 5 and 6 in the Pcyt1a gene using the Cre-lox system. Pcyt1a-/- zygotes failed to form blastocysts, did not develop past embryonic day 3.5 (E3.5), and failed to implant. In situ hybridization in E11.5 embryos showed that Pcyt1a is expressed ubiquitously, with the highest level in fetal liver, and CCTalpha transcripts are significantly more abundant than transcripts encoding CCTbeta or phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) N-methyl transferase, two other enzymes capable of producing PtdCho. Reduction of the CCTalpha transcripts in heterozygous E11.5 embryos was accompanied by upregulation of CCTbeta and PtdEtn N-methyltransferase transcripts. In contrast, enzymatic and real-time PCR data revealed that CCTbeta (Pcyt1b) expression is not upregulated to compensate for the reduction in CCTalpha expression in adult liver and other tissues from Pcyt1a+/- heterozygous mice. PtdCho biosynthesis measured by choline incorporation into isolated hepatocytes was not compromised in the Pcyt1a+/- mice. Liver PtdCho mass was the same in Pcyt1a+/+ and Pcyt1a+/- adult animals, but lung PtdCho mass decreased in the heterozygous mice. These data show that CCTalpha expression is required for early embryonic development, but that a 50% reduction in enzyme activity has little detectable impact on the operation of the CDP-choline metabolic pathway in adult tissues.",

        "Title": "Decreased lipid efflux and increased susceptibility to cholesterol-induced apoptosis in macrophages lacking phosphatidylcholine transfer protein.",
        "Abstract": "Macrophages are the predominant cellular component of atherosclerotic lesions, where they scavenge oxidatively modified lipoproteins while defending themselves against cholesterol-induced cytotoxicity by adaptive mechanisms that depend in part on the synthesis, distribution and efflux of phosphatidylcholines. PC-TP (phosphatidylcholine transfer protein) is a START (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer) domain protein that catalyses the intermembrane transfer of phosphatidylcholines and promotes apolipoprotein AI-mediated lipid efflux when overexpressed in the cytosol of Chinese-hamster ovary cells. To explore a role for PC-TP in the adaptive responses of macrophages to cholesterol loading, we utilized peritoneal macrophages from mice with homozygous disruption of the gene encoding PC-TP (Pctp(-/-)) and wild-type littermate controls. PC-TP was abundantly expressed in macrophages from wild-type but not Pctp(-/-) mice. In cholesteryl ester-loaded macrophages from Pctp(-/-) mice, the apolipoprotein AI-mediated efflux of phospholipids and cholesterol was decreased. This could be attributed to proportional decreases in the expression levels of ATP-binding cassette A1. Also, in response to free cholesterol loading, the absence of PC-TP from macrophages was associated with marked increases in apoptotic cell death. These findings suggest that PC-TP in macrophages may serve an atheroprotective role by defending against cholesterol-induced cytotoxicity.",

        "Abstract": "CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) is the key regulatory enzyme in the CDP-choline pathway for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine. Hepatic cells express both an alpha and a beta2 isoform of CT and can also synthesize phosphatidylcholine via the sequential methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine catalyzed by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase. To ascertain the functional importance of CTalpha, we created a mouse in which the hepatic CTalpha gene was specifically inactivated by the Cre/LoxP procedure. In CTalpha knockout mice, hepatic CT activity (due to residual CTbeta2 activity as well as activity in nonhepatic cells) was 15% of normal, whereas phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity was elevated 2-fold compared with controls. Lipid analyses of the liver indicated that female knockout mice had reduced phosphatidylcholine levels and accumulated triacylglycerols. The plasma phosphatidylcholine concentration was reduced in the CTalpha knockout (independent of gender), as were levels of high density lipoproteins (cholesterol and apoAI) and very low density lipoproteins (triacylglycerols and apoB100). Experiments in which mice were injected with Triton WR1339 indicated that apoB secretion was decreased in hepatic-specific CTalpha knockout mice compared with controls. These results suggest an important role for hepatic CTalpha in regulating both hepatic and systemic lipid and lipoprotein metabolism.",

        "Title": "Enrichment of endoplasmic reticulum with cholesterol inhibits sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase-2b activity in parallel with increased order of membrane lipids: implications for depletion of endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores and apoptosis in cholesterol-loaded macrophages.",
        "Abstract": "Macrophages in advanced atherosclerotic lesions accumulate large amounts of unesterified, or \"free,\" cholesterol (FC). FC accumulation induces macrophage apoptosis, which likely contributes to plaque destabilization. Apoptosis is triggered by the enrichment of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with FC, resulting in depletion of ER calcium stores, and induction of the unfolded protein response. To explain the mechanism of ER calcium depletion, we hypothesized that FC enrichment of the normally cholesterol-poor ER membrane inhibits the macrophage ER calcium pump, sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase-2b (SERCA2b). FC enrichment of ER membranes to a level similar to that occurring in vivo inhibited both the ATPase activity and calcium sequestration function of SERCA2b. Enrichment of ER with ent-cholesterol or 14:0-18:0 phosphatidylcholine, which possess the membrane-ordering properties of cholesterol, also inhibited SERCA2b. Moreover, at various levels of FC enrichment of ER membranes, there was a very close correlation between increasing membrane lipid order, as monitored by 16-doxyl-phosphatidycholine electron spin resonance, and SERCA2b inhibition. In view of these data, we speculate that SERCA2b, a conformationally active protein with 11 membrane-spanning regions, loses function due to decreased conformational freedom in FC-ordered membranes. This biophysical model may underlie the critical connection between excess cholesterol, unfolded protein response induction, macrophage death, and plaque destabilization in advanced atherosclerosis.",

        "Abstract": "Accelerated atherosclerosis is a major cause of morbidity and death in insulin-resistant states such as obesity and the metabolic syndrome, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We show that macrophages from obese (ob/ob) mice have increased binding and uptake of oxidized LDL, in part due to a post-transcriptional increase in CD36 protein. Macrophages from ob/ob mice are also insulin resistant, as shown by reduced expression and signaling of insulin receptors. Three lines of evidence indicate that the increase in CD36 is caused by defective insulin signaling: (a) Treatment of wild-type macrophages with LY294002, an inhibitor of insulin signaling via PI3K, results in an increase in CD36; (b) insulin receptor knockout macrophages show a post-transcriptional increase in CD36 protein; and (c) administration of thiazolidinediones to intact ob/ob mice and ob/ob, LDL receptor-deficient mice results in a reversal of macrophage insulin receptor defects and decreases CD36 protein. The last finding contrasts with the increase in CD36 that results from treatment of macrophages with these drugs ex vivo. The results suggest that defective macrophage insulin signaling predisposes to foam cell formation and atherosclerosis in insulin-resistant states and that this is reversed in vivo by treatment with PPAR-gamma activators.",

        "Title": "Suppression of macrophage eicosanoid synthesis by atherogenic lipoproteins is profoundly affected by cholesterol-fatty acyl esterification and the Niemann-Pick C pathway of lipid trafficking.",
        "Abstract": "Atheroma macrophages internalize large quantities of lipoprotein-derived lipids. While most emphasis has been placed on cholesterol, lipoprotein-derived fatty acids may also play important roles in lesional macrophage biology. Little is known, however, about the trafficking or metabolism of these fatty acids. In this study, we first show that the cholesterol-fatty acyl esterification reaction, catalyzed by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), competes for the incorporation of lipoprotein-derived fatty acids into cellular phospholipids. Furthermore, conditions that inhibit trafficking of cholesterol from late endosomes/lysosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such as the amphipathic amine U18666A and the Npc1+/- mutation, also inhibit incorporation of lipoprotein-derived fatty acids into phospholipids. The biological relevance of these findings was investigated by studying the suppression of agonist-induced prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and leukotriene C(4)/D(4)/E(4) production during lipoprotein uptake by macrophages, which has been postulated to involve enrichment of cellular phospholipids with non-arachidonic fatty acids (NAAFAs). We found that eicosanoid suppression was markedly enhanced when ACAT was inhibited and prevented when late endosomal/lysosomal lipid trafficking was blocked. Moreover, PGE(2) suppression depended entirely on acetyl-LDL-derived NAAFAs, not on acetyl-LDL-cholesterol, and was not due to decreased cPLA(2) activity per se. These data support the following model: lipoprotein-derived NAAFAs traffic via the NPC1 pathway from late endosomes/lysosomes to a critical pool of phospholipids. In competing reactions, these NAAFAs can be either esterified to cholesterol or incorporated into phospholipids, resulting in suppression of eicosanoid biosynthesis. In view of recent evidence suggesting dysfunctional cholesterol esterification in late lesional macrophages, these data predict that such cells would have highly suppressed eicosanoid synthesis, thus affecting eicosanoid-mediated cell signaling in advanced atherosclerosis.",

        "Abstract": "The macrophage LDL receptor and LDL receptor-related protein (LRP, CD91) mediate the phagocytic-like uptake of atherogenic lipoproteins and apoptotic cells, yet the structural basis of their phagocytic functions is not known. To address this issue, we transfected macrophages with chimeric proteins containing the cytoplasmic tails and transmembrane regions of the LDL receptor or LRP and the ectodomain of CD2, which can bind non-opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBCs). Macrophages expressing receptors containing the LDL receptor domains were able to bind but not internalize SRBCs. In contrast, macrophages expressing receptors containing the cytoplasmic tail of LRP were able to bind and internalize SRBCs. Chimeras in which the LRP cytoplasmic tail was mutated in two di-leucine motifs and a tyrosine in an NPXYXXL motif were able to endocytose anti-CD2 antibody and bind SRBCs, but SRBC phagocytosis was decreased by 70%. Thus, the phagocytic-like functions of LRP, but not those of the LDL receptor, can be explained by the ability of the LRP cytoplasmic tail to trigger phagocytosis. These findings have important implications for atherogenesis and apoptotic cell clearance and for a fundamental cell biological understanding of how the LDL receptor and LRP function in internalization processes.",

        "Title": "Niemann-Pick C heterozygosity confers resistance to lesional necrosis and macrophage apoptosis in murine atherosclerosis.",
        "Abstract": "Macrophage death in advanced atherosclerotic lesions leads to lesional necrosis and likely promotes plaque instability, a precursor of acute vascular events. Macrophages in advanced lesions accumulate large amounts of unesterified cholesterol, which is a potent inducer of macrophage apoptosis. We have shown recently that induction of apoptosis in cultured macrophages requires cholesterol trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Moreover, macrophages from mice with a heterozygous mutation in the cholesterol-trafficking protein Npc1 have a selective defect in cholesterol trafficking to the ER and are protected from cholesterol-induced apoptosis. The goal of the present study was to test the importance of intracellular cholesterol trafficking in atherosclerotic lesional macrophage death by comparing lesion morphology in Npc1+/+;Apoe-/- and Npc1+/-;Apoe-/- mice. Although advanced lesions in Npc1+/+;Apoe-/- mice had extensive acellular areas that were rich in unesterified cholesterol and macrophage debris, the lesions of Npc1+/-;Apoe-/- mice were substantially more cellular and less necrotic. Moreover, compared with Npc1+/-;Apoe-/- lesions, Npc1+/+;Apoe-/- lesions had a greater number of large, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling)-positive areas surrounding necrotic areas, indicative of macrophage apoptosis. These differences were observed despite similar total lesion area and similar plasma lipid levels in the two groups of mice. These data provide in vivo evidence that intact intracellular cholesterol trafficking is important for macrophage apoptosis in advanced atherosclerotic lesions and that the ER-based model of cholesterol-induced cytotoxicity is physiologically relevant. Moreover, by showing that lesional necrosis can be diminished by a subtle defect in intracellular trafficking, these findings suggest therapeutic strategies to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques.",

The cellular mechanism of cholesterol-induced apoptosis is unknown but had previously been thought to involve the plasma membrane. Here we report that the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum is activated in cholesterol-loaded macrophages, resulting in expression of the cell death effector CHOP. Cholesterol loading depletes endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores, an event known to induce the UPR. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum calcium depletion, the UPR, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis are markedly inhibited by selective inhibition of cholesterol trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum, and Chop-/- macrophages are protected from cholesterol-induced apoptosis. We propose that cholesterol trafficking to endoplasmic reticulum membranes, resulting in activation of the CHOP arm of the UPR, is the key signalling step in cholesterol-induced apoptosis in macrophages.",

        "Title": "ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux is defective in free cholesterol-loaded macrophages. Mechanism involves enhanced ABCA1 degradation in a process requiring full NPC1 activity.",
        "Abstract": "In advanced atherosclerosis, macrophage foam cells progressively accumulate large amounts of unesterified or \"free\" cholesterol (FC), a process that is thought to contribute to foam cell death and lesional necrosis. The cellular consequences of early FC accumulation, including those that lead to further FC accumulation, are poorly understood. In this context, we show that cholesterol and phospholipid efflux mediated by ABCA1, which is initially induced in the cholesterol-loaded macrophage, was inhibited by approximately 80% in pre-toxic FC-loaded macrophages. Cholesterol efflux to HDL(2), which is mediated by a non-ABCA1 pathway, was inhibited by only approximately 20% in FC-loaded macrophages. FC loading led to decreased levels of ABCA1 protein via increased degradation of ABCA1, and not by decreased transcription or translation of AbcA1 mRNA. The decrease in ABCA1 protein occurred relatively early and was not prevented by caspase inhibitors, indicating that it was not a consequence of FC-induced apoptosis. However, inhibition of proteasomal function by lactacystin largely prevented the degradation of ABCA1. Importantly, the FC-induced decrease in ABCA1 function and protein was almost entirely prevented in macrophages that had partial deficiency of npc1 or were exposed to nanomolar concentrations of U18666A, both of which lead to defective cholesterol trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum, but leave trafficking to the plasma membrane largely intact. Thus, a relatively early event during FC loading of macrophages is increased degradation of ABCA1, which appears to require trafficking of cholesterol to a peripheral cellular site, but not bulk trafficking of excess cholesterol to the plasma membrane. These findings provide new insight into the post-translational regulation of ABCA1 and the pathobiology of the FC-loaded macrophage.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory cytokines have been linked to atherosclerosis by using cell culture models and acute inflammation in animals. The goal of this study was to examine lipoprotein levels and early atherosclerosis in chronic animal models of altered IL-1 physiology by using mice with deficient or excess IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). IL-1ra knockout C57BL/6J mice fed a cholesterol/cholate diet for 3 mo had a 3-fold decrease in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a trend toward increased foam-cell lesion area compared to wild-type littermate controls. IL-1ra transgenic/low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) knockout mice fed a cholesterol-saturated fat diet for 10 wk showed a 40% increase in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, consistent with the IL-1ra knockout data, although there was no change in lesion size. When these IL1-ra overexpressing transgenic mice on the LDLR knockout background were fed a high-cholesterol/high-fat diet containing cholate, however, a statistically significant 40% decrease in lesion area was observed compared to LDLR knockout mice lacking the transgene. By immunohistochemistry, IL-1ra was present in C57BL/6J and LDLR knockout aortae, absent in IL-1ra knockout aortae, and present at high levels in LDLR knockout/IL-1ra transgene aortae. In summary, IL-1ra tended to increase plasma lipoprotein levels and, when fed a cholate-containing diet, decrease foam-cell lesion size. These data demonstrate that in selected models of murine atherosclerosis, chronic IL-1ra depletion or overexpression has potentially important effects on lipoprotein metabolism and foam-cell lesion development.",
