        "Abstract": "The evolutionary forces that allowed species adaptation to different terrestrial environments and led to great diversity in body shape and size required acquisition of innovative strategies of pattern formation during organogenesis. An extreme example is the formation of highly elongated viscera in snakes. What developmental patterning strategies allowed to overcome the space constraints of the snake's body to meet physiological demands? Here we show that the corn snake uses a Sox2-Sox9 developmental tool kit common to other species to generate and shape the lung in two phases. Initially Sox9 was found at low levels at the tip of the primary lung bud during outgrowth and elongation of the bronchial bud, without driving branching programs characteristic of mammalian lungs. Later, Sox9 induction is recapitulated in the formation of an extensive network of radial septae emerging along the elongated bronchial bud that generates the respiratory region. We propose that altogether these represent key patterning events for formation of both the respiratory faveolar and non-respiratory posterior compartments of the snake's lung.",

        "Abstract": "Biogenesis of organelles requires targeting of a subset of proteins to specific subcellular domains by signal peptides or mechanisms controlling mRNA localization and local translation. How local distribution and translation of specific mRNAs for organelle biogenesis is achieved remains elusive and likely to be dependent on the cellular context. Here we identify Trinucleotide repeat containing-6a (Tnrc6a), a component of the miRNA pathway, distinctively localized to apical granules of differentiating airway multiciliated cells (MCCs) adjacent to centrioles. In spite of being enriched in TNRC6A and the miRNA-binding protein AGO2, they lack enzymes for mRNA degradation. Instead, we found these apical granules enriched in components of the mRNA translation machinery and newly synthesized proteins suggesting that they are specific hubs for target mRNA localization and local translation in MCCs. Consistent with this, Tnrc6a loss of function prevented formation of these granules and led to a broad reduction, rather than stabilization of miRNA targets. These included downregulation of key genes involved in ciliogenesis and was associated with defective multicilia formation both in vivo and in primary airway epithelial cultures. Similar analysis of Tnrc6a disruption in yolk sac showed stabilization of miRNA targets, highlighting the potential diversity of these mechanisms across organs.",

        "Abstract": "Basal cells are multipotent stem cells of a variety of organs, including the respiratory tract, where they are major components of the airway epithelium. However, it remains unclear how diverse basal cells are and how distinct subpopulations respond to airway challenges. Using single cell RNA-sequencing and functional approaches, we report a significant and previously underappreciated degree of heterogeneity in the basal cell pool, leading to identification of six subpopulations in the adult murine trachea. Among these, we found two major subpopulations, collectively comprising the most uncommitted of all the pools, but with distinct gene expression signatures. Notably, these occupy distinct ventral and dorsal tracheal niches and differ in their ability to self-renew and initiate a program of differentiation in response to environmental perturbations in primary cultures and in mouse injury models in vivo. We found that such heterogeneity is acquired prenatally, when the basal cell pool and local niches are still being established, and depends on the integrity of these niches, as supported by the altered basal cell phenotype of tracheal cartilage-deficient mouse mutants. Finally, we show that features that distinguish these progenitor subpopulations in murine airways are conserved in humans. Together, the data provide novel insights into the origin and impact of basal cell heterogeneity on the establishment of regionally distinct responses of the airway epithelium during injury-repair and in disease conditions.",

Thus far, the roles of these ectopic epithelial cells in alveolar regeneration remain controversial. Here, we confirm that the ectopic tuft cells are originated from EBCs in mouse models and COVID-19 lungs.

Although progenitor functions have been suggested in other organs, pulmonary tuft cells don't proliferate or give rise to other cell lineages. Consistent with previous reports, ",

        "Abstract": "Differences in ciliary morphology and dynamics among multiciliated cells of the respiratory tract contribute to efficient mucociliary clearance. Nevertheless, little is known about how these phenotypic differences are established. We show that Prominin 1 (Prom1), a transmembrane protein widely used as stem cell marker, is crucial to this process. During airway differentiation, Prom1 becomes restricted to multiciliated cells, where it is expressed at distinct levels along the proximal-distal axis of the airways. Prom1 is induced by Notch in multiciliated cells, and Notch inactivation abolishes this gradient of expression. Prom1 was not required for multicilia formation, but when inactivated resulted in longer cilia that beat at a lower frequency. Disruption of Notch resulted in opposite effects and suggested that Notch fine-tunes Prom1 levels to regulate the multiciliated cell phenotype and generate diversity among these cells. This mechanism could contribute to the innate defense of the lung and help prevent pulmonary disease.",

        "Abstract": "Multiciliated cells play critical roles in the airway, reproductive organs, and brain. Generation of multiple cilia requires both activation of a specialized transcriptional program and subsequent massive amplification of centrioles within the cytoplasm. The E2F4 transcription factor is required for both roles and consequently for multiciliogenesis. Here we establish that E2F4 associates with two distinct components of the centriole replication machinery, Deup1 and SAS6, targeting nonhomologous domains in these proteins. We map Deup1 and SAS6 binding to E2F4's N-terminus and show that this domain is sufficient to mediate E2F4's cytoplasmic role in multiciliogenesis. This sequence is highly conserved across the E2F family, but the ability to bind Deup1 and SAS6 is specific to E2F4 and E2F5, consistent with their shared roles in multiciliogenesis. By generating E2F4/E2F1 chimeras, we identify a six-residue motif that is critical for Deup1 and SAS6 binding. We propose that the ability of E2F4 and E2F5 to recruit Deup1 and/or SAS6, and enable centriole replication, contributes to their cytoplasmic roles in multiciliogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "The impact of prematurity on human development and neonatal diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, has been widely reported. However, little is known about the effects of prematurity on the programs of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation of the upper respiratory epithelium, which is key for adaptation to neonatal life. We developed a minimally invasive methodology for isolation of neonatal basal cells from nasopharyngeal (NP) aspirates and performed functional analysis in organotypic cultures to address this issue. We show that preterm NP progenitors have a markedly distinct molecular signature of abnormal proliferation and mitochondria quality control compared to term progenitors. Preterm progenitors had lower oxygen consumption at baseline and were unable to ramp up consumption to the levels of term cells when challenged. Although they formed a mucociliary epithelium, ciliary function tended to decline in premature cells as they differentiated, compared to term cells. Together, these differences suggested increased sensitivity of preterm progenitors to environmental stressors under non-homeostatic conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) have crucial roles in airway physiology and immunity by producing bioactive amines and neuropeptides (NPs). A variety of human diseases exhibit PNEC hyperplasia. Given accumulated evidence that PNECs represent a heterogenous population of cells, we investigate how PNECs differ, whether the heterogeneity is similarly present in mouse and human cells, and whether specific disease involves discrete PNECs. Herein, we identify three distinct types of PNECs in human and mouse airways based on single and double positivity for TUBB3 and the established NP markers. We show that the three PNEC types exhibit significant differences in NP expression, homeostatic turnover, and response to injury and disease. We provide evidence that these differences parallel their distinct cell of origin from basal stem cells (BSCs) or other airway epithelial progenitors.",

        "Abstract": "The Hippo pathway has emerged as a crucial integrator of signals in biological events from development to adulthood and in diseases. Although extensively studied in Drosophila and in cell cultures, major gaps of knowledge still remain on how this pathway functions in mammalian systems. The pathway consists of a growing number of components, including core kinases and adaptor proteins, which control the subcellular localization of the transcriptional co-activators Yap and Taz through phosphorylation of serines at key sites. When localized to the nucleus, Yap/Taz interact with TEAD transcription factors to induce transcriptional programs of proliferation, stemness, and growth. In the cytoplasm, Yap/Taz interact with multiple pathways to regulate a variety of cellular functions or are targeted for degradation. The Hippo pathway receives cues from diverse intracellular and extracellular inputs, including growth factor and integrin signaling, polarity complexes, and cell-cell junctions. This review highlights the mechanisms of regulation of Yap/Taz nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and their implications for epithelial cell behavior using the lung as an intriguing example of this paradigm. This article is categorized under: Gene Expression and Transcriptional Hierarchies > Regulatory Mechanisms Signaling Pathways > Cell Fate Signaling Establishment of Spatial and Temporal Patterns > Cytoplasmic Localization.",

        "Abstract": "Balanced progenitor activities are crucial for the development and maintenance of high turn-over organs such as the esophagus. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating these progenitor activities in the esophagus remain to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that Yap is required for the proliferation of esophageal progenitor cells (EPCs) in the developing murine esophagus. We found that Yap deficiency reduces EPC proliferation and stratification whereas persistent Yap activation increases cell proliferation and causes aberrant stratification of the developing esophagus. We further demonstrated that the role of YAP signaling is conserved in the developing human esophagus by utilizing 3D human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived esophageal organoid culture. Taken together, our studies combining loss/gain-of-function murine models and hPSC differentiation support a key role for YAP in the self-renewal of EPCs and stratification of the esophageal epithelium.",

        "Abstract": "Notch signaling regulates cell fate selection during development in multiple organs including the lung. Previous studies on the role of Notch in the lung focused mostly on Notch pathway core components or receptor-specific functions. It is unclear, however, how Jagged or Delta-like ligands collectively or individually (Jag1, Jag2, Dll1, Dll4) influence differentiation of airway epithelial progenitors. Using mouse genetic models we show major differences in Jag and Dll in regulation and establishment of cell fate. Jag ligands had a major impact in balancing distinct cell populations in conducting airways, but had no role in the establishment of domains and cellular abundance in the neuroendocrine (NE) microenvironment. Surprisingly, Dll ligands were crucial in restricting cell fate and size of NE bodies and showed an overlapping role with Jag in differentiation of NE-associated secretory (club) cells. These mechanisms may potentially play a role in human conditions that result in aberrant NE differentiation, including NE hyperplasias and cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Although the Hippo-yes-associated protein (Yap) pathway has been implicated in lung development, the specific roles for Yap and its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in the developing airway and alveolar compartments remain elusive. Moreover, conflicting results from expression studies and differences in the lung phenotypes of Yap and Hippo kinase null mutants caused controversy over the dynamics and significance of Yap subcellular localization in the developing lung. Here, we show that the aberrant morphogenesis of Yap-deficient lungs results from the disruption of developmental events specifically in distal epithelial progenitors. We also show that activation of nuclear Yap is enough to fulfill the Yap requirements to rescue abnormalities in these lungs. Remarkably, we found that Yap nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is largely dispensable in epithelial progenitors for both branching morphogenesis and sacculation. However, if maintained transcriptionally active in airways, nuclear Yap profoundly alters proximal-distal identity and halts epithelial differentiation. Taken together, these observations provide novel insights into the crucial importance of Hippo-Yap signaling in the lung prenatally.",

        "Abstract": "Heparan sulfate (HS) is a complex linear polysaccharide that modulates a wide range of biological functions. Elucidating the structure-function relationship of HS has been challenging. Here we report the generation of an HS-mutant mouse lung endothelial cell library by systematic deletion of HS genes expressed in the cell. We used this library to (1) determine that the strictly defined fine structure of HS, not its overall degree of sulfation, is more important for FGF2-FGFR1 signaling; (2) define the epitope features of commonly used anti-HS phage display antibodies; and (3) delineate the fine inter-regulation networks by which HS genes modify HS and chain length in mammalian cells at a cell-type-specific level. Our mutant-cell library will allow robust and systematic interrogation of the roles and related structures of HS in a cellular context.",

        "Abstract": "Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) could provide a powerful system to model development of the human esophagus, whose distinct tissue organization compared to rodent esophagus suggests that developmental mechanisms may not be conserved between species. We therefore established an efficient protocol for generating esophageal progenitor cells (EPCs) from human PSCs. We found that inhibition of TGF-\u00df and BMP signaling is required for sequential specification of EPCs, which can be further purified using cell-surface markers. These EPCs resemble their human fetal counterparts and can recapitulate normal development of\u00a0esophageal stratified squamous epithelium during in\u00a0vitro 3D cultures and in\u00a0vivo. Importantly,\u00a0combining hPSC differentiation strategies\u00a0with mouse genetics elucidated a critical role for Notch signaling in the formation of this epithelium. These studies therefore not only provide an\u00a0efficient approach to generate EPCs, but also offer a model system to study the regulatory mechanisms underlying development of the human esophagus.",

        "Abstract": "Abnormal development of multiciliated cells is a hallmark of a variety of human conditions associated with chronic airway diseases, hydrocephalus and infertility. Multiciliogenesis requires both activation of a specialized transcriptional program and assembly of cytoplasmic structures for large-scale centriole amplification that generates basal bodies. It remains unclear, however, what mechanism initiates formation of these multiprotein complexes in epithelial progenitors. Here we show that this is triggered by nucleocytoplasmic translocation of the transcription factor E2f4. After inducing a transcriptional program of centriole biogenesis, E2f4 forms apical cytoplasmic organizing centres for assembly and nucleation of deuterosomes. Using genetically altered mice and E2F4 mutant proteins we demonstrate that centriole amplification is crucially dependent on these organizing centres and that, without cytoplasmic E2f4, deuterosomes are not assembled, halting multiciliogenesis. Thus, E2f4 integrates nuclear and previously unsuspected cytoplasmic events of centriole amplification, providing new perspectives for the understanding of normal ciliogenesis, ciliopathies and cancer.",

The identity and significance of these progenitors (variant CCs, v-CCs) have\u00a0remained elusive. A recent screen for CC markers identified rare Uroplakin3a (Upk3a)-expressing cells\u00a0(U-CCs) with a v-CC-like distribution. Here, we employ lineage analysis in the uninjured and chemically injured lungs to investigate the\u00a0role of U-CCs as epithelial progenitors. U-CCs proliferate and generate CCs and ciliated cells in uninjured airways long-term and, like v-CCs, after Nap. U-CCs have a higher propensity to generate ciliated cells than non-U-CCs. Although U-CCs do not contribute to alveolar maintenance long-term, they generate alveolar type I and type II cells after Bleomycin (Bleo)-induced alveolar injury. Finally, we report that Upk3a",

        "Abstract": "The University of Vermont College of Medicine, in collaboration with the NHLBI, Alpha-1 Foundation, American Thoracic Society, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, European Respiratory Society, International Society for Cellular Therapy, and the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation, convened a workshop, \"Stem Cells and Cell Therapies in Lung Biology and Lung Diseases,\" held July 27 to 30, 2015, at the University of Vermont. The conference objectives were to review the current understanding of the role of stem and progenitor cells in lung repair after injury and to review the current status of cell therapy and ex vivo bioengineering approaches for lung diseases. These are all rapidly expanding areas of study that both provide further insight into and challenge traditional views of mechanisms of lung repair after injury and pathogenesis of several lung diseases. The goals of the conference were to summarize the current state of the field, discuss and debate current controversies, and identify future research directions and opportunities for both basic and translational research in cell-based therapies for lung diseases. This 10th anniversary conference was a follow up to five previous biennial conferences held at the University of Vermont in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013. Each of those conferences, also sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, American Thoracic Society, and respiratory disease foundations, has been important in helping guide research and funding priorities. The major conference recommendations are summarized at the end of the report and highlight both the significant progress and major challenges in these rapidly progressing fields.",

        "Abstract": "Abnormal enlargement of the alveolar spaces is a hallmark of conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Notch signaling is crucial for differentiation and regeneration and repair of the airway epithelium. However, how Notch influences the alveolar compartment and integrates this process with airway development remains little understood. Here we report a prominent role of Notch signaling in the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that lead to alveolar formation in the developing lung. We found that alveolar type II cells are major sites of Notch2 activation and show by Notch2-specific epithelial deletion (Notch2(cNull)) a unique contribution of this receptor to alveologenesis. Epithelial Notch2 was required for type II cell induction of the PDGF-A ligand and subsequent paracrine activation of PDGF receptor-\u03b1 signaling in alveolar myofibroblast progenitors. Moreover, Notch2 was crucial in maintaining the integrity of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the distal conducting airways. Our data suggest that epithelial Notch signaling regulates multiple aspects of postnatal development in the distal lung and may represent a potential target for intervention in pulmonary diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Genomic approaches have predicted hundreds of thousands of tissue-specific cis-regulatory sequences, but the determinants critical to their function and evolutionary history are mostly unknown. Here we systematically decode a set of brain enhancers active in the zona limitans intrathalamica (zli), a signaling center essential for vertebrate forebrain development via the secreted morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh). We apply a de novo motif analysis tool to identify six position-independent sequence motifs together with their cognate transcription factors that are essential for zli enhancer activity and Shh expression in the mouse embryo. Using knowledge of this regulatory lexicon, we discover new Shh zli enhancers in mice and a functionally equivalent element in hemichordates, indicating an ancient origin of the Shh zli regulatory network that predates the chordate phylum. These findings support a strategy for delineating functionally conserved enhancers in the absence of overt sequence homologies and over extensive evolutionary distances.",

        "Abstract": "Epithelial cells undergo dynamic polarity changes as organs pattern, but the relationship between epithelial polarity and cell fate is poorly understood. Using the developing lung as a model, we found that distinct alterations in apical-basal polarity dictate airway epithelial differentiation. We demonstrate that Crb3, a Crumbs isoform that determines epithelial apical domain identity, is required for airway differentiation by controlling the localization of the transcriptional regulator Yap. We show that Crb3 promotes the interaction between Yap and the Hippo pathway kinases Lats1/2 at apical cell junctions to induce Yap phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention, which drive cell differentiation. Loss of Crb3 in developing mouse airways or isolated adult airway progenitors results in unrestricted nuclear Yap activity and consequent cell differentiation defects. Our findings demonstrate that polarity-dependent cues control airway cell differentiation, offering important molecular insights into organ patterning.",

        "Abstract": "Basal cells are multipotent airway progenitors that generate distinct epithelial cell phenotypes crucial for homeostasis and repair of the conducting airways. Little is known about how these progenitor cells expand and transition to differentiation to form the pseudostratified airway epithelium in the developing and adult lung. Here, we show by genetic and pharmacological approaches that endogenous activation of Notch3 signaling selectively controls the pool of undifferentiated progenitors of upper airways available for differentiation. This mechanism depends on the availability of Jag1 and Jag2, and is key to generating a population of parabasal cells that later activates Notch1 and Notch2 for secretory-multiciliated cell fate selection. Disruption of this mechanism resulted in aberrant expansion of basal cells and altered pseudostratification. Analysis of human lungs showing similar abnormalities and decreased NOTCH3 expression in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease suggests an involvement of NOTCH3-dependent events in the pathogenesis of this condition.",

        "Abstract": "How epithelial progenitor cells integrate local signals\u00a0to balance expansion with differentiation during organogenesis is still little understood. Here, we provide evidence that the Hippo pathway effector Yap is a key regulator of this process in the developing lung. We show that when epithelial tubules are forming and branching, a nucleocytoplasmic shift in Yap localization marks the boundary between the airway and the distal lung compartments. At this transition zone, Yap specifies a transcriptional program that controls Sox2 expression and ultimately generates the airway epithelium. Without Yap, epithelial progenitors are unable to properly respond to local TGF-\u03b2-induced cues and control levels and distribution of Sox2 to form airways. Yap levels and subcellular localization also markedly influence Sox2 expression and differentiation of adult airway progenitors. Our data reveal a role for the Hippo-Yap pathway in integrating growth-factor-induced cues in the developing and adult lung potentially key for homeostasis and regeneration repair.",

        "Abstract": "Clara cells (CCs) are a morphologically and operationally heterogeneous population of Secretoglobin Scgb1a1-expressing secretory cells that are crucial for airway homeostasis and post-injury repair. Analysis of the extent and origin of CC diversity are limited by knowledge of genes expressed in these cells and their precursors. To identify novel putative markers of CCs and explore the origins of CC diversity, we characterized global changes in gene expression in embryonic lungs in which CCs do not form due to conditional disruption of Notch signaling (Rbpjk(CNULL)). Microarray profiling, Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR), and RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) identified eleven genes downregulated in the E18.5 airways of Rbpjk(cnull) compared to controls, nearly half not previously known to mark CCs. ISH revealed that several genes had overlapping but distinct domains of expression of in the normal developing lung (E18.5). Notably, Reg3g, Chad, Gabrp and Lrrc26 were enriched in proximal airways, Hp in the distal airways and Upk3a in clusters of cells surrounding Neuroepithelial Bodies (NEBs). Seven of the eleven genes, including Reg3g, Hp, and Upk3a, were expressed in the adult lung in CCs in a pattern similar to that observed in the developing airways. qRT-PCR-based analysis of gene expression of CCs isolated from different airway regions of B1-EGFP reporter mice corroborated the spatial enrichment in gene expression observed by ISH. Our study identifies candidate markers for CC-precursors and CCs and supports the idea that the diversification of the CC phenotype occurs already during embryonic development.",

        "Abstract": "There is increasing evidence that vitamin A deficiency in utero correlates with abnormal airway smooth muscle (SM) function in postnatal life. The bioactive vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) is essential for formation of the lung primordium; however, little is known about the impact of early fetal RA deficiency on postnatal lung structure and function. Here, we provide evidence that during murine lung development, endogenous RA has a key role in restricting the airway SM differentiation program during airway formation. Using murine models of pharmacological, genetic, and dietary vitamin A/RA deficiency, we found that disruption of RA signaling during embryonic development consistently resulted in an altered airway SM phenotype with markedly increased expression of SM markers. The aberrant phenotype persisted postnatally regardless of the adult vitamin A status and manifested as structural changes in the bronchial SM and hyperresponsiveness of the airway without evidence of inflammation. Our data reveal a role for endogenous RA signaling in restricting SM differentiation and preventing precocious and excessive SM differentiation when airways are forming.",

        "Abstract": "Development of the pulmonary system is essential for terrestrial life. The molecular pathways that regulate this complex process are beginning to be defined, and such knowledge is critical to our understanding of congenital and acquired lung diseases. A recent workshop was convened by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to discuss the developmental principles that regulate the formation of the pulmonary system. Emerging evidence suggests that key developmental pathways not only regulate proper formation of the pulmonary system but are also reactivated upon postnatal injury and repair and in the pathogenesis of human lung diseases. Molecular understanding of early lung development has also led to new advances in areas such as generation of lung epithelium from pluripotent stem cells. The workshop was organized into four different topics, including early lung cell fate and morphogenesis, mechanisms of lung cell differentiation, tissue interactions in lung development, and environmental impact on early lung development. Critical points were raised, including the importance of epigenetic regulation of lung gene expression, the dearth of knowledge on important mesenchymal lineages within the lung, and the interaction between the developing pulmonary and cardiovascular system. This manuscript describes the summary of the discussion along with general recommendations to overcome the gaps in knowledge in lung developmental biology.",

        "Abstract": "Clara cells of mammalian airways have multiple functions and are morphologically heterogeneous. Although Notch signaling is essential for the development of these cells, it is unclear how Notch influences Clara cell specification and if diversity is established among Clara cell precursors. Here we identify expression of the secretoglobin Scgb3a2 and Notch activation as early events in a program of secretory cell fate determination in developing murine airways. We show that Scgb3a2 expression in vivo is Notch-dependent at early stages and ectopically induced by constitutive Notch1 activation, and also that in vitro Notch signaling together with the pan-airway transcription factor Ttf1 (Nkx2.1) synergistically regulate secretoglobin gene transcription. Furthermore, we identified a subpopulation of secretory precursors juxtaposed to presumptive neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs), distinguished by their strong Scgb3a2 and uroplakin 3a (Upk3a) signals and reduced Ccsp (Scgb1a1) expression. Genetic ablation of Ascl1 prevented NEB formation and selectively interfered with the formation of this subpopulation of cells. Lineage labeling of Upk3a-expressing cells during development showed that these cells remain largely uncommitted during embryonic development and contribute to Clara and ciliated cells in the adult lung. Together, our findings suggest a role for Notch in the induction of a Clara cell-specific program of gene expression, and reveals that the NEB microenvironment in the developing airways is a niche for a distinct subset of Clara-like precursors.",

        "Title": "Cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein deviates myofibroblast fas-induced apoptosis toward proliferation during lung fibrosis.",
        "Abstract": "A prominent feature of fibrotic tissue in general and of lungs in particular is fibroblast proliferation and accumulation. In patients overcoming fibrosis, apoptosis limits this excessive cell growth. We have previously shown resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis of primary lung fibroblasts from mice with bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, their escape from immune surveillance, and continued accumulation in spite of overexpression of the Fas death receptor. Cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) is a regulator of cell death receptor-induced apoptosis in many cell types. We aimed to determine c-FLIP levels in myofibroblasts from fibrotic lungs and to directly assess c-FLIP's role in apoptosis and proliferation of primary lung myofibroblasts. c-FLIP levels were determined by apoptosis gene array, flow cytometry, Western blot, and immunofluorescence before and after down-regulation with a specific small interfering RNA. Apoptosis was assessed by caspase cleavage in Western blot and by Annexin V affinity labeling after FACS and tissue immunofluorescence. Proliferation was assessed by BrdU uptake, also using FACS and immunofluorescence. We show that myofibroblasts from lungs of humans with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and from bleomycin-treated versus normal saline-treated mice up-regulate c-FLIP levels. Using the animal model, we show that fibrotic lung myofibroblasts divert Fas signaling from apoptosis to proliferation and that this requires signaling by TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) and NF-\u03baB. c-FLIP down-regulation reverses the effect of Fas activation, causing increased apoptosis, decreased proliferation, and diminished recruitment of TRAF to the DISC complex. This indicates that c-FLIP is essential for myofibroblast accumulation and may serve as a potential target to manipulate tissue fibrosis.",

        "Abstract": "Tnrc6 family members (Tnrc6a/b/c) are key components of the RNA-induced silencing complex in microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene suppression. Here, we show that Tnrc6a, also known as GW182, is selectively expressed in the yolk sac endoderm and that gene trap disruption of GW182 leads to growth arrest and apoptosis. We found that targets of miRNAs highly expressed in the yolk sac are significantly derepressed in GW182(gt/gt) mutant mice, although levels of miRNAs are not altered. Specifically, growth arrest and apoptosis phenotype are associated with significant derepression of Cdkn1a (p21), Cdkn1c (P27), Lats1, Lats2, Rb1, Rbl, Bim, and Pten, known targets of miRNAs from miR-17/20/93/106 clusters highly expressed in yolk sac endoderm. Together, these data strongly suggest that GW182 is an essential functional component in the RNA-induced silencing complex for miRNA-mediated gene silencing in vivo, and selectively regulation of miRNA activity plays an important role in the proper development of yolk sac.",

        "Abstract": "Goblet cell metaplasia and mucus overproduction contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Notch signaling regulates cell fate decisions and is crucial in controlling goblet cell differentiation in the gut epithelium. Little is known, however, about how endogenous Notch signaling influences the goblet cell differentiation program that takes place in the postnatal lung. Using a combination of genetic and in vitro approaches here we provide evidence of a novel role for Notch in restricting goblet cell differentiation in the airway epithelium during the postnatal period. Conditional inactivation of the essential Notch pathway component Pofut1 (protein O-fucosyltransferase1) in Tgfb3-Cre-expressing mice resulted in an aberrant postnatal airway phenotype characterized by marked goblet cell metaplasia, decreased Clara cell number and increase in ciliated cells. The presence of the same phenotype in mice in which the Notch transcriptional effector Rbpjk was deleted indicated the involvement of the canonical Notch pathway. Lineage study in vivo suggested that goblet cells originated from a subpopulation of Clara cells largely present in proximal airways in which Notch was disrupted. The phenotype was confirmed by a panel of goblet cell markers, showed no changes in cell proliferation or altered expression of proinflammatory cytokines and was associated with significant downregulation of the bHLH transcriptional repressor Hes5. Luciferase reporter analysis suggested that Notch directly repressed MUC5AC transcription in lung epithelial cells. The data suggested that during postnatal life Notch is required to prevent Clara cells from differentiating into goblet cells.",

        "Title": "Lacrimal gland development and Fgf10-Fgfr2b signaling are controlled by 2-O- and 6-O-sulfated heparan sulfate.",
        "Abstract": "Heparan sulfate, an extensively sulfated glycosaminoglycan abundant on cell surface proteoglycans, regulates intercellular signaling through its binding to various growth factors and receptors. In the lacrimal gland, branching morphogenesis depends on the interaction of heparan sulfate with Fgf10-Fgfr2b. To address if lacrimal gland development and FGF signaling depends on 2-O-sulfation of uronic acids and 6-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues, we genetically ablated heparan sulfate 2-O and 6-O sulfotransferases (Hs2st, Hs6st1, and Hs6st2) in developing lacrimal gland. Using a panel of phage display antibodies, we confirmed that these mutations disrupted 2-O and/or 6-O but not N-sulfation of heparan sulfate. The Hs6st mutants exhibited significant lacrimal gland hypoplasia and a strong genetic interaction with Fgf10, demonstrating the importance of heparan sulfate 6-O sulfation in lacrimal gland FGF signaling. Altering Hs2st caused a much less severe phenotype, but the Hs2st;Hs6st double mutants completely abolished lacrimal gland development, suggesting that both 2-O and 6-O sulfation of heparan sulfate contribute to FGF signaling. Combined Hs2st;Hs6st deficiency synergistically disrupted the formation of Fgf10-Fgfr2b-heparan sulfate complex on the cell surface and prevented lacrimal gland induction by Fgf10 in explant cultures. Importantly, the Hs2st;Hs6st double mutants abrogated FGF downstream ERK signaling. Therefore, Fgf10-Fgfr2b signaling during lacrimal gland development is sensitive to the content or arrangement of O-sulfate groups in heparan sulfate. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that simultaneous deletion of Hs2st and Hs6st exhibits profound FGF signaling defects in mammalian development.",

        "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small regulatory RNAs that control gene expression by translational suppression and destabilization of target mRNAs. There is increasing evidence that miRNAs regulate genes associated with fibrosis in organs, such as the heart, kidney, liver, and the lung. In a large-scale screening for miRNAs potentially involved in bleomycin-induced fibrosis, we found expression of miR-29 family members significantly reduced in fibrotic lungs. Analysis of normal lungs showed the presence of miR-29 in subsets of interstitial cells of the alveolar wall, pleura, and at the entrance of the alveolar duct, known sites of pulmonary fibrosis. miR-29 levels inversely correlated with the expression levels of profibrotic target genes and the severity of the fibrosis. To study the impact of miR-29 down-regulation in the lung interstitium, we characterized gene expression profiles of human fetal lung fibroblast IMR-90 cells in which endogenous miR-29 was knocked down. This confirmed the derepression of reported miR-29 targets, including several collagens, but also revealed up-regulation of a large number of previously unrecognized extracellular matrix-associated and remodeling genes. Moreover, we found that miR-29 is suppressed by transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 in these cells, and that many fibrosis-associated genes up-regulated by TGF-\u03b21 are derepressed by miR-29 knockdown. Interestingly, a comparison of TGF-\u03b21 and miR-29 targets revealed that miR-29 controls an additional subset of fibrosis-related genes, including laminins and integrins, independent of TGF-\u03b21. Together, these strongly suggest a role of miR-29 in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. miR-29 may be a potential new therapeutic target for this disease.",

        "Abstract": "The developmental abnormalities associated with disruption of signaling by retinoic acid (RA), the biologically active form of vitamin A, have been known for decades from studies in animal models and humans. These include defects in the respiratory system, such as lung hypoplasia and agenesis. However, the molecular events controlled by RA that lead to formation of the lung primordium from the primitive foregut remain unclear. Here, we present evidence that endogenous RA acts as a major regulatory signal integrating Wnt and Tgfbeta pathways in the control of Fgf10 expression during induction of the mouse primordial lung. We demonstrated that activation of Wnt signaling required for lung formation was dependent on local repression of its antagonist, Dickkopf homolog 1 (Dkk1), by endogenous RA. Moreover, we showed that simultaneously activating Wnt and repressing Tgfbeta allowed induction of both lung buds in RA-deficient foreguts. The data in this study suggest that disruption of Wnt/Tgfbeta/Fgf10 interactions represents the molecular basis for the classically reported failure to form lung buds in vitamin A deficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Reduced expression of miR-129 has been reported in multiple tumor cell lines and in primary tumors including medulloblastoma, undifferentiated gastric cancers, lung adenocarcinoma, endometrial cancer and colorectal carcinoma. There is also recent evidence of an anti-proliferative activity of miR-129 in tumor cell lines. Still, little is known about how miR-129 regulates cell proliferation. Here we found that lentiviral-mediated overexpression of miR-129 in mouse lung epithelial cells (E10 cells) results in significant G(1) phase arrest that eventually leads to cell death. miR-129 induce G(1) phase arrest in multiple human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, suggesting miR-129 targeting of G(1)/S phase-specific regulators. Interestingly, we show that Cdk6, a kinase involved in G(1)-S transition, is a direct target of miR-129. We also found the downregulation of three other cell cycle-related novel targets of miR-129, including Erk1, Erk2 and protein kinase C epsilon (Prkce). We further show that among these targets, only Cdk6 is functionally relevant. Restoring expression of Cdk6, but not Prkce partially rescues the cell growth arrest and cell death phenotype that results from miR-129 overexpression. Together, our data indicate that miR-129 plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation by downregulation of Cdk6.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) results in major remodeling of the distal airspaces and changes in the differentiation profile of the airway epithelium. The cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in initiation and progression of this disease are little understood. Although environmental factors, including cigarette smoke, have been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD, genetic risk factors also appear to play a fundamental role in the individual's susceptibility to this disease. Lung development depends on precise coordination of signals, such as fibroblast growth factors (Fgf), Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), retinoic acid, Notch, and Tgf beta. Dramatic changes in the pattern of branching and differentiation of the lung epithelium results from disruption of these signals in genetically altered mice. Recent studies, including whole-genome expression and genome-wide association analyses, suggest that some molecular regulators originally described in developmental processes may be altered in patients with COPD. Whether disturbances in the molecular and cellular events mediated by these genes during development participate in the initiation or exacerbation of COPD, needs further investigation. The role of selected pathways, including Sonic hedgehog, Notch, retinoid, and Tgf beta in the developing lung and the potential association with COPD are discussed.",

        "Title": "Heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase is required for triglyceride-rich lipoprotein clearance.",
        "Abstract": "Hepatic clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins depends on heparan sulfate and low density lipoprotein receptors expressed on the basal membrane of hepatocytes. Binding and uptake of the lipoproteins by way of heparan sulfate depends on the degree of sulfation of the chains based on accumulation of plasma triglycerides and delayed clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in mice bearing a hepatocyte-specific alteration of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) N-deacetylase-N-sulfotransferase 1 (Ndst1) (MacArthur, J. M., Bishop, J. R., Stanford, K. I., Wang, L., Bensadoun, A., Witztum, J. L., and Esko, J. D. (2007) J. Clin. Invest. 117, 153-164). Inactivation of Ndst1 led to decreased overall sulfation of heparan sulfate due to coupling of uronyl 2-O-sulfation and glucosaminyl 6-O-sulfation to initial N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of GlcNAc residues. To determine whether lipoprotein clearance depends on 2-O-and 6-O-sulfation, we evaluated plasma triglyceride levels in mice containing loxP-flanked conditional alleles of uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase (Hs2st(f/f)) and glucosaminyl 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 (Hs6st1(f/f)) and the bacterial Cre recombinase expressed in hepatocytes from the rat albumin (Alb) promoter. We show that Hs2st(f/f)AlbCre(+) mice accumulated plasma triglycerides and exhibited delayed clearance of intestinally derived chylomicrons and injected human very low density lipoproteins to the same extent as observed in Ndst1(f/f)AlbCre(+) mice. In contrast, Hs6st1(f/f)AlbCre(+) mice did not exhibit any changes in plasma triglycerides. Chemically modified heparins lacking N-sulfate and 2-O-sulfate groups did not block very low density lipoprotein binding and uptake in isolated hepatocytes, whereas heparin lacking 6-O-sulfate groups was as active as unaltered heparin. Our findings show that plasma lipoprotein clearance depends on specific subclasses of sulfate groups and not on overall charge of the chains.",

        "Abstract": "In mammals, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is synthesized predominately in the small intestine and functions in conjunction with insulin to promote nutrient deposition. However, little is known regarding GIP expression and function in early vertebrates like the zebrafish, a model organism representing an early stage in the evolutionary development of the compound vertebrate pancreas. Analysis of GIP and insulin (insa) expression in zebrafish larvae by RT-PCR demonstrated that although insa was detected as early as 24 h postfertilization (hpf), GIP expression was not demonstrated until 72 hpf, shortly after the completion of endocrine pancreatic development but prior to the commencement of independent feeding. Furthermore, whole mount in situ hybridization of zebrafish larvae showed expression of GIP and insa in the same tissues, and in adult zebrafish, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry demonstrated GIP expression in both the intestine and the pancreas. Receptor activation studies showed that zebrafish GIP was capable of activating the rat GIP receptor. Although previous studies have identified four receptors with glucagon receptor-like sequences in the zebrafish, one of which possesses the capacity to bind GIP, a functional analysis of these receptors has not been performed. This study demonstrates interactions between the latter receptor and zebrafish GIP, identifying it as a potential in vivo target for the ligand. Finally, food deprivation studies in larvae demonstrated an increase in GIP and proglucagon II mRNA levels in response to fasting. In conclusion, the results of these studies suggest that although the zebrafish appears to be a model of an early stage of evolutionary development of GIP expression, the peptide may not possess incretin properties in this species.",

        "Abstract": "Although there is accumulated evidence of a role for Notch in the developing lung, it is still unclear how disruption of Notch signaling affects lung progenitor cell fate and differentiation events in the airway epithelium. To address this issue, we inactivated Notch signaling conditionally in the endoderm using a Shh-Cre deleter mouse line and mice carrying floxed alleles of the Pofut1 gene, which encodes an O-fucosyltransferase essential for Notch-ligand binding. We also took the same conditional approach to inactivate expression of Rbpjk, which encodes the transcriptional effector of canonical Notch signaling. Strikingly, these mutants showed an almost identical lung phenotype characterized by an absence of secretory Clara cells without evidence of cell death, and showed airways populated essentially by ciliated cells, with an increase in neuroendocrine cells. This phenotype could be further replicated in cultured wild-type lungs by disrupting Notch signaling with a gamma-secretase inhibitor. Our data suggest that Notch acts when commitment to a ciliated or non-ciliated cell fate occurs in proximal progenitors, silencing the ciliated program in the cells that will continue to expand and differentiate into secretory cells. This mechanism may be crucial to define the balance of differentiated cell profiles in different generations of the developing airways. It might also be relevant to mediate the metaplastic changes in the respiratory epithelium that occur in pathological conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

        "Abstract": "Cyld encodes a 956-amino acid deubiquitinating enzyme (CYLD), which is a negative regulator of nuclear factor kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Mutations that truncate and inactivate the carboxyl-terminal deubiquitinating domain of CYLD underlie the development of skin appendage tumors in humans, whereas down-regulation of Cyld expression has been associated with the development of various types of human malignancies including lung cancer. To establish an animal model of human CYLD inactivation and characterize the biological role of CYLD in vivo, we generated mice carrying a homozygous deletion of Cyld exon 9 (Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) mice) using a conditional approach. Deletion of exon 9 would cause a carboxyl-terminal truncation of CYLD and inactivation of its deubiquitinating activity. In accordance with previous studies, fibroblasts from Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) embryos had hyperactive nuclear factor kappaB and c-Jun kinase pathways compared with control fibroblasts. Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) newborn mice were smaller than wild-type littermates with a short and kinky tail and no major developmental defects. However, Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) mice died shortly after birth from apparent respiratory dysfunction. Histological examination of E18.5 Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) lungs demonstrated an immature phenotype characterized by hyperplasic mesenchyme but apparently normal epithelial, smooth muscle. and endothelial structures. Our study identifies an important role of CYLD in lung maturation, which may underlie the development of many cases of lung cancer.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of the workshop was to identify still obscure or novel cellular components of the lung, to determine cell function in lung development and in health that impacts on disease, and to decide promising avenues for future research to extract and phenotype these cells. Since robust technologies are now available to identify, sort, purify, culture, and phenotype cells, progress is now within sight to unravel the origins and functional capabilities of lung cells in developmental stages and in disease. The Workshop's agenda was to first discuss the lung's embryologic development, including progenitor and stem cells, and then assess the functional and structural cells in three main compartments of the lung: (1) airway cells in bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium and bronchial glands (basal, secretory, ciliated, Clara, and neuroendocrine cells); (2) alveolar unit cells (Type 1 cells, Type 2 cells, and fibroblasts in the interstitium); and (3) pulmonary vascular cells (endothelial cells from different vascular structures, smooth muscle cells, and adventitial fibroblasts). The main recommendations were to: (1) characterize with better cell markers, both surface and nonsurface, the various cells within the lung, including progenitor cells and stem cells; (2) obtain more knowledge about gene expression in specific cell types in health and disease, which will provide insights into biological and pathologic processes; (3) develop more methodologies for cell culture, isolation, sorting, co-culture, and immortalization; and (4) promote tissue banks to facilitate the procurement of tissue from normal and from diseased lung for analysis at all levels.",

        "Abstract": "Little is known about the mechanisms by which the lung epithelial progenitors are initially patterned and how proximal-distal boundaries are established and maintained when the lung primordium forms and starts to branch. Here we identified a number of Notch pathway components in respiratory progenitors of the early lung, and we investigated the role of Notch in lung pattern formation. By preventing gamma-secretase cleavage of Notch receptors, we have disrupted global Notch signaling in the foregut and in the lung during the initial stages of murine lung morphogenesis. We demonstrate that Notch signaling is not necessary for lung bud initiation; however, Notch is required to maintain a balance of proximal-distal cell fates at these early stages. Disruption of Notch signaling dramatically expands the population of distal progenitors, altering morphogenetic boundaries and preventing formation of proximal structures. Our data suggest a novel mechanism in which Notch and fibroblast growth factor signaling interact to control the proximal-distal pattern of forming airways in the mammalian lung.",

        "Abstract": "Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans modulate the biological activity of a number of growth factors in development, homeostasis, and cancer. Specific modifications of HS chains by HS biosynthetic enzymes have been implicated in growth factor signaling in multiple aspects of organogenesis. Although the role of HS 6-O-sulfotransferases has been described in processes such as trachea formation in Drosophila and vasculogenesis in zebrafish, little is known about how HS 6-O-sulfotransferases (Hs6st1-3 in mice) influence mouse development. To address this issue, we generated a conditionally mutant Hs6st1 mouse line and then generated mice with systemic inactivation of Hs6st1. Hs6st1-null pups were viable and grossly normal at birth. The lack of obvious abnormalities in lung, liver, and kidney, which express high levels of Hs6st1 during development, suggests that at least during embryonic life, the loss of Hs6st1 function may be compensated for by mechanisms involving other HS modifying enzymes. During early adulthood, however, Hs6st1-null mice failed to thrive and exhibited growth retardation, body weight loss, enlargement of airspaces in the lung and, in some cases, lethality. Our results suggest a potentially critical role for HS 6-O sulfation by Hs6st1 in postnatal processes.",

        "Abstract": "Fgf10 has a prominent role in organogenesis. In the developing lung, Fgf10 is dynamically expressed in the distal mesenchyme from where it diffuses and activates its epithelial receptor, Fgfr2b, to trigger budding. Little is known about how Fgf10 expression is regulated. Here we have identified a mouse lung-specific mesenchymal cell line, MLg, which expresses endogenous Fgf10 and responds to known regulators of Fgf10 in a way that is reminiscent of the early lung. To gain insights into the mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of Fgf10 in these cells, we have cloned and analyzed approximately a 4.5 kb region of the mouse Fgf10 promoter. Promoter deletion analysis and Luciferase reporter assays revealed an upstream region of the Fgf10 promoter with selective enhancer activity in the MLg, but not in the non-lung-derived cell line NIH3T3. Our data suggest that a potential lung mesenchyme-specific enhancer may exist within this region of the Fgf10 promoter.",

        "Abstract": "Secreted modular calcium-binding protein-2 (SMOC-2) is a recently-identified SPARC-related protein of unknown function. In mRNA profiling experiments we, found that SMOC-2 expression was elevated in quiescent (G0) mouse fibroblasts and repressed after mitogenic stimulation with serum. The G0-specific expression of SMOC-2 was similar to that of platelet-derived growth factor-beta receptor (PDGFbetaR), a major mitogenic receptor. Therefore, we tested a possible role for SMOC-2 in growth factor-induced cell cycle progression. SMOC-2 overexpression augmented DNA synthesis induced by serum and fibroblast mitogens (including PDGF-BB and basic fibroblast growth factor). Conversely, SMOC-2 ablation by using small interfering RNA attenuated DNA synthesis in response to PDGF-BB and other growth factors. Mitogen-induced expression of cyclin D1 was attenuated in SMOC-2-ablated cells, and cyclin D1-overexpressing cells were resistant to inhibition of mitogenesis after SMOC-2 ablation. Therefore, cyclin D1 is limiting for G1 progression in SMOC-2-deficient cells. SMOC-2 ablation did not inhibit PDGF-induced PDGFbetaR autophosphorylation or PDGF-BB-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt kinases, suggesting that SMOC-2 is dispensable for growth factor receptor activation. However, integrin-linked kinase (ILK) activity was reduced in SMOC-2-ablated cells. Ectopic expression of hyperactive ILK corrected the defective mitogenic response of SMOC-2-deficient cells. Therefore, SMOC-2 contributes to cell cycle progression by maintaining ILK activity during G1. These results identify a novel role for SMOC-2 in cell cycle control.",

        "Title": "Inhibition of Tgf beta signaling by endogenous retinoic acid is essential for primary lung bud induction.",
        "Abstract": "Disruption of retinoic acid (RA) signaling during early development results in severe respiratory tract abnormalities, including lung agenesis. Previous studies suggest that this might result from failure to selectively induce fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) in the prospective lung region of the foregut. Little is known about the RA-dependent pathways present in the foregut that may be crucial for lung formation. By performing global gene expression analysis of RA-deficient foreguts from a genetic [retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh2)-null] and a pharmacological (BMS493-treated) mouse model, we found upregulation of a large number of Tgfbeta targets. Increased Smad2 phosphorylation further suggested that Tgfbeta signaling was hyperactive in these foreguts when lung agenesis was observed. RA rescue of the lung phenotype was associated with low levels of Smad2 phosphorylation and downregulation of Tgfbeta targets in Raldh2-null foreguts. Interestingly, the lung defect that resulted from RA-deficiency could be reproduced in RA-sufficient foreguts by hyperactivating Tgfbeta signaling with exogenous TGF beta 1. Preventing activation of endogenous Tgfbeta signaling with a pan-specific TGFbeta-blocking antibody allowed bud formation and gene expression in the lung field of both Raldh2-null and BMS493-treated foreguts. Our data support a novel mechanism of RA-Tgfbeta-Fgf10 interactions in the developing foregut, in which endogenous RA controls Tgfbeta activity in the prospective lung field to allow local expression of Fgf10 and induction of lung buds.",

        "Title": "Cathespin H is an Fgf10 target involved in Bmp4 degradation during lung branching morphogenesis.",
        "Abstract": "During lung development, signaling by Fgf10 (fibroblast growth factor 10) and its receptor Fgfr2b is critical for induction of a gene network that controls proliferation, differentiation, and branching of the epithelial tubules. The downstream events triggered by Fgf10-Fgfr2b signaling during this process are still poorly understood. In a global screen for transcriptional targets of Fgf10, we identified Ctsh (cathepsin H), a gene encoding a lysosomal cysteine protease of the papain family, highly up-regulated in the developing lung epithelium. Here we show that among other cathepsin genes present in the lung, Ctsh is the only family member selectively induced by Fgf10 in the lung epithelium. We provide evidence that, during branching morphogenesis, epithelial expression of Ctsh overlaps temporally and spatially with that of Bmp4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4), another target of Fgf10. Moreover, we show that Ctsh controls the availability of mature Bmp4 protein in the embryonic lung and that inhibiting Ctsh activity leads to a marked accumulation of Bmp4 protein and disruption of branching morphogenesis. Tightly controlled levels of Bmp4 signaling are critical for patterning of the distal lung epithelium. Our study suggests a potentially novel posttranscriptional mechanism in which Ctsh rapidly removes Bmp4 from forming buds to limit Bmp4 action. The presence of both Ctsh and Bmp4 or Bmp4 signaling activity in other developing structures, such as the kidney, yolk sac, and choroid plexus, suggests a possible general role of Ctsh in regulating Bmp4 proteolysis in different morphogenetic events.",

        "Abstract": "Retinoic acid (RA) is an embryonic signaling molecule regulating a wide array of target genes, thereby being a master regulator of patterning and differentiation in a variety of organs. Here we show that mouse embryos deficient for the RA-synthesizing enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2), if rescued from early lethality by maternal RA supplementation between E7.5 and E8.5, lack active RA signaling in the foregut region. The resulting mutants completely fail to develop lungs. Development of more posterior foregut derivatives (stomach and duodenum), as well as liver growth, is also severely affected. A primary lung bud is specified in the RA-deficient embryos, which fails to outgrow due to defective FGF10 signaling and lack of activation of FGF-target genes, such as Pea3 and Bmp4 in the epithelium. Specific Hox and Tbx genes may mediate these RA regulatory effects. Development of foregut derivatives can be partly restored in mutants by extending the RA supplementation until at least E10.5, but lung growth and branching remain defective and a hypoplastic lung develops on the right side only. Such conditions poorly restore FGF10 signaling in the lung buds. Explant culture of RALDH2-deficient foreguts show a capacity to undergo lung budding and early branching in the presence of RA or FGF10. Our data implicate RA as a regulator of gene expression in the early embryonic lung and stomach region upstream of Hox, Tbx and FGF10 signaling.",

        "Abstract": "Retinoic acid (RA) signaling is required for normal development of multiple organs. However, little is known about how RA influences the initial stages of lung development. Here, we used a combination of genetic, pharmacological and explant culture approaches to address this issue, and to investigate how signaling by different RA receptors (RAR) mediates the RA effects. We analyzed initiation of lung development in retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (Raldh2) null mice, a model in which RA signaling is absent from the foregut from its earliest developmental stages. We provide evidence that RA is dispensable for specification of lung cell fate in the endoderm. By using synthetic retinoids to selectively activate RAR alpha or beta signaling in this model, we demonstrate novel and unique functions of these receptors in the early lung. We show that activation of RAR beta, but not alpha, induces expression of the fibroblast growth factor Fgf10 and bud morphogenesis in the lung field. Similar analysis of wild type foregut shows that endogenous RAR alpha activity is required to maintain overall RA signaling, and to refine the RAR beta effects in the lung field. Our data support the idea that balanced activation of RAR alpha and beta is critical for proper lung bud initiation and endodermal differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene silencing has recently emerged as a major mechanism of gene expression regulation during development in a variety of species. Little is known, however, about the presence of components of miRNA machinery in mammalian organogenesis. In this study, we report that members of the Argonaute (Ago) gene family are expressed in restricted of the day 11.5 and 14.5 embryo, including the brain, neural tube, limb, lungs, and hair follicles. In the developing lung, we found expression of Ago1 and Ago2 localized to branching regions, in distal epithelium and mesenchyme, respectively. These were sites undergoing the most dynamic changes in gene expression and rapid remodeling. We show that Ago1 transcripts are enriched in neural structures at these stages, consistent with the reported role of Drosophila Ago1 in the development of the central nervous system. Our results suggest a role for miRNAs in organogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Genetic studies implicate Fgf10-Fgfr2 signaling as a critical regulator of bud morphogenesis in the embryo. However, little is known about the transcriptional targets of Fgf10 during this process. Here we identified global changes in gene expression in lung epithelial explants undergoing FGF10-mediated budding in the absence of other growth factors and mesenchyme. Targets were confirmed by their localization at sites where endogenous Fgf10 signaling is active in embryonic lungs and by demonstrating their induction in intact lungs in response to local application of FGF10 protein. We show that the initial stages of budding are characterized by marked up-regulation of genes associated with cell rearrangement and cell migration, inflammatory process, and lipid metabolism but not cell proliferation. We also found that some genes implicated in tumor invasion and metastatic behavior are epithelial targets of Fgf10 in the lung and other developing organs that depend on Fgf10-Fgfr2 signaling to properly form. Our approach identifies Fgf10 targets that are common to multiple biological processes and provides insights into potential mechanisms by which Fgf signaling regulates epithelial cell behavior.",

        "Abstract": "Heparan sulfate (HS) interactions with secreted morphogens such as fibroblast growth factors, hedgehogs, and Wnts are essential for embryonic development. Formation of biologically relevant HS structures is a result of the coordinated action of various biosynthetic enzymes. HS 6-O-sulfotransferases (6OST) catalyze the transfer of sulfate groups to the 6-O position of glucosamine residues in HS. Three 6OST isoforms have been described in the mouse; however, little is known about their role in generating specific HS protein-binding sequences, expression pattern, and function in vivo. To gain insights into the distribution of these isoforms and their potential role in development, we mapped 6OST1-3 gene expression during mouse organogenesis. We report dynamic expression of these isoforms with striking differences in tissue distribution in many developing organs. We show that 6OST transcripts are differentially expressed in several sites where heparin-binding growth factors are critical for development. 6OST1 is predominantly transcribed in epithelial and neural-derived tissues, whereas 6OST2 is more mesenchymal. 6OST3 appears at later stages and in a more restricted manner. The patterns reported here strongly suggest that the HS structures modified by these enzymes have different roles in growth factor-induced developmental processes.",

        "Abstract": "During development, the proximal and distal regions of respiratory tract undergo distinct processes that ultimately give rise to conducting airways and alveoli. To gain insights into the genetic pathways differentially activated in these regions when branching morphogenesis is initiating, we characterized their transcriptional profiles in murine rudiments isolated at embryonic (E) day 11.5. By using oligonucleotide microarrays, we identified 83 and 128 genes preferentially expressed in branching and non-branching regions, respectively. The majority of these genes (85%) had not been previously described in the lung, or in other organs. We report restricted expression patterns of 22 of these genes were by in situ hybridization. Among them in the lung potential components of the Wnt, TGF beta, FGF and retinoid pathways identified in other systems, and uncharacterized genes, such as translocases, small GTPases and splicing factors. In addition, we provide a more detailed analysis of the expression pattern and regulation of a representative gene from the distal (transforming growth factor, beta induced) and proximal (WW domain-containing protein 2) regions. Our data suggest that these genes may regulate focal developmental events specific of each of these regions during respiratory tract formation.",

        "Abstract": "Although respiratory tract defects that result from disruption of retinoic acid (RA) signaling have been widely reported, the mechanism by which endogenous RA regulates early lung morphogenesis is unknown. Here, we provide novel evidence that a major role for RA is to selectively maintain mesodermal proliferation and induce fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) expression in the foregut region where the lung forms. By using a pan-RAR antagonist (BMS493) in foregut explant cultures, we show that bud initiation is selectively blocked in the prospective respiratory region by failure to induce Fgf10 in the corresponding mesoderm. The RA regulation of Fgf10 expression occurs only in this region, within a defined developmental window, and is not seen in other foregut derivatives such as thyroid and pancreas where Fgf10 is also required for normal development. Furthermore, we show that RA activity is essential in the lung field to maintain lung cell identity in the endoderm; RAR antagonism disrupts expression of thyroid transcription factor 1 (Ttf1), an early marker of the respiratory region in the endoderm, and surfactant protein C (Sp-C) mRNAs. Our observations in mouse foregut cultures are corroborated by data from an in vivo model of vitamin A deficiency in rats. Our study supports RA as an essential regulator of gene expression and cellular activities during primary bud formation.",

        "Abstract": "5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) and its downstream leukotriene products have been implicated in the development of pulmonary hypertension. In this study, we examined the effects of 5-LO overexpression in rat lungs on pulmonary hypertension using a recombinant adenovirus expressing 5-LO (Ad5-LO). Transthoracic echocardiography and right heart catheterization data showed that 5-LO overexpression in the lung did not cause pulmonary hypertension in normal rats; however, it markedly accelerated the progression of pulmonary hypertension in rats treated with monocrotaline (MCT). An increase in pulmonary artery pressure occurred earlier in the rats treated with MCT + Ad5-LO (7-10 days) compared with those treated with control vector, MCT + adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (AdGFP), or MCT alone (15-18 days). The weight ratio of the right ventricle to left ventricle plus septum was higher in the MCT + Ad5-LO group than that of the MCT + AdGFP or MCT group (0.45 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.03 or 0.33 +/- 0.06). Lung tissue histological sections from MCT + Ad5-LO rats exhibited more severe inflammatory cell infiltration and pulmonary vascular muscularization than those from MCT + AdGFP- or MCT-treated rats. Administration of 5-LO inhibitors, zileuton or MK-886, to either MCT- or MCT + Ad5-LO-treated rats prevented the development of pulmonary hypertension. These data suggest that 5-LO plays a critical role in the progression of pulmonary hypertension in rats and that the detrimental effect of 5-LO is manifest only in the setting of pulmonary vascular endothelial cell dysfunction.",

We describe two phases of AP signalling by RA, reflected in RALDH2 expression. The first phase (HH4-7) is characterized by increasing proximity between sino-atrial precursors and the lateral mesoderm expressing RALDH2. In this phase, RA signalling is consistent with diffusion of the morphogen from a large field rather than a single hot spot. The second phase (HH7-8) is characterized by progressive encircling of cardiac precursors by a field of RALDH2 originating from a dynamic and evolutionary-conserved caudorostral wave pattern in the lateral mesoderm. At this phase, cardiac AP patterning by RA is consistent with localized action of RA by regulated activation of the Raldh2 gene within an embryonic domain. Systemic treatment with BMS493 altered the cardiac fate map such that ventricular precursors were found in areas normally devoid of them. Topical application of BMS493 inhibited atrial differentiation in left anterior lateral mesoderm. Identification of the caudorostral wave of RALDH2 as the endogenous source of RA establishing cardiac AP fates provides a useful model to approach the mechanisms whereby the vertebrate embryo confers axial information on its organs.",

        "Abstract": "Although retinoic acid (RA) has been shown to be critical for lung development, little is known about when RA is required and the role of individual RA receptors (RAR) in this process. Previously reported data from an RA responsive element RARE-lacZ reporter mouse show that when epithelial tubules are branching and differentiating RA signaling becomes markedly down-regulated in the epithelium. It is unclear why this down-regulation occurs and what role it might play in the developing lung. Here we analyze the effects of preventing potential progenitors of the distal lung from turning off RA signaling by locally expressing constitutively activated RARalpha or RARbeta chimeric receptors (RARVP16) in branching airways of transgenic mice. Continued RA activation resulted in lung immaturity in both cases, but the phenotypes were remarkably different. RARalphaVP16 lungs did not expand to form saccules or morphologically identifiable type I cells. High levels of surfactant protein C (Sp-C), thyroid transcription factor-1 (Ttf1), and Gata6, but not Sp-A or Sp-B in the epithelium at birth suggested that in these lungs differentiation was arrested at an early stage. These alterations were not observed in RARbetaVP16 lungs, which showed relatively less severe changes. Our data suggest a model in which activation of RAR signaling at the onset of lung development establishes an initial program that assigns distal cell fate to the prospective lung epithelium. Down-regulation of RA signaling, however, is required to allow completion of later steps of this differentiation program that ultimately form mature type I and II cells.",

        "Abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) 10 is a critical regulator of bud formation during lung morphogenesis. fgf10 is expressed in distal lung mesenchyme at sites of prospective budding from the earliest developmental stages and signals through its epithelial receptor Fgfr2b. Experiments in intact lung organ cultures demonstrate that Fgf10 is a chemotactic factor for distal, but not for proximal, epithelium. This differential response suggests the involvement of an additional mechanism regulating Fgf10-Fgfr2b interactions, because Fgfr2b is uniformly expressed throughout the respiratory tract. Here we use an immunohistochemistry-based binding assay to show that O-sulfated heparan sulfates (HS) are critical for Fgf10 binding to the distal epithelium. We show that altering endogenous gradients of HS sulfation with sodium chlorate or over-O-sulfated synthetic heparin in lung organ cultures dramatically decreases Fgf10 binding. Moreover, we show that under these conditions epithelial binding is not improved by providing exogenous FGF10. Our data suggest that, not only ligand availability, but also the presence of specific patterns of HS modification in the distal lung epithelium are critical determinants of Fgf10 binding to the epithelium and signaling.",

        "Abstract": "Signaling by fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) through FGFR2b is essential for lung development. Heparan sulfates (HS) are major modulators of growth factor binding and signaling present on cell surfaces and extracellular matrices of all tissues. Although recent studies provide evidence that HS are required for FGF-directed tracheal morphogenesis in Drosophila, little is known about the HS role in FGF10-mediated bud formation in the vertebrate lung. Here, we mapped HS expression in the early lung and we investigated how HS interactions with FGF10-FGFR2b influence lung morphogenesis. Our data show that a specific set of HS low in O-sulfates is dynamically expressed in the lung mesenchyme at the sites of prospective budding near Fgf10-expressing areas. In turn, highly sulfated HS are present in basement membranes of branching epithelial tubules. We show that disrupting endogenous gradients of HS or altering HS sulfation in embryonic lung culture systems prevents FGF10 from inducing local responses and markedly alters lung pattern formation and gene expression. Experiments with selectively sulfated heparins indicate that O-sulfated groups in HS are critical for FGF10 signaling activation in the epithelium during lung bud formation, and that the effect of FGF10 in pattern is in part determined by regional distribution of O-sulfated HS. Moreover, we describe expression of a HS 6-O-sulfotransferase preferentially at the tips of branching tubules. Our data suggest that the ability of FGF10 to induce local budding is critically influenced by developmentally regulated regional patterns of HS sulfation.",
