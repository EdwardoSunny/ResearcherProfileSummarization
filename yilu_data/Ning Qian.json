        "Abstract": "Cancer is a global public health problem. Natural polysaccharides have been shown to enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments. Polygonatum sibiricum (PS) has been used for millennia to treat diverse diseases. PS comprises numerous active constituents, including saponins, peptides, volatile oils, polysaccharides, and lectins. Many studies have highlighted the crucial role of polysaccharides in PS. Modern studies have shown that Polygonatum sibiricum polysaccharide (PSP) exhibits diverse pharmacological activities, including immunomodulatory, antitumor, antioxidant, and anti-aging effects. However, further study of the antitumor mechanisms is difficult because the activities of PSP are closely associated with its complex structural features and the different molecular weights of its components. Therefore, this review focuses on the research background and the extraction and purification of PSP. Studies related to the mechanism of the antitumor effects of PSP constituents of different molecular weights are also summarized, and perspectives on PSP research are presented.",

        "Abstract": "Cancer is a significant health concern, increasingly showing insensitivity to traditional treatments, highlighting the urgent need for safer and more practical treatment options. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) gene therapy drugs have demonstrated promising potential in preclinical and clinical trials for antitumor therapy by regulating tumor-related gene expression. However, RNA's poor membrane permeability and stability restrict its effectiveness in entering and being utilized in cells. An appropriate delivery system is crucial for achieving targeted tumor effects. The tumor microenvironment (TME), characterized by acidity, hypoxia, enzyme overexpression, elevated glutathione (GSH) concentration, and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), is essential for tumor survival. Furthermore, these distinctive features can also be harnessed to develop intelligent drug delivery systems. Various nanocarriers that respond to the TME have been designed for RNA drug delivery, showing the advantages of tumor targeting and low toxicity. This Review discusses the abnormal changes of components in TME, therapeutic RNAs' roles, underlying mechanisms, and the latest developments in utilizing vectors that respond to microenvironments for treating tumors. We hope it provides insight into creating and optimizing RNA delivery vectors to improve their effectiveness.",

        "Abstract": "The nature and function of perisaccadic receptive field (RF) remapping have been controversial. We use a delayed saccade task to reduce previous confounds and examine the remapping time course in the lateral intraparietal area and frontal eye fields. In the delay period, the RF shift direction turns from the initial fixation to the saccade target. In the perisaccadic period, RFs first shift toward the target (convergent remapping), but around the time of saccade onset/offset, the shifts become predominantly toward the post-saccadic RF locations (forward remapping). Thus, unlike forward remapping that depends on the corollary discharge (CD) of the saccade command, convergent remapping appears to follow attention from the initial fixation to the target. We model the data with attention-modulated and CD-gated connections and show that both sets of connections emerge automatically in neural networks trained to update stimulus retinal locations across saccades. Our work thus unifies previous findings into a mechanism for transsaccadic visual stability.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the T cell immunoreceptor with ITIM and Ig domains (TIGIT) expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). TIGIT expression was measured by western blot, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Seventy-two paired surgical specimens were collected from patients with stage I-IV LUAD. The expression of TIGIT in surgical specimens was determined using immunohistochemistry. TIGIT was overexpressed in LUAD tissues. Moreover, overexpressed TIGIT was significantly associated with advanced clinical staging, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and TP53 mutations in LUAD. Moreover, high expression of TIGIT was negatively correlated with purity of CD4+ T cells. High rations of TIGIT+CD4+ T cells predicted poor overall survival of LUAD patients. Additionally, high ratios of TIGIT+CD4+ T cells is closely related to CD4+ T cell depletion. Taken together, TIGIT was overexpressed in LUAD patients. High levels of TIGIT induced the alteration of CD4+ T cell based immunomodulation and predicted poor prognosis of LUAD patients. Therefore, TIGIT can be potential biomarker for LUAD.",

        "Abstract": "There are limited published studies on patient activation among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in China. Disease activity can significantly influence a patient's perception of their condition, subsequently impacting patient activation. However, the mechanisms through which disease activity influences patient activation remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate patient activation among patients with SLE in China and explore the influencing factors. We conducted a cross-sectional study from June to December 2021 at a rheumatology and immunology department of a tertiary hospital in Chengdu, China. Data were collected by questionnaire, including general information, disease activity, quality of chronic illness care, health literacy, self-efficacy, motivation, social support, and patient activation. A patient activation model was constructed based on the conceptual framework derived from the individual and family self-management theory. To evaluate the moderating effect of disease activity on patient activation model, participants were divided into two subgroups (low disease activity group and high disease activity group). 426 SLE patients were included. The mean score of patient activation among SLE patients was 63.28\u2009\u00b1\u200911.82, indicating that most SLE patients lacked skills and confidence to stick with health-promoting behaviors. Health literacy, social support, and self-efficacy had the greatest effect on patient activation. In the multi-group analysis, social support and health literacy contributed more to patient activation in SLE patients with high and low disease activity, respectively. Patient activation among SLE patients in China was at the third level. Healthcare professionals should help them adhere to health-promoting behaviors. Health literacy, social support, and self-efficacy are vital factors for patient activation. These factors should be prioritized based on disease activity when developing individually tailored interventions for patient activation.",

        "Abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has long been considered a major clinical challenge due to its aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are known as the main cells responsible for tumor origination, progression, recurrence and metastasis. Here, we report that M2-type tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute to cancer stemness in TNBC cells via the secretion of VEGFA. Reciprocally, elevated VEGFA expression by TAM-educated TNBC cells acts as a regulator of macrophage polarization, therefore constitute a feed-back loop between TNBC cells and TAMs. Mechanistically, VEGFA facilitates the CSC phenotype via the NRP-1 receptor and downstream GAPVD1/Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in TNBC cells. Our study underscores the crosstalk between TNBC cells and TAMs mediated by VEGFA and further clarifies the role and underlying mechanisms of the VEGFA/NRP-1/GAPVD1 axis in regulating cancer stemness. We also document an immunosuppressive function of VEGFA in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, the present study indicates crosstalk between TNBC cells and TAMs induced by VEGFA and provides a potential implication for the combination of immunotherapy and VEGFA-targeted agents in TNBC therapy.",

Moreover, under some circumstances, the risks associated with trace metals are not necessarily lower than those associated with organic contaminants. This study aimed to investigate methods to evaluate the possible risks associated with 11 trace metals (Ti, Ba, Sr, Rb, V, Li, Mo, Co, Cs, Bi, and Tl) in soil and biota samples from the Shengli Oilfield using ICP-MS.

        "Title": "Targeting ENPP1 for cancer immunotherapy: Killing two birds with one stone.",
        "Abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy, particularly with immune checkpoint inhibitors, has revolutionized the paradigm of cancer treatment. Nevertheless, the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy remains limited in most clinical settings due to the lack of a preexisting antitumor T-cell response in tumors. Therefore, the clinical outcomes of cancer immunotherapy must be improved crucially. With increased awareness of the importance of the innate immune response in the recruitment of T cells, as well as the onset and maintenance of the T cell response, great interest has been shown in activating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway to awaken the innate immune response, thereby orchestrating both innate and adaptive immune responses to induce tumor clearance. However, tumor cells have evolved to overexpress ectonucleotide pyrophosphate phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1), which degrades the immunotransmitter 2',3'-cGAMP and promotes the production of immune-suppressing adenosine, resulting in inhibition of the anticancer immune response in the tumor microenvironment. Clinically, ENPP1 overexpression is closely associated with poor prognosis in patients with cancer. Conversely, depleting or inhibiting ENPP1 has been verified to elevate extracellular 2',3'-cGAMP levels and inhibit the generation of adenosine, thereby reinvigorating the anticancer immune response for tumor elimination. A variety of ENPP1 inhibitors have recently been developed and have demonstrated significant promise for cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we provide an overview of ENPP1, dissect its immunosuppressive mechanisms, and discuss the development of ENPP1 inhibitors with the potential to further improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "The nature and function of perisaccadic receptive-field (RF) remapping have been controversial. We used a delayed saccade task to reduce previous confounds and examined the remapping time course in areas LIP and FEF. In the delay period, the RF shift direction turned from the initial fixation to the saccade target. In the perisaccadic period, RFs first shifted toward the target (convergent remapping) but around the time of saccade onset/offset, the shifts became predominantly toward the post-saccadic RF locations (forward remapping). Thus, unlike forward remapping that depends on the corollary discharge (CD) of the saccade command, convergent remapping appeared to follow attention from the initial fixation to the target. We modelled the data with attention-modulated and CD-gated connections, and showed that both sets of connections emerged automatically in neural networks trained to update stimulus retinal locations across saccades. Our work thus unifies previous findings into a mechanism for transsaccadic visual stability.",

        "Abstract": "As China's urbanization accelerates, ecological environmental issues have become increasingly prominent, and how to achieve the synergistic development of urbanization and ecological environment is worth exploring. The paper uses the Super-SBM model and the improved entropy method to calculate the ecological efficiency and the new urbanization in 63 counties in Zhejiang Province from 2000 to 2019. Furthermore, the coupling coordination degree between new urbanization and ecological efficiency is discussed with the coupling degree model, Markov chain, and spatial correlation methods, and its influencing factors are explored by the geographic detector. The results show that: (1) The development trends of new urbanization and ecological efficiency in Zhejiang Province counties both present a \"U\" shape. Their inflection points appeared in 2005 and 2006, respectively. The gap between counties is gradually narrowing. (2) The coupling coordination degree between new urbanization and ecological efficiency in Zhejiang Province counties also develops in a \"U\" shape with the minimum value appearing in 2006. Its temporal evolution is dominated by advancement towards a higher level and maintenance of the original type, with most countries advancing from General Disorder to Preliminary Coordination. There is a good positive correlation in the spatial distribution, showing significant High-High and Low-Low agglomeration. (3) In detecting the driving factors, the explanatory power of economic development, natural conditions and social conditions diminishes sequentially. The interaction groups mostly are nonlinear enhancements, and the rest are all two-factor enhancements. Social factors are the main interaction objects. (4) The empirical analysis verified the efficacy of the \"Two Mountains\" theory and the importance of government investment in the regional coordinated development.",

        "Abstract": "Even though retinal images of objects change their locations following each eye movement, we perceive a stable and continuous world. One possible mechanism by which the brain achieves such visual stability is to construct a craniotopic coordinate by integrating retinal and extraretinal information. There have been several proposals on how this may be done, including eye-position modulation (gain fields) of retinotopic receptive fields (RFs) and craniotopic RFs. In the present study, we investigated coordinate systems used by RFs in the lateral intraparietal (LIP) cortex and frontal eye fields (FEF) and compared the two areas. We mapped the two-dimensional RFs of neurons in detail under two eye fixations and analyzed how the RF of a given neuron changes with eye position to determine its coordinate representation. The same recording and analysis procedures were applied to the two brain areas. We found that, in both areas, RFs were distributed from retinotopic to craniotopic representations. There was no significant difference between the distributions in the LIP and FEF. Only a small fraction of neurons was fully craniotopic, whereas most neurons were between the retinotopic and craniotopic representations. The distributions were strongly biased toward the retinotopic side but with significant craniotopic shifts. These results suggest that there is only weak evidence for craniotopic RFs in the LIP and FEF, and that transformation from retinotopic to craniotopic coordinates in these areas must rely on other factors such as gain fields.",

        "Abstract": "A series of studies have suggested that stage N2 is vulnerable and strongly affected by the first-night effect (FNE). However, the neurophysiological mechanism underlying the vulnerability of stage N2 of the FNE has not been well examined. A total of 17 healthy adults (11 women and 6 men, mean age: 21.59 \u00b1 2.12) underwent two nights of polysomnogram recordings in the sleep laboratory. We analyzed sleep structure and central and autonomic nervous system activity during stage N2 and applied the electroencephalographic (EEG) activation index (beta/delta power ratio) and heart rate variability to reflect changes in central and autonomic nervous system activity caused by the FNE. Correlation analyses were performed between EEG activation and heart rate variability. The results showed that EEG activation and high-frequency heart rate variability increased on the adaptation night (Night 1). Importantly, EEG activation was significantly associated with the percentage of stage N1, and the correlation between EEG activation and high-frequency heart rate variability decreased due to the FNE. These findings indicate that the FNE affects the instability of stage N2 by increasing central nervous system activity and uncoupling the activity between the central and autonomic nervous systems.",

        "Abstract": "It is challenging to synchronize switched time-delay systems when some modes are uncontrolled and the dwell time (DT) of controlled mode is very small. Therefore, in this article, global exponential synchronization almost surely (GES a.s.) in a cluster of switched neural networks (NNs) with hybrid delays (time-varying delay and infinite-time distributed delay) is investigated, where transition probability (TP)-based random mode-dependent average DT (MDADT) switching is considered. A novel mode-dependent pinning event-triggered controller with nonidentical deception attacks is proposed to save the communication resource and derive less conservative results. The two necessary and restrictive conditions in existing papers that the value of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) before switching instants should be smaller than that after corresponding instant and the DT of each switching mode is restricted by the sampling intervals of the event trigger are moved. Sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are given to guarantee the GES a.s., even though both synchronizing and nonsynchronizing modes coexist and maybe the minimum DT of synchronizing modes is very small. Numerical examples, including image encryption, are provided to demonstrate the merits of the new technique.",

        "Title": "Searching Efficient Model-guided Deep Network for Image Denoising.",
        "Abstract": "Unlike the success of neural architecture search (NAS) in high-level vision tasks, it remains challenging to find computationally efficient and memory-efficient solutions to low-level vision problems such as image restoration through NAS. One of the fundamental barriers to differential NAS-based image restoration is the optimization gap between the super-network and the sub-architectures, causing instability during the searching process. In this paper, we present a novel approach to fill this gap in image denoising application by connecting model-guided design (MoD) with NAS (MoD-NAS). Specifically, we propose to construct a new search space under a model-guided framework and develop more stable and efficient differential search strategies. MoD-NAS employs a highly reusable width search strategy and a densely connected search block to automatically select the operations of each layer as well as network width and depth via gradient descent. During the search process, the proposed MoD-NAS remains stable because of the smoother search space designed under the model-guided framework. Experimental results on several popular datasets show that our MoD-NAS method has achieved at least comparable even better PSNR performance than current state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters, fewer flops, and less testing time.",

        "Abstract": "Sensory processing is often studied by examining how a given neuron responds to a parameterized set of stimuli (tuning curve) or how a given stimulus evokes responses from a parameterized set of neurons (population response). Although tuning curves and the corresponding population responses contain the same information, they can have different properties. These differences are known to be important because the perception of a stimulus should be decoded from its population response, not from any single tuning curve. The differences are less studied in the spatial domain where a cell's spatial tuning curve is simply its receptive field (RF) profile. Here, we focus on evaluating the common belief that perrisaccadic forward and convergent RF shifts lead to forward (translational) and convergent (compressive) perceptual mislocalization, respectively, and investigate the effects of three related factors: decoders' awareness of RF shifts, changes of cells' covering density near attentional locus (the saccade target), and attentional response modulation. We find that RF shifts ",

It involves multiple organs and systems, and an essential aspect of aging is immunosenescence. With the increase of age, the immune system has undergone a series of changes and disorders. These changes have led to a decline in the resistance of the elderly to infection, reduced immunity to vaccines, increased incidence of cancer and autoimmune diseases, and an increased structural prevalence of low-grade inflammation. Moreover, affecting the aging process to a certain extent. This review introduces the changes in the immune system during aging and discusses the consequences and effects of these changes.

        "Abstract": "A series of studies have demonstrated that impaired vigilance performance caused by total sleep deprivation could restore to baseline when recovery sleep is longer than the habitual sleep. However, it is unclear which factors on the recovery night affected the restoration of vigilance performance impaired by sleep deprivation. 22 participant's sleep electroencephalograms were recorded with polysomnography in 8-h baseline sleep and one-night 10-h recovery sleep following 36-h sleep deprivation. Participants completed a 10-min psychomotor vigilance task and subjective ratings after baseline and recovery sleep the following day. Objective vigilance and subjective ratings were impaired by sleep deprivation and recovered to baseline after one-night 10-h recovery sleep. Compared with baseline sleep, sleep depth increased with enhanced delta and theta power density, and sleep duration was also prolonged during recovery sleep. The vigilance performance difference between recovery and baseline sleep was taken as a behavioral index of the restoration of vigilance. The restoration of vigilance was correlated with the delta and theta power density of stage N3 in the frontal and central region during the recovery sleep. These findings indicated that one-night 10-h recovery sleep could restore the impaired objective vigilance and subjective ratings caused by sleep deprivation. The recuperative effect of vigilance relies on individual differences in sleep intensity. Individuals with higher sleep intensity in recovery sleep obtained better vigilance recovery.",

        "Title": "Targeting STING for cancer immunotherapy: From mechanisms to translation.",
        "Abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has achieved unprecedented success in cancer treatment; However, only a subset of patients achieved clinical benefit from this treatment, underscoring the urgent need to identify new strategies to enhance the clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Given the essential role of innate immunity in cancer immune surveillance, tremendous effort has been focused on the innate immune pathways that can be pharmacologically modulated to improve the clinical outcome of checkpoint inhibitors. The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway plays essential roles in host defense against cancers. Activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway induces the expression of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, culminating in promotion of a robust adaptive antitumor immunity. As part of this innate immune signaling pathway, STING is ubiquitously expressed in immune and nonimmune cells. STING activation has been demonstrated to propagate the cancer immunity cycle, remodel the tumor microenvironment, and ultimately eliminate tumor cells. The immunomodulatory roles of STING enable it to be an appealing target for cancer immunotherapy. As such, STING agonists that are capable of triggering antitumor immune responses have been developed in recent years, and several of them have advanced into clinical trials. In this review, we first give an overview on the STING signaling pathway, then dissect the roles of STING activation in different steps of the cancer immunity cycle and finally discuss the development of STING agonists as well as challenges with STING activation, with the potential to make cancer immunotherapy with STING agonists more effective.",

        "Abstract": "The Notch1 (Notch1 receptor) and yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) signaling can regulate breast cancer metastasis. This study aimed at investigating whether and how these two signal pathways crosstalk to promote breast cancer lung metastasis. Here, we show that YAP1 expression was positively correlated with Notch1 in breast cancer according to bioinformatics and experimental validation. Mechanistically, YAP1 with TEA domain transcription factors (TEADs) enhanced Jagged1(JAG1)-Notch1 signaling. Meanwhile, Notch1 promoted YAP1 stability in breast cancer cells by inhibiting the \u03b2-TrCP-mediated degradation, thereby, forming a YAP1- JAG1/Notch1 positive feedback loop in breast cancer. Furthermore, YAP1 enhanced the mammosphere formation and stemness of MDA-MB-231 cells by attenuating the inhibition of the BMP4-SMAD1/5 signaling. In vivo, the YAP1- JAG1/Notch1 positive feedback loop promoted the lung colonization of MDA-MB-231 cells. Our data for the first time indicate that the YAP1-Notch1 positive feedback loop promotes lung metastasis of breast cancer by modulating self-renewal and inhibiting the BMP4-SMAD1/5 signaling.",

The properties of ecDNA enable tumor cells to be more responsive to various environments. The non-Mendelian genetic mechanism of ecDNA could arouse increasing tumor heterogeneity. Besides, ecDNA would promote tumor invasiveness and provide resistance mechanisms associated with poorer survival consequences. Furthermore, ecDNA could profoundly impact oncogene activation, genome instability, tumor heterogeneity, etc. Consequently, they may offer potential possibilities for tumor diagnosis and therapeutics. We primarily reviewed the classification, several primary formation mechanisms, homeostasis maintenance and frontier progress of ecDNA and late emphasized its fundamental roles in tumorigenesis and put forward some new insights.",

        "Title": "First Report of Pyricularia oryzae Causing Blast on Palm Grass in China.",
        "Abstract": "Palm grass (Setaria palmifolia) has been used as an ornamental plant and vegetable crop (Wu, 2009; Plarre, 1995). In June 2019, 2-10 mm severe leaf lesions with gray centers and brown-yellow edges were observed on the leaves of palm grass in Liuyang city (28\u00b043'N, 114\u00b012'E), Hunan province, China (Fig. 1A). Disease incidence on leaves was 20 - 40%. The infected leaves were collected and disinfected with 75% alcohol for 30 sec and 1% sodium hypochlorite for 1 min, followed by three rinses in sterilized ddH2O, dried on sterilized filter paper, and incubated on water agar for 48 h under continuous fluorescent light at 26\u2103. Then, typical pyriform and 2-septate conidia (23.97 - 30.37 \u00d7 7.42 - 9.98 \u03bcm, N = 30) appeared at the lesions (Fig. 1B). Four single-spore were captured, and then grew on oatmeal tomato agar for seven days under continuous fluorescent light at 26\u2103 to obtain four isolates (LY-ZY-7a, -7b, -9b and -9c) and produce conidia for inoculation tests. The colony morphology of LY-ZY-7b on OTA was gray and floccose, and the growth rate was 6.15 - 6.31 mm/d at 26 \u00b0C (Fig. 1C). Spores of LY-ZY-7b were washed off with sterilized ddH2O plus 0.025% Tween-20 to make spore suspensions. For scratch inoculation, 10 \u03bcL spore suspension (1 \u00d7 105 spores/mL) was inoculated on the wound scratched with a sterilized pin along the vein (3 mm \u00d7 3 mm) on palm grass middle leaf of 4-week-old seedlings. The inoculated leaves were sealed in a 15-cm Petri dish. For spray inoculation, 20 mL spore suspension (5 \u00d7 104 spores/mL) was made and sprayed on ten healthy palm grasses of 4-week-old seedlings. Plants used as negative controls were sprayed with sterilized ddH2O plus 0.025% Tween-20 (Liu et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2014). After inoculation, all plants were put into transparent boxes to maintain > 95% humidity and covered with black plastic bags for one day. Then, the boxes containing the plants were placed in a growth chamber at 26\u00b0C (12 h light / 12 h darkness photoperiod). After six days, typical blast-type lesions with brown-yellow edges were visible on the leaves. Control plants did not show symptoms (Fig. 1D, 1E). Microscopical examination showed that the conidia and conidiophore recovered from the lesion of the inoculated plants have the same morphology as those recovered from natural infected tissues (Fig. 1F, 1G). The colony morphology of the pathogen isolated from the artificially inoculated tissue was consistent with that of isolate LY-ZY-7b (Fig. 1C). The spore suspension (5 \u00d7 104 spores/mL) of isolate LY-ZY-7b and one rice-infecting strain P131 (Yang et al., 2010) was made and sprayed onto 4-week-old seedlings of three rice cultivars. But unfortunately, isolate LY-ZY-7b could not cause any disease lesions on the tested rice cultivars, whereas strain P131 produced many typical blast lesions on rice leaves (Fig. 1H). Then, the fungal genetic identity of four isolates (LY-ZY-7a, -7b, -9b, and -9c) was confirmed by comparison of the sequence obtained from partial DNA of Actin (ACT), ITS, and RPB1 loci from our isolates and those previously published by Klaubauf et al. 2014. The nucleotide sequences of ACT, ITS, and RPB1 were submitted to GenBank ON228695-ON228697 (ACT), ON210978-ON210980 (ITS), ON228698-ON228701 (RPB1). A phylogenetic tree deduced from a maximum likelihood analysis based on combined ACT-ITS-RPB1 sequence data of Pyricularia showed that these four isolates (LY-ZY-7a, -7b, -9b, and -9c) clustered together on Pyricularia oryzae, with a high bootstrap support value (Fig. 2). Based on morphological characteristics and molecular phylogeny, these four isolates were identified as P. oryzae (Klaubauf et al. 2014; Qi et al. 2019). To our knowledge, this is the first report of blast disease on palm grass caused by P. oryzae in China, which will help develop disease management strategies against palm grass blast. Moreover, as a host of P. oryzae, palm grass might contribute as an inoculum source for blast diseases on cereal crops (such as rice, wheat, and barley) caused by P. oryzae in the field.",

        "Abstract": "T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) is a novel type of immune checkpoint. Importantly, immune checkpoint molecules promote cancer progression by various antitumor suppressive mechanisms. TIGIT is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells, natural killer cells, and regulatory T cells that was recently attracted attention as a major emerging target for cancer immunotherapy. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play crucial roles in immune homeostasis. Specifically, tumor-infiltrating Tregs promote cancer progression by restricting antitumor immunity and supporting tumor immune escape. In this review, we summarized the current understanding on TIGIT and tumor-infiltrating Tregs. Here, we reviewed the latest advances in the understanding of mechanisms causing tumor-infiltrating Tregs abundance to optimize Tregs targeted therapy. Collectively, anti-TIGIT targeting Tregs hold great promise for potent cancer target therapy.",

        "Abstract": "With the huge therapeutic potential, cancer immunotherapy is expected to become the mainstream of cancer treatment. In the current field of cancer immunotherapy, there are mainly five types. Immune checkpoint blockade therapy is one of the most promising directions. Adoptive cell therapy is an important component of cancer immunotherapy. The therapy with the cancer vaccine is promising cancer immunotherapy capable of cancer prevention. Cytokine therapy is one of the pillars of cancer immunotherapy. Oncolytic immunotherapy is a promising novel component of cancer immunotherapy, which with significantly lower incidence of serious adverse reactions. The recent positive results of many clinical trials with cancer immunotherapy may herald good clinical prospects. But there are still many challenges in the broad implementation of immunotherapy. Such as the immunotherapy cannot act on all tumors, and it has serious adverse effects including but not limited to nonspecific and autoimmunity inflammation. Here, we center on recent progress made within the last 5 years in cancer immunotherapy. And we discuss the theoretical background, as well as the opportunities and challenges of cancer immunotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "A generic, rapid, simple and low-cost analytical method for simultaneously screening and confirming 400 veterinary drugs and other contaminants in raw honey was developed. The method was based on one-step extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry. A well-designed extraction method results in the complete precipitation of proteins and separation of analytes from carbohydrates and reduces the time and cost of analysis by covering polar to non-polar analytes. Optimized pretreatment processes lead to no significant interference on analysis from complicated sample matrix. Competent linearity was found for all of target compounds with linear regression coefficients (R) higher than 0.99. Detection limits ranged from 0.05\u00a0\u00b5g/kg to 10\u00a0\u00b5g/kg. Average recovery rates spiked in raw honey and ranged from 57.3% to 139.8%, and associated relative standard deviation values ranged from 0.4% to 25.2% under selected conditions. The extraction sensitivity, linearity, recovery, and precision of the method were validated. The results clearly demonstrated the feasibility of using this approach in raw honey purchase. The application of this method, which improved efficiency and the coverage of residues, may considerably reduce effort and time in routine monitoring programs.",

Nevertheless, the genome editing efficiency in tumor sites and the clinical applications of CRISPR/Cas have been compromised by non-specific delivery and genotoxicity. Recently, intelligent delivery systems incorporating sensitive materials in response to endogenous stimuli of the tumor microenvironment (TME) have represented viable platforms for tumor-specific genome editing and reduced side effects of CRISPR/Cas. Spurred by this promising direction, this review first introduces the CRISPR/Cas systems widely employed in cancer therapeutic explorations. Various types of CRISPR/Cas delivery systems sensitive to the stimuli in TME and typical dual-/multiple-responsive CRISPR/Cas carriers are further discussed, emphasizing the correlations between sensitive components and spatiotemporal delivery mechanisms. The genome editing efficiencies of CRISPR/Cas-loaded stimuli-responsive carriers are also summarized both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, stimuli-responsive CRISPR/Cas delivery systems hold great promise for potent cancer gene therapy.",

        "Title": "Silencing of miR-10b-5p alleviates the mechanical stretch-induced proliferation of HASMCs.",
        "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important mediators to human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) phenotype remodeling and airway diseases. MicroRNA-10b-5p (miR-10b-5p) has been extensively studied in different fields. This study set out to probe into the effect of miR-10b-5p in cyclic mechanical stretch-induced apoptosis in HASMCs. The results showed that after 15 % deformation, 0.5 s stretching and 0.5 s cyclic mechanical stretching relaxation (0.5 Hz) occurred to HASMCs, miR-10b-5p showed up-regulation without inducing significant apoptosis. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expressions of FLT1 were reduced. Then, dual-luciferase reporter assay verified that FLT1 was targeted by miR-10b-5p, and miR-10b-5p silencing increased FLT1 expression, leading to a prolonged arrest of stretch-treated HASMCs at the G1/S stage, and increased cell apoptosis compared with control group. Furthermore, the activity of Caspase-3 was reinforced, and the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax was markedly reduced after miR-10b-5p silencing. The current study proved that expression levels of p-PI3K and p-Akt in stretch-treated HASMCs of the inhibition group were significantly inhibited in comparison to those of the controls. The effects of miR-10b-5p overexpression are opposite to that of inhibition of miR-10b-5p in stretched HASMCs. In conclusion, this study showed that miR-10b-5p silencing could weaken the hypertrophy of HASMCs. MiR-10b-5p negatively regulated FLT1 expression, but positively regulated the PI3K/Akt pathway in HASMCs. By referring to other previous studies, we concluded that miR-10b-5p might be a potent target in the treatment of airway diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Sensory encoding (how stimuli evoke sensory responses) is known to progress from low- to high-level features. Decoding (how responses lead to perception) is less understood but is often assumed to follow the same hierarchy. Accordingly, orientation decoding must occur in low-level areas such as V1, without cross-fixation interactions. However, a study, Ding, Cueva, Tsodyks, and Qian (2017), provided evidence against the assumption and proposed that visual decoding may often follow a high-to-low-level hierarchy in working memory, where higher-to-lower-level constraints introduce interactions among lower-level features. If two orientations on opposite sides of the fixation are both task relevant and enter working memory, then they should interact with each other. We indeed found the predicted cross-fixation interactions (repulsion and correlation) between orientations. Control experiments and analyses ruled out alternative explanations such as reporting bias and adaptation across trials on the same side of the fixation. Moreover, we explained the data using a retrospective high-to-low-level Bayesian decoding framework.",

        "Abstract": "Rotary longitudinal-torsional coupled ultrasonic vibration-assisted grinding (LTUAG) is a new manufacturing method that can improve the grinding ability of silicon carbide ceramics. However, compared with longitudinal ultrasonic vibration-assisted grinding (LUAG), the role of torsional vibration in the grinding process is unclear. In this study, an effective method for measuring longitudinal-torsional coupled ultrasonic vibration amplitude and an experimental setup for measuring actual amplitude during grinding are proposed. The trajectory of the abrasive grains under the same grinding parameters and the same longitudinal amplitude during LTUAG and LUAG are analysed. Ultrasonic amplitude curves under the condition of tool rotation are then measured and analysed. Finally, the effect of torsional vibration on grinding force and surface roughness under the same grinding conditions is explained. Experimental analysis shows that the introduction of torsional vibration has little effect on the trajectory length and does not change the number of interference overlaps between abrasive grain tracks. Torsional vibration will only increase the cutting speed during grinding and reduce the undeformed chip thickness, which will reduce the grinding force and improve the surface roughness of LTUAG.",

        "Abstract": "The amplification of oncogenes on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) provides a new mechanism for cancer cells to adapt to the changes in the tumor microenvironment and accelerate tumor evolution. These extrachromosomal elements contain oncogenes, and their chromatin structures are more open than linear chromosomes and therefore have stronger oncogene transcriptional activity. ecDNA always contains enhancer elements, and genes on ecDNA can be reintegrated into the linear genome to regulate the selective expression of genes. ecDNA lacks centromeres, and the inheritance from the parent cell to the daughter cell is uneven. This non-Mendelian genetic mechanism results in the increase of tumor heterogeneity with daughter cells that can gain a competitive advantage through a large number of copies of oncogenes. ecDNA promotes tumor invasiveness and provides a mechanism for drug resistance associated with poorer survival outcomes. Recent studies have demonstrated that the overall proportion of ecDNA in tumors is approximately 40%. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of ecDNA in the field of tumorigenesis and development.",

        "Abstract": "The use of cisplatin for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer has long been constrained by the rapid acquisition of tumor cell chemoresistance. In the present study, we sought to better elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance phenotype. To that end, we assessed gene expression patterns in cisplatin-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells, revealing pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 4 (PDK4) to be the most up-regulated kinase in resistant cells. We further found PDK4 upregulation to be directly linked with the acquisition of chemoresistance, driving enhanced tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In clinical samples, we also found that PDK4 upregulation was detectable in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and that it was correlated with a poorer prognosis for these patients. From a mechanistic perspective, we further determined that PDK4 was able to promote lung adenocarcinoma cell growth and cisplatin resistance at least in part via regulating endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1 (EPAS1) expression, thus highlighting PDK4 as a potentially viable therapeutic target in efforts to treat lung adenocarcinoma patients that have become resistant to cisplatin.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterized by extreme fatigue and disabling symptoms. Women with CFS often have a high risk of gynaecological problems such as irregular menstruation, endometriosis and pelvic pain and sexual dysfunction. Our previous results have shown that, in pregnant mice, CFS significantly decreased the progestational hormone level in serum, as well as learning and memory, and the function of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis. In addition, the F1 generation also suffered from congenital hypothyroidism. At present, there has been no report about placenta formation and embryonic development in pregnant mice with CFS. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of CFS on the morphology, oxidative stress and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway during placenta formation. In this study, we found that CFS decreased the number of implantation sites for blastocysts, and increased the number of absorbed, stillborn and malformed fetuses. The morphology and structure of the placenta were abnormal in pregnant mice with CFS. Further study found that the oxidative stress in serum, uterus and placenta was increased in pregnant mice with CFS, while the levels of antioxidase were decreased. CFS also inhibited the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway in the placenta. These results suggested that inhibition of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway and enhanced oxidative stress play an important role in abnormal placentation in pregnant mice with CFS.",

        "Abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a crucial factor in cancer progression. In breast cancer, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and the derived stromal components have been recognized as comprising the majority of the pathological structure of the TME. In this study, we show that metformin (Met), a diabetes drug, transforms CAFs in the TME. Met disrupts tumor-stromal cross talk by preventing breast cancer cell transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling and the production of stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) by CAFs. The suppression of bidirectional signaling between tumor cells and CAFs by Met is attributed to increased phospho-AMP kinase (p-AMPK) levels. By upregulating p-AMPK in CAFs, Met induces prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), leading to the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) in CAFs. Moreover, interruption of HIF-1\u03b1-driven SDF-1 signaling in CAFs by Met leads to decreased breast cancer cell invasion. These findings suggest that Met may be used to target tumor-promoting signaling between CAFs and breast cancer cells in the TME.",

Although great progress has been made in immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint, only a subset of patients responds to this treatment, suggesting that cancer immune evasion is still a major barrier in current immunotherapy. There are a series of factors contributing to immune evasion despite in an immunocompetent environment. Given that these factors are involved in different steps of the cancer immune cycle. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of immune escape in each step of the cancer immune cycle and then present therapeutic strategies for overcoming immune escape, with the potential to better understand the determinants of immune escape and make anti-tumor immunity more effective.",

        "Abstract": "Deficits in glutamatergic function are well established in schizophrenia (SZ) as reflected in \"input\" dysfunction across sensory systems. By contrast, less is known about contributions of the GABAergic system to impairments in excitatory/inhibitory balance. We investigated this issue by measuring contrast thresholds for orientation detection, orientation discriminability, and orientation-tilt-aftereffect curves in schizophrenia subjects and matched controls. These measures depend on the amplitude and width of underlying orientation tuning curves, which, in turn, depend on excitatory and inhibitory interactions. By simulating a well-established V1 orientation selectivity model and its link to perception, we demonstrate that reduced cortical excitation and inhibition are both necessary to explain our psychophysical data. Reductions in GABAergic feedback may represent a compensatory response to impaired glutamatergic input in SZ, or a separate pathophysiological event. We also found evidence for the widely accepted, but rarely tested, inverse relationship between orientation discriminability and tuning width.",

        "Title": "Suppression of TRIM8 by microRNA-182-5p restricts tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1-induced proliferation and migration of airway smooth muscle cells through inactivation of NF-\u039ab.",
        "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical modulators involved in the regulation of airway remodeling in asthma. MicroRNA-182-5p (miR-182-5p) has been reported as a key miRNA in regulating the proliferation and migration of various cell types, and its dysfunction contributes is implicated in a wide range of pathological processes. Yet, it remains unknown whether miR-182-5p modulates the proliferation and migration of airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells during asthma. In the present study, we aimed to determine the potential role of miR-182-5p in regulating the proliferation and migration of ASM cells induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in vitro. We found that TNF-\u03b1 stimulation markedly reduced miR-182-5p expression in ASM cells. Gain-of-function experiments showed that miR-182-5p upregulation suppressed the proliferation and migration of ASM cells induced by TNF-\u03b1. By contrast, miR-182-5p inhibition had the opposite effect. Notably, tripartite motif 8 (TRIM8) was identified as a target gene of miR-182-5p. TRIM8 expression was induced by TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, and TRIM8 knockdown markedly impeded TNF-\u03b1-induced ASM cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, miR-182-5p overexpression or TRIM8 knockdown significantly downregulated the activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) induced by TNF-\u03b1. However, TRIM8 restoration partially reversed the miR-182-5p-mediated inhibitory effect on TNF-\u03b1-induced ASM cell proliferation and migration. In conclusion, our study indicates that miR-182-5p restricts TNF-\u03b1-induced ASM cell proliferation and migration through downregulation of NF-\u03baB activation via targeting TRIM8. The results of our study highlight the potential importance of the miR-182-5p/TRIM8/NF-\u03baB axis in the airway remodeling of asthma.",

        "Abstract": "Deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) leads to malignant growth and aggressive invasion during cancer occurrence and progression. miR-147b has emerged as one of the cancer-related miRNAs that are dysregulated in multiple cancers. Yet, the relevance of miR-147b in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to report the biological function and signalling pathways mediated by miR-147b in NSCLC. Our results demonstrate that miR-147b expression is significantly downregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-147b decreased the proliferative ability, colony-forming capability, and invasive potential of NSCLC cells. Notably, our study identified ribosomal protein S15A (RPS15A), an oncogene in NSCLC, as a target gene of miR-147b. Our results showed that miR-147b negatively modulates RPS15A expression in NSCLC cells. An inverse correlation between miR-147b and RPS15A was evidenced in NSCLC specimens. Moreover, miR-147b overexpression downregulated the activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling via targeting of RPS15A. Overexpression of RPS15A partially reversed the miR-147b-mediated antitumour effect in NSCLC cells. Collectively, these findings reveal that miR-147b restricts the proliferation and invasion of NSCLC cells by inhibiting RPS15A-induced Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling and suggest that the miR-147b/RPS15A/Wnt/\u03b2-catenin axis is an important regulatory mechanism for malignant progression of NSCLC.",

Antibody fragments that further enhance penetration and retain the most critical antigen-specific binding functions are considered the focus of research targeting cancer imaging and therapy. Thanks to the superior penetration and rapid blood clearance of antibody fragments, antibody fragment-based imaging agents enable efficient and sensitive imaging of tumour sites. In tumour-targeted therapy, antibody fragments can directly inhibit tumour proliferation and growth, serve as an ideal carrier for delivery of anti-tumour drugs, or manipulate the immune system to eliminate tumour cells.

        "Abstract": "Gut microbiome lives in the intestinal tract of animals and plays an important role in almost all life processes. Gut microbiome balance is beneficial to health, and imbalance leads to many diseases, one of which is obesity epidemic. However, gut microbiome is also influenced by host hormone, and different gut microbiome composition is observed between the sexes. Here, we studied whether castrated male Guizhou minipigs with obesity own the same gut microbiome composition and microbial function predictions with those in obese females. We sequenced the hypervariable regions V3 to V4 of bacterial 16s rRNA of fecal samples collected from our study subjects. We observed that the operational taxonomic units were small, which suggested that the abundance of gut microbiome may be influenced by low genetic diversity of host. Our results also suggested that the castrated male has different gut microbial composition compared to the obese female. An increasing Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was observed in both castrated male and obese female groups, which suggested that the main adipogenic gut microorganism in obese Guizhou minipigs in our studies is the same with that in other obese mammals. However, we also observed that there were function prediction differences of obese Guizhou minipigs between female and castrated male, which suggested that the influence of gut microbiome on obesity between them is different.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) poses a great threat to human health. The elegant combination of gene therapy and chemotherapy by nanocarriers has been repeatedly highlighted to realize enhanced therapeutic efficacy relative to monotreatment. However, the leading strategy to achieve the efficient codelivery of the gene and drug remains the electrostatic condensation with the nucleic acid and the hydrophobic encapsulation of drug molecules by the nanocarriers, which suffers substantially from premature drug leakage during circulation and severe off-target-associated side effects. To address these issues, we reported in this study the codelivery of liver-specific miRNA-122 and anti-cancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) using a macromolecular prodrug approach, that is, electrostatic condensation with miRNA-122 using galactosylated-chitosan-5-fluorouracil (GC-FU). The delivery efficacy was evaluated comprehensively in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, the biocompatibility of GC-FU/miR-122 nanoparticles (NPs) was assessed by hemolysis activity analysis, BSA adsorption test, and cell viability assay in both normal liver cells (L02 cells) and endothelial cells. The resulting codelivery systems showed enhanced blood and salt stability, efficient proliferation inhibition of HCC cells, and further induction apoptosis of HCC cells, as well as downregulated expression of ADAM17 and Bcl-2. The strategy developed herein is thus a highly promising platform for an effective codelivery of miRNA-122 and 5-Fu with facile fabrication and great potential for the clinical translation toward HCC synergistic therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory response remains one of the most common and serious complications of disease. In order to profound understanding relationship between Phellinus linteus polysaccharides (TCM) and inflammation, inflammatory cell model was constructed by LPS acting RAW264.7 cell line. The results showed that TCM could decrease the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-12) contents and the mRNA expression levels and increase the anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) contents and the mRNA expression levels. Additionally, the levels of NF-\u03baB translocation was significantly decreased, which associated with the I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation level decreased and the AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation level increased. These results indicated that TCM could reduce the inflammatory responses in the LPS induced inflammatory cell model might be related to inhibit NF-\u03baB translocation and regulate the balance of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory factors.",

In this study, we identified a poorly-studied kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 2 (PDK2) as the most up-regulated kinase encoding gene in Cisplatin resistant lung adenocarcinoma. Additionally, PDK2-dependent Cisplatin-resistance promotes tumour growth of lung adenocarcinoma both in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, PDK2 expression was up-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma and was correlated to the poor prognosis of lung cancer patients. Mechanically, PDK2 promoted cell growth and Cisplatin-resistance of lung adenocarcinoma via transcriptional regulation of cyclin and CBS domain divalent metal cation transport mediator 3 (CNNM3), indicating that PDK2-CNNM3 signalling axis could be a potential therapeutic target for Cisplatin-resistant lung adenocarcinoma.",

        "Title": "A Single, Continuously Applied Control Policy for Modeling Reaching Movements with and without Perturbation.",
        "Abstract": "It has been debated whether kinematic features, such as the number of peaks or decomposed submovements in a velocity profile, indicate the number of discrete motor impulses or result from a continuous control process. The debate is particularly relevant for tasks involving target perturbation, which can alter movement kinematics. To simulate such tasks, finite-horizon models require two preset movement durations to compute two control policies before and after the perturbation. Another model employs infinite- and finite-horizon formulations to determine, respectively, movement durations and control policies, which are updated every time step. We adopted an infinite-horizon optimal feedback control model that, unlike previous approaches, does not preset movement durations or use multiple control policies. It contains both control-dependent and independent noises in system dynamics, state-dependent and independent noises in sensory feedbacks, and different delays and noise levels for visual and proprioceptive feedbacks. We analytically derived an optimal solution that can be applied continuously to move an effector toward a target regardless of whether, when, or where the target jumps. This single policy produces different numbers of peaks and \"submovements\" in velocity profiles for different conditions and trials. Movements that are slower or perturbed later appear to have more submovements. The model is also consistent with the observation that subjects can perform the perturbation task even without detecting the target jump or seeing their hands during reaching. Finally, because the model incorporates Weber's law via a state representation relative to the target, it explains why initial and terminal visual feedback are, respectively, less and more effective in improving end-point accuracy. Our work suggests that the number of peaks or submovements in a velocity profile does not necessarily reflect the number of motor impulses and that the difference between initial and terminal feedback does not necessarily imply a transition between open- and closed-loop strategies.",

        "Abstract": "Pleural fibrosis can dramatically lower the quality of life. Numerous studies have reported that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulated by transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is involved in fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanism is inadequately understood. Fibroblast-specific protein-1 (S100A4) is a target of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. In our previous study, we have reported that S100A4 is highly expressed in pleural fibrosis. Thus, we suggest that S100A4 took part in the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in pleural fibrosis. In this study, we determined the expression of S100A4 and EMT-related markers in Met-5A cells (pleural mesothelial cells) treated with TGF-\u03b2 or TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor by real-time PCR and western blot. In order to explore the role of S100A4, we used siRNA to knock down the expression of S100A4 in cell model. We found that the expression of epithelial cell marker was decreased and the mesenchymal cell marker increased with S100A4 upregulation after treatment with TGF-\u03b2. Moreover, the changes of EMT-related event were restricted when the expression of S100A4 was knocked down. Conversely, S100A4 can partially rescue the EMT-related expression changes induced by TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor. These findings suggest that S100A4 expression is induced by the TGF-\u03b2 pathway, and silencing S100A4 expression can inhibit the process of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT.",

        "Title": "Visual perception as retrospective Bayesian decoding from high- to low-level features.",
        "Abstract": "When a stimulus is presented, its encoding is known to progress from low- to high-level features. How these features are decoded to produce perception is less clear, and most models assume that decoding follows the same low- to high-level hierarchy of encoding. There are also theories arguing for global precedence, reversed hierarchy, or bidirectional processing, but they are descriptive without quantitative comparison with human perception. Moreover, observers often inspect different parts of a scene sequentially to form overall perception, suggesting that perceptual decoding requires working memory, yet few models consider how working-memory properties may affect decoding hierarchy. We probed decoding hierarchy by comparing absolute judgments of single orientations and relative/ordinal judgments between two sequentially presented orientations. We found that lower-level, absolute judgments failed to account for higher-level, relative/ordinal judgments. However, when ordinal judgment was used to retrospectively decode memory representations of absolute orientations, striking aspects of absolute judgments, including the correlation and forward/backward aftereffects between two reported orientations in a trial, were explained. We propose that the brain prioritizes decoding of higher-level features because they are more behaviorally relevant, and more invariant and categorical, and thus easier to specify and maintain in noisy working memory, and that more reliable higher-level decoding constrains less reliable lower-level decoding.",

Following peer-review and acceptance of the above referenced paper for publication in Lung Cancer, the Editor-in-Chief was contacted by the Editor-in-Chief of the journal, Gene Therapy, with information that the manuscript had simultaneously been submitted to both Lung Cancer and Gene Therapy. A referee selected to review the manuscript for Gene Therapy was also contacted by the Editor-in-Chief of the journal, Respiratory Research, with a request to review the same manuscript for that journal. The three journals ascertained that the manuscript had been simultaneously submitted to all three journals. In addition, as part of their investigation of potential simultaneous submission, the Editors of Lung Cancer compared the manuscript submitted to Gene Therapy with that accepted for publication in Lung Cancer, and this has raised concerns related to the data presented in the paper. The paper accepted for publication in Lung Cancer examines A549 and H810 cells. The paper submitted to Gene Therapy examines A549 and H510A cells. However, the data presented in both papers, including the figures, are identical. The Editors of Lung Cancer have asked the authors for an explanation, but the corresponding author has not responded.

        "Abstract": "The site of overt attention (fixation point) defines a spatial reference center that affects visuomotor response as indicated by the stimulus-response-compatibility (SRC) effect: When subjects press, e.g., a left key to report stimuli, their reaction time is shorter when stimuli appear to the left than to the right of the fixation. Covert attention to a peripheral site appears to define a similar reference center but previous studies did not control for confounding spatiotemporal factors or investigate the relationship between overt- and covert-attention-defined centers. Using an eye tracker to monitor fixation, we found an SRC effect relative to the site of covert attention induced by a flashed cue dot, and a concurrent reduction, but not elimination, of the overt-attention SRC effect. The two SRC effects jointly determined the overall motor reaction time. Since trials with different cue locations were randomly interleaved, the integration of the two reference centers must be updated online. When the cue was invalid and diminished covert attention, the covert-attention SRC effect disappeared and the overt-attention SRC effect retained full strength, excluding non-attention-based interpretations. We conclude that both covert- and overt-attention sites define visual reference centers that simultaneously contribute to motor response.",

        "Title": "Abscisic acid, sucrose, and auxin coordinately regulate berry ripening process of the Fujiminori grape.",
        "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the effect of abscisic acid (ABA), sucrose, and auxin on grape fruit development and to assess the mechanism of these three factors on the grape fruit ripening process. Different concentrations of ABA, sucrose, and auxin were used to treat the grape fruit, and the ripening-related indices, such as physiological and molecular level parameters, were analyzed. The activity of BG protein activity was analyzed during the fruit development. Sucrose, ABA, and auxin influenced the grape fruit sugar accumulation in different ways, as well as the volatile compounds, anthocyanin content, and fruit firmness. ABA and sucrose induced, but auxin blocked, the ripening-related gene expression levels, such as softening genes PE, PG, PL, and CELL, anthocyanin genes DFR, CHI, F3H, GST, CHS, and UFGT, and aroma genes Ecar, QR, and EGS. ABA, sucrose, and glucose induced the fruit dry weight accumulation, and auxin mainly enhanced fruit dry weight through seed weight accumulation. In the early development of grape, starch was the main energy storage; in the later, it was glucose and fructose. Sucrose metabolism pathway-related gene expression levels were significant for glucose and fructose accumulation. BG protein activity was important in the regulation of grape ABA content levels. ABA plays a core role in the grape fruit development; sucrose functions in fruit development through two pathways: one was ABA dependent, the other ABA independent. Auxin blocked ABA accumulation to regulate the fruit development process.",

        "Abstract": "A novel type of macromolecular prodrug delivery system is reported in this research. The N-galactosylated-chitosan-5-fluorouracil acetic acid conjugate (GC-FUA) based nanoparticle delivery system was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Biocompatibility of GC-FUA-NPs was screened by BSA adsorption test and hemolysis activity examination in vitro. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake study in HepG2 and A549 cells demonstrated that compared to free 5-Fu, the GC-FUA-NPs play great function in killing cancer cells for the cell endocytosis mediated by asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), which overexpresses on the cell surface. Pharmacokinetics study further illustrated that the drug-loaded nanoparticles has a much longer half-time than free 5-Fu in blood circulation in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Tissue distribution was investigated in Kunming mice, and the result showed that the GC-FUA-NPs have a long circulation effect. The obtained data suggested that GC-FUA-NP is a very promising drug delivery system for efficient treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.",

        "Abstract": "The development of slow release nano-sized carriers for efficient antineoplastic drug delivery with a biocompatible and biodegradable pectin-based macromolecular pro-drug for tumor therapy has been reported in this study. Pectin-doxorubicin conjugates (PDC), a macromolecular pro-drug, were prepared via an amide condensation reaction, and a novel amphiphilic core-shell micell based on a PDC macromolecular pro-drug (PDC-M) was self-assembled in situ, with pectin as the hydrophilic shell and doxorubicin (DOX) as the hydrophobic core. Then the chemical structure of the PDC macromolecular pro-drug was identified by both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-NMR), and proved that doxorubicin combined well with the pectin and formed macromolecular pro-drug. The PDC-M were observed to have an unregularly spherical shape and were uniform in size by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The average particle size of PDC-M, further measured by a Zetasizer nanoparticle analyzer (Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments), was about 140 nm. The encapsulation efficiency and drug loading were 57.82% \u00b1 3.7% (n = 3) and 23.852% \u00b12.3% (n = 3), respectively. The in vitro drug release behaviors of the resulting PDC-M were studied in a simulated tumor environment (pH 5.0), blood (pH 7.4) and a lysosome media (pH 6.8), and showed a prolonged slow release profile. Assays for antiproliferative effects and flow cytometry of the resulting PDC-M in HepG2 cell lines demonstrated greater properties of delayed and slow release as compared to free DOX. A cell viability study against endothelial cells further revealed that the resulting PDC-M possesses excellent cell compatibilities and low cytotoxicities in comparison with that of the free DOX. Hemolysis activity was investigated in rabbits, and the results also demonstrated that the PDC-M has greater compatibility in comparison with free DOX. This shows that the resulting PDC-M can ameliorate the hydrophobicity of free DOX. This work proposes a novel strategy for in-situ one-step synthesis of macromolecular pro-drugs and fabrication of a core-shell micelle, demonstrating great potential for cancer chemotherapy.",

There is an important need to determine diagnostic and prognostic markers for this disease. Eph receptors are the largest known family of receptor tyrosines characterised in humans. These receptors are involved in the development and progression of various diseases including cancer. EphB6 contains kinase domains that are altered in several conserved amino acids and is catalytically inactive. The aim of the present study was to correlate the immunohistological expression of EphB6 in a cohort of patients with epithelial ovarian tumours with clinicopathological parameters and survival.",

        "Title": "Solving stereo transparency with an extended coarse-to-fine disparity energy model.",
        "Abstract": "Modeling stereo transparency with physiologically plausible mechanisms is challenging because in such frameworks, large receptive fields mix up overlapping disparities, whereas small receptive fields can reliably compute only small disparities. It seems necessary to combine information across scales. A coarse-to-fine disparity energy model, with both position- and phase-shift receptive fields, has already been proposed. However, because each scale decodes only one disparity for each location and uses the decoded disparity to select cells at the next scale, this model cannot represent overlapping surfaces at different depths. We have extended the model to solve stereo transparency. First, we introduce multiplicative connections from cells at one scale to the next to implement coarse-to-fine computation. The connection is the strongest when the presynaptic cell's preferred disparity matches the postsynaptic cell's position-shift parameter, encouraging the next scale to encode residual disparities with the more reliable phase-shift mechanism. This modification not only eliminates the artificial decoding and selection steps of the original model but also enables maintenance of complete population responses throughout the coarse-to-fine process. Second, because of this modification, explicit decoding is no longer necessary but rather is for visualization only. We use a simple threshold criterion to decode multiple disparities from population energy responses instead of a single disparity in the original model. We demonstrate our model using simulations on a variety of transparent and nontransparent stereograms. The model also reproduces psychophysically observed disparity interactions (averaging, thickening, attraction, and repulsion) as the depth separation between two overlapping planes varies.",

        "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. The Notch signaling pathway has been shown to be associated with the development and progression of many human cancers, including breast cancer, but the precise mechanism remains unknown. Here, the influence of Notch1 signaling in mammary epithelial cells was studied. We showed that Notch1 promotes proliferation in MCF7 and MCF10A cells. Transwell assay indicated that Notch1 overexpression promotes cell migration and the invasion of breast cancer cells. We showed that MCF7 and MCF10A cells overexpressing Notch1 acquired features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and displayed a cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype. The expression levels of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and occludin were decreased, while the expression levels of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, vimentin and fibronectin were increased in cells overexpressing Notch1. We demonstrated that Notch1 induced phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in breast cancer cells and increased the expression of p65 and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2. Inhibition of STAT3 activity by JSI124 reduced the expression of p65 and IL-1. Treatment of MCF7-notch1 and MCF10A-notch1 cells with JSI124 also reduced the expression of N-cadherin, markers of epithelial mesenchymal transition and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Our results suggest that Notch1 promotes EMT and the CSC phenotype through induction of STAT3.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of lentiviral\u2011mediated Cys\u2011Asn\u2011Gly\u2011Arg\u2011Cys (CNGRC) peptide gene transduction in adipose stem cells. Adipose stem cells were prepared using enzymatic digestion and repeated adherence methods and identified in culture by immunofluorescence staining of surface markers. The pluripotency of the cultured adipose stem cells was confirmed by their induced differentiation into bone and fat cells. Following polymerase chain reaction amplification, the gene sequence for the CNGRC peptide was cloned into a lentiviral vector, which was then co\u2011transfected into 293T cells with packaging plasmids Helper 1.0 and Helper 2.0. The lentiviruses carrying the CNGRC peptide gene were then harvested and used to transfect adipose stem cells. Following transduction, expression of CNGRC in adipose stem cells was detected using western blot analysis. Adipose stem cells in culture were successfully induced to differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts and the lentiviral vector containing CNGRC\u20113Flag\u2011EGFP was successfully constructed. Following transduction, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining demonstrated expression of the CNGRC protein in adipose stem cells. This suggested that adipose stem cell lines expressing the CNGRC peptide were successfully established.",

        "Title": "Breast cancer cells are arrested at different phases of the cell cycle following the re-expression of ARHI.",
        "Abstract": "ARHI is a maternally imprinted tumor suppressor gene that is expressed in normal breast epithelial cells but not in most breast cancer cells. Aberrant methylation and hypernomic histone deacetylation have been implicated in the silencing of ARHI. To investigate the mechanism of ARHI induction, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were either transfected with the eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3.1(+)-ARHI, or were simultaneously treated with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, [trichostatin A, (TSA)] and the methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC). The latter treatment group also included the targeting of ARHI by small interfering RNA (siRNA) to further examine interactions between ARHI and the drugs applied. Levels of ARHI were detected by western blotting, MTT assays were used to evaluate cell proliferation, and both cell cycle progression and apoptosis were detected using flow cytometry. Both the transfection of pcDNA3.1(+)\u2011ARHI and the application of TSA+DAC induced the expression of ARHI. Furthermore, reduced cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest and enhanced apoptosis were observed for both groups compared to controls. However, a G1/S cell cycle arrest was observed for the pcDNA3.1(+)-ARHI group, while a G2 cell cycle arrest was observed for the TSA+DAC group. The latter effect was reversed with the introduction of ARHI-targeted siRNA in combination with TSA+DAC treatment. To further clarify these observations, expression levels of several key cell cycle regulators were analyzed by western blotting. The pcDNA3.1(+)-ARHI group exhibited higher expression levels of p53, p21 and p27, and lower levels of cyclin D1, CDK4 and CDK6 when compared to the control group (P<0.05). For the TSA+DAC group, higher levels of p53, p21, cyclin B1 and Chk1 were detected, concomitant with lower levels of CDK1, when compared to the control group. Taken together, these results suggest that ARHI acts as a tumor suppressor gene in MDA-MB-231 cells and, although TSA+DAC can block the cells at different cell cycle phage, the antitumor effect is ARHI-dependent.",

        "Abstract": "It is well-established that triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer, characterized by a poor prognosis and aggressive biological behavior. However, the available relevant data on TNBC in non-Western populations are limited. In order to analyze the clinicopathological and molecular biological characteristics and observe survival and prognostic factors, 972 breast cancer patients (156 of whom had TNBC) who received treatment at the First Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University and the First Hospital of China Medical University, between January, 2004 and January, 2007 were retrospectively evaluated. In the univariate analysis, tumor size, TNM stage, axillary lymph node status and recurrence or metastasis were identified as prognostic factors for 7-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Our multivariate Cox's regression analysis demonstrated that tumor size and axillary lymph node status were significant prognostic factors for 7-year DFS and OS. Notably, tumor subgroup (TNBC vs. non-TNBC) was a significant prognostic factor associated with 7-year DFS and OS in breast cancer. It was suggested that TNBC exhibited a worse 7-year survival compared with that in non-TNBC patients, most likely due to its more aggressive behavior and insensitivity to specific therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Design and synthesis of nucleoside analogues have persistently attracted extensive interest because of their potential application in the field of antiviral therapy, and its study also receives additional impetus for improvement in the ProTide technology. Previous studies have made great strides in the design and discovery of monophosphorylated nucleoside analogues as potential kinase-independent antiretrovirals. In this work, a series of nucleoside phosphoramidates modified by distamycin analogues was synthesized and evaluated as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in HIV-1-infected MT-4 and CEM cells, including variations in nucleoside, alkyl moiety, and the structure of distamycin analogues. These compounds exhibited modest potency with the EC50 value in the range of 1.3- to 6.5-fold lower than their corresponding parent drugs in MT-4 cells, which may be attributed to increasing intracellular availability due to the existence of distamycin analogue with favorable hydrophilic-lipophilic equilibrium. Meanwhile, the length of distamycin analogue was considered and assessed as an important factor that could affect antiviral activity and cytotoxicity.

        "Title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 activation promotes migration and invasion of breast cancer cells through epithelial-mesenchymal transition.",
        "Abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1 or Flt-1), a tyrosine kinase receptor, is highly expressed in breast cancer tissues, but near absent in normal breast tissue. While VEGFR-1 expression is associated with poor prognosis of women with breast cancer, it is not clear whether it is involved in the aggressiveness of breast cancer. Thus, the present study examined whether VEGFR-1 activation is associated with the invasiveness of breast cancer. We reported that VEGFR-1 was detected in 60.6% of invasive breast carcinoma tissue sections. In addition, VEGFR-1 expression positively correlated with lymph node-positive tumor status, low expression level of membranous E-cadherin, and high expression levels of N-cadherin and Snail. We found that PlGF-mediated VEGFR-1 activation promoted migration and invasion in MCF-7 (luminal) cells and led to morphologic and molecular changes of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This was blocked by the down-regulation of VEGFR-1. Conversely, down-regulation of VEGFR-1 in MDA-MB-231 (post-EMT) cells resulted in morphologic and molecular changes similar to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), and exogenous PlGF could not reverse these changes. Moreover, VEGFR-1 activation led to an increase in nuclear translocation of Snail. Finally, MDA-MB-231 cells expressing shRNA against VEGFR-1 significantly decreased the tumor growth and metastasis capacity in a xenograft model. Histological examination of VEGFR-1/shRNA-expressing tumor xenografts showed up-regulation of E-cadherin and down-regulation of N-cadherin and Snail. These findings suggest that VEGFR-1 may promote breast cancer progression and metastasis, and therapies that target VEGFR-1 may be beneficial in the treatment of breast cancer patients.",

        "Abstract": "A wealth of studies has found that adapting to second-order visual stimuli has little effect on the perception of first-order stimuli. This is physiologically and psychologically troubling, since many cells show similar tuning to both classes of stimuli, and since adapting to first-order stimuli leads to aftereffects that do generalize to second-order stimuli. Focusing on high-level visual stimuli, we recently proposed the novel explanation that the lack of transfer arises partially from the characteristically different backgrounds of the two stimulus classes. Here, we consider the effect of stimulus backgrounds in the far more prevalent, lower-level, case of the orientation tilt aftereffect. Using a variety of first- and second-order oriented stimuli, we show that we could increase or decrease both within- and cross-class adaptation aftereffects by increasing or decreasing the similarity of the otherwise apparently uninteresting or irrelevant backgrounds of adapting and test patterns. Our results suggest that similarity between background statistics of the adapting and test stimuli contributes to low-level visual adaptation, and that these backgrounds are thus not discarded by visual processing but provide contextual modulation of adaptation. Null cross-adaptation aftereffects must also be interpreted cautiously. These findings reduce the apparent inconsistency between psychophysical and neurophysiological data about first- and second-order stimuli.",

        "Title": "Movement duration, Fitts's law, and an infinite-horizon optimal feedback control model for biological motor systems.",
        "Abstract": "Optimization models explain many aspects of biological goal-directed movements. However, most such models use a finite-horizon formulation, which requires a prefixed movement duration to define a cost function and solve the optimization problem. To predict movement duration, these models have to be run multiple times with different prefixed durations until an appropriate duration is found by trial and error. The constrained minimum time model directly predicts movement duration; however, it does not consider sensory feedback and is thus applicable only to open-loop movements. To address these problems, we analyzed and simulated an infinite-horizon optimal feedback control model, with linear plants, that contains both control-dependent and control-independent noise and optimizes steady-state accuracy and energetic costs per unit time. The model applies the steady-state estimator and controller continuously to guide an effector to, and keep it at, target position. As such, it integrates movement control and posture maintenance without artificially dividing them with a precise, prefixed time boundary. Movement pace is determined by the model parameters, and the duration is an emergent property with trial-to-trial variability. By considering the mean duration, we derived both the log and power forms of Fitts's law as different approximations of the model. Moreover, the model reproduces typically observed velocity profiles and occasional transient overshoots. For unbiased sensory feedback, the effector reaches the target without bias, in contrast to finite-horizon models that systematically undershoot target when energetic cost is considered. Finally, the model does not involve backward and forward sweeps in time, its stability is easily checked, and the same solution applies to movements of different initial conditions and distances. We argue that biological systems could use steady-state solutions as default control mechanisms and might seek additional optimization of transient costs when justified or demanded by task or context.",

        "Title": "Multi-level visual adaptation: dissociating curvature and facial-expression aftereffects produced by the same adapting stimuli.",
        "Abstract": "Adaptation aftereffects offer a critical window onto sensory processing in the brain. However, such sensory processing is hierarchical, progressing from the extraction of simple features to the representation of complex patterns. The way that adaptation depends on coordinated changes across different levels of the hierarchy has been studied. However, when a given adapting stimulus produces both a low- and a high-level aftereffect, it remains unclear whether the high-level aftereffect is a passive reflection of low-level adaptation, or whether it is generated, at least partially, de novo in high-level areas. We assembled the two key ingredients needed for investigating this question psychophysically. One ingredient involves perceptual tasks that depend rather exclusively on low or high levels of processing, and yet involve partially identical stimuli that inspire cross-level adaptation. For this, we considered the discrimination of curvature or facial expression using curves or cartoon faces. The other ingredient is spatial or temporal stimulus manipulations that limit adaptation to either low or high levels. For this, we used crowding and brief presentations. We found that crowding an adapting curve with flanking curves reduces the curvature aftereffect much more than the facial-expression aftereffect, and vice versa for crowding the adapting face with flanking faces. Additionally, reducing adaptation time to a cartoon face diminishes the curvature aftereffect more drastically than the facial-expression aftereffect. These results suggest that high-level aftereffects, even when generated by a low-level adaptor, are not completely inherited from lower levels, and offer a window into the determining factors.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a minority of tumor cells possessing the stem cell properties of self-renewal and differentiation in leukemia and several solid tumors. However, these cells do not possess the normal regulatory mechanisms of stem cells. Following transplantation, they are capable of initiating tumorigenesis and are therefore known as 'tumor stem cells'. Cellular origin analysis of tumor stem cells has resulted in three hypotheses: Embryonal rest hypothesis, anaplasia and maturation arrest. Several signaling pathways which are involved in carcinogenesis, including Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, Notch and Oct-4 signaling pathways are crucial in normal stem cell self-renewal decisions, suggesting that breakdown in the regulation of self-renewal may be a key event in the development of tumors. Thus, tumors can be regarded as an abnormal organ in which stem cells have escaped from the normal constraints on self-renewal, thus, leading to abnormally differentiated tumor cells that lose the ability to form tumors. This new model for maligancies has significance for clinical research and treatment.",

        "Title": "Intestinal microbial community diversity between healthy and orally infected rabbit with Entamoeba histolytica by ERIC-PCR.",
        "Abstract": "Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR was applied to analyze the difference of intestinal microbial community diversity between healthy and orally infected rabbits with Entamoeba histolytica. The dynamic changes in different parts of digestive system including the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, and rectum in healthy and infected rabbits at different time points were also tested. The intestinal microbial community of the control healthy rabbits was steady, and the total number of ERIC-PCR bands in the control healthy rabbit was the least in the rectum and the most in the caecum. ERIC-PCR bands of orally inoculated rabbits did not obviously change until 24 h after postinoculation (p.i.). The numbers of the ERIC-PCR bands gradually decreased from 24 to 72 h p.i., and then, with the development of disease, the band numbers gradually increased until 6 days p.i. Sequence analysis showed that the nucleotide sequence homologies of the fragment about 1,200 bp of infected ileum sampled at 32 h p.i. were above 95 % with Sinorhizobium meliloti enterobacterial, Erwinia amylovora and Salmonella typhimurium, and the nucleotide sequence homologies of the fragment about 300 bp of infected ileum sampled at 48 h p.i. were more than 90 % with Xanthomonas campestris enterobacterial, Yersinia enterocolitica subsp., Shigella flexneri, S. meliloti enterobacterial, Yersinia pestis, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp., and Escherichia coli. The prominent bacteria had changed after E. histolytica infection. The DNAstar of staple of ERIC-PCR showed that aerobe and facultative aerobe (E. coli, Shigella, and Salmonella) became preponderant bacilli in the intestine of orally infected rabbits with E. histolytica.",

        "Abstract": "Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 plays critical roles in tumorigenesis, tumor cell growth, and angiogenesis, and inhibiting the expression of COX-2 by gene therapy has showed promising prospects. Vectors are crucial for gene therapy. Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers are one type of nano-vectors. In this study, we synthesized a generation 4 polyamidoamine (G4PAMAM) dendrimer/COX-2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide complex (G4PAMAM/COX-2ASODN), determined the transfection rate of G4PAMAM/COX-2ASODN on cultured breast cancer cells, assessed the cell viability, cell cycle dynamics, and cell invasiveness after transfection, and investigated the effects of G4PAMAM/COX-2ASODN on the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein and microvessel density (MVD) levels in the tumor tissues of a breast cancer nude mouse model. The results showed that G4PAMAM/COX-2ASODN had a high transfection rate, decreased the cell viability, induced apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and suppressed cell invasiveness. After treatment with G4PAMAM/COX-2ASODN, the copy number of COX-2 mRNA and protein expression in the tumor tissue were decreased markedly, MVD in the tumor tissue was also decreased, and tumor growth was restrained (p<0. 05). We conclude that COX-2ASODN can be delivered into the cultured and transplanted breast cancer cells efficiently by G4PAMAM, can reduce the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein, and can lower the MVD of tumor tissues. The G4PAMAM/COX-2ASODN complex has antitumor properties in vitro and in vivo.",

        "Title": "A learning-style theory for understanding autistic behaviors.",
        "Abstract": "Understanding autism's ever-expanding array of behaviors, from sensation to cognition, is a major challenge. We posit that autistic and typically developing brains implement different algorithms that are better suited to learn, represent, and process different tasks; consequently, they develop different interests and behaviors. Computationally, a continuum of algorithms exists, from lookup table (LUT) learning, which aims to store experiences precisely, to interpolation (INT) learning, which focuses on extracting underlying statistical structure (regularities) from experiences. We hypothesize that autistic and typical brains, respectively, are biased toward LUT and INT learning, in low- and high-dimensional feature spaces, possibly because of their narrow and broad tuning functions. The LUT style is good at learning relationships that are local, precise, rigid, and contain little regularity for generalization (e.g., the name-number association in a phonebook). However, it is poor at learning relationships that are context dependent, noisy, flexible, and do contain regularities for generalization (e.g., associations between gaze direction and intention, language and meaning, sensory input and interpretation, motor-control signal and movement, and social situation and proper response). The LUT style poorly compresses information, resulting in inefficiency, sensory overload (overwhelm), restricted interests, and resistance to change. It also leads to poor prediction and anticipation, frequent surprises and over-reaction (hyper-sensitivity), impaired attentional selection and switching, concreteness, strong local focus, weak adaptation, and superior and inferior performances on simple and complex tasks. The spectrum nature of autism can be explained by different degrees of LUT learning among different individuals, and in different systems of the same individual. Our theory suggests that therapy should focus on training autistic LUT algorithm to learn regularities.",

To make the results meaningful, a side-by-side bacteriology method (indirect immuno-fluorescent antibody staining) was performed too. The results of indirect immuno-fluorescent antibody staining and immunohistochemical localization were similar to the fluorescent quencher PCR assay. The time course of the appearance of bacterial antigens and tissue lesions in various tissues was coincident with the levels of the bacterial DNA loads at the infection sites. This suggests that Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis loads in internal organs are closely correlated with the progression of the infection.",

With the rapid development of molecular biology and immunologic techniques and the deep research on ocular tumor related genes, it becomes possible to diagnose and treat malignant tumors from the molecular level. The tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) super family, is a promising candidate, either alone or in combination with established cancer therapies, since it can initiate apoptosis through the activation of their death receptors. The ability of TRAIL to selectively induce apoptosis of transformed, virus-infected or tumor cells but not normal cells promotes the development of TRAIL-based cancer therapy. Here, we will review TRAIL and its receptors' structure, function, mechanism of action and application in ocular tumors therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Polyamidoamine dendrimer (PAMAM-D) is a new gene vector developed in recent years. In this study, we successfully prepared G4PAMAM and detected its unique structure by NMR, FITR and TEM. We revealed that G4PAMAM could bind to human erythrocytes and BSA through electrostatic interaction respectively, and caused haemolysis and reduced bioavailability. However, G4PAMAM-VEGF-ASODN (antisense oligodeoxynucleotides) complex could prevent G4PAMAM from binding to the erythrocytes and BSA and remained stable as a conjugate, therefore the toxicity of the complex was reduced. Meanwhile, we showed that G4PAMAM could be used as a gene vector to deliver AODNs into breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells without significant cell toxicity, and it enhanced cellular uptake of ODNs. In vivo experiment of human breast tumor xenograft mice model, G4PAMAM also showed more efficiency of accumulating VEGF-ASODN to inhibit the tumor vascularization of breast tumor tissue than naked AODN. Furthermore, G4PAMAM could protect DNA in cytoplasm from digestion of restriction enzymes, which was important to become an effective tool in gene research and therapy.",

        "Title": "V1 orientation plasticity is explained by broadly tuned feedforward inputs and intracortical sharpening.",
        "Abstract": "Orientation adaptation and perceptual learning change orientation tuning curves of V1 cells. Adaptation shifts tuning curve peaks away from the adapted orientation, reduces tuning curve slopes near the adapted orientation, and increases the responses on the far flank of tuning curves. Learning an orientation discrimination task increases tuning curve slopes near the trained orientation. These changes have been explained previously in a recurrent model (RM) of orientation selectivity. However, the RM generates only complex cells when they are well tuned, so that there is currently no model of orientation plasticity for simple cells. In addition, some feedforward models, such as the modified feedforward model (MFM), also contain recurrent cortical excitation, and it is unknown whether they can explain plasticity. Here, we compare plasticity in the MFM, which simulates simple cells, and a recent modification of the RM (MRM), which displays a continuum of simple-to-complex characteristics. Both pre- and postsynaptic-based modifications of the recurrent and feedforward connections in the models are investigated. The MRM can account for all the learning- and adaptation-induced plasticity, for both simple and complex cells, while the MFM cannot. The key features from the MRM required for explaining plasticity are broadly tuned feedforward inputs and sharpening by a Mexican hat intracortical interaction profile. The mere presence of recurrent cortical interactions in feedforward models like the MFM is insufficient; such models have more rigid tuning curves. We predict that the plastic properties must be absent for cells whose orientation tuning arises from a feedforward mechanism.",

        "Title": "The role of background statistics in face adaptation.",
        "Abstract": "Cross-adaptation is widely used to probe whether different stimuli share common neural mechanisms. For example, that adaptation to second-order stimuli usually produces little aftereffect on first-order stimuli has been interpreted as reflecting their separate processing. However, such results appear to contradict the cue-invariant responses of many visual cells. We tested the novel hypothesis that the null aftereffect arises from the large difference in the backgrounds of first- and second-order stimuli. We created second-order faces with happy and sad facial expressions specified solely by local directions of moving random dots on a static-dot background, without any luminance-defined form cues. As expected, adaptation to such a second-order face did not produce a facial-expression aftereffect on the first-order faces. However, consistent with our hypothesis, simply adding static random dots to the first-order faces to render their backgrounds more similar to that of the adapting motion face led to a significant aftereffect. This background similarity effect also occurred between different types of first-order stimuli: real-face adaptation transferred to cartoon faces only when noise with correlation statistics of real faces or natural images was added to the cartoon faces. These findings suggest the following: (1) statistical similarities between the featureless backgrounds of the adapting and test stimuli can influence aftereffects, as in contingent adaptation; (2) weak or null cross-adaptation aftereffects should be interpreted with caution; and (3) luminance- and motion-direction-defined forms, and local features and global statistics, converge in the representation of faces.",

        "Abstract": "Pulfrich phenomena are a class of depth illusions generated by an interocular time delay. This may be demonstrated with continuously moving stimuli, stroboscopic displays undergoing apparent motion, or dynamic noise patterns. Previous studies suggest that neurons jointly tuned to motion and disparity may be responsible for the phenomena. Model cells with such joint coding can explain all Pulfrich phenomena in a unified way (N. Qian & R. A. Andersen, 1997). However, the joint-coding idea has been challenged by recent models (J. C. Read & B. G. Cumming, 2005a, 2005c) that focus on the S shaped functions of perceived disparity in stroboscopic Pulfrich effect (M. J. Morgan, 1979). Here we demonstrate fundamental problems with the recent models in terms of causality, physiological plausibility, and definitions for joint and separate coding, and we compare the two coding schemes under physiologically plausible assumptions. We show that joint coding of disparity and either unidirectional or bidirectional motion selectivity can account for the S curves, but unidirectional selectivity is required to explain direction-depth contingency in Pulfrich effects. In contrast, separate coding can explain neither the S curves nor the direction-depth contingency. We conclude that Pulfrich phenomena are logically accounted for by joint encoding of unidirectional-motion and disparity.",

        "Abstract": "Adaptation is ubiquitous in sensory processing. Although sensory processing is hierarchical, with neurons at higher levels exhibiting greater degrees of tuning complexity and invariance than those at lower levels, few experimental or theoretical studies address how adaptation at one hierarchical level affects processing at others. Nevertheless, this issue is critical for understanding cortical coding and computation. Therefore, we examined whether perception of high-level facial expressions can be affected by adaptation to low-level curves (i.e., the shape of a mouth). After adapting to a concave curve, subjects more frequently perceived faces as happy, and after adapting to a convex curve, subjects more frequently perceived faces as sad. We observed this multilevel aftereffect with both cartoon and real test faces when the adapting curve and the mouths of the test faces had the same location. However, when we placed the adapting curve 0.2 degrees below the test faces, the effect disappeared. Surprisingly, this positional specificity held even when real faces, instead of curves, were the adapting stimuli, suggesting that it is a general property for facial-expression aftereffects. We also studied the converse question of whether face adaptation affects curvature judgments, and found such effects after adapting to a cartoon face, but not a real face. Our results suggest that there is a local component in facial-expression representation, in addition to holistic representations emphasized in previous studies. By showing that adaptation can propagate up the cortical hierarchy, our findings also challenge existing functional accounts of adaptation.",

        "Abstract": "Just as China has struggled with bringing an expanding economy to a country with large areas of economic underdevelopment, the Chinese health care system is experiencing tension between tradition and modernization. Because of this tension, health care in the Peoples' Republic of China has been undergoing significant reform since the beginning of the 1980s. Experiments in market-based health systems have been unsuccessful and have exacerbated disparities. New reforms, announced in 2006, stress the role of family physicians in leading the health care system. This paper discusses the history of the developments that led up to the new reforms and the educational challenges of training sufficient numbers of family physicians to meet the requirements of the new system.",

        "Title": "Solving da Vinci stereopsis with depth-edge-selective V2 cells.",
        "Abstract": "We propose a new model for da Vinci stereopsis based on a coarse-to-fine disparity energy computation in V1 and disparity-boundary-selective units in V2. Unlike previous work, our model contains only binocular cells, relies on distributed representations of disparity, and has a simple V1-to-V2 feedforward structure. We demonstrate with random-dot stereograms that the V2 stage of our model is able to determine the location and the eye-of-origin of monocularly occluded regions, and improve disparity map computation. We also examine a few related issues. First, we argue that since monocular regions are binocularly defined, they cannot generally be detected by monocular cells. Second, we show that our coarse-to-fine V1 model for conventional stereopsis explains double matching in Panum's limiting case. This provides computational support to the notion that the perceived depth of a monocular bar next to a binocular rectangle may not be da Vinci stereopsis per se [Gillam, B., Cook, M., & Blackburn, S. (2003). Monocular discs in the occlusion zones of binocular surfaces do not have quantitative depth--a comparison with Panum's limiting case. Perception 32, 1009-1019.]. Third, we demonstrate that some stimuli previously deemed invalid have simple, valid geometric interpretations. Our work suggests that studies of da Vinci stereopsis should focus on stimuli more general than the bar-and-rectangle type and that disparity-boundary-selective V2 cells may provide a simple physiological mechanism for da Vinci stereopsis.",

        "Title": "The transition from open to endoscopic saphenous vein harvesting and its clinical impact: The Texas Heart Institute experience.",
        "Abstract": "Open saphenous vein harvesting can be associated with wound complications, incision pain, prolonged convalescence, and poor cosmetic results. Endoscopic vein harvesting has been widely used for prevention of these problems. We compared outcomes of open and endoscopic vein harvesting for coronary artery bypass grafting at the Texas Heart Institute. We retrospectively analyzed data from 1,573 consecutive coronary artery bypass procedures performed at our institution during a 20-month period. Each procedure included saphenectomy by endoscopic vein harvesting (n = 588) performed by physician assistants, or by traditional open vein harvesting (n = 985) performed by physicians or physician assistants. The primary outcome variable was the incidence of postoperative leg infections. Both groups were similar in terms of preoperative risk factors. After surgery, leg wound infections were significantly less frequent in the endoscopic vein harvesting group (3/588, 0.5%) than in the open vein harvesting group (27/985, 2.7%; P < 0.002). The most common organism involved in leg infections was Staphylococcus (20/30, 66%): S. aureus was present in 14 of 30 infections (47%). Open vein harvesting was the only significant independent risk factor for leg infection. We conclude that endoscopic vein harvesting reduces leg wound infections, is safe and reliable, and should be the standard of care when venous conduits are required for coronary artery bypass grafting and vascular procedures. Although the transition from open to endoscopic vein harvesting can be challenging in institutions, it can be successful if operators receive adequate training in endoscopic technique and are supported by surgeons and staff.",

        "Abstract": "It has been shown that motion aftereffect (MAE) not only is present at the adapted location but also partially transfers to nearby non-adapted locations. However, it is not clear whether MAE transfers across the fixation point. Since cells in area MSTd have receptive fields that cover both sides of the fixation point and since many MSTd cells, but not cells in earlier visual areas, prefer complex motion patterns such as expansion, we tested cross-fixation transfer of MAE induced by expanding random-dots stimuli. We also used rightward translational motion for comparison. Subjects adapted to motion patterns on a fixed side of the fixation point. Dynamic MAE was then measured with a nulling procedure at both the adapted site and the mirror site across the fixation point. Subjects' eye fixation during stimulus presentation was monitored with an infrared eye tracker. At the adapted site, both the expansion and the translation patterns generated strong MAEs, as expected. However, only the expansion pattern, but not translation pattern, generated significant MAE at the mirror site. This remained true even after we adjusted stimulus parameters to equate the strengths of the expansion MAE and translation MAE at the adapted site. We conclude that there is cross-fixation transfer of MAE for expansion motion but not for translational motion.",

        "Title": "Comparison among some models of orientation selectivity.",
        "Abstract": "Several models exist for explaining primary visual cortex (V1) orientation tuning. The modified feedforward model (MFM) and the recurrent model (RM) are major examples. We have implemented these two models, at the same level of detail, alongside a few newer variations, and thoroughly compared their receptive-field structures. We found that antiphase inhibition in the MFM enhances both spatial phase information and orientation tuning, producing well-tuned simple cells. This remains true for a newer version of the MFM that incorporates untuned complex-cell inhibition. In contrast, when the recurrent connections in the RM are strong enough to produce typical V1 orientation tuning, they also eliminate spatial phase information, making the cells complex. Introducing phase specificity into the connections of the RM (as done in an original version of the RM) can make the cells phase sensitive, but the cells show an incorrect 90 degrees peak shift of orientation tuning under opposite contrast signs. An inhibition-dominant version of the RM can generate well-tuned cells across the simple-complex spectrum, but it predicts that the net effect of cortical interactions is to suppress feedforward excitation across all orientations in simple cells. Finally, adding antiphase inhibition used in the MFM into the RM produces a most general model. We call this new model the modified recurrent model (MRM) and show that this model can also produce well-tuned cells throughout the simple-complex spectrum. Unlike the inhibition-dominant RM, the MRM is consistent with data from cat V1, suggesting that the net effect of cortical interactions is to boost simple cell responses at the preferred orientation. These results suggest that the MFM is well suited for explaining orientation tuning in simple cells, whereas the standard RM is for complex cells. The assignment of the RM to complex cells also avoids conflicts between the RM and the experiments of cortical inactivation (done on simple cells) and the spatial-frequency dependency of orientation tuning (found in simple cells). Because orientation-tuned V1 cells show a continuum of simple- to complex-cell behavior, the MRM provides the best description of V1 data.",

        "Title": "An optimization principle for determining movement duration.",
        "Abstract": "Movement duration is an integral component of motor control, but nearly all extant optimization models of motor planning prefix duration instead of explaining it. Here we propose a new optimization principle that predicts movement duration. The model assumes that the brain attempts to minimize movement duration under the constraint of meeting an accuracy criterion. The criterion is task and context dependent but is fixed for a given task and context. The model determines a unique duration as a trade-off between speed (time optimality) and accuracy (acceptable endpoint scatter). We analyzed the model for a linear motor plant, and obtained a closed-form equation for determining movement duration. By solving the equation numerically with specific plant parameters for the eye and arm, we found that the model can reproduce saccade duration as a function of amplitude (the main sequence), and arm-movement duration as a function of the ratio of target distance to size (Fitts's law). In addition, it explains the dependency of peak saccadic speed on amplitude and the dependency of saccadic duration on initial eye position. Furthermore, for arm movements, the model predicts a scaling relationship between peak velocity and distance and a reduction in movement duration with a moderate increase in viscosity. Finally, for a linear plant, our model predicts a neural control signal identical to that of the minimum-variance model set to the same movement duration. This control signal is a smooth function of time (except at the endpoint), in contrast to the discontinuous bang-bang control found in the time-optimal control literature. We suggest that one aspect of movement planning, as revealed by movement duration, may be to assign an endpoint accuracy criterion for a given task and context.",

        "Abstract": "Observers can better discriminate orientation or direction near the cardinal axes than near an oblique axis. We investigated whether this well-known oblique effect is determined by the physical or the perceived axis of the stimuli. Using the simultaneous tilt illusion, we generated perceptually different orientations for the same inner (target) grating by contrasting it with differently oriented outer gratings. Subjects compared the target orientation with a set of reference orientations. If orientation discriminability was determined by the physical orientations, the psychometric curves for the same target grating would be identical. Instead, all subjects produced steeper curves when perceiving target gratings near vertically as opposed to more obliquely. This result of orientation discrimination was confirmed by using adaptation-generated tilt aftereffect to manipulate the perceived orientation of a given physical orientation. Moreover, we obtained the same result in direction discrimination by using motion repulsion to alter the perceived direction of a given physical direction. We conclude that when the perceived orientation or direction differs from the physical orientation or direction, the oblique effect depends on perceived, rather than physical, orientation or direction. Finally, as a by-product of the study, we found that, around the vertical direction, motion repulsion is much stronger when the inducing direction is more clockwise to the test direction than when it is more counterclockwise.",

        "Abstract": "Motion repulsion involves interaction between two directions of motion. Since attention is known to bias interactions among different stimuli, we investigated the effect of attentional tasks on motion repulsion. We used two overlapping sets of random dots moving in different directions. When subjects had to detect a small speed-change or luminance change for dots along one direction, the repulsive influence from the other direction was significantly reduced compared with the control case without attentional tasks. However, when the speed-change could occur to either direction such that subjects had to attend both directions to detect the change, motion repulsion was not different from the control. A further experiment showed that decreasing the difficulty of the attentional task resulted in the disappearance of the attentional effect in the case of attention to one direction. Finally, over a wide range of contrasts for the unattended direction, attention reduced repulsion measured with the attended direction. These results are consistent with the physiological finding that strong attention to one direction of motion reduces inhibitory effects from the other direction.",

        "Title": "Is depth perception of stereo plaids predicted by intersection of constraints, vector average or second-order feature?",
        "Abstract": "Stereo plaid stimuli were created to investigate whether depth perception is determined by an intersection of constraints (IOC) or vector average (VA) operation on the Fourier components, or by the second-order (non-Fourier) feature in a pattern. We first created stereo plaid stimuli where IOC predicted vertical disparity, VA predicted positive diagonal disparity and the second-order feature predicted negative diagonal disparity. In a depth discrimination task, observers indicated whether they perceived the pattern as 'near' or 'far' relative to a zero-disparity aperture. Observers' perception was consistent with the disparity predicted by VA, indicating its dominance over IOC and the second-order feature in this condition. Additional stimuli in which VA predicted vertical disparity were created to investigate whether VA would dominate perception when it was a less reliable cue. In this case, observers' performance was consistent with disparity predicted by IOC or the second-order feature, not VA. Finally, in order to determine whether the second-order feature contributes to depth perception, stimuli were created where IOC and VA predicted positive horizontal disparity while the second-order feature predicted negative horizontal disparity. When the component gratings were oriented near horizontal (+/-83 degrees from vertical), depth perception corresponded to that predicted by the second-order feature. However, as the components moved away from horizontal (+/-75 degrees and +/-65 degrees from vertical), depth perception was increasingly likely to be predicted by an IOC or VA operation. These experiments suggest that the visual system does not rely exclusively on a single method for computing pattern disparity. Instead, it favours the most reliable method for a given condition.",

        "Title": "Different predictions by the minimum variance and minimum torque-change models on the skewness of movement velocity profiles.",
        "Abstract": "We investigated the differences between two well-known optimization principles for understanding movement planning: the minimum variance (MV) model of Harris and Wolpert (1998) and the minimum torque change (MTC) model of Uno, Kawato, and Suzuki (1989). Both models accurately describe the properties of human reaching movements in ordinary situations (e.g., nearly straight paths and bell-shaped velocity profiles). However, we found that the two models can make very different predictions when external forces are applied or when the movement duration is increased. We considered a second-order linear system for the motor plant that has been used previously to simulate eye movements and single-joint arm movements and were able to derive analytical solutions based on the MV and MTC assumptions. With the linear plant, the MTC model predicts that the movement velocity profile should always be symmetrical, independent of the external forces and movement duration. In contrast, the MV model strongly depends on the movement duration and the system's degree of stability; the latter in turn depends on the total forces. The MV model thus predicts a skewed velocity profile under many circumstances. For example, it predicts that the peak location should be skewed toward the end of the movement when the movement duration is increased in the absence of any elastic force. It also predicts that with appropriate viscous and elastic forces applied to increase system stability, the velocity profile should be skewed toward the beginning of the movement. The velocity profiles predicted by the MV model can even show oscillations when the plant becomes highly oscillatory. Our analytical and simulation results suggest specific experiments for testing the validity of the two models.",

        "Abstract": "Numerous studies suggest that the visual system uses both phase- and position-shift receptive field (RF) mechanisms for the processing of binocular disparity. Although the difference between these two mechanisms has been analyzed before, previous work mainly focused on disparity tuning curves instead of population responses. However, tuning curve and population response can exhibit different characteristics, and it is the latter that determines disparity estimation. Here we demonstrate, in the framework of the disparity energy model, that for relatively small disparities, the population response generated by the phase-shift mechanism is more reliable than that generated by the position-shift mechanism. This is true over a wide range of parameters, including the RF orientation. Since the phase model has its own drawbacks of underestimating large stimulus disparity and covering only a restricted range of disparity at a given scale, we propose a coarse-to-fine algorithm for disparity computation with a hybrid of phase-shift and position-shift components. In this algorithm, disparity at each scale is always estimated by the phase-shift mechanism to take advantage of its higher reliability. Since the phase-based estimation is most accurate at the smallest scale when the disparity is correspondingly small, the algorithm iteratively reduces the input disparity from coarse to fine scales by introducing a constant position-shift component to all cells for a given location in order to offset the stimulus disparity at that location. The model also incorporates orientation pooling and spatial pooling to further enhance reliability. We have tested the algorithm on both synthetic and natural stereo images and found that it often performs better than a simple scale-averaging procedure.",

        "Title": "Learning motion discrimination with suppressed MT.",
        "Abstract": "We studied perceptual learning in motion discrimination when the brain's middle temporal area (MT/V5) was functionally suppressed. This was achieved by using the \"paired-dots\" motion stimulus where the two dots in a pair always move in counter-phase over a short distance [J. Neurosci. 14 (1994) 7357]. The motion directional signal of the stimulus is therefore always 0 on average. As a result, this stimulus activates MT in Rhesus monkeys no more than flicker noise does [J. Neurosci. 14 (1994) 7367]. We added a new manipulation to eliminate the Glass pattern in the original stimulus that would have otherwise provided a static orientation cue. Two such new motion stimuli were presented sequentially, in a 2AFC task. Subjects decided if the global motion-axis of the stimuli changed clockwise or counter-clockwise. When the task difficulty was set at 60% correct, none of the subjects could learn with feedback, even though their performance was well above chance. However, when the task difficulty was set instead at 70% correct, a new group of subjects was able to learn. Hence, learning motion discrimination was possible when MT was presumably eliminated.",

        "Abstract": "There is an ongoing debate on whether binocular rivalry involves competition among monocular cells or binocular cells. We investigated this issue psychophysically with two specially designed test stimuli. One test stimulus contained monocular motion signals but greatly reduced binocular motion signals, while the other contained binocular motion signals but no monocular motion signals. For comparison, we also employed a normal rivalrous control containing both monocular and binocular motion signals, and a non-rivalrous flicker-noise control with neither monocular nor binocular motion signals. We found that binocular rivalry for the two test stimuli was significantly reduced compared with the normal rivalrous control, but not completely eliminated compared with the non-rivalrous control. Therefore, both monocular and binocular motion signals appear to contribute to motion rivalry, suggesting that motion rivalry must involve competition among both monocular and binocular cells.",

        "Abstract": "A momentum term is usually included in the simulations of connectionist learning algorithms. Although it is well known that such a term greatly improves the speed of learning, there have been few rigorous studies of its mechanisms. In this paper, I show that in the limit of continuous time, the momentum parameter is analogous to the mass of Newtonian particles that move through a viscous medium in a conservative force field. The behavior of the system near a local minimum is equivalent to a set of coupled and damped harmonic oscillators. The momentum term improves the speed of convergence by bringing some eigen components of the system closer to critical damping. Similar results can be obtained for the discrete time case used in computer simulations. In particular, I derive the bounds for convergence on learning-rate and momentum parameters, and demonstrate that the momentum term can increase the range of learning rate over which the system converges. The optimal condition for convergence is also analyzed.",

        "Abstract": "Learning and adaptation in the domain of orientation processing are among the most studied topics in the literature. However, little effort has been devoted to explaining the diverse array of experimental findings via a physiologically based model. We have started to address this issue in the framework of the recurrent model of V1 orientation selectivity and found that reported changes in V1 orientation tuning curves after learning and adaptation can both be explained with the model. Specifically, the sharpening of orientation tuning curves near the trained orientation after learning can be accounted for by slightly reducing net excitatory connections to cells around the trained orientation, while the broadening and peak shift of the tuning curves after adaptation can be reproduced by appropriately scaling down both excitation and inhibition around the adapted orientation. In addition, we investigated the perceptual consequences of the tuning curve changes induced by learning and adaptation using signal detection theory. We found that in the case of learning, the physiological changes can account for the psychophysical data well. In the case of adaptation, however, there is a clear discrepancy between the psychophysical data from alert human subjects and the physiological data from anesthetized animals. Instead, human adaptation studies can be better accounted for by the learning data from behaving animals. Our work suggests that adaptation in behaving subjects may be viewed as a short-term form of learning.",

        "Abstract": "It has been known since the time of Helmholtz that vertical differences between the two retinal images can generate depth perception. Although many ecologically and geometrically inspired theories have been proposed, the neural mechanisms underlying the phenomenon remain elusive. Here we propose a new theory for depth perception from vertical disparity based on the oriented binocular receptive fields of visual cortical cells and on the radial bias of the preferred-orientation distribution in the cortex. The theory suggests that oriented cells may treat a vertical disparity as a weaker, equivalent horizontal disparity. It explains the induced effect, and the quadrant and size dependence of vertical disparity. It predicts that horizontal and vertical disparities should locally enhance or cancel each other according to their depth signs, and that the effect of vertical disparity should be orientation dependent. These predictions were confirmed through psychophysical experiments.",

        "Abstract": "Recent psychophysical experiments suggest that humans can recover only relief structure from motion (SFM); i.e., an object's 3D shape can only be determined up to a stretching transformation along the line of sight. Here we propose a physiologically plausible model for the computation of relief SFM, which is also applicable to the related problem of motion parallax. We assume that the perception of depth from motion is related to the firing of a subset of MT neurons tuned to both velocity and disparity. The model MT neurons are connected to each other laterally to form modulatory interactions. The overall connectivity is such that when a zero-disparity velocity pattern is fed into the system, the most responsive neurons are not those tuned to zero disparity, but instead are those having preferred disparities consistent with the relief structure of the velocity pattern. The model computes the correct relief structure under a wide range of parameters and can also reproduce the SFM illusions involving coaxial cylinders. It is consistent with the psychophysical observation that subjects with stereo impairment are also deficient in perceiving motion parallax, and with the physiological data that the responses of direction- and disparity-tuned MT cells covary with the perceived surface order of bistable SFM stimuli.",

Here we propose, from the perspective of classical signal detection theory, a simple and general model to elucidate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon. We demonstrate that noise-mediated enhancements and decrements in human sensation can be well reproduced by our model. The predicted upper bound of the performance improvement by adding noise is also consistent with the experimental data. We suggest additional experiments to further test the model.",
