        "Title": "ADTnorm: Robust Integration of Single-cell Protein Measurement across CITE-seq Datasets.",
        "Abstract": "CITE-seq enables paired measurement of surface protein and mRNA expression in single cells using antibodies conjugated to oligonucleotide tags. Due to the high copy number of surface protein molecules, sequencing antibody-derived tags (ADTs) allows for robust protein detection, improving cell-type identification. However, variability in antibody staining leads to batch effects in the ADT expression, obscuring biological variation, reducing interpretability, and obstructing cross-study analyses. Here, we present ADTnorm (https://github.com/yezhengSTAT/ADTnorm), a normalization and integration method designed explicitly for ADT abundance. Benchmarking against 14 existing scaling and normalization methods, we show that ADTnorm accurately aligns populations with negative- and positive-expression of surface protein markers across 13 public datasets, effectively removing technical variation across batches and improving cell-type separation. ADTnorm enables efficient integration of public CITE-seq datasets, each with unique experimental designs, paving the way for atlas-level analyses. Beyond normalization, ADTnorm includes built-in utilities to aid in automated threshold-gating as well as assessment of antibody staining quality for titration optimization and antibody panel selection. Applying ADTnorm to a published COVID-19 CITE-seq dataset allowed for identifying previously undetected disease-associated markers, illustrating a broad utility in biological applications.",

        "Abstract": "While mitotic spindle inhibitors specifically kill proliferating tumor cells without the toxicities of microtubule poisons, resistance has limited their clinical utility. Treating glioblastomas with the spindle inhibitors ispinesib, alisertib, or volasertib creates a subpopulation of therapy induced senescent cells that resist these drugs by relying upon the anti-apoptotic and metabolic effects of activated STAT3. Furthermore, these senescent cells expand the repertoire of cells resistant to these drugs by secreting an array of factors, including TGF\u03b2, which induce proliferating cells to exit mitosis and become quiescent-a state that also resists spindle inhibitors. Targeting STAT3 restores sensitivity to each of these drugs by depleting the senescent subpopulation and inducing quiescent cells to enter the mitotic cycle. These results support a therapeutic strategy of targeting STAT3-dependent therapy-induced senescence to enhance the efficacy of spindle inhibitors for the treatment of glioblastoma.",

        "Abstract": "During ontogeny, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells emerge from the thymus and directly seed peripheral tissues for in situ immunity. However, their functional role in humans has largely been defined from blood. Here, we analyzed the phenotype, transcriptome, function, and repertoire of human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in blood and mucosal and lymphoid tissues from 176 donors across the life span, revealing distinct profiles in children compared with adults. In early life, clonally diverse V\u03b41 subsets predominate across blood and tissues, comprising na\u00efve and differentiated effector and tissue repair functions, whereas cytolytic V\u03b42 subsets populate blood, spleen, and lungs. With age, V\u03b41 and V\u03b42 subsets exhibit clonal expansions and elevated cytolytic signatures, which are disseminated across sites. In adults, V\u03b42 cells predominate in blood, whereas V\u03b41 cells are enriched across tissues and express residency profiles. Thus, antigenic exposures over childhood drive the functional evolution and tissue compartmentalization of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, leading to age-dependent roles in immunity.",

        "Abstract": "Tumors frequently harbor isogenic yet epigenetically distinct subpopulations of multi-potent cells with high tumor-initiating potential-often called Cancer Stem-Like Cells (CSLCs). These can display preferential resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapy. Single-cell analyses can help elucidate Master Regulator (MR) proteins responsible for governing the transcriptional state of these cells, thus revealing complementary dependencies that may be leveraged via combination therapy. Interrogation of single-cell RNA sequencing profiles from seven metastatic breast cancer patients, using perturbational profiles of clinically relevant drugs, identified drugs predicted to invert the activity of MR proteins governing the transcriptional state of chemoresistant CSLCs, which were then validated by CROP-seq assays. The top drug, the anthelmintic albendazole, depleted this subpopulation ",

        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a deadly brain tumor, and the kinesin motor KIF11 is an attractive therapeutic target with roles in proliferation and invasion. Resistance to KIF11 inhibitors, which has mainly been studied in animal models, presents significant challenges. We use lineage-tracing barcodes and single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze resistance in patient-derived GBM neurospheres treated with ispinesib, a potent KIF11 inhibitor. Similar to GBM progression in patients, untreated cells lose their neural lineage identity and become mesenchymal, which is associated with poor prognosis. Conversely, cells subjected to long-term ispinesib treatment exhibit a proneural phenotype. We generate patient-derived xenografts and show that ispinesib-resistant cells form less aggressive tumors in\u00a0vivo, even in the absence of drug. Moreover, treatment of human ex\u00a0vivo GBM slices with ispinesib demonstrates phenotypic alignment with in\u00a0vitro responses, underscoring the clinical relevance of our findings. Finally, using retrospective lineage tracing, we identify drugs that are synergistic with ispinesib.",

        "Title": "Glioma-Induced Alterations in Excitatory Neurons are Reversed by mTOR Inhibition.",
        "Abstract": "Gliomas are highly aggressive brain tumors characterized by poor prognosis and composed of diffusely infiltrating tumor cells that intermingle with non-neoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment, including neurons. Neurons are increasingly appreciated as important reactive components of the glioma microenvironment, due to their role in causing hallmark glioma symptoms, such as cognitive deficits and seizures, as well as their potential ability to drive glioma progression. Separately, mTOR signaling has been shown to have pleiotropic effects in the brain tumor microenvironment, including regulation of neuronal hyperexcitability. However, the local cellular-level effects of mTOR inhibition on glioma-induced neuronal alterations are not well understood. Here we employed neuron-specific profiling of ribosome-bound mRNA via 'RiboTag,' morphometric analysis of dendritic spines, and in vivo calcium imaging, along with pharmacological mTOR inhibition to investigate the impact of glioma burden and mTOR inhibition on these neuronal alterations. The RiboTag analysis of tumor-associated excitatory neurons showed a downregulation of transcripts encoding excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic proteins and dendritic spine development, and an upregulation of transcripts encoding cytoskeletal proteins involved in dendritic spine turnover. Light and electron microscopy of tumor-associated excitatory neurons demonstrated marked decreases in dendritic spine density. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging in tumor-associated excitatory neurons revealed progressive alterations in neuronal activity, both at the population and single-neuron level, throughout tumor growth. This in vivo calcium imaging also revealed altered stimulus-evoked somatic calcium events, with changes in event rate, size, and temporal alignment to stimulus, which was most pronounced in neurons with high-tumor burden. A single acute dose of AZD8055, a combined mTORC1/2 inhibitor, reversed the glioma-induced alterations on the excitatory neurons, including the alterations in ribosome-bound transcripts, dendritic spine density, and stimulus evoked responses seen by calcium imaging. These results point to mTOR-driven pathological plasticity in neurons at the infiltrative margin of glioma - manifested by alterations in ribosome-bound mRNA, dendritic spine density, and stimulus-evoked neuronal activity. Collectively, our work identifies the pathological changes that tumor-associated excitatory neurons experience as both hyperlocal and reversible under the influence of mTOR inhibition, providing a foundation for developing therapies targeting neuronal signaling in glioma.",

        "Abstract": "The immune system comprises multiple cell lineages and heterogeneous subsets found in blood and tissues throughout the body. While human immune responses differ between sites and over age, the underlying sources of variation remain unclear as most studies are limited to peripheral blood. Here, we took a systems approach to comprehensively profile RNA and surface protein expression of over 1.25 million immune cells isolated from blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissues of 24 organ donors aged 20-75 years. We applied a multimodal classifier to annotate the major immune cell lineages (T cells, B cells, innate lymphoid cells, and myeloid cells) and their corresponding subsets across the body, leveraging probabilistic modeling to define bases for immune variations across donors, tissue, and age. We identified dominant tissue-specific effects on immune cell composition and function across lineages for lymphoid sites, intestines, and blood-rich tissues. Age-associated effects were intrinsic to both lineage and site as manifested by macrophages in mucosal sites, B cells in lymphoid organs, and T and NK cells in blood-rich sites. Our results reveal tissue-specific signatures of immune homeostasis throughout the body and across different ages. This information provides a basis for defining the transcriptional underpinnings of immune variation and potential associations with disease-associated immune pathologies across the human lifespan.",

        "Abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomic analyses now frequently involve elaborate study designs including samples from multiple individuals, experimental conditions, perturbations, and batches from complex tissues. Dimensionality reduction is required to facilitate integration, interpretation, and statistical analysis. However, these datasets often include subtly different cellular subpopulations or state transitions, which are poorly described by clustering. We previously reported a Bayesian matrix factorization algorithm called single-cell hierarchical Poisson factorization (scHPF) that identifies gene co-expression patterns directly from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) count matrices while accounting for transcript drop-out and noise. Here, we describe consensus scHPF, which analyzes scHPF models from multiple random initializations to identify the most robust gene signatures and automatically determine the number of factors for a given dataset. Consensus scHPF facilitates integration of complex datasets with highly multi-modal posterior distributions, resulting in factors that can be uniformly analyzed across individuals and conditions. To demonstrate the utility of consensus scHPF, we performed a meta-analysis of a large-scale scRNA-seq dataset from drug-treated, human glioma slice cultures generated from surgical specimens across three major cell types, 19 patients, 10 drug treatment conditions, and 52 samples. In addition to recapitulating previously reported cell type-specific drug responses from smaller studies, consensus scHPF identified disparate effects of the topoisomerase poisons etoposide and topotecan that are highly consistent with the distinct roles and expression patterns of their respective protein targets.",

        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor, and resection is a key part of the standard of care. In fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS), fluorophores differentiate tumor tissue from surrounding normal brain. The heme synthesis pathway converts 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), a fluorogenic substrate used for FGS, to fluorescent protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). The resulting fluorescence is believed to be specific to neoplastic glioma cells, but this specificity has not been examined at a single-cell level. The objective of this study was to determine the specificity with which 5-ALA labels the diversity of cell types in GBM.",

The clinical utility of KIF11 inhibitors has been limited by drug resistance, which has mainly been studied in animal models. We used multiplexed lineage tracing barcodes and scRNA-seq to analyze drug resistance time courses for patient-derived GBM neurospheres treated with ispinesib, a potent KIF11 inhibitor. Similar to GBM progression in patients, untreated cells lost their neural lineage identity and transitioned to a mesenchymal phenotype, which is associated with poor prognosis. In contrast, cells subjected to long-term ispinesib treatment exhibited a proneural phenotype. We generated patient-derived xenografts to show that ispinesib-resistant cells form less aggressive tumors ",

        "Abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is invaluable for profiling cellular heterogeneity and dissecting transcriptional states, but transcriptomic profiles do not always delineate subsets defined by surface proteins, as in cells of the immune system. Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes (CITE-seq) enables simultaneous profiling of single-cell transcriptomes and surface proteomes; however, accurate cell type annotation requires a classifier that integrates multimodal data. Here, we describe MultiModal Classifier Hierarchy (MMoCHi), a marker-based approach for classification, reconciling gene and protein expression without reliance on reference atlases. We benchmark MMoCHi using sorted T lymphocyte subsets and annotate a cross-tissue human immune cell dataset. MMoCHi outperforms leading transcriptome-based classifiers and multimodal unsupervised clustering in its ability to identify immune cell subsets that are not readily resolved and to reveal novel subset markers. MMoCHi is designed for adaptability and can integrate annotation of cell types and developmental states across diverse lineages, samples, or modalities.",

        "Abstract": "Infancy and childhood are critical life stages for generating immune memory to protect against pathogens; however, the timing, location, and pathways for memory development in humans remain elusive. Here, we investigated T\u00a0cells in mucosal sites, lymphoid tissues, and blood from 96 pediatric donors aged 0-10 years using phenotypic, functional, and transcriptomic profiling. Our results revealed that memory T\u00a0cells preferentially localized in the intestines and lungs during infancy and accumulated more rapidly in mucosal sites compared with blood and lymphoid organs, consistent with site-specific antigen exposure. Early life mucosal memory T\u00a0cells exhibit distinct functional capacities and stem-like transcriptional profiles. In later childhood, they progressively adopt proinflammatory functions and tissue-resident signatures, coincident with increased T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion in mucosal and lymphoid sites. Together, our findings identify staged development of memory T\u00a0cells targeted to tissues during the formative years, informing how we might promote and monitor immunity in children.",

        "Abstract": "The RNA-binding protein LIN28B is overexpressed in over 30% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and is associated with poor prognosis. In the present study, we unraveled a potentially novel mechanism by which LIN28B regulates colonic epithelial cell-cell junctions and CRC metastasis. Using human CRC cells (DLD-1, Caco-2, and LoVo) with either knockdown or overexpression of LIN28B, we identified claudin 1 (CLDN1) tight junction protein as a direct downstream target and effector of LIN28B. RNA immunoprecipitation revealed that LIN28B directly binds to and posttranscriptionally regulates CLDN1 mRNA. Furthermore, using in vitro assays and a potentially novel murine model of metastatic CRC, we show that LIN28B-mediated CLDN1 expression enhances collective invasion, cell migration, and metastatic liver tumor formation. Bulk RNA sequencing of the metastatic liver tumors identified NOTCH3 as a downstream effector of the LIN28B/CLDN1 axis. Additionally, genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of NOTCH3 signaling revealed that NOTCH3 was necessary for invasion and metastatic liver tumor formation. In summary, our results suggest that LIN28B promotes invasion and liver metastasis of CRC by posttranscriptionally regulating CLDN1 and activating NOTCH3 signaling. This discovery offers a promising new therapeutic option for metastatic CRC to the liver, an area where therapeutic advancements have been relatively scarce.",

        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) diffusely infiltrates the brain and intermingles with non-neoplastic brain cells, including astrocytes, neurons and microglia/myeloid cells. This complex mixture of cell types forms the biological context for therapeutic response and tumor recurrence. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to determine the cellular composition and transcriptional states in primary and recurrent glioma and identified three compositional 'tissue-states' defined by cohabitation patterns between specific subpopulations of neoplastic and non-neoplastic brain cells. These tissue-states correlated with radiographic, histopathologic, and prognostic features and were enriched in distinct metabolic pathways. Fatty acid biosynthesis was enriched in the tissue-state defined by the cohabitation of astrocyte-like/mesenchymal glioma cells, reactive astrocytes, and macrophages, and was associated with recurrent GBM and shorter survival. Treating acute slices of GBM with a fatty acid synthesis inhibitor depleted the transcriptional signature of this pernicious tissue-state. These findings point to therapies that target interdependencies in the GBM microenvironment.",

        "Abstract": "Dysregulated inflammation within the central nervous system (CNS) contributes to neuropathology in infectious, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disease. With the exception of microglia, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins are virtually undetectable in the mature, healthy central nervous system (CNS). Neurons have generally been considered incapable of antigen presentation, and although interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) can elicit neuronal MHC class I (MHC-I) expression and antigen presentation in vitro, it has been unclear whether similar responses occur in vivo. Here we directly injected IFN-\u03b3 into the ventral midbrain of mature mice and analyzed gene expression profiles of specific CNS cell types. We found that IFN-\u03b3 upregulated MHC-I and associated mRNAs in ventral midbrain microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and GABAergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic neurons. The core set of IFN-\u03b3-induced genes and their response kinetics were similar in neurons and glia, but with a lower amplitude of expression in neurons. A diverse repertoire of genes was upregulated in glia, particularly microglia, which were the only cells to undergo cellular proliferation and express MHC classII (MHC-II) and associated genes. To determine if neurons respond directly via cell-autonomous IFN-\u03b3 receptor (IFNGR) signaling, we produced mutant mice with a deletion of the IFN-\u03b3-binding domain of IFNGR1 in dopaminergic neurons, which resulted in a complete loss of dopaminergic neuronal responses to IFN-\u03b3. Our results demonstrate that IFN-\u03b3 induces neuronal IFNGR signaling and upregulation of MHC-I and related genes in vivo, although the expression level is low compared to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia.",

        "Abstract": "Predicting in vivo response to antineoplastics remains an elusive challenge. We performed a first-of-kind evaluation of two transcriptome-based precision cancer medicine methodologies to predict tumor sensitivity to a comprehensive repertoire of clinically relevant oncology drugs, whose mechanism of action we experimentally assessed in cognate cell lines. We enrolled patients with histologically distinct, poor-prognosis malignancies who had progressed on multiple therapies, and developed low-passage, patient-derived xenograft models that were used to validate 35 patient-specific drug predictions. Both OncoTarget, which identifies high-affinity inhibitors of individual master regulator (MR) proteins, and OncoTreat, which identifies drugs that invert the transcriptional activity of hyperconnected MR modules, produced highly significant 30-day disease control rates (68% and 91%, respectively). Moreover, of 18 OncoTreat-predicted drugs, 15 induced the predicted MR-module activity inversion in vivo. Predicted drugs significantly outperformed antineoplastic drugs selected as unpredicted controls, suggesting these methods may substantively complement existing precision cancer medicine approaches, as also illustrated by a case study.",

        "Abstract": "Glioma cells hijack developmental transcriptional programs to control cell state. During neural development, lineage trajectories rely on specialized metabolic pathways. However, the link between tumor cell state and metabolic programs is poorly understood in glioma. Here we uncover a glioma cell state-specific metabolic liability that can be leveraged therapeutically. To model cell state diversity, we generated genetically engineered murine gliomas, induced by deletion of p53 alone (p53) or with constitutively active Notch signaling (N1IC), a pathway critical in controlling cellular fate. N1IC tumors harbored quiescent astrocyte-like transformed cell states while p53 tumors were predominantly comprised of proliferating progenitor-like cell states. N1IC cells exhibit distinct metabolic alterations, with mitochondrial uncoupling and increased ROS production rendering them more sensitive to inhibition of the lipid hydroperoxidase GPX4 and induction of ferroptosis. Importantly, treating patient-derived organotypic slices with a GPX4 inhibitor induced selective depletion of quiescent astrocyte-like glioma cell populations with similar metabolic profiles.",

        "Abstract": "The ideal technology for directly investigating the relationship between genotype and phenotype would analyze both RNA and DNA genome-wide and with single-cell resolution. However, existing tools lack the throughput required for comprehensive analysis of complex tumors and tissues. We introduce a highly scalable method for jointly profiling DNA and expression following nucleosome depletion (DEFND-seq). In DEFND-seq, nuclei are nucleosome-depleted, tagmented, and separated into individual droplets for mRNA and genomic DNA barcoding. Once nuclei have been depleted of nucleosomes, subsequent steps can be performed using the widely available 10x Genomics droplet microfluidic technology and commercial kits without experimental modification. We demonstrate the production of high-complexity mRNA and gDNA sequencing libraries from thousands of individual nuclei from both cell lines and archived surgical specimens for associating gene expression phenotypes with both copy number and single nucleotide variants.",

Systemic delivery is limited by toxicity and insufficient brain penetrance, and, to date, convection-enhanced delivery (CED) has been restricted to a single treatment of restricted duration. To address this problem, we engineered a subcutaneously implanted catheter-pump system capable of repeated, chronic (prolonged, pulsatile) CED of topotecan into the brain and tested its safety and biological effects in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.",

        "Abstract": "Inhibitors of the mitotic kinesin Kif11 are anti-mitotics that, unlike vinca alkaloids or taxanes, do not disrupt microtubules and are not neurotoxic. However, development of resistance has limited their clinical utility. While resistance to Kif11 inhibitors in other cell types is due to mechanisms that prevent these drugs from disrupting mitosis, we find that in glioblastoma (GBM), resistance to the Kif11 inhibitor ispinesib works instead through suppression of apoptosis driven by activation of STAT3. This form of resistance requires dual phosphorylation of STAT3 residues Y705 and S727, mediated by SRC and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), respectively. Simultaneously inhibiting SRC and EGFR reverses this resistance, and combined targeting of these two kinases in\u00a0vivo with clinically available inhibitors is synergistic and significantly prolongs survival in ispinesib-treated GBM-bearing mice. We thus identify a translationally actionable approach to overcoming Kif11 inhibitor resistance that may work to block STAT3-driven resistance against other anti-cancer therapies as well.",

        "Abstract": "Respiratory failure in COVID-19 is characterized by widespread disruption of the lung's alveolar gas exchange interface. To elucidate determinants of alveolar lung damage, we performed epithelial and immune cell profiling in lungs from 24 COVID-19 autopsies and 43 uninfected organ donors ages 18-92 years. We found marked loss of type 2 alveolar epithelial (T2AE) cells and increased perialveolar lymphocyte cytotoxicity in all fatal COVID-19 cases, even at early stages before typical patterns of acute lung injury are histologically apparent. In lungs from uninfected organ donors, there was also progressive loss of T2AE cells with increasing age, which may increase susceptibility to COVID-19-mediated lung damage in older individuals. In the fatal COVID-19 cases, macrophage infiltration differed according to the histopathological pattern of lung injury. In cases with acute lung injury, we found accumulation of CD4+ macrophages that expressed distinctly high levels of T cell activation and costimulation genes and strongly correlated with increased extent of alveolar epithelial cell depletion and CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. Together, our results show that T2AE cell deficiency may underlie age-related COVID-19 risk and initiate alveolar dysfunction shortly after infection, and we define immune cell mediators that may contribute to alveolar injury in distinct pathological stages of fatal COVID-19.",

Here we present riboPLATE-seq, a scalable method for generating paired libraries of ribosome-associated and total mRNA. As an extension of the PLATE-seq protocol, riboPLATE-seq utilizes barcoded primers for pooled library preparation, but additionally leverages anti-rRNA ribosome immunoprecipitation on whole polysomes to measure ribosome association (RA). We compare RA to its analogue in ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing, translation efficiency, and demonstrate both the performance of riboPLATE-seq and its utility in detecting translational alterations induced by specific inhibitors of protein kinases.",

        "Abstract": "Intestinal ganglionic cells in the adult enteric nervous system (ENS) are continually exposed to stimuli from the surrounding microenvironment and need at times to respond to disturbed homeostasis following acute intestinal injury. The kinase DCLK1 and intestinal Dclk1-positive cells have been reported to contribute to intestinal regeneration. Although Dclk1-positive cells are present in adult enteric ganglia, their cellular identity and response to acute injury have not been investigated in detail. Here, we reveal the presence of distinct Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b+ glial-like and Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b- neuronal cell types in adult myenteric ganglia. These ganglionic cells demonstrate distinct patterns of tracing over time yet show a similar expansion in response to elevated serotonergic signaling. Interestingly, Dclk1-tdTom+ glial-like and neuronal cell types appear resistant to acute irradiation injury-mediated cell death. Moreover, Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b+ glial-like cells show prominent changes in gene expression profiles induced by injury, in contrast to Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b- neuronal cell types. Finally, subsets of Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b+ glial-like cells demonstrate prominent overlap with Nestin and p75NTR and strong responses to elevated serotonergic signaling or acute injury. These findings, together with their role in early development and their neural crest-like gene expression signature, suggest the presence of reserve progenitor cells in the adult ",

        "Abstract": "Acute cellular rejection is common after lung transplantation and is associated with an increased risk of early chronic rejection. We present combined single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing on recipient-derived T cells obtained from the bronchoalveolar lavage of three lung transplant recipients with rejection and compare them with T cells obtained from the same patients after treatment of rejection with high-dose systemic glucocorticoids. At the time of rejection, we found an oligoclonal expansion of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that all persisted as tissue resident memory T cells after successful treatment. Persisting CD8+ allograft-resident T cells have reduced gene expression for cytotoxic mediators after therapy with glucocorticoids but accumulate around airways. This clonal expansion is discordant with circulating T cell clonal expansion at the time of rejection, suggesting in situ expansion. We thus highlight the accumulation of cytotoxic, recipient-derived tissue resident memory T cells within the lung allograft that persist despite the administration of high-dose systemic glucocorticoids. The long-term clinical consequences of this persistence have yet to be characterized.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) correlate with T cell infiltrates, but the specific contributions of heterogenous T cell types remain unclear. To investigate the diverse function of T cells in CRC, we profiled 37,931 T cells from tumors and adjacent normal colon of 16 patients with CRC with respect to transcriptome, TCR sequence, and cell surface markers. Our analysis identified phenotypically and functionally distinguishable effector T cell types. We employed single-cell gene signatures from these T cell subsets to query the TCGA database to assess their prognostic significance. We found 2 distinct cytotoxic T cell types. GZMK+KLRG1+ cytotoxic T cells were enriched in CRC patients with good outcomes. GNLY+CD103+ cytotoxic T cells with a dysfunctional phenotype were not associated with good outcomes, despite coexpression of CD39 and CD103, markers that denote tumor reactivity. We found 2 distinct Treg subtypes associated with opposite outcomes. While total Tregs were associated with good outcomes, CD38+ Tregs were associated with bad outcomes independently of stage and possessed a highly suppressive phenotype, suggesting that they inhibit antitumor immunity in CRC. These findings highlight the potential utility of these subpopulations in predicting outcomes and support the potential for novel therapies directed at CD38+ Tregs or CD8+CD103+ T cells.",

        "Abstract": "Only a subset of recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) responds to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Previously, we reported enrichment of BRAF/PTPN11 mutations in 30% of rGBM that responded to PD-1 blockade. Given that BRAF and PTPN11 promote MAPK/ERK signaling, we investigated whether activation of this pathway is associated with response to PD-1 inhibitors in rGBM, including patients that do not harbor BRAF/PTPN11 mutations. Here we show that immunohistochemistry for ERK1/2 phosphorylation (p-ERK), a marker of MAPK/ERK pathway activation, is predictive of overall survival following adjuvant PD-1 blockade in two independent rGBM patient cohorts. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and multiplex immunofluorescence analyses revealed that p-ERK was mainly localized in tumor cells and that high-p-ERK GBMs contained tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells and microglia with elevated expression of MHC class\u2009II and associated genes. These findings indicate that ERK1/2 activation in rGBM is predictive of response to PD-1 blockade and is associated with a distinct myeloid cell phenotype.",

        "Abstract": "To control sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial Notch signaling suppresses tip cell formation, migration, and proliferation while promoting barrier formation. Each of these responses may be regulated by distinct Notch-regulated effectors. Notch activity is highly dynamic in sprouting endothelial cells, while constitutive Notch signaling drives homeostatic endothelial polarization, indicating the need for both rapid and constitutive Notch targets. In contrast to previous screens that focus on genes regulated by constitutively active Notch, we characterized the dynamic response to Notch. We examined transcriptional changes from 1.5 to 6\u00a0h after Notch signal activation via ligand-specific or EGTA induction in cultured primary human endothelial cells and neonatal mouse brain. In each combination of endothelial type and Notch manipulation, transcriptomic analysis identified distinct but overlapping sets of rapidly regulated genes and revealed many novel Notch target genes. Among the novel Notch-regulated signaling pathways identified were effectors in GPCR signaling, notably, the constitutively active GTPase RND1. In endothelial cells, RND1 was shown to be a novel direct Notch transcriptional target and required for Notch control of sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial migration, and Ras activity. We conclude that RND1 is directly regulated by endothelial Notch signaling in a rapid fashion in order to suppress endothelial migration.",

        "Abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons modulate neural circuits and behaviors via dopamine (DA) release from expansive, long range axonal projections. The elaborate cytoarchitecture of these neurons is embedded within complex brain tissue, making it difficult to access the neuronal proteome using conventional methods. Here, we demonstrate APEX2 proximity labeling within genetically targeted neurons in the mouse brain, enabling subcellular proteomics with cell-type specificity. By combining APEX2 biotinylation with mass spectrometry, we mapped the somatodendritic and axonal proteomes of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Our dataset reveals the proteomic architecture underlying proteostasis, axonal metabolism, and neurotransmission in these neurons. We find that most proteins encoded by DA neuron-enriched genes are localized within striatal dopaminergic axons, including ion channels with previously undescribed axonal localization. These proteomic datasets provide a resource for neuronal cell biology, and this approach can be readily adapted for study of other neural cell types.",

        "Abstract": "Macrophages are resident myeloid cells in the gingival tissue which control homeostasis and play a pivotal role in orchestrating the immune response in periodontitis. Cell heterogeneity and functional phenotypes of macrophage subpopulations in periodontitis remain elusive. Here, we isolated gingival tissue from periodontitis-affected and healthy sites of patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We then used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define the heterogeneity of tissue-resident macrophages in gingival tissue in health vs. periodontitis. scRNA-seq demonstrated an unforeseen gene expression heterogeneity among macrophages in periodontitis and showed transcriptional and signaling heterogeneity of identified subsets in an independent cohort of patients with periodontitis and T2DM. Our bioinformatic inferences indicated divergent expression profiles in macrophages driven by transcriptional regulators CIITA, RELA, RFX5, and RUNX2. Macrophages in periodontitis expressed both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers and their polarization was not mutually exclusive. The majority of macrophages in periodontitis expressed the monocyte lineage marker CD14, indicating their bone marrow lineage. We also found high expression and activation of RELA, a subunit of the NF-\u03baB transcription factor complex, in gingival macrophages of periodontitis patients with T2DM. Our data suggested that heterogeneity and hyperinflammatory activation of macrophages may be relevant to the pathogenesis and outcomes of periodontitis, and may be further augmented in patients with T2DM.",

        "Abstract": "Midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons exhibit extensive dendritic and axonal arborizations, but local protein synthesis is not characterized in these neurons. Here, we investigate messenger RNA (mRNA) localization and translation in mDA neuronal axons and dendrites, both of which release dopamine (DA). Using highly sensitive ribosome-bound RNA sequencing and imaging approaches, we find no evidence for mRNA translation in mDA axons. In contrast, mDA neuronal dendrites in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) contain ribosomes and mRNAs encoding the major components of DA synthesis, release, and reuptake machinery. Surprisingly, we also observe dendritic localization of mRNAs encoding synaptic vesicle-related proteins, including those involved in exocytic fusion. Our results are consistent with a role for local translation in the regulation of DA release from dendrites, but not from axons. Our translatome data define a molecular signature of sparse mDA neurons in the SNr, including the enrichment of Atp2a3/SERCA3, an atypical ER calcium pump.",

        "Abstract": "We report that atypical protein kinase C\u03b9 (PKC\u03b9) is an oncogenic driver of glioblastoma (GBM). Deletion or inhibition of PKC\u03b9 significantly impairs tumor growth and prolongs survival in murine GBM models. GBM cells expressing elevated PKC\u03b9 signaling are sensitive to PKC\u03b9 inhibitors, whereas those expressing low PKC\u03b9 signaling exhibit active SRC signaling and sensitivity to SRC inhibitors. Resistance to the PKC\u03b9 inhibitor auranofin is associated with activated SRC signaling and response to a SRC inhibitor, whereas resistance to a SRC inhibitor is associated with activated PKC\u03b9 signaling and sensitivity to auranofin. Interestingly, PKC\u03b9- and SRC-dependent cells often co-exist in individual GBM tumors, and treatment of GBM-bearing mice with combined auranofin and SRC inhibitor prolongs survival beyond either drug alone. Thus, we identify PKC\u03b9 and SRC signaling as distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities that are directly translatable into an improved treatment for GBM.",

        "Abstract": "Knowledge of the development and hierarchical organization of tissues is key to understanding how they are perturbed in injury and disease, as well as how they may be therapeutically manipulated to restore homeostasis. The rapidly regenerating intestinal epithelium harbors diverse cell types and their lineage relationships have been studied using numerous approaches, from classical label-retaining and genetic lineage tracing methods to novel transcriptome-based annotations. Here, we describe the developmental trajectories that dictate differentiation and lineage specification in the intestinal epithelium. We focus on the most recent single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq)-based strategies for understanding intestinal epithelial cell lineage relationships, underscoring how they have refined our view of the development of this tissue and highlighting their advantages and limitations. We emphasize how these technologies have been applied to understand the dynamics of intestinal epithelial cells in homeostatic and injury-induced regeneration models.",

        "Abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are a poorly characterized cell population in the context of liver cancer. Our study investigates CAF functions in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a highly desmoplastic liver tumor. Genetic tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and ligand-receptor analyses uncovered hepatic stellate cells (HSC) as the main source of CAF and HSC-derived CAF as the dominant population interacting with tumor cells. In mice, CAF promotes ICC progression, as revealed by HSC-selective CAF depletion. In patients, a high panCAF signature is associated with decreased survival and increased recurrence. Single-cell RNA sequencing segregates CAF into inflammatory and growth factor-enriched (iCAF) and myofibroblastic (myCAF) subpopulations, displaying distinct ligand-receptor interactions. myCAF-expressed hyaluronan synthase 2, but not type I collagen, promotes ICC. iCAF-expressed hepatocyte growth factor enhances ICC growth via tumor-expressed MET, thus directly linking CAF to tumor cells. In summary, our data demonstrate promotion of desmoplastic ICC growth by therapeutically targetable CAF subtype-specific mediators, but not by type I collagen.",

        "Abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) may exert tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressive functions, but the mechanisms underlying these opposing effects remain elusive. Here, we sought to understand these potentially opposing functions by interrogating functional relationships among CAF subtypes, their mediators, desmoplasia, and tumor growth in a wide range of tumor types metastasizing to the liver, the most common organ site for metastasis. Depletion of hepatic stellate cells (HSC), which represented the main source of CAF in mice and patients in our study, or depletion of all CAF decreased tumor growth and mortality in desmoplastic colorectal and pancreatic metastasis but not in nondesmoplastic metastatic tumors. Single-cell RNA-Seq in conjunction with CellPhoneDB ligand-receptor analysis, as well as studies in immune cell-depleted and HSC-selective knockout mice, uncovered direct CAF-tumor interactions as a tumor-promoting mechanism, mediated by myofibroblastic CAF-secreted (myCAF-secreted) hyaluronan and inflammatory CAF-secreted (iCAF-secreted) HGF. These effects were opposed by myCAF-expressed type I collagen, which suppressed tumor growth by mechanically restraining tumor spread, overriding its own stiffness-induced mechanosignals. In summary, mechanical restriction by type I collagen opposes the overall tumor-promoting effects of CAF, thus providing a mechanistic explanation for their dual functions in cancer. Therapeutic targeting of tumor-promoting CAF mediators while preserving type I collagen may convert CAF from tumor promoting to tumor restricting.",

        "Abstract": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) can rapidly produce interferons and other soluble factors in response to extracellular viruses or virus mimics such as CpG-containing DNA. pDCs can also recognize live cells infected with certain RNA viruses, but the relevance and functional consequences of such recognition remain unclear. We studied the response of primary DCs to the prototypical persistent DNA virus, human cytomegalovirus (CMV). Human pDCs produced high amounts of type I interferon (IFN-I) when incubated with live CMV-infected fibroblasts but not with free CMV; the response involved integrin-mediated adhesion, transfer of DNA-containing virions to pDCs, and the recognition of DNA through TLR9. Compared with transient polyfunctional responses to CpG or free influenza virus, pDC response to CMV-infected cells was long-lasting, dominated by the production of IFN-I and IFN-III, and lacked diversification into functionally distinct populations. Similarly, pDC activation by influenza-infected lung epithelial cells was highly efficient, prolonged, and dominated by interferon production. Prolonged pDC activation by CMV-infected cells facilitated the activation of natural killer cells critical for CMV control. Last, patients with CMV viremia harbored phenotypically activated pDCs and increased circulating IFN-I and IFN-III. Thus, recognition of live infected cells is a mechanism of virus detection by pDCs that elicits a unique antiviral immune response.",

Here, we examined the relationship between immune processes in the respiratory tract and circulation through longitudinal phenotypic, transcriptomic, and cytokine profiling of paired airway and blood samples from patients with severe COVID-19 relative to heathy controls. In COVID-19 airways, T\u00a0cells exhibited activated, tissue-resident, and protective profiles; higher T\u00a0cell frequencies correlated with survival and younger age. Myeloid cells in COVID-19 airways featured hyperinflammatory signatures, and higher frequencies of these cells correlated with mortality and older age. In COVID-19 blood, aberrant CD163",

        "Abstract": "The harsh microenvironment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) exerts strong evolutionary selection pressures on cancer cells. We hypothesize that the poor metabolic conditions near the ductal center foment the emergence of a Warburg Effect (WE) phenotype, wherein cells rapidly ferment glucose to lactic acid, even in normoxia. To test this hypothesis, we subjected low-glycolytic breast cancer cells to different microenvironmental selection pressures using combinations of hypoxia, acidosis, low glucose, and starvation for many months and isolated single clones for metabolic and transcriptomic profiling. The two harshest conditions selected for constitutively expressed WE phenotypes. RNA sequencing analysis of WE clones identified the transcription factor KLF4 as potential inducer of the WE phenotype. In stained DCIS samples, KLF4 expression was enriched in the area with the harshest microenvironmental conditions. We simulated in vivo DCIS phenotypic evolution using a mathematical model calibrated from the in vitro results. The WE phenotype emerged in the poor metabolic conditions near the necrotic core. We propose that harsh microenvironments within DCIS select for a WE phenotype through constitutive transcriptional reprogramming, thus conferring a survival advantage and facilitating further growth and invasion.",

However, existing methods for linking microscopy and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) have limited scalability. Here, we describe an upgraded version of Single Cell Optical Phenotyping and Expression (SCOPE-seq2) for combining single-cell imaging and expression profiling, with substantial improvements in throughput, molecular capture efficiency, linking accuracy, and compatibility with standard microscopy instrumentation. We introduce improved optically decodable mRNA capture beads and implement a more scalable and simplified optical decoding process. We demonstrate the utility of SCOPE-seq2 for fluorescence, morphological, and expression profiling of individual primary cells from a human glioblastoma (GBM) surgical sample, revealing relationships between simple imaging features and cellular identity, particularly among malignantly transformed tumor cells.",

        "Abstract": "Immune responses to respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 originate and function in the lung, yet assessments of human immunity are often limited to blood. Here, we conducted longitudinal, high-dimensional profiling of paired airway and blood samples from patients with severe COVID-19, revealing immune processes in the respiratory tract linked to disease pathogenesis. Survival from severe disease was associated with increased CD4 ",

        "Abstract": "Puromycin is an amino-acyl transfer RNA analog widely employed in studies of protein synthesis. Since puromycin is covalently incorporated into nascent polypeptide chains, anti-puromycin immunofluorescence enables visualization of nascent protein synthesis. A common assumption in studies of local messenger RNA translation is that the anti-puromycin staining of puromycylated nascent polypeptides in fixed cells accurately reports on their original site of translation, particularly when ribosomes are stalled with elongation inhibitors prior to puromycin treatment. However, when we attempted to implement a proximity ligation assay to detect ribosome-puromycin complexes, we found no evidence to support this assumption. We further demonstrated, using biochemical assays and live cell imaging of nascent polypeptides in mammalian cells, that puromycylated nascent polypeptides rapidly dissociate from ribosomes even in the presence of elongation inhibitors. Our results suggest that attempts to define precise subcellular translation sites using anti-puromycin immunostaining may be confounded by release of puromycylated nascent polypeptide chains prior to fixation.",

        "Abstract": "Emerging single-cell technologies, like single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), enable the study of heterogeneous biological systems at cellular resolution. By profiling the set of expressed transcripts in each cell, single-cell transcriptomics has allowed for the cataloging of the cellular constituents of multiple organs and tissues, both in health and disease. In addition, these technologies have provided mechanistic insights into cellular function, cell state transitions, developmental trajectories and lineage relationships, as well as helped to dissect complex, population-level responses to environmental perturbations. scRNA-seq is particularly useful for characterizing the intestinal epithelium because it is a dynamic, rapidly self-renewing tissue comprised of more than a dozen specialized cell types. Here we discuss the fundamentals of single-cell transcriptomics of the murine small intestinal epithelium. We review the principles of proper experimental design and provide methods for the dissociation of the small intestinal epithelium into single cells followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and for scRNA-seq using the 10\u00d7 Genomics Chromium platform.",

        "Abstract": "In the adult ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), neural stem cells (NSCs) generate new olfactory bulb (OB) neurons and glia throughout life. To map adult neuronal lineage progression, we profiled >56,000 V-SVZ and OB cells by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Our analyses reveal the molecular diversity of OB neurons, including fate-mapped neurons, lineage progression dynamics, and an NSC intermediate enriched for Notum, which encodes a secreted WNT antagonist. SCOPE-seq technology, which links live-cell imaging with scRNA-seq, uncovers cell-size transitions during NSC differentiation and preferential NOTUM binding to proliferating neuronal precursors. Consistently, application of NOTUM protein in slice cultures and pharmacological inhibition of NOTUM in slice cultures and in\u00a0vivo demonstrated that NOTUM negatively regulates V-SVZ proliferation. Timely, context-dependent neurogenesis demands adaptive signaling among neighboring progenitors. Our findings highlight a critical regulatory state during NSC activation marked by NOTUM, which attenuates WNT-stimulated proliferation in NSC progeny.",

        "Title": "Gene expression analysis of the cerebellar cortex in essential tremor.",
        "Abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common neurological diseases, with a central feature of an 8-12\u202fHz kinetic tremor. While previous postmortem studies have identified a cluster of morphological changes in the ET cerebellum centered in/around the Purkinje cell (PC) population, including a loss of PCs in some studies, the underlying molecular mechanisms for these changes are not clear. As genomic studies of ET patients have yet to identify major genetic contributors and animal models that fully recapitulate the human disease do not yet exist, the study of human tissue is currently the most applicable method to gain a mechanistic insight into ET disease pathogenesis. To begin exploration of an underlying molecular source of ET disease pathogenesis, we have performed the first transcriptomic analysis by direct sequencing of RNA from frozen cerebellar cortex tissue in 33 ET patients compared to 21 normal controls. Principal component analysis showed a heterogenous distribution of the expression data in ET patients that only partially overlapped with control patients. Differential expression analysis identified 231 differentially expressed gene transcripts ('top gene hits'), a subset of which has defined expression profiles in the cerebellum across neuronal and glial cell types but a largely unknown relationship to cerebellar function and/or ET pathogenesis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified dysregulated pathways of interest and stratified dysregulation among ET cases. By GSEA and mining curated databases, we compiled major categories of dysregulated processes and clustered string networks of known interacting proteins. Here we demonstrate that these 'top gene hits' contribute to regulation of four main biological processes, which are 1) axon guidance, 2) microtubule motor activity, 3) endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport and 4) calcium signaling/synaptic transmission. The results of our transcriptomic analysis suggest there is a range of different processes involved among ET cases, and draws attention to a particular set of genes and regulatory pathways that provide an initial platform to further explore the underlying biology of ET.",

        "Title": "Contextualizing the pathology in the essential tremor cerebellar cortex: a patholog-omics approach.",
        "Abstract": "Several morphological changes, centered in/around Purkinje cells (PCs), have been identified in the cerebellum of essential tremor (ET) patients. These changes have not been contextualized within a broader degenerative disease spectrum, limiting their interpretability. To address this, we compared the severity and patterning of degenerative changes within the cerebellar cortex in patients with ET, other neurodegenerative disorders of the cerebellum (spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), multiple system atrophy (MSA)], and other disorders that may involve the cerebellum [Parkinson's disease (PD), dystonia]. Using a postmortem series of 156 brains [50 ET, 23 SCA (6 SCA3; 17 SCA 1, 2 or 6), 15 MSA, 29 PD, 14 dystonia, 25 controls], we generated data on 37 quantitative morphologic metrics, which were grouped into 8 broad categories: (1) PC loss, (2) heterotopic PCs, (3) PC dendritic changes, (4) PC axonal changes (torpedoes), (5) PC axonal changes (other than torpedoes), (6) PC axonal changes (torpedo-associated), (7) basket cell axonal hypertrophy, (8) climbing fiber-PC synaptic changes. Our analyses used z scored raw data for each metric across all diagnoses (5772 total data items). Principal component analysis revealed that diagnostic groups were not uniform with respect to cerebellar pathology. Dystonia and PD each differed from controls in only 2/37 metrics, whereas ET differed in 21, SCA3 in 8, MSA in 19, and SCA1/2/6 in 26 metrics. Comparing ET with primary disorders of cerebellar degeneration (i.e., SCAs), we observed a spectrum of changes reflecting differences of degree, being generally mild in ET and SCA3 and more severe in SCA1/2/6. Comparative analyses across morphologic categories demonstrated differences in relative expression, defining distinctive patterns of changes in these groups. Thus, the degree of cerebellar degeneration in ET aligns it with a milder end in the spectrum of cerebellar degenerative disorders, and a somewhat distinctive signature of degenerative changes marks each of these disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated sorting are powerful techniques that hold great promise for studying heterogeneous populations of submicron particles such as synaptosomes, but many technical challenges arise in these experiments. To date, most flow cytometry studies of synaptosomes have relied on particle detection using forward scatter (FSC) measurements and size estimation with polystyrene (PS) bead standards. However, these practices have serious limitations, and special care must be taken to overcome the poor sensitivity of conventional flow cytometers in the analysis of submicron particles. Technical artifacts can confound these experiments, especially the detection of multiple particles as a single event. Here, we compared analysis of P2 crude synaptosomal preparations from murine forebrain on multiple flow cytometers using both FSC-triggered and fluorescence-triggered detection. We implemented multicolor fluorescent dye-based assays to quantify coincident particle detection and aggregation, and we assessed the false colocalization of antigens in immunostaining analyses. Our results demonstrate that fluorescence triggering and proper dilution can control for coincident particle detection, but not particle aggregation. We confirmed previous studies showing that FSC-based size estimation with PS beads underestimates biological particle size, and we identified pervasive aggregation in the FSC range analyzed in most synaptosome flow cytometry studies. We found that analyzing P2 samples in sucrose/EDTA/tris (SET) buffer reduces aggregation compared to PBS, but does not completely eliminate the presence of aggregates, especially in immunostaining experiments. Our study highlights challenges and pitfalls in synaptosome flow cytometry and provides a methodological framework for future studies.",

A high burden of tumor-specific mutant peptides (neoantigens) correlates with better survival and response to immunotherapies in selected solid tumors but how neoantigens impact clinical outcome in GBM remains unclear. Here, we exploit the similarity between tumor neoantigens and infectious disease-derived immune epitopes and apply a neoantigen fitness model for identifying high-quality neoantigens in a human pan-glioma dataset.

        "Abstract": "FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein) is a polysome-associated RNA-binding protein encoded by Fmr1 that is lost in fragile X syndrome. Increasing evidence suggests that FMRP regulates both translation initiation and elongation, but the gene specificity of these effects is unclear. To elucidate the impact of\u00a0Fmr1 loss on translation, we utilize ribosome profiling for genome-wide measurements of ribosomal occupancy and positioning in the cortex of 24-day-old Fmr1 knockout mice. We find a remarkably coherent reduction in ribosome footprint abundance per mRNA for previously identified, high-affinity mRNA binding partners of FMRP and an increase for terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif-containing genes canonically controlled by mammalian target of rapamycin-eIF4E-binding protein-eIF4E binding protein-eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (mTOR-4E-BP-eIF4E) signaling. Amino acid motif- and gene-level analyses both show a widespread reduction of translational pausing in Fmr1 knockout mice. Our findings are consistent with a model of FMRP-mediated regulation of both translation initiation through eIF4E and elongation that is disrupted in fragile X\u00a0syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been successful across several tumor types; however, their efficacy has been uncommon and unpredictable in glioblastomas (GBM), where <10% of patients show long-term responses. To understand the molecular determinants of immunotherapeutic response in GBM, we longitudinally profiled 66 patients, including 17 long-term responders, during standard therapy and after treatment with PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab or pembrolizumab). Genomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant enrichment of PTEN mutations associated with immunosuppressive expression signatures in non-responders, and an enrichment of MAPK pathway alterations (PTPN11, BRAF) in responders. Responsive tumors were also associated with branched patterns of evolution from the elimination of neoepitopes as well as with differences in T cell clonal diversity and tumor microenvironment profiles. Our study shows that clinical response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in GBM is associated with specific molecular alterations, immune expression signatures, and immune infiltration that reflect the tumor's clonal evolution during treatment.",

        "Abstract": "The ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) harbors adult neural stem cells. V-SVZ neural stem cells exhibit features of astrocytes, have a regional identity, and depending on their location in the lateral or septal wall of the lateral ventricle, generate different types of neuronal and glial progeny. We performed large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a molecular atlas of cells from the lateral and septal adult V-SVZ of male and female mice. This revealed regional and sex differences among adult V-SVZ cells. We uncovered lineage potency bias at the single-cell level among lateral and septal wall astrocytes toward neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis, respectively. Finally, we identified transcription factor co-expression modules marking key temporal steps in neurogenic and oligodendrocyte lineage progression. Our data suggest functionally important spatial diversity in neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis in the adult brain and reveal molecular correlates of adult NSC dormancy and lineage specialization.",

        "Abstract": "Optically decodable beads link the identity of a sample to a measurement through an optical barcode, enabling libraries of biomolecules to be captured on beads in solution and decoded by fluorescence. This approach has been foundational to microarray, sequencing, and flow-based expression profiling technologies. We combine microfluidics with optically decodable beads and show that phenotypic analysis of living cells can be linked to single-cell sequencing. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our tool called Single Cell Optical Phenotyping and Expression sequencing (SCOPE-Seq) to combine live cell imaging with single-cell RNA sequencing.",

        "Abstract": "The ability of extracellular vesicles (EVs) to regulate a broad range of cellular processes has recently been exploited for the treatment of diseases. For example, EVs secreted by stem cells injected into infarcted hearts can induce recovery through the delivery of stem-cell-specific miRNAs. However, the retention of the EVs and the therapeutic effects are short-lived. Here, we show that an engineered hydrogel patch capable of slowly releasing EVs secreted from cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells reduced arrhythmic burden, promoted ejection-fraction recovery, decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis 24 hours after infarction, and reduced infarct size and cell hypertrophy 4 weeks post-infarction when implanted onto infarcted rat hearts. We also show that the EVs are enriched with cardiac-specific miRNAs known to modulate cardiomyocyte-specific processes. The extended delivery of EVs secreted from iPS-cell-derived cardiomyocytes into the heart may help understand heart recovery and treat heart injury.",

        "Abstract": "Conventional differential expression analyses have been successfully employed to identify genes whose levels change across experimental conditions. One limitation of this approach is the inability to discover central regulators that control gene expression networks. In addition, while methods for identifying central nodes in a network are widely implemented, the bioinformatics validation process and the theoretical error estimates that reflect the uncertainty in each step of the analysis are rarely considered. Using the betweenness centrality measure, we identified Etv5 as a potential tissue-level regulator in murine neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) low-grade brain tumors (optic gliomas). As such, the expression of Etv5 and Etv5 target genes were increased in multiple independently-generated mouse optic glioma models relative to non-neoplastic (normal healthy) optic nerves, as well as in the cognate human tumors (pilocytic astrocytoma) relative to normal human brain. Importantly, differential Etv5 and Etv5 network expression was not directly the result of Nf1 gene dysfunction in specific cell types, but rather reflects a property of the tumor as an aggregate tissue. Moreover, this differential Etv5 expression was independently validated at the RNA and protein levels. Taken together, the combined use of network analysis, differential RNA expression findings, and experimental validation highlights the potential of the computational network approach to provide new insights into tumor biology.",

        "Abstract": "We and others have shown that transition and maintenance of biological states is controlled by master regulator proteins, which can be inferred by interrogating tissue-specific regulatory models (interactomes) with transcriptional signatures, using the VIPER algorithm. Yet, some tissues may lack molecular profiles necessary for interactome inference (orphan tissues), or, as for single cells isolated from heterogeneous samples, their tissue context may be undetermined. To address this problem, we introduce metaVIPER, an algorithm designed to assess protein activity in tissue-independent\u00a0fashion by integrative analysis of multiple, non-tissue-matched interactomes. This assumes that transcriptional targets of each protein will be recapitulated by one or more available interactomes. We confirm the algorithm's value in assessing protein dysregulation induced by somatic mutations, as well as in assessing protein activity in orphan tissues and, most critically, in single cells, thus allowing transformation of noisy and potentially biased RNA-Seq signatures into reproducible protein-activity signatures.",

        "Abstract": "Microglia are a major cellular component of gliomas, and abundant in the centre of the tumour and at the infiltrative margins. While glioma is a notoriously infiltrative disease, the dynamics of microglia and glioma migratory patterns have not been well characterized. To investigate the migratory behaviour of microglia and glioma cells at the infiltrative edge, we performed two-colour time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of brain slices generated from a platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB)-driven rat model of glioma, in which glioma cells and microglia were each labelled with one of two different fluorescent markers. We used mathematical techniques to analyse glioma cells and microglia motility with both single cell tracking and particle image velocimetry (PIV). Our results show microglia motility is strongly correlated with the presence of glioma, while the correlation of the speeds of glioma cells and microglia was variable and weak. Additionally, we showed that microglia and glioma cells exhibit different types of diffusive migratory behaviour. Microglia movement fit a simple random walk, while glioma cell movement fits a super diffusion pattern. These results show that glioma cells stimulate microglia motility at the infiltrative margins, creating a correlation between the spatial distribution of glioma cells and the pattern of microglia motility.",

        "Abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) currently is diagnosed by a temporal trend of a single blood analyte: serum creatinine. This measurement is neither sensitive nor specific to kidney injury or its protean forms. Newer biomarkers, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL, Lipocalin 2, Siderocalin), or kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1, Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 1), accelerate the diagnosis of AKI as well as prospectively distinguish rapidly reversible from prolonged causes of serum creatinine increase. Nonetheless, these biomarkers lack the capacity to subfractionate AKI further (eg, sepsis versus ischemia versus nephrotoxicity from medications, enzymes, or metals) or inform us about the primary and secondary sites of injury. It also is unknown whether all nephrons are injured in AKI, whether all cells in a nephron are affected, and whether injury responses can be stimulus-specific or cell type-specific or both. In this review, we summarize fully agnostic tissue interrogation approaches that may help to redefine AKI in cellular and molecular terms, including single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing technology. These approaches will empower a shift in the current paradigm of AKI diagnosis, classification, and staging, and provide the renal community with a significant advance toward precision medicine in the analysis AKI.",

While less studied, brain tumor (glioma) biology is likewise influenced by non-neoplastic immune system cells (macrophages and microglia) which interact with neoplastic glioma cells to create a unique physiological state (glioma ecosystem) distinct from that found in the normal tissue. To explore this neoplastic ground state, we leveraged several preclinical mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) optic glioma, a low-grade astrocytoma whose formation and maintenance requires productive interactions between non-neoplastic and neoplastic cells, and employed whole tumor RNA-sequencing and mathematical deconvolution strategies to characterize this low-grade glioma ecosystem as an aggregate of cellular and acellular elements. Using this approach, we demonstrate that optic gliomas generated by altering the germline ",

Although these screens affect thousands of gene products, the typical readout is based on low complexity rather than genome-wide assays. To address this limitation, we introduce pooled library amplification for transcriptome expression (PLATE-Seq), a low-cost, genome-wide mRNA profiling methodology specifically designed to complement high-throughput screening assays. Introduction of sample-specific barcodes during reverse transcription supports pooled library construction and low-depth sequencing that is 10- to 20-fold less expensive than conventional RNA-Seq. The use of network-based algorithms to infer protein activity from PLATE-Seq data results in comparable reproducibility to 30\u2009M read sequencing. Indeed, PLATE-Seq reproducibility compares favorably to other large-scale perturbational profiling studies such as the connectivity map and library of integrated network-based cellular signatures.Despite the importance of pharmacological and functional genomic screens the readouts are of low complexity. Here the authors introduce PLATE-Seq, a low-cost genome-wide mRNA profiling method to complement high-throughput screening.",

        "Title": "Climbing fiber-Purkinje cell synaptic pathology in tremor and cerebellar degenerative diseases.",
        "Abstract": "Changes in climbing fiber-Purkinje cell (CF-PC) synaptic connections have been found in the essential tremor (ET) cerebellum, and these changes are correlated with tremor severity. Whether these postmortem changes are specific to ET remains to be investigated. We assessed CF-PC synaptic pathology in the postmortem cerebellum across a range of degenerative movement disorders [10 Parkinson's disease (PD) cases, 10 multiple system atrophy (MSA) cases, 10 spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) cases, and 20 ET cases] and 25 controls. We observed differences in terms of CF pathological features across these disorders. Specifically, PD cases and ET cases both had more CFs extending into the parallel fiber (PF) territory, but ET cases had more complex branching and increased length of CFs in the PF territory along with decreased CF synaptic density compared to PD cases. MSA cases and SCA1 cases had the most severely reduced CF synaptic density and a marked paucity of CFs extending into the PF territory. Furthermore, CFs in a subset of MSA cases formed collateral branches parallel to the PC layer, a feature not seen in other diagnostic groups. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, the cases and controls could all be categorized into four clusters based on the CF pathology and features of PC pathology, including counts of PCs and their axonal torpedoes. ET cases and PD cases co-segregated into two clusters, whereas SCA1 cases and MSA cases formed another cluster, separate from the control cluster. Interestingly, the presence of resting tremor seemed to be the clinical feature that separated the cases into the two ET-PD clusters. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that these degenerative movement disorders seem to differ with respect to the pattern of CF synaptic pathology they exhibit. It remains to be determined how these differences contribute to the clinical presentations of these diseases.",

Microwell arrays are a particularly attractive microfluidic platform for single cell analysis due to their scalability, cell capture efficiency, and compatibility with imaging. We report an automated microwell array platform for single cell RNA-Seq with significantly improved performance over previous implementations. We demonstrate cell capture efficiencies of >50%, compatibility with commercially available barcoded mRNA capture beads, and parallel expression profiling from thousands of individual cells. We evaluate the level of cross-contamination in our platform by both tracking fluorescent cell lysate in sealed microwells and with a human-mouse mixed species RNA-Seq experiment. Finally, we apply our system to comprehensively assess heterogeneity in gene expression of patient-derived glioma neurospheres and uncover subpopulations similar to those observed in human glioma tissue.",

We report a new, ligation-free approach to ribosome profiling that does not require ligation. Library construction for ligation-free ribosome profiling can be completed in one day with as little as 1\u00a0ng of purified RNA footprints. We apply ligation-free ribosome profiling to mouse brain tissue to identify new patterns of cell type-specific translation and test its ability to identify translational targets of mTOR signaling in the brain.",

Here we describe a previously unknown subset of phenotypically naive human CD8(+) T cells that rapidly secreted multiple cytokines in response to persistent viral antigens but differed transcriptionally from memory and effector T cells. The frequency of these CD8(+) T cells, called 'memory T cells with a naive phenotype' (TMNP cells), increased with age and after severe acute infection and inversely correlated with the residual capacity of the immune system to respond to new infections with age. CD8(+) TMNP cells represent a potential new target for the immunotherapy of persistent infections and should be accounted for and subtracted from the naive pool if truly naive T cells are needed to respond to antigens.",

        "Abstract": "Although immune signaling has emerged as a defining feature of the glioma microenvironment, how the underlying structure of the glioma-infiltrating T-cell population differs from that of the blood from which it originates has been difficult to measure directly in patients. High-throughput sequencing of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires (TCRseq) provides a population-wide statistical description of how T cells respond to disease. We have defined immunophenotypes of whole repertoires based on TCRseq of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains from glioma tissue, nonneoplastic brain tissue, and peripheral blood from patients. Using information theory, we partitioned the diversity of these TCR repertoires into that from the distribution of VJ cassette combinations and diversity due to VJ-independent factors, such as selection due to antigen binding. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) possessed higher VJ-independent diversity than nonneoplastic tissue, stratifying patients according to tumor grade. We found that the VJ-independent components of tumor-associated repertoires diverge more from their corresponding peripheral repertoires than T-cell populations in nonneoplastic brain tissue, particularly for low-grade gliomas. Finally, we identified a \"signature\" set of TCRs whose use in peripheral blood is associated with patients exhibiting low TIL divergence and is depleted in patients with highly divergent TIL repertoires. This signature is detectable in peripheral blood, and therefore accessible noninvasively. We anticipate that these immunophenotypes will be foundational to monitoring and predicting response to antiglioma vaccines and immunotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain cancer. With a median survival of about a year, new approaches to treating this disease are necessary. To identify signaling molecules regulating GBM progression in a genetically engineered murine model of proneural GBM, we quantified phosphotyrosine-mediated signaling using mass spectrometry. Oncogenic signals, including phosphorylated ERK MAPK, PI3K, and PDGFR, were found to be increased in the murine tumors relative to brain. Phosphorylation of CDK1 pY15, associated with the G2 arrest checkpoint, was identified as the most differentially phosphorylated site, with a 14-fold increase in phosphorylation in the tumors. To assess the role of this checkpoint as a potential therapeutic target, syngeneic primary cell lines derived from these tumors were treated with MK-1775, an inhibitor of Wee1, the kinase responsible for CDK1 Y15 phosphorylation. MK-1775 treatment led to mitotic catastrophe, as defined by increased DNA damage and cell death by apoptosis. To assess the extensibility of targeting Wee1/CDK1 in GBM, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell lines were also treated with MK-1775. Although the response was more heterogeneous, on-target Wee1 inhibition led to decreased CDK1 Y15 phosphorylation and increased DNA damage and apoptosis in each line. These results were also validated in vivo, where single-agent MK-1775 demonstrated an antitumor effect on a flank PDX tumor model, increasing mouse survival by 1.74-fold. This study highlights the ability of unbiased quantitative phosphoproteomics to reveal therapeutic targets in tumor models, and the potential for Wee1 inhibition as a treatment approach in preclinical models of GBM.

In glioblastoma, these two processes are presumed mutually exclusive and hence termed \"go or grow.\" We identified a molecular target that shuttles between these disparate cellular processes-the molecular motor KIF11. Inhibition of KIF11 with a highly specific small-molecule inhibitor stopped the growth of the more treatment-resistant glioblastoma tumor-initiating cells (TICs, or cancer stem cells) as well as non-TICs and impeded tumor initiation and self-renewal of the TIC population. Targeting KIF11 also hit the other arm of the \"go or grow\" cell fate decision by reducing glioma cell invasion. Administration of a KIF11 inhibitor to mice bearing orthotopic glioblastoma prolonged their survival. In its role as a shared molecular regulator of cell growth and motility across intratumoral heterogeneity, KIF11 is a compelling therapeutic target for glioblastoma.",

        "Abstract": "Many important biological questions demand single-cell transcriptomics on a large scale. Hence, new tools are urgently needed for efficient, inexpensive manipulation of RNA from individual cells. We report a simple platform for trapping single-cell lysates in sealed, picoliter microwells capable of printing RNA on glass or capturing RNA on beads. We then develop a scalable technology for genome-wide, single-cell RNA-Seq. Our device generates pooled libraries from hundreds of individual cells with consumable costs of $0.10-$0.20 per cell and includes five lanes for simultaneous experiments. We anticipate that this system will serve as a general platform for single-cell imaging and sequencing.",

        "Abstract": "The stem cells that maintain and repair the postnatal skeleton remain undefined. One model suggests that perisinusoidal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) give rise to osteoblasts, chondrocytes, marrow stromal cells, and adipocytes, although the existence of these cells has not been proven through fate-mapping experiments. We demonstrate here that expression of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist gremlin 1 defines a population of osteochondroreticular (OCR) stem cells in the bone marrow. OCR stem cells self-renew and generate osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and reticular marrow stromal cells, but not adipocytes. OCR stem cells are concentrated within the metaphysis of long bones not in the perisinusoidal space and are needed for bone development, bone remodeling, and fracture repair. Grem1 expression also identifies intestinal reticular stem cells (iRSCs) that are cells of origin for the periepithelial intestinal mesenchymal sheath. Grem1 expression identifies distinct connective tissue stem cells in both the bone (OCR stem cells) and the intestine (iRSCs).",

        "Abstract": "Estrogen deprivation using aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is currently the standard of care for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Unfortunately, the majority of patients treated with AIs eventually develop resistance, inevitably resulting in patient relapse and, ultimately, death. The mechanism by which resistance occurs is still not completely known, however, recent studies suggest that impaired/defective interferon signaling might play a role. In the present study, we assessed the functional role of IFITM1 and PLSCR1; two well-known interferon response genes in AI resistance.",

        "Title": "Regulation of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Phospholipid Scramblase 1 in mast cells that are stimulated through the high-affinity IgE receptor.",
        "Abstract": "Engagement of high-affinity immunoglobulin E receptors (Fc\u03b5RI) activates two signaling pathways in mast cells. The Lyn pathway leads to recruitment of Syk and to calcium mobilization whereas the Fyn pathway leads to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase recruitment. Mapping the connections between both pathways remains an important task to be completed. We previously reported that Phospholipid Scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is phosphorylated on tyrosine after cross-linking Fc\u03b5RI on RBL-2H3 rat mast cells, amplifies mast cell degranulation, and is associated with both Lyn and Syk tyrosine kinases. Here, analysis of the pathway leading to PLSCR1 tyrosine phosphorylation reveals that it depends on the FcR\u03b3 chain. Fc\u03b5RI aggregation in Fyn-deficient mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) induced a more robust increase in Fc\u03b5RI-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PLSCR1 compared to wild-type cells, whereas PLSCR1 phosphorylation was abolished in Lyn-deficient BMMC. Lyn association with PLSCR1 was not altered in Fyn-deficient BMMC. PLSCR1 phosphorylation was also dependent on the kinase Syk and significantly, but partially, dependent on detectable calcium mobilization. Thus, the Lyn/Syk/calcium axis promotes PLSCR1 phosphorylation in multiple ways. Conversely, the Fyn-dependent pathway negatively regulates it. This study reveals a complex regulation for PLSCR1 tyrosine phosphorylation in Fc\u03b5RI-activated mast cells and that PLSCR1 sits at a crossroads between Lyn and Fyn pathways.",

        "Abstract": "Glioma growth is driven by signaling that ultimately regulates protein synthesis. Gliomas are also complex at the cellular level and involve multiple cell types, including transformed and reactive cells in the brain tumor microenvironment. The distinct functions of the various cell types likely lead to different requirements and regulatory paradigms for protein synthesis. Proneural gliomas can arise from transformation of glial progenitors that are driven to proliferate via mitogenic signaling that affects translation. To investigate translational regulation in this system, we developed a RiboTag glioma mouse model that enables cell-type-specific, genome-wide ribosome profiling of tumor tissue. Infecting glial progenitors with Cre-recombinant retrovirus simultaneously activates expression of tagged ribosomes and delivers a tumor-initiating mutation. Remarkably, we find that although genes specific to transformed cells are highly translated, their translation efficiencies are low compared with normal brain. Ribosome positioning reveals sequence-dependent regulation of ribosomal activity in 5'-leaders upstream of annotated start codons, leading to differential translation in glioma compared with normal brain. Additionally, although transformed cells express a proneural signature, untransformed tumor-associated cells, including reactive astrocytes and microglia, express a mesenchymal signature. Finally, we observe the same phenomena in human disease by combining ribosome profiling of human proneural tumor and non-neoplastic brain tissue with computational deconvolution to assess cell-type-specific translational regulation.",

        "Abstract": "Glioblastomas (GBMs) diffusely infiltrate the brain, making complete removal by surgical resection impossible. The mixture of neoplastic and nonneoplastic cells that remain after surgery form the biological context for adjuvant therapeutic intervention and recurrence. We performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and histological analysis on radiographically guided biopsies taken from different regions of GBM and showed that the tissue contained within the contrast-enhancing (CE) core of tumors have different cellular and molecular compositions compared with tissue from the nonenhancing (NE) margins of tumors. Comparisons with the The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset showed that the samples from CE regions resembled the proneural, classical, or mesenchymal subtypes of GBM, whereas the samples from the NE regions predominantly resembled the neural subtype. Computational deconvolution of the RNA-seq data revealed that contributions from nonneoplastic brain cells significantly influence the expression pattern in the NE samples. Gene ontology analysis showed that the cell type-specific expression patterns were functionally distinct and highly enriched in genes associated with the corresponding cell phenotypes. Comparing the RNA-seq data from the GBM samples to that of nonneoplastic brain revealed that the differentially expressed genes are distributed across multiple cell types. Notably, the patterns of cell type-specific alterations varied between the different GBM subtypes: the NE regions of proneural tumors were enriched in oligodendrocyte progenitor genes, whereas the NE regions of mesenchymal GBM were enriched in astrocytic and microglial genes. These subtype-specific patterns provide new insights into molecular and cellular composition of the infiltrative margins of GBM.",

        "Abstract": "Proneural glioblastoma is defined by an expression pattern resembling that of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and carries a distinctive set of genetic alterations. Whether there is a functional relationship between the proneural phenotype and the associated genetic alterations is unknown. To evaluate this possible relationship, we performed a longitudinal molecular characterization of tumor progression in a mouse model of proneural glioma. In this setting, the tumors acquired remarkably consistent genetic deletions at late stages of progression, similar to those deleted in human proneural glioblastoma. Further investigations revealed that p53 is a master regulator of the transcriptional network underlying the proneural phenotype. This p53-centric transcriptional network and its associated phenotype were observed at both the early and late stages of progression, and preceded the proneural-specific deletions. Remarkably, deletion of p53 at the time of tumor initiation obviated the acquisition of later deletions, establishing a link between the proneural transcriptional network and the subtype-specific deletions selected during glioma progression.",

        "Abstract": "Molecular subtypes of glioblastoma (GBM) with distinct alterations have been identified. There is need for reproducible, versatile preclinical models that resemble specific GBM phenotypes to facilitate preclinical testing of novel therapies. We present a cell line-based murine proneural GBM model and characterize its response to radiation therapy. Proneural gliomas were generated by injecting PDGF-IRES-Cre retrovirus into the subcortical white matter of adult mice that harbor floxed tumor suppressors (Pten and p53) and stop-floxed reporters. Primary cell cultures were generated from the retrovirus induced tumors and maintained in vitro for multiple passages. RNA sequencing-based expression profiling of the resulting cell lines was performed. The tumorigenic potential of the cells was assessed by intracranial injection into adult na\u00efve mice from different strains. Tumor growth was assessed by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). BLI for tumor cells and brain slices were obtained and compared to in vivo BLI. Response to whole-brain radiation was assessed in glioma-bearing animals. Intracranial injection of Pdgf(+)Pten(-/-)p53(-/-)luciferase(+) glioma cells led to formation of GBM-like tumors with 100 % efficiency (n = 48) and tumorigenesis was retained for more than 3 generations. The cell lines specifically resembled proneural GBM based on expression profiling by RNA-Seq. Pdgf(+)Pten(-/-)p53(-/-)luciferase(+) cell number correlated with BLI signal. Serial BLI measured tumor growth and correlated with size and location by ex vivo imaging. Moreover, BLI predicted tumor-related mortality with a 93 % risk of death within 5 days following a BLI signal between 1 \u00d7 10(8) and 5 \u00d7 10(8) photons/s cm(2). BLI signal had transient but significant response following radiotherapy, which corresponded to a modest survival benefit for radiated mice (p < 0.05). Intracranial injection of Pdgf(+)Pten(-/-)p53(-/-)luciferase(+) cells constitutes a novel and highly reproducible model, recapitulating key features of human proneural GBM, and can be used to evaluate tumor-growth and response to therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Calcium-regulated exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells and neurons is accompanied by the redistribution of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the extracellular space, leading to a disruption of plasma membrane asymmetry. How and why outward translocation of PS occurs during secretion are currently unknown. Immunogold labeling on plasma membrane sheets coupled with hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrate that PS translocation occurs at the vicinity of the secretory granule fusion sites. We found that altering the function of the phospholipid scramblase-1 (PLSCR-1) by expressing a PLSCR-1 calcium-insensitive mutant or by using chromaffin cells from PLSCR-1\u207b/\u207b mice prevents outward translocation of PS in cells stimulated for exocytosis. Remarkably, whereas transmitter release was not affected, secretory granule membrane recapture after exocytosis was impaired, indicating that PLSCR-1 is required for compensatory endocytosis but not for exocytosis. Our results provide the first evidence for a role of specific lipid reorganization and calcium-dependent PLSCR-1 activity in neuroendocrine compensatory endocytosis.",

Here we show that myeloid progenitors can be derived from embryonic stem cells, immortalized, and applied to the study of the mechanisms underlying myeloid differentiation. The embryonic stem cell-derived myeloid progenitors, when immortalized with estrogen-regulated Hoxb8 protein, demonstrate normal karyotyping, are genetically tractable, and can be differentiated into functional neutrophils. Using this model, we identified mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 as a critical regulator of myeloid differentiation. Together, our studies led to a convenient, karyotypically normal, and genetically manipulatable cellular system, which can be used to shed new light on the mechanisms for myeloid differentiation.",

Here we introduce chemical methods for the rapid quantification of a wide range of chemical and microbial contaminations using a simple instrument. Within the testing procedure, we used a multichannel, multisample, UV-vis spectrophotometer/fluorometer that employs two frequencies of light simultaneously to interrogate the sample. We present new enzyme- and dye-based methods to detect (di)ethylene glycol in consumables above 0.1 wt % without interference and alcohols above 1 ppb. Using DNA intercalating dyes, we can detect a range of pathogens ( E. coli , Salmonella , V. Cholera, and a model for Malaria) in water, foods, and blood without background signal. We achieved universal scaling independent of pathogen size above 10(4) CFU/mL by taking advantage of the simultaneous measurement at multiple wavelengths. We can detect contaminants directly, without separation, purification, concentration, or incubation. Our chemistry is stable to \u00b1 1% for >3 weeks without refrigeration, and measurements require <5 min.",

        "Abstract": "RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful tool for transcriptome profiling, but is hampered by sequence-dependent bias and inaccuracy at low copy numbers intrinsic to exponential PCR amplification. We developed a simple strategy for mitigating these complications, allowing truly digital RNA-Seq. Following reverse transcription, a large set of barcode sequences is added in excess, and nearly every cDNA molecule is uniquely labeled by random attachment of barcode sequences to both ends. After PCR, we applied paired-end deep sequencing to read the two barcodes and cDNA sequences. Rather than counting the number of reads, RNA abundance is measured based on the number of unique barcode sequences observed for a given cDNA sequence. We optimized the barcodes to be unambiguously identifiable, even in the presence of multiple sequencing errors. This method allows counting with single-copy resolution despite sequence-dependent bias and PCR-amplification noise, and is analogous to digital PCR but amendable to quantifying a whole transcriptome. We demonstrated transcriptome profiling of Escherichia coli with more accurate and reproducible quantification than conventional RNA-Seq.",

Here, we demonstrate that stress-induced unconventional export of FGF1, a potent and ubiquitously expressed mitogenic and proangiogenic protein, is associated with and dependent on the formation of membrane blebs and localized cell surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS). In addition, we found that the differentiation of promonocytic cells results in massive FGF1 release, which also correlates with membrane blebbing and exposure of PS. These findings indicate that the externalization of acidic phospholipids could be used as a pharmacological target to regulate the availability of FGF1 in the organism.",

        "Abstract": "Importin \u03b11 can bind classical nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in two NLS-binding sites, known as \"major\" and \"minor.\" The major site is located between ARM repeats 2-4, whereas the minor site spans ARM 7-8. In this study, we have characterized the cellular localization of human phospholipid scramblase 4 (hPLSCR4), a member of the phospholipid scramblase protein family. We identified a minimal NLS in hPLSCR4 ((273)GSIIRKWN(280)) that contains only two basic amino acids. This NLS is both necessary for nuclear localization of hPLSCR4 in transfected HeLa cells and sufficient for nuclear import of a non-diffusible cargo in permeabilized cells. Mutation of only one of the two basic residues, Arg(277), correlates with loss of nuclear localization, suggesting this amino acid plays a key role in nuclear transport. Crystallographic analysis of mammalian importin \u03b11 in complex with the hPLSCR4-NLS reveals this minimal NLS binds specifically and exclusively to the minor binding site of importin \u03b1. These data provide the first structural and functional evidence of a novel NLS-binding mode in importin \u03b11 that uses only the minor groove as the exclusive site for nuclear import of nonclassical cargos.",

        "Abstract": "We developed a multiplex sequencing-by-synthesis method combining terminal phosphate-labeled fluorogenic nucleotides (TPLFNs) and resealable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microreactors. In the presence of phosphatase, primer extension by DNA polymerase using nonfluorescent TPLFNs generates fluorophores, which are confined in the microreactors and detected. We immobilized primed DNA templates in the microreactors, then sequentially introduced one of the four identically labeled TPLFNs, sealed the microreactors and recorded a fluorescence image after template-directed primer extension. With cycle times of <10 min, we demonstrate 30 base reads with \u223c99% raw accuracy. Our 'fluorogenic pyrosequencing' offers benefits of pyrosequencing, such as rapid turnaround, one-color detection and generation of native DNA, along with high detection sensitivity and simplicity of parallelization because simultaneous real-time monitoring of all microreactors is not required.",

        "Abstract": "PLSCR1-/- mice exhibit normal, steady-state hematologic parameters but impaired emergency granulopoiesis upon in vivo administration of G-CSF. The mechanism by which PLSCR1 contributes to G-CSF-induced neutrophil production is largely unknown. We now report that the expansion of bone marrow myelocytes upon in vivo G-CSF treatment is reduced in PLSCR1-/- mice relative to WT. Using SCF-ER-Hoxb8-immortalized myeloid progenitors to examine the progression of G-CSF-driven granulocytic differentiation in vitro, we found that PLSCR1 prolongs the period of mitotic expansion of proliferative granulocyte precursors, thereby giving rise to increased neutrophil production from their progenitors. This effect of PLSCR1 is blocked by a \u0394NLS-PLSCR1, which prevents its nuclear import. By contrast, mutation that prevents the membrane association of PLSCR1 has minimal impact on the role of PLSCR1 in G-CSF-induced granulopoiesis. These data imply that the capacity of PLSCR1 to augment G-CSF-dependent production of mature neutrophils from myeloid progenitors is unrelated to its reported activities at the endofacial surface of the plasma membrane but does require entry of the protein into the nucleus, suggesting that this response is mediated through the observed effects of PLSCR1 on gene transcription.",

        "Title": "Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.",
        "Abstract": "In all animal cells, phospholipids are asymmetrically distributed between the outer and inner leaflets of the plasma membrane. This asymmetrical phospholipid distribution is disrupted in various biological systems. For example, when blood platelets are activated, they expose phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) to trigger the clotting system. The PtdSer exposure is believed to be mediated by Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid scramblases that transport phospholipids bidirectionally, but its molecular mechanism is still unknown. Here we show that TMEM16F (transmembrane protein 16F) is an essential component for the Ca(2+)-dependent exposure of PtdSer on the cell surface. When a mouse B-cell line, Ba/F3, was treated with a Ca(2+) ionophore under low-Ca(2+) conditions, it reversibly exposed PtdSer. Using this property, we established a Ba/F3 subline that strongly exposed PtdSer by repetitive fluorescence-activated cell sorting. A complementary DNA library was constructed from the subline, and a cDNA that caused Ba/F3 to expose PtdSer spontaneously was identified by expression cloning. The cDNA encoded a constitutively active mutant of TMEM16F, a protein with eight transmembrane segments. Wild-type TMEM16F was localized on the plasma membrane and conferred Ca(2+)-dependent scrambling of phospholipids. A patient with Scott syndrome, which results from a defect in phospholipid scrambling activity, was found to carry a mutation at a splice-acceptor site of the gene encoding TMEM16F, causing the premature termination of the protein.",

We can distinguish single and multiple motor-driven cargoes and show that the stall forces for inward and outward transported cargoes are similar.

        "Abstract": "The relationships among gene regulatory mechanisms in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum throughout its asexual intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) remain poorly understood. To investigate the level and nature of transcriptional activity and its role in controlling gene expression during the IDC, we performed nuclear run-on on whole-transcriptome samples from time points throughout the IDC and found a peak in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional activity related to both the number of nuclei per parasite and variable transcriptional activity per nucleus over time. These differential total transcriptional activity levels allowed the calculation of the absolute transcriptional activities of individual genes from gene-specific nuclear run-on hybridization data. For half of the genes analyzed, sense-strand transcriptional activity peaked at the same time point as total activity. The antisense strands of several genes were substantially transcribed. Comparison of the transcriptional activity of the sense strand of each gene to its steady-state RNA abundance across the time points assayed revealed both correlations and discrepancies, implying transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation, respectively. Our results demonstrate that such comparisons can effectively indicate gene regulatory mechanisms in P. falciparum and suggest that genes with diverse transcriptional activity levels and patterns combine to produce total transcriptional activity levels tied to parasite development during the IDC.",

        "Abstract": "The study of cellular processes such as organelle transport often demands particle tracking with microsecond time-resolution and nanometer spatial precision, posing significant challenges to existing tracking methods. Here, we have developed a novel strategy for two-dimensional tracking of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) with 25 mus time resolution and approximately 1.5 nm spatial precision, by using a quadrant photodiode to record the positions of GNPs in an objective-type dark-field microscope. In combination with a feedback loop, this technique records long, high time-resolution and spatial precision trajectories of endocytosed GNPs transported by the molecular motors kinesin and dynein in a living cell. In the full range of organelle velocities (0-8 microm s(-1)), we clearly resolve the individual 8 nm steps of cargoes carried by kinesin, and the 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 nm steps of those carried by dynein. These experiments yield new information about molecular motor stepping in living cells.",

This Target-locking Acquisition with Realtime Confocal (TARC) microscopy system integrates fast image processing and rapid image acquisition using a Nipkow spinning-disk confocal microscope. The system acquires a 3D stack of images, performs a full structural analysis to locate a feature of interest, moves the sample in response, and then collects the next 3D image stack. In this way, data collection is dynamically adjusted to keep a moving object centered in the field of view. We demonstrate the system's capabilities by target-locking freely-diffusing clusters of attractive colloidal particles, and activelytransported quantum dots (QDs) endocytosed into live cells free to move in three dimensions, for several hours. During this time, both the colloidal clusters and live cells move distances several times the length of the imaging volume.",

        "Title": "Expression of the phospholipid scramblase (PLSCR) gene family during the acute phase response.",
        "Abstract": "Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is a member of PLSCR gene family that has been implicated in multiple cellular processes including movement of phospholipids, gene regulation, immuno-activation, and cell proliferation/apoptosis. In the present study, we identified PLSCR1 as a positive intracellular acute phase protein that is upregulated by LPS in liver, heart, and adipose tissue, but not skeletal muscle. LPS administration resulted in a marked increase in PLSCR1 mRNA and protein levels in the liver. This stimulation occurred rapidly (within 2 h), and was very sensitive to LPS (half-maximal response at 0.1 microg/mouse). Moreover, two other APR-inducers, zymosan and turpentine, also produced significant increases in PLSCR1 mRNA and protein levels, indicating that PLSCR1 was stimulated in a number of models of the APR. To determine signaling pathways by which LPS stimulated PLSCR1, we examined the effect of proinflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo. TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 all stimulated PLSCR1 in cultured Hep B3 hepatocytes, whereas only TNFalpha stimulated PLSCR1 in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, suggesting cell type-specific effects of cytokines. Furthermore, the LPS-stimulated increase in liver PLSCR1 mRNA was greatly attenuated by 80% in TNFalpha and IL-1beta receptor null mice as compared to wild-type controls. In contrast, PLSCR1 levels in adipose tissue were induced to a similar extent in TNFalpha and IL-1beta receptor null mice and controls. These results indicate that maximal stimulation of PLSCR1 by LPS in liver required TNFalpha and/or IL-1beta, whereas the stimulation of PLSCR1 in adipose tissue is not dependent on TNFalpha and/or IL-1beta. These data provide evidence that PLSCR1 is a positive intracellular acute phase protein with a tissue-specific mechanism for up-regulation.",

One such candidate, that encoding phospholipid scramblase 3 (PLSCR3), was recently identified, as genetic deletion of it led to lipid accumulation in abdominal fat pads and changes characteristic of metabolic syndrome. Because adipose tissue is increasingly recognized as an endocrine organ, capable of releasing small molecules that modulate disparate physiological processes, we examined the plasma from wild-type, Plscr1-/-, Plscr3-/- and Plscr1&3-/- mice. Using an untargeted comprehensive metabolite profiling approach coupled with targeted gene expression analyses, the perturbed biochemistry and functional redundancy of PLSCR proteins was assessed.",

        "Abstract": "The ongoing problems in business leadership over the past five years have underscored the need for a new kind of leader in the twenty-first century: the authentic leader. Author Bill George, a Harvard Business School professor and the former chairman and CEO of Medtronic, and his colleagues, conducted the largest leadership development study ever undertaken. They interviewed 125 business leaders from different racial, religious, national, and socioeconomic backgrounds to understand how leaders become and remain authentic. Their interviews showed that you do not have to be born with any particular characteristics or traits to lead. You also do not have to be at the top of your organization. Anyone can learn to be an authentic leader. The journey begins with leaders understanding their life stories. Authentic leaders frame their stories in ways that allow them to see themselves not as passive observers but as individuals who learn from their experiences. These leaders make time to examine their experiences and to reflect on them, and in doing so they grow as individuals and as leaders. Authentic leaders also work hard at developing self-awareness through persistent and often courageous self-exploration. Denial can be the greatest hurdle that leaders face in becoming self-aware, but authentic leaders ask for, and listen to, honest feedback. They also use formal and informal support networks to help them stay grounded and lead integrated lives. The authors argue that achieving business results over a sustained period of time is the ultimate mark of authentic leadership. It may be possible to drive short-term outcomes without being authentic, but authentic leadership is the only way to create long-term results.",

        "Title": "The negative c-Myc target onzin affects proliferation and apoptosis via its obligate interaction with phospholipid scramblase 1.",
        "Abstract": "Onzin, the product of a negatively c-Myc-regulated target gene, is highly expressed in myeloid cells. As a result of its interaction with and activation of Akt1 and Mdm2, onzin down-regulates p53. The apoptotic sensitivity of several cell lines is thus directly related to onzin levels. We have conducted a search for additional onzin-interacting proteins and identified phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), an endofacial membrane protein, which is proposed to mediate the bidirectional movement of plasma membrane phospholipids during proliferation and apoptosis. PLSCR1 interacts with the same cysteine-rich domain of onzin as do Akt1 and Mdm2, whereas the onzin-interacting domain of PLSCR1 centers around, but does not require, a previously identified palmitoylation signal. Depletion of endogenous PLSCR1 in myeloid cells leads to a phenotype that mimics that of onzin overexpression, providing evidence that PLSCR1 is a physiologic regulator of onzin. In contrast, PLSCR1 overexpression in fibroblasts, which normally do not express onzin, affects neither growth nor apoptosis unless onzin is coexpressed, in which case PLSCR1 completely abrogates onzin's positive effects on proliferation and survival. These findings demonstrate a functional interdependence between onzin and PLSCR1. They further suggest a contiguous link between the earliest events mediated by c-Myc and the latest ones, which culminate at the cell surface and lead to phospholipid reshuffling and cell death.",

The brightness and photostability of quantum dots allow us to record motor displacement traces with 300 micros time resolution and 1.5 nm spatial precision. We observed individual 8 nm steps in active transport toward both the microtubule plus- and minus-ends, the directions of kinesin and dynein movements, respectively. In addition, we clearly resolved abrupt 16 nm steps in the plus-end direction and often consecutive 16 nm and occasional 24 nm steps in minus-end directed movements. This work demonstrates the ability of the QD assay to probe the operation of motor proteins at the molecular level in living cells under physiological conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), a calcium-binding protein that either inserts into the plasma membrane or binds to genomic DNA in the nucleus, has been shown to contribute to the cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis as well as antiviral activity of interferon (IFN). The expression of PLSCR1 protein is also known to be markedly increased in response to IFN and to some differentiation inducing agents such as all-trans retinoic acid, but the precise mechanisms of this response remain to be investigated. In this study, we show that the protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta)-specific inhibitor rottlerin and the dominant negative mutant of PKCdelta significantly antagonized IFN-induced PLSCR1 expression. The influence of PKCdelta on IFN-mediated induction of PLSCR1 was dependent upon the phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727. Furthermore, PKCdelta-mediated activation of STAT1 required the activation of JNK, as the inhibition of JNK activity by its specific inhibitor or transfection of its dominant negative mutant suppressed both serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and PLSCR1 expression but not the activation of PKCdelta. In conclusion, our results suggest that the induction of PLSCR1 transcription through STAT1 depends upon sequential activation of PKCdelta and JNK.",

        "Abstract": "Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is a multiply palmitoylated, endofacial membrane protein originally identified based on its capacity to promote accelerated transbilayer phospholipid movement in response to Ca(2+). Recent evidence suggests that this protein also participates in cell response to various growth factors and cytokines, influencing myeloid differentiation, tumor growth, and the antiviral activity of interferon. Whereas plasma membrane PLSCR1 was shown to be required for normal recruitment and activation of Src kinase by stimulated cell surface growth factor receptors, PLSCR1 was also found to traffic into the nucleus and to tightly bind to genomic DNA, suggesting a possible additional nuclear function. We now report evidence that PLSCR1 directly binds to the 5'-promoter region of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 1 gene (IP3R1) to enhance expression of the receptor. Probing a CpG island genomic library with PLSCR1 as bait identified four clones with avidity for PLSCR1, including a 191-bp fragment of the IP3R1 promoter. Using electrophoretic mobility shift and transcription reporter assays, the PLSCR1-binding site in IP3R1 was mapped to residues (-101)GTAACCATGTGGA(-89), and the segment spanning Met(86)-Glu(118) in PLSCR1 was identified to mediate its transcriptional activity. The significance of this interaction between PLSCR1 and IP3R1 in situ was confirmed by comparing levels of IP3R1 mRNA and protein in matched cells that either expressed or were deficient in PLSCR1. These data suggest that in addition to its role at the plasma membrane, effects of PLSCR1 on cell proliferative and maturational responses may also relate to alterations in expression of cellular IP3 receptors.",

        "Title": "Relative contributions of desolvation, inter- and intramolecular interactions to binding affinity in protein kinase systems.",
        "Abstract": "In several previous studies, we performed sensitivity analysis to gauge the relative importance of different atomic partial charges in determining protein-ligand binding. In this work, we gain further insights by decomposing these results into three contributions: desolvation, intramolecular interactions, and intermolecular interactions, again based on a Poisson continuum electrostatics model. Three protein kinase-inhibitor systems have been analyzed: CDK2-deschloroflavopiridol, PKA-PKI, and LCK-PP2. Although our results point out the importance of specific intermolecular interactions to the binding affinity, they also reveal the remarkable contributions from the solvent-mediated intramolecular interactions in some cases. Thus, it is necessary to look beyond analyzing protein-ligand interactions to understand protein-ligand recognition or to gain insights into designing ligands and proteins. In analyzing the contributions of the three components to the overall binding free energy, the PKA-PKI system with a much larger ligand was found to behave differently from the other two systems with smaller ligands. In the former case, the intermolecular interactions are very favorable, and together with the favorable solvent-mediated intramolecular interactions, they overcome the large desolvation penalties to give a favorable electrostatics contribution to the overall binding affinity. On the other hand, the other two systems with smaller ligands only present modest intermolecular interactions and they are not or are only barely sufficient to overcome the desolvation penalty even with the aid of the favorable intramolecular contributions. As a result, the binding affinity of these two systems do not or only barely benefit from electrostatics contributions.",

        "Abstract": "Nuclear import of proteins containing a classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) is an energy-dependent process that requires the heterodimer importin alpha/beta. Three to six basic contiguous arginine/lysine residues characterize a classical NLS and are thought to form a basic patch on the surface of the import cargo. In this study, we have characterized the NLS of phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), a lipid-binding protein that enters the nucleus via the nonclassical NLS (257)GKISKHWTGI(266). This import sequence lacks a contiguous stretch of positively charged residues, and it is enriched in hydrophobic residues. We have determined the 2.2 A crystal structure of a complex between the PLSCR1 NLS and the armadillo repeat core of vertebrate importin alpha. Our crystallographic analysis reveals that PLSCR1 NLS binds to armadillo repeats 1-4 of importin alpha, but its interaction partially overlaps the classical NLS binding site. Two PLSCR1 lysines occupy the canonical positions indicated as P2 and P5. Moreover, we present in vivo evidence that the critical lysine at position P2, which is essential in other known NLS sequences, is dispensable in PLSCR1 NLS. Taken together, these data provide insight into a novel nuclear localization signal that presents a distinct motif for binding to importin alpha.",

This study attempts to determine the mean daily per capita consumption of salt, the iodine content of salt in the households and retail shops and the urinary iodine concentration in children (6-12 years) in Hella Region, Southern Highland Province (SHP), PNG. The mean daily consumption of salt was 2.62 +/- 1.29 g. The iodine content of salt was >30 p.p.m. in 95 per cent of households and 100 per cent of retail shops. The median urinary iodine concentration of 48.0 mg/l for all the children indicates moderate iodine deficiency. The median urinary iodine concentrations for the male (67.0 mg/l) and female (44.0 mg/l) children indicate mild and moderate iodine deficiency, respectively. 68.42 per cent of the male and 81.82 per cent of the female children have urinary iodine concentration <100 mg/l, indicating that iodine deficiency is a potential public health problem in the Hella region. These results indicate a need for further assessment of the implementation of the universal salt iodization strategy for the elimination of iodine deficiency in the SHP, PNG.",

        "Abstract": "Cholesterol is believed to serve as the common receptor for the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs). One member of this toxin family, Streptococcus intermedius intermedilysin (ILY), exhibits a narrow spectrum of cellular specificity that is seemingly inconsistent with this premise. We show here that ILY, via its domain 4 structure, binds to the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein human CD59 (huCD59). CD59 is an inhibitor of the membrane attack complex of human complement. ILY specifically binds to huCD59 via residues that are the binding site for the C8alpha and C9 complement proteins. These studies provide a new model for the mechanism of cellular recognition by a CDC.",

        "Title": "Adiposity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance in mice with targeted deletion of phospholipid scramblase 3 (PLSCR3).",
        "Abstract": "The phospholipid scramblases (PLSCR1 to PLSCR4) are a structurally and functionally unique class of proteins, which are products of a tetrad of genes conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. The best characterized member of this family, PLSCR1, is implicated in the remodeling of the transbilayer distribution of plasma membrane phospholipids but is also required for normal signaling through select growth factor receptors. Mice with targeted deletion of PLSCR1 display perinatal granulocytopenia due to defective response of hematopoietic precursors to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and stem cell factor. To gain insight into the biologic function of another member of the PLSCR family, we investigated mice with targeted deletion of PLSCR3, a protein that like PLSCR1 is expressed in many blood cells but which, by contrast to PLSCR1, is also highly expressed in fat and muscle. PLSCR3(-/-) mice at 2 months of age displayed aberrant accumulation of abdominal fat when maintained on standard rodent chow, which was accompanied by insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia. Primary adipocytes and cultured bone-marrow-derived macrophages from PLSCR3(-/-) mice were engorged with neutral lipid, and adipocytes displayed defective responses to exogenous insulin. Plasma of PLSCR3(-/-) mice was elevated in non-high-density lipoproteins, cholesterol, triglycerides, nonesterified fatty acids, and leptin, whereas adiponectin was low. These data suggest that the expression of PLSCR3 may be required for normal adipocyte and/or macrophage maturation or function and raise the possibility that deletions or mutations affecting the PLSCR3(-/-) gene locus may contribute to the risk for lipid-related disorders in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is an interferon (IFN)- and growth factor-inducible, calcium-binding protein that either inserts into the plasma membrane or binds DNA in the nucleus depending on its state of palmyitoylation. In certain hematopoietic cells, PLSCR1 is required for normal maturation and terminal differentiation from progenitor cells as regulated by select growth factors, where it promotes recruitment and activation of Src kinases. PLSCR1 is a substrate of Src (and Abl) kinases, and transcription of the PLSCR1 gene is regulated by the same growth factor receptor pathways in which PLSCR1 potentiates afferent signaling. The marked transcriptional upregulation of PLSCR1 by IFNs led us to explore whether PLSCR1 plays an analogous role in cellular responses to IFN, with specific focus on antiviral activities. Accordingly, human cells in which PLSCR1 expression was decreased with short interfering RNA were rendered relatively insensitive to the antiviral activity of IFNs, resulting in higher titers of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and encephalomyocarditis virus. Similarly, VSV replicated to higher titers in mouse PLSCR1(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts than in identical cells transduced to express PLSCR1. PLSCR1 inhibited accumulation of primary VSV transcripts, similar to the effects of IFN against VSV. The antiviral effect of PLSCR1 correlated with increased expression of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including ISG15, ISG54, p56, and guanylate binding proteins. Our results suggest that PLSCR1, which is itself an ISG-encoded protein, provides a mechanism for amplifying and enhancing the IFN response through increased expression of a select subset of potent antiviral genes.",

        "Title": "Protein kinase Cdelta mediates retinoic acid and phorbol myristate acetate-induced phospholipid scramblase 1 gene expression: its role in leukemic cell differentiation.",
        "Abstract": "Although phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) was originally identified based on its capacity to promote transbilayer movement of membrane phospholipids, subsequent studies also provided evidence for its role in cell proliferation, maturation, and apoptosis. In this report, we investigate the potential role of PLSCR1 in leukemic cell differentiation. We show that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an effective differentiation-inducing agent of acute promyelocytic leukemic (APL) cells, can elevate PLSCR1 expression in ATRA-sensitive APL cells NB4 and HL60, but not in maturation-resistant NB4-LR1 cells. ATRA- and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced monocytic differentiation is accompanied by increased PLSCR1 expression, whereas only a slight or no elevation of PLSCR1 expression is observed in U937 cells differentiated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), sodium butyrate, or vitamin D3. Cell differentiation with ATRA and PMA, but not with vitamin D3 or DMSO, results in phosphorylation of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta), and the PKCdelta-specific inhibitor rottlerin nearly eliminates the ATRA- and PMA-induced expression of PLSCR1, while ectopic expression of a constitutively active form of PKCdelta directly increases PLSCR1 expression. Finally, decreasing PLSCR1 expression with small interfering RNA inhibits ATRA/PMA-induced differentiation. Taken together, these results suggest that as a protein induced upon PKCdelta activation, PLSCR1 is required for ATRA- and PMA-triggered leukemic cell differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "Examining the potential for electrostatic complementarity between a ligand and a receptor is a useful technique for rational drug design, and can demonstrate how a system prioritizes interactions when allowed to optimize its charge distribution. In this computational study, we implemented the previously developed, continuum solvent-based charge optimization theory with a simple, quadratic programming algorithm and the UHBD Poisson-Boltzmann solver. This method allows one to compute the best set of point charges for a ligand or ligand region based on the ligand and receptor shape, and the receptor partial charges, by optimizing the binding free energy obtained from a continuum-solvent model. We applied charge optimization to a fragment of the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) of protein kinase A (PKA), to three flavopiridol inhibitors of CDK2, and to cyclin A which interacts with CDK2 to regulate the cell cycle. We found that a combination of global (involving every charge) and local (involving only charges in a local region) optimization can give useful hints for designing better inhibitors. Although some parts of an inhibitor may already contribute significantly to binding, we found that they could still be the most important targets for modifications to obtain stronger binders. In studying the binding of flavopiridol inhibitors to CDK2, comparable binding affinity could be obtained regardless of whether the net charges of the inhibitors were constrained to -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2 during the optimization. This provides flexibility in inhibitor design when a certain net charge of the inhibitor is desired in addition to strong binding affinity. For the study of the PKA-PKI and CDK2-cyclin A interfaces, we identified residues whose charge distributions are already close to optimal and those whose charge distributions could be refined to further improve binding.",

        "Title": "Phospholipid scramblase 1 is imported into the nucleus by a receptor-mediated pathway and interacts with DNA.",
        "Abstract": "Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is a multiply palmitoylated, Ca(2+)-binding, endofacial plasma membrane protein originally identified by its capacity to accelerate transbilayer movement of membrane phospholipids. We recently reported that when palmitoylation of PLSCR1 does not occur, it is localized to the nucleus rather than the plasma membrane. Nuclear localization of PLSCR1 was also observed upon induction of its de novo synthesis by cytokines such as interferon alpha that activate the PLSCR1 gene. Despite its capacity to enter the nucleus, its sequence does not predict a nuclear localization signal. To gain insight into the mechanism and potential significance of nuclear PLSCR1, we investigated the conditions required for its import and retention in the nucleus. We show that nuclear localization of PLSCR1 is dependent on cytosolic factors and energy. Furthermore, we show that PLSCR1 is specifically transported into the nucleus by the importin alpha/beta import pathway, and binds directly and with high affinity to importin alpha. Analysis of deletion mutants suggested that the NLS of PLSCR1 is between residues 242 and 290 and, furthermore, that a peptide within this region encompassing residues (257)GKISKHWTGI(266) is sufficient for nuclear import when conjugated to BSA. In addition, in intact cells, mutation of positively charged amino acids within this putative NLS in the full-length protein completely blocked its entry into the nucleus, consistent with its role in targeting PLSCR1 to the nucleus. Release of PLSCR1 from the nucleus was only observed after treatment of cells with both detergent and an elevated NaCl concentration, or following DNase treatment of the nucleus, suggesting ionic interactions of PLSCR1 with a nuclear component bound to genomic DNA or directly with genomic DNA. Purified PLSCR1 was also found to bind directly to a genomic DNA-cellulose conjugate, and its elution from DNA also required an elevated NaCl concentration. These data support a mechanism of receptor-mediated nuclear import of PLSCR1 and suggest a potential nuclear function for this plasma membrane protein.",

        "Abstract": "Phospholipid scramblase (PLSCR1) is a multiply palmitoylated, calcium-binding endofacial membrane protein proposed to mediate transbilayer movement of plasma membrane phospholipids. PLSCR1 is a component of membrane lipid rafts and has been shown to both physically and functionally interact with activated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors and other raft-associated cell surface receptors. Cell stimulation by EGF results in Tyr phosphorylation of PLSCR1, its association with both Shc and EGF receptors, and rapid cycling of PLSCR1 between plasma membrane and endosomal compartments. We now report evidence that upon EGF stimulation, PLSCR1 is phosphorylated by c-Src, within the tandem repeat sequence 68VYNQPVYNQP77. The in vivo interaction between PLSCR1 and Shc requires the Src-mediated phosphorylation on tyrosines 69 and 74. In in vitro pull down studies, phosphorylated PLSCR1 was found to bind directly to Shc through the phosphotyrosine binding domain. Consistent with the potential role of PLSCR1 in growth factor signaling pathways, granulocyte precursors derived from mice deficient in PLSCR1 show impaired proliferation and maturation under cytokine stimulation. Using PLSCR1-/- embryonic fibroblasts and kidney epithelial cells, we now demonstrate that deletion of PLSCR1 from the plasma membrane reduces the activation of c-Src by EGF, implying that PLSCR1 normally facilitates receptor-dependent activation of this kinase. We propose that PLSCR1, through its interaction with Shc, promotes Src kinase activation through the EGF receptor.",

        "Abstract": "The cyclin-dependent protein kinases are important targets in drug discovery because of their role in cell cycle regulation. In this computational study, we have applied a continuum solvent model to study the interactions between cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and analogues of the clinically tested anticancer agent flavopiridol. The continuum solvent model uses Coulomb's law to account for direct electrostatic interactions, solves the Poisson equation to obtain the electrostatic contributions to solvation energy, and calculates scaled solvent-accessible surface area to account for hydrophobic interactions. The computed free energy of binding gauges the strength of protein-ligand interactions. Our model was first validated through a study on the binding of a number of flavopiridol derivatives to CDK2, and its ability to identify potent inhibitors was observed. The model was then used to aid in the design of novel CDK2 inhibitors with the aid of a computational sensitivity analysis. Some of these hypothetical structures could be significantly more potent than the lead compound flavopiridol. We applied two approaches to gain insights into designing selective inhibitors. One relied on the comparative analysis of the binding pocket for several hundred protein kinases to identify the parts of a lead compound whose modifications might lead to selective compounds. The other was based on building and using homology models for energy calculations. The homology models appear to be able to classify ligand potency into groups but cannot yet give reliable quantitative results.",

        "Abstract": "beta-Site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme (BACE) is an integral membrane aspartic proteinase responsible for beta-site processing of APP, and its cytoplasmic region composed of 24 amino acid residues has been shown to be involved in the endosomal localization of BACE. With the yeast two-hybrid screening, we found that the cytoplasmic domain of phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), a type II integral membrane protein, interacts with the cytoplasmic region of BACE. In cultured cells, BACE and PLSCR1 were colocalized in the Golgi area and in endosomal compartments, whereas they were co-redistributed in late endosome-derived multivesicular bodies when treated with U18666A, suggesting that both proteins share a common trafficking pathway in cells. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that both proteins form a protein complex at an endogenous expression level in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Ycells, and the dileucine residue of the BACE tail is also revealed to be essential for the physical interaction with PLSCR1 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, both BACE and PLSCR1 were localized in a low buoyant lipid microdomain in SH-SY5Y cells. The dileucine-defective BACE mutant was also fractionated into the lipid microdomain, but much less stably than wild-type BACE. Taken together, our current study suggests the functional involvement of PLSCR1 in the intracellular distribution of BACE and/or recruitment of BACE into the detergent-insoluble lipid raft.",

        "Abstract": "Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is a Ca(2+)-binding, endofacial plasma membrane protein thought to contribute to the transbilayer movement of phosphatidylserine and other membrane phospholipids that is observed upon influx of calcium into the cytosol. Expression of PLSCR1 is markedly induced by interferon and other cytokines, and PLSCR1-/- bone marrow cells exhibit defective myeloid proliferation and differentiation in response to stimulation by select growth factors, implying that PLSCR1 also functions in cytokine signaling or response pathways. PLSCR1 is multiply palmitoylated and partitions into membrane lipid raft domains. We have now identified the Cys-rich sequence (184)CCCPCC(189) in PLSCR1 as required for palmitoylation of the polypeptide. Mutation of these five cysteines abrogates PLSCR1 trafficking to the plasma membrane and results in virtually all of the expressed protein localizing to the nucleus. Consistent with this observation, cell treatment with the palmitoylation inhibitor, 2-bromo-palmitate, results in a marked redistribution of endogenous PLSCR1 from plasma membrane to nucleus. In a small percentage of untreated cells, predominantly nuclear localization of PLSCR1 is also observed. Furthermore, PLSCR1 is also found in the nucleus following its cytokine-induced expression. These data suggest that under the circumstance of rapid biosynthesis in response to gene induction by cytokines, PLSCR1 traffics into the nucleus, implying a potential nuclear function for this protein.",

        "Title": "The B cell antigen receptor regulates the transcriptional activator beta-catenin via protein kinase C-mediated inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3.",
        "Abstract": "Beta-catenin is a transcriptional activator that is regulated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). GSK-3 is constitutively active in unstimulated cells where it phosphorylates beta-catenin, targeting beta-catenin for rapid degradation. Receptor-induced inhibition of GSK-3 allows beta-catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm and then translocate to the nucleus where it promotes the transcription of genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1. Wnt hormones, the best known regulators of beta-catenin, inhibit GSK-3 via the Disheveled protein. However, GSK-3 is also inhibited when it is phosphorylated by Akt, a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). We have previously shown that B cell Ag receptor (BCR) signaling leads to activation of PI3K and Akt as well as inhibition of GSK-3. Therefore, we hypothesized that BCR engagement would induce the accumulation of beta-catenin via a PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 pathway. We now show that BCR ligation causes an increase in the level of beta-catenin in the nuclear fraction of B cells as well as an increase in beta-catenin-dependent transcription. Direct inhibition of GSK-3 by LiCl also increased beta-catenin levels in B cells. This suggests that GSK-3 keeps beta-catenin levels low in unstimulated B cells and that BCR-induced inhibition of GSK-3 allows the accumulation of beta-catenin. Surprisingly, we found that the BCR-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3 on its negative regulatory sites, as well as the subsequent up-regulation of beta-catenin, was not mediated by Akt but by the phospholipase C-dependent activation of protein kinase C. Thus, the BCR regulates beta-catenin levels via a phospholipase C/protein kinase C/GSK-3 pathway.",

        "Title": "Normal hemostasis but defective hematopoietic response to growth factors in mice deficient in phospholipid scramblase 1.",
        "Abstract": "Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is an endofacial plasma membrane protein proposed to participate in transbilayer movement of phosphatidylserine and other phospholipids. In addition to its putative role in the reorganization of plasma membrane phospholipids, PLSCR1 is a substrate of intracellular kinases that imply its possible participation in diverse signaling pathways underlying proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis. Because PLSCR1 is prominently expressed in a variety of blood cells, we evaluated PLSCR activity in platelets and erythrocytes, and cytokine-dependent growth of hematopoietic precursor cells, of PLSCR1 knock-out mice. Adult PLSCR1(-/-) mice showed no obvious hematologic or hemostatic abnormality, and blood cells from these animals normally mobilized phosphatidylserine to the cell surface upon stimulation. Whereas blood cell counts in adult PLSCR1(-/-) mice were normal, in both fetus and newborn animals neutrophil counts were significantly depressed relative to age-matched wild type (WT). Furthermore, when compared with WT, hematopoietic precursor cells from PLSCR1(-/-) mice showed defective colony formation and impaired differentiation to mature granulocytes as stimulated by stem cell factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). By contrast, PLSCR1(-/-) cells showed normal colony formation stimulated by interleukin-3 or granulocyte-macrophage CSF, and expansion of megakaryocytic and erythroid progenitors by thrombopoietin or erythropoietin was unaffected. Stem cell factor and G-CSF were also found to induce marked increases in PLSCR1 levels in WT cells. Consistent with in vitro assays, PLSCR1(-/-) mice treated with G-CSF showed less than 50% of the granulocytosis observed in identically treated WT mice. These data provide direct evidence that PLSCR1 functionally contributes to cytokine-regulated cell proliferation and differentiation and suggest it is required for normal myelopoiesis.",

        "Title": "Plasma membrane phospholipid scramblase 1 is enriched in lipid rafts and interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor.",
        "Abstract": "We have identified physical and functional interactions between the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), an endofacial plasma membrane protein proposed to affect phospholipid organization. PLSCR1, a palmitoylated protein, was found to partition with the EGF receptor in membrane lipid rafts. Cell stimulation with EGF transiently elevated Tyr-phosphorylation of PLSCR1, peaking at 5 min. Although PLSCR1 is a known substrate of c-Abl [Sun, J., et al. (2001) J.Biol. Chem. 276, 28984-28990], the Abl inhibitor STI571 did not substantially affect its EGF-dependent phosphorylation, suggesting PLSCR1 is a substrate of the EGF receptor kinase, or another EGF-activated kinase. Coinciding with phosphorylation, there was a transient increase in physical association of PLSCR1 with both the EGF receptor and the adapter protein Shc, as determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Confocal immunofluorescence analysis revealed that EGF initiates rapid internalization of both the EGF receptor and PLSCR1, with trafficking into both distinct and common endosomal pools. These data also suggested that whereas the EGF receptor is ultimately degraded, much of the endocytosed PLSCR1 is recycled to the cell surface within 3 h after EGF treatment. Consistent with this interpretation, Western blotting revealed neither ubiquitination nor proteolysis of PLSCR1 under these conditions, whereas the ubiquitination and degradation of the EGF receptor were readily confirmed. Finally, stimulation with EGF was also found to markedly increase the total cellular expression of PLSCR1, suggesting that in addition to its initial interactions with activated EGF receptor, PLSCR1 may also contribute to posttranscriptional effector pathway(s) mediating the cellular response to EGF.",

        "Abstract": "Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is an IFN-inducible, endofacial plasma membrane protein that has been proposed to mediate accelerated transbilayer movement of plasma membrane phospholipids in cells exposed to elevated cytoplasmic [Ca (2+)]. The marked transcriptional up-regulation of this gene by IFN in a wide variety of cell types suggested that PLSCR1 might also contribute to biological effects associated with IFN. To study the potential contribution of cellular PLSCR1 to the antiproliferative and tumor-suppressive activities of IFN, PLSCR1 cDNA was stably expressed in the human ovarian cancer cell line HEY1B, and the growth of these cells was compared with matched vector transfected controls both in vitro and in vivo. Whereas we detected no difference in either growth rate or morphology between PLSCR1-transfected cells and vector controls during in vitro culture in serum, when these cells were implanted s.c. into athymic nude mice, we observed a marked suppression of tumor development from cells transfected to express elevated levels of PLSCR1. Tumors from the PLSCR1-transfected cells were greatly reduced in size, showed increased infiltration of leukocytes and macrophages, and appeared to undergo differentiation to a more uniform and spindle-shaped morphology that markedly contrasted the highly undifferentiated and pleiomorphic cell shape normally observed for HEY1B cells in vitro or for vector-transfected control HEY1B cells both in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that the up-regulation of PLSCR1 expression in tumor cells exposed to IFN may contribute to the observed tumor-suppressive action of this cytokine.",
