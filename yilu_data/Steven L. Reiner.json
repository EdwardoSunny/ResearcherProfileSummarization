        "Abstract": "The cell-autonomous balance of immune-inhibitory and -stimulatory signals is a critical process in cancer immune evasion. Using patient-derived co-cultures, humanized mouse models, and single-cell RNA-sequencing of patient melanomas biopsied before and on immune checkpoint blockade, we find that intact cancer cell-intrinsic expression of CD58 and ligation to CD2 is required for anti-tumor immunity and is predictive of treatment response. Defects in this axis promote immune evasion through diminished T\u00a0cell activation, impaired intratumoral T\u00a0cell infiltration and proliferation, and concurrently increased PD-L1 protein stabilization. Through CRISPR-Cas9 and proteomics screens, we identify and validate CMTM6 as critical for CD58 stability and upregulation of PD-L1 upon CD58 loss. Competition between CD58 and PD-L1 for CMTM6 binding determines their rate of endosomal recycling over lysosomal degradation. Overall, we describe an underappreciated yet critical axis of cancer immunity and provide a molecular basis for how cancer cells balance immune inhibitory and stimulatory cues.",

The clinical potential of these agents is limited by the fact that half of all patients develop immune-related adverse events (irAEs). To generate insights into the cellular changes that occur during anti-PD-1 treatment, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of circulating T\u00a0cells collected from patients with cancer. Using the K-nearest-neighbor-based network graph-drawing layout, we show the involvement of distinctive genes and subpopulations of T\u00a0cells.

        "Abstract": "Treatment with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) often fails to elicit durable antitumor immunity. Recent studies suggest that ICB does not restore potency to terminally dysfunctional T cells, but instead drives proliferation and differentiation of self-renewing progenitor T cells into fresh, effector-like T cells. Antitumor immunity catalyzed by ICB is characterized by mobilization of antitumor T cells in systemic circulation and tumor. To address whether abundance of self-renewing T cells in blood is associated with immunotherapy response, we used flow cytometry of peripheral blood from a cohort of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with ICB. At baseline, expression of T-cell factor 1 (TCF1), a marker of self-renewing T cells, was detected at higher frequency in effector-memory (CCR7-) CD8+ T cells from patients who experienced durable clinical benefit compared to those with primary resistance to ICB. On-treatment blood samples from patients benefiting from ICB also exhibited a greater frequency of TCF1+CCR7-CD8+ T cells and higher proportions of TCF1 expression in treatment-expanded PD-1+CCR7-CD8+ T cells. The observed correlation of TCF1 frequency in CCR7-CD8+ T cells and response to ICB suggests that broader examination of self-renewing T-cell abundance in blood will determine its potential as a noninvasive, predictive biomarker of response and resistance to immunotherapy.",

GC is an important area of focus of the medical community, given its often late-stage of diagnosis and associated high mortality rate. While surgery and chemotherapy remain the primary treatments, attention has been drawn to the use of immunologic therapies, which have shown promise in the treatment of other malignancies. The role for immune-based therapies has become clearer as we obtain a greater understanding of the role of the immune system in gastric cancer formation and growth. A variety treatment to augment the immune system are under evaluation in clinical trials, and these include immune checkpoint inhibitors, antibody-drug conjugates, and immune cell-based therapies. Here, we review the immune landscape and immune-based therapies for GC.",

        "Abstract": "How intestinal microbes regulate metabolic syndrome is incompletely understood. We show that intestinal microbiota protects against development of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and pre-diabetic phenotypes by inducing commensal-specific Th17 cells. High-fat, high-sugar diet promoted metabolic disease by depleting Th17-inducing microbes, and recovery of commensal Th17 cells restored protection. Microbiota-induced Th17 cells afforded protection by regulating lipid absorption across intestinal epithelium in an IL-17-dependent manner. Diet-induced loss of protective Th17 cells was mediated by the presence of sugar. Eliminating sugar from high-fat diets protected mice from obesity and metabolic syndrome in a manner dependent on commensal-specific Th17 cells. Sugar and ILC3 promoted outgrowth of Faecalibaculum rodentium that displaced Th17-inducing microbiota. These results define dietary and microbiota factors posing risk for metabolic syndrome. They also define a microbiota-dependent mechanism for immuno-pathogenicity of dietary sugar and highlight an elaborate interaction between diet, microbiota, and intestinal immunity in regulation of metabolic disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Heightened immunity after a primary infection, persistent control of low-level infection, or vanquished immunity from chronic-active infection and cancer are interrelated issues concerning the nature of T-cell regeneration during immunity. For many regenerating tissues and cellular systems, such as epithelia and blood, there are at least three distinguishable stages of development and repair, marked by progressive loss of self-renewal and progressive commitment to differentiation. T cells seem to be no different. Quiescent precursors become activated and yield anabolic, proliferative progenitors while self-renewing the quiescent precursor population. Activated progenitors then yield differentiated cellular descendants alongside the self-renewal of progenitors. Nomenclature reflecting the mutually opposing nature of T-cell self-renewal and T-cell differentiation would help synchronize phenomena such as T-cell memory, protective immunity, and T-cell exhaustion with other regenerative paradigms, as well as offer new strategies to influence the intensity and duration of immunity.",

        "Abstract": "Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) accelerate pathogen clearance through rapid and enhanced functional responses in situ. TRMs are prevalent in diverse anatomic sites throughout the human lifespan, yet their phenotypic and functional diversity has not been fully described. Here, we identify subpopulations of human TRMs based on the ability to efflux fluorescent dyes [efflux(+) TRMs] located within mucosal and lymphoid sites with distinct transcriptional profiles, turnover, and functional capacities. Compared with efflux(-) TRMs, efflux(+) TRMs showed transcriptional and phenotypic features of quiescence including reduced turnover, decreased expression of exhaustion markers, and increased proliferative capacity and signaling in response to homeostatic cytokines. Moreover, upon activation, efflux(+) TRMs secreted lower levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 and underwent reduced degranulation. Interestingly, analysis of TRM subsets following activation revealed that both efflux(+) and efflux(-) TRMs undergo extensive transcriptional changes following TCR ligation but retain core TRM transcriptional properties including retention markers, suggesting that TRMs carry out effector function in situ. Overall, our results suggest a model for tissue-resident immunity wherein heterogeneous subsets have differential capacities for longevity and effector function.",

        "Abstract": "Growth signals drive hematopoietic progenitor cells to proliferate and branch into divergent cell fates, but how unequal outcomes arise from a common progenitor is not fully understood. We used steady-state analysis of in vivo hematopoiesis and Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L)-induced in vitro differentiation of dendritic cells (DCs) to determine how growth signals regulate lineage bias. We found that Flt3L signaling induced anabolic activation and proliferation of DC progenitors, which was associated with DC differentiation. Perturbation of processes associated with quiescence and catabolism, including AMP-activated protein kinase signaling, fatty acid oxidation, or mitochondrial clearance increased development of cDC2 cells at the expense of cDC1 cells. Conversely, scavenging anabolism-associated reactive oxygen species skewed differentiation toward cDC1 cells. Sibling daughter cells of dividing DC progenitors exhibited unequal expression of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8, which correlated with clonal divergence in FoxO3a signaling and population-level bifurcation of cell fate. We propose that unequal transmission of growth signals during cell division might support fate branches during proliferative expansion of progenitors.",

Divergent cellular anabolism versus catabolism is emerging as a feature of several developmental and regenerative paradigms. Metabolism can dictate cell fate, in part, because lineage-specific regulators are embedded in the circuitry of conserved metabolic switches. Unequal transmission of PI3K signaling during regenerative divisions is reminiscent of compartmentalized PI3K activity during directed motility or polarized information flow in non-dividing cells. The diverse roles of PI3K pathways in membrane traffic, cell polarity, metabolism, and gene expression may have converged to instruct sibling cell feast and famine, thereby enabling clonal differentiation alongside self-renewal.",

        "Abstract": "Regeneration requires related cells to diverge in fate. We show that activated lymphocytes yield sibling cells with unequal elimination of aged mitochondria. Disparate mitochondrial clearance impacts cell fate and reflects larger constellations of opposing metabolic states. Differentiation driven by an anabolic constellation of PI3K/mTOR activation, aerobic glycolysis, inhibited autophagy, mitochondrial stasis, and ROS production is balanced with self-renewal maintained by a catabolic constellation of AMPK activation, mitochondrial elimination, oxidative metabolism, and maintenance of FoxO1 activity. Perturbations up and down the metabolic pathways shift the balance of nutritive constellations and cell fate owing to self-reinforcement and reciprocal inhibition between anabolism and catabolism. Cell fate and metabolic state are linked by transcriptional regulators, such as IRF4 and FoxO1, with dual roles in lineage and metabolic choice. Instructing some cells to utilize nutrients for anabolism and differentiation while other cells catabolically self-digest and self-renew may enable growth and repair in metazoa.",

        "Abstract": "The role of Ab and B cells in preventing infection is established. In contrast, the role of B cell responses in containing chronic infections remains poorly understood. IgG2a (IgG1 in humans) can prevent acute infections, and T-bet promotes IgG2a isotype switching. However, whether IgG2a and B cell-expressed T-bet influence the host-pathogen balance during persisting infections is unclear. We demonstrate that B cell-specific loss of T-bet prevents control of persisting viral infection. T-bet in B cells controlled IgG2a production, as well as mucosal localization, proliferation, glycosylation, and a broad transcriptional program. T-bet controlled a broad antiviral program in addition to IgG2a because T-bet in B cells was important, even in the presence of virus-specific IgG2a. Our data support a model in which T-bet is a universal controller of antiviral immunity across multiple immune lineages.",

        "Abstract": "A common genetic alteration in acute myeloid leukemia is the internal tandem duplication (ITD) in FLT3, the receptor for cytokine FLT3 ligand (FLT3L). Constitutively active FLT3-ITD promotes the expansion of transformed progenitors, but also has pleiotropic effects on hematopoiesis. We analyzed the effect of FLT3-ITD on dendritic cells (DCs), which express FLT3 and can be expanded by FLT3L administration. Pre-leukemic mice with the Flt3(ITD) knock-in allele manifested an expansion of classical DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs. The expansion originated in DC progenitors, was cell intrinsic, and was further enhanced in Flt3(ITD/ITD) mice. The mutation caused the down-regulation of Flt3 on the surface of DCs and reduced their responsiveness to Flt3L. Both canonical Batf3-dependent CD8(+) cDCs and noncanonical CD8(+) cDCs were expanded and showed specific alterations in their expression profiles. Flt3(ITD) mice showed enhanced capacity to support T cell proliferation, including a cell-extrinsic expansion of regulatory T (T reg) cells. Accordingly, these mice restricted alloreactive T cell responses during graft-versus-host reaction, but failed to control autoimmunity without T reg cells. Thus, the FLT3-ITD mutation directly affects DC development, indirectly modulating T cell homeostasis and supporting T reg cell expansion. We hypothesize that this effect of FLT3-ITD might subvert immunosurveillance and promote leukemogenesis in a cell-extrinsic manner.",

        "Abstract": "Type 1 innate lymphocytes comprise two developmentally divergent lineages, type 1 helper innate lymphoid cells (hILC1s) and conventional NK cells (cNKs). All type 1 innate lymphocytes (ILCs) express the transcription factor T-bet, but cNKs additionally express Eomesodermin (Eomes). We show that deletion of Eomes alleles at the onset of type 1 ILC maturation using NKp46-Cre imposes a substantial block in cNK development. Formation of the entire lymphoid and nonlymphoid type 1 ILC compartment appears to require the semiredundant action of both T-bet and Eomes. To determine if Eomes is sufficient to redirect hILC1 development to a cNK fate, we generated transgenic mice that express Eomes when and where T-bet is expressed using Tbx21 locus control to drive expression of Eomes codons. Ectopic Eomes induces cNK-like properties across the lymphoid and nonlymphoid type 1 ILC compartments. Subsequent to their divergent lineage specification, hILC1s and cNKs thus possess substantial developmental plasticity.",

        "Abstract": "Metazoan sibling cells often diverge in activity and identity, suggesting links between growth signals and cell fate. We show that unequal transduction of nutrient-sensitive PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling during cell division bifurcates transcriptional networks and fates of kindred cells. A sibling B lymphocyte with stronger signaling, indexed by FoxO1 inactivation and IRF4 induction, undergoes PI3K-driven Pax5 repression and plasma cell determination, while its sibling with weaker PI3K activity renews a memory or germinal center B cell fate. PI3K-driven effector T cell determination silences TCF1 in one sibling cell, while its PI3K-attenuated sibling self-renews in tandem. Prior to bifurcations achieving irreversible plasma or effector cell fate determination, asymmetric signaling during initial divisions specifies a more proliferative, differentiation-prone lymphocyte in tandem with a more quiescent memory cell sibling. By triggering cell division but transmitting unequal intensity between sibling cells, nutrient-sensitive signaling may be a frequent arbiter of cell fate bifurcations during development and repair.",

        "Abstract": "The transcription factor T-bet has been most prominently linked to NK and T cell production of IFN-\u03b3, a cytokine required for the control of a diverse array of intracellular pathogens. Indeed, in mice challenged with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, NK and T cell responses are characterized by marked increases of T-bet expression. Unexpectedly, T-bet(-/-) mice infected with T. gondii develop a strong NK cell IFN-\u03b3 response that controls parasite replication at the challenge site, but display high parasite burdens at secondary sites colonized by T. gondii and succumb to infection. The loss of T-bet had a modest effect on T cell production of IFN-\u03b3 but did not impact on the generation of parasite-specific T cells. However, the absence of T-bet resulted in lower T cell expression of CD11a, Ly6C, KLRG-1, and CXCR3 and fewer parasite-specific T cells at secondary sites of infection, associated with a defect in parasite control at these sites. Together, these data highlight T-bet-independent pathways to IFN-\u03b3 production and reveal a novel role for this transcription factor in coordinating the T cell responses necessary to control this infection in peripheral tissues.",

        "Abstract": "The cellular progeny of a clonally selected lymphocyte must execute function. However, their function must often occur in more than one way, in more than one place and at more than one time. Experimental evidence supports the view that a single activated lymphocyte can produce a variety of cellular descendants. The mechanisms that are responsible for generating diversity among the progeny of a single lymphocyte remain a subject of lively controversy. Some groups have suggested stochastic mechanisms that are analogous to the diversification of the antigen receptor repertoire. We suggest that the complexity of lymphocyte fates in space and time can be derived from a single naive lymphocyte using the principles of cell diversification that are common in developmental and regenerative biology, including (but not limited to) asymmetric cell division.",

We tested the consequence of conditional deletion of the bone marrow homing receptor CXCR4 on antiviral T cell responses. CXCR4-deficient CD8(+) T cells have impaired memory cell maintenance due to defective homeostatic proliferation. Upon rechallenge, however, CXCR4-deficient T cells can re-expand and renew the CM pool while producing secondary effector cells. The critical bone marrow-derived signals essential for CD8(+) T cell homeostatic self-renewal appear to be dispensable to yield self-renewing, functionally asymmetric cell fates during rechallenge.",

        "Abstract": "4-1BB agonist antibody treatment induces a population of KLRG1(+) T cells that infiltrate melanoma tumors. We investigated the origin and function of these cells, as well as their place within established T cell paradigms. We find that these T cells, particularly the CD4 lineage, represent a novel phenotype characterized by enhanced, multipotent cytotoxicity. Distinct from described polarities, this T cell phenotype is driven by the T-box transcription factor Eomesodermin. Formation of this phenotype requires 4-1BB signaling on both T and antigen-presenting cells and the resulting production of the cytokines IL-27, IL-15, and IL-10. Furthermore, we find CD4(+) T cells bearing the signature features of this phenotype in the livers of mice infected with both bacterial and viral intracellular pathogens, suggesting a role for these cells in infectious immunity. These T cells constitute a novel phenotype that resolves multiple questions associated with 4-1BB activation, including how 4-1BB enhances tumor-specific cytotoxicity and how 4-1BB can promote tumor immunity while repressing autoimmunity.",

        "Abstract": "The dentate gyrus (DG) is a unique cortical region whose protracted development spans the embryonic and early postnatal periods. DG development involves large-scale reorganization of progenitor cell populations, ultimately leading to the establishment of the subgranular zone neurogenic niche. In the developing DG, the T-box transcription factor Tbr2 is expressed in both Cajal-Retzius cells derived from the cortical hem that guide migration of progenitors and neurons to the DG, and intermediate neuronal progenitors born in the dentate neuroepithelium that give rise to granule neurons. Here we show that in mice Tbr2 is required for proper migration of Cajal-Retzius cells to the DG; and, in the absence of Tbr2, formation of the hippocampal fissure is abnormal, leading to aberrant development of the transhilar radial glial scaffold and impaired migration of progenitors and neuroblasts to the developing DG. Furthermore, loss of Tbr2 results in decreased expression of Cxcr4 in migrating cells, leading to a premature burst of granule neurogenesis during early embryonic development accompanied by increased cell death in mutant animals. Formation of the transient subpial neurogenic zone was abnormal in Tbr2 conditional knock-outs, and the stem cell population in the DG was depleted before proper establishment of the subgranular zone. These studies indicate that Tbr2 is explicitly required for morphogenesis of the DG and participates in multiple aspects of the intricate developmental process of this structure.",

        "Abstract": "The cortical area map is initially patterned by transcription factor (TF) gradients in the neocortical primordium, which define a \"protomap\" in the embryonic ventricular zone (VZ). However, mechanisms that propagate regional identity from VZ progenitors to cortical plate (CP) neurons are unknown. Here we show that the VZ, subventricular zone (SVZ), and CP contain distinct molecular maps of regional identity, reflecting different gene expression gradients in radial glia progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and projection neurons, respectively. The \"intermediate map\" in the SVZ is modulated by Eomes (also known as Tbr2), a T-box TF. Eomes inactivation caused rostrocaudal shifts in SVZ and CP gene expression, with loss of corticospinal axons and gain of corticotectal projections. These findings suggest that cortical areas and connections are shaped by sequential maps of regional identity, propagated by the Pax6 \u2192 Eomes \u2192 Tbr1 TF cascade. In humans, PAX6, EOMES, and TBR1 have been linked to intellectual disability and autism.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic infections strain the regenerative capacity of antiviral T lymphocyte populations, leading to failure in long-term immunity. The cellular and molecular events controlling this regenerative capacity, however, are unknown. We found that two distinct states of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells exist in chronically infected mice and humans. Differential expression of the T-box transcription factors T-bet and Eomesodermin (Eomes) facilitated the cooperative maintenance of the pool of antiviral CD8(+) T cells during chronic viral infection. T-bet(hi) cells displayed low intrinsic turnover but proliferated in response to persisting antigen, giving rise to Eomes(hi) terminal progeny. Genetic elimination of either subset resulted in failure to control chronic infection, which suggests that an imbalance in differentiation and renewal could underlie the collapse of immunity in humans with chronic infections.",

Identification and separation of cells with differential Eomes expression would allow for better understanding of the transcriptional program governing these cytotoxic lymphocytes. Here, we report the use of an Eomes(gfp)-targeted mouse allele that displays robust fidelity to Eomes protein expression in NK and T cells. Use of this reporter mouse revealed that Eomes expression in antiviral effector cells did not correlate with enhanced cytotoxicity but rather was associated with more efficient central memory differentiation. Weakening of reporter activity in Eomes-deficient CD8(+) T cells revealed a critical role for Eomes protein in maintaining central memory cells that have activated the Eomes locus. Characterization of reporter activity in NK lineage cells also permitted identification of a novel intermediate of NK cell maturation. Thus, the murine Eomes(gfp)-targeted allele provides a novel opportunity to explore Eomes biology in cytotoxic lymphocytes.",

Our studies demonstrate that interleukin-27 (IL-27) also promoted expression of T-bet and CXCR3 in Treg cells. During infection with Toxoplasma gondii, a similar population emerged that limited T\u00a0cell responses and was dependent on IFN-\u03b3 in the periphery but on IL-27 at mucosal sites. Transfer of Treg cells ameliorated the infection-induced pathology observed in Il27(-/-) mice, and this was dependent on their ability to produce IL-10. Microarray analysis revealed that Treg cells exposed to either IFN-\u03b3 or IL-27 have distinct transcriptional profiles. Thus, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-27 have different roles in Treg cell biology and IL-27 is a key cytokine that promotes the development of Treg cells specialized to control Th1 cell-mediated immunity at local sites of inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "Antibody class defines function in B cell immunity, but how class is propagated into B cell memory remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that memory B cell subsets unexpectedly diverged across antibody class through differences in the effects of major transcriptional regulators. Conditional genetic deletion of the gene encoding the transcription factor T-bet selectively blocked the formation and antigen-specific response of memory B cells expressing immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) in vivo. Cell-intrinsic expression of T-bet regulated expression of the transcription factor STAT1, steady-state cell survival and transcription of IgG2a-containing B cell antigen receptors (BCRs). In contrast, the transcription factor ROR\u03b1 and not T-bet was expressed in IgA(+) memory B cells, with evidence that knockdown of ROR\u03b1 mRNA expression and chemical inhibition of transcriptional activity also resulted in lower survival and BCR expression of IgA(+) memory B cells. Thus, divergent transcriptional regulators dynamically maintain subset integrity to promote specialized immune function in class-specific memory B cells.",

        "Abstract": "Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus has been implicated in cognitive functions, including learning and memory, and may be abnormal in major neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression. Dentate neurogenesis is regulated by interactions between extrinsic factors and intrinsic transcriptional cascades that are currently not well understood. Here we show that Tbr2 (also known as Eomes), a T-box transcription factor expressed by intermediate neuronal progenitors (INPs), is critically required for neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of developing and adult mice. In the absence of Tbr2, INPs are depleted despite augmented neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation, and neurogenesis is halted as the result of failed neuronal differentiation. Interestingly, we find that Tbr2 likely promotes lineage progression from NSC to neuronal-specified INP in part by repression of Sox2, a key determinant of NSC identity. These findings suggest that Tbr2 expression in INPs is critical for neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus and that INPs are an essential stage in the lineage from NSCs to new granule neurons in the dentate gyrus.",

        "Abstract": "Clonal selection of a T cell for use in the immune response appears to necessitate proliferative expansion and terminal effector differentiation of some cellular progeny, while reserving other progeny as less-differentiated memory cells. It has been suggested that asymmetric cell division may promote initial cell diversification. Stem cell-like models of adaptive immunity might predict that subsequent encounters with a pathogen would evoke reiterative, self-renewing, asymmetric division by memory T cells. In this study, we show that murine memory CD8(+) T cells can divide asymmetrically in response to secondary encounter with pathogen. Critical regulators of signaling and transcription are partitioned to one side of the mitotic spindle in rechallenged memory T cells, and two phenotypically distinct populations of daughter cells are evident from the earliest divisions. Memory T cells may thus use asymmetric cell division to generate cellular heterogeneity when faced with pathogen rechallenge.",

        "Abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells play critical roles defending against tumors and pathogens. We show that mice lacking both transcription factors Eomesodermin (Eomes) and T-bet failed to develop NK cells. Developmental stability of immature NK cells constitutively expressing the death ligand TRAIL depended on T-bet. Conversely, maturation characterized by loss of constitutive TRAIL expression and induction of Ly49 receptor diversity and integrin CD49b (DX5(+)) required Eomes. Mature NK cells from which Eomes was deleted reverted to phenotypic immaturity if T-bet was present or downregulated NK lineage antigens if T-bet was absent, despite retaining expression of Ly49 receptors. Fetal and adult hepatic hematopoiesis restricted Eomes expression and limited NK development to the T-bet-dependent, immature stage, whereas medullary hematopoiesis permitted Eomes-dependent NK maturation in adult mice. These findings reveal two sequential, genetically separable checkpoints of NK cell maturation, the progression of which is metered largely by the anatomic localization of hematopoiesis.",

        "Abstract": "Lifelong antibody responses to vaccination require reorganization of lymphoid tissue and dynamic intercellular communication called the germinal center reaction. B lymphocytes undergo cellular polarization during antigen stimulation, acquisition, and presentation, which are critical steps for initiating humoral immunity. Here, we show that germinal center B lymphocytes asymmetrically segregate the transcriptional regulator Bcl6, the receptor for interleukin-21, and the ancestral polarity protein atypical protein kinase C to one side of the plane of division, generating unequal inheritance of fate-altering molecules by daughter cells. Germinal center B lymphocytes from mice with a defect in leukocyte adhesion fail to divide asymmetrically. These results suggest that motile cells lacking constitutive attachment can receive provisional polarity cues from the microenvironment to generate daughter cell diversity and self-renewal.",

        "Abstract": "Cytotoxic CD4 Th1 cells are emerging as a therapeutically useful T cell lineage that can effectively target tumors, but until now the pathways that govern their differentiation have been poorly understood. We demonstrate that CD134 (OX40) costimulation programs naive self- and virus-reactive CD4 T cells to undergo in vivo differentiation into cytotoxic Th1 effectors. CD137 (4-1BB) costimulation maximized clonal expansion, and IL-2 was necessary for cytotoxic Th1 differentiation. Importantly, the T-box transcription factor Eomesodermin was critical for inducing the cytotoxic marker granzyme B. CD134 plus CD137 dual costimulation also imprinted a cytotoxic phenotype on bystanding CD4 T cells. Thus, to our knowledge, the current study identifies for the first time a specific costimulatory pathway and an intracellular mechanism relying on Eomesodermin that induces both Ag-specific and bystander cytotoxic CD4 Th1 cells. This mechanism might be therapeutically useful because CD134 plus CD137 dual costimulation induced CD4 T cell-dependent tumoricidal function in a mouse melanoma model.",

        "Abstract": "T cell exhaustion has a major role in failure to control chronic infection. High expression of inhibitory receptors, including PD-1, and the inability to sustain functional T cell responses contribute to exhaustion. However, the transcriptional control of these processes remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor T-bet regulated the exhaustion of CD8(+) T cells and the expression of inhibitory receptors. T-bet directly repressed transcription of the gene encoding PD-1 and resulted in lower expression of other inhibitory receptors. Although a greater abundance of T-bet promoted terminal differentiation after acute infection, high T-bet expression sustained exhausted CD8(+) T cells and repressed the expression of inhibitory receptors during chronic viral infection. Persistent antigenic stimulation caused downregulation of T-bet, which resulted in more severe exhaustion of CD8(+) T cells. Our observations suggest therapeutic opportunities involving higher T-bet expression during chronic infection.",

        "Abstract": "Polarized segregation of proteins in T cells is thought to play a role in diverse cellular functions including signal transduction, migration, and directed secretion of cytokines. Persistence of this polarization can result in asymmetric segregation of fate-determining proteins during cell division, which may enable a T cell to generate diverse progeny. Here, we provide evidence that a lineage-determining transcription factor, T-bet, underwent asymmetric organization in activated T cells preparing to divide and that it was unequally partitioned into the two daughter cells. This unequal acquisition of T-bet appeared to result from its asymmetric destruction during mitosis by virtue of concomitant asymmetric segregation of the proteasome. These results suggest a mechanism by which a cell may unequally localize cellular activities during division, thereby imparting disparity in the abundance of cell fate regulators in the daughter cells.",

        "Abstract": "Conventional and nonconventional T cell development occur in the thymus. Nonconventional thymocytes that bear characteristics typically associated with innate immune cells are termed innate-like lymphocytes (ILLs). Mice harboring a tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation in the adaptor protein Src homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa at residue 145 (Y145F mice) develop an expanded population of CD8(+)CD122(+)CD44(+) ILLs, typified by expression of the T-box transcription factor eomesodermin. Y145F mice also have an expanded population of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells that produce copious amounts of IL-4 via a mechanism that is dependent on the BTB-ZF transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger. Using mice with T cell-specific deletion of Eomes, we demonstrate that this transcription factor is required for CD8(+) ILL development in Y145F as well as wild-type mice. Moreover, we show that promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger and IL-4 are also required for the generation of this ILL population. Taken together, these data shed light on the cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors that drive CD8(+) ILL differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "A hallmark of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), caused by mutation of the Fas death receptor, is massive lymphadenopathy from aberrant expansion of CD4(-)CD8(-) (double-negative [DN]) T cells. Eomesodermin (Eomes) is a member of the T-box family of transcription factors and plays critical roles in effector cell function and memory cell fitness of CD8(+) T lymphocytes. We provide evidence in this study that DN T cells exhibit dysregulated expression of Eomes in humans and mice with ALPS. We also find that T cell-specific deletion of Eomes prevents lymphoid hypertrophy and accumulation of DN T cells in Fas-mutant mice. Although Eomes has critical physiological roles in the function and homeostasis of CD8(+) T cells, overexpression of Eomes appears to enable pathological induction or expansion of unusual CD8-related T cell subsets. Thus, antagonism of Eomes emerges as a therapeutic target for DN T cell ablation in ALPS.",

T-bet and eomesodermin (Eomes) are key transcription factors of cytotoxic lymphocyte lineages. We show in this study that CD8(+) T cells lacking Eomes compete poorly in contributing to the pool of Ag-specific central memory cells. Eomes-deficient CD8(+) T cells undergo primary clonal expansion but are defective in long-term survival, populating the bone marrow niche and re-expanding postrechallenge. The phenotype of Eomes-deficient CD8(+) T cells supports the hypothesis that T-bet and Eomes can act redundantly to induce effector functions, but can also act to reciprocally promote terminal differentiation versus self-renewal of Ag-specific memory cells.",

Defining the molecular mechanisms that underlie asymmetric division of T cells is paramount for determining the role of this process in the generation of effector and memory T cell subsets. In other cell types, asymmetric cell division is regulated by conserved polarity protein complexes that control the localization of cell fate determinants and spindle orientation during division. We have developed a tractable, in vitro model of naive CD8(+) T cells undergoing initial division while attached to dendritic cells during Ag presentation to investigate whether similar mechanisms might regulate asymmetric division of T cells. Using this system, we show that direct interactions with APCs provide the cue for polarization of T cells. Interestingly, the immunological synapse disseminates before division even though the T cells retain contact with the APC. The cue from the APC is translated into polarization of cell fate determinants via the polarity network of the Par3 and Scribble complexes, and orientation of the mitotic spindle during division is orchestrated by the partner of inscuteable/G protein complex. These findings suggest that T cells have selectively adapted a number of evolutionarily conserved mechanisms to generate diversity through asymmetric cell division.",

        "Abstract": "Micro-RNA (miR) are increasingly recognized as critical regulators of tissue-specific patterns of gene expression. CD4+ T cells lacking miR-155, for example, exhibit bias towards Th2 differentiation, indicating that the absence of individual miR could alter CD4+ T-cell differentiation. We now show that miR-155 is induced upon T-cell activation and that it promotes Th1 differentiation when over-expressed in activated CD4+ T cells. Antagonism of miR-155 leads to induction of IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain (IFN-gammaRalpha), and a functional miR-155 target site is identified within the 3' untranslated region of IFN-gammaRalpha. These results identify IFN-gammaRalpha as a second miR-155 target in T cells and suggest that miR-155 contributes to Th1 differentiation in CD4+ T cells by inhibiting IFN-gamma signaling.",

        "Title": "T-bet-dependent S1P5 expression in NK cells promotes egress from lymph nodes and bone marrow.",
        "Abstract": "During a screen for ethylnitrosourea-induced mutations in mice affecting blood natural killer (NK) cells, we identified a strain, designated Duane, in which NK cells were reduced in blood and spleen but increased in lymph nodes (LNs) and bone marrow (BM). The accumulation of NK cells in LNs reflected a decreased ability to exit into lymph. This strain carries a point mutation within Tbx21 (T-bet), which generates a defective protein. Duane NK cells have a 30-fold deficiency in sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 5 (S1P5) transcript levels, and S1P5-deficient mice exhibit an egress defect similar to Duane. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirms binding of T-bet to the S1pr5 locus. S1P-deficient mice exhibit a more severe NK cell egress block, and the FTY720-sensitive S1P1 also plays a role in NK cell egress from LNs. S1P5 is not inhibited by CD69, a property that may facilitate trafficking of activated NK cells to effector sites. Finally, the accumulation of NK cells within BM of S1P-deficient mice was associated with reduced numbers in BM sinusoids, suggesting a role for S1P in BM egress. In summary, these findings identify S1P5 as a T-bet-induced gene that is required for NK cell egress from LNs and BM.",

        "Abstract": "T cell exhaustion is common during chronic infections and can prevent optimal immunity. Although recent studies have demonstrated the importance of inhibitory receptors and other pathways in T cell exhaustion, the underlying transcriptional mechanisms are unknown. Here, we define a role for the transcription factor Blimp-1 in CD8(+) T cell exhaustion during chronic viral infection. Blimp-1 repressed key aspects of normal memory CD8(+) T cell differentiation and promoted high expression of inhibitory receptors during chronic infection. These cardinal features of CD8(+) T cell exhaustion were corrected by conditionally deleting Blimp-1. Although high expression of Blimp-1 fostered aspects of CD8(+) T cell exhaustion, haploinsufficiency indicated that moderate Blimp-1 expression sustained some effector function during chronic viral infection. Thus, we identify Blimp-1 as a transcriptional regulator of CD8(+) T cell exhaustion during chronic viral infection and propose that Blimp-1 acts as a transcriptional rheostat balancing effector function and T cell exhaustion.",

        "Title": "KLF2 transcription-factor deficiency in T cells results in unrestrained cytokine production and upregulation of bystander chemokine receptors.",
        "Abstract": "The transcription factor KLF2 regulates T cell trafficking by promoting expression of the lipid-binding receptor S1P(1) and the selectin CD62L. Recently, it was proposed that KLF2 also represses the expression of chemokine receptors. We confirmed the upregulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 on KLF2-deficient T cells. However, we showed that this was a cell-nonautonomous effect, as revealed by CXCR3 upregulation on wild-type bystander cells in mixed bone-marrow chimeras with KLF2-deficient cells. Furthermore, KLF2-deficient T cells overproduced IL-4, leading to the upregulation of CXCR3 through an IL-4-receptor- and eomesodermin-dependent pathway. Consistent with the increased IL-4 production, we found high concentrations of serum IgE in mice with T cell-specific KLF2 deficiency. Our findings support a model where KLF2 regulates T cell trafficking by direct regulation of S1P(1) and CD62L and restrains spontaneous cytokine production in naive T cells.",

        "Abstract": "In addition to their well-established role as regulators of allergic response, recent evidence supports a role for mast cells in influencing the outcome of physiologic and pathologic T cell responses. One mechanism by which mast cells (MCs) influence T cell function is indirectly through secretion of various cytokines. It remains unclear, however, whether MCs can directly activate T cells through Ag presentation, as the expression of MHC class II by MCs has been controversial. In this report, we demonstrate that in vitro stimulation of mouse MCs with LPS and IFN-gamma induces the expression of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules. Although freshly isolated peritoneal MCs do not express MHC class II, an in vivo inflammatory stimulus increases the number of MHC class II-positive MCs in situ. Expression of MHC class II granted MCs the ability to process and present Ags directly to T cells with preferential expansion of Ag-specific regulatory T cells over naive T cells. These data support the notion that, in the appropriate setting, MCs may regulate T cell responses through the direct presentation of Ag.",

        "Abstract": "CD8(+) T lymphocytes are required for effective host defense against pathogens and also for mediating effector responses against uncontrolled proliferating self-tissues. In this study, we determine that individual CD8(+) T cells are tightly controlled in their effector functions by CD152 (CTLA-4). We demonstrate that signals induced by CD152 reduce the frequency of IFN-gamma and granzyme B expressing CD8(+) T cells independently of the transcription factors T-bet or cKrox by selectively inhibiting accumulation of Eomesodermin mRNA and protein. Ectopic expression of Eomesodermin reversed the CD152-mediated inhibition of effector molecule production. Additionally, enhanced cytotoxicity of individual CD8(+) T cells differentiated in the absence of CD152 signaling was determined in vivo. These novel insights extend our understanding of how immune responses of CD8(+) T cells are selectively modulated.",

        "Abstract": "Although T lymphocytes are constitutively nonadherent cells, they undergo facultative polarity during migration and upon interaction with cells presenting cognate antigen, suggesting that cell polarity might be critical for target cell destruction. Using two-photon imaging of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes, we found that CD44, a receptor for extracellular matrix proteins and glycosaminoglycans, was crucial for interstitial T cell navigation and, consequently, efficient tumor cell screening. CD44 functioned as a critical regulator of intratumoral movement by stabilizing cell polarity in migrating T cells, but not during target cell interactions. Stable anterior-posterior asymmetry was maintained by CD44 independently of its extracellular domain. Instead, migratory polarity depended on the recruitment of ezrin, radixin, moesin (ERM) proteins by the intracellular domain of CD44 to the posterior cellular protrusion. Our results formally demonstrate that CD44-dependent T lymphocyte locomotion within target sites represents an essential immunologic checkpoint that determines the potency of T cell effector functions.",

        "Abstract": "A na\u00efve T cell recruited into an immune response receives its critical inductive signals in the lymph node. The selected T cell must then produce cellular progeny empowered with new functions. Differentiated effector cells divide and migrate to infected tissues with an imprint of the instructions delivered to their progenitor. Some progeny of a selected na\u00efve T cell, however, must remain undifferentiated and persist as lymph node-dwelling memory cells to replace and fortify defense should the intruder return. The integration of cell division, differentiation, diversification, and four-dimensional navigation make the clonal burst of a T cell in reaction to microbial invasion an exciting problem of developmental biology, cellular adaptation to environmental cues, and the propagation of signaling pathways through space and time. Epigenetic control of gene expression and an ancient cellular diversification mechanism called asymmetric cell division have recently been proposed to explain how a selected T cell can accomplish its imposing tasks. Future investigations will be directed toward understanding the mechanisms that allow a selected T cell to produce daughter T cells that are different, that are capable of remembering their inductive history, and that fulfill the demand for acute function and regeneration.",

We show that CD8+ T cells deficient in the transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin (Eomes) fail to differentiate into functional killers required for defense against lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Instead, virus-specific CD8+ T cells lacking both T-bet and Eomes differentiate into an interleukin-17-secreting lineage, reminiscent of the helper T cell fate that has been implicated in autoimmunity and extracellular microbial defense. Upon viral infection, mice with T cells lacking both T-bet and Eomes develop a CD8+ T cell-dependent, progressive inflammatory and wasting syndrome characterized by multi-organ infiltration of neutrophils. T-bet and Eomes, thus, ensure that CD8+ T cells adopt an appropriate course of intracellular rather than extracellular destruction.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in two-photon microscopy have provided a new way of visualizing the behavior of fluorescently tagged cells within their natural microenvironment. This technology has allowed for generating a detailed picture of the cellular interaction dynamics operant in the activation of T cells and B cells during primary immune responses within secondary lymphoid organs. In contrast, relatively little is known about the migratory and interactive behavior of effector T cells within peripheral organs. We have recently developed a two-photon microscopy model that enables tracking of cytotoxic T cells within tumors. We have demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) follow random migratory paths and that their migratory properties depend on signals from the T-cell receptor. We further showed that TILs underwent short- and long-term interactions with tumor cells as well as macrophages. Recently, we succeeded in dynamic imaging of the distribution of fluorescently tagged molecules within TILs at subcellular resolution, which will be instrumental for defining the composition of the lytic synapse as well as the targeted release of cytotoxic granules by these cells. The purpose of this review is to put our findings into the context of the current literature and to point out the molecular cues mediating effector T-cell function as candidates for future investigation.",

        "Title": "Antagonistic nature of T helper 1/2 developmental programs in opposing peripheral induction of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.",
        "Abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the importance of peripheral induction of Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the dominant control of immunological tolerance. However, Foxp3(+) Treg differentiation from na\u00efve CD4(+) T cells occurs only under selective conditions, whereas the classical T helper (Th) 1 and 2 effector development often dominate T cell immune responses to antigen stimulation in the periphery. The reason for such disparity remains poorly understood. Here we report that Th1/Th2-polarizing cytokines can potently inhibit Foxp3(+) Treg differentiation from na\u00efve CD4(+) precursors induced by TGF-beta. Furthermore, antigen receptor-primed CD4(+) T cells are resistant to Treg induction because of autocrine production of IFNgamma and/or IL-4, whereas neutralizing IFNgamma and IL-4 not only can potentiate TGF-beta-mediated Foxp3 induction in vitro but can also enhance antigen-specific Foxp3(+) Treg differentiation in vivo. Mechanistically, inhibition of Foxp3(+) Treg development by Th1/Th2-polarizing cytokines involves the activation of Th1/Th2 lineage transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3 through the canonical Stat1-, Stat4-, and Stat6-dependent pathways. Using IFNgamma and IL-4 knockouts and retrovirus-mediated transduction of T-bet and GATA-3, we further demonstrate that enforced expression of the Th1/Th2 lineage-specific transcription factors is sufficient to block Foxp3 induction and Treg differentiation independent of the polarizing/effector cytokines. Thus, our study has unraveled a previously unrecognized mechanism of negative cross-regulation of Foxp3(+) Treg fate choice by Th1/Th2 lineage activities. In addition, these findings also provide an attainable explanation for the general paucity of antigen-triggered de novo generation of Foxp3(+) Tregs in the periphery.",

        "Abstract": "Immunity to intracellular pathogens requires dynamic balance between terminal differentiation of short-lived, cytotoxic effector CD8+ T cells and self-renewal of central-memory CD8+ T cells. We now show that T-bet represses transcription of IL-7Ralpha and drives differentiation of effector and effector-memory CD8+ T cells at the expense of central-memory cells. We also found T-bet to be overexpressed in CD8+ T cells that differentiated in the absence of CD4+ T cell help, a condition that is associated with defective central-memory formation. Finally, deletion of T-bet corrected the abnormal phenotypic and functional properties of \"unhelped\" memory CD8+ T cells. T-bet, thus, appears to function as a molecular switch between central- and effector-memory cell differentiation. Antagonism of T-bet may, therefore, represent a novel strategy to offset dysfunctional programming of memory CD8+ T cells.",

        "Abstract": "Autoimmunity is thought to reflect an imbalance between regulatory T helper lymphocytes (Treg) and pathogenic, IL-17-secreting T helper (Th17) cells. Induction of both adaptive Treg and Th17 cells requires signalling from TGF-beta. We now show that, in the context of TGF-beta signalling, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) leads to increased induction of CD4(+) T cells expressing the Treg specification factor forkhead box protein P3 (FoxP3) and decreased frequency of cells expressing IL-17, even in the presence of IL-6. Using a specific agonist and antagonist, as well as retroviral over-expression, we also provide evidence that the effects of ATRA are likely to be at least partially mediated by the nuclear retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARalpha). These findings indicate that signalling through a specific nuclear retinoic acid receptor can favour the decision to adopt the Treg fate at the expense of Th17 fate. Specific agonists of RARalpha could, therefore, be considered candidates for the treatment of autoimmunity.",

Owing to recent technological advances, some of the most imposing questions regarding effector and memory T cell differentiation are now becoming experimentally soluble: How many classes of antigen-specific T cells exist, and how malleable are they in their fate and in their functional state? How might a spectrum of cell fates be imparted to the clonal descendants of a single lymphocyte? Where, when, and how does pathogen-associated information refine the instruction, selection, and direction of newly activated T cells as they perform their tasks in different locations and times?

        "Abstract": "A hallmark of mammalian immunity is the heterogeneity of cell fate that exists among pathogen-experienced lymphocytes. We show that a dividing T lymphocyte initially responding to a microbe exhibits unequal partitioning of proteins that mediate signaling, cell fate specification, and asymmetric cell division. Asymmetric segregation of determinants appears to be coordinated by prolonged interaction between the T cell and its antigen-presenting cell before division. Additionally, the first two daughter T cells displayed phenotypic and functional indicators of being differentially fated toward effector and memory lineages. These results suggest a mechanism by which a single lymphocyte can apportion diverse cell fates necessary for adaptive immunity.",

        "Abstract": "Gammadelta T cells have unique features and functions compared with alphabeta T cells and have been proposed to bridge the innate and adaptive immune responses. Our earlier studies demonstrated that splenic gammadelta T cells predominantly produce IFN-gamma upon activation in vitro, which is partially due to the expression of the Th1-specific transcription factor T-bet. In this study we have explored the epigenetic and transcriptional programs that underlie default IFN-gamma production by gammadelta T cells. We show that the kinetics of IFN-gamma transcription is faster in gammadelta T cells compared with CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and that gammadelta T cells produce significantly greater amounts of IFN-gamma in a proliferation-independent manner when compared with other T cell subsets. By analyzing the methylation pattern of intron 1 of the ifn-gamma locus, we demonstrate that this region in naive gammadelta T cells is hypomethylated relative to the same element in naive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, naive gammadelta T cells constitutively express eomesodermin (Eomes), a transcription factor important for IFN-gamma production in CD8(+) T cells, and Eomes expression levels are enhanced upon activation. Retroviral transduction of activated gammadelta T cells from both wild-type and T-bet-deficient mice with a dominant negative form of Eomes significantly reduced IFN-gamma production, indicating a critical role for this transcription factor in mediating IFN-gamma production by gammadelta T cells in a T-bet-independent manner. Our results demonstrate that both epigenetic and transcriptional programs contribute to the early vigorous IFN-gamma production by gammadelta T cells.",

        "Abstract": "Most T cells belong to either of two lineages defined by the mutually exclusive expression of CD4 and CD8 coreceptors: CD4 T cells are major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II restricted and have helper function, whereas CD8 T cells are MHC I restricted and have cytotoxic function. The divergence between these two lineages occurs during intrathymic selection and is thought to be irreversible in mature T cells. It is, however, unclear whether the CD4-CD8 differentiation of postthymic T cells retains some level of plasticity or is stably maintained by mechanisms distinct from those that set lineage choice in the thymus. To address this issue, we examined if coreceptor or effector gene expression in mature CD8 T cells remains sensitive to the zinc finger transcription factor cKrox, which promotes CD4 and inhibits CD8 differentiation when expressed in thymocytes. We show that cKrox transduction into CD8 T cells inhibits their expression of CD8 and cytotoxic effector genes and impairs their cytotoxic activity, and that it promotes expression of helper-specific genes, although not of CD4 itself. These observations reveal a persistent degree of plasticity in CD4-CD8 differentiation in mature T cells.",

        "Abstract": "Cytokines are critical determinants for specification of lineage-defining transcription factors of CD4+ T cell subsets. Little is known, however, about how cytokines regulate expression of T-bet and eomesodermin (Eomes) in effector and memory CD8+ T cells. We now report that IL-12, a signature of cell-mediated immunity, represses Eomes while positively regulating T-bet in effector CD8+ T cells during infection with Listeria monocytogenes. After resolution of infection and abatement of IL-12 signaling, Eomes expression rises whereas T-bet expression declines in memory CD8+ T cells. Eomes becomes derepressed in effector cells by ablation of IL-12 signaling. In the absence of IL-12, the dynamics of clonal expansion and contraction are also perturbed. Together, these results reveal how a pathogen-associated signal, such as IL-12, could act as a switch, regulating appropriate clonal growth and decline while, in parallel, shaping a unique pattern of fate-determining transcription factors.",

In this study, we show that Eomes mRNA and protein are also expressed in developing Th1 cells, and exposure of naive Thp cells to IL-21 results in a decrease in Eomes expression. Moreover, the repression of Eomes expression by IL-21 is not due to an indirect effect of IL-21 on the expression of IFN-gamma or STAT4 and is independent of STAT1 and T-bet expression. Finally, we show that ectopic expression of Eomes prevents the inhibition of IFN-gamma production from IL-21-treated Thp cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Eomes plays a role in regulating IFN-gamma production in CD4+ T cells and IL-21 inhibits IFN-gamma production in developing Th1 cells through the repression of Eomes expression.",

        "Abstract": "The Tec family tyrosine kinases, Itk and Rlk, are expressed in thymocytes and peripheral T cells and regulate thresholds of T cell receptor signaling. Yet little is known about the specific role of Itk- and Rlk-dependent signals in CD8(+) T cell maturation. We show here that Itk(-/-) and Rlk(-/-)Itk(-/-) mice were nearly devoid of conventional CD8(+) T cells and, instead, contained a large population of CD8(+) T cells that bear striking similarity to lineages of innate lymphocytes. Itk(-/-) and Rlk(-/-)Itk(-/-) CD8(+) thymocytes and T cells were CD44(hi), CD122(+), and NK1.1(+); were able to produce interferon-gamma directly ex vivo; and were dependent on interleukin-15. Itk(-/-) and Rlk(-/-)Itk(-/-) CD8(+) thymocytes expressed abundant transcripts for the T box transcription factor, eomesodermin, correlating with their phenotype and function. These data indicate a critical role for Itk and Rlk in conventional CD8(+) T cell development in the thymus.",

        "Abstract": "We are often taught that secondary, or memory, responses by lymphocytes are more vigorous than primary responses. An expectation commonly associated with this notion is that the initial encounter with a pathogen should result in immunity to re-infection. Although this outcome is sometimes the case, it is not universally true. In this review, we propose a unified model of T-cell memory to explain the apparent successes and failures of eliciting vaccine-like protection from prior encounters with pathogens. We speculate that memory T cells arise as an invariant consequence of clonal selection during an immune response. The quality of memory T cells, however, seems to vary in the degree to which they have acquired effector characteristics and, thus, their ability to confer immunity to re-infection. Although not all memory T cells possess the embellished attributes of fully developed effector cells, they all seem to share the rudimentary quality of preserving an antigen specificity that has proven itself useful. We suggest that the ability to maintain the integrity of the T-cell repertoire, more than establishing immunity to re-infection, may represent the fundamental form of memory for the adaptive immune system.",

        "Abstract": "One mechanism to control immune responses following infection is to rapidly down-regulate Ag presentation, which has been observed in acute viral and bacterial infections. In this study, we describe experiments designed to address whether Ag presentation is decreased after an initial response to Leishmania major. Naive alphabeta-Leishmania-specific (ABLE) TCR transgenic T cells were adoptively transferred into mice at various times after L. major infection to determine the duration of presentation of parasite-derived Ags. ABLE T cells responded vigorously at the initiation of infection, but the ability to prime these cells quickly diminished, independent of IL-10, regulatory T cells, or Ag load. However, Ag-experienced clonal and polyclonal T cell populations could respond, indicating that the diminution in naive ABLE cell responses was not due to lack of Ag presentation. Because naive T cell priming could be restored by removal of the endogenous T cell population, or adoptive transfer of Ag-pulsed dendritic cells, it appears that T cells that have previously encountered Ag during infection compete with naive Ag-specific T cells. These results suggest that during L. major infection Ag-experienced T cells, rather than naive T cells, may be primarily responsible for sustaining the immune response.",

        "Abstract": "When Th1 effector CD4 cells encounter tolerizing Ag in vivo, their capacity to express the effector cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha is lost more rapidly than noneffector functions such as IL-2 production and proliferation. To localize the relevant intracellular signaling defects, cytokine expression was compared following restimulation with Ag vs agents that bypass TCR-proximal signaling. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha expression were both partially rescued when TCR-proximal signaling was bypassed, indicating that both TCR-proximal and -distal signaling defects impair the expression of these two effector cytokines. In contrast, bypassing TCR-proximal signaling fully rescued IL-2 expression. T-bet, a transcription and chromatin remodeling factor that is required to direct the differentiation of naive CD4 cells into IFN-gamma-expressing Th1 effectors, was partially down-modulated in tolerized Th1 effectors. Enforcing T-bet expression during tolerization selectively rescued the ability to express IFN-gamma, but not TNF-alpha. Conversely, expression of a dominant-negative T-bet in Th1 effectors selectively impaired the ability to express IFN-gamma, but not TNF-alpha. Analysis of histone acetylation at the IFN-gamma promoter further suggested that down-modulation of T-bet expression during Th1 effector CD4 cell tolerization does not impair IFN-gamma expression potential through alterations in chromatin structure.",

Memory CD8(+) T cells and natural killer cells share cytotoxic potential and dependence on the growth factor interleukin 15. We now show that mice with compound mutations of the genes encoding the transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin were nearly devoid of several lineages dependent on interleukin 15, including memory CD8(+) T cells and mature natural killer cells, and that their cells had defective cytotoxic effector programming. Moreover, T-bet and eomesodermin were responsible for inducing enhanced expression of CD122, the receptor specifying interleukin 15 responsiveness. Therefore, these key transcription factors link the long-term renewal of memory CD8(+) T cells to their characteristic effector potency.",

        "Abstract": "The stability of helper T cell fates is not well understood. Using conditional introduction of dominant-negative factors, we now show that T-bet and GATA-3 are far more critical in establishment than maintenance of IFN-gamma and IL-4 activity during Th1 and Th2 maturation, respectively. We also show that a genetic interaction between T-bet and its target Hlx seems to be required for Th1 maturation, but that Hlx may also be dispensable for maintenance of a transcriptionally permissive ifng gene. In parallel to progressive activator independence in the permissive lineage, the ifng gene becomes more recalcitrant to switching as the forbidden lineage matures. T-bet plus Hlx can disrupt ifng silencing when introduced into developing Th2 cells, but they fail to perturb ifng silencing in mature Th2 cells. In contrast, a hypermorphic allele of T-bet can reverse silencing of the ifng gene in mature Th2 cells. These results suggest that signature gene activity of helper T cells is initially plastic but later becomes epigenetically fixed and offer an initial strategy for inducing mature cells to switch their fate.",

        "Abstract": "Immunity often depends on proper cell fate choice by helper T lymphocytes. A naive cell, with minimal expression of IFN-gamma and IL-4, must give rise to progeny expressing high levels of either one, but not both, of those cytokines to defend against protozoan and helminthic pathogens, respectively. In the present study, we show that inactivation of the Mbd2 gene, which links DNA methylation and repressed chromatin, results in enhanced resistance to the protozoan parasite Leishmania major but impaired immunity to the intestinal helminth Trichuris muris. Helper T cells from methyl CpG-binding domain protein-2-deficient mice exhibit exuberant patterns of cytokine expression despite appropriate silencing of genes encoding the lineage-specifying factors T-bet and GATA-3. These results suggest that gene silencing can facilitate the ability of a progenitor cell to give rise to appropriately differentiated daughter cells in vivo. These findings also point to novel pathways that could participate in genetic control of resistance to infection and autoimmunity.",

        "Abstract": "Helper T cells engaged in an immune response confront a prevalent challenge for developmentally regulated gene expression: How does a cell give rise to daughter cells with different fates? Additionally, lymphocyte function is intimately associated with the processes of cell division and migration. This imposes an additional burden for daughter cells, to remember inductive events from which they are temporally and spatially removed. An emerging view is that helper T cells use epigenetic mechanisms tied to the structure of chromatin and its covalent modifications to achieve at least two important features of their programmed gene expression. Epigenetic effects organize the ability of signal transduction pathways to generate a restricted set of progeny from a multi-potent progenitor. In addition, epigenetic effects seem to allow dividing cells to memorize, or imprint, signaling events that occurred earlier in their development. Beyond helper T cells, the use of epigenetic effects is emerging as a common strategy in development and function of the mammalian immune system, suggesting that epigenetic effects may play a more prominent role in metazoan cell differentiation than previously appreciated. Lymphocytes are, thus, becoming a tractable system for genetic and biochemical dissection of the ways in which the genome is embedded with regulatory information to achieve developmental complexity.",

        "Abstract": "To address how heritable patterns of gene expression are acquired during the differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells, we analyzed the nuclear position of lineage-restricted cytokine genes and their upstream regulators by 3-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization. During Th1 differentiation, GATA-3 and c-maf loci, which encode upstream regulators of Th2 cytokines, were progressively repositioned to centromeric heterochromatin as defined by a gamma-satellite repeat probe and/or the nuclear periphery, compartments that have been associated with transcriptional repression. A third transcription factor locus, T-bet, which controls Th1-specific programs, was subject to de novo CpG methylation in a Th2 cell clone. In contrast, we did not find repositioning of the cytokine gene loci IL-2, IL-3, IL-4 or IFN-gamma during T helper cell differentiation. Instead, IFN-gamma was constitutively associated with the nuclear periphery, even when primed for expression in Th1 cells. Our results suggest that Th1/Th2 lineage commitment and differentiation involve repositioning of the regulators of cytokine expression, rather than the cytokine genes themselves.",

        "Abstract": "MHC class I-specific Ly49 inhibitory receptors regulate NK cell activation, thereby preventing autologous damage to normal cells. Ly49 receptors are also expressed on a subset of CD8+ T cells whose origin and function remain unknown. We report here that, despite their phenotypic and cytolytic similarities, Ly49+CD8+ T cells and conventional Ly49-CD44high memory-phenotype CD8+ T cells present strikingly distinct features. First, under steady state conditions Ly49+CD8+ T cells are poor cytokine producers (TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) upon TCR triggering. Second, Ly49+CD8+ T cells are not induced upon various settings of Ag immunization or microbial challenge. However, Ly49 can be induced on a fraction of self-specific CD8+ T cells if CD4+ T cells are present. Finally, the size of the Ly49+CD8+ T cell subset is selectively reduced in the absence of STAT1. These results indicate that Ly49 expression is associated with a differentiation program of cytolytic CD8+ T cells triggered upon chronic antigenic exposure. They further suggest that the size of the Ly49+CD8+ T cell subset marks a history of CD8+ T cell activation that might preferentially result from endogenous inducers of inflammation rather than from microbial infections.",

        "Abstract": "The ability of NK and T cells to produce IFN-gamma is critical for resistance to numerous intracellular pathogens but the kinetics of these responses differ. Consistent with this is a requirement for naive T cells to become activated and undergo proliferation-dependent epigenetic changes to the IFN-gamma locus that allow them to produce IFN-gamma. The data presented here reveal that unlike T cells, murine NK cells produce IFN-gamma under conditions of short-term cytokine stimulation, and these events are independent of proliferation and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, analysis of the IFN-gamma locus in NK cells reveals that this locus is constitutively demethylated. The finding that NK cells do not need to remodel the IFN-gamma locus to produce IFN-gamma, either because they do not exhibit epigenetic repression or they have undergone prior remodeling during development, provides a molecular basis for the innate and adaptive regulation of the production of this cytokine.",

        "Abstract": "The production of IFN-gamma by T cells and the ability of this cytokine to activate the transcription factor STAT1 are implicated in the activation of antimicrobial mechanisms required for resistance to intracellular pathogens. In addition, recent studies have suggested that the ability of STAT1 to inhibit the activation of STAT4 prevents the development of Th1 responses. However, other studies suggest that STAT1 is required to enhance the expression of T-bet, a transcription factor that promotes Th1 responses. To address the role of STAT1 in resistance to T. gondii, Stat1-/- mice were infected with this pathogen, and their response to infection was assessed. Although Stat1-/- mice produced normal serum levels of IL-12 and IFN-gamma, these mice were unable to control parasite replication and rapidly succumbed to this infection. Susceptibility to toxoplasmosis was associated with an inability to up-regulate MHC expression on macrophages, defects in NO production, and the inability to up-regulate some of the IFN-inducible GTPase family of proteins, molecules associated with antitoxoplasma activity. Analysis of T cell responses revealed that STAT1 was not required for the development of a Th1 response, but was required for the infection-induced up-regulation of T-bet. Together these studies suggest that during toxoplasmosis the major role of STAT1 is not in the development of protective T cell responses, but, rather, STAT1 is important in the development of antimicrobial effector mechanisms.",

It is not clear if a key regulatory transcription factor unites the effector functions of CD8+ T cells. We now show that Eomesodermin (Eomes), a paralogue of T-bet, is induced in effector CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic expression of Eomes was sufficient to invoke attributes of effector CD8+ T cells, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), perforin, and granzyme B. Loss-of-function analysis suggests Eomes may also be necessary for full effector differentiation of CD8+ T cells. We suggest that Eomesodermin is likely to complement the actions of T-bet and act as a key regulatory gene in the development of cell-mediated immunity.",

Mature Th1 and Th2 cell subsets are thought to arise from a common naive progenitor. In these precursor cells, effector cytokine genes appear to exist in a restrictive structure, which is determined by methylation of cytosine bases and higher-order structure of chromatin. The restrictive gene structures appear to be plastic, giving way to more active structures in some daughter cells. Some genetic loci, which are active in naive cells, however, become silenced during terminal differentiation. Both the derepression of silent loci and the silencing of active loci appear to be linked to the process of DNA replication. Future investigation will be directed toward understanding the way in which patterns of gene expression are altered or transmitted during the cell division of helper T lymphocytes.",

We examined cells lacking methyl CpG binding domain protein-2 (MBD2), a molecule that has been proposed to link DNA methylation to silent chromatin. Helper T cells from Mbd2(-/-) mice exhibit disordered differentiation. IL-4, the signature of a restricted set of progeny, is expressed ectopically in Mbd2(-/-) parent and daughter cells. Loss of MBD2-mediated silencing renders the normally essential activator, Gata-3, dispensable for IL-4 induction. Gata-3 and MBD2 act in competition, wherein each factor independently, and quantitatively, regulates the binary choice of whether heritable IL-4 expression is established. Gata-3 functions, in part, to displace MBD2 from methylated DNA. These results suggest that activating and silencing signals integrate to provide spatially and temporally restricted patterns of gene activity.",

        "Title": "Hlx is induced by and genetically interacts with T-bet to promote heritable T(H)1 gene induction.",
        "Abstract": "Type 1 helper T (T(H)1) cells are essential for cellular immunity, but their ontogeny, maturation and durability remain poorly understood. By constructing a dominant-negative form of T-bet, we were able to determine the role played by this lineage-inducing trans-activator in the establishment and maintenance of heritable T(H)1 gene expression. Optimal induction of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression required genetic interaction between T-bet and its target, the homeoprotein Hlx. In fully mature T(H)1 cells, reiteration of IFN-gamma expression and stable chromatin remodeling became relatively independent of T-bet activity and coincided with demethylation of DNA. In contrast, some lineage attributes, such as expression of IL-12R beta 2 (interleukin 12 receptor beta 2), required ongoing T-bet activity in mature T(H)1 cells and their progeny. These findings suggest that heritable states of gene expression might be maintained by continued expression of the inducing factor or by a mechanism that confers a stable imprint of the induced state.",
