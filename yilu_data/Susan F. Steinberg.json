        "Abstract": "Protein kinase C-\u03b1 (PKC\u03b1) plays a major role in a diverse range of cellular processes. Studies to date have defined the regulatory controls and function of PKC\u03b1 entirely based upon the previously annotated ubiquitously expressed prototypical isoform. From RNA-seq-based transcriptome analysis in murine heart, we identified a previously unannotated PKC\u03b1 variant produced by alternative RNA splicing. This PKC\u03b1 transcript variant, which we named PKC\u03b1-novel exon (PKC\u03b1-NE), contains an extra exon between exon 16 and exon 17, and is specifically detected in adult mouse cardiac and skeletal muscle, but not other tissues; it is also detected in human hearts. This transcript variant yields a PKC\u03b1 isoform with additional 16 amino acids inserted in its COOH-terminal variable region. Although the canonical PKC\u03b1 enzyme is a lipid-dependent kinase, in vitro kinase assays show that PKC\u03b1-NE displays a high level of basal lipid-independent catalytic activity. Our unbiased proteomic analysis identified a specific interaction between PKC\u03b1-NE and eukaryotic elongation factor-1\u03b1 (eEF1A1). Studies in cardiomyocytes link PKC\u03b1-NE expression to an increase in eEF1A1 phosphorylation and elevated protein synthesis. In summary, we have identified a previously uncharacterized muscle-specific PKC\u03b1 splicing variant, PKC\u03b1-NE, with distinct biochemical properties that plays a unique role in the control of the protein synthesis machinery in cardiomyocytes.",

        "Abstract": "\u03b2 1 -adrenergic receptors (\u03b2 1 ARs) are the principle mediators of catecholamine actions in cardiomyocytes. \u03b2 1 ARs rapidly adjust cardiac output and provide short-term hemodynamic support for the failing heart by activating a Gs-adenylyl cyclase pathway that increases 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and leads to the activation of protein kinase A and the phosphorylation of substrates involved in excitation-contraction coupling. However, chronic persistent \u03b2 1 AR activation in the setting of heart failure leads to a spectrum of maladaptive changes that contribute to the evolution of heart failure. The molecular basis for \u03b2 1 AR-driven maladaptive responses remains uncertain because chronic persistent \u03b2 1 AR activation has been linked to the activation of both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic signaling pathways. Of note, studies to date have been predicated on the assumption that \u03b2 1 ARs signal exclusively as full-length receptor proteins. Our recent studies show that \u03b2 1 ARs are detected as both full-length and N-terminally truncated species in cardiomyocytes, that N-terminal cleavage is regulated by O-glycan modifications at specific sites on the \u03b2 1 AR N-terminus, and that N-terminally truncated \u03b2 1 ARs remain signaling competent, but their signaling properties differ from those of the full-length \u03b2 1 AR. The N-terminally truncated form of the \u03b2 1 AR constitutively activates the protein kinase B signaling pathway and confers protection against doxorubicin-dependent apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. These studies identify a novel signaling paradigm for the \u03b2 1 AR, implicating the N-terminus as a heretofore-unrecognized structural determinant of \u03b2 1 AR responsiveness that could be pharmacologically targeted for therapeutic advantage.",

        "Abstract": "Protein kinases are a superfamily of enzymes that control a wide range of cellular functions. These enzymes share a highly conserved catalytic core that folds into a similar bilobar three-dimensional structure. One highly conserved region in the protein kinase core is the glycine-rich loop (or G-loop), a highly flexible loop that is characterized by a consensus GxGxxG sequence. The G-loop points toward the catalytic cleft and functions to bind and position ATP for phosphotransfer. Of note, in many protein kinases, the second and third glycine residues in the G-loop triad flank residues that can be targets for phosphorylation (Ser, Thr, or Tyr) or other post-translational modifications (ubiquitination, acetylation, O-GlcNAcylation, oxidation). There is considerable evidence that cyclin-dependent kinases are held inactive through inhibitory phosphorylation of the conserved Thr/Tyr residues in this position of the G-loop and that dephosphorylation by cellular phosphatases is required for CDK activation and progression through the cell cycle. This review summarizes literature that identifies residues in or adjacent to the G-loop in other protein kinases that are targets for functionally important post-translational modifications.",

        "Abstract": "Protein kinase D (PKD) consists of a family of three structurally related enzymes that are co-expressed in the heart and have important roles in many biological responses. PKD1 is activated by pro-hypertrophic stimuli and has been implicated in adverse cardiac remodeling. Efforts to define the cardiac actions of PKD2 and PKD3 have been less successful at least in part because conventional methods provide a general screen for PKD activation but are poorly suited to resolve activation patterns for PKD2 or PKD3. This study uses Phos-tag SDS-PAGE, a method that exaggerates phosphorylation-dependent mobility shifts, to overcome this technical limitation. Phos-tag SDS-PAGE resolves PKD1 as distinct molecular species (indicative of pools of enzyme with distinct phosphorylation profiles) in unstimulated cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes; as a result, attempts to track PKD1 mobility shifts that result from agonist activation were only moderately successful. In contrast, PKD2 and PKD3 are recovered from resting cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes as single molecular species; both enzymes display robust mobility shifts in Phos-tag SDS-PAGE in response to treatment with sphingosine-1-phosphate, thrombin, PDGF, or H",

Factors that tip the balance of protein phosphorylation lead to changes in a wide range of cellular responses, including cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. The protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine kinases sits at nodal points in many signal transduction pathways; PKC enzymes have been the focus of considerable attention since they contribute to both normal physiological responses as well as maladaptive pathological responses that drive a wide range of clinical disorders. This review provides a background on the mechanisms that regulate individual PKC isoenzymes followed by a discussion of recent insights into their role in the pathogenesis of diseases such as cancer. We then provide an overview on the role of individual PKC isoenzymes in the regulation of cardiac contractility and pathophysiological growth responses, with a focus on the PKC-dependent mechanisms that regulate pump function and/or contribute to the pathogenesis of heart failure.",

        "Abstract": "Protein kinase C-\u03b4 (PKC\u03b4) is a signalling kinase that regulates many cellular responses. Although most studies focus on allosteric mechanisms that activate PKC\u03b4 at membranes, PKC\u03b4 also is controlled via multi-site phosphorylation [Gong et al. (2015) Mol. Cell. Biol. 35: , 1727-1740]. The present study uses MS-based methods to identify PKC\u03b4 phosphorylation at Thr(50) and Ser(645) (in resting and PMA-treated cardiomyocytes) as well as Thr(37), Thr(38), Ser(130), Thr(164), Thr(211), Thr(215), Ser(218), Thr(295), Ser(299) and Thr(656) (as sites that increase with PMA). We focused on the consequences of phosphorylation at Ser(130) and Thr(141) (sites just N-terminal to the pseudosubstrate domain). We show that S130D and T141E substitutions co-operate to increase PKC\u03b4's basal lipid-independent activity and that Ser(130)/Thr(141) di-phosphorylation influences PKC\u03b4's substrate specificity. We recently reported that PKC\u03b4 preferentially phosphorylates substrates with a phosphoacceptor serine residue and that this is due to constitutive phosphorylation at Ser(357), an ATP-positioning G-loop site that limits PKC\u03b4's threonine kinase activity [Gong et al. (2015) Mol. Cell. Biol. 35: , 1727-1740]. The present study shows that S130D and T141E substitutions increase PKC\u03b4's threonine kinase activity indirectly by decreasing G loop phosphorylation at Ser(357). A S130F substitution [that mimics a S130F single-nt polymorphism (SNP) identified in some human populations] also increases PKC\u03b4's maximal lipid-dependent catalytic activity and confers threonine kinase activity. Finally, we show that Ser(130)/Thr(141) phosphorylations relieve auto-inhibitory constraints that limit PKC\u03b4's activity and substrate specificity in a cell-based context. Since phosphorylation sites map to similar positions relative to the pseudosubstrate domains of other PKCs, our results suggest that phosphorylation in this region of the enzyme may constitute a general mechanism to control PKC isoform activity.",

        "Title": "Mechanisms for redox-regulation of protein kinase C.",
        "Abstract": "Protein kinase C (PKC) is comprised of a family of signal-regulated enzymes that play pleiotropic roles in the control of many physiological and pathological responses. PKC isoforms are traditionally viewed as allosterically activated enzymes that are recruited to membranes by growth factor receptor-generated lipid cofactors. An inherent assumption of this conventional model of PKC isoform activation is that PKCs act exclusively at membrane-delimited substrates and that PKC catalytic activity is an inherent property of each enzyme that is not altered by the activation process. This traditional model of PKC activation does not adequately explain the many well-documented actions of PKC enzymes in mitochondrial, nuclear, and cardiac sarcomeric (non-sarcolemmal) subcellular compartments. Recent studies address this dilemma by identifying stimulus-specific differences in the mechanisms for PKC isoform activation during growth factor activation versus oxidative stress. This review discusses a number of non-canonical redox-triggered mechanisms that can alter the catalytic properties and subcellular compartmentation patterns of PKC enzymes. While some redox-activated mechanisms act at structural determinants that are common to all PKCs, the redox-dependent mechanism for PKC\u03b4 activation requires Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of a unique phosphorylation motif on this enzyme and is isoform specific. Since oxidative stress contributes to pathogenesis of a wide range of clinical disorders, these stimulus-specific differences in the controls and consequences of PKC activation have important implications for the design and evaluation of PKC-targeted therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "The diverse roles of protein kinase C-\u03b4 (PKC\u03b4) in cellular growth, survival, and injury have been attributed to stimulus-specific differences in PKC\u03b4 signaling responses. PKC\u03b4 exerts membrane-delimited actions in cells activated by agonists that stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis. PKC\u03b4 is released from membranes as a Tyr(313)-phosphorylated enzyme that displays a high level of lipid-independent activity and altered substrate specificity during oxidative stress. This study identifies an interaction between PKC\u03b4's Tyr(313)-phosphorylated hinge region and its phosphotyrosine-binding C2 domain that controls PKC\u03b4's enzymology indirectly by decreasing phosphorylation in the kinase domain ATP-positioning loop at Ser(359). We show that wild-type (WT) PKC\u03b4 displays a strong preference for substrates with serine as the phosphoacceptor residue at the active site when it harbors phosphomimetic or bulky substitutions at Ser(359.) In contrast, PKC\u03b4-S359A displays lipid-independent activity toward substrates with either a serine or threonine as the phosphoacceptor residue. Additional studies in cardiomyocytes show that oxidative stress decreases Ser(359) phosphorylation on native PKC\u03b4 and that PKC\u03b4-S359A overexpression increases basal levels of phosphorylation on substrates with both phosphoacceptor site serine and threonine residues. Collectively, these studies identify a C2 domain-pTyr(313) docking interaction that controls ATP-positioning loop phosphorylation as a novel, dynamically regulated, and physiologically relevant structural determinant of PKC\u03b4 catalytic activity.",

        "Title": "The protein kinase D1 COOH terminus: marker or regulator of enzyme activity?",
        "Abstract": "Protein kinase D1 (PKD1) is a Ser/Thr kinase implicated in a wide variety of cellular responses. PKD1 activation is generally attributed to a PKC-dependent pathway that leads to phosphorylation of the activation loop at Ser(744)/Ser(748). This modification increases catalytic activity, including that toward an autophosphorylation site (Ser(916)) in a postsynaptic density-95/disks large/zonula occludens-1 (PDZ)-binding motif at the extreme COOH terminus. However, there is growing evidence that PKD1 activation can also result from a PKC-independent autocatalytic reaction at Ser(744)/Ser(748) and that certain stimuli increase in PKD1 phosphorylation at Ser(744)/S(748) without an increase in autophosphorylation at Ser(916). This study exposes a mechanism that results in a discrepancy between PKD1 COOH-terminal autocatalytic activity and activity toward other substrates. We show that PKD1 constructs harboring COOH-terminal epitope tags display high levels of in vitro activation loop autocatalytic activity and activity toward syntide-2 (a peptide substrate), but no Ser(916) autocatalytic activity. Cell-based studies show that the COOH-terminal tag, adjacent to PKD1's PDZ1-binding motif, does not grossly influence PKD1 partitioning between soluble and particulate fractions in resting cells or PKD1 translocation to the particulate fraction following treatment with PMA. However, a COOH-terminal tag that confers a high level of activation loop autocatalytic activity decreases the PKC requirement for agonist-dependent PKD1 activation in cells. The recognition that COOH-terminal tags alter PKD1's pharmacological profile is important from a technical standpoint. The altered dynamics and activation mechanisms for COOH-terminal-tagged PKD1 enzymes also could model the signaling properties of localized pools of enzyme anchored through the COOH terminus to PDZ domain-containing scaffolding proteins.",

        "Title": "S49G and R389G polymorphisms of the \u03b2\u2081-adrenergic receptor influence signaling via the cAMP-PKA and ERK pathways.",
        "Abstract": "Two functionally important \u03b21-adrenergic receptor (\u03b21AR) polymorphisms have been identified. The R389G polymorphism influences coupling to the Gs-cAMP pathway. R(389)-\u03b21ARs display enhanced activation of cAMP/PKA; they provide short-term inotropic support but also cause a predisposition to cardiomyopathic decompensation. A second S49G polymorphism is implicated in the evolution of heart failure, but the mechanism remains uncertain. This study shows that position 49 and 389 polymorphisms function in a coordinate manner to influence agonist-dependent cAMP/PKA and ERK responses. cAMP/PKA and ERK responses are more robust in HEK293 cells that heterologously overexpress G(49)-\u03b21ARs, compared with S(49)-\u03b21ARs. However, this phenotype is most obvious on a G(389)-\u03b21AR background; the more robust agonist-dependent cAMP/PKA and ERK responses in R(389)-\u03b21AR cells effectively obscure the effect of the S49G polymorphism. We also show that isoproterenol (Iso) and carvedilol activate ERK via a similar EGFR-independent mechanism in cells expressing various \u03b21AR haplotypes. However, Iso activates ERK via an Src-independent pathway, but carvedilol-dependent ERK activation requires Src. Since the S49G polymorphism has been linked to changes in \u03b21AR trafficking, we examined whether \u03b21AR polymorphisms influence partitioning to lipid raft membranes. Biochemical fractionation studies show that all four \u03b21AR variants are recovered in buoyant flotillin-enriched membranes; the distinct signaling phenotypes of the different \u03b21AR variants could not be attributed to any gross differences in basal compartmentalization to lipid raft membranes. The allele-specific differences in \u03b21AR signaling phenotypes identified in this study could underlie interindividual differences in responsiveness to \u03b2-blocker therapy and clinical outcome in heart failure.",

Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) can activate signaling pathways that contribute to ischemic preconditioning and cardioprotection, high levels of ROS induce structural modifications of the sarcomere that impact on pump function and the pathogenesis of heart failure. However, the precise nature of the redox-dependent change in contractility is determined by the source/identity of the oxidant species, the level of oxidative stress, and the chemistry/position of oxidant-induced posttranslational modifications on individual proteins within the sarcomere. This review focuses on various ROS-induced posttranslational modifications of myofilament proteins (including direct oxidative modifications of myofilament proteins, myofilament protein phosphorylation by ROS-activated signaling enzymes, and myofilament protein cleavage by ROS-activated proteases) that have been implicated in the control of cardiac contractility.",

        "Title": "Regulatory domain determinants that control PKD1 activity.",
        "Abstract": "The canonical pathway for protein kinase D1 (PKD1) activation by growth factor receptors involves diacylglycerol binding to the C1 domain and protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation at the activation loop. PKD1 then autophosphorylates at Ser(916), a modification frequently used as a surrogate marker of PKD1 activity. PKD1 also is cleaved by caspase-3 at a site in the C1-PH interdomain during apoptosis; the functional consequences of this cleavage event remain uncertain. This study shows that PKD1-\u03941-321 (an N-terminal deletion mutant lacking the C1 domain and flanking sequence that models the catalytic fragment that accumulates during apoptosis) and PKD1-CD (the isolated catalytic domain) display high basal Ser(916) autocatalytic activity and robust activity toward CREBtide (a peptide substrate) but little to no activation loop autophosphorylation and no associated activity toward protein substrates, such as cAMP-response element binding protein and cardiac troponin I. In contrast, PKD1-\u0394PH (a PH domain deletion mutant) is recovered as a constitutively active enzyme, with high basal autocatalytic activity and high basal activity toward peptide and protein substrates. These results indicate that individual regions in the regulatory domain act in a distinct manner to control PKD1 activity. Finally, cell-based studies show that PKD1-\u03941-321 does not substitute for WT-PKD1 as an in vivo activator of cAMP-response element binding protein and ERK phosphorylation. Proteolytic events that remove the C1 domain (but not the autoinhibitory PH domain) limit maximal PKD1 activity toward physiologically relevant protein substrates and lead to a defect in PKD1-dependent cellular responses.",

        "Abstract": "Protein kinase D1 (PKD1) is a stress-activated serine/threonine kinase that plays a vital role in various physiologically important biological processes, including cell growth, apoptosis, adhesion, motility, and angiogenesis. Dysregulated PKD1 expression also contributes to the pathogenesis of certain cancers and cardiovascular disorders. Studies to date have focused primarily on the canonical membrane-delimited pathway for PKD1 activation by G protein-coupled receptors or peptide growth factors. Here, agonist-dependent increases in diacylglycerol accumulation lead to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and PKC-dependent phosphorylation of PKD1 at two highly conserved serine residues in the activation loop; this modification increases PKD1 catalytic activity, as assessed by PKD1 autophosphorylation at a consensus phosphorylation motif at the extreme C terminus. However, recent studies expose additional controls and consequences for PKD1 activation loop and C-terminal phosphorylation as well as additional autophosphorylation reactions and trans-phosphorylations (by PKC and other cellular enzymes) that contribute to the spatiotemporal control of PKD1 signaling in cells. This review focuses on the multisite phosphorylations that are known or predicted to influence PKD1 catalytic activity and may also influence docking interactions with cellular scaffolds and trafficking to signaling microdomains in various subcellular compartments. These modifications represent novel targets for the development of PKD1-directed pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancers and cardiovascular disorders.",

        "Title": "Protein kinase D isoforms are activated in an agonist-specific manner in cardiomyocytes.",
        "Abstract": "Protein kinase D (PKD) exists as a family of structurally related enzymes that are activated through similar phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms involving protein kinase C (PKC). While individual PKD isoforms could in theory mediate distinct biological functions, previous studies identify a high level of functional redundancy for PKD1 and PKD2 in various cellular contexts. This study shows that PKD1 and PKD2 are activated in a stimulus-specific manner in neonatal cardiomyocytes. The \u03b1(1)-adrenergic receptor agonist norepinephrine selectively activates PKD1, thrombin and PDGF selectively activate PKD2, and endothelin-1 and PMA activate both PKD1 and PKD2. PKC activity is implicated in the \u03b1(1)-adrenergic receptor pathway that activates PKD1 and the thrombin- and PDGF-dependent pathways that activate PKD2. Endothelin-1 activates PKD via both rapid PKC-dependent and more sustained PKC-independent mechanisms. The functional consequences of PKD activation were assessed by tracking phosphorylation of CREB and cardiac troponin I (cTnI), two physiologically relevant PKD substrates in cardiomyocytes. We show that overexpression of an activated PKD1-S744E/S748E transgene increases CREB-Ser(133) and cTnI-Ser(23)/Ser(24) phosphorylation, but agonist-dependent pathways that activate native PKD1 or PKD2 selectively increase CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation; there is no associated increase in cTnI-Ser(23)/Ser(24) phosphorylation. Gene silencing studies provide unanticipated evidence that PKD1 down-regulation leads to a compensatory increase in PKD2 activity and that down-regulation of PKD1 (alone or in combination with PKD2) leads to an increase in CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation. Collectively, these studies identify distinct roles for native PKD1 and PKD2 enzymes in stress-dependent pathways that influence cardiac remodeling and the progression of heart failure.",

        "Title": "Cardiomyocyte lipids impair \u03b2-adrenergic receptor function via PKC activation.",
        "Abstract": "Normal hearts have increased contractility in response to catecholamines. Because several lipids activate PKCs, we hypothesized that excess cellular lipids would inhibit cardiomyocyte responsiveness to adrenergic stimuli. Cardiomyocytes treated with saturated free fatty acids, ceramide, and diacylglycerol had reduced cellular cAMP response to isoproterenol. This was associated with increased PKC activation and reduction of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) density. Pharmacological and genetic PKC inhibition prevented both palmitate-induced \u03b2-AR insensitivity and the accompanying reduction in cell surface \u03b2-ARs. Mice with excess lipid uptake due to either cardiac-specific overexpression of anchored lipoprotein lipase, PPAR\u03b3, or acyl-CoA synthetase-1 or high-fat diet showed reduced inotropic responsiveness to dobutamine. This was associated with activation of protein kinase C (PKC)\u03b1 or PKC\u03b4. Thus, several lipids that are increased in the setting of lipotoxicity can produce abnormalities in \u03b2-AR responsiveness. This can be attributed to PKC activation and reduced \u03b2-AR levels.",

        "Title": "Protein kinase C-{delta} regulates the subcellular localization of Shc in H2O2-treated cardiomyocytes.",
        "Abstract": "Protein kinase C-\u03b4 (PKC\u03b4) exerts important cardiac actions as a lipid-regulated kinase. There is limited evidence that PKC\u03b4 also might exert an additional kinase-independent action as a regulator of the subcellular compartmentalization of binding partners such as Shc (Src homologous and collagen), a family of adapter proteins that play key roles in growth regulation and oxidative stress responses. This study shows that native PKC\u03b4 forms complexes with endogenous Shc proteins in H(2)O(2)-treated cardiomyocytes; H(2)O(2) treatment also leads to the accumulation of PKC\u03b4 and Shc in a detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction and in mitochondria. H(2)O(2)-dependent recruitment of Shc isoforms to cytoskeletal and mitochondrial fractions is amplified by wild-type-PKC\u03b4 overexpression, consistent with the notion that PKC\u03b4 acts as a signal-regulated scaffold to anchor Shc in specific subcellular compartments. However, overexpression studies with kinase-dead (KD)-PKC\u03b4-K376R (an ATP-binding mutant of PKC\u03b4 that lacks catalytic activity) are less informative, since KD-PKC\u03b4-K376R aberrantly localizes as a constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated enzyme to detergent-insoluble and mitochondrial fractions of resting cardiomyocytes; relatively little KD-PKC\u03b4-K376R remains in the cytosolic fraction. The aberrant localization and tyrosine phosphorylation patterns for KD-PKC\u03b4-K376R do not phenocopy the properties of native PKC\u03b4, even in cells chronically treated with GF109203X to inhibit PKC\u03b4 activity. Hence, while KD-PKC\u03b4-K376R overexpression increases Shc localization to the detergent-insoluble and mitochondrial fractions, the significance of these results is uncertain. Our studies suggest that experiments using KD-PKC\u03b4-K376R overexpression as a strategy to competitively inhibit the kinase-dependent actions of native PKC\u03b4 or to expose the kinase-independent scaffolding functions of PKC\u03b4 should be interpreted with caution.",

        "Abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) exert pleiotropic effects on a wide array of signaling proteins that regulate cellular growth and apoptosis. This study shows that long-term treatment with a low concentration of H2O2 leads to the activation of signaling pathways involving extracellular signal-regulated kinase, ribosomal protein S6 kinase, and protein kinase D (PKD) that increase cAMP binding response element protein (CREB) phosphorylation at Ser(133) in cardiomyocytes. Although CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation typically mediates cAMP-dependent increases in CREB target gene expression, the H2O2-dependent increase in CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation is accompanied by a decrease in CREB protein abundance and no change in Cre-luciferase reporter activity. Mutagenesis studies indicate that H2O2 decreases CREB protein abundance via a mechanism that does not require CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation. Rather, the H2O2-dependent decrease in CREB protein is prevented by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, by inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase or protein kinase C activity, or by adenoviral-mediated delivery of a small interfering RNA that decreases PKD1 expression. A PKD1-dependent mechanism that links oxidative stress to decreased CREB protein abundance is predicted to contribute to the pathogenesis of heart failure by influencing cardiac growth and apoptosis responses.",

In vitro kinase assays revealed that lysates prepared from resting cardiomyocytes contain cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cTnT kinase activity. cTnI phosphorylation is inhibited by pharmacologic inhibitors of PKA, PKC, Rho kinase and PKC effectors such as RSK and PKD; these kinase inhibitors do not inhibit phosphorylation of cTnT. Rather, cTnT phosphorylation is decreased by the Raf inhibitor GW5074. In vitro kinase assays show that recombinant Raf phosphorylates cTnT, and that Raf-dependent cTnT phosphorylation is abrogated by a T206E substitution; Raf does not phosphorylate cTnI. These studies identify Raf-dependent cTnT-Thr(206) phosphorylation as a novel mechanism that would link growth factor-dependent signaling pathways to dynamic changes in cardiac contractile function.",

        "Title": "Regulatory autophosphorylation sites on protein kinase C-delta at threonine-141 and threonine-295.",
        "Abstract": "Protein kinase C-delta (PKCdelta) is a Ser/Thr kinase that regulates a wide range of cellular responses. This study identifies novel in vitro PKCdelta autophosphorylation sites at Thr(141) adjacent to the pseudosubstrate domain, Thr(218) in the C1A-C1B interdomain, Ser(295), Ser(302), and Ser(304) in the hinge region, and Ser(503) adjacent to Thr(505) in the activation loop. Cell-based studies show that Thr(141) and Thr(295) also are phosphorylated in vivo and that Thr(141) phosphorylation regulates the kinetics of PKCdelta downregulation in COS7 cells. In vitro studies implicate Thr(141) and Thr(295) autophosphorylation as modifications that regulate PKCdelta activity. A T141D substitution markedly increases basal lipid-independent PKCdelta activity; the PKCdelta-T141D mutant is only slightly further stimulated in vitro by PMA treatment, suggesting that Thr(141) phosphorylation relieves autoinhibitory constraints that limit PKCdelta activity. Mutagenesis studies also indicate that a phosphorylation at Thr(295) contributes to the control of PKCdelta substrate specificity. We previously demonstrated that PKCdelta phosphorylates the myofilament protein cardiac troponin I (cTnI) at Ser(23)/Ser(24) when it is allosterically activated by lipid cofactors and that the Thr(505)/Tyr(311)-phosphorylated form of PKCdelta (that is present in assays with Src) acquires as additional activity toward cTnI-Thr(144). Studies reported herein show that a T505A substitution reduces PKCdelta-Thr(295) autophosphorylation and that a T295A substitution leads to a defect in Src-dependent PKCdelta-Tyr(311) phosphorylation and PKCdelta-dependent cTnI-Thr(144) phosphorylation. These results implicate PKCdelta-Thr(295) autophosphorylation as a lipid-dependent modification that links PKCdelta-Thr(505) phosphorylation to Src-dependent regulation of PKCdelta catalytic function. Collectively, these studies identify novel regulatory autophosphorylations on PKCdelta that serve as markers and regulators of PKCdelta activity.",

        "Abstract": "p66Shc is an adapter protein that is induced by hypertrophic stimuli and has been implicated as a major regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cardiovascular oxidative stress responses. This study implicates p66Shc in an alpha(1)-adrenergtic receptor (alpha(1)-AR) pathway that requires the cooperative effects of protein kinase (PK)Cepsilon and PKCdelta and leads to AKT-FOXO3a phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes. alpha(1)-ARs promote p66Shc-YY(239/240) phosphorylation via a ROS-dependent mechanism that is localized to caveolae and requires epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and PKCepsilon activity. alpha(1)-ARs also increase p66Shc-S(36) phosphorylation via an EGFR transactivation pathway involving PKCdelta. p66Shc links alpha(1)-ARs to an AKT signaling pathway that selectively phosphorylates/inactivates FOXO transcription factors and downregulates the ROS-scavenging protein manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD); the alpha(1)-AR-p66Shc-dependent pathway involving AKT does not regulate GSK3. Additional studies show that RNA interference-mediated downregulation of endogenous p66Shc leads to the derepression of FOXO3a-regulated genes such as MnSOD, p27Kip1, and BIM-1. p66Shc downregulation also increases proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, suggesting that p66Shc exerts an antihypertrophic action in neonatal cardiomyocytes. The novel alpha(1)-AR- and ROS-dependent pathway involving p66Shc identified in this study is likely to contribute to cardiomyocyte remodeling and the evolution of heart failure.",

        "Title": "Protein kinase D1 autophosphorylation via distinct mechanisms at Ser744/Ser748 and Ser916.",
        "Abstract": "Protein kinase D1 (PKD1) is a physiologically important signaling enzyme that is activated via protein kinase C-dependent trans-phosphorylation of the activation loop at Ser744 and Ser748 followed by PKD1 autophosphorylation at Ser916. Although PKD-Ser916 autophosphorylation is widely used to track cellular PKD activity, this study exposes conditions leading to increased PKD-Ser(P)916 immunoreactivity without an associated increase in PKD activity in cardiomyocytes that heterologously overexpress catalytically inactive PKD1 and in cardiomyocytes treated with G\u00f66976 (a PKD inhibitor that competes with ATP). In each case, PKD1 is detected as a Ser916-phosphorylated enzyme that lacks kinase activity. In vitro kinase assays reconcile these seemingly discrepant findings by demonstrating that PKD1-Ser916 autophosphorylation can proceed via either an intermolecular reaction or an intramolecular autophosphorylation that requires only very low ATP concentrations that do not support target substrate phosphorylation. Additional studies show that Ser744 and Ser748 are targets for a protein kinase C-independent autocatalytic phosphorylation and that the PKD1-S744A/S748A mutant is a Ser916-phosphorylated enzyme that is not active toward heterologous substrates. In contrast, PKD1-S916A is an active kinase that autophosphorylates at Ser744. However, the S916A substitution leads to a Ser748 phosphorylation defect and a prolonged cellular PKD1 signaling response. Collectively, these results implicate PKD1-Ser744 phosphorylation in the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-dependent mechanism that increases PKD1 activity toward physiologically relevant substrates. We show that PKD1-Ser916 autophosphorylation does not necessarily correlate with PKD1 activity. Rather, autophosphorylation at Ser916 is required for subsequent autophosphorylation at Ser748. Finally, this study exposes a novel role for Ser916 and/or Ser748 autophosphorylation to terminate the cellular PKD1 signaling response.",

        "Abstract": "Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms comprise a family of lipid-activated enzymes that have been implicated in a wide range of cellular functions. PKCs are modular enzymes comprised of a regulatory domain (that contains the membrane-targeting motifs that respond to lipid cofactors, and in the case of some PKCs calcium) and a relatively conserved catalytic domain that binds ATP and substrates. These enzymes are coexpressed and respond to similar stimulatory agonists in many cell types. However, there is growing evidence that individual PKC isoforms subserve unique (and in some cases opposing) functions in cells, at least in part as a result of isoform-specific subcellular compartmentalization patterns, protein-protein interactions, and posttranslational modifications that influence catalytic function. This review focuses on the structural basis for differences in lipid cofactor responsiveness for individual PKC isoforms, the regulatory phosphorylations that control the normal maturation, activation, signaling function, and downregulation of these enzymes, and the intra-/intermolecular interactions that control PKC isoform activation and subcellular targeting in cells. A detailed understanding of the unique molecular features that underlie isoform-specific posttranslational modification patterns, protein-protein interactions, and subcellular targeting (i.e., that impart functional specificity) should provide the basis for the design of novel PKC isoform-specific activator or inhibitor compounds that can achieve therapeutically useful changes in PKC signaling in cells.",

        "Abstract": "Previously, we have shown that murine HCN2 channels over-expressed in newborn and adult cardiac myocytes produce currents with different biophysical characteristics. To investigate the role of tyrosine kinase modulation in these age-dependent differences, we employed the broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor erbstatin. Our results demonstrated distinct and separable effects of erbstatin on channel gating and current amplitude and a marked age dependence to these effects. In newborn myocytes, erbstatin decreased current amplitude, shifted the activation relation negative, and slowed activation kinetics. The effect on activation voltage but not that on amplitude was absent when expressing a cAMP-insensitive mutant (HCN2R/E), while a C-terminal truncated form of HCN2 (HCN2DeltaCx) exhibited only the voltage dependent but not the amplitude effect of erbstatin. Thus, the action of erbstatin on the activation relation and current amplitude are distinct and separable in newborn myocytes, and the effect on activation voltage depends on the cAMP status of HCN2 channels. In contrast to newborn myocytes, erbstatin had no effect on HCN2 under control conditions in adult myocytes but induced a negative shift with no change in amplitude when saturated cAMP was added to the pipette solution. We conclude that erbstatin's effects on HCN2 current magnitude and voltage dependence are distinct and separable, and there are fundamental developmental differences in the heart that affect channel function and its modulation by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erbstatin.",

        "Abstract": "Our study identifies tyrosine phosphorylation as a novel protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) activation mechanism that modifies PKCdelta-dependent phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), a myofilament regulatory protein. PKCdelta phosphorylates cTnI at Ser23/Ser24 when activated by lipid cofactors; Src phosphorylates PKCdelta at Tyr311 and Tyr332 leading to enhanced PKCdelta autophosphorylation at Thr505 (its activation loop) and PKCdelta-dependent cTnI phosphorylation at both Ser23/Ser24 and Thr144. The Src-dependent acquisition of cTnI-Thr144 kinase activity is abrogated by Y311F or T505A substitutions. Treatment of detergent-extracted single cardiomyocytes with lipid-activated PKCdelta induces depressed tension at submaximum but not maximum [Ca2+] as expected for cTnI-Ser23/Ser24 phosphorylation. Treatment of myocytes with Src-activated PKCdelta leads to depressed maximum tension and cross-bridge kinetics, attributable to a dominant effect of cTnI-Thr144 phosphorylation. Our data implicate PKCdelta-Tyr311/Thr505 phosphorylation as dynamically regulated modifications that alter PKCdelta enzymology and allow for stimulus-specific control of cardiac mechanics during growth factor stimulation and oxidative stress.",

        "Abstract": "Protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) activation is generally attributed to lipid cofactor-dependent allosteric activation mechanisms at membranes. However, recent studies indicate that PKCdelta also is dynamically regulated through tyrosine phosphorylation in H(2)O(2)- and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-treated cardiomyocytes. H(2)O(2) activates Src and related Src-family kinases (SFKs), which function as dual PKCdelta-Tyr(311) and -Tyr(332) kinases in vitro and contribute to H(2)O(2)-dependent PKCdelta-Tyr(311)/Tyr(332) phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes and in mouse embryo fibroblasts. H(2)O(2)-dependent PKCdelta-Tyr(311)/Tyr(332) phosphorylation is defective in SYF cells (deficient in SFKs) and restored by Src re-expression. PMA also promotes PKCdelta-Tyr(311) phosphorylation, but this is not associated with SFK activation or PKCdelta-Tyr(332) phosphorylation. Rather, PMA increases PKCdelta-Tyr(311) phosphorylation by delivering PKCdelta to SFK-enriched caveolae. Cyclodextrin treatment disrupts caveolae and blocks PMA-dependent PKCdelta-Tyr(311) phosphorylation, without blocking H(2)O(2)-dependent PKCdelta-Tyr(311) phosphorylation. The enzyme that acts as a PKCdelta-Tyr(311) kinase without increasing PKCdelta phosphorylation at Tyr(332) in PMA-treated cardiomyocytes is uncertain. Although in vitro kinase assays implicate c-Abl as a selective PKCdelta-Tyr(311) kinase, PMA-dependent PKCdelta-Tyr(311) phosphorylation persists in cardiomyocytes treated with the c-Abl inhibitor ST1571 and c-Abl is not detected in caveolae; these results effectively exclude a c-Abl-dependent process. Finally, we show that 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol mimics the effect of PMA to drive PKCdelta to caveolae and increase PKCdelta-Tyr(311) phosphorylation, whereas G protein-coupled receptor agonists such as norepinephrine and endothelin-1 do not. These results suggest that norepinephrine and endothelin-1 increase 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol accumulation and activate PKCdelta exclusively in non-caveolae membranes. Collectively, these results identify stimulus-specific PKCdelta localization and tyrosine phosphorylation mechanisms that could be targeted for therapeutic advantage.",

        "Abstract": "Many growth regulatory stimuli promote cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) Ser(133) phosphorylation, but the physiologically relevant CREB-Ser(133) kinase(s) in the heart remains uncertain. This study identifies a novel role for protein kinase D (PKD) as an in vivo cardiac CREB-Ser(133) kinase. We show that thrombin activates a PKCdelta-PKD pathway leading to CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. alpha(1)-Adrenergic receptors also activate a PKCdelta-PKD-CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation pathway in cardiomyocytes. Of note, while the epidermal growth factor (EGF) promotes CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation via an ERK-RSK pathway in cardiac fibroblasts, the thrombin-dependent EGFR transactivation pathway leading to ERK-RSK activation does not lead to CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation in this cell type. Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of PKCdelta (but not PKCepsilon or PKCalpha) activates PKD; PKCdelta and PKD1-S744E/S748E overexpression both promote CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation. Pasteuralla multocida toxin (PMT), a direct Galpha(q) agonist that induces robust cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, also activates the PKD-CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation pathway, leading to the accumulation of active PKD and Ser(133)-phosphorylated CREB in the nucleus, activation of a CRE-responsive promoter, and increased Bcl-2 (CREB target gene) expression in cardiomyocyte cultures. Cardiac-specific Galpha(q) overexpression also leads to an increase in PKD-Ser(744)/Ser(748) and CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation as well as increased Bcl-2 protein expression in the hearts of transgenic mice. Collectively, these studies identify a novel Galpha(q)-PKCdelta-PKD-CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation pathway that is predicted to contribute to cardiac remodeling and could be targeted for therapeutic advantage in the setting of heart failure phenotypes.",

This study focuses on the expression and localization patterns for certain Gbeta and Ggamma subunits in neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes. We identify developmental downregulation of Gbeta1, Gbeta2, and Ggamma2, and a switch in the molecular form of Ggamma3, in cardiomyocytes. Gbeta1 is highly localized to caveolae membranes, whereas Gbeta2 is identified in caveolae and other membrane fractions. Gbeta3 is not detected in neonatal cardiomyocytes, but rather Gbeta3 is upregulated in adult cardiomyocytes and detected in the caveolae and soluble fractions. The observation that cardiomyocytes co-express multiple Gbeta and Ggamma subunits in a developmentally regulated manner, and that these Gbeta and Ggamma subunits assume distinct subcellular localization patterns, provides for a high level of signaling specificity in the heart.",

        "Title": "Novel mode for neutrophil protease cathepsin G-mediated signaling: membrane shedding of epidermal growth factor is required for cardiomyocyte anoikis.",
        "Abstract": "Neutrophils are thought to orchestrate myocardial remodeling during the early progression to cardiac failure through the release of reactive oxygen species, antimicrobial peptides, and proteases. Although neutrophil activation may be beneficial at early stages of disease, excessive neutrophil infiltration can induce cardiomyocyte death and tissue damage. The neutrophil-derived serine protease cathepsin G (Cat.G) has been shown to induce neonatal rat cardiomyocyte detachment and apoptosis by anoikis. However, the involved signaling mechanisms for Cat.G are not well understood. This study identifies epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation as a mechanism whereby Cat.G induces signaling in cardiomyocytes. Cat.G induced a rapid and transient increase in EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, and inhibition of EGFR kinase activity, either with AG1478 or by expression of kinase inactive EGFR mutants (EGFR-CD533), markedly attenuated EGFR downstream signaling and myocyte anoikis induced by Cat.G. Consistent with this effect of EGFR, high level expression of wild-type EGFR was sufficient to promote myocyte apoptosis. We also found that matrix metalloproteinase-dependent membrane shedding of heparin-binding EGF was involved in Cat.G signaling and that membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase activation may constitute a potential target that entails matrix metalloproteinase activation induced by Cat.G. The paradoxical proapoptotic effect of EGFR appeared to be dependent on protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (Src homology domain 2-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2) activation and focal adhesion kinase downregulation. These results show that Cat.G-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis involves an increase in EGFR-dependent activation of SHP2 that promotes focal adhesion kinase dephosphorylation and subsequent cardiomyocyte anoikis.",

        "Title": "Protein kinase Cepsilon (PKCepsilon) and Src control PKCdelta activation loop phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes.",
        "Abstract": "Protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) is unusual among AGC kinases in that it does not require activation loop (Thr(505)) phosphorylation for catalytic competence. Nevertheless, Thr(505) phosphorylation has been implicated as a mechanism that influences PKCdelta activity. This study examines the controls of PKCdelta-Thr(505) phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes. We implicate phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and PKCdelta autophosphorylation in the \"priming\" maturational PKCdelta-Thr(505) phosphorylation that accompanies de novo enzyme synthesis. In contrast, we show that PKCdelta-Thr(505) phosphorylation dynamically increases in cardiomyocytes treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor agonist norepinephrine via a mechanism that requires novel PKC isoform activity and not phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1. We used a PKCepsilon overexpression strategy as an initial approach to discriminate two possible novel PKC mechanisms, namely PKCdelta-Thr(505) autophosphorylation and PKCdelta-Thr(505) phosphorylation in trans by PKCepsilon. Our studies show that adenovirus-mediated PKCepsilon overexpression leads to an increase in PKCdelta-Thr(505) phosphorylation. However, this cannot be attributed to an effect of PKCepsilon to function as a direct PKCdelta-Thr(505) kinase, since the PKCepsilon-dependent increase in PKCdelta-Thr(505) phosphorylation is accompanied by (and dependent upon) increased PKCdelta phosphorylation at Tyr(311) and Tyr(332). Further studies implicate Src in this mechanism, showing that 1) PKCepsilon overexpression increases PKCdelta-Thr(505) phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes and Src(+) cells but not in SYF cells (that lack Src, Yes, and Fyn and exhibit a defect in PKCdelta-Tyr(311)/Tyr(332) phosphorylation), and 2) in vitro PKCdelta-Thr(505) autophosphorylation is augmented in assays performed with Src (which promotes PKCdelta-Tyr(311)/Tyr(332) phosphorylation). Collectively, these results identify a novel PKCdelta-Thr(505) autophosphorylation mechanism that is triggered by PKCepsilon overexpression and involves Src-dependent PKCdelta-Tyr(311)/Tyr(332) phosphorylation.",

        "Abstract": "AKT is a potent antiapoptotic kinase, but its role in the cardioprotective actions of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors (ARs) remains uncertain, because alpha(1)-ARs typically induce little-to-no AKT activation in most cardiomyocyte models. This study identifies a prominent alpha(1)-AR-dependent AKT activation pathway that is under tonic inhibitory control by novel protein kinase Cs (nPKCs) in neonatal rat cardiomyocyte cultures. We also implicate Pyk2, Pyk2 complex formation with PDK-1 and paxillin, and increased PDK-1-Y373/376 phosphorylation as the mechanism that links alpha(1)-AR activation to increased AKT phosphorylation. nPKCs (which are prominent alpha(1)-AR effectors) interfere with this alpha(1)-AR-dependent AKT activation by blocking Pyk2/PDK-1/paxillin complex formation and PDK-1-Y373/376 phosphorylation. Additional studies used an adenoviral-mediated overexpression strategy to show that Pyk2 exerts dual controls on antiapoptotic PDK-1/AKT and proapoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. Although the high nPKC activity of most cardiomyocyte models favors Pyk2 signaling to JNK (and cardiac apoptosis), the cardioprotective actions of Pyk2 through the PDK-1/AKT pathway are exposed when PKC or JNK activation is prevented. Collectively, these studies identify JNK and AKT as functionally distinct downstream components of the alpha(1)-AR/Pyk2 signaling pathway. We also implicate nPKCs as molecular switches that control the balance of signaling via proapoptotic JNK and antiapoptotic PDK-1/AKT pathways, exposing a novel mechanism for nPKC-dependent regulation of cardiac hypertrophy and failure.",

        "Title": "Distinct signaling functions for Shc isoforms in the heart.",
        "Abstract": "Thrombin activates protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) and engages signaling pathways that influence the growth and survival of cardiomyocytes as well as extracellular matrix remodeling by cardiac fibroblasts. This study examines the role of Shc proteins in PAR-1-dependent signaling pathways that influence ventricular remodeling. We show that thrombin increases p46Shc/p52Shc phosphorylation at Tyr(239)/Tyr(240) and Tyr(317) (and p66Shc-Ser(36) phosphorylation) via a pertussis toxin-insensitive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation pathway in cardiac fibroblasts; p66Shc-Ser(36) phosphorylation is via a MEK-dependent mechanism. In contrast, cardiac fibroblasts express beta(2)-adrenergic receptors that activate ERK through a pertussis toxin-sensitive EGFR transactivation pathway that does not involve Shc isoforms or lead to p66Shc-Ser(36) phosphorylation. In cardiomyocytes, thrombin triggers MEK-dependent p66Shc-Ser(36) phosphorylation, but this is not via EGFR transactivation (or associated with Shc-Tyr(239)/Tyr(240) and/or Tyr(317) phosphorylation). Importantly, p66Shc protein expression is detected in neonatal, but not adult, cardiomyocytes; p66Shc expression is induced (via a mechanism that requires protein kinase C and MEK activity) by Pasteurella multocida toxin, a Galpha(q) agonist that promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. These results identify novel regulation of individual Shc isoforms in receptor-dependent pathways leading to cardiac hypertrophy and the transition to heart failure. The observations that p66Shc expression is induced by a Galpha(q) agonist and that PAR-1 activation leads to p66Shc-Ser(36) phosphorylation identifies p66Shc as a novel candidate hypertrophy-induced mediator of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and heart failure.",

        "Abstract": "Antibodies that specifically recognize signaling proteins (or individual phosphorylation events at specific residues in proteins of interest) have become important tools in the study of signaling pathways. However, the recognition properties of many commercially available antibodies have not been fully characterized. In the course of studies exploring PKC-delta phosphorylation mechanisms in cardiomyocytes, we have demonstrated that a BD Transduction Laboratories anti-PKC-delta MAb (generally viewed as an anti-PKC-delta protein antibody) recognizes PKC-delta in resting, but not in PMA-treated, cardiomyocytes. The observations that PKC-delta immunoreactivity is preserved when cultures are treated with PMA in the presence of a the PKC inhibitor GF-109203X and that PKC-delta immunoreactivity is restored by in vitro acid phosphatase treatment indicate that the epitope recognized by the BD Transduction Laboratories anti-PKC-delta MAb is masked by phosphorylation. The BD Transduction Laboratories MAb is poorly suited for studies that compare PKC-delta expression in resting and agonist-activated samples (or in studies of the relationship between PKC-delta phosphorylation and PKC-delta downregulation) because it artifactually displays PKC-delta phosphorylation as a decline in total PKC-delta protein. Other studies have shown that two anti-PKC-delta-pY(311) antibodies (manufactured by Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, and BioSource International, Camarillo, CA, respectively) specifically recognize stimulus-induced changes in PKC-delta-Y(311) phosphorylation on the endogenous PKC-delta enzyme, but the Cell Signaling Technology anti-PKC-delta-pY(311) antibody provides a better measure of Y(311) phosphorylation in overexpressed PKC-delta. Collectively, these studies have identified features of anti-PKC-delta antibodies that affect the interpretation of immunoblot analysis experiments. These findings related to PKC-delta may be symptomatic of a more pervasive feature of immunoblot analysis studies of phosphoproteins in general.",

        "Abstract": "Voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel (Ca(v)1.2, L-type Ca(2+) channel) function is highly regulated by hormones and neurotransmitters in large part through the activation of kinases and phosphatases. Regulation of Ca(v)1.2 by protein kinase C (PKC) is of significant physiologic importance, mediating, in part, the cardiac response to hormonal regulation. Although PKC has been reported to mediate activation and/or inhibition of Ca(v)1.2 function, the molecular mechanisms mediating the response have not been definitively elucidated. We show that PKC forms a macromolecular complex with the alpha(1c) subunit of Ca(v)1.2 through direct interaction with the C terminus. This interaction leads to phosphorylation of the channel in response to activators of PKC. We identify Ser(1928) as the residue that is phosphorylated by PKC in vitro and in vivo. Ser(1928) has been identified previously as the site mediating, in part, the protein kinase A up-regulation of channel activity. Thus, the protein kinase A and PKC signaling pathways converge on the Ca(v)1.2 complex at Ser(1928) to increase channel activity. Our results identify two mechanisms leading to regulation of Ca(v)1.2 activity by PKC: pre-association of the channel with PKC isoforms and phosphorylation of specific sites within the alpha(1c) subunit.",

Traditional models of PKC activation have focused on lipid cofactors and anchoring proteins that localize the active conformation of PKCdelta to membranes, in close proximity with its target substrates. However, recent studies identify a distinct mode for PKCdelta activation involving tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases. The tyrosine-phosphorylated form of PKCdelta (which accumulates in the soluble fraction of cells exposed to oxidant stress) displays lipid-independent kinase activity and is uniquely positioned to phosphorylate target substrates throughout the cell (not just on lipid membranes). This review summarizes (1) recent progress towards understanding structure-activity relationships for PKCdelta, with a particular focus on the stimuli that induce (and the distinct functional consequences that result from) tyrosine phosphorylation events in PKCdelta's regulatory, hinge and catalytic domains; (2) current concepts regarding the role of tyrosine phosphorylation as a mechanism to regulate PKCdelta localization and actions in mitochondrial and nuclear compartments; and (3) recent literature delineating distinct roles for PKCdelta (relative to other PKC isoforms) in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression and programmed cell death (including studies in PKCdelta-/- mice that implicate PKCdelta in immune function and cardiovascular remodelling). Collectively, these studies argue that the conventional model for PKCdelta activation must be broadened to allow for stimulus-specific differences in PKCdelta signalling during growth factor stimulation and oxidant stress.",

        "Abstract": "Protease-activated receptors (PARs) comprise a family of G protein-coupled receptors with a unique proteolytic activation mechanism. PARs are activated by thrombin or other coagulation or inflammatory proteases formed at sites of tissue injury. PARs play a particularly important role in the pathogenesis of clinical disorders characterized by chronic inflammation or smoldering activation of the coagulation cascade. Individual PARs have been linked to the regulation of a broad range of cellular functions. Recent studies identify PAR family members in the vasculature (including within atherosclerotic lesions) and in the heart. Here, PAR-triggered responses contribute to vasoregulation and influence cardiac electrical and mechanical activity. PAR activation also is linked to structural remodeling of the vasculature and the myocardium. This review focuses on the cardiovascular actions of PARs that play a role in normal cardiovascular physiology and that are likely to contribute to cardiovascular diseases.",

        "Title": "Cardiomyocyte apoptosis triggered by RAFTK/pyk2 via Src kinase is antagonized by paxillin.",
        "Abstract": "Altered cellular adhesion and apoptotic signaling in cardiac remodeling requires coordinated regulation of multiple constituent proteins that comprise cytoskeletal focal adhesions. One such protein activated by cardiac remodeling is related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK, also known as pyk2). Adenoviral-mediated expression of RAFTK in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes involves concurrent increases in phosphorylation of Src, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 leading to characteristic apoptotic changes including cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, caspase-3 activation, and increased DNA laddering. DNA laddering was decreased by mutation of the Tyr(402) Src-binding site in RAFTK, suggesting a central role for Src activity in apoptotic cell death that was confirmed by adenoviral-mediated Src expression. Multiple apoptotic signaling cascades are recruited by RAFTK as demonstrated by prevention of apoptosis using caspase-3 inhibitor IV (caspase-3 specific inhibitor), PP2 (Src-specific kinase inhibitor), or Csk (cellular negative regulator for Src), as well as dominant negative constructs for p38beta or MKP-1. These RAFTK-mediated phenotypic characteristics are prevented by concurrent expression of wild-type or a phosphorylation-deficient paxillin mutated at Tyr(31) and Tyr(118). Wild-type or mutant paxillin protein accumulation in the cytoplasm has no overt effect upon cell structure, but paxillin accumulation prevents losses of myofibril organization as well as focal adhesion kinase, vinculin, and paxillin protein levels mediated by RAFTK. Apoptotic signaling cascade inhibition by paxillin indicates interruption of signaling proximal to but downstream of RAFTK activity. Chronic RAFTK activation in cardiac remodeling may represent a maladaptive reactive response that can be modulated by paxillin, opening up novel possibilities for inhibition of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and structural degeneration in heart failure.",

        "Title": "beta(2)-Adrenergic receptor signaling complexes in cardiomyocyte caveolae/lipid rafts.",
        "Abstract": "The traditional notion that catecholamine actions are mediated by the predominant beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)-AR) subtype linked to the activation of adenylyl cyclase and the accumulation of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) in cardiomyocytes has been challenged by recent studies showing that cardiomyocytes co-express pharmacologically distinct beta(2)-AR subtypes that activate a more broad range of downstream effectors. While beta(1)- and beta(2)-ARs exert largely functionally equivalent cellular actions in heterologous expression systems, signaling by endogenous beta-AR subtypes in highly differentiated cells such as cardiomyocytes can be strikingly different. There is growing evidence that certain features of the signaling phenotypes for beta-AR subtypes in cardiomyocytes are inconsistent with traditional models that attribute signaling specificity to high-affinity protein-protein interactions between receptors, G-proteins, and effectors freely mobile on surface membranes. This chapter summarizes recent studies that focus on membrane microdomains (such as caveolae or lipid rafts) as sites that differentially localizing individual beta-AR subtypes as well as the downstream signaling machinery that generates, propagates, and downregulates the cAMP-protein kinase A signaling pathway. To the extent that this mechanism calibrates beta-AR responses in cardiomyocytes, it would be expected to be pertinent to the pathogenesis of heart failure, where chronic/persistent beta-AR signaling contributes to ventricular remodeling and impacts on long-term survival.",

        "Title": "Stimulus-specific differences in protein kinase C delta localization and activation mechanisms in cardiomyocytes.",
        "Abstract": "Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms play key roles in the regulation of cardiac contraction, ischemic preconditioning, and hypertrophy/failure. Models of PKC activation generally focus on lipid cofactor-induced PKC translocation to membranes. This study identifies tyrosine phosphorylation as an additional mechanism that regulates PKC delta actions in cardiomyocytes. Using immunoblot analysis with antibodies to total PKC delta and PKC delta-pY(311), we demonstrate that PKC delta partitions between soluble and particulate fractions (with little Tyr(311) phosphorylation) in resting cardiomyocytes. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) promotes PKC delta translocation to membranes and phosphorylation at Tyr(311). H(2)O(2) also increases PKC delta-pY(311) in association with its release from membranes. Both PMA- and H(2)O(2)-dependent increases in PKC delta-pY(311) are mediated by Src family kinases, but they occur via different mechanisms. The H(2)O(2)-dependent increase in PKC delta-pY(311) results from Src activation and increased Src-PKC delta complex formation. The PMA-dependent increase in PKC delta-pY(311) results from a lipid cofactor-induced conformational change that renders PKC delta a better substrate for phosphorylation by precomplexed Src kinases (without Src activation). PKC delta-Y(311) phosphorylation does not grossly alter the kinetics of PMA-dependent PKC delta down-regulation. Rather, tyrosine phosphorylation regulates PKC delta kinase activity. PKC delta is recovered from the soluble fraction of H(2)O(2)-treated cardiomyocytes as a tyrosine-phosphorylated, lipid-independent enzyme with altered substrate specificity. In vitro PKC delta phosphorylation by Src also increases lipid-independent kinase activity. The magnitude of this effect varies, depending upon the substrate, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation fine-tunes PKC delta substrate specificity. The stimulus-specific modes for PKC delta signaling identified in this study allow for distinct PKC delta-mediated phosphorylation events and responses during growth factor stimulation and oxidant stress in cardiomyocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Cell culture studies demonstrate an increase in cardiac L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L) density on sympathetic innervation in vitro and suggest the effect depends on neurally released neuropeptide Y (NPY). To determine if a similar mechanism contributes to the postnatal increase in ICa,L in vivo, we prepared isolated ventricular myocytes from neonatal and adult mice with targeted deletion of the NPY gene (Npy-/-) and matched controls (Npy+/+). Whole-cell voltage clamp demonstrates ICa,L density increases postnatally in Npy+/+ (by 56%), but is unchanged in Npy-/-. Both ICa,L density and action potential duration are significantly greater in adult Npy+/+ than Npy-/- myocytes, whereas ICa,L density is equivalent in neonatal Npy+/+ and Npy-/- myocytes. These data indicate NPY does not influence ICa,L prenatally, but the postnatal increase in ICa,L density is entirely NPY-dependent. In contrast, there is a similar postnatal negative voltage shift in the I-V relation in Npy+/+ and Npy-/-, indicating NPY does not influence the developmental change in ICa,L voltage-dependence. Immunoblot analyses and measurements of maximally activated ICa,L (in presence of forskolin or BayK 8644) show that the differences in current density between Npy+/+ and Npy-/- cannot be attributed to altered Ca2+ channel alpha1C subunit protein expression. Rather, these results suggest that the in vivo NPY-dependent postnatal increase in ICa,L density in cardiac myocytes results from regulation ICa,L properties by NPY.",

        "Abstract": "Cardiomyocyte beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) provide a source of inotropic support and influence the evolution of heart failure. Recent studies identify distinct mechanisms for beta2-AR actions in neonatal and adult rat cardiomyocytes. This study examines whether ontogenic changes in cardiac beta2-AR actions can be attributed to altered Gi expression or changes in the spatial organization of the beta2-AR complex in membrane subdomains (caveolae). We show that beta2-ARs increase cAMP, calcium, and contractile amplitude in a pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive manner in neonatal cardiomyocytes. This is not caused by lack of Gi; Galphai expression is higher in neonatal cardiomyocytes than in those of adult rats. beta2-ARs provide inotropic support without detectably increasing cAMP, in adult cardiomyocytes. This cannot be attributed to dual coupling of beta2-ARs to Gs and Gi, because beta2-ARs do not promote cAMP accumulation in PTX-pretreated adult cardiomyocytes. Spatial segregation of beta2-ARs, Galphas/Galphai, and adenylyl cyclase to distinct membrane subdomains also is not a factor, because all of these proteins copurify in caveolin-3-enriched vesicles isolated from adult cardiomyocytes. However, these studies demonstrate that enzyme-based protocols routinely used to isolate ventricular cardiomyocytes lead to proteolysis of beta-ARs. The functional consequences of this limited beta-AR proteolysis is uncertain, because truncated beta1-ARs promote cAMP accumulation and truncated beta2-ARs provide inotropic support in adult cardiomyocytes. Collectively, these studies indicate that components of the beta2-AR signaling complex compartmentalize to restricted membrane subdomains in adult rat cardiomyocytes. Neither compartmentalization nor changes in Gi expression fully explain the ontogenic changes in beta2-AR responsiveness in the rat ventricle.",

        "Title": "Neutrophil cathepsin G promotes detachment-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis via a protease-activated receptor-independent mechanism.",
        "Abstract": "Cathepsin G is a neutrophil-derived serine protease that contributes to tissue damage at sites of inflammation. The actions of cathepsin G are reported to be mediated by protease-activated receptor (PAR)-4 (a thrombin receptor) in human platelets. This study provides the first evidence that cathepsin G promotes inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate accumulation, activates ERK, p38 MAPK, and AKT, and decreases contractile function in cardiomyocytes. Because some cathepsin G responses mimic cardiomyocyte activation by thrombin, a role for PARs was considered. Cathepsin G markedly activates phospholipase C and p38 MAPK in cardiomyocytes from PAR-1-/- mice, but it fails to activate phospholipase C, ERK, p38 MAPK, or AKT in PAR-1- or PAR-4-expressing PAR-1-/- fibroblasts (which display robust responses to thrombin). These results argue that PAR-1 does not mediate the actions of cathepsin G in cardiomyocytes, and neither PAR-1 nor PAR-4 mediates the actions of cathepsin G in fibroblasts. Of note, prolonged incubation of cardiomyocytes with cathepsin G results in the activation of caspase-3, cleavage of FAK and AKT, sarcomeric disassembly, cell rounding, cell detachment from underlying matrix, and morphologic features of apoptosis. Inhibition of Src family kinases or caspases (with PP1 or benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, respectively) delays FAK and AKT cleavage and cardiomyocyte detachment from substrate. Collectively, these studies describe novel cardiac actions of cathepsin G that do not require PARs and are predicted to assume functional importance at sites of interstitial inflammation in the heart.",

        "Abstract": "Caveolin-3 the muscle-specific caveolin isoform, acts like the more ubiquitously expressed caveolin-1 to sculpt caveolae, specialized membrane microdomains that serve as platforms to organize signal transduction pathways. Caveolin-2 is a structurally related isoform that alone does not drive caveolae biogenesis; rather, caveolin-2 cooperates with caveolin-1 to form caveolae in nonmuscle cells. Although caveolin-2 might be expected to interact in an fashion analogous to that of caveolin-3, it generally has not been detected in cardiomyocytes. This study shows that caveolin-2 and caveolin-3 are detected at low levels in ventricular myocardium and increase dramatically with age or when neonatal cardiomyocytes are placed in culture. In contrast, flotillins (caveolin functional homologs) are expressed at relatively constant levels in these preparations. In neonatal cardiac cultures, caveolin-2 and -3 expression is not influenced by thyroid hormone (a postnatal regulator of other cardiac gene products). The further evidence that caveolin-2 coimmunoprecipitates with caveolin-3 and floats with caveolin-3 by isopycnic centrifugation in cardiomyocyte cultures suggests that caveolin-2 may play a role in caveolae biogenesis and influence cardiac muscle physiology.",

        "Title": "Cross-regulation of novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoform function in cardiomyocytes. Role of PKC epsilon in activation loop phosphorylations and PKC delta in hydrophobic motif phosphorylations.",
        "Abstract": "Recent studies identify conventional protein kinase C (PKC) isoform phosphorylations at conserved residues in the activation loop and C terminus as maturational events that influence enzyme activity and targeting but are not dynamically regulated by second messengers. In contrast, this study identifies phorbol 12-myristoyl 13-acetate (PMA)- and norepinephrine-induced phosphorylations of PKC epsilon (at the C-terminal hydrophobic motif) and PKC delta (at the activation loop) as events that accompany endogenous novel PKC (nPKC) isoform activation in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Agonist-induced nPKC phosphorylations are prevented (and the kinetics of PMA-dependent PKC down-regulation are slowed) by pharmacologic inhibitors of nPKC kinase activity. PKC delta is recovered from PMA-treated cultures with increased in vitro lipid-independent kinase activity (and altered substrate specificity); the PMA-dependent increase in PKC delta kinase activity is attenuated when PKC delta activation loop phosphorylation is prevented. To distinguish roles of individual nPKC isoforms in nPKC phosphorylations, wild-type (WT) and dominant negative (DN) PKC delta and PKC epsilon mutants were introduced into cardiomyocyte cultures using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. WT-PKC delta and WT-PKC epsilon are highly phosphorylated at activation loop and hydrophobic motif sites, even in the absence of allosteric activators. DN-PKC delta is phosphorylated at the activation loop but not the hydrophobic motif; DN-PKC epsilon is phosphorylated at the hydrophobic motif but not the activation loop. Collectively, these results identify a role for PKC epsilon in nPKC activation loop phosphorylations and PKC delta in nPKC hydrophobic motif phosphorylations. Agonist-induced nPKC isoform phosphorylations that accompany activation/translocation of the enzyme contribute to the regulation of PKC delta kinase activity, may influence nPKC isoform trafficking/down-regulation, and introduce functionally important cross-talk for nPKC signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes.",

This study provides novel evidence that cardiomyocytes express functional PAR-4 whose signaling phenotype is distinct from PAR-1 in cardiomyocytes. AYPGKF, a modified PAR-4 agonist with increased potency at PAR-4, activates p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase but is a weak activator of phospholipase C, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy; AYPGKF and thrombin, but not the PAR-1 agonist SFLLRN, activate Src. The observation that AYPGKF and thrombin activate Src in cardiomyocytes cultured from PAR-1(-/-) mice establishes that Src activation is via PAR-4 (and not PAR-1) in cardiomyocytes. Further studies implicate Src and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase activity in the PAR-4-dependent p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Thrombin phosphorylates EGFRs and ErbB2 via a PP1-sensitive pathway in PAR-1(-/-) cells that stably overexpress PAR-4; the Src-mediated pathway for EGFR/ErbB2 transactivation underlies the protracted phases of thrombin-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in PAR-1(-/-) cells that overexpress PAR-4 and in cardiomyocytes. These studies identify a unique signaling phenotype for PAR-4 (relative to other cardiomyocyte G protein-coupled receptors) that is predicted to contribute to cardiac remodeling and influence the functional outcome at sites of cardiac inflammation.",

We show that cardiomyocyte-specific inactivation of tumor suppressor PTEN results in hypertrophy, and unexpectedly, a dramatic decrease in cardiac contractility. Analysis of double-mutant mice revealed that the cardiac hypertrophy and the contractility defects could be genetically uncoupled. PI3Kalpha mediates the alteration in cell size while PI3Kgamma acts as a negative regulator of cardiac contractility. Mechanistically, PI3Kgamma inhibits cAMP production and hypercontractility can be reverted by blocking cAMP function. These data show that PTEN has an important in vivo role in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and GPCR signaling and identify a function for the PTEN-PI3Kgamma pathway in the modulation of heart muscle contractility.",

        "Abstract": "Proteases elaborated by inflammatory cells in the heart would be expected to drive cardiac fibroblasts to proliferate, but protease-activated receptor (PAR) function in cardiac fibroblasts has never been considered. This study demonstrates that PAR-1 is the only known PAR family member functionally expressed by cardiac fibroblasts and that PAR-1 activation by thrombin leads to increased DNA synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts. The increase in DNA synthesis induced by PAR-1 substantially exceeds the effects of other G protein-coupled receptor agonists in this cell type. PAR-1 stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis and mobilizes intracellular calcium via pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive and PTX-insensitive pathways. Activation of PAR-1 leads to an increase in Src, Fyn, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation, with EGFR receptor transactivation by Src family kinases the major mechanism for PAR-1-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase, and protein kinase B. Activation of PAR-1 also leads to an increase in DNA synthesis. PAR-1 signaling is highly contextual in nature, inasmuch as PAR-1 activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase and only weakly stimulates protein kinase B via a pathway that does not involve EGFR transactivation in cardiomyocytes. PAR-1 responses in cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes are predicted to contribute importantly to remodeling during cardiac injury and/or inflammation.",

        "Title": "Caveolar localization dictates physiologic signaling of beta 2-adrenoceptors in neonatal cardiac myocytes.",
        "Abstract": "There is a growing body of evidence that G protein-coupled receptors function in the context of plasma membrane signaling compartments. These compartments may facilitate interaction between receptors and specific downstream signaling components while restricting access to other signaling molecules. We recently reported that beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors (AR) regulate the intrinsic contraction rate in neonatal mouse myocytes through distinct signaling pathways. By studying neonatal myocytes isolated from beta(1)AR and beta(2)AR knockout mice, we found that stimulation of the beta(1)AR leads to a protein kinase A-dependent increase in the contraction rate. In contrast, stimulation of the beta(2)AR has a biphasic effect on the contraction rate. The biphasic effect includes an initial protein kinase A-independent increase in the contraction rate followed by a sustained decrease in the contraction rate that can be blocked by pertussis toxin. Here we present evidence that caveolar localization is required for physiologic signaling by the beta(2)AR but not the beta(1)AR in neonatal cardiac myocytes. Evidence for beta(2)AR localization to caveolae includes co-localization by confocal imaging, co-immunoprecipitation of the beta(2)AR and caveolin 3, and co-migration of the beta(2)AR with a caveolin-3-enriched membrane fraction. The beta(2)AR-stimulated increase in the myocyte contraction rate is increased by approximately 2-fold and markedly prolonged by filipin, an agent that disrupts lipid rafts such as caveolae and significantly reduces co-immunoprecipitation of beta(2)AR and caveolin 3 and co-migration of beta(2)AR and caveolin-3 enriched membranes. In contrast, filipin has no effect on beta(1)AR signaling. These observations suggest that beta(2)ARs are normally restricted to caveolae in myocyte membranes and that this localization is essential for physiologic signaling of this receptor subtype.",

        "Abstract": "Previous attempts to delineate the consequences of Galpha (q) activation in cardiomyocytes relied largely on molecular strategies in cultures or transgenic mice. Modest levels of wild-type Galpha(q) overexpression induce stable cardiac hypertrophy, whereas intense Galpha(q) stimulation induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The precise mechanism(s) whereby traditional targets of Galpha (q) subunits that induce hypertrophy also trigger cardiomyocyte apoptosis is not obvious and is explored with recombinant Pasteurella multocida toxin (rPMT, a Galpha(q) agonist). Cells cultured with rPMT display cardiomyocyte enlargement, sarcomeric organization, and increased atrial natriuretic factor expression in association with activation of phospholipase C, novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), and (to a lesser extent) JNK/p38-MAPK. rPMT stimulates the ERK cascade via epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor transactivation in cardiac fibroblasts, but EGF receptor transactivation plays no role in ERK activation in cardiomyocytes. Surprisingly, rPMT (or novel PKC isoform activation by PMA) decreases basal Akt phosphorylation; rPMT prevents Akt phosphorylation by EGF or IGF-1 and functionally augments cardiomyocyte apoptosis in response to H2O2. These results identify a Galpha(q)-PKC pathway that represses basal Akt phosphorylation and impairs Akt stimulation by survival factors. Because inhibition of Akt enhances cardiomyocyte susceptibility to apoptosis, this pathway is predicted to contribute to the transition from hypertrophy to cardiac decompensation and could be targeted for therapy in heart failure.",

        "Title": "beta(1)-Receptors increase cAMP and induce abnormal Ca(i) cycling in the German shepherd sudden death model.",
        "Abstract": "We studied the role of beta-adrenergic receptor subtype signaling to cAMP and calcium in the genesis of catecholamine-dependent arrhythmias in German shepherd dogs that develop lethal arrhythmias at ~5 mo of age. There were three major findings in this study: 1) isoproterenol induces similar increases in cAMP in afflicted and control dogs exclusively through beta(1)-receptors (not beta(2)), 2) cells from afflicted dogs display prolonged relaxation kinetics at long cycle lengths and large frequent spontaneous calcium oscillations (and aftercontractions) with little increase in calcium transient amplitude in response to beta(1)-receptor agonists, and 3) beta(2)-receptor agonists induce a similar marked increases in calcium transient and twitch amplitude, with only rare spontaneous calcium oscillations in afflicted and control cells. These results indicate that catecholamines provide inotropic support to canine cardiomyocytes through distinct beta(1)- and beta(2)-receptor pathways with differing requirements for cAMP. The propensity to develop arrhythmias is not induced by beta(2)-receptors (or a rise in calcium alone), but rather occurs in the context of beta(1)-receptor activation of the cAMP-dependent pathway.",

        "Title": "Beta 2-adrenergic receptor signaling acts via NO release to mediate ACh-induced activation of ATP-sensitive K+ current in cat atrial myocytes.",
        "Abstract": "In atrial myocytes, an initial exposure to isoproterenol (ISO) acts via cAMP to mediate a subsequent acetylcholine (ACh)-induced activation of ATP-sensitive K(+) current (I(K,ATP)). In addition, beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) stimulation activates nitric oxide (NO) release. The present study determined whether the conditioning effect of beta-AR stimulation acts via beta(1)- and/or beta(2)-ARs and whether it is mediated via NO signaling. 0.1 microM ISO plus ICI 118,551 (ISO-beta(1)-AR stimulation) or ISO plus atenolol (ISO-beta(2)-AR stimulation) both increased L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) markedly, but only ISO-beta(2)-AR stimulation mediated ACh-induced activation of I(K,ATP). 1 microM zinterol (beta(2)-AR agonist) also increased I(Ca,L) and mediated ACh-activated I(K,ATP). Inhibition of NO synthase (10 microM L-NIO), guanylate cyclase (10 microM ODQ), or cAMP-PKA (50 microM Rp-cAMPs) attenuated zinterol-induced stimulation of I(Ca,L) and abolished ACh-activated I(K,ATP). Spermine-NO (100 microM; an NO donor) mimicked beta(2)-AR stimulation, and its effects were abolished by Rp-cAMPs. Intracellular dialysis of 20 microM protein kinase inhibitory peptide (PKI) abolished zinterol-induced stimulation of I(Ca,L). Measurements of intracellular NO ([NO](i)) using the fluorescent indicator DAF-2 showed that ISO-beta(2)-AR stimulation or zinterol increased [NO](i). L-NIO (10 microM) blocked ISO- and zinterol-induced increases in [NO](i). ISO-beta(1)-AR stimulation failed to increase [NO](i). Inhibition of G(i)-protein by pertussis toxin significantly inhibited zinterol-mediated increases in [NO](i). Wortmannin (0.2 microM) or LY294002 (10 microM), inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI-3K), abolished the effects of zinterol to both mediate ACh-activated I(K,ATP) and stimulate [NO](i). We conclude that both beta(1)- and beta(2)-ARs stimulate cAMP. beta(2)-ARs act via two signaling pathways to stimulate cAMP, one of which is mediated via G(i)-protein and PI-3K coupled to NO-cGMP signaling. Only beta(2)-ARs acting exclusively via NO signaling mediate ACh-induced activation of I(K,ATP). NO signaling also contributes to beta(2)-AR stimulation of I(Ca,L). The differential effects of beta(1)- and beta(2)-ARs can be explained by the coupling of these two beta-ARs to different effector signaling pathways.",
