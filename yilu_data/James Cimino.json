        "Abstract": "Efforts to reduce documentation burden (DocBurden) for all health professionals (HP) are aligned with national initiatives to improve clinician wellness and patient safety. Yet DocBurden has not been precisely defined, limiting national conversations and rigorous, reproducible, and meaningful measures. Increasing attention to DocBurden motivated this work to establish a standard definition of DocBurden, with the emergence of excessive DocBurden as a term.",

        "Abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have improved in predictive performance, but several challenges remain to be addressed before PRSs can be implemented in the clinic, including reduced predictive performance of PRSs in diverse populations, and the interpretation and communication of genetic results to both providers and patients. To address these challenges, the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network has developed a framework and pipeline for return of a PRS-based genome-informed risk assessment to 25,000 diverse adults and children as part of a clinical study. From an initial list of 23 conditions, ten were selected for implementation based on PRS performance, medical actionability and potential clinical utility, including cardiometabolic diseases and cancer. Standardized metrics were considered in the selection process, with additional consideration given to strength of evidence in African and Hispanic populations. We then developed a pipeline for clinical PRS implementation (score transfer to a clinical laboratory, validation and verification of score performance), and used genetic ancestry to calibrate PRS mean and variance, utilizing genetically diverse data from 13,475 participants of the All of Us Research Program cohort to train and test model parameters. Finally, we created a framework for regulatory compliance and developed a PRS clinical report for return to providers and for inclusion in an additional genome-informed risk assessment. The initial experience from eMERGE can inform the approach needed to implement PRS-based testing in diverse clinical settings.",

As electronic health records begin to include patients' genomic data, recommendations will be formulated at an increasing rate. This study examined recommendations related to the current list of 73 actionable genes compiled by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and found that conditions fall generally into five classes (cardiovascular, medication interactions, metabolic, neoplastic, and structural), with recommendations falling into seven categories (actions or circumstances to avoid, evaluation of relatives at risk, pregnancy management, prevention of primary manifestations, prevention of secondary complications, surveillance, and treatment of manifestations). This study represents a first step in facilitating automated, scalable clinical decision support and provides direction on formal representation of the contexts and actions for clinical recommendations derived from genome-informed learning health systems.",

        "Abstract": "Widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHR) in the U.S. has been followed by unintended consequences, overexposing clinicians to widely reported EHR limitations. As an attempt to fixing the EHR, we propose the use of a clinical context ontology (CCO), applied to turn implicit contextual statements into formally represented data in the form of concept-relationship-concept tuples. These tuples form what we call a patient specific knowledge base (PSKB), a collection of formally defined tuples containing facts about the patient's care context. We report the process to create a CCO, which guides annotation of structured and narrative patient data to produce a PSKB. We also present an application of our PSKB using real patient data displayed on a semantically oriented patient summary to improve EHR navigation. Our approach can potentially save precious time spent by clinicians using today's EHRs, by showing a chronological view of the patient's record along with contextual statements needed for care decisions with minimum effort. We propose several other applications of a PSKB to improve multiple EHR functions to guide future research.",

        "Abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have improved in predictive performance supporting their use in clinical practice. Reduced predictive performance of PRS in diverse populations can exacerbate existing health disparities. The NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network is returning a PRS-based genome-informed risk assessment to 25,000 diverse adults and children. We assessed PRS performance, medical actionability, and potential clinical utility for 23 conditions. Standardized metrics were considered in the selection process with additional consideration given to strength of evidence in African and Hispanic populations. Ten conditions were selected with a range of high-risk thresholds: atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, chronic kidney disease, coronary heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, prostate cancer, asthma, type 1 diabetes, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. We developed a pipeline for clinical PRS implementation, used genetic ancestry to calibrate PRS mean and variance, created a framework for regulatory compliance, and developed a PRS clinical report. eMERGE's experience informs the infrastructure needed to implement PRS-based implementation in diverse clinical settings.",

        "Abstract": "With the burgeoning development of computational phenotypes, it is increasingly difficult to identify the right phenotype for the right tasks. This study uses a mixed-methods approach to develop and evaluate a novel metadata framework for retrieval of and reusing computational phenotypes. Twenty active phenotyping researchers from 2 large research networks, Electronic Medical Records and Genomics and Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, were recruited to suggest metadata elements. Once consensus was reached on 39 metadata elements, 47 new researchers were surveyed to evaluate the utility of the metadata framework. The survey consisted of 5-Likert multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions. Two more researchers were asked to use the metadata framework to annotate 8 type-2 diabetes mellitus phenotypes. More than 90% of the survey respondents rated metadata elements regarding phenotype definition and validation methods and metrics positively with a score of 4 or 5. Both researchers completed annotation of each phenotype within 60\u2009min. Our thematic analysis of the narrative feedback indicates that the metadata framework was effective in capturing rich and explicit descriptions and enabling the search for phenotypes, compliance with data standards, and comprehensive validation metrics. Current limitations were its complexity for data collection and the entailed human costs.",

        "Title": "Predictive models for abdominal aortic aneurysms using polygenic scores and PheWAS-derived risk factors.",
        "Abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are common enlargements of the abdominal aorta which can grow larger until rupture, often leading to death. Detection of AAA is often by ultrasonography and screening recommendations are mostly directed at men over 65 with a smoking history. Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified genetic loci associated with AAA risk. We combined known risk factors, polygenic risk scores (PRS) and precedent clinical diagnoses from electronic health records (EHR) to develop predictive models for AAA, and compared performance against screening recommendations. The PRS included genome-wide summary statistics from the Million Veteran Program and FinnGen (10,467 cases, 378,713 controls of European ancestry), with optimization in Vanderbilt's BioVU and validated in the eMERGE Network, separately across both White and Black participants. Candidate diagnoses were identified through a temporally-oriented Phenome-wide association study in independent EHR data from Vanderbilt, and features were selected via elastic net. We calculated C-statistics in eMERGE for models including PRS, phecodes, and covariates using regression weights from BioVU. The AUC for the full model in the test set was 0.883 (95% CI 0.873-0.892), 0.844 (0.836-0.851) for covariates only, 0.613 (95% CI 0.604-0.622) when using primary USPSTF screening criteria, and 0.632 (95% CI 0.623-0.642) using primary and secondary criteria. Brier scores were between 0.003 and 0.023 for our models indicating good calibration, and net reclassification improvement over combined primary and secondary USPSTF criteria was 0.36-0.60. We provide PRS for AAA which are strongly associated with AAA risk and add to predictive model performance. These models substantially improve identification of people at risk of a AAA diagnosis compared with existing guidelines, with evidence of potential applicability in minority populations.",

        "Abstract": "A panel sponsored by the American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI) at the 2021 AMIA Symposium addressed the provocative question: \"Are Electronic Health Records dumbing down clinicians?\" After reviewing electronic health record (EHR) development and evolution, the panel discussed how EHR use can impair care delivery. Both suboptimal functionality during EHR use and longer-term effects outside of EHR use can reduce clinicians' efficiencies, reasoning abilities, and knowledge. Panel members explored potential solutions to problems discussed. Progress will require significant engagement from clinician-users, educators, health systems, commercial vendors, regulators, and policy makers. Future EHR systems must become more user-focused and scalable and enable providers to work smarter to deliver improved care.",

        "Abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a worldwide scourge caused by both genetic and environmental risk factors that disproportionately afflicts communities of color. Leveraging existing large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), polygenic risk scores (PRS) have shown promise to complement established clinical risk factors and intervention paradigms, and improve early diagnosis and prevention of T2D. However, to date, T2D PRS have been most widely developed and validated in individuals of European descent. Comprehensive assessment of T2D PRS in non-European populations is critical for equitable deployment of PRS to clinical practice that benefits global populations.",

        "Abstract": "Given the growing number of prediction algorithms developed to predict COVID-19 mortality, we evaluated the transportability of a mortality prediction algorithm using a multi-national network of healthcare systems. We predicted COVID-19 mortality using baseline commonly measured laboratory values and standard demographic and clinical covariates across healthcare systems, countries, and continents. Specifically, we trained a Cox regression model with nine measured laboratory test values, standard demographics at admission, and comorbidity burden pre-admission. These models were compared at site, country, and continent level. Of the 39,969 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (68.6% male), 5717 (14.3%) died. In the Cox model, age, albumin, AST, creatine, CRP, and white blood cell count are most predictive of mortality. The baseline covariates are more predictive of mortality during the early days of COVID-19 hospitalization. Models trained at healthcare systems with larger cohort size largely retain good transportability performance when porting to different sites. The combination of routine laboratory test values at admission along with basic demographic features can predict mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Importantly, this potentially deployable model differs from prior work by demonstrating not only consistent performance but also reliable transportability across healthcare systems in the US and Europe, highlighting the generalizability of this model and the overall approach.",

Its intention was to provide physicians, medical librarians and others engaged in health care with a basic understanding of the major topics in informatics so that they could return to their home institutions as \"change agents\". Over the years, the course provided week-long, intense, morning-to-night experiences for some 1,350 students, consisting of lectures and hands-on project development, taught by many luminaries in the field, not the least of which was Donald A.B.\u00a0Lindberg M.D., who spoke on topics ranging from bioinformatics to national policy.",

        "Abstract": "Admissions are generally classified as COVID-19 hospitalizations if the patient has a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. However, because 35% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic, patients admitted for unrelated indications with an incidentally positive test could be misclassified as a COVID-19 hospitalization. Electronic health record (EHR)-based studies have been unable to distinguish between a hospitalization specifically for COVID-19 versus an incidental SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization. Although the need to improve classification of COVID-19 versus incidental SARS-CoV-2 is well understood, the magnitude of the problems has only been characterized in small, single-center studies. Furthermore, there have been no peer-reviewed studies evaluating methods for improving classification.",

        "Abstract": "The existence of systemic racism in US health care is widely recognized, but the role that informatics plays has received little attention. Clinical guidelines, which can incorporate implicit racial bias or be adhered to in racially disparate ways, are often the basis for clinical alerting systems. It is also possible that clinicians might be discriminatory in their response to alerts (for example, by deciding whether to agree or override the alert). We sought to study whether alert logic in our hospital uses patient race as part of its criteria and if alert override rates show any racial disparities. We obtained data on 5,120,114 alert events at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital and examined override the rates and reasons with respect to patient race. We found override rates of 82.27% and 81.30% for Black or African American patients and White patients, respectively. Some differences by alert were statistically significant but generally small. Override patterns varied by clinician but reasons given were generally not disparate, suggesting that if racist behavior is present, it is not widely systemic. However, the great variability in individual clinician behavior suggests that deeper analysis is warranted to determine whether disparities are indeed racist in nature.",

Melusin, a cardiac muscle-specific chaperone, exerts cardioprotective function under varied stressful conditions through activation of the AKT pathway.

Over the years, the course provided week-long, intense, morning-to-night experiences for some 1,350 students, consisting of lectures and hands-on project development, taught by many luminaries in the field, not the least of which was Donald A.B. Lindberg M.D., who spoke on topics ranging from bioinformatics to national policy.",

        "Abstract": "Development of evidence-based practice requires practice-based evidence, which can be acquired through analysis of real-world data from electronic health records (EHRs). The EHR contains volumes of information about patients-physical measurements, diagnoses, exposures, and markers of health behavior-that can be used to create algorithms for risk stratification or to gain insight into associations between exposures, interventions, and outcomes. But to transform real-world data into reliable real-world evidence, one must not only choose the correct analytical methods but also have an understanding of the quality, detail, provenance, and organization of the underlying source data and address the differences in these characteristics across sites when conducting analyses that span institutions. This manuscript explores the idiosyncrasies inherent in the capture, formatting, and standardization of EHR data and discusses the clinical domain and informatics competencies required to transform the raw clinical, real-world data into high-quality, fit-for-purpose analytical data sets used to generate real-world evidence.",

To define the prevalence of neurological conditions among hospitalized patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test in geographically diverse multinational populations during early pandemic, we used electronic health records (EHR) from 338 participating hospitals across 6 countries and 3 continents (January-September 2020) for a cross-sectional analysis. We assessed the frequency of International Classification of Disease code of neurological conditions by countries, healthcare systems, time before and after admission for COVID-19 and COVID-19 severity. Among 35,177 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was an increase in the proportion with disorders of consciousness (5.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.7-7.8%, p",

Many of the symptoms characterized as the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) could have multiple causes or are similarly seen in non-COVID patients. Accurate identification of PASC\u00a0phenotypes will be important to guide future research and help the healthcare system focus its efforts and resources on adequately controlled age- and gender-specific sequelae of a COVID-19 infection.",

        "Abstract": "Cardiovascular side effects are major shortcomings of cancer treatments causing cardiotoxicity and late-onset cardiomyopathy. While doxorubicin (Dox) has been reported as an effective chemotherapy agent, unspecific impairment in cardiomyocyte mitochondria activity has been documented. We demonstrated that the human fetal amniotic fluid-stem cell (hAFS) secretome, namely the secreted paracrine factors within the hAFS-conditioned medium (hAFS-CM), exerts pro-survival effects on Dox-exposed cardiomyocytes. Here, we provide a detailed comparison of the cardioprotective potential of hAFS-CM over the secretome of mesenchymal stromal cells from adipose tissue (hMSC-CM). hAFS and hMSC were preconditioned under hypoxia to enrich their secretome. The cardioprotective effects of hAFS/hMSC-CM were evaluated on murine neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes (mNVCM) and on their fibroblast counterpart (mNVFib), and their long-term paracrine effects were investigated in a mouse model of Dox-induced cardiomyopathy. Both secretomes significantly contributed to preserving mitochondrial metabolism within Dox-injured cardiac cells. hAFS-CM and hMSC-CM inhibited body weight loss, improved myocardial function, reduced lipid peroxidation and counteracted the impairment of mitochondrial complex I activity, oxygen consumption, and ATP synthesis induced by Dox. The hAFS and hMSC secretomes can be exploited for inhibiting cardiotoxic detrimental side effects of Dox during cancer therapy, thus ensuring cardioprotection via combinatorial paracrine therapy in association with standard oncological treatments.",

        "Abstract": "The recipients of NIH's Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) have worked for over a decade to build informatics infrastructure in support of clinical and translational research. This infrastructure has proved invaluable for supporting responses to the current COVID-19 pandemic through direct patient care, clinical decision support, training researchers and practitioners, as well as public health surveillance and clinical research to levels that could not have been accomplished without the years of ground-laying work by the CTSAs. In this paper, we provide a perspective on our COVID-19 work and present relevant results of a survey of CTSA sites to broaden our understanding of the key features of their informatics programs, the informatics-related challenges they have experienced under COVID-19, and some of the innovations and solutions they developed in response to the pandemic. Responses demonstrated increased reliance by healthcare providers and researchers on access to electronic health record (EHR) data, both for local needs and for sharing with other institutions and national consortia. The initial work of the CTSAs on data capture, standards, interchange, and sharing policies all contributed to solutions, best illustrated by the creation, in record time, of a national clinical data repository in the National COVID-19 Cohort Collaborative (N3C). The survey data support seven recommendations for areas of informatics and public health investment and further study to support clinical and translational research in the post-COVID-19 era.",

        "Abstract": "Coincident with the tsunami of COVID-19-related publications, there has been a surge of studies using real-world data, including those obtained from the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, several of these high-profile publications were retracted because of concerns regarding the soundness and quality of the studies and the EHR data they purported to analyze. These retractions highlight that although a small community of EHR informatics experts can readily identify strengths and flaws in EHR-derived studies, many medical editorial teams and otherwise sophisticated medical readers lack the framework to fully critically appraise these studies. In addition, conventional statistical analyses cannot overcome the need for an understanding of the opportunities and limitations of EHR-derived studies. We distill here from the broader informatics literature six key considerations that are crucial for appraising studies utilizing EHR data: data completeness, data collection and handling (eg, transformation), data type (ie, codified, textual), robustness of methods against EHR variability (within and across institutions, countries, and time), transparency of data and analytic code, and the multidisciplinary approach. These considerations will inform researchers, clinicians, and other stakeholders as to the recommended best practices in reviewing manuscripts, grants, and other outputs from EHR-data derived studies, and thereby promote and foster rigor, quality, and reliability of this rapidly growing field.",

        "Title": "Opportunity for Genotype-Guided Prescribing Among Adult Patients in 11 US Health Systems.",
        "Abstract": "The value of utilizing a multigene pharmacogenetic panel to tailor pharmacotherapy is contingent on the prevalence of prescribed medications with an actionable pharmacogenetic association. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) has categorized over 35 gene-drug pairs as \"level A,\" for which there is sufficiently strong evidence to recommend that genetic information be used to guide drug prescribing. The opportunity to use genetic information to tailor pharmacotherapy among adult patients was determined by elucidating the exposure to CPIC level A drugs among 11 Implementing Genomics In Practice Network (IGNITE)-affiliated health systems across the US. Inpatient and/or outpatient electronic-prescribing data were collected between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016 for patients\u00a0\u2265\u00a018\u00a0years of age who had at least one medical encounter that was eligible for drug prescribing in a calendar year. A median of ~\u00a07.2 million adult patients was available for assessment of drug prescribing per year. From 2011 to 2016, the annual estimated prevalence of exposure to at least one CPIC level A drug prescribed to unique patients ranged between 15,719 (95% confidence interval (CI): 15,658-15,781) in 2011 to 17,335 (CI: 17,283-17,386) in 2016 per 100,000 patients. The estimated annual exposure to at least 2 drugs was above 7,200 per 100,000 patients in most years of the study, reaching an apex of 7,660 (CI: 7,632-7,687) per 100,000 patients in 2014. An estimated 4,748 per 100,000 prescribing events were potentially eligible for a genotype-guided intervention. Results from this study show that a significant portion of adults treated at medical institutions across the United States is exposed to medications for which genetic information, if available, should be used to guide prescribing.",

        "Abstract": "PAGER-CoV (http://discovery.informatics.uab.edu/PAGER-CoV/) is a new web-based database that can help biomedical researchers interpret coronavirus-related functional genomic study results in the context of curated knowledge of host viral infection, inflammatory response, organ damage, and tissue repair. The new database consists of 11 835 PAGs (Pathways, Annotated gene-lists, or Gene signatures) from 33 public data sources. Through the web user interface, users can search by a query gene or a query term and retrieve significantly matched PAGs with all the curated information. Users can navigate from a PAG of interest to other related PAGs through either shared PAG-to-PAG co-membership relationships or PAG-to-PAG regulatory relationships, totaling 19 996 993. Users can also retrieve enriched PAGs from an input list of COVID-19 functional study result genes, customize the search data sources, and export all results for subsequent offline data analysis. In a case study, we performed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of a COVID-19 RNA-seq data set from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Compared with the results using the standard PAGER database, PAGER-CoV allows for more sensitive matching of known immune-related gene signatures. We expect PAGER-CoV to be invaluable for biomedical researchers to find molecular biology mechanisms and tailored therapeutics to treat COVID-19 patients.",

To do this, we formed an international consortium (4CE) of 96 hospitals across five countries (www.covidclinical.net). Contributors utilized the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) or Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) platforms to map to a common data model. The group focused on temporal changes in key laboratory test values. Harmonized data were analyzed locally and converted to a shared aggregate form for rapid analysis and visualization of regional differences and global commonalities. Data covered 27,584 COVID-19 cases with 187,802 laboratory tests. Case counts and laboratory trajectories were concordant with existing literature. Laboratory tests at the time of diagnosis showed hospital-level differences equivalent to country-level variation across the consortium partners. Despite the limitations of decentralized data generation, we established a framework to capture the trajectory of COVID-19 disease in patients and their response to interventions.",

        "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses societal challenges that require expeditious data and knowledge sharing. Though organizational clinical data are abundant, these are largely inaccessible to outside researchers. Statistical, machine learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale data beyond what is available in any given organization. Here, we introduce the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science community focused on analyzing patient-level data from many centers.",

        "Abstract": "Myocarditis can lead to autoimmune disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, and heart failure, which is modeled in the mouse by cardiac myosin immunization (experimental autoimmune myocarditis [EAM]). Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) systemic inhibition exerts both preventive and therapeutic effects in EAM, and STAT3 constitutive activation elicits immune-mediated myocarditis dependent on complement C3 and correlating with activation of the STAT3-interleukin 6 (IL-6) axis in the liver. Thus, liver-specific STAT3 inhibition may represent a therapeutic option, allowing to bypass the heart toxicity, predicted by systemic STAT3 inhibition. We therefore decided to explore the effectiveness of silencing liver Stat3 and C3 in preventing EAM onset and/or the recovery of cardiac functions. We first show that complement C3 and C5 genetic depletion significantly prevents the onset of spontaneous myocarditis, supporting the complement cascade as a viable target. In order to interfere with complement production and STAT3 activity specifically in the liver, we took advantage of liver-specific Stat3 or C3 small interfering (si)RNA nanoparticles, demonstrating that both siRNAs can significantly prevent myocarditis onset and improve the recovery of heart functions in EAM. Our data demonstrate that liver-specific Stat3/C3 siRNAs may represent a therapeutic option for autoimmune myocarditis and suggest that complement levels and activation might be predictive of progression to dilated cardiomyopathy.",

Significant progress in the development of echocardiographic equipment and transducers has led to the successful translation of this methodology from humans to rodents, allowing for the scoring of disease severity and progression, testing of new drugs, and monitoring cardiac function in genetically modified or pharmacologically treated animals. However, as yet, there is no standardization in the procedure to acquire echocardiographic measurements in small animals. This position paper focuses on the appropriate acquisition and analysis of echocardiographic parameters in adult mice and rats, and provides reference values, representative images, and videos for the accurate and reproducible quantification of left ventricular function in healthy and pathological conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic health records (EHRs) use alerts to help prevent medical errors, yet clinicians override many of these alerts due to desensitization from constant exposure (alert fatigue). We hypothesize that a clinician might override an alert warning about the dangers of a treatment if the patient's health is so poor that the treatment is worth the risk or if a patient's health suggests the treatment is not needed. We used logistic regression with general estimating equations to determine if the Early Warning Score (EWS), a measurement used to predict critical care need, could be used to predict alert overrides. EWS was a significant predictor of overrides for three alerts. Although EWS could not predict overrides for all alert rules, these results suggest that EWS may be helpful for some alerts, but that additional EHR data will be needed for predicting override behavior to a useful degree.",

        "Abstract": "Lack of diversity among genomic research participants results in disparities in benefits from genetic testing. To address this, the Alabama Genomic Health Initiative employed community engagement strategies to recruit diverse populations where they lived. In this paper, we describe our engagement techniques and recruitment strategies, which resulted in significant improvement in representation of African American participants. While African American participation has not reached the representation of this community as a percentage of Alabama's overall population (26%-27%), we have achieved an overall representation exceeding 20% for African Americans. We believe this demonstrates the value of engagement and recruitment where diverse populations reside.",

        "Abstract": "After over half a century of computer application development in medicine, the US health system has gone digital with an enthusiastic confidence for rapid improvements in care outcomes, especially those of quality of care, safety, and productivity. The bad news is that evidence for the justification of the hype around health information technology (HIT) is conflicting, and the expected benefits of a digital health system have not yet materialized. We propose a national system for monitoring HIT impact based on the paradigm of the learning health system (LHS): learning from practical experience through high-quality, ongoing monitoring of care outcomes. Our proposal aims at leveraging current de facto standard research data repositories used to support large-scale clinical studies by incorporating data needed for more robust HIT assessments and application of rigorous research designs that are now feasible on a large scale.",

Mediated query is commonly adopted to facilitate data access for investigators. However, the query mediation process remains a black-box. This study analyzed the email-based dialogues between investigators and clinical data query mediators from three institutions. We identify discussion topics and their frequencies, model task flows, and analyze user needs for query mediation support revealed from the dialogues. While the datasets between different institutions are distinct in some notable respects, we find that together they provide common insights for streamlining data access. From our findings, we conclude an intelligent dialogue-based query support model is feasible to automate human-mediated clinical data access for investigators and stakeholders.",

Many of these cohorts, however, are small, lack diversity, or do not provide comprehensive phenotype data. The All of Us Research Program plans to enroll a diverse group of at least 1 million persons in the United States in order to accelerate biomedical research and improve health. The program aims to make the research results accessible to participants, and it is developing new approaches to generate, access, and make data broadly available to approved researchers. All of Us opened for enrollment in May 2018 and currently enrolls participants 18 years of age or older from a network of more than 340 recruitment sites. Elements of the program protocol include health questionnaires, electronic health records (EHRs), physical measurements, the use of digital health technology, and the collection and analysis of biospecimens. As of July 2019, more than 175,000 participants had contributed biospecimens. More than 80% of these participants are from groups that have been historically underrepresented in biomedical research. EHR data on more than 112,000 participants from 34 sites have been collected. The All of Us data repository should permit researchers to take into account individual differences in lifestyle, socioeconomic factors, environment, and biologic characteristics in order to advance precision diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Complaints about electronic health records, including information overload, note bloat, and alert fatigue, are frequent topics of discussion. Despite substantial effort by researchers and industry, complaints continue noting serious adverse effects on patient safety and clinician quality of life. I believe solutions are possible if we can add information to the record that explains the \"why\" of a patient's care, such as relationships between symptoms, physical findings, diagnostic results, differential diagnoses, therapeutic plans, and goals. While this information may be present in clinical notes, I propose that we modify electronic health records to support explicit representation of this information using formal structure and controlled vocabularies. Such information could foster development of more situation-aware tools for data retrieval and synthesis. Informatics research is needed to understand what should be represented, how to capture it, and how to benefit those providing the information so that their workload is reduced.",

        "Abstract": "The US health system has recently achieved widespread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems, primarily driven by financial incentives provided by the Meaningful Use (MU) program. Although successful in promoting EHR adoption and use, the program, and other contributing factors, also produced important unintended consequences (UCs) with far-reaching implications for the US health system. Based on our own experiences from large health information technology (HIT) adoption projects and a collection of key studies in HIT evaluation, we discuss the most prominent UCs of MU: failed expectations, EHR market saturation, innovation vacuum, physician burnout, and data obfuscation. We identify challenges resulting from these UCs and provide recommendations for future research to empower the broader medical and informatics communities to realize the full potential of a now digitized health system. We believe that fixing these unanticipated effects will demand efforts from diverse players such as health care providers, administrators, HIT vendors, policy makers, informatics researchers, funding agencies, and outside developers; promotion of new business models; collaboration between academic medical centers and informatics research departments; and improved methods for evaluations of HIT.",

        "Abstract": "A robust biomedical informatics infrastructure is essential for academic health centers engaged in translational research. There are no templates for what such an infrastructure encompasses or how it is funded. An informatics workgroup within the Clinical and Translational Science Awards network conducted an analysis to identify the scope, governance, and funding of this infrastructure. After we identified the essential components of an informatics infrastructure, we surveyed informatics leaders at network institutions about the governance and sustainability of the different components. Results from 42 survey respondents showed significant variations in governance and sustainability; however, some trends also emerged. Core informatics components such as electronic data capture systems, electronic health records data repositories, and related tools had mixed models of funding including, fee-for-service, extramural grants, and institutional support. Several key components such as regulatory systems (e.g., electronic Institutional Review Board [IRB] systems, grants, and contracts), security systems, data warehouses, and clinical trials management systems were overwhelmingly supported as institutional infrastructure. The findings highlighted in this report are worth noting for academic health centers and funding agencies involved in planning current and future informatics infrastructure, which provides the foundation for a robust, data-driven clinical and translational research program.",

        "Abstract": "Precision medicine requires that groups of patients matching clinical or genetic characteristics be identified in a clinical care setting and treated with the appropriate intervention. In the clinical setting, this process is often facilitated by a patient registry. While the software architecture of federated patient registries for research has been well characterized, local registries focused on clinical quality and care have received less attention. Many clinical registries appear to be one-off projects that lack generalizability and the ability to scale to multiple diseases. We evaluate the applicability of existing registry guidelines for registries designed for clinical intervention, propose a software architecture more practical for single-institution clinical registries and report the implementation of a generalizable clinical patient registry architecture at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB).",

We carried out a four-phase analysis of clinical case studies to characterize how such processes are represented through relationships between clinical terms. The result is an terminology of 26 relationships that were validated against published clinical cases with 85.4% interrater reliability. We believe that capturing patient-specific information with these relationships can lead to improvements in clinical decision support systems, information retrieval and learning health systems.",

        "Abstract": "Vast volumes of data, coded through hierarchical terminologies (e.g., International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision-Clinical Modification [ICD10-CM], Medical Subject Headings [MeSH]), are generated routinely in electronic health record systems and medical literature databases. Although graphic representations can help to augment human understanding of such data sets, a graph with hundreds or thousands of nodes challenges human comprehension. To improve comprehension, new tools are needed to extract the overviews of such data sets. We aim to develop a visual interactive analytic tool for filtering and summarizing large health data sets coded with hierarchical terminologies (VIADS) as an online, and publicly accessible tool. The ultimate goals are to filter, summarize the health data sets, extract insights, compare and highlight the differences between various health data sets by using VIADS. The results generated from VIADS can be utilized as data-driven evidence to facilitate clinicians, clinical researchers, and health care administrators to make more informed clinical, research, and administrative decisions. We utilized the following tools and the development environments to develop VIADS: Django, Python, JavaScript, Vis.js, Graph.js, JQuery, Plotly, Chart.js, Unittest, R, and MySQL.",

We propose categories for study criteria corresponding to the effort needed for querying those criteria: \"easy\" (supporting automated queries), mixed (initial automated querying with manual review), \"hard\" (fully manual record review), and \"impossible\" or \"point of enrollment\" (not typically in health repositories). We obtained a sample of 292 criteria from 20 studies from ClinicalTrials.gov. Six independent reviewers, three each from two academic research institutions, rated criteria according to our four types. We observed high interrater reliability both within and between institutions. The analysis demonstrated typical features of criteria that map with varying levels of difficulty to repositories. We propose using these features to improve enrollment workflow through more standardized study criteria, self-service repository queries, and analyst-mediated retrievals.",

Such approaches are sorely needed, but there are few descriptions in the literature of prevailing practices to guide their use. A multidisciplinary workgroup was formed to examine current practices in the use of EHRs in recruitment and to propose future directions. The group surveyed consortium members regarding current practices. Over 98% of the Clinical and Translational Science Award Consortium responded to the survey. Brokered and self-service data warehouse access are in early or full operation at 94% and 92% of institutions, respectively, whereas, EHR alerts to providers and to research teams are at 45% and 48%, respectively, and use of patient portals for research is at 20%. However, these percentages increase significantly to 88% and above if planning and exploratory work were considered cumulatively. For most approaches, implementation reflected perceived demand. Regulatory and workflow processes were similarly varied, and many respondents described substantive restrictions arising from logistical constraints and limitations on collaboration and data sharing. Survey results reflect wide variation in implementation and approach, and point to strong need for comparative research and development of best practices to protect patients and facilitate interinstitutional collaboration and multisite research.",

        "Abstract": "Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin (DOX), are potent anticancer agents for the treatment of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. However, their clinical use is hampered by cardiotoxicity. This study sought to investigate the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase \u03b3 (PI3K\u03b3) in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and the potential cardioprotective and anticancer effects of PI3K\u03b3 inhibition.",

        "Abstract": "One of the challenges to using electronic health record (EHR) repositories for research is the difficulty mapping study subject eligibility criteria to the query capabilities of the repository. We sought to characterize criteria as \"easy\" (searchable in a typical repository), \"hard\" (requiring manual review of the record data), and \"impossible\" (not typically available in EHR repositories). We obtained 292 criteria from 20 studies available from Clinical Trials.gov and rated them according to our three types, plus a fourth \"mixed\" type. We had good agreement among three independent reviewers and chose 274 criteria that were characterized by single types for further analysis. The resulting analysis showed typical features of criteria that do and don't map to repositories. We propose that these features be used to guide researchers in specifying eligibility criteria to improve development of enrollment workflow, including the definition of EHR repository queries for self-service or analyst-mediated retrievals.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical narratives (the text notes found in patients' medical records) are important information sources for secondary use in research. However, in order to protect patient privacy, they must be de-identified prior to use. Manual de-identification is considered to be the gold standard approach but is tedious, expensive, slow, and impractical for use with large-scale clinical data. Automated or semi-automated de-identification using computer algorithms is a potentially promising alternative. The Informatics Institute of the University of Alabama at Birmingham is applying de-identification to clinical data drawn from the UAB hospital's electronic medical records system before releasing them for research. We participated in a shared task challenge by the Centers of Excellence in Genomic Science (CEGS) Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDoC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) at the de-identification regular track to gain experience developing our own automatic de-identification tool. We focused on the popular and successful methods from previous challenges: rule-based, dictionary-matching, and machine-learning approaches. We also explored new techniques such as disambiguation rules, term ambiguity measurement, and used multi-pass sieve framework at a micro level. For the challenge's primary measure (strict entity), our submissions achieved competitive results (f-measures: 87.3%, 87.1%, and 86.7%). For our preferred measure (binary token HIPAA), our submissions achieved superior results (f-measures: 93.7%, 93.6%, and 93%).

        "Abstract": "Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients affected by different disorders associated to intravascular hemolysis. The leading factor is the presence of pathologic amount of pro-oxidant free heme in the bloodstream, due to the exhaustion of the natural heme scavenger Hemopexin (Hx). Here, we evaluated whether free heme directly affects cardiac function, and tested the therapeutic potential of replenishing serum Hx for increasing serum heme buffering capacity. The effect of heme on cardiac function was assessed in vitro, on primary cardiomyocytes and H9c2 myoblast cell line, and in vivo, in Hx",

        "Abstract": "Physicians intuitively apply pattern recognition when evaluating a patient. Rational diagnosis making requires that clinical patterns be put in the context of disease prior probability, yet physicians often exhibit flawed probabilistic reasoning. Difficulties in making a diagnosis are reflected in the high rates of deadly and costly diagnostic errors. Introduced 6 decades ago, computerized diagnosis support systems are still not widely used by internists. These systems cannot efficiently recognize patterns and are unable to consider the base rate of potential diagnoses. We review the limitations of current computer-aided diagnosis support systems. We then portray future diagnosis support systems and provide a conceptual framework for their development. We argue for capturing physician knowledge using a novel knowledge representation model of the clinical picture. This model (based on structured patient presentation patterns) holds not only symptoms and signs but also their temporal and semantic interrelations. We call for the collection of crowdsourced, automatically deidentified, structured patient patterns as means to support distributed knowledge accumulation and maintenance. In this approach, each structured patient pattern adds to a self-growing and -maintaining knowledge base, sharing the experience of physicians worldwide. Besides supporting diagnosis by relating the symptoms and signs with the final diagnosis recorded, the collective pattern map can also provide disease base-rate estimates and real-time surveillance for early detection of outbreaks. We explain how health care in resource-limited settings can benefit from using this approach and how it can be applied to provide feedback-rich medical education for both students and practitioners.",

        "Abstract": "The information needs of clinicians, as they interact with the EHR, are well-studied. Clinical researchers also interact with the EHR and, while they might be expected to have some similar needs, the unique needs that arise due to nature of their work remain largely unstudied. For clinicians, infobuttons (context-aware hyperlinks) provide a mechanism of studying these information needs. Here we describe the integration of infobuttons into i2b2, a popular data warehouse commonly used by clinical researchers, using a plugin. A preliminary survey of i2b2 developers suggests a general interest in infobuttons for i2b2 and indicates good likelihood for their deployment, where they may be used as a tool for further studying these needs in greater detail.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to develop a high-fidelity prototype for delivering multi-gene sequencing panel (GS) reports to clinicians that simulates the user experience of a final application. The delivery and use of GS reports can occur within complex and high-paced healthcare environments. We employ a user-centered software design approach in a focus group setting in order to facilitate gathering rich contextual information from a diverse group of stakeholders potentially impacted by the delivery of GS reports relevant to two precision medicine programs at the University of Maryland Medical Center. Responses from focus group sessions were transcribed, coded and analyzed by two team members. Notification mechanisms and information resources preferred by participants from our first phase of focus groups were incorporated into scenarios and the design of a software prototype for delivering GS reports. The goal of our second phase of focus group, to gain input on the prototype software design, was accomplished through conducting task walkthroughs with GS reporting scenarios. Preferences for notification, content and consultation from genetics specialists appeared to depend upon familiarity with scenarios for ordering and delivering GS reports. Despite familiarity with some aspects of the scenarios we proposed, many of our participants agreed that they would likely seek consultation from a genetics specialist after viewing the test reports. In addition, participants offered design and content recommendations. Findings illustrated a need to support customized notification approaches, user-specific information, and access to genetics specialists with GS reports. These design principles can be incorporated into software applications that deliver GS reports. Our user-centered approach to conduct this assessment and the specific input we received from clinicians may also be relevant to others working on similar projects.",

        "Abstract": "Among other diseases characterized by the onset of cachexia, congestive heart failure takes a place of relevance, considering the high prevalence of this pathology in most European countries and in the United States, and is undergoing a rapid increase in developing countries. Actually, only few models of cardiac cachexia exist. Difficulties in the recruitment and follow-up of clinical trials implicate that new reproducible and well-characterized animal models are pivotal in developing therapeutic strategies for cachexia. We generated a new model of cardiac cachexia: a transgenic mouse expressing Tpr-Met receptor, the activated form of c-Met receptor of hepatocyte growth factor, specifically in the heart. We showed that the cardiac-specific induction of Tpr-Met raises a cardiac hypertrophic remodelling, which progresses into concentric hypertrophy with concomitant increase in Gdf15 mRNA levels. Hypertrophy progresses to congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, characterized by reduced body weight gain and food intake and skeletal muscle wasting. Prevention trial by suppressing Tpr-Met showed that loss of body weight could be prevented. Skeletal muscle wasting was also associated with altered gene expression profiling. We propose transgenic Tpr-Met mice as a new model of cardiac cachexia, which will constitute a powerful tool to understand such complex pathology and test new drugs/approaches at the preclinical level.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic health records (EHR) are a vital data resource for research uses, including cohort identification, phenotyping, pharmacovigilance, and public health surveillance. To realize the promise of EHR data for accelerating clinical research, it is imperative to enable efficient and autonomous EHR data interrogation by end users such as biomedical researchers. This paper surveys state-of-art approaches and key methodological considerations to this purpose. We adapted a previously published conceptual framework for interactive information retrieval, which defines three entities: user, channel, and source, by elaborating on channels for query formulation in the context of facilitating end users to interrogate EHR data. We show the current progress in biomedical informatics mainly lies in support for query execution and information modeling, primarily due to emphases on infrastructure development for data integration and data access via self-service query tools, but has neglected user support needed during iteratively query formulation processes, which can be costly and error-prone. In contrast, the information science literature has offered elaborate theories and methods for user modeling and query formulation support. The two bodies of literature are complementary, implying opportunities for cross-disciplinary idea exchange. On this basis, we outline the directions for future informatics research to improve our understanding of user needs and requirements for facilitating autonomous interrogation of EHR data by biomedical researchers. We suggest that cross-disciplinary translational research between biomedical informatics and information science can benefit our research in facilitating efficient data access in life sciences.",

        "Abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy is a major risk factor for heart failure. Hence, its attenuation represents an important clinical goal. Erk1,2 signalling is pivotal in the cardiac response to stress, suggesting that its inhibition may be a good strategy to revert heart hypertrophy. In this work, we unveiled the events associated with cardiac hypertrophy by means of a transgenic model expressing activated Met receptor. c-Met proto-oncogene encodes for the tyrosine kinase receptor of Hepatocyte growth factor and is a strong inducer of Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk1,2 pathway. We showed that three weeks after the induction of activated Met, the heart presents a remarkable concentric hypertrophy, with no signs of congestive failure and preserved contractility. Cardiac enlargement is accompanied by upregulation of growth-regulating transcription factors, natriuretic peptides, cytoskeletal proteins, and Extracellular Matrix remodelling factors (Timp1 and Pai1). At a later stage, cardiac hypertrophic remodelling results into heart failure with preserved systolic function. Prevention trial by suppressing activated Met showed that cardiac hypertrophy is reversible, and progression to heart failure is prevented. Notably, treatment with Pimasertib, Mek1 inhibitor, attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling. Our results suggest that modulation of Erk1.2 signalling may constitute a new therapeutic approach for treating cardiac hypertrophies.",

Understanding such communication is indispensable for designing intelligent human-machine dialog systems that automate query formulation. This study investigates email communication and proposes a novel scheme for classifying dialog acts in clinical research query mediation. We analyzed 315 email messages exchanged in the communication for 20 data requests obtained from three institutions. The messages were segmented into 1333 utterance units. Through a rigorous process, we developed a classification scheme and applied it for dialog act annotation of the extracted utterances. Evaluation results with high inter-annotator agreement demonstrate the reliability of this scheme. This dataset is used to contribute preliminary understanding of dialog acts distribution and conversation flow in this dialog space.",

        "Abstract": "The corrections (\"stipulations\") to a proposed research study protocol produced by an institutional review board (IRB) can often be repetitive across many studies; however, there is no standard set of stipulations that could be used, for example, by researchers wishing to anticipate and correct problems in their research proposals prior to submitting to an IRB. The objective of the research was to computationally identify the most repetitive types of stipulations generated in the course of IRB deliberations. The text of each stipulation was normalized using the natural language processing techniques. An undirected weighted network was constructed in which each stipulation was represented by a node, and each link, if present, had weight corresponding to the TF-IDF Cosine Similarity of the stipulations. Network analysis software was then used to identify clusters in the network representing similar stipulations. The final results were correlated with additional data to produce further insights about the IRB workflow. From a corpus of 18,582 stipulations we identified 31 types of repetitive stipulations. Those types accounted for 3,870 stipulations (20.8% of the corpus) produced for 697 (88.7%) of all protocols in 392 (also 88.7%) of all the CNS IRB meetings with stipulations entered in our data source. A notable peroportion of the corrections produced by the IRB can be considered highly repetitive. Our shareable method relied on a minimal manual analysis and provides an intuitive exploration with theoretically unbounded granularity. Finer granularity allowed for the insight that is anticipated to prevent the need for identifying the IRB panel expertise or any human supervision.",

We have developed an approach that attempts to represent such phenotypic data in its most atomic form to facilitate aggregation. We illustrate this approach with human blood antigen typing (ABO-Rh) data drawn from the National Institutes of Health's Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS). In applying the method to actual patient data, we discovered a 2% incidence of changed blood types. We believe our approach can be applied to any institution's data to obtain comparable patient phenotypes. The actual discrepant blood type data will form the basis for a future study of the reasons for blood typing variation.",

        "Abstract": "Efficient communication of a clinical study protocol and case report forms during all stages of a human clinical study is important for many stakeholders. An electronic and structured study representation format that can be used throughout the whole study life-span can improve such communication and potentially lower total study costs. The most relevant standard for representing clinical study data, applicable to unregulated as well as regulated studies, is the Operational Data Model (ODM) in development since 1999 by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). ODM's initial objective was exchange of case report forms data but it is increasingly utilized in other contexts. An ODM extension called Study Design Model, introduced in 2011, provides additional protocol representation elements. Using a case study approach, we evaluated ODM's ability to capture all necessary protocol elements during a complete clinical study lifecycle in the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health. ODM offers the advantage of a single format for institutions that deal with hundreds or thousands of concurrent clinical studies and maintain a data warehouse for these studies. For each study stage, we present a list of gaps in the ODM standard and identify necessary vendor or institutional extensions that can compensate for such gaps. The current version of ODM (1.3.2) has only partial support for study protocol and study registration data mainly because it is outside the original development goal. ODM provides comprehensive support for representation of case report forms (in both the design stage and with patient level data). Inclusion of requirements of observational, non-regulated or investigator-initiated studies (outside Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation) can further improve future revisions of the standard.",

        "Abstract": "The anemia of sickle cell disease is associated with a severe inflammatory vasculopathy and endothelial dysfunction, which leads to painful and life-threatening clinical complications. Growing evidence supports the anti-inflammatory properties of \u03c9-3 fatty acids in clinical models of endothelial dysfunction. Promising but limited studies show potential therapeutic effects of \u03c9-3 fatty acid supplementation in sickle cell disease. Here, we treated humanized healthy and sickle cell mice for 6 weeks with \u03c9-3 fatty acid diet (fish-oil diet). We found that a \u03c9-3 fatty acid diet: (i) normalizes red cell membrane \u03c9-6/\u03c9-3 ratio; (ii) reduces neutrophil count; (iii) decreases endothelial activation by targeting endothelin-1 and (iv) improves left ventricular outflow tract dimensions. In a hypoxia-reoxygenation model of acute vaso-occlusive crisis, a \u03c9-3 fatty acid diet reduced systemic and local inflammation and protected against sickle cell-related end-organ injury. Using isolated aortas from sickle cell mice exposed to hypoxia-reoxygenation, we demonstrated a direct impact of a \u03c9-3 fatty acid diet on vascular activation, inflammation, and anti-oxidant systems. Our data provide the rationale for \u03c9-3 dietary supplementation as a therapeutic intervention to reduce vascular dysfunction in sickle cell disease.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical laboratory results are stored in electronic health records (EHRs) as structured data coded with local or standard terms. However, laboratory tests that are performed at outside laboratories are often simply labeled \"outside test\" or something similar, with the actual test name in a free-text result or comment field. After being aggregated into clinical data repositories, these ambiguous labels impede the retrieval of specific test results. We present a general multi-step solution that can facilitate the identification, standardization, reconciliation, and transformation of such test results. We applied our approach to data in the NIH Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS) to identify laboratory tests, map comment values to the LOINC codes that will be incorporated into our Research Entities Dictionary (RED), and develop a reference table that can be used in the EHR data extract-transform-load (ETL) process.",

We designed in SQL and Java a set of electronic phenotypes that reproduced the study's data sampling, and used R to perform the same statistical inference procedures.

        "Abstract": "We examined a large body of research study documents (protocols) to identify mentions of drug concepts and established base concepts and roles needed to characterize the semantics of these instances. We found these concepts in three general situations: background knowledge about the drug, study procedures involving the drug, and other roles of the drug in the study. We identified 18 more specific contexts (e.g., adverse event information, administration and dosing of the drug, and interactions between the study drug and other drugs). The ontology was validated against a test set of protocol documents from NIH and ClinicalTrial.gov. The goal is to support the automated extraction of drug information from protocol documents to support functions such as study retrieval, determination of subject eligibility, generation of order sets, and creation of logic for decision support alerts and reminders. Further work is needed to formally extend existing ontologies of clinical research.",

        "Abstract": "Personalized medicine, the ability to tailor diagnostic and treatment decisions for individual patients, is seen as the evolution of modern medicine. We characterize here the informatics resources available today or envisioned in the near future that can support clinical interpretation of genomic test results. We assume a clinical sequencing scenario (germline whole-exome sequencing) in which a clinical specialist, such as an endocrinologist, needs to tailor patient management decisions within his or her specialty (targeted findings) but relies on a genetic counselor to interpret off-target incidental findings. We characterize the genomic input data and list various types of knowledge bases that provide genomic knowledge for generating clinical decision support. We highlight the need for patient-level databases with detailed lifelong phenotype content in addition to genotype data and provide a list of recommendations for personalized medicine knowledge bases and databases. We conclude that no single knowledge base can currently support all aspects of personalized recommendations and that consolidation of several current resources into larger, more dynamic and collaborative knowledge bases may offer a future path forward.",

        "Abstract": "Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have spread globally and represent a serious and growing threat to public health. Rapid methods for tracking plasmids carrying carbapenemase genes could greatly benefit infection control efforts. Here, we demonstrate that real-time, direct tracking of a single plasmid in a bacterial strain responsible for an outbreak is possible using a commercial matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system. In this case, we retrospectively tracked the bla(KPC) carbapenemase gene-bearing pKpQIL plasmid responsible for a CRE outbreak that occurred at the NIH Clinical Center in 2011. An \u223c 11,109-Da MS peak corresponding to a gene product of the bla(KPC) pKpQIL plasmid was identified and characterized using a combination of proteomics and molecular techniques. This plasmid peak was present in spectra from retrospectively analyzed K. pneumoniae outbreak isolates, concordant with results from whole-genome sequencing, and absent from a diverse control set of bla(KPC)-negative clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Notably, the gene characterized here is located adjacent to the bla(KPC) Tn4401 transposon on the pKpQIL plasmid. Sequence analysis demonstrates the presence of this gene in other bla(KPC) Tn4401-containing plasmids and suggests that this signature MS peak may be useful in tracking other plasmids conferring carbapenem resistance. Plasmid identification using this MALDI-TOF MS method was accomplished in as little as 10 min from isolated colonies and 30 min from positive (spiked) blood cultures, demonstrating the potential clinical utility for real-time plasmid tracking in an outbreak.",

        "Abstract": "The American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI) sponsors periodic debates during the American Medical Informatics Fall Symposium to highlight important informatics issues of broad interest. In 2012, a panel debated the following topic: \"Resolved: Health Information Exchange Organizations Should Shift Their Principal Focus to Consumer-Mediated Exchange in Order to Facilitate the Rapid Development of Effective, Scalable, and Sustainable Health Information Infrastructure.\" Those supporting the proposition emphasized the need for consumer-controlled community repositories of electronic health records (health record banks) to address privacy, stakeholder cooperation, scalability, and sustainability. Those opposing the proposition emphasized that the current healthcare environment is so complex that development of consumer control will take time and that even then, consumers may not be able to mediate their information effectively. While privately each discussant recognizes that there are many sides to this complex issue, each followed the debater's tradition of taking an extreme position in order emphasize some of the polarizing aspects in the short time allotted them. In preparing this summary, we sought to convey the substance and spirit of the debate in printed form. Transcripts of the actual debate were edited for clarity, and appropriate supporting citations were added for the further edification of the reader.",

We define three high-level classes of underlying data storage models and we analyze each repository using this classification.

While an HL7 standard exists for specifying how the links should be constructed, there is no guidance on what links to construct. Collectively, the authors manage four infobutton systems that serve 16 institutions. The purpose of this paper is to publish our experience with linking various resources and specifying particular criteria that can be used by infobutton managers to select resources that are most relevant for a given situation. This experience can be used directly by those wishing to customize their own EHRs, for example by using the OpenInfobutton infobutton manager and its configuration tool, the Librarian Infobutton Tailoring Environment.",

        "Abstract": "Each year thousands of patients die of avoidable medication errors. When a patient is admitted to, transferred within, or discharged from a clinical facility, clinicians should review previous medication orders, current orders and future plans for care, and reconcile differences if there are any. If medication reconciliation is not accurate and systematic, medication errors such as omissions, duplications, dosing errors, or drug interactions may occur and cause harm. Computer-assisted medication applications showed promise as an intervention to reduce medication summarization inaccuracies and thus avoidable medication errors. In this study, a computer-assisted medication summarization application, designed to abstract and represent multi-source time-oriented medication data, was introduced to assist clinicians with their medication reconciliation processes. An evaluation study was carried out to assess clinical usefulness and analyze potential impact of such application. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were applied to measure clinicians' performance efficiency and inaccuracy in medication summarization process with and without the intervention of computer-assisted medication application. Clinicians' feedback indicated the feasibility of integrating such a medication summarization tool into clinical practice workflow as a complementary addition to existing electronic health record systems. The result of the study showed potential to improve efficiency and reduce inaccuracy in clinician performance of medication summarization, which could in turn improve care efficiency, quality of care, and patient safety.",

However, understanding of the BQM process is limited in the literature. To bridge this gap, we performed the initial steps of a cognitive task analysis using 31 BQM instances conducted between one analyst and 22 researchers in one academic department. We identified five top-level tasks, i.e., clarify research statement, explain clinical process, identify related data elements, locate EHR data element, and end BQM with either a database query or unmet, infeasible information needs, and 10 sub-tasks. We evaluated the BQM task model with seven data analysts from different clinical research institutions. Evaluators found all the tasks completely or semi-valid. This study contributes initial knowledge towards the development of a generalizable cognitive task representation for BQM.",

Electronic health records (EHRs) are necessary to enable the Learning Health System; however, a source of frustration is that current systems fail to adequately support research needs. We propose a model for enhancing EHRs to collect structured and standards-based clinical research data during clinical encounters that promotes efficiency and computational reuse of quality data for both care and research. The model integrates Common Data Elements (CDEs) for clinical research into existing clinical documentation workflows, leveraging executable documentation guidance within the EHR to support coordinated, standardized data collection for both patient care and clinical research.",

We investigated the information needs of emergency medicine clinicians in order to design an electronic dashboard to fill information gaps in the emergency department. An online survey was distributed to all emergency medicine physicians at a large, urban academic medical center. The survey response rate was 48% (52/109). The clinical information items reported to be most helpful while caring for patients in the emergency department were vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) reports, previous discharge summaries, and previous lab results. Brief structured interviews were also conducted with 18 clinicians during their shifts in the emergency department. From the interviews, three themes emerged: 1) difficulty accessing vital signs, 2) difficulty accessing point-of-care tests, and 3) difficulty comparing the current ECG with the previous ECG. An emergency medicine clinical dashboard was developed to address these difficulties.",

        "Abstract": "Clinicians and clinical researchers often seek information in electronic health records (EHRs) that are relevant to some concept of interest, such as a disease or finding. The heterogeneous nature of EHRs can complicate retrieval, risking incomplete results. We frame this problem as the presence of two gaps: 1) a gap between clinical concepts and their representations in EHR data and 2) a gap between data representations and their locations within EHR data structures. We bridge these gaps with a knowledge structure that comprises relationships among clinical concepts (including concepts of interest and concepts that may be instantiated in EHR data) and relationships between clinical concepts and the database structures. We make use of available knowledge resources to develop a reproducible, scalable process for creating a knowledge base that can support automated query expansion from a clinical concept to all relevant EHR data.",

Existing legal framework allows such research under less strict de-identification criteria; however, privacy of non-decedent must be protected. We report on creation of the decease subject Integrated Data Repository (dsIDR) at National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center and a pilot methodology to remove secondary protected health information or identifiable information (secondary PxI; information about persons other than the primary patient). We characterize available structured coded data in dsIDR and report the estimated frequencies of secondary PxI, ranging from 12.9% (sensitive token presence) to 1.1% (using stricter criteria). Federating decedent EHR data from multiple institutions can address sample size limitations and our pilot study provides lessons learned and methodology that can be adopted by other institutions.",

These repositories now need to accommodate data coded with the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM). Database users wish to retrieve relevant data regardless of the system by which they are coded. We demonstrate how a terminology repository (the Research Entities Dictionary or RED) serves as an ontology relating terms of both ICD versions to each other to support seamless version-independent retrieval from the Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS) at the National Institutes of Health. We make use of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' General Equivalence Mappings (GEMs) to reduce the modeling effort required to determine whether ICD-10-CM terms should be added to the RED as new concepts or as synonyms of existing concepts. A divide-and-conquer approach is used to develop integration heuristics that offer a satisfactory interim solution and facilitate additional refinement of the integration as time and resources allow.",

Second, we use whole genome sequencing (WGS) data instead of genotyping arrays to obtain patients' genetic profiles.

At the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Lifelines2, a visualization program from the University of Maryland's Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory, was recently integrated into the NIH's clinical repository, the Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS). To explore the functionality of Lifelines2, two markers of inflammation - erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) - were compared on patients both with and without the rare immune disorder chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) using ten years of de-identified patient data. We used Lifelines2 to visualize correlations among 12,266 laboratory events on 622 patients. The findings from our unrestricted sample identify areas warranting further studies on population subsets in which clinical features (such as disease activity) are known. Overall, visual aids such as Lifelines2 allowed for both rapid and powerful interpretation of EHR data.",

However, this approach does not scale up and is time-consuming and expensive. We analyzed query mediation dialogues to inform future designs of intelligent query mediation systems. Thirty-one mediated query sessions for 22 research projects were recorded and transcribed. We analyzed 10 of these to develop an annotation schema for dialogue acts through iterative refinement. Three coders independently annotated all 3160 dialogue acts. We assessed the inter-rater agreement and resolved disagreement by group consensus. This study contributes early knowledge of the query negotiation space for medical research. We conclude that research data query formulation is not a straightforward translation from researcher data needs to database queries, but rather iterative, process-oriented needs assessment and refinement.",

This paper describes OpenInfobutton (www.openinfobutton.org): a standards-based, open source Web service that was designed to disseminate infobutton capabilities in multiple EHR systems and healthcare organizations. OpenInfobutton has been successfully integrated with 38 knowledge resources at 5 large healthcare organizations in the United States. We describe the OpenInfobutton architecture, knowledge resource integration, and experiences at five large healthcare organizations.",

A new de-identified data query tool under development has been developed to support re-use of these data. We used a collection of 30 human-mediated user queries to determine whether features of the tool will be sufficient to allow users to carry out the queries themselves. The results show that the tool implemented in February 2013 will carry out a small percentage of user queries but the planned extensions will be sufficient for carrying out the majority of such queries. Future development of the tool will include extensions that correspond to the features found in human-mediated queries.",

However, there are many caveats to the use of such data. Electronic health record data from clinical settings may be inaccurate, incomplete, transformed in ways that undermine their meaning, unrecoverable for research, of unknown provenance, of insufficient granularity, and incompatible with research protocols. However, the quantity and real-world nature of these data provide impetus for their use, and we develop a list of caveats to inform would-be users of such data as well as provide an informatics roadmap that aims to insure this opportunity to augment comparative effectiveness research can be best leveraged.",

Clinical trial registries were established to increase transparency in completed and ongoing clinical trials, and they support linking trials with resulting publications. We set out to investigate precision and negative predictive value (NPV) of links between ClinicalTrials.gov (CT.gov) and PubMed. CT.gov has been established to increase transparency in clinical trials and the link to PubMed is crucial for supporting a number of important functions, including ascertaining publication bias. We drew a random sample of trials downloaded from CT.gov and performed manual review of retrieved publications. We characterize two types of links between trials and publications (NCT-link originating from MEDLINE and PMID-link originating from CT.gov).The link precision is different based on type (NCT-link: 100%; PMID-link: 63% to 96%). In trials with no linked publication, we were able to find publications 44% of the time (NPV=56%) by searching PubMed. This low NPV shows that there are potentially numerous publications that should have been formally linked with the trials. Our results indicate that existing trial registry and publisher policies may not be fully enforced. We suggest some automated methods for improving link quality.",

        "Abstract": "Infobuttons are clinical decision support tools that use information about the clinical context (institution, user, patient) in which an information need arises to provide direct access to relevant information from knowledge resources. Two freely available resources make infobutton implementation possible for virtually any EHR system. OpenInfobutton is an HL7-compliant system that accepts context parameters from an EHR and, using its knowledge base of resources and information needs, generates a set of links that direct the user to relevant information. The Librarian Infobutton Tailoring Environment (LITE) is a second system that allows institutional librarians to specify which resources should be selected in a given context by OpenInfobutton. This paper describes the steps needed to use LITE to customize OpenInfobutton and to integrate OpenInfobutton into an EHR.",

        "Abstract": "There is an increasing amount of clinical data in operational electronic health record (EHR) systems. Such data provide substantial opportunities for their re-use for many purposes, including comparative effectiveness research (CER). In a previous paper, we identified a number of caveats related to the use of such data, noting that they may be inaccurate, incomplete, transformed in ways that undermine their meaning, unrecoverable for research, of unknown provenance, of insufficient granularity, or incompatible with research protocols. In this paper, we provide recommendations for overcoming these caveats with the goal of leveraging such data to benefit CER and other health care activities. These recommendations include adaptation of \"best evidence\" approaches to use of data; processes to evaluate availability, completeness, quality, and transformability of data; creation of tools to manage data and their attributes; determination of metrics for assessing whether data are \"research grade\"; development of methods for comparative validation of data; construction of a methodology database for methods involving use of clinical data; standardized reporting methods for data and their attributes; appropriate use of informatics expertise; and a research agenda to determine biases inherent in operational data and to assess informatics approaches to their improvement.",

        "Abstract": "Point-of-care information needs are common and frequently unmet. One solution to this problem is the use of Infobuttons, which are context-sensitive links from electronic health records (EHR) to knowledge resources, sometimes involving an intermediate broker known as an Infobutton Manager. Health Level Seven (HL7) has developed the Context-Aware Knowledge Retrieval (Infobutton) standard to standardize the integration between EHR systems and knowledge resources. While the standard specifies a set of context attributes and standard terminologies, it leaves to knowledge resources the flexibility to decide how to use these attributes and terminologies to retrieve the most relevant content. This paper describes some of the challenges faced by knowledge resources in trying to locate the most relevant content based on the attribute values for a given Infobutton request. Various approaches to content retrieval are discussed, including the role of indexing with standardized codes, the role of text-based search engines together with their ranking algorithms, and the role of hybrid approaches. Knowledge resource developers must carefully consider business rules, heuristics, and precision/recall tradeoffs when implementing the HL7 Infobutton standard.",

        "Abstract": "Auditing healthcare terminologies for errors requires human experts. In this paper, we present a study of the performance of auditors looking for errors in the semantic type assignments of complex UMLS concepts. In this study, concepts are considered complex whenever they are assigned combinations of semantic types. Past research has shown that complex concepts have a higher likelihood of errors. The results of this study indicate that individual auditors are not reliable when auditing such concepts and their performance is low, according to various metrics. These results confirm the outcomes of an earlier pilot study. They imply that to achieve an acceptable level of reliability and performance, when auditing such concepts of the UMLS, several auditors need to be assigned the same task. A mechanism is then needed to combine the possibly differing opinions of the different auditors into a final determination. In the current study, in contrast to our previous work, we used a majority mechanism for this purpose. For a sample of 232 complex UMLS concepts, the majority opinion was found reliable and its performance for accuracy, recall, precision and the F-measure was found statistically significantly higher than the average performance of individual auditors.",

        "Abstract": "Spoken question answering for clinical decision support is a potentially revolutionary technology for improving the efficiency and quality of health care delivery. This application involves many technologies currently being researched, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), information retrieval (IR), and summarization, all in the biomedical domain. In certain domains, the problem of spoken document retrieval has been declared solved because of the robustness of IR to ASR errors. This study investigates the extent to which spoken medical question answering benefits from that same robustness. We used the best results from previous speech recognition experiments as inputs to a clinical question answering system, and had physicians perform blind evaluations of results generated both by ASR transcripts of questions and gold standard transcripts of the same questions. Our results suggest that the medical domain differs enough from the open domain to require additional work in automatic speech recognition adapted for the biomedical domain.",

        "Abstract": "An important barrier to the widespread dissemination of clinical decision support (CDS) is the heterogeneity of information models and terminologies used across healthcare institutions, health information systems, and CDS resources such as knowledge bases. To address this problem, the Health Level 7 (HL7) Virtual Medical Record project (an open, international standards development effort) is developing community consensus on the clinical information exchanged between CDS engines and clinical information systems. As a part of this effort, the HL7 CDS Work Group embarked on a multinational, collaborative effort to identify a representative set of clinical data elements required for CDS. Based on an analysis of CDS systems from 20 institutions representing 4 nations, 131 data elements were identified as being currently utilized for CDS. These findings will inform the development of the emerging HL7 Virtual Medical Record standard and will facilitate the achievement of scalable, standards-based CDS.",

        "Abstract": "Most existing controlled terminologies can be characterized as collections of terms, wherein the terms are arranged in a simple list or organized in a hierarchy. These kinds of terminologies are considered useful for standardizing terms and encoding data and are currently used in many existing information systems. However, they suffer from a number of limitations that make data reuse difficult. Relatively recently, it has been proposed that formal ontological methods can be applied to some of the problems of terminological design. Biomedical ontologies organize concepts (embodiments of knowledge about biomedical reality) whereas terminologies organize terms (what is used to code patient data at a certain point in time, based on the particular terminology version). However, the application of these methods to existing terminologies is not straightforward. The use of these terminologies is firmly entrenched in many systems, and what might seem to be a simple option of replacing these terminologies is not possible. Moreover, these terminologies evolve over time in order to suit the needs of users. Any methodology must therefore take these constraints into consideration, hence the need for formal methods of managing changes. Along these lines, we have developed a formal representation of the concept-term relation, around which we have also developed a methodology for management of terminology changes. The objective of this study was to determine whether our methodology would result in improved retrieval of data.",

Unique aspects of the system includes a Research Entities Dictionary that unifies all controlled terminologies used by source systems and a hybrid data model that unifies parts of the source data models and include other data in entity-attribute value tables. BTRIS currently includes over 300 million rows of data, from three institutes, ranging from 1976 to present.

        "Abstract": "Biological ontologies are now being widely used for annotation, sharing and retrieval of the biological data. Many of these ontologies are hosted under the umbrella of the Open Biological Ontologies Foundry. In order to support interterminology mapping, composite terms in these ontologies need to be translated into atomic or primitive terms in other, orthogonal ontologies, for example, gluconeogenesis (biological process term) to glucose (chemical ontology term). Identifying such decompositional ontology translations is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a network-theoretic approach based on the structure of the integrated OBO relationship graph. We use a network-theoretic measure, called the clustering coefficient, to find relevant atomic terms in the neighborhood of a composite term. By eliminating the existing GO to ChEBI Ontology mappings from OBO, we evaluate whether the proposed approach can re-identify the corresponding relationships. The results indicate that the network structure provides strong cues for decompositional ontology translation and the existing relationships can be used to identify new translations.",

        "Abstract": "CONTEXT Telemedicine is a promising but largely unproven technology for providing case management services to patients with chronic conditions and lower access to care. OBJECTIVES To examine the effectiveness of a telemedicine intervention to achieve clinical management goals in older, ethnically diverse, medically underserved patients with diabetes. DESIGN, Setting, and Patients A randomized controlled trial was conducted, comparing telemedicine case management to usual care, with blinded outcome evaluation, in 1,665 Medicare recipients with diabetes, aged >/= 55 years, residing in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York State. Interventions Home telemedicine unit with nurse case management versus usual care. Main Outcome Measures The primary endpoints assessed over 5 years of follow-up were hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and blood pressure levels. RESULTS Intention-to-treat mixed models showed that telemedicine achieved net overall reductions over five years of follow-up in the primary endpoints (HgbA1c, p = 0.001; LDL, p < 0.001; systolic and diastolic blood pressure, p = 0.024; p < 0.001). Estimated differences (95% CI) in year 5 were 0.29 (0.12, 0.46)% for HgbA1c, 3.84 (-0.08, 7.77) mg/dL for LDL cholesterol, and 4.32 (1.93, 6.72) mm Hg for systolic and 2.64 (1.53, 3.74) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure. There were 176 deaths in the intervention group and 169 in the usual care group (hazard ratio 1.01 [0.82, 1.24]). CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine case management resulted in net improvements in HgbA1c, LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure levels over 5 years in medically underserved Medicare beneficiaries.

        "Abstract": "The objective of this evaluation was to determine the effect of redesigning the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) telemedicine architecture on the average upload delay and on the average number of glucose uploads to a central database. These two measures positively influence our ability to deliver timely and accurate patient care to the study population. The redesign was also undertaken to improve the patients' experience in using the system and thereby increase the frequency and timeliness of their self-monitoring behavior. Using the total number of glucose uploads, we compared the delay in glucose upload times according to the type of home telemedicine unit the study participants used and the region where the participants lived. The participants were Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes living in medically underserved neighborhoods in New York City and rural Upstate New York. The populations in these two regions differed considerably in terms of ethnicity, language spoken (Spanish, English), and education level. Participants who had Generation 2 (Gen 2) (mean = 10.75, SD +/- 7.96) home telemedicine units had significantly shorter upload delay times (p < 0.001) as measured in days than those participants with Generation 1 (Gen 1) (mean = 22.44, SD +/- 11.18) and those who were upgraded from Gen 1 (mean = 20.67, SD +/- 8.85) to Gen 2 (mean = 14.93, SD +/- 9.37). Additionally, the delay was significantly shorter for participants living upstate (mean = 24.14 days, SD +/- 11.95 days) than downstate (mean = 15.30 days, SD +/- 7.87 days), t (975) = 13.98, p < 0.01. The system redesign made a significant impact in reducing glucose upload delays of IDEATel participants. However, upload delays were significantly impacted by the region where the participants resided.",

        "Abstract": "Home telemedicine is an emerging healthcare paradigm that has the potential to transform the treatment of chronic illness. The purpose of this paper is to: (1) develop a theoretical and methodological framework for studying workflow in telemediated clinician-patient encounters drawing on a distributed cognition approach and (2) employ the framework in an in-depth analysis of workflow in the IDEATel project, a telemedicine program for older adults with diabetes. The methods employed in this research included (a) videotaped observations of 27 nurse-patient encounters and (b) semi-structured interviews with participants. The analyses were used to provide a descriptive analysis of video visits, understand the mediating role of different technologies and to characterize the ways in which artifacts and representations are used to understand the state of the patient. The study revealed barriers to productive use of telehealth technology as well as adaptations that circumvented such limitations. This research has design implications for: (a) improving the coordination of communication and (b) developing tools that better integrate and display information. Although home telemedicine programs will differ in important respects, there are invariant properties across such systems. Explicating these properties can serve as a needs requirement analysis to develop more effective systems and implementation plans.",

        "Abstract": "Although controlled biomedical terminologies have been with us for centuries, it is only in the last couple of decades that close attention has been paid to the quality of these terminologies. The result of this attention has been the development of auditing methods that apply formal methods to assessing whether terminologies are complete and accurate. We have performed an extensive literature review to identify published descriptions of these methods and have created a framework for characterizing them. The framework considers manual, systematic and heuristic methods that use knowledge (within or external to the terminology) to measure quality factors of different aspects of the terminology content (terms, semantic classification, and semantic relationships). The quality factors examined included concept orientation, consistency, non-redundancy, soundness and comprehensive coverage. We reviewed 130 studies that were retrieved based on keyword search on publications in PubMed, and present our assessment of how they fit into our framework. We also identify which terminologies have been audited with the methods and provide examples to illustrate each part of the framework.",

        "Abstract": "The Medical Entities Dictionary (MED) has served as a unified terminology at New York Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University for more than 20 years. It was initially created to allow the clinical data from the disparate information systems (e.g., radiology, pharmacy, and multiple laboratories, etc.) to be uniquely codified for storage in a single data repository, and functions as a real time terminology server for clinical applications and decision support tools. Being conceived as a knowledge base, the MED incorporates relationships among local terms, between local terms and external standards, and additional knowledge about terms in a semantic network structure. Over the past two decades, we have sought to develop methods to maintain, audit and improve the content of the MED, such that it remains true to its original design goals. This has resulted in a complex, multi-faceted process, with both manual and automated components. In this paper, we describe this process, with examples of its effectiveness. We believe that our process provides lessons for others who seek to maintain complex, concept-oriented controlled terminologies.",

A key part of the caBIG architecture is the establishment of terminology standards for representing data. In order to evaluate the suitability of existing controlled terminologies, the caBIG Vocabulary and Data Elements Workspace (VCDE WS) working group has developed a set of criteria that serve to assess a terminology's structure, content, documentation, and editorial process. This paper describes the evolution of these criteria and the results of their use in evaluating four standard terminologies: the Gene Ontology (GO), the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt), the Common Terminology for Adverse Events (known as CTCAE), and the laboratory portion of the Logical Objects, Identifiers, Names and Codes (LOINC). The resulting caBIG criteria are presented as a matrix that may be applicable to any terminology standardization effort.",

        "Abstract": "Data errors in electronic health records have been shown to have the potential to adversely impact the conclusions drawn from clinical research. We prospectively studied the efficacy of a new alert to infer errors in previously stored data and to decrease the frequency of data entry errors, in an attempt to improve the quality of data for clinical trials. For the purpose of this study, we monitored data entry errors in height or weight measurements. We predetermined the criteria for probable error as a ten percent variance from a patient's reference value. The care provider entering a value satisfying our error criteria received a disruptive pop-up alert message. The study revealed a significant decrease in the frequency of data errors stored in the EHR, from 2.4% before the alert to 0.9% after the alert. These findings have implications for the development of clinical research trial data collection support tools.",

        "Abstract": "The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) integrates knowledge from several biomedical terminologies. One of the important sources of knowledge is the set of semantic relationships asserted between the concepts derived from different source terminologies. Such integration of multiple sources of terminological knowledge can potentially enable discovery of implicit meaningful relationships between the concepts (unrelated at a given time). In this research we explore whether the existing knowledge in the UMLS in the form of semantics (types or categories) and structure (network topology) can be used to discover potential relationships. In this paper, we propose a problem-independent approach to discover potential terminological relationships by semantic abstraction of transitive relationship paths to perform classification and analyzing network theoretic measures such as topological overlap and average number of transitive paths. Using different versions of the UMLS, we evaluate the proposed approach over newly added relationships. Strong discriminative characteristics were observed with semantic abstraction based classifier (area under curve of 0.96) and average number of transitive paths (t[198]=\u22124.19, p<0.001) to identify potential relationships. The UMLS has sufficient knowledge to enable discovery of potential terminological relationships.",

        "Abstract": "Nurses information needs relate to nursing orders and nursing orders have many contexts including body systems, safety practices and other clinical categories. When searching for information related to orders one search term might retrieve documents related to multiple orders. We clustered nursing orders into sets that are related by the same logical clinical context. We then generated clusters and their search terms from a data set of 636 orders obtained from a CIS/CPOE system at an academic medical center. We refined those cluster search terms by searching an electronic nursing procedure manual to retrieve resources that could answer one of six generic nursing questions. Sixty-three cluster search terms were identified. The search terms for 100 (16%) of the orders were validated in a second hospitals electronic nursing procedure manual; precision was 32.5%.. Our process of identifying cluster search terms may be a useful method to obtain clinically relevant information resources.",

        "Abstract": "Online knowledge resources are generally underused despite their potentially beneficial effect on patient care. We are interested in ways to increase use of context-specific links, called infobuttons, from clinical information systems to such resources. We used log files to examine the impact of classroom instruction on infobutton use to pinpoint a particular context where infobuttons appeared to be underused by particular users. We sent users e-mail suggestions about infobuttons and reviewed log files to examine the impact of the messages. Log files showed that usage by medical students and housestaff following classroom instruction was initially high but then tapered off. In particular, we found that infobuttons were infrequently used in an outpatient, but not inpatient, medication application. We sent 552 suggestion e-mails to 371 users after log files showed that they used other resources in that context. Fifty-two of these users used infobuttons within 31 days of receiving the e-mail, which represents 25.9% of recipients who used any resource during the same period. Users responded best when the e-mail was sent within 5 days of using the resource. Traditional instruction had a limited sustained effect on improving the use of infobuttons. An automated method for sending targeted suggestions complemented the traditional approach.",

Infobuttons have been around for over 15 years but are only recently finding wide-spread adoption, with various \"infobutton managers\", and infobutton-like projects being developed at several academic medical centers. Vendors of electronic health records systems have begun working with vendors of knowledge resources to create \"infobutton access\" methods for communicating from the former to the latter. In response to this increased interest, and the attendant need to standardize communication between clinical systems and infobutton managers and between infobutton managers and knowledge resources, Health Level 7 (HL7) is developing a standard message structure for exchange contextual information and information-needs requests. At least one project is underway to develop a tailoring environment that can be used by health librarians to customize infobutton managers for use at their own institutions, with their own users, and their preferred knowledge resources.",

The Infobutton Manager (IM), accessed through a clinical information system, anticipates the clinician's questions and provides links to pertinent electronic resources. We conducted an observational usefulness case study of medical residents (MDs), nurse practitioners (NPs), registered nurses (RNs), and a physician assistant (PA), using the IM in a laboratory setting. Generic question types and success rates for each clinician's information needs were characterized. Question type frequency differed by clinician type. All clinician types asked for institution-specific protocols. The MDs asked about unfamiliar domains, RNs asked about physician order rationales, and NPs asked questions similar to both MDs and RNs. Observational data suggest that IM success rates may be improved by tailoring anticipated questions to clinician type. Clinicians reported that a more visible Infobutton may increase use.",

Along these lines, we have developed a formal representation of the concept-term relationship, around which we have also developed a methodology for management of terminology changes. We have implemented our methodology in a terminology maintenance tool. To evaluate our methodology, we compared two methods for retrieving ICD-9-CM data, based on their recall when retrieving data for ICD-9-CM terms whose codes had changed but which had retained their original meaning. Our results show that recall is either the same or better with a retrieval method that takes into account the effects of terminology. Statistically significant differences were detected (p<0.05) with the McNemar test for two terms whose codes had changed. Furthermore, when all the cases are combined in an overall category, our method 2 also performs statistically significantly better than default method 1 (p < 0.05).",

        "Abstract": "Biomedical terminologies often contain composite concepts that cannot be translated into single unique synonymous concepts in a target controlled terminology. Such composite concepts need to be decomposed into sets of component concepts present in the target terminology that can serve as the proxy for applications in information retrieval, decision support or data analysis. Towards this goal, we use a \"clustering coefficient\" over the UMLS Metathesaurus to traverse the closely clustered neighbors of the composite source concept to generate a ranked list of possible component concepts. Using the MeSH Associated Expression mappings as the gold-standard, we show that the proposed approach generates relevant component concepts as compared to existing semantic locality based methods. The topological connectivity of the concepts in the UMLS Metathesaurus is a useful feature that can be coupled with existing lexical and semantic locality based approaches towards terminology translation.",

The resources range from local documents, to commercially available document sets and search engines. The links provided by the IM can be reliably created, but there is no guarantee that they will function reliably, since the resources to which they point are subject to unannounced changes and failures. We have developed a set of tools to audit the links periodically to determine if the resources are available and if the IM has sufficient information to generate all the links needed by its users. These tools have been in use since February, 2006 and have provided timely warnings on many occasions. These warnings have allowed us to correct problems with resource access before they became apparent to our users and often before the resource maintainers were aware of the problems. The tools have thus helped us provide clinicians with a dependable level of service.",

        "Abstract": "The UMLS contains more than 100 source vocabularies and is growing via the integration of others. When integrating a new source, the source terms already in the UMLS must first be found. The easiest approach to this is simple string matching. However, string matching usually does not find all concepts that should be found. A new methodology, based on the notion of piecewise synonyms, for enhancing the process of concept discovery in the UMLS is presented. This methodology is supported by first creating a general synonym dictionary based on the UMLS. Each multi-word source term is decomposed into its component words, allowing for the generation of separate synonyms for each word from the general synonym dictionary. The recombination of these synonyms into new terms creates an expanded pool of matching candidates for terms from the source. The methodology is demonstrated with respect to an existing UMLS source. It shows a 34% improvement over simple string matching.",

        "Abstract": "The UMLS is a terminological system that integrates many source terminologies. Each concept in the UMLS is assigned one or more semantic types from the Semantic Network, an upper level ontology for biomedicine. Due to the complexity of the UMLS, errors exist in the semantic type assignments. Finding assignment errors may unearth modeling errors. Even with sophisticated tools, discovering assignment errors requires manual review. In this paper we describe the evaluation of an auditing project of UMLS semantic type assignments. We studied the performance of the auditors who reviewed potential errors. We found that four auditors, interacting according to a multi-step protocol, identified a high rate of errors (one or more errors in 81% of concepts studied) and that results were sufficiently reliable (0.67 to 0.70) for the two most common types of errors. However, reliability was low for each individual auditor, suggesting that review of potential errors is resource-intensive.",

        "Abstract": "Nurse information needs at the point of care exist; however, once provided with access to resources, nurses seek evidence-based answers. The success of answering an information need through an automated Infobutton relies on the program's ability to anticipate a clinician's question. This study's six process methodology aims to meet context-specific information needs related to clinical information system (CIS) nursing orders. Context-specific questions were derived from nurse generic questions generated from nurse focus group data, observational data, and an established taxonomy. The context-specific questions, were filtered by nursing order semantic type within a logical clinical context cluster (LCCC), which is a clinical association identified from the nurse perspective. Nursing orders of the same semantic type are associated with similar types of nurse information needs and are used to assess Internet-based resources for the capability to answer those information needs. LCCCs help identify resources and CIS areas ripe for an Infobutton.",

My research characterizes these needs in order to build information systems that can help clinicians get timely answers to their questions. My colleagues and I have developed \"Infobuttons\", which are links between clinical information systems and on-line knowledge resources, and have developed an \"Infobutton Manager\" (IM) that attempts to determine the information need based on the context of what the user is doing. The IM presents users with a set of questions, each of which is a link to an online information resource that will answer the question. The Infobutton Manager has been successfully deployed in five systems at four institutions and provides users with over 1,000 accesses to on-line health information each month, with a positive impact on patient care.",

        "Abstract": "Despite public health initiatives targeting rapid action in response to symptoms of myocardial infarction (MI), people continue to delay in going to a hospital when experiencing these symptoms due to lack of recognition as cardiac-related. The objective of this research was to characterize lay individuals' knowledge of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and associated decision processes for timely action. Thirty participants were interviewed about their knowledge of AMI, then presented with unrelated, unfamiliar and familiar scenarios of AMI symptoms and instructed to \"think aloud\" as they made decisions in response to the scenarios in order to capture the decision process directly. Data were analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods to identify the semantic relationships between knowledge and decisions. Results showed that most participants (80%) identified three symptoms or less (e.g., chest pain: 93%; dyspnea: 53%). All participants identified urgent actions (calling 911, going to ED) as the appropriate response to AMI symptoms. Urgent action decisions increased with familiarity of symptoms (57% for unrelated symptoms to 83% for most familiar symptoms), and was highest for the cardiac group. Lay knowledge of AMI is necessary, but not sufficient for people to develop required heuristics for timely action. This ineffective decision increases as a function of ambiguous and unfamiliar situations. Health education interventions should focus on teaching clusters of problems with varying levels of familiarity and complexity to increase flexibility in making decisions.",

        "Abstract": "Interest in studying distractions and interruptions in the context of clinician workflow has increased in light of evidence that these events may negatively impact patient safety. Additionally, many recent informatics-based studies analyze computer provider order entry (CPOE) and clinical information system (CIS) implementation and its effects on clinician workflow. This study expands the development and use of a taxonomy to characterize distractions to clinicians and their subsequent actions in the context of CPOE/CIS use. We found a total of 75 distracting events in 406 minutes of observational data of which 32 led to interruptions and 30 led to continued multitasking. The above primary actions led to 5 tasks not completed and 4 episodes of clinician's lack of recall. Differences in the distribution of the source of distractions and primary action of the distracted clinicians may be a function of clinical setting and clinician type using the CPOE/CIS. Nine secondary actions, potentially resulting in a slip or a mistake, suggest that CPOE may necessitate different forms of safety nets than traditional clinician communication.",

        "Abstract": "The UMLS Metathesaurus belongs to the class of scale-free networks with few concept hubs possessing a large number of relationships. The hubs provide useful links between the concepts from disparate terminologies in the UMLS; however, they also exponentially increase the number of possible transitive cross-terminology paths. Towards the goal of using machine learning to rank cross-terminology translations, we propose a traversal algorithm that exploits the scale-free property of the UMLS to reduce the number of candidate translations. We characterize the concept hubs into \"informational\" and \"noisy\" concept hubs and provide an automated method to detect them. Using gold standard mappings from SNOMED-CT to ICD9CM, we found an average 20-fold reduction in the number of candidate mappings while achieving comparable recall and ranking results. A hub-driven traversal strategy provides a promising approach to generate high quality cross-terminology translations from the UMLS.",

We have developed a method in which medication information (consisting of both coded data and narrative text) is extracted from twelve sources from two clinical information systems and assembled into a chronological sequence of medication history, plans, and orders that correspond to periods before, during and after a hospital admission. We use natural language processing, a controlled terminology, and a medication classification system to create matrices that can be used to determine the initiation, changes and discontinuation of medications over time. We applied the process to a set of 17 patient records and successfully abstracted and summarized the medication data. This approach has implications for efforts to improve medication history-taking, order entry, and automated auditing of patient records for quality assurance.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the importance and complexity of evaluating decision-making capacity at the end of life, little research has focused on terminally ill patients' decision-making ability. The purpose of this study was to explore the decision-making capacity of elderly, terminally ill patients and the psychological and physical factors that affect decision making. Decision-making capacity and cognitive abilities were assessed using four measures: the Hopkins Competency Assessment Kit, the Bechara Gambling Task, the Concept Assessment Kit, and the Mini Mental Status Exam. In addition, symptoms of depression, level of physical functioning, and extent of physical symptoms were evaluated in order to identify correlates of decision-making ability. Two samples were compared: elderly, terminally ill patients with cancer (n = 43) and elderly, physically healthy adults living in supportive community residence (n = 35). Results revealed significantly poorer decision-making abilities among the terminal ill sample compared with healthy comparisons, but no association between demographic variables (e.g., age, race, or education) or clinical variables (depression or physical symptoms) and decision making. Implications for evaluating decision-making capacity are addressed.",

        "Abstract": "The published medical literature and online medical resources are important sources to help physicians make patient treatment decisions. Traditional sources used for information retrieval (e.g., PubMed) often return a list of documents in response to a user's query. Frequently the number of returned documents from large knowledge repositories is large and makes information seeking practical only \"after hours\" and not in the clinical setting. This study developed novel algorithms, and designed, implemented, and evaluated a medical definitional question answering system (MedQA). MedQA automatically analyzed a large number of electronic documents to generate short and coherent answers in response to definitional questions (i.e., questions with the format of \"What is X?\"). Our preliminary cognitive evaluation shows that MedQA out-performed three other online information systems (Google, OneLook, and PubMed) in two important efficiency criteria; namely, time spent and number of actions taken for a physician to identify a definition. It is our contention that question answering systems that aggregate pertinent information scattered across different documents have the potential to address clinical information needs within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of clinicians.",

Information retrieval systems (e.g., PubMed) typically return a list of documents in response to a user's query. Frequently the number of returned documents is large and makes physicians' information seeking \"practical only 'after hours' and not in the clinical settings\". Question answering techniques are based on automatically analyzing thousands of electronic documents to generate short-text answers in response to clinical questions that are posed by physicians. The authors address physicians' information needs and described the design, implementation, and evaluation of the medical question answering system (MedQA). Although our long term goal is to enable MedQA to answer all types of medical questions, currently, we implemented MedQA to integrate information retrieval, extraction, and summarization techniques to automatically generate paragraph-level text for definitional questions (i.e., \"What is X?\").

        "Abstract": "SNOMED-CT has been promoted as a reference terminology for electronic health record (EHR) systems. Many important EHR functions are based on the assumption that medical concepts will be coded consistently by different users. This study is designed to measure agreement among three physicians using two SNOMED-CT terminology browsers to encode 242 concepts from five ophthalmology case presentations in a publicly-available clinical journal. Inter-coder reliability, based on exact coding match by each physician, was 44% using one browser and 53% using the other. Intra-coder reliability testing revealed that a different SNOMED-CT code was obtained up to 55% of the time when the two browsers were used by one user to encode the same concept. These results suggest that the reliability of SNOMED-CT coding is imperfect, and may be a function of browsing methodology. A combination of physician training, terminology refinement, and browser improvement may help increase the reproducibility of SNOMED-CT coding.",

        "Abstract": "Information needs studies in clinical settings often face the problem of integrating and analyzing data collected using different study tools. Generally, a coding taxonomy or a model is developed to capture and code the study data. Significant efforts are required to develop a model that not only captures the study data but is also closer to the clinical domain to draw meaningful real world inferences. Further, a study-specific model limits comparative evaluation of studies across different institutions. In this paper, we propose a reference model for representing nursing information needs. We use an iterative and collaborative approach in representing the concepts in the model. The model consists of 33 information (need) concepts, 29 information sources and 7 categories of nursing tasks which were used to code 228 identified information need instances.",

        "Abstract": "Many studies have found that clinicians require access to medical knowledge sources while viewing data in their patients' health records. To address this need, we have been developing links to various on-line health information resources from our Web-based clinical information system (WebCIS). Clinicians can access these resources through a \"Health Resources\" Web page or use context-sensitive \"infobuttons\" that automatically link to specific resources. To assist in understanding how clinicians interact with these two mechanisms, we have been exploring the use of an automated approach to answer questions about usage for guiding the further development of links to resources. In this paper, we discuss the use of a knowledge discovery technique (CIS Usage Mining) to obtain usage statistics from log files that record interactions with health resources and infobuttons in WebCIS, describe a Web-based interface developed to present the results, and summarize how the results could be applied. The availability of effective links to on-line medical knowledge sources from the patient health record can assist in resolving information needs, potentially improving patient care and decision-making.",

The following study employed usability engineering methods via a series of focus groups, to specify functional and design requirements for an automated Fall-Injury Risk Assessment Instrument. Focus groups were held with interdisciplinary decision makers and end-users to identify functional and design specifications for the automated instrument. The results were mapped to usability heuristics, which were used to guide design decisions. The main elements identified were data completeness, workflow processes, resource access, and cognitive burden. The main usability factors identified were efficiency of user, match with real world, error prevention, recognition not recall and minimalist design. Focus groups are a useful methodology to specify requirements for healthcare applications. Outcomes evaluation of the automated instrument is in process.",

Among the Desiderata was a call for terminologies to be \"concept oriented.\" Since then, research has trended toward the extension of terminologies into ontologies. A paper by Smith, entitled \"From Concepts to Clinical Reality: An Essay on the Benchmarking of Biomedical Terminologies\" urges a realist approach that seeks terminologies composed of universals, rather than concepts. The current paper addresses issues raised by Smith and attempts to extend the Desiderata, not away from concepts, but towards recognition that concepts and universals must both be embraced and can coexist peaceably in controlled terminologies. To that end, additional Desiderata are defined that deal with the purpose, rather than the structure, of controlled medical terminologies.",

The traditional manual method of developing terminology models is time-consuming and limited in the number of phrases that a human developer can examine. In this paper, we present an automated method for developing medical terminology models based on natural language processing (NLP) and information visualization techniques. Surgical pathology reports were selected as the testing corpus for developing a pathology procedure terminology model. The use of a general NLP processor for the medical domain, MedLEE, provides an automated method for acquiring semantic structures from a free text corpus and sheds light on a new high-throughput method of medical terminology model development. The use of an information visualization technique supports the summarization and visualization of the large quantity of semantic structures generated from medical documents. We believe that a general method based on NLP and information visualization will facilitate the modeling of medical terminologies.",

It is essential to actively seek to produce good user interfaces that are acceptable to the user. This paper describes the methodology used to develop a simplified heuristic evaluation (HE) suitable for the evaluation of screen shots of Web pages, the development of an HE instrument used to conduct the evaluation, and the results of the evaluation of the aforementioned screen shots. In addition, this paper presents examples of the process of categorizing problems identified by the HE and the technological solutions identified to resolve these problems. Four usability experts reviewed 18 paper-based screen shots and made a total of 108 comments. Each expert completed the task in about an hour. We were able to implement solutions to approximately 70% of the violations. Our study found that a heuristic evaluation using paper-based screen shots of a user interface was expeditious, inexpensive, and straightforward to implement.",

Two studies were conducted to examine the participants' perceptions of both the short-term (spring 2002) and the long-term influences (1993 through 2002) on knowledge, skills, and behavior. Data were collected through the use of questionnaires, semistructured telephone interviews, and participant observation methods to provide both quantitative and qualitative assessment. The participants of the spring 2002 course considered the course to be an excellent opportunity to increase their knowledge and understanding of the field of medical informatics as well as to meet and interact with other professionals in the field to establish future collaborations. Past participants remained highly satisfied with their experience at Woods Hole and its influence on their professional careers and their involvement in a broad range of activities related to medical informatics. This group considered their knowledge and understanding of medical informatics to be of greater quality, had increased their networking with other professionals, and were more confident and motivated to work in the field. Many of the participants feel and show evidence of becoming effective agents of change in their institutions in the area of medical informatics, which is one of the objectives of the program.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the plethora of research linking spirituality, religiosity and psychological well-being among people living with medical illnesses, the role of afterlife beliefs on psychological functioning has been virtually ignored. The present investigation assessed afterlife beliefs, spiritual well-being and psychological functioning at the end of life among 276 terminally ill cancer patients. Results indicated that belief in an afterlife was associated with lower levels of end-of-life despair (desire for death, hopelessness and suicidal ideation) but was not associated with levels of depression or anxiety. Further analyses indicated that when spirituality levels were controlled for, the effect of afterlife beliefs disappeared. The authors concluded that spirituality has a much more powerful effect on psychological functioning than beliefs held about an afterlife. Treatment implications are discussed.",

These challenges include: 1) the identification and/or development of valid and reliable instruments; 2) adequate representation of key safety concepts, constructs, and associated concepts in the clinical information system; and 3) identification of data sources for instrument pre-population. As part of a larger project aimed at identifying and addressing the information needs of clinicians while using a clinical information system, an electronic fall and injury risk assessment instrument is in development to address a hospital-based fall and injury prevention initiative. The concepts contained in the instrument are well represented by Clinical LOINC and the UMLS. Associated concepts have been identified in the existing clinical information system data dictionary for pre-population of the instrument.",

Several studies have demonstrated that a useful way to understand the nature of the needs is to examine questions posed by physicians during the course of medical care. This paper presents an analysis of clinical questions collected when physicians were engaged in reviewing clinical cases. The main objective of the study was to investigate characteristics of the physicians' information needs to provide insight into the development of a conceptual guidance approach in information retrieval. The analysis focused on categories, search contexts, and patterns of the questions with respect to the scenarios. The results of the study showed that physicians' information needs exhibited distinct characteristics according to the scenarios, and that their needs could be expressed with a relatively small number of question patterns. These observations supported our approach of using patterns of information needs in facilitating digital information access.",

We have investigated an approach based on the minimum number of parent links between concepts, and evaluated its performance relative to human expert estimates on three sets of concepts for three terminologies within the UMLS (i.e., MeSH, ICD9CM, and SNOMED). The resulting quantitative metric enables computer-based applications that use decision thresholds and approximate matching criteria. The proposed conceptual matching supports problem solving and inferencing (using high-level, generic concepts) based on readily available data (typically represented as low-level, specific concepts). Through the identification of semantically similar concepts, conceptual matching also enables reasoning in the absence of exact, or even approximate, lexical matching. Finally, conceptual matching is relevant for terminology development and maintenance, machine learning research, decision support system development, and data mining research in biomedical informatics and other fields.",

We collected 15.5 hours of data of nurses and physicians' CIS interactions in three clinical environments (cardiac ICU, a general medical/surgical nursing, and an ambulatory clinic). We accomplished this through observational, cognitive-based methods (e.g., thinking aloud during interaction) and the video capturing of events with a portable usability laboratory.2 We developed a systematic approach to identify and define in-context clinical information needs while using a CIS, and determine how to categorize and code such events. 3",

        "Abstract": "Attempts to link clinical information systems to on-line information resources date back over a decade. The World Wide Web presents new opportunities to create such links, which we refer to as \"infobuttons\". This capability is partly due to the ease with which a link (called a Uniform Resource Locator, or URL) in one Web-based system can take users to another Web-based system, and partly due to the proliferation of high-quality Web-based resources. Typically, contextual information from the clinical system (such as patient data) is passed to a search engine that is evoked and, in turn, presents search results to the user. Impediments to infobutton development include customized programming to pass context information to the information resource, lack of standards for types and values of context information, variability of search engine interfaces, and a lack of understanding of clinicians' information needs. We are addressing these limitations with an Infobutton Manager (IM) that provides a standardized interface for matching user contexts to information resources.",

        "Abstract": "Inadequate access to patient information at the point of care has been identified as an impediment to the health care process. To create clinical computing tools that are useful to and used by clinicians, developers of clinical information systems must have accurate models of the users for whom their systems are intended. To create these models, the information needs of clinicians must be understood. While the wireless handheld environment offers many advantages such as the ability to provide mobile access to information, there are a number of challenges. Developing for this environment differs from the laptop and desktop environments due to features such as processing power, screen size, input mechanism, and bandwidth. PalmCIS (Palm-based Clinical Information System) is a clinical application being developed at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) that provides clinicians with access to patient data via a wireless handheld device. We are using an automated technique to uncover patient-specific information needs of clinicians while using a patient record system. With the results, we can enhance PalmCIS.",

This can lead to quicker access to desired information, which may facilitate the decision-making process. Qualitative methods such as interviews, observations and surveys have been commonly used to gain an understanding of clinician information needs. We introduce clinical information system (CIS) log analysis as a method for identifying patient-specific information needs and CIS log mining as an automated technique for discovering such needs in CIS log files. We have applied this method to WebCIS (Web-based Clinical Information System) log files to discover patterns of usage. The results can be used to guide design and development of relevant clinical information systems. This paper discusses the motivation behind the development of this method, describes CIS log analysis and mining, presents preliminary results and summarizes how the results can be applied.",

As with any technology, its unique features must be taken into consideration and its applications designed accordingly. In the clinical setting, availability of needed information can be crucial during the decision-making process. Preliminary studies performed at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) determined that there are inadequate access to information and ineffective communication among clinicians (potential proximal causes of medical errors). In response to these findings, the authors have been developing extensions to their Web-based clinical information system including PalmCIS, an application that provides access to needed patient information via a wireless personal digital assistant (PDA). The focus was on achieving end-to-end security and developing a highly usable system. This report discusses the motivation behind PalmCIS, design and development of the system, and future directions.",

        "Abstract": "I believe the standard for making ethical decisions should be the same for all patients: appropriate medical interventions, carefully weighing their benefits and burdens, and trying to honor the wishes of the patients. When cure is not possible, the balance between benefits and burdens should shift to greater consideration of the burden side of the equation. The ascendancy of autonomy over other medical ethical principles is the center for most of the ethical dilemmas encountered in palliative care. This paper discusses the issues of autonomy, informed consent, patient capacity, advance directives, futility, \"do-not-resuscitate\" orders, withholding or withdrawing interventions, euthanasia, and sedation therapy. After 41 years of my personally caring for over 4000 terminally ill patients, primarily at Calvary Hospital, the most practical approach has been to establish trust with patients and families, determining their goals, and diligently applying the principles of beneficence (benefits) and nonmaleficence (burdens) in everyday practice.",

        "Abstract": "As health records evolve into electronic form, increasing demand is being made to provide patients with access to them. We sought to study the character and impact of such access to determine how patients use such records, what cognitive effects it has on them, and how it affects their relationship with their health care providers. We created the Patient Clinical Information System (PatCIS) to interface with the clinical data repository at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) to allow patients to add to and review their medical data. We also provided educational resources and automated advice programs. We provided access to the system to thirteen subjects over a 36-month period and reviewed their activities in the system's usage log. We also collected data via questionnaire and telephone interview. We collected data for a total of 223 patient months. We found that patients varied in their use of the system, from once a month or less to one or more times per day. All patients primarily used the system to review laboratory results. Both they and their physicians believed that use of the system enhanced the patients' understanding of their conditions and improved their communication with their physicians. There were no adverse events encountered during the study.",

        "Abstract": "The Unified Medical Language System's (UMLS's) Semantic Network (SN)---consisting of a network of semantic types---has a two-tree structure, where each semantic type has at most one parent semantic type. This arrangement is restrictive because some semantic types are, by their definition, specializations of several parents. As a proposed enhancement to the SN, its semantic types have previously been partitioned into groups, each of which contains semantic types of some specific area. However, some groups of this proposed partition contain forest (i.e., multiple-tree) structures or even isolated semantic types. Both situations imply a disconnected internal structure. Connectivity is actually one way to assess the proposed \"semantic validity\" principle for partitions. It is a desired, although not required, property. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for identifying \"missing\" IS-A links and adding them to the SN. This process transforms the SN into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, with semantic types permitted to have multiple parents. A result of our methodology is the transformation of the proposed SN partition into groups satisfying the connectivity property.",

        "Abstract": "Too often, online searches for health information are time consuming and produce results that are not sufficiently precise to answer clinicians' or patients' questions. The PERSIVAL project is designed to circumvent this problem by personalizing and tailoring searches and presentation to the demands of the user and the particular clinical context. This paper focuses on a cognitive evaluation of one component of this project, a Query User Interface (QUI). The study examines the system's ability to allow users to easily and intuitively express their information needs. We performed several analyses including a cognitive walkthrough of the interface and quantitative estimations of cognitive load. The paper also presents a preliminary analysis of usability testing. The analyses suggest that there are features in the QUI that contribute to a greater cognitive load and result in greater effort on the part of the subject. The results of usability testing are consistent with these findings. However, subjects found it to be relatively easy and intuitive to generate well-formed queries using the interface. This study contributed to the iterative design of the interface and to the next generation of the PERSIVAL system.",

        "Abstract": "This paper reports the effects of a tailored Web-based delivery system on self-efficacy as it relates to a patients' response to acute myocardial information (AMI) symptoms. The data reported are from MI-HEART, a randomized trial examining ways in which a clinical information system can favorably influence the appropriateness and rapidity of decision-making in patients suffering from symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. Participants were randomized into one of three groups: tailored Web-based, non-tailored Web-based and non-tailored paper based. A theoretically based behavioral-cognitive model was used to identify key variables upon which to tailor education material. A key variable in the model is self-efficacy, operationalized with a three-dimensional scaling. Results show trends in improved self-efficacy scores for all groups at 1-month follow up, with sustained significant increases in baseline to 3-month scores only in the tailored Web-based group. One possible explanation could be related to \"hit-count\", which was significantly higher in the tailored group. This study is a first step in quantifying the contribution of Web-based tailoring over non-tailoring in changing key determinants of patient delay to AMI symptoms.",

Because our theory does not say, exactly, what those needs are, we are using an empirical approach (observation) to detecting and categorizing them. For each need, we can construct an \"infobutton\" that links the clinical data to an on-line information resource. We have constructed an Infobutton Manager to match the data being reviewed by clinicians with context-appropriate infobuttons. This paper describes how the theory, observations, and practical solutions can come together to improve clinician decision making by resolving information needs.",
