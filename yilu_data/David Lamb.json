        "Abstract": "Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs; P450s) are a superfamily of heme-containing enzymes that are recognized for their vast substrate range and oxidative multifunctionality. CYP107 family members perform hydroxylation and epoxidation processes, producing a variety of biotechnologically useful secondary metabolites. Despite their biotechnological importance, a thorough examination of CYP107 protein structures regarding active site cavity dynamics and key amino acids interacting with bound ligands has yet to be undertaken. To address this research knowledge gap, 44 CYP107 crystal structures were investigated in this study. We demonstrate that the CYP107 active site cavity is very flexible, with ligand binding reducing the volume of the active site in some situations and increasing volume size in other instances. Polar interactions between the substrate and active site residues result in crucial salt bridges and the formation of proton shuttling pathways. Hydrophobic interactions, however, anchor the substrate within the active site. The amino acid residues within the binding pocket influence substrate orientation and anchoring, determining the position of the hydroxylation site and hence direct CYP107's catalytic activity. Additionally, the amino acid dynamics within and around the binding pocket determine CYP107's multifunctionality. This study serves as a reference for understanding the structure-function analysis of CYP107 family members precisely and the structure-function analysis of P450 enzymes in general. Finally, this work will aid in the genetic engineering of CYP107 enzymes to produce novel molecules of biotechnological interest.",

        "Abstract": "The molecular evolution of cytochromes P450 and associated redox-driven oxidative catalysis remains a mystery in biology. It is widely believed that sterol 14\u03b1-demethylase (CYP51), an essential enzyme of sterol biosynthesis, is the ancestor of the whole P450 superfamily given its conservation across species in different biological kingdoms. Herein we have utilized X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, phylogenetics and electron transfer measurements to interrogate the nature of P450-redox partner binding using the naturally occurring fusion protein, CYP51-ferredoxin found in the sterol-producing bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus. Our data advocates that the electron transfer mechanics in the M. capsulatus CYP51-ferredoxin fusion protein involves an ensemble of ferredoxin molecules in various orientations and the interactions are transient. Close proximity of ferredoxin, however, is required to complete the substrate-induced large-scale structural switch in the P450 domain that enables proton-coupled electron transfer and subsequent oxygen scission and catalysis. These results have fundamental implications regarding the early evolution of electron transfer proteins and for the redox reactions in the early steps of sterol biosynthesis. They also shed new light on redox protein mechanics and the subsequent diversification of the P450 electron transfer machinery in nature.",

        "Title": "Metabolic arsenal of giant viruses: Host hijack or self-use?",
        "Abstract": "Viruses generally are defined as lacking the fundamental properties of living organisms in that they do not harbor an energy metabolism system or protein synthesis machinery. However, the discovery of giant viruses of amoeba has fundamentally challenged this view because of their exceptional genome properties, particle sizes and encoding of the enzyme machinery for some steps of protein synthesis. Although giant viruses are not able to replicate autonomously and still require a host for their multiplication, numerous metabolic genes involved in energy production have been recently detected in giant virus genomes from many environments. These findings have further blurred the boundaries that separate viruses and living organisms. Herein, we summarize information concerning genes and proteins involved in cellular metabolic pathways and their orthologues that have, surprisingly, been discovered in giant viruses. The remarkable diversity of metabolic genes described in giant viruses include genes encoding enzymes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, photosynthesis, and \u03b2-oxidation. These viral genes are thought to have been acquired from diverse biological sources through lateral gene transfer early in the evolution of Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses, or in some cases more recently. It was assumed that viruses are capable of hijacking host metabolic networks. But the giant virus auxiliary metabolic genes also may represent another form of host metabolism manipulation, by expanding the catalytic capabilities of the host cells especially in harsh environments, providing the infected host cells with a selective evolutionary advantage compared to non-infected cells and hence favoring the viral replication. However, the mechanism of these genes' functionality remains unclear to date.",

        "Abstract": "Animal models are important to mimic certain pathways or biological aspects of human pathologies including acute and chronic pulmonary diseases. We developed a novel and flexible mouse model of acute epithelial lung injury based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) variant 6.2-mediated expression of the human diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR). Following intratracheal administration of diphtheria toxin (DT), a cell-specific death of bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells can be observed. In contrast to other lung injury models, the here described mouse model provides the possibility of targeted injury using specific tropisms of AAV vectors or cell-type-specific promotors to drive the human DTR expression. Also, generation of cell-specific mouse lines is not required. Detailed characterization of the AAV-DTR/DT mouse model including titration of viral genome (vg) load and administered DT amount revealed increasing cell numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; macrophages, neutrophils, and unspecified cells) and elevation of degenerated cells and infiltrated leukocytes in lung tissue, dependent of vg load and DT dose. Cytokine levels in BAL fluid showed different patterns with higher vg load, e.g., IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and IP10 increasing and IL-5 and IL-6 decreasing, whereas lung function was not affected. In addition, laser-capture microdissection (LCM)-based proteomics of bronchial epithelium and alveolar tissue revealed upregulated immune and inflammatory responses in all regions and extracellular matrix deposition in infiltrated alveoli. Overall, our novel AAV-DTR/DT model allows investigation of repair mechanisms following epithelial injury and resembles specific mechanistic aspects of acute and chronic pulmonary diseases.",

        "Abstract": "AmphL is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that catalyzes the C8 oxidation of 8-deoxyamphotericin B to the polyene macrolide antibiotic, amphotericin B. To understand this substrate selectivity, we solved the crystal structure of AmphL to a resolution of 2.0\u00a0\u00c5 in complex with amphotericin B and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A detailed comparison with the closely related P450, PimD, which catalyzes the epoxidation of 4,5-desepoxypimaricin to the macrolide antibiotic, pimaricin, reveals key catalytic structural features responsible for stereo- and regio-selective oxidation. Both P450s have a similar access channel that runs parallel to the active site I helix over the surface of the heme. Molecular dynamics simulations of substrate binding reveal PimD can \"pull\" substrates further into the P450 access channel owing to additional electrostatic interactions between the protein and the carboxyl group attached to the hemiketal ring of 4,5-desepoxypimaricin. This substrate interaction is absent in AmphL although the additional substrate -OH groups in 8-deoxyamphotericin B help to correctly position the substrate for C8 oxidation. Simulations of the oxy-complex indicates that these -OH groups may also participate in a proton relay network required for O",

        "Abstract": "Orphan cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are those for which biological substrates and function(s) are unknown. Cytochrome P450 20A1 (CYP20A1) is the last human orphan P450 enzyme, and orthologs occur as single genes in every vertebrate genome sequenced to date. The occurrence of high levels of CYP20A1 transcripts in human substantia nigra and hippocampus and abundant maternal transcripts in zebrafish eggs strongly suggest roles both in the brain and during early embryonic development. Patients with chromosome 2 microdeletions including CYP20A1 show hyperactivity and bouts of anxiety, among other conditions. Here, we created zebrafish cyp20a1 mutants using CRISPR/Cas9, providing vertebrate models with which to study the role of CYP20A1 in behavior and other neurodevelopmental functions. The homozygous cyp20a1 null mutants exhibited significant behavioral differences from wild-type zebrafish, both in larval and adult animals. Larval cyp20a1-/- mutants exhibited a strong increase in light-simulated movement (i.e., light-dark assay), which was interpreted as hyperactivity. Further, the larvae exhibited mild hypoactivity during the adaptation period of the optomotor assays. Adult cyp20a1 null fish showed a pronounced delay in adapting to new environments, which is consistent with an anxiety paradigm. Taken together with our earlier morpholino cyp20a1 knockdown results, the results described herein suggest that the orphan CYP20A1 has a neurophysiological role.",

        "Abstract": "In fibroblasts, TGF\u03b21 stimulates IL11 upregulation that leads to an autocrine loop of IL11-dependent pro-fibrotic protein translation. The signaling pathways downstream of IL11, which acts via IL6ST, are contentious with both STAT3 and ERK implicated. Here we dissect IL11 signaling in fibroblasts and study IL11-dependent protein synthesis pathways in the context of approved anti-fibrotic drug mechanisms of action. We show that IL11-induced ERK activation drives fibrogenesis and while STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) is also seen, this appears unrelated to fibroblast activation. Ironically, recombinant human IL11, which has been used extensively in mouse experiments to infer STAT3 activity downstream of IL11, increases pSTAT3 in ",

        "Abstract": "The discovery of Acanthamoeba polyphaga Mimivirus, the first isolated giant virus of amoeba, challenged the historical hallmarks defining a virus. Giant virion sizes are known to reach up to 2.3\u2009\u00b5m, making them visible by optical microscopy. Their large genome sizes of up to 2.5\u2009Mb can encode proteins involved in the translation apparatus. We have investigated possible energy production in Pandoravirus massiliensis. Mitochondrial membrane markers allowed for the detection of a membrane potential in purified virions and this was enhanced by a regulator of the tricarboxylic acid cycle but abolished by the use of a depolarizing agent. Bioinformatics was employed to identify enzymes involved in virion proton gradient generation and this approach revealed that eight putative P. massiliensis proteins exhibited low sequence identities with known cellular enzymes involved in the universal tricarboxylic acid cycle. Further, all eight viral genes were transcribed during replication. The product of one of these genes, ORF132, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and shown to function as an isocitrate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Our findings show for the first time that a membrane potential can exist in Pandoraviruses, and this may be related to tricarboxylic acid cycle. The presence of a proton gradient in P. massiliensis makes this virus a form of life for which it is legitimate to ask the question \"what is a virus?\".",

        "Abstract": "Unveiling the molecular mechanisms of tissue remodelling following injury is imperative to elucidate its regenerative capacity and aberrant repair in disease. Using different omics approaches, we identified enhancer of zester homolog 2 (EZH2) as a key regulator of fibrosis in injured lung epithelium. Epithelial injury drives an enrichment of nuclear transforming growth factor-\u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) that mediates EZH2 phosphorylation to facilitate its liberation from polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). This process results in the establishment of a transcriptional complex of EZH2, RNA-polymerase II (POL2) and nuclear actin, which orchestrates aberrant epithelial repair programmes. The liberation of EZH2 from PRC2 is accompanied by an EZH2-EZH1 switch to preserve H3K27me3 deposition at non-target genes. Loss of epithelial TAK1, EZH2 or blocking nuclear actin influx attenuates the fibrotic cascade and restores respiratory homeostasis. Accordingly, EZH2 inhibition significantly improves outcomes in a pulmonary fibrosis mouse model. Our results reveal an important non-canonical function of EZH2, paving the way for new therapeutic interventions in fibrotic lung diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-11 was originally recognized as an immunomodulatory and hematopoiesis-inducing cytokine. However, although IL-11 is typically not found in healthy individuals, it is now becoming evident that IL-11 may play a role in diverse pulmonary conditions, including IPF, asthma, and lung cancer. Additionally, experimental strategies targeting IL-11, such as humanized antibodies, have recently been developed, revealing the therapeutic potential of IL-11. Thus, further insight into the underlying mechanisms of IL-11 in lung disease may lead to the ability to interfere with pathological conditions that have a clear need for disease-modifying treatments, such as IPF. In this review, we outline the effects, expression, signaling, and crosstalk of IL-11 and focus on its role in lung disease and its potential as a therapeutic target.",

        "Abstract": "In agriculture, early detection of plant stresses is advantageous in preventing crop yield losses. Remote sensors are increasingly being utilized for crop health monitoring, offering non-destructive, spatialized detection and the quantification of plant diseases at various levels of measurement. Advances in sensor technologies have promoted the development of novel techniques for precision agriculture. As in situ techniques are surpassed by multispectral imaging, refinement of hyperspectral imaging and the promising emergence of light detection and ranging (LIDAR), remote sensing will define the future of biotic and abiotic plant stress detection, crop yield estimation and product quality. The added value of LIDAR-based systems stems from their greater flexibility in capturing data, high rate of data delivery and suitability for a high level of automation while overcoming the shortcomings of passive systems limited by atmospheric conditions, changes in light, viewing angle and canopy structure. In particular, a multi-sensor systems approach and associated data fusion techniques (i.e., blending LIDAR with existing electro-optical sensors) offer increased accuracy in plant disease detection by focusing on traditional optimal estimation and the adoption of artificial intelligence techniques for spatially and temporally distributed big data. When applied across different platforms (handheld, ground-based, airborne, ground/aerial robotic vehicles or satellites), these electro-optical sensors offer new avenues to predict and react to plant stress and disease. This review examines the key sensor characteristics, platform integration options and data analysis techniques recently proposed in the field of precision agriculture and highlights the key challenges and benefits of each concept towards informing future research in this very important and rapidly growing field.",

        "Abstract": "Sterol biosynthesis, primarily associated with eukaryotic kingdoms of life, occurs as an abbreviated pathway in the bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus. Sterol 14\u03b1-demethylation is an essential step in this pathway and is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 51 (CYP51). In M.\u00a0capsulatus, the enzyme consists of the P450 domain naturally fused to a ferredoxin domain at the C-terminus (CYP51fx). The structure of M.\u00a0capsulatus CYP51fx was solved to 2.7\u2009\u00c5 resolution and is the first structure of a bacterial sterol biosynthetic enzyme. The structure contained one P450 molecule per asymmetric unit with no electron density seen for ferredoxin. We connect this with the requirement of P450 substrate binding in order to activate productive ferredoxin binding. Further, the structure of the P450 domain with bound detergent (which replaced the substrate upon crystallization) was solved to 2.4\u2009\u00c5 resolution. Comparison of these two structures to the CYP51s from human, fungi, and protozoa reveals strict conservation of the overall protein architecture. However, the structure of an \"orphan\" P450 from nonsterol-producing Mycobacterium tuberculosis that also has CYP51 activity reveals marked differences, suggesting that loss of function in vivo might have led to alterations in the structural constraints. Our results are consistent with the idea that eukaryotic and bacterial CYP51s evolved from a common cenancestor and that early eukaryotes may have recruited CYP51 from a bacterial source. The idea is supported by bioinformatic analysis, revealing the presence of CYP51 genes in >1,000 bacteria from nine different phyla, >50 of them being natural CYP51fx fusion proteins.",

It is unclear whether this is a consequence of protein deletion or loss of kinase activity. The SYK inhibitor, BI 1002494, caused no increase in proliferation in breast cancer cells or primary mammary epithelial cells in 2D or 3D cultures, nor changes in proliferation (CD1/2, CDK4, PCNA, Ki67) or invadopodia markers (MMP14, PARP, phospho-vimentin Ser56). BI 1002494 did not alter SYK protein expression. There was no change in phenotype observed in 3D cultures after addition of BI 1002494. Thirteen weeks of treatment with BI 1002494 resulted in no ductal branching or cellular proliferation in the mammary glands of mice. An ",

        "Abstract": "The optimal duration of androgen suppression for men with locally advanced prostate cancer receiving radiotherapy with curative intent is yet to be defined. Zoledronic acid is effective in preventing androgen suppression-induced bone loss, but its role in preventing castration-sensitive bone metastases in locally advanced prostate cancer is unclear. The RADAR trial assessed whether the addition of 12 months of adjuvant androgen suppression, 18 months of zoledronic acid, or both, can improve outcomes in men with locally advanced prostate cancer who receive 6 months of androgen suppression and prostatic radiotherapy. This report presents 10-year outcomes from this trial.",

        "Abstract": "Steroid refractory inflammation is an unmet medical need in the management of inflammatory diseases. Thus, mechanisms, improving steroid sensitivity and simultaneously decreasing inflammation have potential therapeutic utility. The FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is reported to influence steroid sensitivity in mental disorders. Moreover, biochemical data highlight a connection between FKBP51 and the IKK complex. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether FKBP51 inhibition had utility in modulating steroid resistant inflammation by increasing the sensitivity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signalling and simultaneously inhibiting NF\u03baB-driven inflammation. We have demonstrated that FKBP51 silencing in a bronchial epithelial cell line resulted in a 10-fold increased potency for dexamethasone towards IL1beta-induced IL6 and IL8, whilst FKBP51 over-expression of FKBP51 reduced significantly the prednisolone sensitivity in a murine HDM-driven pulmonary inflammation model. Immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-FKBP51 antibodies, confirmed the presence of FKBP51 in a complex comprising Hsp90, GR and members of the IKK family. FKBP51 silencing reduced NF\u03baB (p50/p65) nucleus translocation, resulting in reduced ICAM expression, cytokine and chemokine secretion. In conclusion, we demonstrate that FKBP51 has the potential to control inflammation in steroid insensitive patients in a steroid-dependent and independent manner and thus may be worthy of further study as a drug target.",

        "Abstract": "Lameness is a clinical symptom associated with a number of sheep diseases around the world, having adverse effects on weight gain, fertility, and lamb birth weight, and increasing the risk of secondary diseases. Current methods to identify lame animals rely on labour intensive visual inspection. The aim of this current study was to determine the ability of a collar, leg, and ear attached tri-axial accelerometer to discriminate between sound and lame gait movement in sheep. Data were separated into 10 s mutually exclusive behaviour epochs and subjected to Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). Initial analysis showed the high misclassification of lame grazing events with sound grazing and standing from all deployment modes. The final classification model, which included lame walking and all sound activity classes, yielded a prediction accuracy for lame locomotion of 82%, 35%, and 87% for the ear, collar, and leg deployments, respectively. Misclassification of sound walking with lame walking within the leg accelerometer dataset highlights the superiority of an ear mode of attachment for the classification of lame gait characteristics based on time series accelerometer data.",

        "Abstract": "Inappropriate repair responses to pulmonary epithelial injury have been linked to perturbation of epithelial barrier function and airway remodelling in a number of respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We developed an in vitro mechanical scratch injury model in air-liquid interface differentiated primary human small airway epithelial cells that recapitulates many of the characteristics observed during epithelial wound injury in both human tissue and small animal models. Wound closure was initially associated with de-differentiation of the differentiated apical cells and rapid migration into the wound site, followed by proliferation of apical cells behind the wound edge, together with increases in FAK expression, fibronectin and reduction in PAI-1 which collectively facilitate cell motility and extracellular matrix deposition. Macrophages are intimately involved in wound repair so we sought to investigate the role of macrophage sub-types on this process in a novel primary human co-culture model. M1 macrophages promoted FAK expression and both M1 and M2 macrophages promoted epithelial de-differentiation. Interestingly, M2a macrophages inhibited both proliferation and fibronectin expression, possibly via the retinoic acid pathway, whereas M2b and M2c macrophages prevented fibronectin deposition, possibly via MMP expression. Collectively these data highlight the complex nature of epithelial wound closure, the differential impact of macrophage sub-types on this process, and the heterogenic and non-delineated function of these macrophages.",

        "Title": "Molecular adaptation to high pressure in cytochrome P450 1A and aryl hydrocarbon receptor systems of the deep-sea fish Coryphaenoides armatus.",
        "Abstract": "Limited knowledge of the molecular evolution of deep-sea fish proteomes so far suggests that a few widespread residue substitutions in cytosolic proteins binding hydrophilic ligands contribute to resistance to the effects of high hydrostatic pressure (HP). Structure-function studies with additional protein systems, including membrane bound proteins, are essential to provide a more general picture of adaptation in these extremophiles. We explored molecular features of HP adaptation in proteins binding hydrophobic ligands, either in lipid bilayers (cytochrome P450 1A - CYP1A) or in the cytosol (the aryl hydrocarbon receptor - AHR), and their partners P450 oxidoreductase (POR) and AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT), respectively. Cloning studies identified the full-length coding sequence of AHR, CYP1A and POR, and a partial sequence of ARNT from Coryphaenoides armatus, an abyssal gadiform fish thriving down to 5000m depth. Inferred protein sequences were aligned with many non-deep-sea homologs to identify unique amino acid substitutions of possible relevance in HP adaptation. Positionally unique substitutions of various physicochemical properties were found in all four proteins, usually at sites of strong-to-absolute residue conservation. Some were in domains deemed important for protein-protein interaction or ligand binding. In addition, some involved removal or addition of beta-branched residues; local modifications of beta-branched residue patterns could be important to HP adaptation. In silico predictions further suggested that some unique substitutions might substantially modulate the flexibility of the polypeptide segment in which they are found. Repetitive motifs unique to the abyssal fish AHR were predicted to be rich in glycosylation sites, suggesting that post-translational changes could be involved in adaptation as well. Recombinant CYP1A and AHR showed functional properties (spectral characteristics, catalytic activity and ligand binding) that demonstrate proper folding at 1atm, indicating that they could be used as deep-sea fish protein models to further evaluate protein function under pressure.

        "Title": "Neutralization of both IL-1\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2 plays a major role in suppressing combined cigarette smoke/virus-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice.",
        "Abstract": "Smoking is an important risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and viral infections are believed to be major triggers of exacerbations, which periodically lead to a worsening of symptoms. The pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are increased in COPD patients and might contribute to disease pathology. We investigated whether individual or combined inhibition of these cytokines reduced lung inflammation in cigarette smoke (CS)-exposed and H1N1-infected BALB/c mice. Animals were treated with individual or combined antibodies (Abs) directed against IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 or IL-1R1. Cells in BAL fluid and cytokines/chemokines in lung homogenate were determined. The viral load was investigated. Blocking IL-1\u03b1 had significant suppressive effects on total cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. Furthermore, it reduced KC levels significantly. Blocking of IL-1\u03b2 did not provide significant activity. In primary human bronchial epithelial air-liquid-interface cell cultures infected with H1N1, IL-1\u03b1 Abs but not IL-1\u03b2 Abs reduced levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Concomitant usage of Abs against IL-1\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2 revealed strong effects in\u00a0vivo and reduced total cells, neutrophils and macrophages. Additionally, levels of KC, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 were significantly reduced and ICAM-1 and MUC5 A/C mRNA expression was attenuated. The viral load decreased significantly upon combined IL-1\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2 Ab treatment. Blocking the IL-1R1 provided significant effects on total cells, neutrophils and macrophages but was inferior compared to inhibiting both its soluble ligands IL-1\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2. Our results suggest that combined inhibition of IL-1\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2 might be beneficial to reduce CS/H1N1-induced airway inflammation. Moreover, combined targeting of both IL-1\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2 might be more efficient compared to individual neutralization IL-1\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 or inhibition of the IL-1R1.",

Modelling tasks of this nature also occur in other fields such as biogeography and environmental science. This analysis employs the Least Angle Regression (LAR) algorithm for fitting Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized Multiple Linear Regressions models. This analysis demonstrates the efficiency of the LAR algorithm at selecting covariates to aid the interpolation of geostatistical soil carbon observations. Where an exhaustive search of the models that could be constructed from 800 potential covariate terms and 60 observations would be prohibitively demanding, LASSO variable selection is accomplished with trivial computational investment.",

The platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) is a key player in arterial thrombosis and a critical determinant of stroke outcome, making its signaling pathway an attractive target for pharmacological intervention. The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is an essential signaling mediator downstream of not only GPVI but also other platelet and immune cell receptors.

        "Title": "BI 1002494, a Novel Potent and Selective Oral Spleen Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, Displays Differential Potency in Human Basophils and B Cells.",
        "Abstract": "BI 1002494 [(R)-4-{(R)-1-[7-(3,4,5-trimethoxy-phenyl)-[1,6]napthyridin-5-yloxy]-ethyl}pyrrolidin-2-one] is a novel, potent, and selective spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor with sustained plasma exposure after oral administration in rats, which qualifies this molecule as a good in vitro and in vivo tool compound. BI 1002494 exhibits higher potency in inhibiting high-affinity IgE receptor-mediated mast cell and basophil degranulation (IC50 = 115 nM) compared with B-cell receptor-mediated activation of B cells (IC50 = 810 nM). This may be explained by lower kinase potency when the physiologic ligand B-cell linker was used, suggesting that SYK inhibitors may exhibit differential potency depending on the cell type and the respective signal transduction ligand. A 3-fold decrease in potency was observed in rat basophils (IC50 = 323 nM) compared with human basophils, but a similar species potency shift was not observed in B cells. The lower potency in rat basophils was confirmed in both ex vivo inhibition of bronchoconstriction in precision-cut rat lung slices and in reversal of anaphylaxis-driven airway resistance in rats. The different cellular potencies translated into different in vivo efficacy; full efficacy in a rat ovalbumin model (that contains an element of mast cell dependence) was achieved with a trough plasma concentration of 340 nM, whereas full efficacy in a rat collagen-induced arthritis model (that contains an element of B-cell dependence) was achieved with a trough plasma concentration of 1400 nM. Taken together, these data provide a platform from which different estimates of human efficacious exposures can be made according to the relevant cell type for the indication intended to be treated.",

        "Abstract": "Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes for which there is no functional information are considered \"orphan\" CYPs. Previous studies showed that CYP20A1, an orphan, is expressed in human hippocampus and substantia nigra, and in zebrafish (Danio rerio) CYP20A1 maternal transcript occurs in eggs, suggesting involvement in brain and in early development. Moreover, hyperactivity is reported in humans with chromosome 2 microdeletions including CYP20A1. We examined CYP20A1 in zebrafish, including impacts of chemical exposure on expression. Zebrafish CYP20A1 cDNA was cloned, sequenced, and aligned with cloned human CYP20A1 and predicted vertebrate orthologs. CYP20A1s share a highly conserved N-terminal region and unusual sequences in the I-helix and the heme-binding CYP signature motifs. CYP20A1 mRNA expression was observed in adult zebrafish organs including the liver, heart, gonads, spleen and brain, as well as the eye and optic nerve. Putative binding sites in proximal promoter regions of CYP20A1s, and response of zebrafish CYP20A1 to selected nuclear and xenobiotic receptor agonists, point to up-regulation by agents involved in steroid hormone response, cholesterol and lipid metabolism. There also was a dose-dependent reduction of CYP20A1 expression in embryos exposed to environmentally relevant levels of methylmercury. Morpholino knockdown of CYP20A1 in developing zebrafish resulted in behavioral effects, including hyperactivity and a slowing of the optomotor response in larvae. The results suggest that altered expression of CYP20A1 might be part of a mechanism linking methylmercury exposure to neurobehavioral deficits. The expanded information on CYP20A1 brings us closer to \"deorphanization\", that is, identifying CYP20A1 functions and its roles in health and disease.",

        "Title": "Genetic and structural analyses of cytochrome P450 hydroxylases in sex hormone biosynthesis: Sequential origin and subsequent coevolution.",
        "Abstract": "Biosynthesis of steroid hormones in vertebrates involves three cytochrome P450 hydroxylases, CYP11A1, CYP17A1 and CYP19A1, which catalyze sequential steps in steroidogenesis. These enzymes are conserved in the vertebrates, but their origin and existence in other chordate subphyla (Tunicata and Cephalochordata) have not been clearly established. In this study, selected protein sequences of CYP11A1, CYP17A1 and CYP19A1 were compiled and analyzed using multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. Our analyses show that cephalochordates have sequences orthologous to vertebrate CYP11A1, CYP17A1 or CYP19A1, and that echinoderms and hemichordates possess CYP11-like but not CYP19 genes. While the cephalochordate sequences have low identity with the vertebrate sequences, reflecting evolutionary distance, the data show apparent origin of CYP11 prior to the evolution of CYP19 and possibly CYP17, thus indicating a sequential origin of these functionally related steroidogenic CYPs. Co-occurrence of the three CYPs in early chordates suggests that the three genes may have coevolved thereafter, and that functional conservation should be reflected in functionally important residues in the proteins. CYP19A1 has the largest number of conserved residues while CYP11A1 sequences are less conserved. Structural analyses of human CYP11A1, CYP17A1 and CYP19A1 show that critical substrate binding site residues are highly conserved in each enzyme family. The results emphasize that the steroidogenic pathways producing glucocorticoids and reproductive steroids are several hundred million years old and that the catalytic structural elements of the enzymes have been conserved over the same period of time. Analysis of these elements may help to identify when precursor functions linked to these enzymes first arose.",

        "Abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus is the opportunistic fungal pathogen that predominantly affects the immunocompromised population and causes 600,000 deaths/year. The cytochrome P450 51 (CYP51) inhibitor voriconazole is currently the drug of choice, yet the treatment efficiency remains low, calling for rational development of more efficient agents. A. fumigatus has two CYP51 genes, CYP51A and CYP51B, which share 59% amino acid sequence identity. CYP51B is expressed constitutively, whereas gene CYP51A is reported to be inducible. We expressed, purified, and characterized A. fumigatus CYP51B, including determination of its substrate preferences, catalytic parameters, inhibition, and x-ray structure in complexes with voriconazole and the experimental inhibitor (R)-N-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)ethyl)-4-(5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzamide (VNI). The enzyme demethylated its natural substrate eburicol and the plant CYP51 substrate obtusifoliol at steady-state rates of 17 and 16 min(-1), respectively, but did not metabolize lanosterol, and the topical antifungal drug miconazole was the strongest inhibitor that we identified. The x-ray crystal structures displayed high overall similarity of A. fumigatus CYP51B to CYP51 orthologs from other biological kingdoms but revealed phylum-specific differences relevant to enzyme catalysis and inhibition. The complex with voriconazole provides an explanation for the potency of this relatively small molecule, whereas the complex with VNI outlines a direction for further enhancement of the efficiency of this new inhibitory scaffold to treat humans afflicted with filamentous fungal infections.",

        "Abstract": "In this study, we investigate the amebicidal activities of the pharmaceutical triazole CYP51 inhibitors fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole against Acanthamoeba castellanii and Acanthamoeba polyphaga and assess their potential as therapeutic agents against Acanthamoeba infections in humans. Amebicidal activities of the triazoles were assessed by in vitro minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) determinations using trophozoites of A. castellanii and A. polyphaga. In addition, triazole effectiveness was assessed by ligand binding studies and inhibition of CYP51 activity of purified A. castellanii CYP51 (AcCYP51) that was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. Itraconazole and voriconazole bound tightly to AcCYP51 (dissociation constant [Kd] of 10 and 13 nM), whereas fluconazole bound weakly (Kd of 2,137 nM). Both itraconazole and voriconazole were confirmed to be strong inhibitors of AcCYP51 activity (50% inhibitory concentrations [IC50] of 0.23 and 0.39 \u03bcM), whereas inhibition by fluconazole was weak (IC50, 30 \u03bcM). However, itraconazole was 8- to 16-fold less effective (MIC, 16 mg/liter) at inhibiting A. polyphaga and A. castellanii cell proliferation than voriconazole (MIC, 1 to 2 mg/liter), while fluconazole did not inhibit Acanthamoeba cell division (MIC, >64 mg/liter) in vitro. Voriconazole was an effective inhibitor of trophozoite proliferation for A. castellanii and A. polyphaga; therefore, it should be evaluated in trials versus itraconazole for controlling Acanthamoeba infections.",

        "Title": "A novel model of IgE-mediated passive pulmonary anaphylaxis in rats.",
        "Abstract": "Mast cells are central effector cells in allergic asthma and are augmented in the airways of asthma patients. Attenuating mast cell degranulation and with it the early asthmatic response is an important intervention point to inhibit bronchoconstriction, plasma exudation and tissue oedema formation. To validate the efficacy of novel pharmacological interventions, appropriate and practicable in vivo models reflecting mast cell-dependent mechanisms in the lung, are missing. Thus, we developed a novel model of passive pulmonary anaphylaxis in rats. Rats were passively sensitized by concurrent intratracheal and intradermal (ear) application of an anti-DNP IgE antibody. Intravenous application of the antigen, DNP-BSA in combination with Evans blue dye, led to mast cell degranulation in both tissues. Quantification of mast cell degranulation in the lung was determined by (1) mediator release into bronchoalveolar lavage, (2) extravasation of Evans blue dye into tracheal and bronchial lung tissue and (3) invasive measurement of antigen-induced bronchoconstriction. Quantification of mast cell degranulation in the ear was determined by extravasation of Evans blue dye into ear tissue. We pharmacologically validated our model using the SYK inhibitor Fostamatinib, the H1-receptor antagonist Desloratadine, the mast cell stabilizer disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) and the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor agonist Formoterol. Fostamatinib was equally efficacious in lung and ear. Desloratadine effectively inhibited bronchoconstriction and ear vascular leakage, but was less effective against pulmonary vascular leakage, perhaps reflecting the differing roles for histamine receptor sub-types. DSCG attenuated both vascular leakage in the lung and bronchoconstriction, but with a very short duration of action. As an inhaled approach, Formoterol was more effective in the lung than in the ear. This model of passive pulmonary anaphylaxis provides a tissue relevant readout of early mast cell activity and pharmacological benchmarking broadly reflects responses observed in patients with asthma.",

        "Title": "Designing mixed species tree plantations for the tropics: balancing ecological attributes of species with landholder preferences in the Philippines.",
        "Abstract": "A mixed species reforestation program known as the Rainforestation Farming system was undertaken in the Philippines to develop forms of farm forestry more suitable for smallholders than the simple monocultural plantations commonly used then. In this study, we describe the subsequent changes in stand structure and floristic composition of these plantations in order to learn from the experience and develop improved prescriptions for reforestation systems likely to be attractive to smallholders. We investigated stands aged from 6 to 11 years old on three successive occasions over a 6 year period. We found the number of species originally present in the plots as trees >5 cm dbh decreased from an initial total of 76 species to 65 species at the end of study period. But, at the same time, some new species reached the size class threshold and were recruited into the canopy layer. There was a substantial decline in tree density from an estimated stocking of about 5000 trees per ha at the time of planting to 1380 trees per ha at the time of the first measurement; the density declined by a further 4.9% per year. Changes in composition and stand structure were indicated by a marked shift in the Importance Value Index of species. Over six years, shade-intolerant species became less important and the native shade-tolerant species (often Dipterocarps) increased in importance. Based on how the Rainforestation Farming plantations developed in these early years, we suggest that mixed-species plantations elsewhere in the humid tropics should be around 1000 trees per ha or less, that the proportion of fast growing (and hence early maturing) trees should be about 30-40% of this initial density and that any fruit tree component should only be planted on the plantation margin where more light and space are available for crowns to develop.",

        "Title": "Clinical significance of cancer in radical prostatectomy specimens: analysis from a contemporary series of 2900 men.",
        "Abstract": "With prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing, up to 49% of detected tumours are small and in some of these cases there is a possibility that the tumour will remain clinically insignificant during the patient's remaining lifetime. The current study was performed to characterise the extent of cancer in men treated by radical prostatectomy (RP) in a community without population-based PSA screening. Clinical and pathological data of 2900 patients who underwent RP between 2008 and 2012 were analysed. Specimens were entirely embedded and evaluated by routine haematoxylin and eosin staining. Tumours were graded using recent modifications to the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) modified Gleason grading system, and staged according to the ISUP recommendations. Tumours were considered pathologically insignificant if organ confined, with a volume of <0.5\u200a cc and a Gleason score (GS) of <7. The mean age of patients in the series was 63 years (range 32-79 years) and the mean pre-operative PSA was 7.16 \u200ang/mL (range 0.4-69). In total, 2614 (90.1%) were classified as cT1; however, insignificant tumours were found in only 150 (5.2%) patients following examination of the radical prostatectomy specimen. A total of 2681 cases (92.4%) had a final GS of \u22657, 1144 (39.4%) had extraprostatic extension (EPE), of which 88.7% were classified as established; 669 (23.1%) had a tumour volume of >3\u200a cc and 284 (9.8%) had surgical margin positivity. Seminal vesicle involvement was seen in 159 (5.5%) cases. Of 693 patients who had a lymphadenectomy, 31 (4.5%) had lymph node metastases. Aged \u226450 years were 212 (7.3%) patients (mean age 47 years). Of these, 194 were classified as cT1 while 192 (90.6%) were found to have significant cancer on examination of the radical prostatectomy specimen. We have shown in our series that although 90.1% of tumours were cT1, an overwhelming majority of tumours were found to be pathologically significant following RP, with a high proportion of cases showing high stage disease, seminal vesicle involvement and lymph node metastasis. These results suggest that, contrary to estimates from international trials, ad hoc PSA testing is associated with low levels of over-treating.",

        "Title": "Functional and structural characterisation of a viral cytochrome b5.",
        "Abstract": "Cytochrome b5 is a ubiquitous electron transport protein. The sequenced viral OtV-2 genome, which infects Ostreococcus tauri, was predicted to encode a putative cytochrome b5 enzyme. Using purified OtV-2 cytochrome b5 we confirm this protein has identical spectral properties to purified human cytochrome b5 and additionally that the viral enzyme can substitute for yeast cytochrome b5 in yeast cytochrome P450 51 mediated sterol 14\u03b1-demethylation. The crystal structure of the OtV-2 cytochrome b5 enzyme reveals a single domain, comprising four \u03b2 sheets, four \u03b1 helices and a haem moiety, which is similar to that found in larger eukaryotic cytochrome proteins. As a product of a horizontal gene transfer event involving a subdomain of the host fumarate reductase-like protein, OtV-2 cytochrome b5 appears to have diverged in function and is likely to have evolved an entirely new role for the virus during infection. Indeed, lacking a hydrophobic C-terminal anchor, OtV-2 encodes the first cytosolic cytochrome b5 characterised. The lack of requirement for membrane attachment (in contrast to all other microsomal cytochrome b5s) may be a reflection of the small size of the host cell, further emphasizes the unique nature of this virus gene product and draws attention to the potential importance of cytochrome b5 metabolic activity at the extremes of cellular scale.",

        "Abstract": "A significant number of clinical asthma exacerbations are triggered by viral infection. We aimed to characterize the effect of virus infection in an HDM (house dust mite) mouse model of asthma and assess the effect of oral corticosteroids. HDM alone significantly increased eosinophils, lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages and a number of cytokines in BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage), all of which were sensitive to treatment with prednisolone (with the exception of neutrophils). Virus infection also induced cell infiltration and cytokines. RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) infection in HDM-treated animals further increased all cell types in BAL (except eosinophils, which declined), but induced no further increase in HDM-elicited cytokines. However, while HDM-elicited TNF-\u03b1 (tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1), IFN-\u03b3 (interferon-\u03b3), IL (interleukin)-2, IL-5 and IL-10 were sensitive to prednisolone treatment, concomitant infection with RSV blocked the sensitivity towards steroid. In contrast, influenza infection in HDM- challenged animals resulted in increased BAL lymphocytes, neutrophils, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-12, but all were attenuated by prednisolone treatment. HDM also increased eNO (exhaled NO), which was further increased by concomitant virus infection. This increase was only partially attenuated by prednisolone. RSV infection alone increased BAL mucin. However, BAL mucin was increased in HDM animals with virus infection. Chronic HDM challenge in mice elicits a broad inflammatory response that shares many characteristics with clinical asthma. Concomitant influenza or RSV infection elicits differing inflammatory profiles that differ in their sensitivity towards steroids. This model may be suitable for the assessment of novel pharmacological interventions for asthmatic exacerbation.",

        "Abstract": "The filamentous bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor has a complex life cycle involving the formation of hair-like aerial mycelia on the colony surface, which differentiate into chains of spores. Genes required for the initiation of aerial mycelium formation have been termed 'bld' (bald), describing the smooth, undifferentiated colonies of mutant strains. We report the identification of a new bld gene designated as sco3099 and biochemical analysis of its encoded enzyme, cytochrome P450 (P450, or CYP) 107U1. Deletion of sco3099 resulted in a mutant defective in aerial hyphae sporulation and sensitive to heat shock, indicating that P450 107U1 plays a key role in growth and development of S. coelicolor. This is the first P450 reported to participate in a sporulation process in Streptomycetes. The substrate and catalytic properties of P450 107U1 were further investigated in mass spectrometry-based metabolomic studies. Glycocholic acid (from the medium) was identified as a substrate of P450 107U1 and was oxidized to glyco-7-oxo-deoxycholic acid. Although this reaction is apparently not relevant to the observed sporulation deficiency, it suggests that P450 107U1 might exert its physiological function by oxidizing other steroid-like molecules.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose. Survival following biochemical failure is highly variable. Using a randomized trial dataset, we sought to define a risk stratification scheme in men with locally advanced prostate cancer (LAPC). Methods. The TROG 96.01 trial randomized 802 men with LAPC to radiation\u2009\u00b1\u2009neoadjuvant androgen suppression therapy (AST) between 1996 and 2000. Ten-year follow-up data was used to develop three-tier post-biochemical failure risk stratification schemes based on cutpoints of time to biochemical failure (TTBF) and PSA doubling time (PSADT). Schemes were evaluated in univariable, competing risk models for prostate cancer-specific mortality. The performance was assessed by c-indices and internally validated by the simple bootstrap method. Performance rankings were compared in sensitivity analyses using multivariable models and variations in PSADT calculation. Results. 485 men developed biochemical failure. c-indices ranged between 0.630 and 0.730. The most discriminatory scheme had a high risk category defined by PSADT\u2009<\u20094 months or TTBF\u2009<\u20091 year and low risk category by PSADT\u2009>\u20099 months or TTBF\u2009>\u20093 years. Conclusion. TTBF and PSADT can be combined to define risk stratification schemes after biochemical failure in men with LAPC treated with short-term AST and radiotherapy. External validation, particularly in long-term AST and radiotherapy datasets, is necessary.",

        "Abstract": "During the early years of cytochrome P450 research, a picture of conserved properties arose from studies of mammalian forms of these monooxygenases. They included the protohaem prosthetic group, the cysteine residue that coordinates to the haem iron and the reduced CO difference spectrum. Alternatively, the most variable feature of P450s was the enzymatic activities, which led to the conclusion that there are a large number of these enzymes, most of which have yet to be discovered. More recently, studies of these enzymes in other eukaryotes and in prokaryotes have led to the discovery of unexpected P450 properties. Many are variations of the original properties, whereas others are difficult to explain because of their unique nature relative to the rest of the known members of the superfamily. These novel properties expand our appreciation of the broad view of P450 structure and function, and generate curiosity concerning the evolution of P450s. In some cases, structural properties, previously not found in P450s, can lead to enzymatic activities impacting the biological function of organisms containing these enzymes; whereas, in other cases, the biological reason for the variations are not easily understood. Herein, we present particularly interesting examples in detail rather than cataloguing them all.",

        "Abstract": "Coelibactin is a putative non-ribosomally synthesized peptide with predicted zincophore activity and which has been implicated in antibiotic regulation in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). The coelibactin biosynthetic pathway contains a stereo- and regio-specific monooxygenation step catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP105N1). We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of CYP105N1 at 2.9 \u00c5 and analyzed it in the context of the bacterial CYP105 family as a whole. The crystal structure reveals a channel between the \u03b1-helical domain and the \u03b2-sheet domain exposing the heme pocket and the long helix I to the solvent. This wide-open conformation of CYP105N1 may be related to the bulky substrate coelibactin. The ligand-free CYP105N1 structure has enough room in the substrate access channel to allow the coelibactin to enter into the active site. Analysis of typical siderophore ligands suggests that CYP105N1 may produce derivatives of coelibactin, which would then be able to chelate the zinc divalent cation.",

        "Abstract": "The effects of S279F and S279Y point mutations in Candida albicans CYP51 (CaCYP51) on protein activity and on substrate (lanosterol) and azole antifungal binding were investigated. Both S279F and S279Y mutants bound lanosterol with 2-fold increased affinities (K(s), 7.1 and 8.0 \u03bcM, respectively) compared to the wild-type CaCYP51 protein (K(s), 13.5 \u03bcM). The S279F and S279Y mutants and the wild-type CaCYP51 protein bound fluconazole, voriconazole, and itraconazole tightly, producing typical type II binding spectra. However, the S279F and S279Y mutants had 4- to 5-fold lower affinities for fluconazole, 3.5-fold lower affinities for voriconazole, and 3.5- to 4-fold lower affinities for itraconazole than the wild-type CaCYP51 protein. The S279F and S279Y mutants gave 2.3- and 2.8-fold higher 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC\u2085\u2080s) for fluconazole in a CYP51 reconstitution assay than the wild-type protein did. The increased fluconazole resistance conferred by the S279F and S279Y point mutations appeared to be mediated through a combination of a higher affinity for substrate and a lower affinity for fluconazole. In addition, lanosterol displaced fluconazole from the S279F and S279Y mutants but not from the wild-type protein. Molecular modeling of the wild-type protein indicated that the oxygen atom of S507 interacts with the second triazole ring of fluconazole, assisting in orientating fluconazole so that a more favorable binding conformation to heme is achieved. In contrast, in the two S279 mutant proteins, this S507-fluconazole interaction is absent, providing an explanation for the higher K(d) values observed.",

        "Title": "Investigating conservation of the albaflavenone biosynthetic pathway and CYP170 bifunctionality in streptomycetes.",
        "Abstract": "Albaflavenone, a tricyclic sesquiterpene antibiotic, is biosynthesized in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) by enzymes encoded in a two-gene operon. Initially, sesquiterpene cyclase catalyzes the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to the terpenoid epi-isozizaene, which is oxidized to the final albaflavenone by cytochrome P450 (CYP)170A1. Additionally, this CYP is a bifunctional enzyme, being able to also generate farnesene isomers from farnesyl diphosphate, owing to a terpene synthase active site moonlighting on the CYP molecule. To explore the functionality of this operon in other streptomycetes, we have examined culture extracts by GC/MS and established the presence of albaflavenone in five Streptomyces species. Bioinformatics examination of the predicted CYP170 primary amino acid sequences revealed substitutions in the CYP terpene synthase active site. To examine whether the terpene synthase site was catalytically active in another CYP170, we characterized the least related CYP170 orthologue from Streptomyces albus (CYP170B1). Following expression and purification, CYP170B1 showed a normal reduced CO difference spectrum at 450 nm, in contrast to the unusual 440-nm peak observed for S. coelicolor A3(2) CYP170A1. CYP170B1 can catalyze the conversion of epi-isozizaene to albaflavenone, but was unable to catalyze the conversion of farnesyl diphosphate to farnesene. Molecular modeling with our crystal structure of CYP170A1 suggests that the absence of key amino acids for binding the essential terpene synthase cofactor Mg(2+) may be the explanation for the loss of CYP170B1 bifunctionality.",

        "Abstract": "Androgen suppression therapy and radiotherapy are used to treat locally advanced prostate cancer. 3 years of androgen suppression confers a small survival benefit compared with 6 months of therapy in this setting, but is associated with more toxic effects. Early identification of men in whom radiotherapy and 6 months of androgen suppression is insufficient for cure is important. Thus, we assessed whether prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values can act as an early surrogate for prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM).",

        "Abstract": "CYP164 family P450 enzymes are found in only a subset of mycobacteria and include CYP164A1, which is the sole P450 found in Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy. This has previously led to interest in this enzyme as a potential drug target. Here we describe the first crystal structure of a CYP164 enzyme, CYP164A2 from Mycobacterium smegmatis. CYP164A2 has a distinctive, enlarged hydrophobic active site that extends above the porphyrin ring toward the access channels. Unusually, we find that CYP164A2 can simultaneously bind two econazole molecules in different regions of the enlarged active site and is accompanied by the rearrangement and ordering of the BC loop. The primary location is through a classic interaction of the azole group with the porphyrin iron. The second econazole molecule is bound to a unique site and is linked to a tetracoordinated metal ion complexed to one of the heme carboxylates and to the side chains of His 105 and His 364. All of these features are preserved in the closely homologous M. leprae CYP164A1. The computational docking of azole compounds to a homology model of CYP164A1 suggests that these compounds will form effective inhibitors and is supported by the correlation of parallel docking with experimental binding studies of CYP164A2. The binding of econazole to CYP164A2 occurs primarily through the high-spin \"open\" conformation of the enzyme (K(d) [dissociation constant] of 0.1 \u03bcM), with binding to the low-spin \"closed\" form being significantly hindered (K(d) of 338 \u03bcM). These studies support previous suggestions that azole derivatives may provide an effective strategy to improve the treatment of leprosy.",

        "Abstract": "Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) promise specific correction of disease-causing gene expression. Therapeutic implementation, however, has been forestalled by poor delivery to the appropriate tissue, cell type, and subcellular compartment. Topical administration is considered to circumvent these issues. The availability of inhalation devices and unmet medical need in lung disease has focused efforts in this tissue. We report the development of a novel cell sorting method for quantitative, cell type-specific analysis of siRNA, and locked nucleic acid (LNA) ASO uptake and efficacy after intratracheal (i.t.) administration in mice. Through fluorescent dye labeling, we compare the utility of this approach to whole animal and whole tissue analysis, and examine the extent of tissue distribution. We detail rapid systemic access and renal clearance for both therapeutic classes and lack of efficacy at the protein level in lung macrophages, epithelia, or other cell types. We nevertheless observe efficient redirection of i.t. administered phosphorothioate (PS) LNA ASO to the liver and kidney leading to targeted gene knockdown. These data suggest delivery remains a key obstacle to topically administered, naked oligonucleotide efficacy in the lung and introduce inhalation as a potentially viable alternative to injection for antisense administration to the liver and kidneys.",

        "Abstract": "In this Letter we present data for a novel series of ICS for the treatment of asthma. 'Inhalation by design' principles have been applied to a series of highly potent steroidal GR agonists, with a focus on optimising the potential therapeutic index in human. Pharmacokinetic properties were tuned with high intrinsic clearance and low oral bioavailability in mind, to minimise systemic exposure and reduce systemically driven adverse events. High CYP mediated clearance as well as glucuronidation were targeted to achieve high intrinsic clearance coupled with multiple routes of clearance to minimise drug-drug interactions. Furthermore, pharmaceutical properties such as stability, crystallinity and solubility were considered to ensure compatibility with a dry powder inhaler. This work culminated in the identification of the clinical candidate 15, which demonstrates preclinically the desired efficacy and safety profiles confirming its potential as an inhaled agent for the treatment of asthma.",

        "Abstract": "An empirical \"guided-mode refraction model\" has been invoked to explain the optical attenuation of radiation in an exposed core optical fiber sensor subject to heterogeneous (surface) crystal growth. Based on Fresnel reflectance values at the internal fiber-crystal and crystal-solution interfaces, the model predictions agree with experimental observations of radial loss of radiation from the fiber core through the crystals as well as attenuation of guided radiation as a function of the radiation launch angle into the fiber.",

        "Abstract": "We report a comprehensive genetic, metabolomic, and biochemical study on the catalytic properties of Streptomyces coelicolor cytochrome P450 (P450) 154A1, known to have a unique heme orientation in its crystal structure. Deletion of the P450 154A1 gene compromised the long-term stability of the bacterial spores. A novel dipentaenone (1) with a high degree of conjugation was identified as an endogenous substrate of P450 154A1 using a metabolomics approach. The biotransformation of 1 by P450 154A1 was shown to be an unexpected intramolecular cyclization to a Patern\u00f2-B\u00fcchi-like product, without oxidation/reduction.",

        "Title": "Nitrogen and phosphorus additions negatively affect tree species diversity in tropical forest regrowth trajectories.",
        "Abstract": "Nutrient enrichment is increasingly affecting many tropical ecosystems, but there is no information on how this affects tree biodiversity. To examine dynamics in vegetation structure and tree species biomass and diversity, we annually remeasured tree species before and for six years after repeated additions of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in permanent plots of abandoned pasture in Amazonia. Nitrogen and, to a lesser extent, phosphorus addition shifted growth among woody species. Nitrogen stimulated growth of two common pioneer tree species and one common tree species adaptable to both high- and low-light environments, while P stimulated growth only of the dominant pioneer tree Rollinia exsucca (Annonaceae). Overall, N or P addition reduced tree assemblage evenness and delayed tree species accrual over time, likely due to competitive monopolization of other resources by the few tree species responding to nutrient enrichment with enhanced establishment and/or growth rates. Absolute tree growth rates were elevated for two years after nutrient addition. However, nutrient-induced shifts in relative tree species growth and reduced assemblage evenness persisted for more than three years after nutrient addition, favoring two nutrient-responsive pioneers and one early-secondary tree species. Surprisingly, N + P effects on tree biomass and species diversity were consistently weaker than N-only and P-only effects, because grass biomass increased dramatically in response to N + P addition. The resulting intensified competition probably prevented an expected positive N + P synergy in the tree assemblage. Thus, N or P enrichment may favor unknown tree functional response types, reduce the diversity of coexisting species, and delay species accrual during structurally and functionally complex tropical rainforest secondary succession.",

        "Abstract": "Purified Candida albicans sterol 14-\u03b1 demethylase (CaCYP51) bound the CYP51 substrates lanosterol and eburicol, producing type I binding spectra with K(s) values of 11 and 25 \u03bcM, respectively, and a K(m) value of 6 \u03bcM for lanosterol. Azole binding to CaCYP51 was \"tight\" with both the type II spectral intensity (\u0394A(max)) and the azole concentration required to obtain a half-\u0394A(max) being proportional to the CaCYP51 concentration. Tight binding of fluconazole and itraconazole was confirmed by 50% inhibitory concentration determinations from CYP51 reconstitution assays. CaCYP51 had similar affinities for clotrimazole, econazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, and voriconazole, with K(d) values of 10 to 26 \u03bcM under oxidative conditions, compared with 47 \u03bcM for fluconazole. The affinities of CaCYP51 for fluconazole and itraconazole appeared to be 4- and 2-fold lower based on CO displacement studies than those when using direct ligand binding under oxidative conditions. Econazole and miconazole were most readily displaced by carbon monoxide, followed by clotrimazole, ketoconazole, and fluconazole, and then voriconazole (7.8 pmol min(-1)), but itraconzole could not be displaced by carbon monoxide. This work reports in depth the characterization of the azole binding properties of wild-type C. albicans CYP51, including that of voriconazole, and will contribute to effective screening of new therapeutic azole antifungal agents. Preliminary comparative studies with the I471T CaCYP51 protein suggested that fluconazole resistance conferred by this mutation was through a combination of increased turnover, increased affinity for substrate, and a reduced affinity for fluconazole in the presence of substrate, allowing the enzyme to remain functionally active, albeit at reduced velocity, at higher fluconazole concentrations.",

        "Abstract": "The gene from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) encoding CYP102B1, a recently discovered CYP102 subfamily which exists solely as a single P450 heme domain, has been cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, characterized, and compared to its fusion protein family members. Purified reconstitution metabolism experiments with spinach ferredoxin, ferredoxin reductase, and NADPH revealed differences in the regio- and stereoselective metabolism of arachidonic acid compared to that of CYP102A1, exclusively producing 11,12-epoxyeicosa-5,8,14-trienoic acid in addition to the shared metabolites 18-hydroxy arachidonic acid and 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5,8,11-trienoic acid. Consequently, in order to elucidate the physiological function of CYP102B1, transposon mutagenesis was used to generate an S. coelicolor A3(2) strain lacking CYP102B1 activity and the phenotype was assessed.",

        "Abstract": "In the wake of widespread loss of old-growth forests throughout the tropics, secondary forests will likely play a growing role in the conservation of forest biodiversity. We considered a complex hierarchy of factors that interact in space and time to determine the conservation potential of tropical secondary forests. Beyond the characteristics of local forest patches, spatial and temporal landscape dynamics influence the establishment, species composition, and persistence of secondary forests. Prospects for conservation of old-growth species in secondary forests are maximized in regions where the ratio of secondary to old-growth forest area is relatively low, older secondary forests have persisted, anthropogenic disturbance after abandonment is relatively low, seed-dispersing fauna are present, and old-growth forests are close to abandoned sites. The conservation value of a secondary forest is expected to increase over time, as species arriving from remaining old-growth forest patches accumulate. Many studies are poorly replicated, which limits robust assessments of the number and abundance of old-growth species present in secondary forests. Older secondary forests are not often studied and few long-term studies are conducted in secondary forests. Available data indicate that both old-growth and second-growth forests are important to the persistence of forest species in tropical, human-modified landscapes.",

        "Abstract": "Monocyte recruitment and their differentiation into macrophages are both early events in native and accelerated atherosclerosis that follows angioplasty. We have investigated the putative functional role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) present on rabbit monocytes/macrophages. The impact of periadventitial delivery of an EGFR-specific, blocking monoclonal antibody (ICR62, which inhibits EGF-binding to its receptor) was investigated in a rabbit model of accelerated atherosclerosis induced by a combination of carotid injury and 4 weeks of a 2% cholesterol-diet. Two weeks after the initiation of the diet, a balloon-catheter angioplasty of the left common carotid artery was performed and a collar placed around the injured carotid artery immediately, for the delivery of ICR62 antibody, isotype-matched antibody or saline control. Monocyte/macrophage accumulation, cell proliferation and neointimal thickening were determined 2 weeks after the delivery of the antibodies. The function of the EGFR on rabbit monocytes was also investigated in vitro, using chemotaxis assays. Treatment with ICR62 was associated with a significant reduction in macrophage accumulation and neointimal thickening and a 76% reduction in neointimal area of the vessel wall compared with controls. In vitro ICR62 inhibited macrophage and smooth muscle cell migration towards EGFR ligands including EGF and HB-EGF. These findings suggest that EGFR ligation may be important in the development of early atherosclerotic lesions following balloon-catheter angioplasty, and periadventitial delivery may provide a feasible approach for administration of the inhibitors of EGFR-binding such as ICR62.",

        "Abstract": "Albaflavenone synthase (CYP170A1) is a monooxygenase catalyzing the final two steps in the biosynthesis of this antibiotic in the soil bacterium, Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Interestingly, CYP170A1 shows no stereo selection forming equal amounts of two albaflavenol epimers, each of which is oxidized in turn to albaflavenone. To explore the structural basis of the reaction mechanism, we have studied the crystal structures of both ligand-free CYP170A1 (2.6 A) and complex of endogenous substrate (epi-isozizaene) with CYP170A1 (3.3 A). The structure of the complex suggests that the proximal epi-isozizaene molecules may bind to the heme iron in two orientations. In addition, much to our surprise, we have found that albaflavenone synthase also has a second, completely distinct catalytic activity corresponding to the synthesis of farnesene isomers from farnesyl diphosphate. Within the cytochrome P450 alpha-helical domain both the primary sequence and x-ray structure indicate the presence of a novel terpene synthase active site that is moonlighting on the P450 structure. This includes signature sequences for divalent cation binding and an alpha-helical barrel. This barrel is unusual because it consists of only four helices rather than six found in all other terpene synthases. Mutagenesis establishes that this barrel is essential for the terpene synthase activity of CYP170A1 but not for the monooxygenase activity. This is the first bifunctional P450 discovered to have another active site moonlighting on it and the first time a terpene synthase active site is found moonlighting on another protein.",

The product of one of the two predicted CYP genes (YP_143162) showed low-level homology to sterol 14-demethylase (CYP51) and contained a C-terminal polypeptide domain of unknown function. YP_143162 expression (without an N-terminal membrane binding domain) in Escherichia coli yields a CYP protein which gives a reduced CO difference maximum at 448 nm and was formally demonstrated as the first viral cytochrome P450. Analysis of binding of lipid and sterol substrates indicated no perturbation in CYP heme environment, and an absence of activity was seen when 14-methyl sterols were used as a substrate. The function of the CYP protein and its C-terminal domain remain unknown.",

        "Abstract": "The genome sequence of Mycobacterium leprae revealed a single open reading frame, ML2088 (CYP164A1), encoding a putative full-length cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and 12 pseudogenes. We have identified a homolog of ML2088 in Mycobacterium smegmatis and report here the cloning, expression, purification, and azole-binding characteristics of this cytochrome P450 (CYP164A2). CYP164A2 is 1,245 bp long and encodes a protein of 414 amino acids and molecular mass of 45 kDa. CYP164A2 has 60% identity with Mycobacterium leprae CYP161A1 and 66 to 69% identity with eight other mycobacterial CYP164A1 homologs, with three identified highly conserved motifs. Recombinant CYP164A2 has the typical spectral characteristics of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, predominantly in the ferric low-spin state. Unusually, the spin state was readily modulated by increasing ionic strength at pH 7.5, with 50% high-spin occupancy achieved with 0.14 M NaCl. CYP164A2 bound clotrimazole, econazole, and miconazole strongly (K(d), 1.2 to 2.5 muM); however, strong binding with itraconazole, ketoconazole, and voriconazole was only observed in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl. Fluconazole did not bind to CYP164A2 at pH 7.5 and no discernible type II binding spectrum was observed.",

        "Abstract": "Phanerochaete chrysosporium was the first fungal genome to exhibit more than one hundred cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes for a fungus within its genome (approximately 150). It can metabolize lignocellulose and a wide range of environmental xenobiotics including many carcinogens and pollutants where cytochromes P450 may be involved. In the present paper we describe the heterologous expression and characterization of an ancestral CYP form, sterol 14alpha-demethylase (CYP51-EC1.14.13.70), from this organism. CYP51 was cloned from a cDNA library and expressed in both Escherichia coli, where it exhibited high affinity for azole antifungals, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Proof of function was observed by complementation of a conditional knock-down mutant of yeast CYP51. The CYP51 gene was found to be 1956 bases long and contained 7 exons and 6 introns coding for a polypeptide 550 amino acids long (62 kDa). The CYP51 protein exhibited high affinity (k (d) 0.25-0.45 microM) for azole antifungal compounds.",

Against C. albicans the new imidazoles showed minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) comparable to those of ketoconazole, miconazole, and econazole, and were more potent than fluconazole. Several derivatives ( 10, 12, 14, 18- 20, 24, 28, 29, 30, and 34) turned out to be potent inhibitors of C. albicans strains resistant to fluconazole, with MIC values less than 10 microg/mL. Against dermatophytes strains, compounds 20, 25, and 33 (MIC <or= 5 microg/mL) were equipotent to ketoconazole, econazole, and miconazole. SARs of imidazoles 10- 44 were rationalized with reasonable accuracy by a previously developed quantitative pharmacophore for antifungal agents.",

        "Abstract": "Asthma affects 300 million people worldwide and continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Disease relevant animal models of asthma are required for benchmarking of novel therapeutic mechanisms in comparison to established clinical approaches. We demonstrate that chronic exposure of mice to house dust mite (HDM) extract results in allergic airway inflammation, that can be significantly attenuated by therapeutic intervention with phosphodiesterase 4 inhibition and corticosteroid treatment. Female BALB/c mice were administered intranasally with HDM (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) extract daily for five weeks, and therapeutic intervention with anti-inflammatory treatment (dexamethasone 1 mg/kg subcutaneous once daily, prednisolone 10mg/kg orally twice daily, fluticasone 3, 10 and 30 microg intranasally twice daily, roflumilast 10 mg/kg orally twice daily and intranasally 10 and 30 microg twice daily) was initiated after three weeks of exposure. Chronic HDM extract exposure resulted in significant airway inflammation, demonstrated by bronchoalveolar lavage cell infiltration and lung tissue inflammatory gene expression by TaqMan low density array. Chronic steroid treatment significantly inhibited these parameters. In addition, roflumilast caused a significant reduction in airway inflammatory cell infiltration. We have demonstrated that chronic HDM-induced allergic inflammation can be significantly ameliorated by steroid treatment, and that phosphodiesterase 4 inhibition modulates inflammatory cell infiltration. Therefore, the murine HDM model may be a useful tool for evaluating new targets for the treatment of asthma.",

        "Abstract": "Cytochrome P450 170A1 (CYP170A1) is encoded by the sco5223 gene of the Gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) as part of a two-gene cluster with the sco5222 gene. The SCO5222 protein is a sesquiterpene synthase that catalyzes the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to the novel tricyclic hydrocarbon, epi-isozizaene (Lin, X., Hopson, R., and Cane, D. E. (2006) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 128, 6022-6023). The presence of CYP170A1 (sco5223) suggested that epiisozizaene might be further oxidized by the transcriptionally coupled P450. We have now established that purified CYP170A1 carries out two sequential allylic oxidations to convert epi-isozizaene to an epimeric mixture of albaflavenols and thence to the sesquiterpene antibiotic albaflavenone. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of S. coelicolor culture extracts established the presence of albaflavenone in the wild-type strain, along with its precursors epi-isozizaene and the albaflavenols. Disruption of the CYP170A1 gene abolished biosynthesis of both albaflavenone and the albaflavenols, but not epi-isozizaene. The combined results establish for the first time the presence of albaflavenone in S. coelicolor and clearly demonstrate that the biosynthesis of this antibiotic involves the coupled action of epi-isozizaene synthase and CYP170A1.",

        "Title": "Prostate cancer: the new evidence base for diagnosis and treatment.",
        "Abstract": "Although prostate cancer (PC) has a significant mortality, there is debate regarding the utility of PC screening. This debate continues as major studies investigating the value of population-based screening have yet to be concluded. Despite this, there is increasing evidence from preliminary reports from these series, as well as numerous others relating to outcome prediction for PC, that early detection leads to improved outcomes and a decrease in the burden of metastatic disease on our healthcare system. PC is rarely symptomatic until it has metastasised to bone and because of this PSA-based screening remains the only widely available and reliable method of diagnosis for organ-confined disease. There is now compelling evidence to show that: 1. Cancers diagnosed by screening are more likely to be early stage, when most can be cured by a number of different treatment options. 2. The maximum benefits of screening are for men aged 50-70 years. Older men have a greater chance of a clinically insignificant cancer being diagnosed for which treatment is not necessary. 3. The familial risks of PC are well recognised. In particular, men with one or more first-degree relatives already diagnosed with the disease should be actively encouraged to undergo screening. 4. Modern histopathological assessment of fine core needle biopsies of the prostate allows for the likely behaviour of cancer present to be accurately predicted. Changes that mimic those of malignancy can be confidently identified, so these cases are no longer incorrectly diagnosed. These improvements mean that now most men aged 50-70 years diagnosed with PC will have clinically significant cancers that require treatment.",

Many laboratories, however, do not have a dedicated instrument for the NASBA assay. This study aimed to evaluate the use of the Roche LightCycler as a platform for performing the NASBA assay for detection of EV. A diverse subgenera of EV were used to assess the specificity of the NASBA assay, including coxsackie, echovirus, poliovirus, and other enteroviruses together with related and unrelated viruses, including rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, herpes simplex virus, adenovirus, influenza virus A, and cytomegalovirus. All species of EV tested were successfully detected using NASBA and no cross reactivity with other viruses was observed. Using serial dilutions of EV to assess sensitivity, the NASBA assay was compared to an in-house EV RT-PCR assay. The NASBA assay demonstrated a higher level of sensitivity. Fifty-one clinical samples positive for EV by viral culture were also evaluated. All NASBA results obtained were concordant with viral culture results. This study confirmed that the NASBA assay for the detection of EV could be readily performed on the LightCycler and easily incorporated into the workflow of a diagnostic laboratory equipped with a LightCycler, thereby eliminating the need for additional instrumentation.",

        "Title": "Woody species diversity influences productivity and soil nutrient availability in tropical plantations.",
        "Abstract": "We investigated the relationship between plant diversity and ecological function (production and nutrient cycling) in tropical tree plantations. Old plantations (65-72 years) of four different species, namely Araucaria cunninghamii, Agathis robusta, Toona ciliata and Flindersia brayleyana, as well as natural secondary forest were examined at Wongabel State Forest, in the wet tropics region of Queensland, Australia. Two young plantations (23 years) of Araucaria cunninghamii and Pinus caribaea were also examined. The close proximity of the older plantations and natural forests meant they had similar edaphic and climatic conditions. All plantations had been established as monocultures, but had been colonised by a range of native woody plants from the nearby rainforest. The extent to which this had occurred varied with the identity of the plantation species (from 2 to 17 species in 0.1 ha blocks). In many cases these additional species had grown up and joined the forest canopy. This study is one of the few to find a negative relationship between overstorey plant diversity and productivity. The conversion of natural forest with highly productive, low-diversity gymnosperm-dominated plantations (young and old Araucaria cunninghamii and Pinus caribaea) was found to be associated with lower soil nutrient availability (approximately five times less phosphorus and 2.5 times less nitrogen) and lower soil pH (mean=6.28) compared to the other, less productive plantations. The dominant effects of two species, Araucaria cunninghamii and Hodgkinsonia frutescens, indicate that ecosystem functions such as production and nutrient availability are not determined solely by the number of species, but are more likely to be determined by the characteristics of the species present. This suggests that monoculture plantations can be used to successfully restore some functions (e.g. nutrient cycling and production), but that the level to which such functions can be restored will depend upon the species chosen and site conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies have shown an association between atherosclerosis, Heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, and Hsp antibody titres. We aimed to investigate the time course of appearance of Hsp-60, -65 and -70 antibodies in the cholesterol-fed rabbit and to relate antibody titres to serum concentrations of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a marker of endothelial injury. Rabbits were fed with 0.25-1.0% cholesterol diet for 13 weeks. Plasma levels of anti Hsp-60, -65 and -70 IgG titres, were measured using in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) together with plasma vWF concentrations. Plasma titres of anti-Hsp-60, -65 and -70 antibodies were all significantly increased by weeks 5, 7 and 9 following commencement of the experimental diet compared with baseline (P < 0.05 for all). In non-cholesterol-fed rabbits, plasma levels of anti-Hsp titres were unchanged over this period. Increased plasma vWF concentrations were also found in the cholesterol-fed rabbits, reaching a maximum at approximately week 8, and falling thereafter. Furthermore, plasma vWF concentrations at 13 weeks correlated strongly with antibody titres to all three Hsps (r = 0.90, P = 0.002; r = 0.80, P = 0.017; r = 0.86, P = 0.006 for Hsp 60, -65 and -70 respectively) and titres were also strongly correlated with final plasma cholesterol concentrations in cholesterol-fed animals (r = 0.95, P = 0.002; r = 0.8, P = 0.001; r = 0.84, P = 0.01 respectively). In cholesterol-fed rabbits, antibody titres to Hsp-60, -65 and -70 appear to rise in association with a marker of endothelial injury, peaking at approximately the same time (8 weeks) after starting a high cholesterol diet.",

        "Title": "Different binding modes of two flaviolin substrate molecules in cytochrome P450 158A1 (CYP158A1) compared to CYP158A2.",
        "Abstract": "Cytochrome P450 158A2 (CYP158A2) has been shown to catalyze an unusual oxidative C-C coupling reaction to polymerize flaviolin and form highly conjugated pigments (three isomers of biflaviolin and one triflaviolin) in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) which protect the soil bacterium from deleterious effects of UV irradiation (Zhao B. et al. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 11599-11607). The present studies demonstrate that the subfamily partner CYP158A1, sharing 61% amino acid identity with CYP158A2, can also catalyze the same flaviolin dimerization reactions, but it generates just two of the three isomers of biflaviolin that CYP158A2 produces. Furthermore, the two CYP158A1 products have very different molar ratios compared with the corresponding CYP158A2 products, indicating that each enzyme maintains its own stereo- and regiospecificity. To find an explanation for these differences, three CYP158A1 structures have been solved by X-ray crystallography and have been compared with those for CYP158A2. The structures reveal surprising differences. Particularly, only one flaviolin molecule is present close to the heme iron in CYP158A1, and the second flaviolin molecule binds at the entrance of the putative substrate access channel on the protein distal surface 9 A away. Our work describes two members of the same P450 subfamily, which produce the same products by oxidative C-C coupling yet show very different structural orientations of substrate molecules in the active site.",

        "Abstract": "A putative operon containing homologues of essential eukaryotic sterol biosynthetic enzymes, squalene monooxygenase and oxidosqualene cyclase, has been identified in the genome of the prokaryote Methylococcus capsulatus. Expression of the squalene monooxygenase yielded a protein associated with the membrane fraction, while expression of oxidosqualene cyclase yielded a soluble protein, contrasting with the eukaryotic enzyme forms. Activity studies with purified squalene monooxygenase revealed a catalytic activity in epoxidation of 0.35 nmol oxidosqualene produced/min/nmol squalene monooxygenase, while oxidosqualene cyclase catalytic activity revealed cyclization of oxidosqualene to lanosterol with 0.6 nmol lanosterol produced/min/nmol oxidosqualene cyclase and no other products observed. The presence of prokaryotic sterol biosynthesis is still regarded as rare, and these are the first representatives of such prokaryotic enzymes to be studied, providing new insight into the evolution of sterol biosynthesis in general.",

        "Abstract": "Serum CRP concentrations are elevated in subjects at risk of coronary events and in subjects with metabolic syndrome. Although dietary fat and antioxidants are known for their immune-modulating actions, their reported effects on CRP concentrations have been inconsistent. In the present study we have investigated whether dietary constituents are associated with serum CRP concentrations in healthy subjects and patients with dyslipidaemic. Dyslipidaemic subjects (n=238) were recruited from Hospital Outpatient Clinics in Guilford, UK. Apparently healthy subjects (n=188) were recruited from amongst adjacent University and Hospital employees. A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to estimate dietary intake. Dyslipidaemic patients had higher serum CRP [1.25 (0.42-3.26) mg/L] than control subjects [0.50 (0.17-1.42) mg/L] (p<0.001). In the dyslipidaemic patients, approximately 4% of the variation in serum CRP could be explained by dietary cholesterol intake (p = 0.015, 2.8%), and weakly by dietary vitamin C intake (p = 0.06, 1.2%). No relationship between dietary constituents and serum CRP concentrations was found among the healthy subjects. Hence the present study shows that serum CRP concentrations are increased in patients with classical coronary risk factors, and that they may be modulated by dietary cholesterol.",

        "Title": "Electron transport pathway for a Streptomyces cytochrome P450: cytochrome P450 105D5-catalyzed fatty acid hydroxylation in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2).",
        "Abstract": "Streptomyces and other bacterial actinomycete species produce many important natural products, including the majority of known antibiotics, and cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes catalyze important biosynthetic steps. Relatively few electron transport pathways to P450s have been characterized in bacteria, particularly streptomycete species. One of the 18 P450s in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), P450 105D5, was found to bind fatty acids tightly and form hydroxylated products when electrons were delivered from heterologous systems. The six ferredoxin (Fdx) and four flavoprotein Fdx reductase (FDR) proteins coded by genes in S. coelicolor were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and used to characterize the electron transfer pathway. Of the many possibilities, the primary pathway was NADH --> FDR1 --> Fdx4 --> P450 105D5. The genes coding for FDR1, Fdx4, and P450 105D5 are located close together in the S. coelicolor genome. Several fatty acids examined were substrates, including those found in S. coelicolor extracts, and all yielded several products. Mass spectra of the products of lauric acid imply the 8-, 9-, 10-, and 11-hydroxy derivatives. Hydroxylated fatty acids were also detected in vivo in S. coelicolor. Rates of electron transfer between the proteins were measured; all steps were faster than overall hydroxylation and consistent with rates of NADH oxidation. Substrate binding, product release, and oxygen binding were relatively fast in the catalytic cycle; high kinetic deuterium isotope effects for all four lauric acid hydroxylations indicated that the rate of C-H bond breaking is rate-limiting in every case. Thus, an electron transfer pathway to a functional Streptomyces P450 has been established.",

Site-directed mutagenesis of native E(297)QSLW(301) in CYP157C1 to E(297)ESLR(301) or E(297)QSRW(301) both containing standard EXXR motifs produced cytochrome P420 proteins thought to be inactive forms of P450 even though wild type CYP157C1 has the spectral properties of a normal P450. These results indicate that the EXXR motif is not required in all CYP tertiary architectures and only a single cysteine residue, which coordinates as the fifth thiolate ligand to the P450 haem iron, is invariant in all CYPs structures.",

        "Abstract": "One of the surprising discoveries about the genomics of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily is the large number of CYPs in the bacterial class of actinomycetes. It had previously been imagined that bacteria have small numbers of CYPs or none at all. Particularly intriguing is that the bacterial genus Streptomyces, which produce a large number of secondary metabolites with important medical application, has a large CYP complement reflecting the ecological niche that the organism finds itself in. In 2001 the first complete Streptomyces species genome (Streptomyces coelicolor A3[2]) was published, revealing the presence of 18 CYP genes. Subsequently, genomes for Streptomyces avermitilis, with 33 CYPs, and Streptomyces peucetius, with 15 CYPs, have been reported. Although a certain number of these CYPs have known functions in secondary metabolism, as identified biochemically or through gene locus organisation, in the vast majority of Streptomyces species, CYP functions are unknown. The first detailed analysis of the CYP complement from a Streptomyces species genome has begun in the laboratories of Waterman et al. The long-term goal of this effort is to identify orphan CYP function, to establish their high resolution structure and to establish a strategy for producing novel secondary metabolites that have new biomedical function. This chapter provides an overview of CYP systems in Streptomyces species and provides a plan of how new drugs might be generated from streptomycetes by modifying the structure of specific CYPs.",

        "Abstract": "This article describes an evaluation study which assessed the effectiveness of a child injury prevention project in deprived localities. The initiative took place across the Bumley, Pendle and Rossendale Primary Care Trust locality in East Lancashire. Families with children under five years of age living within this locality participated in the study. The intervention consisted of a home safety consultation and the provision and fitting of low-cost safety equipment to 1234 families and their homes within Sure Start programme areas that chose to access the Home Safety Equipment Scheme. In addition to this targeted work in these programme areas, a population-wide education and information campaign was provided across the whole locality. Rates of attendance at an accident and emergency (A&E) department by children aged less than five years of age following an injury were used to assess the outcome of the intervention. Results showed that over two years the proportion of children attending an A&E department reduced at a faster rate in the intervention than in the non-intervention wards, thereby reducing the health inequalities gap. It was therefore concluded that targeted work with parents of young children living in disadvantaged areas, together with the provision and fitting of low-cost safety equipment, can improve health and reduce inequalities among the local under-five population.",

As a test, the FBGA was applied to measuring the speed of the electric wind generated in the particularly harsh, high-voltage environment of a dc, negative-polarity, partial (corona) discharge in atmospheric air. The instrument proved more stable and yielded an order-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity (deltav approximately 4 x 10(-3) ms(-1)) compared with other optical-fiber-based anemometers. On-axis wind speeds ranging from zero to 1.1 m s(-1) were measured in the vicinity of the corona discharge.",

        "Abstract": "NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase transfers two reducing equivalents derived from a hydride ion of NADPH via FAD and FMN to the large family of microsomal cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in one-electron transfer steps. The mechanism of electron transfer by diflavin reductases remains elusive and controversial. Here, we determined the crystal structure of truncated yeast NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, which is functionally active toward its physiological substrate cytochrome P450, and discovered a second FMN binding site at the interface of the connecting and FMN binding domains. The two FMN binding sites have different accessibilities to the bulk solvent and different amino acid environments, suggesting stabilization of different electronic structures of the reduced flavin. Since only one FMN cofactor is required for function, a hypothetical mechanism of electron transfer is discussed that proposes shuttling of a single FMN between these two sites coupled with the transition between two semiquinone forms, neutral (blue) and anionic (red).",

        "Abstract": "The current scale of deforestation in tropical regions and the large areas of degraded lands now present underscore the urgent need for interventions to restore biodiversity, ecological functioning, and the supply of goods and ecological services previously used by poor rural communities. Traditional timber plantations have supplied some goods but have made only minor contributions to fulfilling most of these other objectives. New approaches to reforestation are now emerging, with potential for both overcoming forest degradation and addressing rural poverty.",

        "Abstract": "Patients previously not treated with a lipid-lowering agent (n = 20; mean age 49.15 +/- 3.28 years) were treated with either 10 mg/day of Simvastatin (n = 11), or Atorvastatin (n = 9) for 4 months. Fourteen additional patients were recruited from the same clinic at the same hospital as a control group. The medication of these latter patients was unaltered for 4 months and the same parameters were measured as for the statin groups. Serum concentrations of zinc, copper, caeruloplasmin, selenium, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured together with their lipid profiles pre- and post-treatment. In addition to reducing serum total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (p < 0.0001), statin treatment was associated with a significant reduction in mean serum zinc (9%, p = 0.03), copper (9%, p < 0.01), caeruloplasmin (24%, p < 0.05), and median CRP (45%, p < 0.03). Similar changes were not observed in the control patients. No significant effects were observed for serum selenium, copper/caeruloplasmin ratio, or GPx (p > 0.05) in either statin or control groups. These changes may be related to the known anti-inflammatory properties of the statin class of drugs.",

We evaluated the use of the Directigen Flu A+B in a paediatric hospital laboratory in comparison with the established diagnostic tests direct immunofluorescence, viral culture and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. A total of 193 respiratory specimens were examined and the Directigen test detected positive samples with an 80.8 per cent sensitivity and a specificity of 100 per cent. This study confirms other paediatric studies which have found the Directigen Flu A+B to be less sensitive than traditional laboratory tests but nevertheless to have a potential role in patient management especially when a positive result is obtained.",

        "Abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor is a member of type-I growth factor receptor family with tyrosine kinase activity that is activated following the binding of multiple cognate ligands. Several members of the EGF family of ligands are expressed by cells involved in atherogenesis. EGF receptor mediated processes have been well characterised within epithelial, smooth muscle and tumour cell lines in vitro, and the EGF receptor has been identified immunocytochemically on intimal smooth muscle cells within atherosclerotic plaques. There is also limited evidence for the expression of the EGF receptor family on leukocytes, although their function has yet to be clarified. In this review, we will discuss the biological functions of this receptor and its ligands and their potential to modulate the function of cells involved in the atherosclerotic process.",

        "Title": "Dietary copper supplements modulate aortic superoxide dismutase, nitric oxide and atherosclerosis.",
        "Abstract": "The objective was to test the hypothesis that dietary copper inhibits atherosclerosis by inducing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and potentiating nitric oxide (NO). New Zealand White rabbits were fed either a cholesterol diet (n = 8) or a cholesterol diet containing 0.02% copper acetate (n = 8) for 13 weeks. We found that the intimal area was significantly smaller in the animals supplemented with copper (P < 0.005), although integrated plasma cholesterol levels were not significantly different. This was associated with a significant increase in aortic copper content (P < 0.05), SOD activity (P < 0.05) and Cu/Zn SOD mRNA (P < 0.05) and a significant decrease in nitrotyrosine content (P < 0.05). Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between aortic copper content and SOD activity (P < 0.005, R(2) = 0.83) and a negative correlation between aortic superoxide dimutase activity and nitrotyrosine content (P < 0.005, R(2) = 0.93). In organ bath experiments, the relaxation of precontracted carotid artery rings to calcium ionophore was greater in animals supplemented with copper. No difference in response to sodium nitroprusside was observed. These data suggest that in the cholesterol-fed rabbit, copper supplements inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis by increasing SOD expression, thereby reducing the interaction of NO with superoxide, and hence potentiating NO-mediated pathways that may protect against atherosclerosis.",

        "Abstract": "Meningococcal polysaccharides are medically important molecules and are the active components of vaccines against Neisseria meningiditis serogroups A, C, W135, and Y. This study demonstrates that free solution capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) using simple phosphate/borate separation buffers is capable of separating intact, native polysaccharides from these four serogroups. Separation appeared to be robust with respect to variations in test conditions and behaved in expected ways with respect to changes in temperature, ionic strength, and addition of an organic modifier. Serogroups W135 and Y are composed of sialic acid residues alternating with either galactose or glucose, respectively. Separation of these serogroups could be achieved using phosphate buffer and was therefore not dependent on differential complexation with borate. Addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate to the separation buffer (i.e., MEKC) resulted in peak splitting for all four serogroups. Changes in polysaccharide size did not affect migration time for the size range examined, but serogroup C polysaccharide (a sialic acid homopolymer) was separable from sialic acid monosaccharide. CZE quantification of multiple lots of each of the four serogroups was compared to wet chemical determination by phosphorus or sialic acid measurement. Results from CZE determination showed good agreement with the wet chemical methods.",

        "Abstract": "Cytochrome P450 158A2 (CYP158A2) is encoded within a three-gene operon (sco1206-sco1208) in the prototypic soil bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). This operon is widely conserved among streptomycetes. CYP158A2 has been suggested to produce polymers of flaviolin, a pigment that may protect microbes from UV radiation, in combination with the adjacent rppA gene, which encodes the type III polyketide synthase, 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene synthase. Following cloning, expression, and purification of this cytochrome P450, we have shown that it can produce dimer and trimer products from the substrate flaviolin and that the structures of two of the dimeric products were established using mass spectrometry and multiple NMR methods. A comparison of the x-ray structures of ligand-free (1.75 angstroms) and flaviolin-bound (1.62 angstroms) forms of CYP158A2 demonstrates a major conformational change upon ligand binding that closes the entry into the active site, partly due to repositioning of the F and G helices. Particularly interesting is the presence of two molecules of flaviolin in the closed active site. The flaviolin molecules form a quasi-planar three-molecule stack including the heme of CYP158A2, suggesting that oxidative C-C coupling of these phenolic molecules leads to the production of flaviolin dimers.",

Results indicate that the method exhibits suitable specificity, sensitivity, precision, linearity and accuracy for quantification of residual EDU in the presence of meningococcal polysaccharide-diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine and other vaccine matrix compounds. The assay has been validated for a detection range of 10-100 ng/mL and then successfully transferred to quality control (QC) lab. This same method has also been applied to the determination of residual diaminohexane (DAH) in the presence of EDU. LC-MS/MS has proven to be useful as a quick and sensitive approach for simultaneous determination of multiple residual compounds in glycoconjugate vaccine samples.",

        "Abstract": "It has previously been shown that dietary copper can modulate the extent of atherosclerosis in the thoracic aorta of cholesterol-fed rabbits. The metabolism of copper and zinc are closely related, and it has been hypothesized that the balance of dietary copper to zinc may be important in determining coronary risk. Hence, we have investigated the interaction between dietary copper and zinc in atherogenesis in the New Zealand White rabbit. Juvenile male rabbits were randomly allocated to eight groups. Four groups were fed a normal chow diet with zinc (0.5%, w/w), copper (0.2%, w/w), copper plus zinc or neither in their drinking water for 12 weeks. Four other groups were fed a diet containing 0.25-1% (w/w) cholesterol plus zinc, copper, both or neither. Serum cholesterol of individual animals was maintained at approximately 20 mmol/l. Integrated plasma cholesterol levels were similar for all groups receiving cholesterol and significantly higher than those in the chow-fed groups (P < 0.001). Aortic copper concentrations were higher in the animals receiving cholesterol diets with copper compared to rabbits receiving normal chow and copper (P < 0.001). Aortic zinc content was significantly higher in cholesterol-fed rabbits supplemented with zinc alone or with copper than in those fed cholesterol alone (P < 0.001). Plasma ceruloplasmin concentrations were significantly higher in groups receiving cholesterol, irrespective of their trace element supplementation (P < 0.001). However, trace element supplementation increased the level significantly (P < 0.05). Trace element supplements did not appear to affect erythrocyte superoxide dismutase in the cholesterol-fed animals; however, zinc supplementation was associated with a significant increase in the enzyme in chow-fed animals (P < 0.05). The activity of the enzyme per mg of protein in aortic tissue was higher in animals receiving copper in the presence of cholesterol (P < 0.05) but not significantly so in its absence. Dietary trace element supplementation in cholesterol-fed animals was associated with a significant reduction in aortic lesion area. Plasma thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and FOX concentrations were both significantly higher in the cholesterol-fed rabbits compared with the animals that fed on a chow diet (P < 0.001), and these were reduced significantly by dietary copper or zinc supplementation (P < 0.001). Hence, dietary supplements of copper or zinc at the doses used both inhibited aortic atherogenesis in the cholesterol-fed rabbits, although there was no significant additional effect when given in combination.",

        "Abstract": "The recruitment of peripheral monocytes to the sub-endothelial space, their development into macrophages and subsequent proliferation are critical events during atherosclerosis. Receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF) have been identified on cells of the myeloid lineage, but a role for them in atherogenesis has yet to be described. We have identified functional EGF receptors (EGFR, ErbB1/HER-1) on peripheral blood monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. Uniquely, these receptors were found to mediate both chemotaxis in monocytes and macrophages and proliferation in macrophages. EGFR mRNA was detected in atherosclerotic plaques, but not in morphologically normal aortae and EGFR receptor staining co-localised with macrophage staining in these plaques. The identification of receptors for EGF on peripheral blood monocytes, macrophages and atherosclerotic lesions, together with their transduction of two functionally important cellular events, heightens the potential importance of members of the EGF super-family in atherogenesis and other chronic inflammatory processes.",

        "Abstract": "An immune response to heat shock protein (HSP)-60/65 has recently been implicated in atherogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine whether this effect may be mediated by impairment of endothelial function. Rabbits were injected with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine (n=12) or saline (n=12). A further injection of BCG or saline was administered after 2 weeks. After a further 2 weeks, animals were fed either a 0.25-1% cholesterol diet or a chow diet for 16 weeks. Blood cholesterol levels were maintained at 10-12mmol/l by altering the dietary cholesterol content. Plasma levels of anti-mycobacterial antibodies rose following BCG immunisation, but anti-HSP antibodies developed only in the BCG-immunised, cholesterol-fed rabbits. Aortic endothelium from cholesterol-fed, but not chow-fed, rabbits stained positively for HSP-60, independently of the immunisation protocol. Endothelial function was impaired in the BCG immunised, cholesterol-fed rabbits as measured by acetylcholine-mediated relaxation of isolated non-atherosclerotic carotid artery rings (P<0.05). This impairment was positively associated with the level of plasma anti-HSP-60 antibodies (P<0.01). These results suggest that BCG immunisation impairs endothelial responses, at least in part, by immune responses against mycobacterial and vascular HSP.",

        "Abstract": "The annotated genome of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) revealed 18 cytosolic cytochromes P450 (CYPs) with six ferredoxin (fdx) proteins and two soluble ferredoxin reductases (fpr), their putative electron transport proteins. mRNA expression was observed for all 18 CYPs throughout growth and secondary metabolism, from 3 h after spore germination, and all CYP proteins examined also were present. Expression of members of the fdx complement was detected from the same time point, yet both fpr were detected only at 12 h. Six-hour exposure to dimethylbenzanthracene and benzo[a]pyrene xenobiotics resulted in the absence of some CYP mRNAs and expression of a specific fpr, FR2. This finding and the expression pattern during growth suggested that CYP activity may be regulated by availability of specific reductases. To test this proposal, we expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity five CYPs: CYP105D5 (involved in xenobiotic metabolism) and CYP154A1, CYP154C1, CYP158A1, and CYP158A2 (putatively involved in secondary metabolism). Also the two soluble fpr (FR2 and FR3) proposed to shuttle electrons by means of fdx were purified, and specific interactions were observed so that FR2 preferentially reduced CYP105D5 (>90% reduction) compared with the other CYPs (>20% reduction), whereas FR3 preferentially reduced the other CYPs (>85% reduction) compared with CYP105D5 (>10%). Furthermore FR2 was shown to efficiently bind CYP105D5 and drive benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylation in contrast to FR3. These data show that control of CYP activity in S. coelicolor A3(2) involves specific interactions with fpr and their availability during the life cycle and, after xenobiotic exposure, represents a unique mechanism for regulating CYP function.",

        "Abstract": "The genus Streptomyces produces two-thirds of microbially derived antibiotics. Polyketides form the largest and most diverse group of these natural products. Antibiotic diversity of polyketides is generated during their biosynthesis by several means, including postpolyketide modification performed by oxidoreductases, a broad group of enzymes including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs). CYPs catalyze site-specific oxidation of macrolide antibiotic precursors significantly affecting antibiotic activity. Efficient manipulation of Streptomyces CYPs in generating new antibiotics will require identification and/or engineering of monooxygenases with activities toward a diverse array of chemical substrates. To begin to link structure to function of CYPs involved in secondary metabolic pathways of industrially important species, we determined the X-ray structure of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) CYP154A1 at 1.85 A and analyzed it in the context of the closely related CYP154C1 and more distant CYPs from polyketide synthase (EryF) and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (OxyB) biosynthetic pathways. In contrast to CYP154C1, CYP154A1 reveals an active site inaccessible from the molecular surface, and an absence of catalytic activities observed for CYP154C1. Systematic variations in the amino acid patterns and length of the surface HI loop correlate with degree of rotation of the F and G helices relative to the active site in CYP154A1-related CYPs, presumably regulating the degree of active site accessibility and its dimensions. Heme in CYP154A1 is in a 180 degrees flipped orientation compared with most other structurally determined CYPs.",

        "Title": "The biodiversity of microbial cytochromes P450.",
        "Abstract": "The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of genes and proteins are well known for their involvement in pharmacology and toxicology, but also increasingly for their importance and diversity in microbes. The extent of diversity has only recently become apparent with the emergence of data from whole genome sequencing projects and the coming years will reveal even more information on the diversity in microbial eukaryotes. This review seeks to describe the historical development of these studies and to highlight the importance of the genes and proteins. CYPs are deeply involved in the development of strategies for deterrence and attraction as well as detoxification. As such, there is intense interest in pathways of secondary metabolism that include CYPs in oxidative tailoring of antibiotics, sometimes influencing potency as bioactive compounds. Further to this is interest in CYPs in metabolism of xenobiotics for use as carbon sources for microbial growth and as biotransformation agents or in bioremediation. CYPs are also current and potential drug targets; compounds inhibiting CYP are antifungal and anti-protozoan agents, and potentially similar compounds may be useful against some bacterial diseases such as tuberculosis. Of note is the diversity of CYP requirements within an organism, ranging from Escherichia coli that has no CYPs as in many bacteria, to Mycobacterium smegmatis that has 40 representing 1% of coding genes. The basidiomycete fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium surprised all when it was found to contain a hundred or more CYPs. The functional genomic investigation of these orphan CYPs is a major challenge for the future.",

One mechanism, observed first in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was through defective sterol C5-desaturase (Erg3p) required to form the fungistatic sterol end-product resulting from CYP51 inhibition, 14alpha-methylergosta-8,24(28)-dien-3beta,6alpha-diol. Here, we report molecular changes resulting in both blocked mutants and also leaky mutants in which reduced ergosterol levels were detected. Blocked mutants exhibited nonsense and frameshift mutations, while leaky mutants contained missense mutations that were generally in conserved positions based on the alignment of sterol C5-desaturases and located mainly between residues 250 and 282.",

The newly completed genome sequence of the avermectin-producing bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis contains 33 cytochromes p450 (CYPs), many more than the 18 observed in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Some of the likely metabolic functions are reported together with their genomic location and bioinformatic analysis. Seven entirely new CYP families were found together with close homologues of some forms observed in S. coelicolor A3(2). The presence of unusual CYP forms associated with conservons is revealed and of these, CYP157 forms in both S. avermitilis and S. coelicolor A3(2) deviate from the previously accepted rule for an EXXR motif within the K-helix of CYPs. Amongst this range of CYPs are forms associated with avermectin, filipin, geosmin, and pentalenolactone biosynthesis as well as unknown pathways of secondary metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "Oxidised low density lipoprotein (LDL) may play a role in atherogenesis. We have investigated some of the mechanisms by which the thiol cysteine and the disulphide cystine can influence the oxidation of LDL by copper ions. Cysteine or cystine (100 microM) inhibited the oxidation of native LDL by copper in a simple phosphate buffer. One of the mechanisms by which cysteine (or more likely its oxidation products in the presence of copper) and cystine inhibited LDL oxidation was by decreasing the binding of copper to LDL (97% inhibition). Cysteine, but not cystine, rapidly reduced Cu(2+) to Cu(+). This may help to explain the antioxidant effect of cysteine as it may limit the amount of Cu(2+) that is available to convert alpha-tocopherol in LDL into the prooxidant alpha-tocopherol radical. Cysteine (but not cystine) had a prooxidant effect, however, toward partially oxidised LDL in the presence of a low copper concentration, which may have been due to the rapid breakdown of lipid hydroperoxides in partially oxidised LDL by Cu(+) generated by cysteine. To prove that cysteine can cause the rapid breakdown of lipid hydroperoxides in LDL, we enriched LDL with lipid hydroperoxides using an azo initiator in the absence of copper. Cysteine, but not cystine, increased the rate of lipid hydroperoxide decomposition to thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in the presence of copper.",

        "Abstract": "Atherosclerosis has long been recognised as having an inflammatory component, and this has a particularly important bearing on to its clinical complications as it may result in plaque instability. Results of recent epidemiological studies have reinforced the potential importance of this aspect of the disease. Positive associations have been reported between exposure to several specific pathogens, and future risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Whilst it is possible that each individual organism contributes to this susceptibility by a different mechanism, it is more likely that one or more common mechanism(s) exist. One possible hypothesis is that an immune response mounted against antigens on pathogenic organisms cross-react with homologous host proteins in a form of 'molecular mimicry'. A group of protein candidates that may be implicated in this process are the stress-induced proteins collectively known as heat shock proteins (HSP). HSPs are expressed and/or secreted by several pathogens, principally Chlamydia pneumoniae and Helicobacter pylori, but are also elaborated by mammalian vascular cells exposed to the stress associated with reperfusion injury or acute hypertension. The HSPs are also expressed by cells within atherosclerotic plaques. Serum titres of anti-HSP antibodies have been reported to be positively related to future risk of CHD. In addition, purified anti-HSP antibodies recognise and mediate the lysis of stressed human endothelial cells and macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, immunisation with HSP exacerbates atherosclerosis in experimental animal models. Some human vaccines, such as BCG, contain HSPs, hence although vaccination programmes are vital for maintaining 'herd' immunity and the prevention of serious infectious disease, they may leave a legacy of increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis. Development of HSP-free vaccines could satisfy the twin goals of protection from infection and reduced incidence of coronary disease.",

        "Abstract": "With a view to their use in cancer therapy, we have produced rat monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against 5 distinct epitopes (A-E) on the external domain of the wild-type human EGF receptor (EGFR). Here, we have investigated the relative binding and anti-tumour activity of our anti-EGFR MAbs against HC2 20d2/c cells, which have been engineered to overexpress the type-III mutated form of the human EGFR (EGFRvIII). We found that anti-EGFR MAbs that are the most effective antagonists of EGFR ligands (e.g., ICR16, ICR62 and ICR80) also bind to cells that overexpress the EGFRvIII. Although these antibodies are potent inhibitors of the growth of cells which express wild-type EGFR, they did not directly inhibit the growth in vitro of EGFRvIII expressing HC2 20d2/c cells, or the constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of this receptor. However, in the presence of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), the rat IgG2b MAb ICR62 induced strong antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against HC2 20d2/c cells in culture. Interestingly, MAb ICR62 also inhibited very effectively experimental lung metastases of HC2 20d2/c cells in athymic nude mice. Our results suggest that anti-EGFR MAb ICR62, which binds to the EGFRvIII, may have potential in the treatment of tumors which overexpress the EGFRvIII via immunological mechanisms such as ADCC. Since tumours that are EGFRvIII positive may also overexpress the wild-type EGFR, the use of anti-EGFR MAbs that target both wild-type and mutant receptors may have advantages over those that target only1form.",

        "Abstract": "The detection of a large variety of viruses requires a number of different susceptible cell lines in a shell vial method--currently considered to be the most enhanced method of viral detection. However, this method is unsuitable in its standard form for handling a large volume of specimens. We have developed a time and cost saving new method, named rapid enhanced tissue culture immunofluorescence (RETCIF) and incorporates the attributes of the current methods. It is specific, uses the most sensitive cell lines and monoclonal antibodies and does not require the use of cover slips. The RETCIF method, in our hands, is a time saving procedure, with higher isolation ratio than the shell vial method. We recommend the RETCIF method for busy diagnostic virology laboratories.",

        "Abstract": "The genetic locus encoding cytochrome P450 51 (CYP51; P450(14DM)) in Mycobacterium smegmatis is described here together with confirmation of activity in lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylation. The protein bound azole antifungals with high affinity and the rank order based on affinity matched the ranked order for microbiological sensitivity of the organism, thus supporting a possible role for CYP51 as a target in the antimycobacterial activity of these compounds. Non-saponifiable lipids were extracted from the bacteria grown on minimal medium. Unlike a previous report using growth on complex medium, no cholesterol was detected in two strains of M. smegmatis, but a novel lipid was detected. The genetic locus of CYP51 is discussed in relation to function; it is conserved as part of a putative operon in M. smegmatis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium, and Mycobacterium bovis and consists of six open-reading frames including two CYPs and a ferredoxin under a putative Tet-R regulated promoter.",

        "Abstract": "Evolutionary links between cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, a superfamily of extraordinarily divergent heme-thiolate proteins catalyzing a wide array of NADPH/NADH- and O(2)-dependent reactions, are becoming better understood because of availability of an increasing number of fully sequenced genomes. Among other reactions, P450s catalyze the site-specific oxidation of the precursors to macrolide antibiotics in the genus Streptomyces introducing regiochemical diversity into the macrolide ring system, thereby significantly increasing antibiotic activity. Developing effective uses for Streptomyces enzymes in biosynthetic processes and bioremediation requires identification and engineering of additional monooxygenases with activities toward a diverse array of small molecules. To elucidate the molecular basis for substrate specificity of oxidative enzymes toward macrolide antibiotics, the x-ray structure of CYP154C1 from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) was determined (Protein Data Bank code ). Relocation of certain common P450 secondary structure elements, along with a novel structural feature involving an additional beta-strand transforming the five-stranded beta-sheet into a six-stranded variant, creates an open cleft-shaped substrate-binding site between the two P450 domains. High sequence similarity to macrolide monooxygenases from other microbial species translates into catalytic activity of CYP154C1 toward both 12- and 14-membered ring macrolactones in vitro.",

        "Abstract": "We examined the impact of single-tree selective logging and fuel reduction burns on the abundance of hollow-nesting bird species at a regional scale in southeastem Queensland, Australia. Data were collected on species abundance and habitat structure of dry sclerophyll production forest at 36 sites with known logging and fire histories. Sixteen bird species were recorded with most being resident, territorial, obligate hollow nesters that used hollows that were either small (< 10 cm diameter) or very large (>18 cm diameter). Species densities were typically low, but combinations of two forest management and three habitat structural variables influenced the abundances of eight bird species in different and sometimes conflicting ways. The results suggest that habitat tree management for biodiversity in production forests cannot depend upon habitat structural characteristics alone. Management histories appear to have independent influence (on some bird species) that are distinguishable from their impacts on habitat structure per se. Rather than managing to maximize species abundances to maintain biodiversity, we may be better off managing to avoid extinctions of populations by identifying thresholds of acceptable fluctuations in populations of not only hollow-nesting birds but other forest dependent wildlife relative to scientifically valid forest management and habitat structural surrogates.",

How a single CPR can drive many CYPs is an important area of study. We have investigated this CPR to gain insight into the mechanistic and structural biodiversity of the cytochrome P450 catalytic system. Native CPR and a NH(2)-terminally truncated derivative lacking 23 amino acids have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Steady-state kinetics of cytochrome c reductase activity revealed a random sequential bireactant kinetic mechanism in which both products form dead-end complexes reflecting differences in CPR kinetic mechanisms even within a single kingdom of life. Removal of the N-terminal anchor of P. chrysosporium CPR did not alter the kinetic properties displayed by the enzyme in vitro, indicating it was a useful modification for structural studies.",

        "Abstract": "Several studies have reported associations between coronary heart disease (CHD) and infection. Recent studies have implicated immune responses to heat shock protein(s) (HSP) as a contributary factor. Using an immunisation model, we have assessed the relationship between the immune responses to HSP and subsequent atherosclerosis. Rabbits were immunised with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine (n=10) or saline (n=10) and subsequently fed a 0.25-1.0% cholesterol diet for 10 weeks. Plasma levels of IgG specific for mycobacterial antigen A60 and human HSP-60, but not for human HSP-70, rose following BCG immunisation, reaching a peak after 8 weeks. The percentage aortic area covered by atherosclerotic plaque was greater in animals immunised with BCG (30.5+/-3.8) compared to saline treated animals (16.4+/-2.6) (P<0.05). Furthermore, the individual titres of anti-HSP-60 in the BCG-immunised animal antibodies at week 8 (prior to starting the cholesterol diet) correlated with the percentage aortic area covered by plaque after 18 weeks (R2=0.72; P<0.05). No correlation was found between anti-A60 antibody titres and plaque area. Antiserum from BCG-immunised, but not control, animals stained heat-shocked endothelial cells. These data suggest that immune responses to HSP may be implicated in the relationship between specific infections and CHD.",

        "Abstract": "Sterol 14alpha-demethylase encoded by CYP51 is a member of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of enzymes and has been shown to have an essential role in sterol biosynthesis in eukaryotes, with orthologues recently being described in some bacteria. Examination of the genome sequence data for the proteobacterium Methylococcus capsulatus, a bacterial species known to produce sterol, revealed the presence of a single CYP with strong homology to CYP51, particularly to a form in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This M. capsulatus CYP51 protein represents a new class of CYP consisting of the CYP domain naturally fused to a ferredoxin domain at the C terminus via an alanine-rich linker. Expression of the M. capsulatus MCCYP51FX fusion in Escherichia coli yielded a P450, which, when purified to homogeneity, had the predicted molecular mass approximately 62 kDa on SDS/PAGE and bound lanosterol as a putative substrate. Sterol 14alpha-demethylase activity was shown (0.24 nmol of lanosterol metabolized per minute per nanomole of MCCYP51FX fusion) by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with the activity dependent upon the presence of ferredoxin reductase and NADPH. Our unique findings describe a new class of naturally existing cytochrome P450, which will provide pivotal information for CYP structure/function in general.",

        "Title": "Effect of dietary copper supplementation on cell composition and apoptosis in atherosclerotic lesions of cholesterol-fed rabbits.",
        "Abstract": "We have previously shown that dietary copper supplementation modulates the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in the cholesterol-fed rabbit. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of copper supplementation on the cellular composition and characteristics of atherosclerotic lesions in cholesterol-fed NZW rabbits. Rabbits received a 1% cholesterol diet with or without 0.02% copper acetate (containing 12 and 0.3 mg copper per 100 g diet, respectively) for 12 weeks. The tunica intima was significantly smaller in the animals receiving copper supplements (0.016+/-0.005 vs. 0.068+/-0.019 mm(2), P<0.05) and this was accompanied by a significant increase in aortic copper content (4.0+/-0.8 vs. 1.8+/-0.2 microg/g tissue, P<0.05). The percentage area staining for smooth muscle cells (HHF-35 positive) was significantly lower in the intima of animals receiving copper supplements (7.13+/-1.02 vs. 9.72+/-0.82%, P<0.05). However, there were no significant differences in area staining for macrophages (RAM-11 positive) between groups (22.6+/-7.9 vs. 23.3+/-4.9%). There were also significantly fewer apoptotic cells (0.96+/-0.33 vs. 2.54+/-0.56%, P<0.005) in the aortic intima from animals supplemented with copper, but no difference in the number of proliferating cells. However, there was a reduction in intimal collagen staining (Sirius red positivity) in the animals receiving a copper supplement. Taken together, these data show that dietary copper can significantly affect the composition and progression of atherosclerotic lesions.",

        "Abstract": "Determining the effect of gene deletion is a fundamental approach to understanding gene function. Conventional genetic screens exhibit biases, and genes contributing to a phenotype are often missed. We systematically constructed a nearly complete collection of gene-deletion mutants (96% of annotated open reading frames, or ORFs) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DNA sequences dubbed 'molecular bar codes' uniquely identify each strain, enabling their growth to be analysed in parallel and the fitness contribution of each gene to be quantitatively assessed by hybridization to high-density oligonucleotide arrays. We show that previously known and new genes are necessary for optimal growth under six well-studied conditions: high salt, sorbitol, galactose, pH 8, minimal medium and nystatin treatment. Less than 7% of genes that exhibit a significant increase in messenger RNA expression are also required for optimal growth in four of the tested conditions. Our results validate the yeast gene-deletion collection as a valuable resource for functional genomics.",

        "Abstract": "The annotation of the genome sequence of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) revealed a cytochrome P450 (CYP) resembling various sterol 14alpha-demethylases (CYP51). The putative CYP open reading frame (SC7E4.20) was cloned with a tetrahistidine tag appended to the C-terminus and expressed in Escherichia coli. Protein purified to electrophoretic homogeneity was observed to bind the 14-methylated sterols lanosterol and 24-methylene-24,25-dihydrolanosterol (24-MDL). Reconstitution experiments with E. coli reductase partners confirmed activity in 14alpha-demethylation for 24-MDL, but not lanosterol. An S. coelicolor A3(2) mutant containing a transposon insertion in the CYP51 gene, which will abolish synthesis of the functional haemoprotein, was isolated as a viable strain, the first time a CYP51 has been identified as non-essential. The role of this CYP in bacteria is intriguing. No sterol product was detected in non-saponifiable cell extracts of the parent S. coelicolor A3(2) strain or of the mutant. S. coelicolor A3(2) CYP51 contains very few of the conserved CYP51 residues and, even though it can catalyse 14alpha-demethylation, it probably has another function in Streptomyces. We propose that it is a member of a new CYP51 subfamily.",

Eighteen cytochromes P450 (CYP) are described, in contrast to the absence of CYPs in Escherichia coli, and the twenty observed in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here we confirm protein identity as cytochromes P450 by heterologous expression in E. coli and measurement of reduced carbon monoxide difference spectra. We also report on their arrangement in the linear chromosome and relatedness to other CYPs in the superfamily. The future development of manipulation of antibiotic pathways and the use of streptomycetes in bioremediation and biotransformations will involve many of the new CYP forms identified here.",

        "Abstract": "During the past three decades azole compounds have been developed as medical and agricultural agents to combat fungal diseases. During the 1980s they were introduced as orally active compounds in medicine and the number of such azole drugs is likely to expand in the near future. They represent a successful strategy for antifungal development, but as the incidence of fungal infection has increased coupled to prolonged use of the drugs, the (almost) inevitable emergence of resistance has occurred. This was after resistance had already been encountered as a serious problem in the field, where a larger number of azole fungicides had been employed commercially. In this review the molecular basis of how azoles work is discussed together with how fungi overcome the inhibitory effect of these compounds: through alterations in the primary target molecule (cytochrome P45051; Erg11p; sterol 14alpha-demethylase); through drug efflux mechanisms and through a suppressor mechanism allowing growth on 14-methylated sterols.

        "Abstract": "In this commentary on the recommendations of the Danish Council of Ethics (DCE) concerning criteria for death it is argued that whilst the DCE is correct in stressing the cultural aspects of death, its adoption of cardiac-oriented criteria raises several problems. There are problems with its notion of a 'death process', which purportedly begins with brain death and ends with cessation of cardiac function, and there are serious problems regarding its commitment to a cardiac-oriented definition whilst permitting transplantation when the heart is still beating.",

        "Abstract": "It has been suggested that soil nitrification is inhibited as a succession develops. This hypothesis was examined in a sub tropical rain forest succession containing five successional stages. Soil mineral nitrogen was measured at the time of collection and after 20 days incubation in the laboratory or field. Sampling was carried out during the wet season and dry season. There was little difference in the ammonium nitrogen concentration at the various sites but increasing amounts of nitrate nitrogen were generally found in each older successional stage.The data show that nitrification inhibition is not an invariable consequence of successional development. Instead the pattern of nitrogen mineralisation is probably related to the overall soil fertility and to the pool of available soil nitrogen.",
