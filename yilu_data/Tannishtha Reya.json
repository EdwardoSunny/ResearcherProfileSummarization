        "Abstract": "A majority of cancer research is focused on defining the cellular and molecular basis of cancer cells and the signals that control oncogenic transformation; as a consequence, we know very little about the dynamic behavior of cancer cells in vivo. To begin to view and understand the mechanisms and interactions that control cancer initiation, growth, and metastatic progression and how these processes are influenced by the microenvironment and the signals derived from it, it is essential to develop strategies that allow imaging of the cancer cells in the context of the living microenvironment. Here, we discuss emerging work designed to visualize how cancer cells function within the microenvironment to discover how these interactions act coordinately to enable aberrant growth and to understand how they could be targeted to design new approaches to intercept the disease.",

        "Abstract": "Myeloid leukemias, diseases marked by aggressiveness and poor outcomes, are frequently triggered by oncogenic translocations. In the case of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) the BCR-ABL fusion initiates chronic phase disease with second hits allowing progression to blast crisis. Although Gleevec has been transformative for CML, blast crisis CML remains relatively drug resistant. Here we show that MSI2-HOXA9, a translocation with an unknown role in cancer, can serve as a second hit in driving bcCML. Compared to BCR-ABL, BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 led to a more aggressive disease ",

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is characterized by extensive resistance to conventional therapies, making clinical management a challenge. Here we map the epigenetic dependencies of cancer stem cells, cells that preferentially evade therapy and drive progression, and identify SWI/SNF complex member SMARCD3 as a regulator of\u00a0pancreatic cancer cells. Although SWI/SNF subunits often act as tumor suppressors, we show that SMARCD3 is amplified in cancer, enriched in pancreatic cancer stem cells and upregulated in the human disease. Diverse genetic mouse models of pancreatic cancer and stage-specific Smarcd3 deletion reveal that Smarcd3 loss preferentially impacts established tumors, improving survival especially in context of chemotherapy. Mechanistically, SMARCD3 acts with FOXA1 to control lipid and fatty acid metabolism, programs associated with therapy resistance and poor prognosis in cancer. These data identify SMARCD3 as an epigenetic modulator responsible for establishing the metabolic landscape in aggressive pancreatic cancer cells and a potential target for new therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Pediatric medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common solid malignant brain neoplasm, with Group 3 (G3) MB representing the most aggressive subgroup. MYC amplification is an independent poor prognostic factor in G3 MB, however, therapeutic targeting of the MYC pathway remains limited and alternative therapies for G3 MB are urgently needed. Here we show that the RNA-binding protein, Musashi-1 (MSI1) is an essential mediator of G3 MB in both MYC-overexpressing mouse models and patient-derived xenografts. MSI1 inhibition abrogates tumor initiation and significantly prolongs survival in both models. We identify binding targets of MSI1 in normal neural and G3 MB stem cells and then cross referenced these data with unbiased large-scale screens at the transcriptomic, translatomic and proteomic levels to systematically dissect its functional role. Comparative integrative multi-omic analyses of these large datasets reveal cancer-selective MSI1-bound targets sharing multiple MYC associated pathways, providing a valuable resource for context-specific therapeutic targeting of G3 MB.",

HSC research is arguably the first quantitative single-cell science and the foundation of adult stem cell biology. Bone marrow transplant is the oldest and most refined technique of regenerative medicine. Here we review the intertwined history of the discovery of HSCs and bone marrow transplant, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of HSC self-renewal, and the use of HSCs and their derivatives for cell therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Despite gains in knowledge of the intrinsic signals governing cancer progression, effective clinical management of cancer remains a challenge. Drug resistance and relapse, pose the greatest barriers to cancer care, and are often driven by the co-option of stem cell programs by subpopulations of aggressive cancer cells. Here, we focus on the role of the microenvironment in the acquisition and/or maintenance of stem cell states in cancer in the context of resistance and metastasis. We further discuss the role of cancer stem cells in immune evasion through the course of metastasis, dormancy, and relapse. Understanding the niche in which cancer stem cells live and the signals that sustain them may lead to new strategies that target them by disrupting microenvironmental support.",

        "Abstract": "Intratumoral heterogeneity is a common feature of many myeloid leukemias and a significant reason for treatment failure and relapse. Thus, identifying the cells responsible for residual disease and leukemia re-growth is critical to better understanding how they are regulated. Here, we show that a knock-in reporter mouse for the stem cell gene Musashi 2 (Msi2) allows identification of leukemia stem cells in aggressive myeloid malignancies, and provides a strategy for defining their core dependencies. Specifically, we carry out a high throughput screen using Msi2-reporter blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (bcCML) and identify several adhesion molecules that are preferentially expressed in therapy resistant bcCML cells and play a key role in bcCML. In particular, we focus on syndecan-1, whose deletion triggers defects in bcCML growth and propagation and markedly improves survival of transplanted mice. Further, live imaging reveals that the spatiotemporal dynamics of leukemia cells are critically dependent on syndecan signaling, as loss of this signal impairs their localization, migration and dissemination to distant sites. Finally, at a molecular level, syndecan loss directly impairs integrin \u03b2",

        "Abstract": "Polyamines are critical elements in mammals, but it remains unknown whether adenosyl methionine decarboxylase (AMD1), a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis, is required for myeloid leukemia. Here, we found that leukemic stem cells (LSCs) were highly differentiated, and leukemia progression was severely impaired in the absence of AMD1 in vivo. AMD1 was highly upregulated as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progressed from the chronic phase to the blast crisis phase, and was associated with the poor prognosis of CML patients. In addition, the pharmacological inhibition of AMD1 by AO476 treatment resulted in a robust reduction of the progression of leukemic cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, AMD1 depletion induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in the differentiation of LSCs via oxidative stress and aberrant activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, which was partially rescued by the addition of polyamine. These results indicate that AMD1 is an essential element in the progression of myeloid leukemia and could be an attractive target for the treatment of the disease.",

        "Abstract": "CD98, which is required for the rapid proliferation of both normal and cancer cells, and MET, the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, are potential targets for therapeutic antitumor Abs. In this study, we report that the antiproliferative activity of a prototype anti-CD98 Ab, UM7F8, is due to Ab-induced membrane-associated ring CH (MARCH) E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated ubiquitination and downregulation of cell surface CD98. MARCH1-mediated ubiquitination of CD98 is required for UM7F8's capacity to reduce CD98 surface expression and its capacity to inhibit the proliferation of murine T cells. Similarly, CD98 ubiquitination is required for UM7F8's capacity to block the colony-forming ability of murine leukemia-initiating cells. To test the potential generality of the paradigm that MARCH E3 ligases can mediate the antiproliferative response to antitumor Abs, we examined the potential effects of MARCH proteins on responses to emibetuzumab, an anti-MET Ab currently in clinical trials for various cancers. We report that MET surface expression is reduced by MARCH1, 4, or 8-mediated ubiquitination and that emibetuzumab-induced MET ubiquitination contributes to its capacity to downregulate MET and inhibit human tumor cell proliferation. Thus, MARCH E3 ligases can act as cofactors for antitumor Abs that target cell surface proteins, suggesting that the MARCH protein repertoire of cells is a determinant of their response to such Abs.",

To distinguish the genomic landscape of ASCP and identify actionable targets for this lethal cancer, we applied DNA content flow cytometry to a series of 15 tumor samples including five patient-derived xenografts (PDX). We interrogated purified sorted tumor fractions from these samples with whole-genome copy-number variant (CNV), whole-exome sequencing, and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) analyses.

        "Abstract": "Aggressive myeloid leukemias such as blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia remain highly lethal. Here we report a genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screen to identify new dependencies in this disease. Among these, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in general, and the double-stranded RBP Staufen2 (Stau2) in particular, emerged as critical regulators of myeloid leukemia. In a newly developed knockout mouse, loss of Stau2 led to a profound decrease in leukemia growth and improved survival in mouse models of the disease. Further, Stau2 was required for growth of primary human blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Finally, integrated analysis of CRISPR, eCLIP and RNA-sequencing identified Stau2 as a regulator of chromatin-binding factors, driving global alterations in histone methylation. Collectively, these data show that in vivo CRISPR screening is an effective tool for defining new regulators of myeloid leukemia progression and identify the double-stranded RBP Stau2 as a critical dependency of myeloid malignancies.",

        "Abstract": "While standard therapies can lead to an initial remission of aggressive cancers, they are often only a transient solution. The resistance and relapse that follows is driven by tumor heterogeneity and therapy-resistant populations that can reinitiate growth and promote disease progression. There is thus a significant need to understand the cell types and signaling pathways that not only contribute to cancer initiation, but also those that confer resistance and drive recurrence. Here, we discuss work showing that stem cells and progenitors may preferentially serve as a cell of origin for cancers, and that cancer stem cells can be key in driving the continued growth and \u00a0functional heterogeneity of established cancers. We also describe emerging evidence for the role of developmental signals in cancer initiation, propagation, and therapy resistance and discuss how targeting these pathways may be of therapeutic value.",

        "Abstract": "Drug resistance and relapse remain key challenges in\u00a0pancreatic cancer. Here, we have used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq, and genome-wide CRISPR analysis to map the molecular dependencies of pancreatic cancer stem cells, highly therapy-resistant cells that preferentially drive tumorigenesis and progression. This integrated genomic approach revealed an unexpected utilization of immuno-regulatory signals by pancreatic cancer epithelial cells. In particular, the nuclear hormone receptor retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (ROR\u03b3), known to drive inflammation and T\u00a0cell differentiation, was upregulated during pancreatic cancer progression, and its genetic or pharmacologic inhibition led to a striking defect in pancreatic cancer growth and a marked improvement in survival. Further, a large-scale retrospective analysis in patients revealed that ROR\u03b3 expression may predict pancreatic cancer aggressiveness, as it positively correlated with advanced disease and metastasis. Collectively, these data identify an orthogonal co-option of immuno-regulatory signals by pancreatic cancer stem cells, suggesting that autoimmune drugs should be evaluated as novel treatment strategies for pancreatic cancer patients.",

The therapy resistance and relapse that are commonly seen are driven in large part by the inherent heterogeneity within cancers that allows drugs to effectively eliminate some, but not all, malignant cells. Here, we focus on the fundamental drivers of this heterogeneity by examining emerging evidence that shows that these traits are often controlled by the disruption of normal cell fate and aberrant adoption of stem cell signals. We discuss how undifferentiated cells are preferentially primed for transformation and often serve as the cell of origin for cancers. We also consider evidence showing that activation of stem cell programmes in cancers can lead to progression, therapy resistance and metastatic growth and that targeting these attributes may enable better control over a difficult disease.",

        "Abstract": "Cell state reprogramming during tumor progression complicates accurate diagnosis, compromises therapeutic effectiveness, and fuels metastatic dissemination. We used chromatin accessibility assays and transcriptional profiling during mammary development as an agnostic approach to identify factors that mediate cancer cell state interconversions. We show that fetal and adult basal cells share epigenetic features consistent with multi-lineage differentiation potential. We find that DNA-binding motifs for SOX transcription factors are enriched in chromatin that is accessible in stem/progenitor cells and inaccessible in differentiated cells. In both mouse and human tumors, SOX10 expression correlates with stem/progenitor identity, dedifferentiation, and invasive characteristics. Strikingly, we demonstrate that SOX10 binds to genes that regulate neural crest cell identity, and that SOX10-positive tumor cells exhibit neural crest cell features.",

Under aerobic conditions, glucose is generally assumed to be burned fully by tissues via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) to carbon dioxide. Alternatively, glucose can be catabolized anaerobically via glycolysis to lactate, which is itself also a potential nutrient for tissues and tumours. The quantitative relevance of circulating lactate or other metabolic intermediates as fuels remains unclear. Here we systematically examine the fluxes of circulating metabolites in mice, and find that lactate can be a primary source of carbon for the TCA cycle and thus of energy. Intravenous infusions of ",

        "Abstract": "Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is an aggressive disease associated with drug resistance and relapse. To improve therapeutic strategies, it is critical to better understand the mechanisms that underlie AML progression. Here we show that the integrin binding glycoprotein CD98 plays a central role in AML. CD98 promotes AML propagation and lethality by driving engagement of leukemia cells with their microenvironment and maintaining leukemic stem cells. Further, delivery of a humanized anti-CD98 antibody blocks growth of patient-derived AML, highlighting the importance of this pathway in human disease. These findings indicate that microenvironmental interactions are key regulators of AML and that disrupting these signals with targeted inhibitors such as CD98 antibodies may be a valuable therapeutic approach for adults and children with this disease.",

        "Abstract": "Although we know a great deal about the phenotype and function of haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, a major challenge has been mapping their dynamic behaviour within living systems. Here we describe a strategy to image cells in vivo with high spatial and temporal resolution, and quantify their interactions using a high-throughput computational approach. Using these tools, and a new Msi2 reporter model, we show that haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells display preferential spatial affinity for contacting the vascular niche, and a temporal affinity for making stable associations with these cells. These preferences are markedly diminished as cells mature, suggesting that programs that control differentiation state are key determinants of spatiotemporal behaviour, and thus dictate the signals a cell receives from specific microenvironmental domains. These collectively demonstrate that high-resolution imaging coupled with computational analysis can provide new biological insight, and may in the long term enable creation of a dynamic atlas of cells within their native microenvironment.",

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is a pre-malignant lesion that can progress to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, a highly lethal malignancy marked by its late stage at clinical presentation and profound drug resistance. The genomic alterations that commonly occur in pancreatic cancer include activation of KRAS2 and inactivation of p53 and SMAD4 (refs 2-4). So far, however, it has been challenging to target these pathways therapeutically; thus the search for other key mediators of pancreatic cancer growth remains an important endeavour. Here we show that the stem cell determinant Musashi (Msi) is a critical element of pancreatic cancer progression both in genetic models and in patient-derived xenografts. Specifically, we developed Msi reporter mice that allowed image-based tracking of stem cell signals within cancers, revealing that Msi expression rises as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia progresses to adenocarcinoma, and that Msi-expressing cells are key drivers of pancreatic cancer: they preferentially harbour the capacity to propagate adenocarcinoma, are enriched in circulating tumour cells, and are markedly drug resistant. This population could be effectively targeted by deletion of either Msi1 or Msi2, which led to a striking defect in the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia to adenocarcinoma and an improvement in overall survival. Msi inhibition also blocked the growth of primary patient-derived tumours, suggesting that this signal is required for human disease. To define the translational potential of this work we developed antisense oligonucleotides against Msi; these showed reliable tumour penetration, uptake and target inhibition, and effectively blocked pancreatic cancer growth. Collectively, these studies highlight Msi reporters as a unique tool to identify therapy resistance, and define Msi signalling as a central regulator of pancreatic cancer.",

        "Title": "Delayed Onset of Symptoms Through Feedback Interference in Chronic Cancers.",
        "Abstract": "In many cancers, such as Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), pancreatic, and colorectal cancer, long delays exist between the initiation of the disease and the onset of debilitating symptoms. The early stages of these diseases present manageable symptoms and, in the case of CML, highly effective treatment options. Progression to the more aggressive stages of the diseases limits effective treatment and significantly exacerbates patient prognosis. The mechanisms causing delay and disease progression are largely unknown. The later stages of these diseases are characterized by excessive build up of primitive cell types, indicating a disruption in the normal cell differentiation process that is commonly regulated through feedback from differentiated types. In this study, we propose a mechanism where mutated primitive cells produce a feedback interference signal that desensitizes them to a normal homeostatic feedback. Using a mathematical model, we show that this mechanism can account for the long delay period between occurrence of genetic changes and symptomatic onset characterized by fast growth of cancerous cell population. Finally, we explore novel concepts for potential treatment of chronic cancers.",

        "Abstract": "How a single cell gives rise to an entire organism is one of biology's greatest mysteries. Within this process, stem cells play a key role by serving as seed cells capable of both self-renewal to sustain themselves as well as differentiation to generate the full diversity of mature cells and functional tissues. Understanding how this balance between self-renewal and differentiation is achieved is crucial to defining not only the underpinnings of normal development but also how its subversion can lead to cancer. Musashi, a family of RNA binding proteins discovered originally in Drosophila and named after the iconic samurai, Miyamoto Musashi, has emerged as a key signal that confers and protects the stem cell state across organisms. Here we explore the role of this signal in stem cells and how its reactivation can be a critical element in oncogenesis. Relative to long-established developmental signals such as Wnt, Hedgehog, and Notch, our understanding of Musashi remains in its infancy; yet all evidence suggests that Musashi will emerge as an equally powerful paradigm for regulating development and cancer and may be destined to have a great impact on biology and medicine.",

        "Abstract": "Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer that strikes both adults and children and is frequently resistant to therapy. Thus, identifying signals needed for AML propagation is a critical step toward developing new approaches for treating this disease. Here, we show that Tetraspanin 3 is a target of the RNA binding protein Musashi 2, which plays a key role in AML. We generated Tspan3 knockout mice that were born without overt defects. However, Tspan3 deletion impaired leukemia stem cell self-renewal and disease propagation and markedly improved survival in mouse models of AML. Additionally, Tspan3 inhibition blocked growth of AML patient samples, suggesting that Tspan3 is also important in human disease. As part of the\u00a0mechanism, we show that Tspan3 deficiency disabled responses to CXCL12/SDF-1 and led to defects in AML localization within the niche. These identify Tspan3 as an important regulator of aggressive leukemias and highlight a role for Tspan3 in oncogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Asymmetric division is an evolutionarily conserved process that generates daughter cells with different fates through the unequal partitioning of fate determinants. While asymmetric division is critically important in generating diversity during development, its dysregulation can also promote oncogenesis. In particular, signals that shift the normal balance of symmetric and asymmetric division can lead to a differentiation arrest and trigger cancer progression. Here, we discuss the studies that have provided increasing support for this idea. Beginning with original work carried out in Drosophila, we trace more recent work in mammalian systems that suggest that the subversion of asymmetric division can contribute significantly to the development and progression of both hematologic malignancies and solid cancers.",

        "Abstract": "Metastatic spread is the leading cause of cancer mortality. Breast cancer (BCa) metastatic recurrence can happen years after removal of the primary tumor. Here we show that Ubc13, an E2 enzyme that catalyzes K63-linked protein polyubiquitination, is largely dispensable for primary mammary tumor growth but is required for metastatic spread and lung colonization by BCa cells. Loss of Ubc13 inhibited BCa growth and survival only at metastatic sites. Ubc13 was dispensable for transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2)-induced SMAD activation but was required for activation of non-SMAD signaling via TGF\u03b2-activating kinase 1 (TAK1) and p38, whose activity controls expression of numerous metastasis promoting genes. p38 activation restored metastatic activity to Ubc13-deficient cells, and its pharmacological inhibition attenuated BCa metastasis in mice, suggesting it is a therapeutic option for metastatic BCa.",

        "Abstract": "Accidental or deliberate ionizing radiation exposure can be fatal due to widespread hematopoietic destruction. However, little is known about either the course of injury or the molecular pathways that regulate the subsequent regenerative response. Here we show that the Wnt signaling pathway is critically important for regeneration after radiation-induced injury. Using Wnt reporter mice, we show that radiation triggers activation of Wnt signaling in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. \u03b2-Catenin-deficient mice, which lack the ability to activate canonical Wnt signaling, exhibited impaired hematopoietic stem cell regeneration and bone marrow recovery after radiation. We found that, as part of the mechanism, hematopoietic stem cells lacking \u03b2-catenin fail to suppress the generation of reactive oxygen species and cannot resolve DNA double-strand breaks after radiation. Consistent with the impaired response to radiation, \u03b2-catenin-deficient mice are also unable to recover effectively after chemotherapy. Collectively, these data indicate that regenerative responses to distinct hematopoietic injuries share a genetic dependence on \u03b2-catenin and raise the possibility that modulation of Wnt signaling may be a path to improving bone marrow recovery after damage.",

Here we show that the dynein-binding protein Lis1 is critically required for hematopoietic stem cell function and leukemogenesis. Conditional deletion of Lis1 (also known as Pafah1b1) in the hematopoietic system led to a severe bloodless phenotype, depletion of the stem cell pool and embryonic lethality. Further, real-time imaging revealed that loss of Lis1 caused defects in spindle positioning and inheritance of cell fate determinants, triggering accelerated differentiation. Finally, deletion of Lis1 blocked the propagation of myeloid leukemia and led to a marked improvement in survival, suggesting that Lis1 is also required for oncogenic growth. These data identify a key role for Lis1 in hematopoietic stem cells and mark its directed control of asymmetric division as a critical regulator of normal and malignant hematopoietic development.",

        "Abstract": "One of the most remarkable characteristics of stem cells is their ability to perpetuate themselves through self-renewal while concomitantly generating differentiated cells. In the hematopoietic system, stem cells balance these mechanisms to maintain steady-state hematopoiesis for the lifetime of the organism, and to effectively regenerate the system following injury. Defects in the proper control of self-renewal and differentiation can be potentially devastating and contribute to the development of malignancies. In this review, we trace the emerging role of Wnt signaling as a critical regulator of distinct aspects of self-renewal and differentiation, its contribution to the maintenance of homeostasis and regeneration, and how the pathway can be hijacked to promote leukemia development. A better understanding of these processes could pave the way to enhancing recovery after injury and to developing better therapeutic approaches for hematologic malignancies.",

        "Abstract": "Increased understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms involved in cell survival and cell death signaling pathways offers the promise of harnessing these molecules to eliminate cancer cells without damaging normal cells. Tyrosine kinase oncoproteins promote the genesis of leukemias through both increased cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptotic cell death. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib, have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in the clinic, drug-resistant leukemias emerge in some patients because of either the acquisition of point mutations or amplification of the tyrosine kinase, resulting in a poor long-term prognosis. Here, we exploit the molecular mechanisms of caspase activation and tyrosine kinase/adaptor protein signaling to forge a unique approach for selectively killing leukemic cells through the forcible induction of apoptosis. We have engineered caspase variants that can directly be activated in response to BCR-ABL. Because we harness, rather than inhibit, the activity of leukemogenic kinases to kill transformed cells, this approach selectively eliminates leukemic cells regardless of drug-resistant mutations.",

        "Abstract": "The mechanisms through which the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment regulates hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate remain incompletely understood. We examined the role of the heparin-binding growth factor pleiotrophin (PTN) in regulating HSC function in the niche. PTN(-/-) mice displayed significantly decreased BM HSC content and impaired hematopoietic regeneration following myelosuppression. Conversely, mice lacking protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor zeta, which is inactivated by PTN, displayed significantly increased BM HSC content. Transplant studies revealed that PTN action was not HSC autonomous, but rather was mediated by the BM microenvironment. Interestingly, PTN was differentially expressed and secreted by BM sinusoidal endothelial cells within the vascular niche. Furthermore, systemic administration of anti-PTN antibody in mice substantially impaired both the homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells to the niche and the retention of BM HSCs in the niche. PTN is a secreted component of the BM vascular niche that regulates HSC self-renewal and retention in\u00a0vivo.",

        "Abstract": "\u03b2-Arrestins were initially discovered as negative regulators of G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Although \u03b2-arrestins have more recently been implicated as scaffold proteins that interact with various mitogenic and developmental signals, the genetic role of \u03b2-arrestins in driving oncogenesis is not known. Here we have investigated the role of \u03b2-arrestin in hematologic malignancies and have found that although both \u03b2-arrestin1 and -2 are expressed in the hematopoietic system, loss of \u03b2-arrestin2 preferentially leads to a severe impairment in the establishment and propagation of the chronic and blast crisis phases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). These defects are linked to a reduced frequency, as well as defective self-renewal capacity of the cancer stem-cell population, in mouse models and in human CML patient samples. At a molecular level, the loss of \u03b2-arrestin2 leads to a significant inhibition of \u03b2-catenin stabilization, and ectopic activation of Wnt signaling reverses the defects observed in the \u03b2-arrestin2 mutant cells. These data cumulatively show that \u03b2-arrestin2 is essential for CML disease propagation and indicate that \u03b2-arrestins and the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway lie in a signaling hierarchy in the context of CML cancer stem cell maintenance.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) can progress from a slow growing chronic phase to an aggressive blast crisis phase, but the molecular basis of this transition remains poorly understood. Here we have used mouse models of CML to show that disease progression is regulated by the Musashi-Numb signalling axis. Specifically, we find that the chronic phase is marked by high levels of Numb expression whereas the blast crisis phase has low levels of Numb expression, and that ectopic expression of Numb promotes differentiation and impairs advanced-phase disease in vivo. As a possible explanation for the decreased levels of Numb in the blast crisis phase, we show that NUP98-HOXA9, an oncogene associated with blast crisis CML, can trigger expression of the RNA-binding protein Musashi2 (Msi2), which in turn represses Numb. Notably, loss of Msi2 restores Numb expression and significantly impairs the development and propagation of blast crisis CML in vitro and in vivo. Finally we show that Msi2 expression is not only highly upregulated during human CML progression but is also an early indicator of poorer prognosis. These data show that the Musashi-Numb pathway can control the differentiation of CML cells, and raise the possibility that targeting this pathway may provide a new strategy for the therapy of aggressive leukaemias.",

Systemically administered itraconazole, like other Hh pathway antagonists, can suppress Hh pathway activity and the growth of medulloblastoma in a mouse allograft model and does so at serum levels comparable to those in patients undergoing antifungal therapy. Mechanistically, itraconazole appears to act on the essential Hh pathway component Smoothened (SMO) by a mechanism distinct from that of cyclopamine and other known SMO antagonists, and prevents the ciliary accumulation of SMO normally caused by Hh stimulation.",

        "Abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal is regulated by both intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Although some of the pathways that regulate HSC self-renewal have been uncovered, it remains largely unknown whether these pathways can be triggered by deliverable growth factors to induce HSC growth or regeneration. Here we show that pleiotrophin, a neurite outgrowth factor with no known function in hematopoiesis, efficiently promotes HSC expansion in vitro and HSC regeneration in vivo. Treatment of mouse bone marrow HSCs with pleiotrophin caused a marked increase in long-term repopulating HSC numbers in culture, as measured in competitive repopulating assays. Treatment of human cord blood CD34(+)CDCD38(-)Lin(-) cells with pleiotrophin also substantially increased severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)-repopulating cell counts in culture, compared to input and cytokine-treated cultures. Systemic administration of pleiotrophin to irradiated mice caused a pronounced expansion of bone marrow stem and progenitor cells in vivo, indicating that pleiotrophin is a regenerative growth factor for HSCs. Mechanistically, pleiotrophin activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in HSCs; antagonism of PI3K or Notch signaling inhibited pleiotrophin-mediated expansion of HSCs in culture. We identify the secreted growth factor pleiotrophin as a new regulator of both HSC expansion and regeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Although the role of Hedgehog (Hh) signalling in embryonic pattern formation is well established, its functions in adult tissue renewal and maintenance remain unclear, and the relationship of these functions to cancer development has not been determined. Here we show that the loss of Smoothened (Smo), an essential component of the Hh pathway, impairs haematopoietic stem cell renewal and decreases induction of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) by the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein. Loss of Smo causes depletion of CML stem cells--the cells that propagate the leukaemia--whereas constitutively active Smo augments CML stem cell number and accelerates disease. As a possible mechanism for Smo action, we show that the cell fate determinant Numb, which depletes CML stem cells, is increased in the absence of Smo activity. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of Hh signalling impairs not only the propagation of CML driven by wild-type BCR-ABL1, but also the growth of imatinib-resistant mouse and human CML. These data indicate that Hh pathway activity is required for maintenance of normal and neoplastic stem cells of the haematopoietic system and raise the possibility that the drug resistance and disease recurrence associated with imatinib treatment of CML might be avoided by targeting this essential stem cell maintenance pathway.",

        "Title": "Inhibition of apoptosome formation by suppression of Hsp90beta phosphorylation in tyrosine kinase-induced leukemias.",
        "Abstract": "Constitutively active tyrosine kinases promote leukemogenesis by increasing cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. However, mechanisms underlying apoptotic inhibition have not been fully elucidated. In many settings, apoptosis occurs by mitochondrial cytochrome c release, which nucleates the Apaf-1/caspase-9 apoptosome. Here we report that the leukemogenic kinases, Bcr-Abl, FLT3/D835Y, and Tel-PDGFRbeta, all can inhibit apoptosome function. In cells expressing these kinases, the previously reported apoptosome inhibitor, Hsp90beta, bound strongly to Apaf-1, preventing cytochrome c-induced Apaf-1 oligomerization and caspase-9 recruitment. Hsp90beta interacted weakly with the apoptosome in untransformed cells. While Hsp90beta was phosphorylated at Ser 226/Ser 255 in untransformed cells, phosphorylation was absent in leukemic cells. Expression of mutant Hsp90beta (S226A/S255A), which mimics the hypophosphorylated form in leukemic cells, conferred resistance to cytochrome c-induced apoptosome activation in normal cells, reflecting enhanced binding of nonphosphorylatable Hsp90beta to Apaf-1. In Bcr-Abl-positive mouse bone marrow cells, nonphosphorylatable Hsp90beta expression conferred imatinib (Gleevec) resistance. These data provide an explanation for apoptosome inhibition by activated leukemogenic tyrosine kinases and suggest that alterations in Hsp90beta-apoptosome interactions may contribute to chemoresistance in leukemias.",

        "Abstract": "A fundamental mechanism by which cells can give rise to daughters with different fates is via asymmetric division. During asymmetric division, a mother cell generates daughter cells that go on to adopt different fates because of differential segregation of cell fate determinants. Although originally characterized in invertebrates, asymmetric division has recently been shown to regulate cell fate decisions in the mammalian hematopoietic system, playing crucial roles in stem cell renewal, lymphocyte activation, and leukemogenesis. These discoveries have opened new doors to understanding how regulation of division pattern contributes to the normal development and function of the immune system as well as how its dysregulation can lead to cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Stem cells are thought to balance self-renewal and differentiation through asymmetric and symmetric divisions, but whether such divisions occur during hematopoietic development remains unknown. Using a Notch reporter mouse, in which GFP acts as a sensor for differentiation, we image hematopoietic precursors and show that they undergo both symmetric and asymmetric divisions. In addition we show that the balance between these divisions is not hardwired but responsive to extrinsic and intrinsic cues. Precursors in a prodifferentiation environment preferentially divide asymmetrically, whereas those in a prorenewal environment primarily divide symmetrically. Oncoproteins can also influence division pattern: although BCR-ABL predominantly alters the rate of division and death, NUP98-HOXA9 promotes symmetric division, suggesting that distinct oncogenes subvert different aspects of cellular function. These studies establish a system for tracking division of hematopoietic precursors and show that the balance of symmetric and asymmetric division can be influenced by the microenvironment and subverted by oncogenes.",

Little is known about the intracellular programs that are activated within HSCs during this regenerative process and how this response may be influenced by alterations in signals from the injured microenvironment. Here we have examined the regenerating microenvironment and find that following injury it has an enhanced ability to support HSCs. During this regenerative phase, both hematopoietic and stromal cell elements within the bone marrow microenvironment show increased expression of Wnt10b, which can function to enhance growth of hematopoietic precursors. In addition, regenerating HSCs show increased activation of Wnt signaling, suggesting that microenvironmental changes in Wnt expression after injury may be integrated with the responses of the hematopoietic progenitors. Cumulatively, our data reveal that growth signals in the hematopoietic system are re-activated during injury, and provide novel insight into the influence of the microenvironment during regeneration.",

        "Abstract": "A key characteristic of stem cells and cancer cells is their ability to self-renew. To test if Wnt signaling can regulate the self-renewal of both stem cells and cancer cells in the hematopoietic system, we developed mice that lack beta-catenin in their hematopoietic cells. Here we show that beta-catenin-deficient mice can form HSCs, but that these cells are deficient in long-term growth and maintenance. Moreover, beta-catenin deletion causes a profound reduction in the ability of mice to develop BCR-ABL-induced chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), while allowing progression of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). These studies demonstrate that Wnt signaling is required for the self-renewal of normal and neoplastic stem cells in the hematopoietic system.",

        "Abstract": "Glucose uptake and utilization are growth factor-stimulated processes that are frequently upregulated in cancer cells and that correlate with enhanced cell survival. The mechanism of metabolic protection from apoptosis, however, has been unclear. Here we identify a novel signaling pathway initiated by glucose catabolism that inhibited apoptotic death of growth factor-deprived cells. We show that increased glucose metabolism protected cells against the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bim and attenuated degradation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1. Maintenance of Mcl-1 was critical for this protection, as glucose metabolism failed to protect Mcl-1-deficient cells from apoptosis. Increased glucose metabolism stabilized Mcl-1 in both cell lines and primary lymphocytes via inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha and 3beta (GSK-3alpha/beta), which otherwise promoted Mcl-1 degradation. While a number of kinases can phosphorylate and inhibit GSK-3alpha/beta, we provide evidence that protein kinase C may be stimulated by glucose-induced alterations in diacylglycerol levels or distribution to phosphorylate GSK-3alpha/beta, maintain Mcl-1 levels, and inhibit cell death. These data provide a novel nutrient-sensitive mechanism linking glucose metabolism and Bcl-2 family proteins via GSK-3 that may promote survival of cells with high rates of glucose utilization, such as growth factor-stimulated or cancerous cells.",

        "Abstract": "The hemopoietic microenvironment consists of a diverse repertoire of cells capable of providing signals that influence hemopoietic stem cell function. Although the role of osteoblasts and vascular endothelial cells has recently been characterized, the function of the most abundant cell type in the bone marrow, the adipocyte, is less defined. Given the emergence of a growing number of adipokines, it is possible that these factors may also play a role in regulating hematopoiesis. Here, we investigated the role of adiponectin, a secreted molecule derived from adipocytes, in hemopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. We show that adiponectin is expressed by components of the HSC niche and its receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 are expressed by HSCs. At a functional level, adiponectin influences HSCs by increasing their proliferation, while retaining the cells in a functionally immature state as determined by in vitro and in vivo assays. We also demonstrate that adiponectin signaling is required for optimal HSC proliferation both in vitro and in long term hemopoietic reconstitution in vivo. Finally we show that adiponectin stimulation activates p38 MAPK, and that inhibition of this pathway abrogates adiponectin's proliferative effect on HSCs. These studies collectively identify adiponectin as a novel regulator of HSC function and suggest that it acts through a p38 dependent pathway.",

        "Abstract": "The hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gives rise to all mature, terminally differentiated cells of the blood. Here we show that calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) is present in c-Kit+ ScaI+ Lin(-/low) hematopoietic progenitor cells (KLS cells) and that its absence results in hematopoietic failure, characterized by a diminished KLS cell population and by an inability of these cells to reconstitute blood cells upon serial transplantation. KLS cell failure in the absence of CaMKIV is correlated with increased apoptosis and proliferation of these cells in vivo and in vitro. In turn, these cell biological defects are correlated with decreases in CREB-serine 133 phosphorylation as well as in CREB-binding protein (CBP) and Bcl-2 levels. Re-expression of CaMKIV in Camk4-/- KLS cells results in the rescue of the proliferation defects in vitro as well as in the restoration of CBP and Bcl-2 to wild type levels. These studies show that CaMKIV is a regulator of HSC homeostasis and suggest that its effects may be in part mediated via regulation of CBP and Bcl-2.",

        "Abstract": "A fundamental question in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) biology is how self-renewal is controlled. Here we show that the molecular regulation of two critical elements of self-renewal, inhibition of differentiation and induction of proliferation, can be uncoupled, and we identify Notch signaling as a key factor in inhibiting differentiation. Using transgenic Notch reporter mice, we found that Notch signaling was active in HSCs in vivo and downregulated as HSCs differentiated. Inhibition of Notch signaling led to accelerated differentiation of HSCs in vitro and depletion of HSCs in vivo. Finally, intact Notch signaling was required for Wnt-mediated maintenance of undifferentiated HSCs but not for survival or entry into the cell cycle in vitro. These data suggest that Notch signaling has a dominant function in inhibiting differentiation and provide a model for how HSCs may integrate multiple signals to maintain the stem cell state.",

        "Abstract": "The binding of frizzled (Fzd) receptors by their Wnt ligands results in the inhibition of beta-catenin degradation and subsequent transcription of beta-catenin/LEF-inducible genes. The beta-catenin pathway is known to be involved in development, tumorigenesis, and stem cell self-renewal. In humans, the FZD9 gene lies in the region of chromosome 7q11.23 deleted in the neurodevelopmental disorder, Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS). Fzd9-/- mice show no obvious features of WBS, but reveal a role for Fzd9 in lymphoid development and maturation. Fzd9-/- mice show pronounced splenomegaly, thymic atrophy, and lymphadenopathy with age, with accumulation of plasma cells in lymph nodes. There is a depletion of developing B cells in the bone marrow (BM), particularly in the pre-B stage where immunoglobulin heavy chains are expressed and the cells are undergoing clonal expansion prior to light chain rearrangement. The pre-B defect is partially intrinsic to the hematopoietic system; as in competitive BM reconstitution studies, Fzd9-/- -derived BM exhibits defective B-cell development when implanted into a wild-type host. Mature B cells are present in normal numbers in lymph node and spleen. These findings suggest a role for Fzd9 signaling in lymphoid development, particularly at points where B cells undergo self-renewal prior to further differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "Every day, the body produces billions of new blood cells. Each of these is derived from a rare cell in the bone marrow called the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). Because most mature blood cells have a limited lifespan, the ability of HSCs to self-renew and replenish the mature cell compartment is critical to sustaining life. While great progress has been made in isolating HSCs and defining their functional and phenotypic characteristics, the molecular mechanisms that regulate their self-renewal remain a mystery. Over the last few years, alterations in HSC frequency and self-renewal capacity in transgenic and knock-out mice have led to the identification of novel mediators of HSC homeostasis in vivo. These genetically modified mice have revealed that maintenance of survival, proliferation, quiescence, and normal telomere length all contribute to the self-renewal of HSCs. They also highlight the need to test in context of the normal microenvironment the role of signaling molecules such as Notch and Wnt, which have emerged recently as important regulators of HSC self-renewal. The emerging picture these data provide of the regulation of self-renewal in HSCs has provided a better understanding of the basic biology of stem cells and holds promise for designing strategies to improve bone marrow transplantation.",

Because most mature blood stem cells have a limited life span, the ability of HSCs to perpetuate themselves through self-renewal and generate new blood cells for the lifetime of an organism is critical to sustaining life. A key problem in hematopoietic stem cell biology is how HSC self-renewal is regulated. Recent evidence suggests that signaling pathways classically involved in embryonic development--such as the Wnt signaling pathway--play an important role in regulating stem cell self-renewal. The Wnt signaling pathway has been shown to regulate stem cell fate choice in a variety of organs, including the skin, the nervous system, and the hematopoietic system. In the hematopoietic system, stimulation of hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells with soluble Wnt proteins or downstream activators of the Wnt signaling pathway leads to their expansion. Future studies focusing on the mechanism of action of the Wnt signaling pathway and its interaction with other pathways are needed to gain further insight into the regulation of stem cell self-renewal, not only in the hematopoietic system but also in a variety of other tissues.",

        "Abstract": "Wnt signalling is involved in numerous events in animal development, including the proliferation of stem cells and the specification of the neural crest. Wnt proteins are potentially important reagents in expanding specific cell types, but in contrast to other developmental signalling molecules such as hedgehog proteins and the bone morphogenetic proteins, Wnt proteins have never been isolated in an active form. Although Wnt proteins are secreted from cells, secretion is usually inefficient and previous attempts to characterize Wnt proteins have been hampered by their high degree of insolubility. Here we have isolated active Wnt molecules, including the product of the mouse Wnt3a gene. By mass spectrometry, we found the proteins to be palmitoylated on a conserved cysteine. Enzymatic removal of the palmitate or site-directed and natural mutations of the modified cysteine result in loss of activity, and indicate that the lipid is important for signalling. The purified Wnt3a protein induces self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells, signifying its potential use in tissue engineering.",

        "Abstract": "Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the ability to renew themselves and to give rise to all lineages of the blood; however, the signals that regulate HSC self-renewal remain unclear. Here we show that the Wnt signalling pathway has an important role in this process. Overexpression of activated beta-catenin expands the pool of HSCs in long-term cultures by both phenotype and function. Furthermore, HSCs in their normal microenvironment activate a LEF-1/TCF reporter, which indicates that HCSs respond to Wnt signalling in vivo. To demonstrate the physiological significance of this pathway for HSC proliferation we show that the ectopic expression of axin or a frizzled ligand-binding domain, inhibitors of the Wnt signalling pathway, leads to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced reconstitution in vivo. Furthermore, activation of Wnt signalling in HSCs induces increased expression of HoxB4 and Notch1, genes previously implicated in self-renewal of HSCs. We conclude that the Wnt signalling pathway is critical for normal HSC homeostasis in vitro and in vivo, and provide insight into a potential molecular hierarchy of regulation of HSC development.",
