        "Abstract": "High throughput screening (HTS) is routinely used to identify bioactive small molecules. This requires physical compounds, which limits coverage of accessible chemical space. Computational approaches combined with vast on-demand chemical libraries can access far greater chemical space, provided that the predictive accuracy is sufficient to identify useful molecules. Through the largest and most diverse virtual HTS campaign reported to date, comprising 318 individual projects, we demonstrate that our AtomNet\u00ae convolutional neural network successfully finds novel hits across every major therapeutic area and protein class. We address historical limitations of computational screening by demonstrating success for target proteins without known binders, high-quality X-ray crystal structures, or manual cherry-picking of compounds. We show that the molecules selected by the AtomNet\u00ae model are novel drug-like scaffolds rather than minor modifications to known bioactive compounds. Our empirical results suggest that computational methods can substantially replace HTS as the first step of small-molecule drug discovery.",

        "Title": "A membrane-associated phosphoswitch in Rad controls adrenergic regulation of cardiac calcium channels.",
        "Abstract": "The ability to fight or flee from a threat relies on an acute adrenergic surge that augments cardiac output, which is dependent on increased cardiac contractility and heart rate. This cardiac response depends on \u03b2-adrenergic-initiated reversal of the small RGK G protein Rad-mediated inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV) acting through the Cav\u03b2 subunit. Here, we investigate how Rad couples phosphorylation to augmented Ca2+ influx and increased cardiac contraction. We show that reversal required phosphorylation of Ser272 and Ser300 within Rad's polybasic, hydrophobic C-terminal domain (CTD). Phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38 in Rad's N-terminal domain (NTD) alone was ineffective. Phosphorylation of Ser272 and Ser300 or the addition of 4 Asp residues to the CTD reduced Rad's association with the negatively charged, cytoplasmic plasmalemmal surface and with CaV\u03b2, even in the absence of CaV\u03b1, measured here by FRET. Addition of a posttranslationally prenylated CAAX motif to Rad's C-terminus, which constitutively tethers Rad to the membrane, prevented the physiological and biochemical effects of both phosphorylation and Asp substitution. Thus, dissociation of Rad from the sarcolemma, and consequently from CaV\u03b2, is sufficient for sympathetic upregulation of Ca2+ currents.",

        "Abstract": "Voltage-dependent and Ca2+-dependent inactivation (VDI and CDI, respectively) of CaV channels are two biologically consequential feedback mechanisms that fine-tune Ca2+ entry into neurons and cardiomyocytes. Although known to be initiated by distinct molecular events, how these processes obstruct conduction through the channel pore remains poorly defined. Here, focusing on ultrahighly conserved tryptophan residues in the interdomain interfaces near the selectivity filter of CaV1.3, we demonstrate a critical role for asymmetric conformational changes in mediating VDI and CDI. Specifically, mutagenesis of the domain III-IV interface, but not others, enhanced VDI. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that mutations in distinct selectivity filter interfaces differentially impact conformational flexibility. Furthermore, mutations in distinct domains preferentially disrupt CDI mediated by the N- versus C-lobes of CaM, thus uncovering a scheme of structural bifurcation of CaM signaling. These findings highlight the fundamental importance of the asymmetric arrangement of the pseudotetrameric CaV pore domain for feedback inhibition.",

Classical studies have shown that ion selectivity is determined by specific binding of ions to the channel pore, enabled by signature amino acid sequences within the selectivity filter (SF). By studying ancestral channels in the pond snail (Lymnaea stagnalis), Guan et\u00a0al. showed in a recent JBC article that this well-established mechanism can be tuned by alternative splicing, allowing a single Ca",

        "Abstract": "Fight-or-flight responses involve \u03b2-adrenergic-induced increases in heart rate and contractile force. In the present study, we uncover the primary mechanism underlying the heart's innate contractile reserve. We show that four protein kinase A (PKA)-phosphorylated residues in Rad, a calcium channel inhibitor, are crucial for controlling basal calcium current and essential for \u03b2-adrenergic augmentation of calcium influx in cardiomyocytes. Even with intact PKA signaling to other proteins modulating calcium handling, preventing adrenergic activation of calcium channels in Rad-phosphosite-mutant mice (4SA-Rad) has profound physiological effects: reduced heart rate with increased pauses, reduced basal contractility, near-complete attenuation of \u03b2-adrenergic contractile response and diminished exercise capacity. Conversely, expression of mutant calcium-channel \u03b2-subunits that cannot bind 4SA-Rad is sufficient to enhance basal calcium influx and contractility to adrenergically augmented levels of wild-type mice, rescuing the failing heart phenotype of 4SA-Rad mice. Hence, disruption of interactions between Rad and calcium channels constitutes the foundation toward next-generation therapeutics specifically enhancing cardiac contractility.",

        "Title": "CaV1.2 channelopathic mutations evoke diverse pathophysiological mechanisms.",
        "Abstract": "The first pathogenic mutation in CaV1.2 was identified in 2004 and was shown to cause a severe multisystem disorder known as Timothy syndrome (TS). The mutation was localized to the distal S6 region of the channel, a region known to play a major role in channel activation. TS patients suffer from life-threatening cardiac symptoms as well as significant neurodevelopmental deficits, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since this discovery, the number and variety of mutations identified in CaV1.2 have grown tremendously, and the distal S6 regions remain a frequent locus for many of these mutations. While the majority of patients harboring these mutations exhibit cardiac symptoms that can be well explained by known pathogenic mechanisms, the same cannot be said for the ASD or neurodevelopmental phenotypes seen in some patients, indicating a gap in our understanding of the pathogenesis of CaV1.2 channelopathies. Here, we use whole-cell patch clamp, quantitative Ca2+ imaging, and single channel recordings to expand the known mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CaV1.2 channelopathies. Specifically, we find that mutations within the S6 region can exert independent and separable effects on activation, voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI), and Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI). Moreover, the mechanisms underlying the CDI effects of these mutations are varied and include altered channel opening and possible disruption of CDI transduction. Overall, these results provide a structure-function framework to conceptualize the role of S6 mutations in pathophysiology and offer insight into the biophysical defects associated with distinct clinical manifestations.",

        "Abstract": "Ion channels are macromolecular complexes whose functions are exquisitely tuned by interacting proteins. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a powerful methodology that is adept at quantifying ion channel protein-protein interactions in living cells. For FRET experiments, the interacting partners are tagged with appropriate donor and acceptor fluorescent proteins. If the fluorescently-labeled molecules are in close proximity, then photoexcitation of the donor results in non-radiative energy transfer to the acceptor, and subsequent fluorescence emission of the acceptor. The stoichiometry of ion channel interactions and their relative binding affinities can be deduced by quantifying both the FRET efficiency and the total number of donors and acceptors in a given cell. In this chapter, we discuss general considerations for FRET analysis of biological interactions, various strategies for estimating FRET efficiencies, and detailed protocols for construction of binding curves and determination of stoichiometry. We focus on implementation of FRET assays using a flow cytometer given its amenability for high-throughput data acquisition, enhanced accessibility, and robust analysis. This versatile methodology permits mechanistic dissection of dynamic changes in ion channel interactions.",

        "Abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) are membrane proteins responsible for the rapid upstroke of the action potential in excitable cells. There are nine human voltage-sensitive NaV1 isoforms that, in addition to their sequence differences, differ in tissue distribution and specific function. This review focuses on isoforms NaV1.4 and NaV1.5, which are primarily expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, respectively. The determination of the structures of several eukaryotic NaVs by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has brought new perspective to the study of the channels. Alignment of the cryo-EM structure of the transmembrane channel pore with x-ray crystallographic structures of the cytoplasmic domains illustrates the complementary nature of the techniques and highlights the intricate cellular mechanisms that modulate these channels. Here, we review structural insights into the cytoplasmic C-terminal regulation of NaV1.4 and NaV1.5 with special attention to Ca2+ sensing by calmodulin, implications for disease, and putative channel dimerization.",

        "Abstract": "The Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin has emerged as a pivotal player in tuning Na+ channel function, although its impact in vivo remains to be resolved. Here, we identify the role of calmodulin and the NaV1.5 interactome in regulating late Na+ current in cardiomyocytes. We created transgenic mice with cardiac-specific expression of human NaV1.5 channels with alanine substitutions for the IQ motif (IQ/AA). The mutations rendered the channels incapable of binding calmodulin to the C-terminus. The IQ/AA transgenic mice exhibited normal ventricular repolarization without arrhythmias and an absence of increased late Na+ current. In comparison, transgenic mice expressing a lidocaine-resistant (F1759A) human NaV1.5 demonstrated increased late Na+ current and prolonged repolarization in cardiomyocytes, with spontaneous arrhythmias. To determine regulatory factors that prevent late Na+ current for the IQ/AA mutant channel, we considered fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs), which are within the NaV1.5 proteomic subdomain shown by proximity labeling in transgenic mice expressing NaV1.5 conjugated to ascorbate peroxidase. We found that FGF13 diminished late current of the IQ/AA but not F1759A mutant cardiomyocytes, suggesting that endogenous FHFs may serve to prevent late Na+ current in mouse cardiomyocytes. Leveraging endogenous mechanisms may furnish an alternative avenue for developing novel pharmacology that selectively blunts late Na+ current.",

        "Title": "TPC2 polymorphisms associated with a hair pigmentation phenotype in humans result in gain of channel function by independent mechanisms.",
        "Abstract": "Two-pore channels (TPCs) are endolysosomal cation channels. Two members exist in humans, TPC1 and TPC2. Functional roles associated with the ubiquitously expressed TPCs include VEGF-induced neoangiogenesis, LDL-cholesterol trafficking and degradation, physical endurance under fasting conditions, autophagy regulation, the acrosome reaction in sperm, cancer cell migration, and intracellular trafficking of pathogens such as Ebola virus or bacterial toxins (e.g., cholera toxin). In a genome-wide association study for variants associated with human pigmentation characteristics two coding variants of TPC2, rs35264875 (encoding M484L) and rs3829241 (encoding G734E), have been found to be associated with a shift from brown to blond hair color. In two recent follow-up studies a role for TPC2 in pigmentation has been further confirmed. However, these human polymorphic variants have not been functionally characterized until now. The development of endolysosomal patch-clamp techniques has made it possible to investigate directly ion channel activities and characteristics in isolated endolysosomal organelles. We applied this technique here to scrutinize channel characteristics of the polymorphic TPC2 variants in direct comparison with WT. We found that both polymorphisms lead to a gain of channel function by independent mechanisms. We next conducted a clinical study with more than 100 blond- and brown/black-haired individuals. We performed a genotype/phenotype analysis and subsequently isolated fibroblasts from WT and polymorphic variant carriers for endolysosomal patch-clamp experimentation to confirm key in vitro findings.",

This protocol describes a nondestructive live-cell FRET assay for robust quantification of relative binding affinities for protein-protein interactions. Unlike other approaches, our method correlates the measured FRET efficiencies to relative concentration of interacting proteins to determine binding isotherms while including collisional FRET corrections. We detail how to assemble and calibrate the equipment using experimental and theoretical procedures. A step-by-step protocol is given for sample preparation, data acquisition and analysis. The method uses relatively inexpensive and widely available equipment and can be performed with minimal training. Implementation of the imaging setup requires up to 1 week, and sample preparation takes \u223c1-3 d. An individual FRET experiment, including control measurements, can be completed within 4-6 h, with data analysis requiring an additional 1-3 h.",

While most of these light-responsive proteins were originally discovered in photosynthetic organisms, the past few decades have been punctuated by experiments that not only commandeer but also engineer and enhance these natural tools to explore a wide variety of physiological questions. In addition, the ability to tune dynamic range and kinetic rates of optogenetic actuators is a challenging question that is heavily explored with computational methods devised to facilitate optimization of these systems. Here, we explain the basic mechanisms of a few popular photodimerizing optogenetic systems, discuss applications, compare optogenetic tools against more traditional chemical methods, and propose a simple quantitative understanding of how actuators exert their influence on targeted processes.",

        "Abstract": "CaV1.3 channels are a major class of L-type Ca(2+) channels which contribute to the rhythmicity of the heart and brain. In the brain, these channels are vital for excitation-transcription coupling, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal firing. Moreover, disruption of CaV1.3 function has been associated with several neurological disorders. Here, we focus on the de novo missense mutation A760G which has been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To explore the role of this mutation in ASD pathogenesis, we examined the effects of A760G on CaV1.3 channel gating and regulation. Introduction of the mutation severely diminished the Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation (CDI) of CaV1.3 channels, an important feedback system required for Ca(2+) homeostasis. This reduction in CDI was observed in two major channel splice variants, though to different extents. Using an allosteric model of channel gating, we found that the underlying mechanism of CDI reduction is likely due to enhanced channel opening within the Ca(2+)-inactivated mode. Remarkably, the A760G mutation also caused an opposite increase in voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI), resulting in a multifaceted mechanism underlying ASD. When combined, these regulatory deficits appear to increase the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, thus potentially disrupting neuronal development and synapse formation, ultimately leading to ASD.",

        "Abstract": "David T. Yue was a renowned biophysicist who dedicated his life to the study of Ca(2+) signaling in cells. In the wake of his passing, we are left not only with a feeling of great loss, but with a tremendous and impactful body of work contributed by a remarkable man. David's research spanned the spectrum from atomic structure to organ systems, with a quantitative rigor aimed at understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying biological function. Along the way he developed new tools and approaches, enabling not only his own research but that of his contemporaries and those who will come after him. While we cannot hope to replicate the eloquence and style we are accustomed to in David's writing, we nonetheless undertake a review of David's chosen field of study with a focus on many of his contributions to the calcium channel field.",

        "Abstract": "Voltage-gated Na and Ca(2+) channels represent two major ion channel families that enable myriad biological functions including the generation of action potentials and the coupling of electrical and chemical signaling in cells. Calmodulin regulation (calmodulation) of these ion channels comprises a vital feedback mechanism with distinct physiological implications. Though long-sought, a shared understanding of the channel families remained elusive for two decades as the functional manifestations and the structural underpinnings of this modulation often appeared to diverge. Here, we review recent advancements in the understanding of calmodulation of Ca(2+) and Na channels that suggest a remarkable similarity in their regulatory scheme. This interrelation between the two channel families now paves the way towards a unified mechanistic framework to understand vital calmodulin-dependent feedback and offers shared principles to approach related channelopathic diseases. An exciting era of synergistic study now looms.",

        "Abstract": "The Ca(2+)-free form of calmodulin (apoCaM) often appears inert, modulating target molecules only upon conversion to its Ca(2+)-bound form. This schema has appeared to govern voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, where apoCaM has been considered a dormant Ca(2+) sensor, associated with channels but awaiting the binding of Ca(2+) ions before inhibiting channel opening to provide vital feedback inhibition. Using single-molecule measurements of channels and chemical dimerization to elevate apoCaM, we find that apoCaM binding on its own markedly upregulates opening, rivaling the strongest forms of modulation. Upon Ca(2+) binding to this CaM, inhibition may simply reverse the initial upregulation. As RNA-edited and -spliced channel variants show different affinities for apoCaM, the apoCaM-dependent control mechanisms may underlie the functional diversity of these variants and explain an elongation of\u00a0neuronal action potentials by apoCaM. More broadly, voltage-gated Na channels adopt this same modulatory principle. ApoCaM thus imparts potent and pervasive ion-channel regulation. PAPERCLIP:",

        "Title": "Calcineurin determines toxic versus beneficial responses to \u03b1-synuclein.",
        "Abstract": "Calcineurin (CN) is a highly conserved Ca(2+)-calmodulin (CaM)-dependent phosphatase that senses Ca(2+) concentrations and transduces that information into cellular responses. Ca(2+) homeostasis is disrupted by \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), a small lipid binding protein whose misfolding and accumulation is a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. We report that \u03b1-syn, from yeast to neurons, leads to sustained highly elevated levels of cytoplasmic Ca(2+), thereby activating a CaM-CN cascade that engages substrates that result in toxicity. Surprisingly, complete inhibition of CN also results in toxicity. Limiting the availability of CaM shifts CN's spectrum of substrates toward protective pathways. Modulating CN or CN's substrates with highly selective genetic and pharmacological tools (FK506) does the same. FK506 crosses the blood brain barrier, is well tolerated in humans, and is active in neurons and glia. Thus, a tunable response to CN, which has been conserved for a billion years, can be targeted to rebalance the phosphatase's activities from toxic toward beneficial substrates. These findings have immediate therapeutic implications for synucleinopathies.",

        "Abstract": "Voltage-gated Na and Ca2+ channels comprise distinct ion channel superfamilies, yet the carboxy tails of these channels exhibit high homology, hinting at a long-shared and purposeful module. For different Ca2+ channels, carboxyl-tail interactions with calmodulin do elaborate robust and similar forms of Ca2+ regulation. However, Na channels have only shown subtler Ca2+ modulation that differs among reports, challenging attempts at unified understanding. Here, by rapid Ca2+ photorelease onto Na channels, we reset this view of Na channel regulation. For cardiac-muscle channels (NaV1.5), reported effects from which most mechanistic proposals derive, we observe no Ca2+ modulation. Conversely, for skeletal-muscle channels (NaV1.4), we uncover fast Ca2+ regulation eerily similar to that of Ca2+ channels. Channelopathic myotonia mutations halve NaV1.4 Ca2+ regulation, and transplanting the NaV1.4 carboxy tail onto Ca2+ channels recapitulates Ca2+ regulation. Thus, we argue for the persistence and physiological relevance of an ancient Ca2+ regulatory module across Na and Ca2+ channels.",

        "Abstract": "Distinguishing between allostery and competition among modulating ligands is challenging for large target molecules. Out of practical necessity, inferences are often drawn from in vitro assays on target fragments, but such inferences may belie actual mechanisms. One key example of such ambiguity concerns calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs) that tune signaling molecules regulated by calmodulin (CaM). As CaBPs resemble CaM, CaBPs are believed to competitively replace CaM on targets. Yet, brain CaM expression far surpasses that of CaBPs, raising questions as to whether CaBPs can exert appreciable biological actions. Here, we devise a live-cell, holomolecule approach that reveals an allosteric mechanism for calcium channels whose CaM-mediated inactivation is eliminated by CaBP4. Our strategy is to covalently link CaM and/or CaBP to holochannels, enabling live-cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays to resolve a cyclical allosteric binding scheme for CaM and CaBP4 to channels, thus explaining how trace CaBPs prevail. This approach may apply generally for discerning allostery in live cells.",

        "Abstract": "CaV1.3 ion channels are dominant Ca(2+) portals into pacemaking neurons, residing at the epicenter of brain rhythmicity and neurodegeneration. Negative Ca(2+) feedback regulation of CaV1.3 channels (CDI) is therefore critical for Ca(2+) homeostasis. Intriguingly, nearly half the CaV1.3 transcripts in the brain\u00a0are RNA edited to reduce CDI and influence oscillatory activity. It is then mechanistically remarkable that this editing occurs precisely within an IQ\u00a0domain, whose interaction with Ca(2+)-bound calmodulin (Ca(2+)/CaM) is believed to induce CDI. Here, we sought the mechanism underlying the altered CDI of edited channels. Unexpectedly, editing failed to attenuate Ca(2+)/CaM binding. Instead, editing weakened the prebinding of Ca(2+)-free CaM (apoCaM) to channels, which proves essential for CDI. Thus, editing might render CDI continuously tunable by fluctuations in ambient CaM, a prominent effect we substantiate in substantia nigral neurons. This adjustability of Ca(2+) regulation by CaM now looms as a key element of CNS Ca(2+) homeostasis.",

The long-held structural correlation of this regulation has been Ca(2+)-bound calmodulin, complexed alone with an IQ domain on the channel carboxy terminus. Here, however, systematic alanine mutagenesis of the entire carboxyl tail of an L-type CaV1.3 channel casts doubt on this paradigm. To identify the actual molecular states underlying channel regulation, we develop a structure-function approach relating the strength of regulation to the affinity of underlying calmodulin/channel interactions, by a Langmuir relation (individually transformed Langmuir analysis). Accordingly, we uncover frank exchange of Ca(2+)-calmodulin to interfaces beyond the IQ domain, initiating substantial rearrangements of the calmodulin/channel complex. The N-lobe of Ca(2+)-calmodulin binds an N-terminal spatial Ca(2+) transforming element module on the channel amino terminus, whereas the C-lobe binds an EF-hand region upstream of the IQ domain. This system of structural plasticity furnishes a next-generation blueprint for CaV channel modulation.",

        "Abstract": "Ca(2+)/calmodulin- and voltage-dependent inactivation (CDI and VDI) comprise vital prototypes of Ca(2+) channel modulation, rich with biological consequences. Although the events initiating CDI and VDI are known, their downstream mechanisms have eluded consensus. Competing proposals include hinged-lid occlusion of channels, selectivity filter collapse, and allosteric inhibition of the activation gate. Here, novel theory predicts that perturbations of channel activation should alter inactivation in distinctive ways, depending on which hypothesis holds true. Thus, we systematically mutate the activation gate, formed by all S6 segments within Ca(V)1.3. These channels feature robust baseline CDI, and the resulting mutant library exhibits significant diversity of activation, CDI, and VDI. For CDI, a clear and previously unreported pattern emerges: activation-enhancing mutations proportionately weaken inactivation. This outcome substantiates an allosteric CDI mechanism. For VDI, the data implicate a \"hinged lid-shield\" mechanism, similar to a hinged-lid process, with a previously unrecognized feature. Namely, we detect a \"shield\" in Ca(V)1.3 channels that is specialized to repel lid closure. These findings reveal long-sought downstream mechanisms of inactivation and may furnish a framework for the understanding of Ca(2+) channelopathies involving S6 mutations.",

        "Title": "Analysis of quantal size of voltage responses to retinal stimulation in the accessory optic system.",
        "Abstract": "In the intact vertebrate central nervous system, the quantal nature of synaptic transmission is difficult to measure because the postsynaptic sites may be distributed along a tortuous dendritic tree that cannot be readily clamped spatially to a uniform potential. Titrating the intact brain's extracellular concentration of calcium ions is also challenging because of its strong buffering mechanisms. In this study, using a whole brain with eye attached preparation, quantal neurotransmission was examined in the turtle brainstem in vitro, by recording from accessory optic system neurons that receive direct input from visually responsive retinal ganglion cells. Unitary EPSPs, evoked by microstimulation of a single ganglion cell, were measured during whole cell current-clamp recordings. In this preparation, the neurons exhibit direction-selectivity, despite the hypoxic conditions. Bath application of cadmium to reduce calcium influx also reduced evoked EPSP amplitudes to that of the spontaneous synaptic events. Statistical analyses indicated that these evoked response amplitudes could be well fitted to a Poisson distribution for most brainstem neurons. Therefore, the spontaneous miniature excitatory synaptic events of approximately 1 mV, as also observed during spike blockade of the retina [Kogo, N., Ariel, M., 1997. Membrane properties and monosynaptic retinal excitation of neurons in the turtle accessory optic system. Journal of Neurophysiology 78, 614-627], are likely responses to the neurotransmitter of single vesicles release by retinal axon terminals.",
