        "Abstract": "Organoid cultures have been developed to model intestinal stem cell (ISC) function in self-renewal and differentiation. Upon differentiation, the first fate decision for ISC and early progenitors to make is between secretory (Paneth cell, goblet cell, enteroendocrine cell, or tuft cell) and absorptive (enterocyte and M cell) lineages. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, in vivo studies in the past decade have revealed that Notch signaling functions as a binary switch for the secretory vs. absorptive lineage decision in adult intestine. Recent breakthroughs in organoid-based assays enable real-time observation of smaller-scale and higher-throughput experiments in vitro, which have begun contributing to new understandings of mechanistic principles underlying intestinal differentiation. In this chapter, we summarize the in vivo and in vitro tools for modulating Notch signaling and assess its impact on intestinal cell fate. We also provide example protocols of how to use intestinal organoids as functional assays to study Notch activity in intestinal lineage decisions.",

        "Abstract": "The equilibrium between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation followed by proper lineage specification of progenitor cells is considered imperative for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. In the hierarchical model, intestinal differentiation is defined by the stepwise acquisition of lineage-specific mature cell features, where Notch signaling and lateral inhibition instructively regulate the cell-fate decisions. Recent studies reveal a broadly permissive intestinal chromatin underlies the lineage plasticity and adaptation to diet mediated by Notch transcriptional program. Here, we review the conventional understanding of Notch programming in intestinal differentiation and describe how new data from epigenetic and transcriptional analyses may refine or revise the current view. We provide instructions on sample preparation and data analysis and explain how to use ChIP-seq and scRNA-seq in combination of lineage tracing assay to determine the dynamics of Notch program and intestinal differentiation in the context of dietary and metabolic regulation of cell-fate decisions.",

        "Abstract": "Stem cells are remarkably small. Whether small size is important for stem cell function is unknown. We find that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) enlarge under conditions known to decrease stem cell function. This decreased fitness of large HSCs is due to reduced proliferation and was accompanied by altered metabolism. Preventing HSC enlargement or reducing large HSCs in size averts the loss of stem cell potential under conditions causing stem cell exhaustion. Last, we show that murine and human HSCs enlarge during aging. Preventing this age-dependent enlargement improves HSC function. We conclude that small cell size is important for stem cell function in vivo and propose that stem cell enlargement contributes to their functional decline during aging.",

        "Abstract": "Studies in various tissues have revealed a central role of metabolic pathways in regulating adult stem cell function in tissue regeneration and tumor initiation. The unique metabolic dependences or preferences of adult stem cells, therefore, are emerging as a new category of therapeutic target. Recently, advanced methods including high-resolution metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics have been developed to address the growing interest in stem cell metabolism. A practical framework integrating the omics analyses is needed to systematically perform metabolic characterization in a cell-type-specific manner. Here, we leverage recent advances in transcriptomics and proteomics research to identify cell-type-specific metabolic features by reconstructing cell identity using genes and the encoded enzymes involved in major metabolic pathways. We provide protocols for cell isolation, transcriptome and proteome analyses, and metabolite profiling and measurement. The workflow for mapping cell-type-specific metabolic signatures presented here, although initially developed for intestinal crypt cells, can be easily implemented for cell populations in other tissues, and is highly compatible with most public datasets. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Emerging evidence indicates that adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs) actively adjust their fate decisions in response to diets and nutritional states to drive intestinal adaptation. Here, we review the signaling mechanisms mediating the dietary responses imposed by caloric intake and nutritional composition (i.e., macronutrients and micronutrients), fasting-feeding patterns, diet-induced growth factors, and microbiota on ISCs and their relevance to the beginnings of intestinal tumors.",

        "Abstract": "The small intestine is responsible for nutrient absorption and one of the most important interfaces between the environment and the body. During aging, changes of the epithelium lead to food malabsorption and reduced barrier function, thus increasing disease risk. The drivers of these alterations remain poorly understood. Here, we compare the proteomes of intestinal crypts from mice across different anatomical regions and ages. We find that aging alters epithelial immunity, metabolism, and cell proliferation and is accompanied by region-dependent skewing in the cellular composition of the epithelium. Of note, short-term dietary restriction followed by refeeding partially restores the epithelium by promoting stem cell differentiation toward the secretory lineage. We identify Hmgcs2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A [CoA] synthetase 2), the rate-limiting enzyme for ketogenesis, as a modulator of stem cell differentiation that responds to dietary changes, and we provide an atlas of region- and age-dependent proteome changes of the small intestine.",

        "Abstract": "Diet has a profound effect on tissue regeneration in diverse organisms, and low caloric states such as intermittent fasting have beneficial effects on organismal health and age-associated loss of tissue function. The role of adult stem and progenitor cells in responding to short-term fasting and whether such responses improve regeneration are not well studied. Here we show that a 24\u00a0hr fast augments intestinal stem cell (ISC) function in young and aged mice by inducing a fatty acid oxidation (FAO) program and that pharmacological activation of this program mimics many effects of fasting. Acute genetic disruption of Cpt1a, the rate-limiting enzyme in FAO, abrogates ISC-enhancing effects of fasting, but long-term Cpt1a deletion decreases ISC numbers and function,\u00a0implicating a role for FAO in ISC maintenance. These\u00a0findings highlight a role for FAO in mediating pro-regenerative effects of fasting in intestinal biology, and they may represent a viable strategy for enhancing intestinal regeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Stem-cell-based therapies can potentially reverse organ dysfunction and diseases, but the removal of impaired tissue and activation of a program leading to organ regeneration pose major challenges. In mice, a 4-day fasting mimicking diet (FMD) induces a stepwise expression of Sox17 and Pdx-1, followed by Ngn3-driven generation of insulin-producing \u03b2\u00a0cells, resembling that observed during pancreatic development. FMD cycles restore insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis in both type 2 and type 1 diabetes mouse models. In human type 1 diabetes pancreatic islets, fasting conditions reduce PKA and mTOR activity and induce Sox2 and Ngn3 expression and insulin production. The effects of the FMD are reversed by IGF-1 treatment and recapitulated by PKA and mTOR inhibition. These results indicate that a FMD promotes the reprogramming of\u00a0pancreatic cells to restore insulin generation in islets from T1D patients and reverse both T1D and T2D phenotypes in mouse models.

        "Abstract": "Calorie restriction or changes in dietary composition can enhance healthy aging, but the inability of most subjects to adhere to chronic and extreme diets, as well as potentially adverse effects, limits their application. We randomized 100 generally healthy participants from the United States into two study arms and tested the effects of a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD)-low in calories, sugars, and protein but high in unsaturated fats-on markers/risk factors associated with aging and age-related diseases. We compared subjects who followed 3 months of an unrestricted diet to subjects who consumed the FMD for 5 consecutive days per month for 3 months. Three FMD cycles reduced body weight, trunk, and total body fat; lowered blood pressure; and decreased insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). No serious adverse effects were reported. After 3 months, control diet subjects were crossed over to the FMD program, resulting in a total of 71 subjects completing three FMD cycles. A post hoc analysis of subjects from both FMD arms showed that body mass index, blood pressure, fasting glucose, IGF-1, triglycerides, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and C-reactive protein were more beneficially affected in participants at risk for disease than in subjects who were not at risk. Thus, cycles of a 5-day FMD are safe, feasible, and effective in reducing markers/risk factors for aging and age-related diseases. Larger studies in patients with diagnosed diseases or selected on the basis of risk factors are warranted to confirm the effect of the FMD on disease prevention and treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Immune-based interventions are promising strategies to achieve long-term cancer-free survival. Fasting was previously shown to differentially sensitize tumors to chemotherapy while protecting normal cells, including hematopoietic stem and immune cells, from its toxic side effects. Here, we show that the combination of chemotherapy and a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) increases the levels of bone marrow common lymphoid progenitor cells and cytotoxic CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), leading to a major delay in breast cancer and melanoma progression. In breast tumors, this effect is partially mediated by the downregulation of the stress-responsive enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). These data indicate that FMD cycles combined with chemotherapy can enhance T\u00a0cell-dependent targeted killing of cancer cells both by stimulating the hematopoietic system and by enhancing CD8(+)-dependent tumor cytotoxicity.",

        "Abstract": "Prolonged fasting (PF) promotes stress resistance, but its effects on longevity are poorly understood. We show that alternating PF and nutrient-rich medium extended yeast lifespan independently of established pro-longevity genes. In mice, 4 days of a diet that mimics fasting (FMD), developed to minimize the burden of PF, decreased the size of multiple organs/systems, an effect followed upon re-feeding by an elevated number of progenitor and stem cells and regeneration. Bi-monthly FMD cycles started at middle age extended longevity, lowered visceral fat, reduced cancer incidence and skin lesions, rejuvenated the immune system, and retarded bone mineral density loss. In old mice, FMD cycles promoted hippocampal neurogenesis, lowered IGF-1 levels and PKA activity, elevated NeuroD1, and improved cognitive performance. In a pilot clinical trial, three FMD cycles decreased risk factors/biomarkers for aging, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer without major adverse effects, providing support for the use of FMDs to promote healthspan.",

        "Abstract": "trans,trans-2,4-Decadienal (tt-DDE), a lipid peroxidation product of linolieic acid, is the most abundant aldehyde identified in cooking oil fumes and is readily detectable in food products as well as in restaurant emissions. Previously, we have reported the toxicological effects of tt-DDE in vitro and in vivo. However, the metabolic pathways of tt-DDE in vivo remain unclear. In our present study, we combined liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with triple quadrupole and time-of-flight to identify tt-DDE metabolites in the urine of mice orally administered tt-DDE. We identified two tt-DDE metabolites, 2,4-decadienoic acid and cysteine-conjugated 2,4-decadien-1-ol, in the urine of mice gavaged with tt-DDE and in human hepatoma cell cultures. The structure of 2,4-decadienoic acid was confirmed upon comparison of its tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectrum and retention time with those of synthetic standards. The moieties of cysteine and alcohol on cysteine-conjugated 2,4-decadien-1-ol were validated by treating cell cultures with stable-isotope-labeled cysteine and 4-methylpyrazole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor. The MS/MS spectra of a cysteine standard and ionized cysteine detached from cysteine-conjugated 2,4-decadien-1-ol were identical. Two metabolic pathways for the biotransformation of tt-DDE in vivo are proposed: (i) the oxidation of tt-DDE to the corresponding carboxylic acid, 2,4-decadienoic acid, in liver cells and (ii) glutathione (GHS) conjugation, GSH breakdown, and aldehyde reduction, which generate cysteine-conjugated 2,4-decadien-1-ol in both liver and lung cells. In conclusion, this platform can be used to identify tt-DDE metabolites, and cysteine-conjugated 2,4-decadien-1-ol can serve as a biomarker for assessing exposure to tt-DDE.",

        "Abstract": "Immune system defects are at the center of aging and a range of diseases. Here, we show that prolonged fasting reduces circulating IGF-1 levels and PKA activity in various cell populations, leading to signal transduction changes in long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and niche cells that promote stress resistance, self-renewal, and lineage-balanced regeneration. Multiple cycles of fasting abated the immunosuppression and mortality caused by chemotherapy and reversed age-dependent myeloid-bias in mice, in agreement with preliminary data on the protection of lymphocytes from chemotoxicity in fasting patients. The proregenerative effects of fasting on stem cells were recapitulated by deficiencies in either IGF-1 or PKA and blunted by exogenous IGF-1. These findings link the reduced levels of IGF-1 caused by fasting to PKA signaling and establish their crucial role in regulating hematopoietic stem cell protection, self-renewal, and regeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Mice and humans with growth hormone receptor/IGF-1 deficiencies display major reductions in age-related diseases. Because protein restriction reduces GHR-IGF-1 activity, we examined links between protein intake and mortality. Respondents aged 50-65 reporting high protein intake had a 75% increase in overall mortality and a 4-fold increase in cancer death risk during the following 18 years. These associations were either abolished or attenuated if the proteins were plant derived. Conversely, high protein intake was associated with reduced cancer and overall mortality in respondents over 65, but a 5-fold increase in diabetes mortality across all ages. Mouse studies confirmed the effect of high protein intake and GHR-IGF-1 signaling on the incidence and progression of breast and melanoma tumors, but also the detrimental effects of a low protein diet in the very old. These results suggest that low protein intake during middle age followed by moderate to high protein consumption in old adults may optimize healthspan and longevity.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in growth signaling pathways extend life span, as well as protect against age-dependent DNA damage in yeast and decrease insulin resistance and cancer in mice. To test their effect in humans, we monitored for 22 years Ecuadorian individuals who carry mutations in the growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene that lead to severe GHR and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) deficiencies. We combined this information with surveys to identify the cause and age of death for individuals in this community who died before this period. The individuals with GHR deficiency exhibited only one nonlethal malignancy and no cases of diabetes, in contrast to a prevalence of 17% for cancer and 5% for diabetes in control subjects. A possible explanation for the very low incidence of cancer was suggested by in vitro studies: Serum from subjects with GHR deficiency reduced DNA breaks but increased apoptosis in human mammary epithelial cells treated with hydrogen peroxide. Serum from GHR-deficient subjects also caused reduced expression of RAS, PKA (protein kinase A), and TOR (target of rapamycin) and up-regulation of SOD2 (superoxide dismutase 2) in treated cells, changes that promote cellular protection and life-span extension in model organisms. We also observed reduced insulin concentrations (1.4 \u03bcU/ml versus 4.4 \u03bcU/ml in unaffected relatives) and a very low HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance) index (0.34 versus 0.96 in unaffected relatives) in individuals with GHR deficiency, indicating higher insulin sensitivity, which could explain the absence of diabetes in these subjects. These results provide evidence for a role of evolutionarily conserved pathways in the control of aging and disease burden in humans.",

A novel DNA selection and direct extraction process has been proposed, integrated and tested on chip. The integrative microfluidic chip can perform the whole procedure of DNA recombination, including DNA digestion, gel electrophoresis, DNA extraction and insert-vector ligation within 1\u2009h. In this high-throughput design, the manual gel cutting was replaced by an automatic processing system that performed high-quality and high-recovery efficiency in DNA extraction process. With no need of gel-dissolving reagents and manipulation, the application of selection and direct extraction process could significantly eliminate the risks from UV and EtBr and also facilitate DNA recombination. Reliable output with high success rate of cloning has been achieved with a significant reduction in operational hazards, required materials, efforts and time.",
