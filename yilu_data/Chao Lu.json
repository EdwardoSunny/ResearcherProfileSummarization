        "Abstract": "Chondrocyte ferroptosis induces the occurrence of osteoarthritis (OA). As a key gene of OA, C5a receptor 1 (C5AR1) is related to ferroptosis. Here, we investigated whether C5AR1 interferes with chondrocyte ferroptosis during OA occurrence. C5AR1 was downregulated in PA-treated chondrocytes. Overexpression of C5AR1 increased the cell viability and decreased ferroptosis in chondrocytes. Moreover, Tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 13B (TNFSF13B) was downregulated in PA-treated chondrocytes, and knockdown of TNFSF13B eliminated the inhibitory effect of C5AR1 on ferroptosis in chondrocytes. More importantly, the PI3K/Akt/GSK3\u03b2/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway inhibitor LY294002 reversed the inhibition of C5AR1 or TNFSF13B on ferroptosis in chondrocytes. Finally, we found that C5AR1 alleviated joint tissue lesions and ferroptosis in rats and inhibited the progression of OA in the rat OA model constructed by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT), which was reversed by interfering with TNFSF13B. This study shows that C5AR1 reduces the progression of OA by upregulating TNFSF13B to activate the PI3K/Akt/GSK3\u03b2/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and thereby inhibiting chondrocyte sensitivity to ferroptosis, indicating that C5AR1 may be a potential therapeutic target for ferroptosis-related diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Microneedles (MNs) have gained increasing attention in the biomedical field, owing to their notable advantages over injectable and transdermal preparations. The mechanical properties of MNs are the key to determine whether MNs can puncture the skin for efficient drug delivery and therapeutic purposes. However, there is still lacking of a systemic summary on how to improve the mechanical properties of MNs. Herein, this review mainly analyzes the key factors affecting the mechanical properties of MNs from the theoretical point of view and puts forward improvement approaches. First, we analyzed the major stresses exerted on the MNs during skin puncture and described general methods to evaluate the mechanical properties of MNs. We then provided detail examples to elucidate how the physicochemical properties of single polymer, formulation compositions, and geometric parameters affected the mechanical properties of MNs. Overall, the mechanical strength of MNs can be enhanced by tuning the crosslinking density, crystallinity degree, and molecular weight of single polymer, introducing polysaccharides and nano-microparticles as reinforcers to form complex with polymer, and optimizing the geometric parameters of MNs. Therefore, this review will provide critical guidance on how to fabricate MNs with robust mechanical strength for successful transdermal drug delivery.",

        "Abstract": "Muscle invasive bladder cancers (BCs) can be divided into 2 major subgroups-basal/squamous (BASQ) tumors and luminal tumors. Since Pparg has low or undetectable expression in BASQ tumors, we tested the effects of rosiglitazone, Pparg agonist, in a mouse model of BASQ BC. We find that rosiglitazone reduces proliferation while treatment with rosiglitazone plus trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, induces apoptosis and reduces tumor volume by 91% after 1 month. Rosiglitazone and trametinib also induce a shift from BASQ to luminal differentiation in tumors, which our analysis suggests is mediated by retinoid signaling, a pathway known to drive the luminal differentiation program. Our data suggest that rosiglitazone, trametinib, and retinoids, which are all FDA approved, may be clinically active in BASQ tumors in patients.",

        "Abstract": "The development of narrow-spectrum antimicrobial agents is paramount for swiftly eradicating pathogenic bacteria, mitigating the onset of drug resistance, and preserving the homeostasis of bacterial microbiota in tissues. Owing to the limited affinity between the hydrophobic lipid bilayer interior of bacterial cells and most hydrophilic, polar peptides, the construction of a distinctive class of four-armed host-defense peptides/peptidomimetics (HDPs) is proposed with enhanced specificity and membrane perturbation capability against Pseudomonas aeruginosa by incorporating imidazole groups. These groups demonstrate substantial affinity for unsaturated phospholipids, which are predominantly expressed in the cell membrane of P. aeruginosa, thereby enabling HDPs to exhibit narrow-spectrum activity against this bacterium. Computational simulations and experimental investigations have corroborated that the imidazole-rich, four-armed peptidomimetics exhibit notable selectivity toward bacteria over mammalian cells. Among them, 4H10, characterized by its abundant and densely distributed imidazole groups, exhibits impressive activity against various clinically isolated P. aeruginosa strains. Moreover, 4H10 has demonstrated potential as an antibiotic adjuvant, enhancing doxycycline accumulation and exerting effects on intracellular targets by efficiently disrupting bacterial cell membranes. Consequently, the hydrogel composed of 4H10 and doxycycline emerged as a promising topical agent, significantly diminishing the skin P. aeruginosa burden by 97.1% within 2 days while inducing minimal local and systemic toxicity.",

        "Abstract": "Liver fibrosis is a pathological process caused by a variety of chronic liver diseases. Currently, therapeutic options for liver fibrosis are very limited, highlighting the urgent need to explore new treatment approaches. Epigenetic modifications and epitranscriptomic modifications, as reversible regulatory mechanisms, are involved in the development of liver fibrosis. In recent years, researches in epitranscriptomics and epigenetics have opened new perspectives for understanding the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Exploring the epigenetic mechanisms of liver fibrosis may provide valuable insights into the development of new therapies for chronic liver diseases. This review primarily focus on the regulatory mechanisms of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, non-coding RNA, and DNA methylation in organ fibrosis. It discusses the interactions between m6A modification and DNA methylation, as well as between m6A modification and non-coding RNA, providing a reference for understanding the interplay between epitranscriptomics and epigenetics.",

        "Abstract": "Aberrant cell proliferation is a hallmark of cancer, including breast cancer. Here, we show that USP27X is required for cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in breast cancer. We identify a PIM2-USP27X regulator of MYC signaling axis whose activity is an important contributor to the tumor biology of breast cancer. PIM2 phosphorylates USP27X, and promotes its deubiquitylation activity for MYC, which promotes its protein stability and leads to increase HK2-mediated aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer. Moreover, the PIM2-USP27X-MYC axis is also validated in PIM2-knockout mice. Taken together, these findings show a PIM2-USP27X-MYC signaling axis as a new potential target for breast cancer treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major cellular component in the tumor microenvironment and have been shown to exhibit\u00a0protumorigenic effects in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to delve into the mechanisms underlying the tumor-promoting effects of CAFs in HCC. Small RNA sequencing was conducted to screen differential expressed microRNAs in exosomes derived from CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs). The miR-92a-3p expression was then measured using reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR in CAFs, NFs, CAFs-derived exosomes (CAFs-Exo), and NF-derived exosomes (NFs-Exo). Compared to NFs or NF-Exo, CAFs and CAFs-Exo significantly promoted HCC cell proliferation, migration, and stemness. Additionally, compared to NFs or NF-Exo, miR-92a-3p level was notably higher in CAFs and CAFs-Exo, respectively. Exosomal miR-92a-3p was found to enhance HCC cell proliferation, migration, and stemness. Meanwhile, AXIN1 was targeted by miR-92a-3p. Exosomal miR-92a-3p could activate \u03b2-catenin/CD44 signaling in HCC cells by inhibiting AXIN1 messenger RNA. Furthermore, in vivo studies verified that exosomal miR-92a-3p notably promoted tumor growth and stemness through targeting AXIN1/\u03b2-catenin axis. Collectively, CAFs secreted exosomal miR-92a-3p was capable of promoting growth and stemness in HCC through activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway by suppressing AXIN1. Therefore, targeting CAFs-derived miR-92a-3p may be a potential strategy for treating HCC.",

        "Abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a temporally and spatially precisely controllable, noninvasive, and potentially highly efficient method of phototherapy. The three components of PDT primarily include photosensitizers, oxygen, and light. PDT employs specific wavelengths of light to active photosensitizers at the tumor site, generating reactive oxygen species that are fatal to tumor cells. Nevertheless, traditional photosensitizers have disadvantages such as poor water solubility, severe oxygen-dependency, and low targetability, and the light is difficult to penetrate the deep tumor tissue, which remains the toughest task in the application of PDT in the clinic. Here, we systematically summarize the development and the molecular mechanisms of photosensitizers, and the challenges of PDT in tumor management, highlighting the advantages of nanocarriers-based PDT against cancer. The development of third generation photosensitizers has opened up new horizons in PDT, and the cooperation between nanocarriers and PDT has attained satisfactory achievements. Finally, the clinical studies of PDT are discussed. Overall, we present an overview and our perspective of PDT in the field of tumor management, and we believe this work will provide a new insight into tumor-based PDT.",

        "Abstract": "In this Letter, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a highly sensitive distributed dynamic pressure sensor based on a dual-linear frequency modulated optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) and a coating thickness-enhanced single-mode fiber (SMF). A dual-sideband linear frequency modulation (LFM) signal is used to interrogate the sensing fiber, which allows us to obtain a dual-sideband Rayleigh backscattering signal. Due to the opposite slopes of the two LFM sidebands, the Rayleigh backscattering spectra of the two sidebands drift in opposite directions when the fiber is disturbed. By subtracting the frequency shifts of the two spectra, we can double the system's sensitivity. We further enhance the sensitivity by using an SMF with a coating thickness of 200\u2005\u03bcm. This results in a pressure sensitivity of 3979\u2005MHz/MPa, a measurement accuracy of 0.76\u2005kPa, and a spatial resolution of 35\u2005cm over a 500\u2005m optical fiber. Our system successfully detected a dynamic pressure change at a sampling rate of 1.25\u2005kHz, demonstrating the sensor's excellent dynamic measuring capabilities.",

        "Abstract": "The application of supramolecular assembly (SA) with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in aqueous phase has the potential to revolutionize numerous fields. However, using simple molecules with crystalline RTP to construct SA with aqueous phase RTP is hardly possible from the standpoint of forces. The reason lies in that the transition from crystal to SA involves a structure transformation from highly stable to more dynamic state, leading to increased non-radiative deactivation pathways and silent RTP signal. Here, with the benefit of the confinement from the layered double hydroxide (LDH), various simple molecules (benzene derivatives) can successfully form metastable SA with aqueous phase RTP. The maximum of RTP lifetime and efficiency can reach 654.87\u2005ms and 5.02\u2009%, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal the LDH energy trap can strengthen the intermolecular interaction, providing the prerequisite for the existence of metastable SA and appearance of aqueous phase RTP. The universality of this strategy will usher exploration into other multifunctional monomer, facilitating the development of SAs with aqueous phase RTP.",

        "Abstract": "Interferon-induced transmembrane 3 (IFITM3) is a membrane-associated protein that exhibits antiviral activities against a wide range of viruses through interactions with other cellular and viral proteins. However, knowledge of the mechanisms of IFITM3 in Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) infection has been lacking. In this study, we demonstrate that IFN-\u03b1 treatment induces the upregulation of IFITM3 activity and thus attenuates PDCoV infection. PDCoV replication is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by IFITM3 overexpression. To clarify the novel roles of IFITM3 during PDCoV infection, proteins that interact with IFITM3 were screened by TAP/MS in an ST cell line stably expressing IFITM3 via a lentivirus. We identified known and novel candidate IFITM3-binding proteins and analyzed the protein complexes using GO annotation, KEGG pathway analysis, and protein interaction network analysis. A total of 362 cellular proteins associate with IFITM3 during the first 24\u202fh post-infection. Of these proteins, the relationship between IFITM3 and Rab9a was evaluated by immunofluorescence colocalization analysis using confocal microscopy. IFITM3 partially colocalized with Rab9a and Rab9a exhibited enhanced colocalization following PDCoV infection. We also demonstrated that IFITM3 interacts specifically with Rab9a. Our results considerably expand the protein networks of IFITM3, suggesting that IFITM3 participates in multiple cellular processes during PDCoV infection.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel ultrasonic longitudinal wave resonance method for measuring the thickness of metal walls using a laser-electromagnetic acoustic transducer (Laser-EMAT). The method is based on the surface constraint mechanism (SCM) of the material and is expected to be capable of accurately detecting local thinning of metal walls in a non-contact manner and at high temperatures. Based on finite element analysis of laser-EMAT ultrasonic resonance measurement of aluminum alloy thickness, we investigated the effects of such key factors as SCM, irradiation parameters of laser source, and the size of EMAT receiving coil on the accuracy of thickness measurement (resonance frequency position) and on the amplitude of the resonance wave. Both numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the measurement accuracy of the proposed method is not affected by SCM, irradiation laser source parameters, and EMAT receiving coil size, and that accurate detection of stepped aluminum plates with thickness thinning from 3.0\u00a0mm to 0.5\u00a0mm is achieved. Furthermore, we were able to perform rapid detection of aluminum thin plate thickness at 500\u00a0\u00b0C temperature with an EMAT lift-off of 5.0\u00a0mm and achieved a relative experimental error as small as 3.40\u00a0%. The results obtained in this study showed that the proposed method performed well in non-contact measurement of metal thinning in harsh environment of high temperature.",

        "Abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a sand fly-borne infection of significant public health concern in Pakistan (endemic for CL). This study aimed to scrutinize the environmental and socio-economic risk factors for CL in district Khyber (located on Pak-Afghan border), Pakistan. Clinically confirmed 2881 CL case records for (January-December) 2017 and 2020 were obtained from district hospital. In addition, a questionnaire for CL risk factors assessment was administered to 525 households (175 in 2017 and 350 in 2020) in 40 villages throughout the district in a household survey. Higher number of CL cases were recorded in 2020 (N\u00a0=\u00a01824 belonging to 90 villages) compared to 2017 (N\u00a0=\u00a01057 from 42 villages). Highest number of CL patient cases were recorded in tehsil Jamrud (N\u00a0=\u00a02248, 39.01\u00a0%), followed by Landi Kotal (N\u00a0=\u00a0398, 6.91\u00a0%) and Bara (N\u00a0=\u00a0235, 4.08\u00a0%). Records showed higher number of CL cases in males (N\u00a0=\u00a01,659, 57.58\u00a0%) compared to females (N\u00a0=\u00a01,222, 42.41\u00a0%). In 2017 and 2020 the disease burden peaked in January. GIS-based spatial analyses of hospital records revealed that CL cases were abundant at 294-1,916\u00a0m elevation, in agriculture and range lands. Univariate logistic regression model analysis of risk factors suggested that higher education, family size >15, knowledge of CL, having family member/s that suffered from CL in the past, knowledge about biting time of sand flies, use of mosquito spray, presence of Afghan refugees in the village/s and living in mud-made houses increased the risk of acquiring CL. The multivariable logistic regression model showed none of the risk factors to be statistically significant. Findings of the study are crucial towards effective and targeted control of CL in district Khyber.",

Nanozymes offer a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of skin wounds, owing to their advantages in regulating redox homeostasis to reduce oxidative damage and kill bacteria. These properties make them an effective treatment option for skin wounds. However, most of current nanozymes lack the capability to simultaneously address inflammation, oxidative stress, and bacterial infection during the wound healing process. There is still great potential for nanozymes to increase their therapeutic functional diversity and efficacy.",

        "Abstract": "The development of antibiotic-loaded microneedles has been hindered for years by limited excipient options, restricted drug-loading space, poor microneedle formability, and short-term drug retention. Therefore, this study proposes a dissolving microneedle fabricated from the host-defense peptide \u03b5-poly-l-lysine (EPL) as an antibacterial adjuvant system for delivering antibiotics. EPL serves not only as a major matrix material for the microneedle tips, but also as a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent that facilitates the intracellular accumulation of the antibiotic doxycycline (DOX) by increasing bacterial cell membrane permeability. Furthermore, the formation of physically crosslinked networks of EPL affords microneedle tips with improved formability, good mechanical properties, and amorphous nanoparticles (approximately 7.2\u00a0nm) of encapsulated DOX. As a result, a high total loading content of both antimicrobials up to 2319.1\u00a0\u03bcg/patch is achieved for efficient transdermal drug delivery. In a Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced deep cutaneous infection model, the EPL microneedles demonstrates potent and long-term effects by synergistically enhancing antibiotic activities and prolonging drug retention in infected lesions, resulting in remarkable therapeutic efficacy with 99.91\u00a0% (3.04 log) reduction in skin bacterial burden after a single administration. Overall, our study highlights the distinct advantages of EPL microneedles and their potential in clinical antibacterial practice when loaded with amorphous DOX nanoparticles.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent type of dementia, presenting a substantial danger to the health and well-being of the aged population. It has arisen as a significant public health problem with considerable socioeconomic repercussions. Unfortunately, no effective treatments or diagnostic tools are available for Alzheimer's disease. Despite substantial studies on the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's, the molecular pathways underpinning its development remain poorly understood. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) vary in size from 200 nucleotides to over 100 kilobytes and have been found to play critical roles in various vital biological processes that play critical in developing Alzheimer's disease. This review intends to examine the functions of long non-coding RNAs in diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease and their participation in immunological responses associated with AD.",

        "Title": "Electron Transfer Efficiency-Regulated Electrochemiluminescence for Rapid Crystallinity Analysis in Layered Materials.",
        "Abstract": "The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) signal is largely determined by the electron transfer efficiency. Therefore, in the nanomaterial-involved ECL system, the structure-related electron distribution could affect the electron transfer efficiency and further alter the ECL intensity. These features make the design of versatile ECL-based analytical techniques for probing the correlated structure possible. And it is generally accepted that the increased crystallinity of nanomaterials usually leads to a uniform electron distribution, which provides higher conductivity. Therefore, the crystallinity-improved conductivity could facilitate electron transfer, promote the electrochemical activity of support materials, and boost the efficiency of the ECL reaction. In this study, we have demonstrated that the ECL signal of the graphitic carbon nitride reporter was proportional to the crystallinity of layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which meets the supposition well. On the basis of this phenomenon, an ECL-based crystallinity analysis approach has been established using CdAl-LDHs as the model materials. The universality of this proposed technique was further validated by the rapid and accurate crystallinity determination of ZnAl-LDH samples with diverse crystallinities. This work not only contributes an alternative to the X-ray diffraction technique for the rapid screening of crystallinity in layered materials but also opens a new avenue for the design of ECL-based structure analysis techniques toward nanomaterials and even organic materials by involving electron transfer regulation correlation.",

By implementing adaptive memory length for each pattern in the AML-LUT-based DPD, the size of the AML-LUT can be significantly reduced without sacrificing performance compared to both the full-size LUT and the multi-symbol simplified look-up table (MSS-LUT)-based DPDs. The performance of the proposed AML-LUT-based DPD is experimentally evaluated for a 625 Mbit/s 4-PAM UOWC over 1 m transmission length. Experimental results show that compared with the full-size LUT with a memory length of 7 (LUT-7)-based DPD, the proposed AML-LUT-based DPD (i) incurs a marginal power penalty of 0.5\u2005dB at both the 7% hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) and KP4-FEC threshold limits, while simultaneously reducing the implementation complexity (i.e., the LUT size) by 93%; (ii) achieves comparable transmission performance compared to the MSS-LUT-based DPD, while reducing the implementation complexity by 89%; and (iii) shows great potential for high-speed, low-complexity and memory-efficient intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) UOWC and short-reach optical interconnects.",

However, their high-rate capability and mechanical properties are limited because of unsatisfactory ion transfer kinetics and interfacial modulus mismatch inside devices. Here, we develop a metal-organic framework interface with superior electrical and mechanical properties for supercapacitors. The interfacial mechanism facilitates ultrafast ion transfer with an energy barrier reduction of 43% compared with that of conventional transmembrane transport. It delivers high specific capacity at a wide rate range and exhibits ultrastability beyond 30000 charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, meliorative modulus mismatch benefited from ultrathin interface design that improves mechanical properties of flexible supercapacitors. It delivers a stable energy supply under various mechanical conditions like bending and twisting status and displays ultrastable mechanical properties with performance retention of 95.5% after 10\u202f000 bending cycles. The research paves the way for interfacial engineering for ultrastable electrochemical devices.",

        "Abstract": "It is essential to probe the coordination number (CN) because it is a crucial factor to ensure the catalytic capability of single-atom catalysts (SACs). Currently, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is widely used to measure the CN. However, the scarcity of synchrotron X-ray source and complicated data analysis restrict its wide applications in determining the CN of SACs. In this contribution, we have developed a d-band center-regulated acetone cataluminescence (CTL) probe for a rapid screening of the CN of Pt-SACs. It is disclosed that the CN-triggered CTL is attributed to the fact that the increased CN could induce the downward shift of d-band center position, which assists the acetone adsorption and promotes the subsequent catalytic reaction. In addition, the universality of the proposed acetone-CTL probe is verified by determining the CN of Fe-SACs. This work has opened a new avenue for exploring an alternative to synchrotron XAS for the determination of CN of SACs and even conventional metal catalysts through d-band center-regulated CTL.",

        "Abstract": "Turbulent motion is the essential difference between the atmospheric boundary layer and the free atmosphere. Due to the lack of detection methods for vertical turbulent structures, commonly used methods usually focus on material distribution, thermal effects, or dynamic effects, and they fail to reflect the boundary layer objectively in terms of turbulence. Therefore, to date, the acquisition and characteristic analysis of the atmospheric boundary layer height under turbulent angles have not been achieved. This study proposes a method for obtaining the height of the boundary layer based on the power-law exponent of atmospheric turbulence. The proposed method is validated and analyzed with data from radiosondes obtained under sunny, cloudy, and light rain weather conditions, demonstrating its advantages. With the proposed method, the first published acquisition of boundary layer height characteristics based on turbulent motion is achieved, including a statistical analysis of the daily and monthly variation characteristics of the boundary layer height over the Shenzhen area in China. Moreover, different oscillation frequencies of the boundary layer height under different wind directions are revealed. The results of this study break the traditional bottleneck of not being able to obtain the height of the boundary layer based on turbulence, and provide a new perspective for the acquisition and research of the boundary layer height.",

        "Abstract": "The Single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing (scATAC-seq) has gained increasing popularity in recent years, allowing for chromatin accessibility to be deciphered and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to be inferred at single-cell resolution. This cutting-edge technology now enables the genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility at the cellular level and the capturing of cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that are masked by cellular heterogeneity in bulk assays. Additionally, it can also facilitate the identification of rare and new cell types based on differences in chromatin accessibility and the charting of cellular developmental trajectories within lineage-related cell clusters. Due to technical challenges and limitations, the data generated from scATAC-seq exhibit unique features, often characterized by high sparsity and noise, even within the same cell type. To address these challenges, various bioinformatic tools have been developed. Furthermore, the application of scATAC-seq in plant science is still in its infancy, with most research focusing on root tissues and model plant species. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in scATAC-seq and its application across various fields. We first conduct scATAC-seq in plant science. Next, we highlight the current challenges of scATAC-seq in plant science and major strategies for cell type annotation.

        "Abstract": "Genomic instability can trigger cancer-intrinsic innate immune responses that promote tumor rejection. However, cancer cells often evade these responses by overexpressing immune checkpoint regulators, such as PD-L1. Here, we identify the SNF2-family DNA translocase SMARCAL1 as a factor that favors tumor immune evasion by a dual mechanism involving both the suppression of innate immune signaling and the induction of PD-L1-mediated immune checkpoint responses. Mechanistically, SMARCAL1 limits endogenous DNA damage, thereby suppressing cGAS-STING-dependent signaling during cancer cell growth. Simultaneously, it cooperates with the AP-1 family member JUN to maintain chromatin accessibility at a PD-L1 transcriptional regulatory element, thereby promoting PD-L1 expression in cancer cells. SMARCAL1 loss hinders the ability of tumor cells to induce PD-L1 in response to genomic instability, enhances anti-tumor immune responses and sensitizes tumors to immune checkpoint blockade in a mouse melanoma model. Collectively, these studies uncover SMARCAL1 as a promising target for cancer immunotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive and rare form of breast cancer with a poor prognosis. The occurrence of bilateral IBC in a short period of time is extremely rare. In this case report, a 54-year-old woman diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast underwent lumpectomy, lymph node dissection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy but opted against trastuzumab treatment. Four years later, she experienced bilateral breast inflammation, skin changes, edema, and heat (calor). Biopsies confirmed breast cancer metastasis to both breasts. Whole-Exome Sequencing revealed genetic mutations, including PIK3CA and C4orf54, in both primary and recurrent tumors, with significant downregulation in the recurrent tumors. KEGG analysis suggested potential enrichment of axon guidance signal pathways in both tumors. The patient showed a partial response after treatment with liposome paclitaxel, along with targeted therapy using trastuzumab and pertuzumab. This case report sheds light on the rare occurrence of bilateral inflammatory breast cancer post-HER-2 treatment and highlights the importance of genetic profiling in understanding the disease. Further research on clinical targets for breast cancer management is warranted.",

        "Abstract": "Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is associated with the release of damage-associated molecular patterns, including ATP, to promote an effective immune cycle against tumors. However, tumors have evolved an effective strategy for degrading extracellular immunostimulatory ATP via the ATP-adenosine axis, allowing the sequential action of the ectonucleotidases CD39 to degrade accumulated immunostimulatory ATP into pleiotropic immunosuppressive adenosine. Here, an ingenious dissolving microneedle patch (DMNs) is designed for the intralesional delivery of CD39 inhibitor (sodium polyoxotungstate, POM-1) and ICD inducer (IR780) co-encapsulated solid lipid nanoparticles (P/I SLNs) for antitumor therapy. Upon insertion into the tumor site, IR780 induces ICD modalities with the release of damage-associated molecular patterns from endogenous tissues, which activates the antitumor immune cycle. Simultaneously, POM-1 promotes the liberation of immunostimulatory ATP and lowers the level of immunosuppressive extracellular adenosine, which supported immune control of tumors via recruiting CD39-expressing immune cells. In vivo antitumor studies prove that this platform can effectively eliminate mice melanoma (tumor growth inhibitory rate of 96.5%) and colorectal adenocarcinoma (tumor growth inhibitory rate of 93.5%). Our results shed light on the immunological aspects of combinatorial phototherapy and ATP-adenosine regulation, which will broaden the scope of synergistic antitumor immunotherapy.",

However, the passive drug delivery mode and low drug loading of MNs often result in unsatisfactory therapeutic efficiency.

Specifically, free rivastigmine (RVT) and RVT particles were co-loaded within the MNs to construct the valve and chambers of the guava, respectively, which can serve as an active engine to promote drug permeation by generating capillary force.

        "Abstract": "It remains a significant challenge to develop a kind of cost-effective and eco-friendly adsorbent with strong immobilization capabilities for ammonium in farmland. In this work, we employed Ca/Al layered double hydroxide-supported carbon dots (CDs@Ca/Al-LDHs) as a novel and efficient adsorbent for ammonium immobilization both in aqueous and soil environments. Such a composite could exhibit a high adsorption capacity towards ammonium in solution, which was four times higher than zeolite and three times higher than biochar under the same conditions. The mechanism investigations revealed that electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged CDs and the positively charged ammonium played a key role in the adsorption. In 30-day leaching experiments, the fabricated composite cumulatively reduced ammonium and nitrate by 6.3% and 9.7%, respectively at a dosage of 0.1% (w/w). Incubation experiments further confirmed that the developed composite could effectively inhibit ammonia volatilization and nitrification by immobilizing the ammonium within soil matrices. Our results demonstrated that CDs@Ca/Al-LDHs represented a promising candidate for cost-effective and eco-friendly immobilization of excess ammonium from over-fertilized farmland.",

However, conventional thrombolytic therapies are subjected to narrow therapeutic window, short circulation half-life and bleeding. Herein, we rationally design and develop a safe and efficient nonpharmaceutical thrombolysis strategy based on a specific piezocatalytic effect arising from platelet membrane (PM)-conjugated two-dimensional (2D) piezoelectric selenene, Se-PM nanosheets (NSs). The 2D selenene is fabricated from nonlayered bulk selenium powder by a facile liquid-phase exfoliation method, and the PM conjugation confers selenene with the distinct thrombus-homing feature. Under ultrasonic activation, the piezoelectric characteristic of selenene triggers electrons and holes separation, resulting in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by reacting with surrounding H",

Here, we identified four unreported variants in ARL13B in two patients with the classical features of JBTS. ARL13B is a member of the Ras GTPase family and functions in ciliogenesis and cilia-related signaling. The two missense variants in ARL13B harbored the substitutions of amino acids at evolutionarily conserved positions. Using model cell lines, we found that the accumulations of the missense variants in cilia were impaired and the variants showed attenuated functions in ciliogenesis or the trafficking of INPP5E. Overall, these findings expanded the ARL13B pathogenetic variant spectrum of JBTS.",

        "Abstract": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a prevalent orthopedic issue, leading to the collapse and fragmentation of the femoral head in its advanced stages, which can severely impair patients' quality of life. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a clinical intervention frequently used to alleviate ONFH symptoms and reinstate hip functionality. The conventional surgical technique is invasive and comes with an extended recuperation period, posing significant challenges for patients. With the progression of medical technology, the use of the mini-incision technique in minimally invasive THA (MITHA) has become more prevalent. However, comparative studies examining the effectiveness of these two surgical procedures in treating ONFH remain scarce. Furthermore, understanding patients' psychological well-being is crucial given its profound influence on postoperative recuperation.",

        "Abstract": "Water in organic solvents is a prevalent impurity that significantly influences chemical reactions and industrial processes. Carbon dots (CDs) gained attention as promising tools for chemosensing due to their advantageous characteristics, including easy synthesis, cost-effectiveness, and excellent adjustability and stability. However, limited solubility in water and turn off fluorescence response mode hinder the practical utilization of CDs for water sensing. To tackle such dilemma, a highly water-soluble CDs with distinctive hydrogen-bond-induced emission (HBIE) was rationally designed through introducing sulfone group into the widely employed p-phenylenediamine precursor. The inclusion of sulfone group imparts the CDs with notable water solubility, as well as distinctive ratiometric fluorescent response towards water content, exhibiting high sensitivity and selectivity. Upon exposure to water, the emission color of CDs undergoes a real-time transition from blue to yellow-green, which can be readily discerned by naked eyes. The CDs have been successfully applied in detecting water in commercially available alcohol.

        "Abstract": "The interplay between metabolism and chromatin signaling is implicated in cancer progression. However, whether and how metabolic reprogramming in tumors generates chromatin vulnerabilities remain unclear. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors frequently harbor aberrant activation of the NRF2 antioxidant pathway, which drives aggressive and chemo-resistant disease. Using a chromatin-focused CRISPR screen, we report that NRF2 activation sensitizes LUAD cells to genetic and chemical inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs). This association is observed across cultured cells, mouse models, and patient-derived xenografts. Integrative epigenomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analysis demonstrates that HDAC inhibition causes widespread redistribution of H4ac and its reader protein, which transcriptionally downregulates metabolic enzymes. This results in reduced flux into amino acid metabolism and de novo nucleotide synthesis pathways that are preferentially required for the survival of NRF2-active cancer cells. Together, our findings suggest NRF2 activation as a potential biomarker for effective repurposing of HDAC inhibitors to treat solid tumors.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to understand the prevalence of hyperuricemia and MetS in the United States and evaluate the potential effect of gender and ethnicity on hyperuricemia and MetS. Data was obtained from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2011 and 2018. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to investigate the association between hyperuricemia and MetS. A total of 7273 participants with an average age of 47.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.92\u00a0years old were enrolled in our analysis. Of all the people, 1833 were diagnosed with MetS, with which 547 (29.8\u00a0%) were found with hyperuricemia. As for gender, 261 (28.3\u00a0%) females were with both Mets and hyperuricemia and this number came to 286 (31.4\u00a0%) for males.For population distribution, Non-Hispanic American white, and Hispanic American making up 61.2\u00a0% of the cohort. The logistic regression analysis showed that there was a significant association between MetS and hyperuricemia (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.608, 95\u00a0%CI: 2.281-2.982). And the relationship still existed between both males (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.172, 95\u00a0%CI: 1.829-2.579) and females (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.464, 95\u00a0%CI: 2.868-4.185); in addition, participant's ethnicity was also found to play an important role. And the association was found either in Hispanic Americans Non-Hispanic Americans White and black or from other races. In conclusion, our study found a significant association between hyperuricemia and MetS. The higher the uric acid level, the greater risk of people getting MetS and this risk was not influenced by people's gender and ethnicity.",

        "Abstract": "Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated histone H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) recruits canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) to maintain heterochromatin. In early development, polycomb-regulated genes are connected through long-range 3D interactions which resolve upon differentiation. Here, we report that polycomb looping is controlled by H3K27me3 spreading and regulates target gene silencing and cell fate specification. Using glioma-derived H3 Lys-27-Met (H3K27M) mutations as tools to restrict H3K27me3 deposition, we show that H3K27me3 confinement concentrates the chromatin pool of cPRC1, resulting in heightened 3D interactions mirroring chromatin architecture of pluripotency, and stringent gene repression that maintains cells in progenitor states to facilitate tumor development. Conversely, H3K27me3 spread in pluripotent stem cells, following neural differentiation or loss of the H3K36 methyltransferase NSD1, dilutes cPRC1 concentration and dissolves polycomb loops. These results identify the regulatory principles and disease implications of polycomb looping and nominate histone modification-guided distribution of reader complexes as an important mechanism for nuclear compartment organization.",

        "Abstract": "The emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) is the leading cause of mortality in patients with breast cancer. Overexpressed P-glycoprotein (P-gp) that can pump out chemotherapeutics from multidrug-resistant cancer cells is the main cause of chemotherapy failure. P-gp inhibitors are hence increasingly used to sensitize chemotherapy to breast cancer with MDR by reducing the efflux of drugs. However, representative P-gp inhibitors usually have severe side effects and the effect of their release behavior on chemotherapy are neglected in current studies. We constructed a nano-in-thermogel delivery system with the sequential release of ginsenoside Rh2 (GRh2) and a chemotherapeutic drug in the tumor microenvironment as a drug compounding \"reservoir\" to combat MDR in breast cancer. Briefly, paclitaxel (PTX) and GRh2 were encapsulated in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and dispersed in a poloxamer-based thermogel (SLNs-Gel). GRh2 was used as an innovative and safe P-gp inhibitor to lower P-gp expression and cellular adenosine triphosphate context, thereby sensitizing PTX-resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7/PTX) to PTX. Pharmacodynamic and in vivo safety studies confirmed that intratumoral injection of SLNs-Gel significantly suppressed the proliferation of PTX-resistant breast cancer and alleviated the PTX-induced hematotoxicity. The GRh2-irrigated nano-in-thermogel delivery system shows great potential in combating multidrug-resistant cancer.",

        "Title": "Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites: From Material Engineering to Flexible Applications.",
        "Abstract": "ConspectusIonic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs) are one kind of artificial muscles that can realize energy conversions in response to external stimulus with merits of lightweight, scalability, quick response, and flexibility and have been treated as an important platform in artificial intelligence, such as bionic robotics, smart sensors, and micro-electromechanical systems. It is well-known that IPMC devices are mainly composed of one electrolyte layer laminated with symmetric electrode layers and realize energy conversion based on ion migration and redistribution inside the devices. However, several critical issues have greatly impeded the practical applications of IPMC devices, including metal electrode cracks, metal-polymer interface detachment, and water loss in the electrolyte. In the past decade, our group and collaborators have made attempts to address the mentioned critical issues with the purpose of accelerating practical applications of IPMC devices. First, in order to address the metal electrode cracks, we have developed various electrode materials to replace the metal electrode material, such as black phosphorus and graphdiyne. These materials display superior electrical and mechanical properties with enhanced material stability without cracking. Second, to address metal-polymer interface detachment, we have designed robust interfaces for IMPC devices with vertical array structures. The as-prepared interfaces present high ionic conductivity with excellent mechanical stability under bending states. As a result, the IPMC devices deliver high working stability exceeding a million cycles under air conditions. Third, in order to avoid water loss in the electrolyte, especially at ambient conditions, we have developed ionogel electrolytes containing highly stable ionic liquids as active ion sources. The ionogel electrolytes effectively prevent water loss in conventional water-containing electrolytes, just like Nafion electrolytes and greatly improve the working stability of IPMC devices. After addressing the key issues of IPMC devices, we finally obtained many high-performing IPMC devices and explored various intelligent applications of them. For instance, we have demonstrated the smart functions of IPMC devices as sensitive strain sensors, such as sign language recognition, handwriting detection, and human muscle monitoring. In addition, we have developed bionic flying robots with a vibration frequency as high as 30 Hz with the aid of high-performance IPMC actuators. A medical catheter based on IPMC actuators has been put forward by our group and can realize multiple degrees of freedom deformation under a low driving voltage of 2.5 V, which presents great potential for application in medical instruments. Lastly, a perspective on critical challenges and future research directions on IPMC materials and devices is highlighted for accelerating practical application.",

        "Title": "Specific intracellular retention of circSKA3 promotes colorectal cancer metastasis by attenuating ubiquitination and degradation of SLUG.",
        "Abstract": "Our previous study demonstrated that tumor-suppressor circular RNAs (circRNAs) can be specifically secreted outside of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells within exosomes to maintain tumor cell fitness. However, whether tumor-driving circRNAs can be specifically retained in cells to facilitate tumor progression remains unknown. In this study, circRNA-seq showed that circSKA3 was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues but downregulated in serum samples from CRC patients. In addition, circSKA3 promoted CRC progression in vitro and in vivo and was retained in CRC cells via a specific cellmotif element. Interestingly, the cellmotif element was also the site of interaction of circSKA3 with SLUG, which inhibited SLUG ubiquitination degradation and promoted CRC epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, FUS was identified as a key circularization regulator of circSKA3 that bound to the key element. Finally, we designed and synthesized specific antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting circularization and cellmotif elements, which repressed circSKA3 expression, abolished the SLUG-circSKA3 interaction, and further inhibited CRC EMT and metastasis in vitro and in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "In our previous studies, we demonstrated that merazin hydrate (MH) had rapid antidepressant effects, but the deep mechanism needed to be further investigated. In this study, we used depressive-like model, behavioral tests, molecular biology and pharmacological interventions to reveal the underlying mechanisms of MH's rapid antidepressants. We found that a single administration of MH was able to produce rapid antidepressant effects in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) exposed mice at 1\u00a0day later, similar to ketamine. Moreover, MH could not only significantly up-regulated the expressions of cFOS, but also obviously increased the number of Ki67 positive cells in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Furthermore, we also found that the phosphorylated expression of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was significantly reduced by CUMS in hippocampus, which was also reversed by MH. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII by using KN-93 (a CaMKII antagonist) blocked the MH's up-regulation of cFOS and Ki67 in hippocampal DG. To sum up, this study demonstrated that MH produced rapid antidepressant effects by activating CaMKII to promote neuronal activities and proliferation in hippocampus.",

        "Abstract": "Computational techniques can speed up the identification of hits and accelerate the development of candidate molecules for drug discovery. Among techniques for predicting relative binding affinities, the most consistently accurate is free energy perturbation (FEP), a class of rigorous physics-based methods. However, uncertainty remains about how accurate FEP is and can ever be. Here, we present what we believe to be the largest publicly available dataset of proteins and congeneric series of small molecules, and assess the accuracy of the leading FEP workflow. To ascertain the limit of achievable accuracy, we also survey the reproducibility of experimental relative affinity measurements. We find a wide variability in experimental accuracy and a correspondence between binding and functional assays. When careful preparation of protein and ligand structures is undertaken, FEP can achieve accuracy comparable to experimental reproducibility. Throughout, we highlight reliable protocols that can help maximize the accuracy of FEP in prospective studies.",

        "Abstract": "Endometriosis is a common inflammatory disease in women of reproductive age and is highly associated with infertility. However, the molecular mechanism of endometriosis remains unclear. 6-Phosphofructose-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) is a key enzyme in glycolysis and plays an important regulatory role in the development of cancer. Here we found that PFKFB3 is highly expressed in endometriotic tissues. PFKFB3 promotes the proliferation and growth of endometriosis cells. Meanwhile, PFKFB3 promotes glycolysis in endometriosis cells. Furthermore, PFKFB3 promotes migration and invasion of endometriosis cells. On this basis, we found that PFKFB3 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in endometriosis cells. PFKFB3 interacts with the essential factor of EMT, \u03b2-catenin, and promotes the protein stability of \u03b2-catenin. In addition, the PFKFB3 inhibitor PFK-015 inhibites the growth of endometriosis cells and the development of endometrial tissue. In conclusion, our study shows that PFKFB3 plays an important role in the development of endometriosis and provides new ideas for the clinical diagnosis or treatment of endometriosis.",

        "Abstract": "Rapid and accurate detection of rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in human blood still remains a challenge. We present a surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) method based on aptamer-SERS bio-probe recognition coupled with micropore membrane filtration capture for the detection of CTCs at single cell level. The parylene micropore membrane with optimized micropore size installed on a filtration holder could capture bio-probe labeled CTCs by gravity in less than 10\u00a0s, and only with very less white blood cells (WBCs) residual. In order to facilitate the synthesis of the aptamer-SERS bio-probe, ethyl acetate dehydration method was established. The bio-probe can be rapidly synthesized within 2\u00a0h by binding SH-aptamer to 4- mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) modified AuNPs with the help of ethyl acetate. The SERS bio-probe with selected specific aptamer could distinguish single human non-small cell lung cancer A549\u00a0cells from residual WBCs on membrane efficiently and reliably based on their Raman signal intensity difference at 1075\u00a0cm",

        "Abstract": "Psoriasis and diabetes are both common comorbidities for each other, where inflammation and insulin resistance act in a vicious cycle, driving the progression of disease through the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Therefore, disrupting the linkage between inflammation and insulin resistance by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB pathway presents a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing psoriasis-diabetic comorbidity. Herein, an open-loop therapy was developed by integrating microneedle-mediated short- and long-range missiles to target psoriasis and diabetes, respectively. The short-range missile (curcumin nanoparticle) could be stationed in the psoriatic skin for topical and prolonged antipsoriasis therapy, while the long-range missile (metformin) is capable of penetrating transdermal barriers to induce a systemic hypoglycemic effect. More attractively, the short- and long-range missiles could join hands to inhibit the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and diminish inflammation, effectively disrupting the crosstalk between inflammation and insulin resistance. Pharmacodynamic studies showed that this microneedle-mediated combination, possessing dual anti-inflammatory and antihyperglycemic properties, proves to be highly efficacious in alleviating typical symptoms and inflammatory response in both nondiabetic and diabetic mice with imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis models. Hence, the microneedle-mediated open-loop therapy shows great potential in the management of psoriasis-diabetes comorbidity.",

        "Abstract": "The selective recognition of dopamine (DA) over other neurotransmitter analogues is difficult due to the similar molecular structure and chemical reactivity. In this study, substitution-regulated chemical reactivity of the sensing substrate is utilized to explore a novel DA detection probe with satisfying selectivity. As a case study, 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA, carboxy-substituted resorcinol)-based probes have been explored for selective and ratiometric DA sensing. The carboxy substitution benefits the stabilization of the carbanion intermediate and the azamonardine product, which enhances the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics and subsequently facilitates selective DA recognition over other analogues and interferents. By exploring DHBA emission as the internal reference, ratiometric fluorescence variation is realized, which contributes to sensitive DA analysis. With the combination of logic gate and fluorometric analysis, DA detection in both low and high concentrations can be readily achieved. In addition, the DA analysis in biological samples and the enzymatic transformation of DA analogues in cerebrospinal fluid samples are achieved by the proposed DHBA probe.",

Soil bacterial community structure plays an important role in vegetable residue return and is susceptible to environmental changes. Therefore, understanding the influences of different soil water holding capacities on plant residue decomposition and soil bacterial communities is important for biodegradation. During the whole incubation period, the weight loss ratio of plant residue with 100% water holding capacity was 69.60 to 75.27%, which was significantly higher than that with 60% water holding capacity in clay and sandy soil, indicating that high water holding capacity promoted the decomposition of plant residue. The degradation of lignin and cellulose was also promoted within 14 days. Furthermore, with the increase in soil water holding capacity, the contents of NH",

        "Abstract": "Environmental 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) can cause potential harm to ecological balance and human health. Novosphingobium sp. ES2-1 is an E2-degrading bacterium previously obtained, which converts E2 to estrone (E1) and then to 4-hydroxyestrone (4-OH-E1) followed by oxidation to form metabolites with long-chain structure during upstream degradation. Herein, we found that intracellular enzymes were the major contributors to E2 biodegradation by strain ES2-1. A total of 243 proteins were dys-expressed under E2 condition, 123 were up-regulated and 120 were down-regulated thereinto. The up-regulated members of ABC transport systems, aromatics degradation, and fatty acid degradation indicated a reinforced transfer and utilization of E2. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (EstP1), 2-keto-4-pentenoate hydratase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, TonB-dependent receptor were involved in E2 catabolism. During downstream degradation, the metabolites with long-chain structure were decomposed adopting \u03b2-oxidation pattern and ultimately entered the TCA cycle; 2-keto-4-pentenoic acid might be an emblematic product of such process. Furthermore, E2 converting to E1 was catalyzed by 17\u03b2-dehydrogenase probably encoded by IM701_16645 or IM701_16910; 4-OH-E1 meta-cleavage was catalyzed by a dioxygenase encoded by IM701_20340 or IM701_21000 or IM701_09625. Our study provided an in-depth insight into the adaptive responses and metabolic strategies of Novosphingobium to E2.",

The sensing probe consists of a section of hollow core Bragg fiber (HCBF) spliced with a single-mode fiber pigtail. The end-face of the HCBF is coated with Chitosan and ultraviolet optical adhesive (UVOA), forming two polymer layers using a well-designed fabrication process. The surfaces of the layers and splicing point will generate multiple-beam interference and form Vernier-effect (VE) related envelopes in the reflection spectrum. A signal processing (SP) method is proposed to demodulate the VE envelopes from a complicated superimposed raw spectrum. The principle of the SP algorithm is analyzed theoretically and verified experimentally. The sensor's RH and temperature response are studied, exhibiting a high sensitivity of about 0.437 nm/%RH and 0.29 nm/ ",

Here, we show that serine starvation, a metabolic stress often found in breast cancer, represses estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) signaling by reprogramming glucose metabolism and epigenetics. Using isotope tracing and time-resolved metabolomic analyses, we demonstrate that serine is required to maintain glucose flux through glycolysis and the TCA cycle to support acetyl-CoA generation for histone acetylation. Consequently, limiting serine depletes histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), particularly at the promoter region of ER pathway genes including the gene encoding ER\u03b1, ",

By employing a quantitative control method of fluid velocity through the deformation of an elastic PDMS membrane, this platform mimics the passive breathing process in humans and allows for precise simulation of the respiration cycle. We utilized time-lapse photography of fluorescent particles in a water/glycerol solution to qualitatively observe fluid morphology in the channel, while a chip-aerosol exposure device combined with microscopy imaging was employed to visualise aerosol deposition. Both experimental and numerical simulation results showed that particle concentration decreased towards the distal generations of the lung, and that changes in breathing pattern significantly affected particle deposition trends. Furthermore, we found that increasing the residence time of particles in the channel facilitated deeper particle deposition, achievable by adjusting parameters such as breath-hold time, exhalation time, respiration cycle length, and tidal volume. The proposed microfluidic lung chip device has significant potential for future research in respiratory health and inhaled drug delivery, providing an efficient, cost-effective, and ethical alternative to traditional ",

        "Abstract": "TP53 mutations are frequent in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and other SCCs and are associated with a proclivity for metastasis. Here, we report that colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) expression is upregulated significantly in a p53-R172H-dependent manner in metastatic lung lesions of ESCC. The p53-R172H-dependent CSF-1 signaling, through its cognate receptor CSF-1R, increases tumor cell invasion and lung metastasis, which in turn is mediated in part through Stat3 phosphorylation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In Trp53R172H tumor cells, p53 occupies the Csf-1 promoter. The Csf-1 locus is enriched with histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), which is likely permissive for fostering an interaction between bromodomain-containing domain 4 (BRD4) and p53-R172H to regulate Csf-1 transcription. Inhibition of BRD4 not only reduces tumor invasion and lung metastasis but also reduces circulating CSF-1 levels. Overall, our results establish a novel p53-R172H-dependent BRD4-CSF-1 axis that promotes ESCC lung metastasis and suggest avenues for therapeutic strategies for this difficult-to-treat disease.",

        "Abstract": "SUV420H1 di- and tri-methylates histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me2/H4K20me3) and plays crucial roles in DNA replication, repair, and heterochromatin formation. It is dysregulated in several cancers. Many of these processes were linked to its catalytic activity. However, deletion and inhibition of SUV420H1 have shown distinct phenotypes, suggesting that the enzyme likely has uncharacterized non-catalytic activities. Our cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), biochemical, biophysical, and cellular analyses reveal how SUV420H1 recognizes its nucleosome substrates, and how histone variant H2A.Z stimulates its catalytic activity. SUV420H1 binding to nucleosomes causes a dramatic detachment of nucleosomal DNA from the histone octamer, which is a non-catalytic activity. We hypothesize that this regulates the accessibility of large macromolecular complexes to chromatin. We show that SUV420H1 can promote chromatin condensation, another non-catalytic activity that we speculate is needed for its heterochromatin functions. Together, our studies uncover and characterize the catalytic and non-catalytic mechanisms of SUV420H1, a key histone methyltransferase that plays an essential role in genomic stability.",

Herein, we discovered that WTAP was outstandingly upregulated in chondrocyte stimulated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cartilage tissue of patients with OA. Functional studies have demonstrated that WTAP knockdown enhances proliferation ability, suppresses apoptosis, and reduces extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation in an LPS-induced OA chondrocyte injury model and ameliorates cartilage damage in a destabilizing the medial meniscus (DMM)-induced OA mice model. Conversely, overexpression of WTAP contributes to the opposite effects. Mechanistically, our data has demonstrated that m",

        "Abstract": "Histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub) is monoubiquitinated by Polycomb repressive complex 1 and deubiquitinated by Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase complex (PR-DUB). PR-DUB cleaves H2AK119Ub to restrict focal H2AK119Ub at Polycomb target sites and to protect active genes from aberrant silencing. The PR-DUB subunits (BAP1 and ASXL1) are among the most frequently mutated epigenetic factors in human cancers. How PR-DUB establishes specificity for H2AK119Ub over other nucleosomal ubiquitination sites and how disease-associated mutations of the enzyme affect activity are unclear. Here, we determine a cryo-EM structure of human BAP1 and the ASXL1 DEUBAD in complex with a H2AK119Ub nucleosome. Our structural, biochemical, and cellular data reveal the molecular interactions of BAP1 and ASXL1 with histones and DNA that are critical for restructuring the nucleosome and thus establishing specificity for H2AK119Ub. These results further provide a molecular explanation for how >50 mutations in BAP1 and ASXL1 found in cancer can dysregulate H2AK119Ub deubiquitination, providing insight into understanding cancer etiology.",

On the premise of selecting appropriate patients, the location of the stimulation contacts in the dorsolateral sensorimotor area of the STN may be an important factor affecting therapeutic effects, but the optimal location remains unclear.

Through the covalent cross-linkage between the organic polyvinyl alcohol and inorganic layered double hydroxide, a polymeric composite with ultralong lifetime up to 1.45\u2009s is acquired based on the inhibited non-radiative transition of chromophores. Simultaneously, decent mechanical strength of 97.9\u2009MPa can be realized for the composite materials due to the dissipated loading stress through the covalent-bond-accommodated interfacial interaction. These cross-linked composites also exhibit flexibility, processability, scalability and phosphorescence responses towards the mechanical deformation. It is anticipated that the proposed covalent click reaction could provide a platform for the design and modulation of composites with multi-functionality and long-term durability.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the radical behaviours during polymer degradation is beneficial to unveil and regulate the degradation pathways of polymers to achieve a sustainable polymer development. However, it is a long-standing challenge to study radical behaviours owing to the ultra-short lifetime of the transient radicals generated during the polymer degradation. In this contribution, we have proposed the radical-triggered luminescence to monitor the radical behaviours during polymer degradation without/with the addition of inorganic additives. It was disclosed that the pure polymers showed a single sigmoidal dynamic curve from peroxy radicals (ROO\u22c5) emissions, leading to the exponential proliferation for the degradation evolution. Alternatively, the degradation pathways with the addition of additives, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with positively charged Al centers, could be modulated into a double sigmoidal dynamics, involving the main product of alkoxy radicals (RO\u22c5) with the activation energy of 40.2\u2005kJ/mol and a small amount of ROO\u22c5 with 76.3\u2005kJ/mol, respectively. Accordingly, the polymers with the additive-regulated pathways could exhibit prominently anti-degradation behaviours. This work is beneficial for the deep understanding of the radical mechanisms during polymer degradation, and for the rational design of anti-degradation polymers.",

        "Abstract": "Interplay between chromatin-associated complexes and modifications critically contribute to the partitioning of epigenome into stable and functionally distinct domains. Yet there is a lack of systematic identification of chromatin crosstalk mechanisms, limiting our understanding of the dynamic transition between chromatin states during development and disease. Here we perform co-dependency mapping of genes using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated fitness screens in pan-cancer cell lines to quantify gene-gene functional relationships. We identify 145 co-dependency modules and further define the molecular context underlying the essentiality of these modules by incorporating mutational, epigenome, gene expression and drug sensitivity profiles of cell lines. These analyses assign new protein complex composition and function, and predict new functional interactions, including an unexpected co-dependency between two transcriptionally counteracting chromatin complexes - polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and MLL-MEN1 complex. We show that PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation regulates the genome-wide distribution of MLL1 and MEN1. In lymphoma cells with EZH2 gain-of-function mutations, the re-localization of MLL-MEN1 complex drives oncogenic gene expression and results in a hypersensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of MEN1. Together, our findings provide a resource for discovery of trans-regulatory interactions as mechanisms of chromatin regulation and potential targets of synthetic lethality.",

        "Abstract": "The successful preparation of supramolecular block copolymers (SBCPs) by living supramolecular assembly technology requires two kinetic systems in which both the seed (nucleus) and heterogenous monomer providers are in non-equilibrium. However, employing simple monomers to construct the SBCPs via this technology is almost impossible because the low spontaneous nucleation barrier of simple molecules prevents the formation of kinetic states. Here, with the help of confinement from layered double hydroxide (LDH), various simple monomers successfully form living supramolecular co-assemblies (LSCA). LDH overcomes a considerable energy barrier to obtain living seeds to support the growth of the inactivated second monomer. The ordered LDH topology is sequentially mapped to the seed, second monomer, and binding sites. Thus, the multidirectional binding sites are endowed with the ability to branch, making the branch length of dendritic LSCA reach its maximum value of 3.5 cm so far. The strategy of universality will guide exploration into the development of multi-function and multi-topology advanced supramolecular co-assemblies.",

        "Abstract": "The U6 promoter is an important element driving sgRNA transcription in the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Seven PqU6 promo-ter sequences were cloned from the gDNA of Panax quinquefolium, and the transcriptional activation ability of the seven promoters was studied. In this study, seven PqU6 promoter sequences with a length of about 1 300 bp were cloned from the adventitious roots of P. quinquefolium cultivated for 5 weeks. Bioinformatics tools were used to analyze the sequence characteristics of PqU6 promoters, and the fusion expression vectors of GUS gene driven by PqU6-P were constructed. Tobacco leaves were transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated method for activity detection. The seven PqU6 promoters were truncated from the 5'-end to reach 283, 287, 279, 289, 295, 289, and 283 bp, respectively. The vectors for detection of promoter activity were constructed with GUS as a reported gene and used to transform P. quinquefolium callus and tobacco leaves. The results showed that seven PqU6 promoter sequences(PqU6-1P to PqU6-7P) were cloned from the gDNA of P. quinquefolium, with the length ranged from 1 246 bp to 1 308 bp. Sequence comparison results showed that the seven PqU6 promoter sequences and the AtU6-P promoter all had USE and TATA boxes, which are essential elements affecting the transcriptional activity of the U6 promoter. The results of GUS staining and enzyme activity test showed that all the seven PqU6 promoters had transcriptional activity. The PqU6-7P with a length of 1 269 bp had the highest transcriptional activity, 1.31 times that of the positive control P-35S. When the seven PqU6 promoters were truncated from the 5'-end(PqU6-1PA to PqU6-7PA), their transcriptional activities were different in tobacco leaves and P. quinquefolium callus. The transcriptional activity of PqU6-7PA promoter(283 bp) was 1.59 times that of AtU6-P promoter(292 bp) when the recipient material was P. quinquefolium callus. The findings provide more ideal endogenous U6 promoters for CRISPR/Cas9 technology in ginseng and other medicinal plants.",

        "Abstract": "Chromatic dispersion (CD) is always an obstacle to C-band high-speed intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) transmissions, especially with a fiber reach of > 20 km. To reach beyond net-100-Gb/s IM/DD transmission over 50-km standard single mode fiber (SSMF), we for the first time present a CD-aware probabilistically shaped four-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PS-PAM-4) signal transmission scheme with a FIR-filter-based pre-electronic dispersion compensation (FIR-EDC) for C-band IM/DD transmission system. With the help of the FIR-EDC at the transmitter, 100-GBaud PS-PAM-4 signal transmission at 150-Gb/s line rate and 115.2-Gb/s net rate over 50-km SSMF is realized with only feed-forward equalization (FFE) at the receiver side. The superiority of the CD-aware PS-PAM-4 signal transmission scheme over other benchmark schemes has been successfully verified by experiments. Experimental results show that 24.5% improvement of system capacity is obtained by the FIR-EDC-based PS-PAM-4 signal transmission scheme in comparison to the FIR-EDC-based on-off keying (OOK) signal transmission scheme. Compared with the FIR-EDC-based uniform PAM-4 signal transmission scheme or the PS-PAM-4 signal transmission scheme without EDC, the capacity improvement obtained by the FIR-EDC-based PS-PAM-4 signal transmission scheme becomes more profound. The results show the potential and feasibility of such CD-aware PS-PAM-4 signal transmission scheme applied in CD-constrained IM/DD datacenter interconnects.",

        "Abstract": "Rayleigh scattering-based distributed optical fiber sensors with long sensing distance and large dynamic range are highly desired for application scenarios such as vehicle tracking, structure health monitoring, and geological survey. To enlarge the dynamic range, we propose a coherent optical time domain reflectometry (COTDR) based on double-sideband linear frequency modulation (LFM) pulse. By utilizing I/Q demodulation, both the positive and negative frequency band of the Rayleigh backscattering (RBS) signal can be properly demodulated. Consequently, the dynamic range is doubled without increasing the bandwidth of signal generator, photodetector (PD), and oscilloscope. In the experiment, the chirped pulse with 10 \u03bcs pulse width and 498\u2005MHz frequency sweeping range is launched into the sensing fiber. Single-shot strain measurement is achieved over 5\u2005km single-mode fiber with a spatial resolution of 2.5 m and a strain sensitivity of 7.5 p\u03b5/",

        "Abstract": "Homochiral supramolecular assembly (HSA) based on achiral molecules has provided important clues to understand the origin of biological homochirality from the aspect of symmetry breaking. However, planar achiral molecules still face the challenge of forming HSA due to the lack of driving force for twisted stacking, which is a prerequisite for homochirality. Here, with the benefit of the formation of 2D intercalated layered double hydroxide (LDH, host-guest nanomaterials) in vortex motion, planar achiral guest molecules can form the chiral units with spatially asymmetrical structure in the confinement space of LDH. Once the LDH is removed, these chiral units are in a thermodynamic non-equilibrium state, which can be amplified to HSA by self-replicating. Especially, the homochiral bias can be predicted in advance by controlling the vortex direction. Therefore, this study breaks the bottleneck of complicated molecular design and provides a new technology to achieve HSA made of planar achiral molecules with definite handedness.",

        "Abstract": "Wild PAH-contaminated sites struggle to provide continuous and stable monitoring, resulting in the potential risks of contaminated soil utilization could not be evaluated effectively. This work provided a 9-months laboratory simulation which was close to the natural ecological process. These results believed that PAH-degrading bacteria (PDB) preferred to degrade organic extracted PAH (PAH_OS) and fresh bound-PAH (79.36-99.97%). The formation and migration efficiency of PAH binding with HA humic acid (HA) (PAH_HA) was lower than that of PAH binding with fulvic acid (FA) and humin (HM) (PAH_FA and PAH_HM), leading to PAH_HA had more persistent retention and influenced bacterial communities in shallow soils. Besides, phylum Proteobacteria gradually dominated the bacterial community and decreased 12.05-20.48% diversity at all depths during the biological self-purification process. Although the effect of this process enhanced the abundance of 28 genes 16\u00a0s rRNA and three PAH-degrading genes (PDGs) by 5.91-2047.34 times (phe, nahAc and nidA), the top 30 genera maintained their ecological characteristics. This study provided insights into the important influencing factor and mechanism of the biological self-purification processes and discerned the linkages between bacterial communities and environmental variables in the vertical profile, which is important to the isolation and application of PDB and ecological risk assessment.",

The scheme is applicable to any mode basis in the fiber, and it satisfies the needs of low complexity, low power consumption, and high system performance. By employing the proposed MG filter scheme, a total raw bit rate of a 152-Gb/s multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)-free IM/DD co-channel simultaneous transmit and receive system based on two orbital angular momentum (OAM) MGs, each carrying a 38-GBaud four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) signal, is experimentally demonstrated over a 5-km few-mode fiber (FMF). The bit error ratios (BERs) of the two MGs are below the 7% hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) BER threshold at 3.8\u00d710",

        "Abstract": "A number of textile-based fiber optic sensors have recently been proposed for the continuous monitoring of vital signs. However, some of these sensors are likely unsuitable for conducting direct measurements on the torso as they lack elasticity and are inconvenient. This project provides a novel method for creating a force-sensing smart textile by inlaying four silicone-embedded fiber Bragg grating sensors into a knitted undergarment. The applied force was determined within 3 N after transferring the Bragg wavelength. The results show that the sensors embedded in the silicone membranes achieved enhanced sensitivity to force, as well as flexibility and softness. Additionally, by assessing the degree of FBG response to a range of standardized forces, the linearity (R",

        "Abstract": "An important public concern worldwide is soil pollution caused by organophosphorus pesticides and their primary metabolites. To protect the public's health, screening these pollutants on-site and determining their soil bioavailability is important, but doing so is still challenging. This work improved the already-existing organophosphorus pesticide hydrolase (mpd) and transcriptional activator (pobR), and it first designed and constructed a novel biosensor (Escherichia coli BL21/pNP-LacZ) that can precisely detect methyl parathion (MP) and its primary metabolite p-nitrophenol with low background value. To create a paper strip biosensor, E. coli BL21/pNP-LacZ was fixed to filter paper using bio-gel alginate and sensitizer polymyxin B. According to the calibrations of the paper strip biosensor for soil extracts and standard curve, the color intensity of the paper strip biosensor collected by the mobile app may be used to compute the concentration of MP and p-nitrophenol. This method's detection limits were 5.41\u00a0\u00b5g/kg for p-nitrophenol and 9.57\u00a0\u00b5g/kg for MP. The detection of p-nitrophenol and MP in laboratory and field soil samples confirmed this procedure. Paper strip biosensor on-site allows for the semi-quantitative measurement of p-nitrophenol and MP levels in soils in a simple, inexpensive, and portable method.",

        "Title": "Surprisingly Popular-Based Adaptive Memetic Algorithm for Energy-Efficient Distributed Flexible Job Shop Scheduling.",
        "Abstract": "With the development of the economy, distributed manufacturing has gradually become the mainstream production mode. This work aims to solve the energy-efficient distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem (EDFJSP) while simultaneously minimizing makespan and energy consumption. Some gaps are stated following: 1) the previous works usually adopt the memetic algorithm (MA) with variable neighborhood search. However, the local search (LS) operators are inefficient due to strong randomness; 2) the confidence-based adaptive operator selection model follows the experiences of the major crowds, which ignores the efficient operators with low weight, so it can not select the really efficient operator; 3) the previous works lack of efficient strategy to save energy; and 4) the mainstream memetic framework adopts LS to all solutions, which causes the population to converge too quickly and the diversity is extremely reduced. Thus, we propose a surprisingly popular-based adaptive MA (SPAMA) to overcome the above deficiencies. The contributions are as follows: 1) four problem-based LS operators are employed to improve the convergence; 2) a surprisingly popular degree (SPD) feedback-based self-modifying operators selection model is proposed to find the efficient operators with low weight and correct crowd decision making; 3) the full active scheduling decoding is presented to reduce the energy consumption; and 4) an elite strategy is designed to balance the resources between global and LS. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of SPAMA, it is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms on Mk and DP benchmarks. The results demonstrate the superiority of SPAMA to the state-of-art algorithms for solving EDFJSP.",

        "Abstract": "Interplay between metabolism and chromatin signaling have been implicated in cancer initiation and progression. However, whether and how metabolic reprogramming in tumors generates specific epigenetic vulnerabilities remain unclear. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors frequently harbor mutations that cause aberrant activation of the NRF2 antioxidant pathway and drive aggressive and chemo-resistant disease. We performed a chromatin-focused CRISPR screen and report that NRF2 activation sensitized LUAD cells to genetic and chemical inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDAC). This association was consistently observed across cultured cells, syngeneic mouse models and patient-derived xenografts. HDAC inhibition causes widespread increases in histone H4 acetylation (H4ac) at intergenic regions, but also drives re-targeting of H4ac reader protein BRD4 away from promoters with high H4ac levels and transcriptional downregulation of corresponding genes. Integrative epigenomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis demonstrates that these chromatin changes are associated with reduced flux into amino acid metabolism and ",

        "Abstract": "A receive-diversity-aided power-fading compensation (RDA-PFC) scheme is proposed and demonstrated to eliminate the chromatic dispersion (CD)-induced power fading for C-band double-sideband (DSB) intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. By combining the responses before and after a dispersive element using a maximal-ratio combining (MRC) algorithm, the CD-induced power fading dips within the signal bandwidth of around 50\u2005GHz can be effectively compensated for, which results in an up to 17.6-dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement for the fading subcarriers after transmission over 10 km of standard single-mode fiber (SSMF). Using the 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) format, a diversity receiver with the proposed RDA-PFC scheme can support 170.6-Gbit/s OFDM signal transmission over a 10-km SSMF and reduces the bit error rate (BER) by more than an order of magnitude compared with a conventional receiver. Moreover, 208.1-Gbit/s adaptive bit and power loading OFDM signal transmission over a 10-km SSMF is realized by the proposed RDA-PFC scheme, which improves the capacity by 15.3% compared with the case without RDA-PFC at a BER of 3.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910",

        "Abstract": "Cuproptosis is a new form of programmed cell death, which is associated with the mitochondrial TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle. But the functions of cuproptosis in endometriosis progression are still unknown. Here, we find that cuproptosis suppresses the growth of endometriosis cells and the growth of ectopic endometrial tissues in a mouse model. FDX1 as a key regulator in cuproptosis pathway could promote cuproptosis in endometriosis cells. Interestingly, FDX1 interacts with G6PD, and reduces its protein stability, which predominantly affects the cellular redox-regulating systems. Then, the reduced G6PD activity enhances cuproptosis via down-regulating NADPH and GSH levels. Collectively, our study demonstrates that FDX1 mediates cuproptosis in endometriosis via G6PD pathway, resulting in repression of endometriosis cell proliferation and metastasis.",

        "Abstract": "With increasing human awareness of food safety, the replacement of highly toxic pesticides with biocompatible antimicrobials has become a trend. This study proposes a biocontrol microneedle (BMN) to expand the application of the food-grade preservative epsilon-poly-L-lysine (\u03b5-PL) in fruit preservatives by utilizing a dissolving microneedle system. The macromolecular polymer \u03b5-PL not only possesses broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity but also exhibits good mechanical properties. With the addition of a small amount of polyvinyl alcohol, the mechanical strength of the \u03b5-PL-based microneedle patch could be further improved to achieve an enhanced failure force of needles at 1.6 N/needle and induce an approximately 96% insertion rate in citrus fruit pericarps. An ex vivo insertion test revealed that the microneedle tips could be effectively inserted into the citrus fruit pericarp, rapidly dissolve within 3 min, and produce inconspicuous needle holes. Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of BMN was observed to reach approximately 1890 \u03bcg/patch, which is essential for enhancing the concentration-dependent antifungal activity of \u03b5-PL. The drug distribution study has confirmed the feasibility of mediating the local diffusion of EPL in the pericarp through BMN. Therefore, BMN has great potential to reduce the incidence of invasive fungal infections in local areas of citrus fruit pericarp.",

        "Abstract": "Dissolving microneedles (MNs) have emerged as a promising transdermal delivery system, as they integrate the advantages of both injection and transdermal preparations. However, the low drug-loading and limited transdermal delivery efficiency of MNs severely hinder their clinical applications. Microparticle-embedded gas-propelled MNs were developed to simultaneously improve drug-loading and transdermal delivery efficiency. The effects of mold production technologies, micromolding technologies, and formulation parameters on the quality of gas-propelled MNs were systematically studied. Three-dimensional printing technology was found to prepare male mold with the highest accuracy, while female mold made from the silica gel with smaller Shore hardness could obtain a higher demolding needle percentage (",

        "Abstract": "Despite vaccination having the potency to revolutionize disease treatments, some critical issues including lack of safe and effective delivery system, insufficient internalization and ineffective antigen cross-presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) severely hamper its extensive clinical applications. Herein, we developed a whole cell-encapsulated antitumor vaccine microneedle patch (TCV-DMNs) potentiated with transdermal co-delivery of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and autophagy promoter (Tat-beclin 1). After transdermal vaccination with TCV-DMNs, GM-CSF released from DMNs serves as a potent adjuvant to recruit and promote the phagocytosis of antigens by DCs. Subsequently, Tat-beclin 1 promoted DCs maturation and MHC-I-mediated cross-presentation via up-regulated autophagy of DCs. We found that vaccination with TCV-DMNs could not only effectively suppress melanoma challenge, but also lead to regression of established malignancies, followed by a relapse-free survival of >40\u00a0days. Collectively, whole cell-encapsulated microneedle-assisted transdermal vaccination TCV-DMNs in combination with autophagy regulation could induce a robust antitumor immune response via enhancing transdermal delivery efficiency, promoting antigen internalization and cross-presentation, together with boosting T cell activities.",

        "Abstract": "A highly sensitive inline gas pressure sensor based on the hollow core Bragg fiber (HCBF) and harmonic Vernier effect (VE) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. By sandwiching a segment of HCBF between the lead-in single-mode fiber (SMF) and the hollow core fiber (HCF), a cascaded Fabry-Perot interferometer is produced. The lengths of the HCBF and HCF are precisely optimized and controlled to generate the VE, achieving a high sensitivity of the sensor. Meanwhile, a digital signal processing (DSP) algorithm is proposed to research the mechanism of the VE envelope, thus providing an effective way to improve the sensor's dynamic range based on calibrating the order of the dip. Theoretical simulations are investigated and matched well with the experimental results. The proposed sensor exhibits a maximum gas pressure sensitivity of 150.02 nm/MPa with a low temperature cross talk of 0.00235 MPa/ ",

        "Abstract": "Measuring the release dynamics of drug molecules after their delivery to the target organelle is critical to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce side effects. However, it remains challenging to quantitatively monitor subcellular drug release in real time. To address the knowledge gap, a novel gemini fluorescent surfactant capable of forming mitochondria-targeted and redox-responsive nanocarriers is designed. A quantitative F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) platform is fabricated using this mitochondria-anchored fluorescent nanocarrier as a FRET donor and fluorescent drugs as a FRET acceptor. The FRET platform enables real-time measurement of drug release from organelle-targeted nanocarriers. Moreover, the obtained drug release dynamics can evaluate the duration of drug release at the subcellular level, which established a new quantitative method for organelle-targeted drug release. This quantitative FRET platform can compensate for the absent assessment of the targeted release performances of nanocarriers, offering in-depth understanding of the drug release behaviors at the subcellular targets.",

        "Abstract": "The intricate regulation of chromatin plays a key role in controlling genome architecture and accessibility. Histone lysine methyltransferases regulate chromatin by catalyzing the methylation of specific histone residues but are also hypothesized to have equally important non-catalytic roles. SUV420H1 di- and tri-methylates histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me2/me3) and plays crucial roles in DNA replication, repair, and heterochromatin formation, and is dysregulated in several cancers. Many of these processes were linked to its catalytic activity. However, deletion and inhibition of SUV420H1 have shown distinct phenotypes suggesting the enzyme likely has uncharacterized non-catalytic activities. To characterize the catalytic and non-catalytic mechanisms SUV420H1 uses to modify chromatin, we determined cryo- EM structures of SUV420H1 complexes with nucleosomes containing histone H2A or its variant H2A.Z. Our structural, biochemical, biophysical, and cellular analyses reveal how both SUV420H1 recognizes its substrate and H2A.Z stimulates its activity, and show that SUV420H1 binding to nucleosomes causes a dramatic detachment of nucleosomal DNA from histone octamer. We hypothesize that this detachment increases DNA accessibility to large macromolecular complexes, a prerequisite for DNA replication and repair. We also show that SUV420H1 can promote chromatin condensates, another non-catalytic role that we speculate is needed for its heterochromatin functions. Together, our studies uncover and characterize the catalytic and non-catalytic mechanisms of SUV420H1, a key histone methyltransferase that plays an essential role in genomic stability.",

        "Abstract": "Germline histone H3.3 amino acid substitutions, including H3.3G34R/V, cause severe neurodevelopmental syndromes. To understand how these mutations impact brain development, we generated H3.3G34R/V/W knock-in mice and identified strikingly distinct developmental defects for each mutation. H3.3G34R-mutants exhibited progressive microcephaly and neurodegeneration, with abnormal accumulation of disease-associated microglia and concurrent neuronal depletion. G34R severely decreased H3K36me2 on the mutant H3.3 tail, impairing recruitment of DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and its redistribution on chromatin. These changes were concurrent with sustained expression of complement and other innate immune genes possibly through loss of non-CG (CH) methylation and silencing of neuronal gene promoters through aberrant CG methylation. Complement expression in G34R brains may lead to neuroinflammation possibly accounting for progressive neurodegeneration. Our study reveals that H3.3G34-substitutions have differential impact on the epigenome, which underlie the diverse phenotypes observed, and uncovers potential roles for H3K36me2 and DNMT3A-dependent CH-methylation in modulating synaptic pruning and neuroinflammation in post-natal brains.",

        "Abstract": "Piezoionic strain sensors have attracted enormous attention in artificial skin perception because of high sensitivity, lightweight, and flexibility. However, their sensing properties are limited by a weak material interface based on physical adhesion, which usually leads to fast performance deterioration under mechanical conditions. In this work, a bio-inspired interface has been reported based on an in situ growth strategy and then utilized for piezoionic sensor assembly. The robust coupling interface provides fast kinetic of ion transfer and prevents interface slippage under external strains. The as-fabricated sensors give high sensing voltage with high sensitivity. It delivers excellent cycling stability with performance retention above 90% over thousands of bending cycles in air. Further, the sensors have been explored as an effective platform for skin perception, and many detections can be realized within our devices, such as skin touch, eye movement, cheek bulging, and finger movement.",

        "Abstract": "In order to solve the difficulty in localization and poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the angled shear vertical wave (SV wave) electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) in cracks detection of high-temperature carbon steel forgings, a finite element (FE) model of the angled SV wave EMAT detection process was established, and the influence of specimen temperature on the EMAT excitation, propagation, and reception processes was analyzed. A high-temperature resistant angled SV wave EMAT was designed to detect carbon steel from 20 \u00b0C to 500 \u00b0C, and the influence law of the angled SV wave at different temperatures was analyzed. Then a circuit-field coupled FE model of angled SV wave EMAT in the carbon steel detection process based on the Barker code pulse compression technique was established, and the effects of the Barker code element length, impedance matching method, and matching component parameters on the pulse compression effect were analyzed. In addition, the noise suppression effect and the SNR of the crack-reflected wave in the tone-burst excitation method and the Barker code pulse compression technique were compared. The results show that the amplitude of the block-corner reflected wave decreases from 556 mV to 195 mV, and the SNR decreases from 34.9 dB to 23.5 dB when the specimen temperature increases from 20 \u00b0C to 500 \u00b0C. When the temperature is 500 \u00b0C, the SNR of the crack-reflected wave obtained by the Barker code pulse compression technique can be improved by 9.2 dB compared to the tone-burst excitation method with 16 synchronous averages. The study can provide technical and theoretical guidance for online crack detection for high-temperature carbon steel forgings.",

        "Abstract": "The maintenance of gene expression patterns during metazoan development is achieved by the actions of Polycomb group (PcG) complexes. An essential modification marking silenced genes is monoubiquitination of histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub) deposited by the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the non-canonical Polycomb Repressive Complex 1. The Polycomb Repressive Deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex cleaves monoubiquitin from histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub) to restrict focal H2AK119Ub at Polycomb target sites and to protect active genes from aberrant silencing. BAP1 and ASXL1, subunits that form active PR-DUB, are among the most frequently mutated epigenetic factors in human cancers, underscoring their biological importance. How PR-DUB achieves specificity for H2AK119Ub to regulate Polycomb silencing is unknown, and the mechanisms of most of the mutations in BAP1 and ASXL1 found in cancer have not been established. Here we determine a cryo-EM structure of human BAP1 bound to the ASXL1 DEUBAD domain in complex with a H2AK119Ub nucleosome. Our structural, biochemical, and cellular data reveal the molecular interactions of BAP1 and ASXL1 with histones and DNA that are critical for remodeling the nucleosome and thus establishing specificity for H2AK119Ub. These results further provide a molecular explanation for how >50 mutations in BAP1 and ASXL1 found in cancer can dysregulate H2AK119Ub deubiquitination, providing new insight into understanding cancer etiology.",

        "Abstract": "Cocrystallization technology can effectively regulate crystal structure, alter packing mode, and improve physicochemical performances of energetic materials at molecule level. CL-20/HMX cocrystal explosive has high energy density than HMX, but it also exhibits high mechanical sensitivity. To decrease the sensitivity and improve the properties of CL-20/HMX energetic cocrystal, the three-component energetic cocrystal CL-20/HMX/TNAD was designed. The properties of CL-20, CL-20/HMX, and CL-20/HMX/TNAD cocrystal models were predicted. The results show that CL-20/HMX/TNAD cocrystal models have better mechanical properties than CL-20/HMX cocrystal model, implying that the mechanical properties can be effectively improved. The binding energy of CL-20/HMX/TNAD cocrystal models is higher than CL-20/HMX cocrystal model, indicating that the three-component energetic cocrystal is more stable, and the cocrystal model with the ratio 3:4:1 is predicted to be the most stable phase. CL-20/HMX/TNAD cocrystal models have higher value of trigger bond energy than pure CL-20 and CL-20/HMX cocrystal models, meaning that the three-component energetic cocrystal is more insensitive. The crystal density and detonation parameters of CL-20/HMX and CL-20/HMX/TNAD cocrystal models are lower than CL-20, illustrating that the energy density is declined. The CL-20/HMX/TNAD cocrystal has higher energy density than RDX and can be regarded as a potential high energy explosive.",

        "Abstract": "This paper is concerned with an analysis of the electrical conductivity of graphene/cement composites by means of DC (direct current) and AC (alternating current) techniques. Moreover, the micrograph and element composition of composites have been characterized through SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and EDS (energy-dispersive spectrometers) techniques, respectively. Results revealed that a percolation transition region \u03a62-\u03a61 (\u03a62 and \u03a61 values are determined as 0.8% and 1.8%, respectively) can be observed in the S-shaped curve. In addition, the logistic model has been recommended to characterize the relationship between the conductivity and the graphene concentration, which ranged from 0.001% to 2.5%. The micrographs obtained by SEM technique clearly indicate a complete conductive network as well as agglomeration of graphene slices when the graphene content reaches the threshold value. Furthermore, graphene slices can be distinguished from the cement hydration products by means of the analysis of element composition obtained through the EDS technique. It is promising to apply the graphene/cement composites as intelligent materials.",

        "Abstract": "Polymers have been widely applied in various fields in the daily routines and the manufacturing. Despite the awareness of the aggressive and inevitable aging for the polymers, it still remains a challenge to choose an appropriate characterization strategy for evaluating the aging behaviors. The difficulties lie in the fact that the polymer features from the different aging stages require different characterization methods. In this review, we present an overview of the characterization strategies preferable for the initial, accelerated, and late stages during polymer aging. The optimum strategies have been discussed to characterize the generation of radicals, variation of functional groups, substantial chain scission, formation of low-molecular products, and deterioration in the polymers' macro-performances. In view of the advantages and the limitations of these characterization techniques, their utilization in a strategic approach is considered. In addition, we highlight the structure-property relationship for the aged polymers and provide available guidance for lifetime prediction. This review could allow the readers to be knowledgeable of the features for the polymers in the different aging stages and provide access to choose the optimum characterization techniques. We believe that this review will attract the communities dedicated to materials science and chemistry.",

        "Abstract": "Skin wound healing is a complex pathophysiological change that is driven by macrophages and their secreted related factors. Depending on the stimuli, macrophages can be polarised into two subtypes of macrophages with completely different phenotypes and functions, namely M1 and M2. The aim of this study was to explore the role of M1 and M2 macrophages in skin healing in order to develop new drugs for the treatment of refractory wounds. Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were isolated from rats and expanded in vitro using macrophage colony stimulating factor. In addition, the BMDMs were polarised into the M1 and M2 subtypes using lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and interleukin-4 (IL-4), respectively. Cytokine levels in the culture supernatants were measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Epidermal wounds were made on the dorsal surface of rats, and treated with M1 or M2 cell suspensions or phosphate buffered saline. Wound healing was recorded on days 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14 after stamping, and the wound healing rate was measured by haematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining. A total of 3 to 4\u00a0\u00d7\u200910",

        "Abstract": "Kerr soliton frequency comb generation in nonlinear microcavities with compact configurations are promising on-chip sources. Current Kerr comb generation by using a single microcavity with a tunable CW pump laser or high-power femtosecond pulse pump are difficult to be integrated on chip. In this paper, we propose an on-chip soliton comb generation scheme by tuning the coupling coefficient of two coupled microcavities instead of tuning the wavelength of the cw pump laser or using a pulsed pump laser in a single microcavity. The two microcavities are assumed to be identical. We showed by numerical simulation that Kerr comb generation is possible in both the blue and red detuned regions of the main microcavity in the coupled cavity system. We further found that the range and boundary of the soliton generation region of the couple microcavities depend on the coupling coefficient between the coupled cavities. To ensure that the modes being coupled have identical optical paths, we designed a Sagnac loop structure which couples the clockwise and counterclockwise modes in a single microcavity and demonstrated Kerr comb generation in both the blue and red detuned regions by tuning the coupling coefficient. The proposed Kerr comb generation scheme can be utilized for chip-scale integrated soliton comb sources, which will contribute to the development of on-chip applications.",

        "Title": "Theoretical investigations of weakly- and strongly-coupled multi-core fibers for the applications of optical submarine communications under power and fiber count limits.",
        "Abstract": "The practical cable design for optical submarine communications has a limited fiber pair count due to the mechanical considerations of cable weight and size. Consequently, multi-core fibers (MCFs) could exhibit higher capacity than conventional single-mode fibers (SMFs) thanks to space division multiplexing (SDM). That is because the power supply to a submarine cable is fed by the voltage difference between shores. Under the power-limited condition, SDM improves the cable capacity by using more paths which outperforms the SMF link whose capacity approximately complies with a logarithmic relationship to optical power. At the same time, fiber nonlinearity can be alleviated by the reduced power density of transmitted light in MCFs, due to the increased spatial diversity and mode coupling among coupled cores. In this work, we theoretically investigate the potentials of MCFs including weakly-coupled multicore fiber (WC-MCF) and strongly-coupled multicore fiber (SC-MCF) as the propagation media for submarine communications across the Atlantic and the Pacific. To fairly compare the performances of SMFs- and MCFs-based submarine cables, the Gaussian noise (GN) model for SDM links is employed to optimize the systematic settings including spatial multiplicity and single span length. Then, we develop an SDM and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) fiber transmission model based on coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations (CNSE) to investigate the optical filed coupling effect in MCFs-based cables. The developed transmission model has been self-examined by measuring the inter-core crosstalk (IC-XT) and spatial mode dispersion (SMD), referring to the set values. As indicated by the theoretical analysis, the WC-MCFs cable exhibits a larger capacity than the SMFs cable, when the fiber pair count is limited below 32. Moreover, the SC-MCFs cable outperforms the WC-MCFs cable thanks to the reduced fiber nonlinearity due to the random mode coupling and the assistance of multiple-input and multiple-output digital signal processing (MIMO-DSP). At last, the marginal influences of IC-XT, SMD, and insertion loss of Fan-in and Fan-out couplers are also analyzed for the MCFs cable.",

        "Title": "Chiral Hierarchical Architecture Induced by Confinement-Assisted Living Supramolecular Polymerization of Simple Achiral Molecules.",
        "Abstract": "Chiral supramolecular assembly (CSA) based on achiral molecules has provided important clues to understand the origin of biological chirality. However, a simple achiral monomer faces the challenge of chiral stacking with the absence of a chiral resource. The difficulty is that simple achiral monomer lacks steric repulsion to provide asymmetry during hierarchical assembly, which is a prerequisite for chiral stacking with an angle. Moreover, during chiral stacking of achiral molecules or units, the right-handed and left-handed chiral supramolecular isomers (CSIs) are equally formed due to the mirror-imaged conformation, which leads to chirality silence. Here, with the benefit of two-dimensional confinement space of layered double hydroxide (LDH), simple achiral molecules can be arranged to staggered bilayer arrays by imprinting the topological structure of LDH. Once LDH is removed, these staggered arrays can form asymmetric living seeds, which can further elongate to living units with the advantage of living supramolecular polymerization (LSP) by following off-pathway. Due to the asymmetry of living units, the possible chiral stacking outcomes, CSIs, are not mirror-imaged. With the increase of the molecular number in living units, the energy difference between CSIs can be amplified by self-replication of LSP, leading to handedness preference. Thus, the detectable CSA is mainly derived from the CSI with energetically favored hierarchical structure. Thus, our strategy breaks the stereotype that the complex molecular structure and symmetry breaking mechanism are necessary for the formation of detectable CSA by achiral molecules.",

        "Abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) outcomes remain stagnant, in part due to a poor understanding of HNSCC biology. The importance of tumor heterogeneity as an independent predictor of outcomes and treatment failure in HNSCC has recently come to light. With this understanding, 3D culture systems, including patient derived organoids (PDO) and organotypic culture (OTC), that capture this heterogeneity may allow for modeling and manipulation of critical subpopulations, such as p-EMT, as well as interactions between cancer cells and immune and stromal cells in the microenvironment. Here, we review work that has been done using PDO and OTC models of HNSCC, which demonstrates that these 3D culture models capture in vivo tumor heterogeneity and can be used to model tumor biology and treatment response in a way that faithfully recapitulates in vivo characteristics. As such, in vitro 3D culture models represent an important bridge between 2D monolayer culture and in vivo models such as patient derived xenografts.",

        "Abstract": "Patatin-related phospholipase A genes were involved in the response of Gossypium hirsutum to drought and salt tolerance. pPLA (patatin-related phospholipase A) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the initial step of lipid hydrolysis, which is involved in biological processes, such as drought, salt stress, and freezing injury. However, a comprehensive analysis of the pPLA gene family in cotton, especially the role of pPLA in the response to drought and salt tolerance, has not been reported so far. A total of 33 pPLA genes were identified in this study using a genome-wide search approach, and phylogenetic analysis classified these genes into three groups. These genes are unevenly distributed on the 26 chromosomes of cotton, and most of them contain a few introns. The results of the collinear analysis showed that G. hirsutum contained 1-5 copies of each pPLA gene found in G. arboreum and G. raimondii. The subcellular localization analysis of Gh_D08G061200 showed that the protein was localized in the nucleus. In addition, analysis of published upland cotton transcriptome data revealed that six GhPLA genes were expressed in various tissues and organs. Two genes (Gh_A04G142100.1 and Gh_D04G181000.1) were highly expressed in all tissues under normal conditions, showing the expression characteristics of housekeeping genes. Under different drought and salt tolerance stresses, we detected four genes with different expression levels. This study helps to clarify the role of pPLA in the response to drought and salt tolerance.",

They have received significant interest due to their excellent fluorescence efficiency in the aggregated state, remarkable processability, and solubility. AIE-active micelles can be designed through the self-assembly of amphipathic AIE luminogens (AIEgens) and the encapsulation of non-emissive amphipathic molecules in AIEgens. Currently, a wide range of AIE-active micelles have been constructed, with a significant increase in research interest in this area. A series of advanced techniques has been used to characterize AIE-active micelles, such as cryogenic-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). This review provides an overview of the synthesis, characterization, and applications of AIE-active micelles, especially their applications in cell and ",

        "Abstract": "Changes in lake area (water surface area) are often considered accurate and sensitive representations of climate change. However, the role that elevation plays in this dynamic is somewhat unclear; studies remain inconclusive as to whether lake responses are consistent across elevation gradients. Here, we used Landsat and keyhole satellite images to quantify lake area changes from the 1960s to 2020 at different elevations in Central Asia's Tianshan Mountains and relate them to both climatic and anthropogenic factors. The results revealed that all low-elevation lakes showed a decreasing trend, and the total area of all monitored low-elevation lakes was reduced by 18.50 %. The total area of the mid-elevation lakes decreased by 0.16 %, while the total area of the high-elevation glacial lakes increased by 4.35 %. Lakes are recharged by a variety of influxes including glacial meltwater and precipitation. Notably, human activities (urban and agricultural water consumption) were the dominant factors in the shrinkage of low-elevation lakes. Climatic factors were the main driving factors of mid-elevation lake changes, and these lakes appeared to be more sensitive to temperature changes than lakes at other elevations. In addition, significant warming dominated area changes in high-elevation proglacial and unconnected glacial lakes. Overall, those results emphasized that when using lakes to reconstruct paleoclimates or predict lake evolution, it is necessary to consider how elevation gradients and recharge types may affect lake sensitivity to variations in climatic and anthropogenic activity.",

        "Title": "Modeling Oral-Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma in 3D Organoids.",
        "Abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is prevalent worldwide, accounting for 90% of all esophageal cancer cases each year, and is the deadliest of all human squamous cell carcinomas. Despite recent progress in defining the molecular changes accompanying ESCC initiation and development, patient prognosis remains poor. The functional annotation of these molecular changes is the necessary next step and requires models that both capture the molecular features of ESCC and can be readily and inexpensively manipulated for functional annotation. Mice treated with the tobacco smoke mimetic 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) predictably form ESCC and esophageal preneoplasia. Of note, 4NQO lesions also arise in the oral cavity, most commonly in the tongue, as well as the forestomach, which all share the stratified squamous epithelium. However, these mice cannot be simply manipulated for functional hypothesis testing, as generating isogenic mouse models is time- and resource-intensive. Herein, we overcome this limitation by generating single cell-derived three-dimensional (3D) organoids from mice treated with 4NQO to characterize murine ESCC or preneoplastic cells ex vivo. These organoids capture the salient features of ESCC and esophageal preneoplasia, can be cheaply and quickly leveraged to form isogenic models, and can be utilized for syngeneic transplantation experiments. We demonstrate how to generate 3D organoids from normal, preneoplastic, and SCC murine esophageal tissue and maintain and cryopreserve these organoids. The applications of these versatile organoids are broad and include the utilization of genetically engineered mice and further characterization by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry, the generation of isogeneic organoid lines using CRISPR technologies, and drug screening or syngeneic transplantation. We believe that the widespread adoption of the techniques demonstrated in this protocol will accelerate progress in this field to combat the severe burden of ESCC.",

        "Abstract": "Food packaging plays a vital role in protecting food products from environmental damage and preventing contamination from microorganisms. Conventional food packaging made of plastics produced from unrenewable fossil resources is hard to degrade and poses a negative impact on environmental sustainability. Natural biopolymers are attracting interest for reducing environmental problems to achieve a sustainable society, because of their abundance, biocompatibility, biodegradability, chemical stability, and non-toxicity. Active packaging systems composed of these biopolymers and biopolymer-based composites go beyond simply acting as a barrier to maintain food quality. This review provides a comprehensive overview of natural biopolymer materials used as matrices for food packaging. The antioxidant, water barrier, and oxygen barrier properties of these composites are compared and discussed. Furthermore, biopolymer-based composites integrated with antimicrobial agents-such as inorganic nanostructures and natural products-are reviewed, and the related mechanisms are discussed in terms of antimicrobial function. In summary, composites used for active food packaging systems can inhibit microbial growth and maintain food quality.",

        "Abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is associated with multiple organ dysfunction and many comorbidities. Its incidence is high among the elderly and is a major health burden worldwide. Cognitive impairment (CI) is highly prevalent in older patients with HF, which is an abnormality in one or more of the items of cognition, attention, memory, language, psychomotor function, and visual spatial acuity. Studies have shown that the incidence of CI in HF patients is between 13 and 54%, and patients with both conditions have poor self-care ability and prognosis, as well as increased mortality rates. However, the mechanisms of CI development in HF patients are still unclear. In this review, we describe the epidemiology and risk factors as well as measures of improving CI in HF patients. We update the latest pathophysiological mechanisms related to the neurocognitive changes in HF patients, expounding on the mechanisms associated with the development of CI in HF patients.",

        "Abstract": "Chromatin dysfunction has been implicated in a growing number of cancers especially in children and young adults. In addition to chromatin modifying and remodeling enzymes, mutations in histone genes are linked to human cancers. Since the first reports of hotspot missense mutations affecting key residues at histone H3 tail, studies have revealed how these so-called \"oncohistones\" dominantly (H3K27M and H3K36M) or locally (H3.3G34R/W) inhibit corresponding histone methyltransferases and misregulate epigenome and transcriptome to promote tumorigenesis. More recently, widespread mutations in all four core histones are identified in diverse cancer types. Furthermore, an \"oncohistone-like\" protein EZHIP has been implicated in driving childhood ependymomas through a mechanism highly reminiscent of H3K27M mutation. We will review recent progresses on understanding the biochemical, molecular and biological mechanisms underlying the canonical and novel histone mutations. Importantly, these mechanistic insights have identified therapeutic opportunities for oncohistone-driven tumors.",

        "Abstract": "Currently, much attention has been paid to the efforts to stabilize and regulate single atoms through supports to obtain decent electrocatalytic behaviors. However, little concern was given to the effect of single atoms on modulating the electronic structure of supports, despite the catalytic activities and large quantities of supports in the catalytic reactions. Herein, we have localized Ru single atoms onto two-dimensional layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) and studied the role of Ru single atoms in adjusting the electronic structure of the NiFe-LDH support. Spin polarization of 3d electrons for Fe and electron redistribution in NiFe-LDH were effectively modulated through the interaction between Ru single atoms and NiFe-LDH. As a result, the luminol redox reaction and reactive oxygen revolution were simultaneously promoted by Ru single-atom-modulated NiFe-LDH, manifested as boosted electrochemiluminescence (ECL). Therefore, we have provided valid information to reveal the regulation effect of single atoms on the spin state and electronic structure of the supports. It is anticipated that our strategy may arouse wide interest in manipulating single-atom-modulated supports.",

        "Abstract": "This study proposes a novel modified sign coherence factor (SCF) weighting adapted to the frequency-domain (FD) beamforming for ultrasound plane-wave imaging to achieve a high frame rate and better image quality. First, before beamforming, the sign components were extracted from the radiofrequency signals of aperture data. Second, the modified SCF was established using the FD beamformed sign components. Finally, the FD beamformed image was weighted by the modified SCF. To assess the performance of the proposed modified SCF for FD beamforming, the resolution, contrast, computation complexity and execution time of the generated images were evaluated. The results revealed that the FD-SCF could significantly improve the computational load compared with the classic delay-and-sum SCF on the premise of equal image quality improvement. Therefore, high image quality and low computational load have been successfully combined under the proposed weighting method.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial metabolism plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes and fibrosis. However, the mechanism underlying mitochondrial metabolic function and liver fibrosis remains poorly understood. In this study, we determined whether mitochondrial metabolism mediates liver fibrosis using cells, animal models, and clinical samples to elucidate the potential effects and underlying mechanism of mitochondrial metabolism in liver fibrosis. We report that AlkB Homolog 5 (ALKBH5) decreases mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR), suppresses mitochondrial fission and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) proliferation and migration and ameliorates liver fibrosis. Enhancement of mitochondrial fission, an essential event during HSC proliferation and migration, is dependent on decreased ALKBH5 expression. Furthermore, we reveal that low ALKBH5 expression is associated with elevated N6-methyladenosine (m",

        "Abstract": "Primary cilia have emerged as the cellular \"antenna\" that can receive and transduce extracellular chemical/physical signals, thus playing an important role in regulating cellular activities. Although the electromagnetic field (EMF) is an effective treatment for bone fractures since 1978, however, the detailed mechanisms leading to such positive effects are still unclear. Primary cilia may play a central role in receiving EMF signals, translating physical signals into biochemical information, and initiating various signalingsignaling pathways to transduce signals into the nucleus. In this review, we elucidated the process of bone healing, the structure, and function of primary cilia, as well as the application and mechanism of EMF in treating fracture healing. To comprehensively understand the process of bone healing, we used bioinformatics to analyze the molecular change and associated the results with other studies. Moreover, this review summarizedsummarized some limitations in EMFs-related research and provides an outlook for ongoing studies. In conclusion, this review illustrated the primary cilia and related molecular mechanisms in the EMF-induced bone healing process, and it may shed light on future research.",

        "Abstract": "Crystallization-induced microscopic stress and its relaxation play a vital role in understanding crystallization behavior and mechanism. However, the real-time measurements for stress and its relaxation seem to be an unachievable task due to difficulties in simultaneous labeling, spatiotemporal discrimination, and continuous quantification. We designed a micron-sized fluorescent probe, whose fluorescence can respond to stress-induced environmental rigidity and whose three-dimensional (3D) flow can respond to stress relaxation. Using the as-prepared fluorescent probe, we established a versatile strategy to realize the real-time 3D imaging of stress and its relaxation in the crystallization process. The rigidity-responsive fluorescence clearly indicated the stress, while the 3D flow movement could quantify the stress relaxation. It is revealed that stress in spherulites increased dramatically as a result of the suppression of stress relaxation in polymer melts. The developed method provides a novel avenue to simultaneously detect stress and its relaxation in various semicrystalline polymers at the single-particle level. This success would achieve the microscopic ways to guide the development of advanced crystallization-dependent materials.",

        "Abstract": "The combination of gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) with surface plasmonic metal nanomaterials is an effective and direct method to improve the photoluminescence efficiency of AuNCs. However, the plasmon-enhanced AuNC luminescence strategies usually utilize silica as the separation layer, which requires further functionalization because the silica layer has no functional groups for in situ bonding of AuNCs. Therefore, it appears as a crucial need to develop an appropriate separation layer for the preparation of plasmon-enhanced AuNC luminescent nanomaterials. In this work, employing bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a novel separation layer, we prepared gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)@BSA@Au",

        "Abstract": "Age-related diseases have become more common with the advancing age of the worldwide population. Such diseases involve multiple organs, with tissue degeneration and cellular apoptosis. To date, there is a general lack of effective drugs for treatment of most age-related diseases and there is therefore an urgent need to identify novel drug targets for improved treatment. Acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) is a degenerin/epithelial sodium channel family member, which is activated in an acidic environment to regulate pathophysiological processes such as acidosis, inflammation, hypoxia, and ischemia. A large body of evidence suggests that ASIC1a plays an important role in the development of age-related diseases (e.g., stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease.). Herein we present: 1) a review of ASIC1a channel properties, distribution, and physiological function; 2) a summary of the pharmacological properties of ASIC1a; 3) and a consideration of ASIC1a as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of age-related disease.",

        "Abstract": "Endometriosis is a common chronic condition characterized by abnormal growth of the endometrium outside the uterus. Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) is a significant regulator of the proteotoxic stress response and plays an essential role in developing endometriosis. However, the mechanisms regulating HSF1 protein stability in endometriosis remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that OTUB1 interacts with HSF1 and promotes HSF1 protein stability through deubiquitination. In addition, OTUB1 enhances glycolysis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of endometriosis cells, leading to promote proliferation, migration, and invasion of endometriosis cells. The progression of endometriosis is inhibited in an OTUB1-knockout mouse model. In summary, OTUB1 promotes the development of endometriosis by up-regulating HSF1. OTUB1/HSF1 axis may become a new therapeutic target for endometriosis.",

        "Abstract": "A highly sensitive relative humidity (RH) sensor based on Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPI) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The sensor is fabricated by splicing a segment of hollow core Bragg fiber (HCBF) with single mode fiber (SMF) and functionalized with chitosan and ultraviolet optical adhesive (UVOA) composite at the end of HCBF to form a hygroscopic polymer film. The reflection beams from the splicing point and the two surfaces of the polymer film generate the Vernier effect in the reflection spectrum, which significantly improves the humidity sensitivity of the sensor. To demodulate the envelope based on the Vernier effect and realize multi-point sensing, a digital signal processing (DSP) algorithm is proposed to process the reflection spectrum. The performance of the DSP algorithm is theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified. The proposed sensor demonstrates a high sensitivity of 1.45 nm/% RH for RH ranging from 45% RH to 90% RH. The compact size, high sensitivity and multiplexing capability make this sensor a promising candidate for RH monitoring. Furthermore, the proposed DSP can potentially be applied to other sensors based on the Vernier effect to analyze and extract valuable information from the interference spectrum.",

Worldwide, endometriosis affects nearly 10\u00a0% of women in their reproductive years and causes a significant decline in quality of life. Despite extensive investigations of endometriosis over the past years, the mechanisms of endometriosis pathogenesis remain unclear. In recent years, metabolic factors have increasingly been considered factors in endometriosis. There is compelling evidence regarding the progress of endometriosis in the context of severe metabolic dysfunction. Hence, the curative strategies and ongoing attempts to conquer endometriosis might start with metabolic pathways. This review focuses on metabolic mechanisms and summarizes current research progress. These findings provide valuable information for the non-intrusive diagnosis of the disease and may contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of endometriosis.",

        "Abstract": "Licochalcone (LicA) is a flavonoid commonly derived from the licorice plant that is reported to have a variety of pharmacological activities. However, few studies have focused on its anti-allergic properties. IgE-mediated passive and systemic anaphylaxis mice models were used to assess the in vivo anti-allergic effect of LicA and its underlying mechanism, while degranulation, cytokines, and chemokines released from laboratory of allergic disease (LAD2) cells were used to assess its in vitro anti-allergic effect. We used western blot analysis to explore the downstream signaling pathway of its anti-allergic effect. We found that in the mouse model, LicA attenuated IgE-mediated paw inflammation, recovered the allergy-induced drop in body temperature, and reduced the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 in mouse serum in a dose-dependent manner. LicA inhibited the allergic reaction via inhibition of IgE-mediated LAD2 cell activation through the PLC/ERK/STAT3 pathway.",

        "Title": "Comparison of low-complexity sparse and weight-sharing nonlinear equalizers for C-band 100-Gbit/s DSB PAM-4 transmission over 60-km SSMF.",
        "Abstract": "To cope with the nonlinear distortions and the chromatic dispersion (CD) induced power fading in double-side band (DSB) intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) transmission systems, high-performance Volterra nonlinear equalizers (VNLEs) including Volterra feed-forward equalizer (VFFE) and Volterra decision-feedback equalizer (VDFE) are widely applied. However, the conventional VNLEs have high computational complexity, especially for longer memory lengths. In this paper, based on sparse and weight-sharing strategies for significant kernel reduction, we propose four low-complexity NLEs including a sparse diagonally pruned VDFE (S-DP-VDFE), a sparse diagonally pruned absolute-term DFE (S-DP-ATDFE), a weight-sharing DP-VDFE (WS-DP-VDFE), and a weight-sharing DP-ATDFE (WS-DP-ATDFE), and present a comprehensive comparison among them in terms of computational complexity and bit error ratio (BER) performance in a C-band 100-Gbit/s PAM-4 transmission system over 60-km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF). The experimental results show that the proposed S-DP-VDFE and WS-DP-VDFE not only exhibit comparable performance with the conventional DP-VDFE but also reduce the complexity by 54.5% and 45.9%, respectively. While the proposed S-DP-ATDFE and WS-DP-ATDFE yield lower complexity at the expense of a slight performance degradation. Compared with the proposed S-DP-VDFE, S-DP-ATDFE, and WS-DP-VDFE, the proposed WS-DP-ATDFE with the lowest number of real-valued multiplications of 45 achieves up to 90.9%, 81.6%, and 95.8% complexity reduction, respectively, at the 7% hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) BER limit of 3.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910",

        "Abstract": "In this work, a circular statistics vector (CSV) weighting Fourier domain (FD) beamforming for ultrasound plane-wave images was proposed to achieve better image quality with a high frame rate. Firstly, the cosine and sine components of the instantaneous phase are extracted from undelayed RF signals. Secondly, the FD beamformed cosine and sine components are used to establish the CSV. Finally, the FD beamformed amplitude image is weighted by the CSV. The resolution, contrast, and computation complexity were used to assess the performance of the proposed method. The results revealed that FD_CSV could significantly reduce the computational load compared to the conventional DAS_CSV on the equal improvement of image quality. Besides, compared to coherence factor (CF), phase coherence factor (PCF), etc., based on variance calculation, the CSV based on mean resultant vector calculation can effectively preserve the speckle due to the more tolerant to phase errors. The proposed FD_CSV weighting method has successfully conducted high image quality and low computational load.",

        "Abstract": "Electro-optic (EO) modulators with a high modulation bandwidth are indispensable parts of an optical interconnect system. A key requirement for an energy-efficient EO modulator is the low drive voltage, which can be provided using a standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor circuity without an amplifying driver. Thin-film lithium niobate has emerged as a new promising platform, and shown its capable of achieving driverless and high-speed EO modulators. In this paper, we report a compact high-performance modulator based on the thin-film lithium niobate platform on a silicon substrate. The periodic capacitively loaded travelling-wave electrode is employed to achieve a large modulation bandwidth and a low drive voltage, which can support a driverless single-lane 100Gbaud operation. The folded modulation section design also helps to reduce the device length by almost two thirds. The fabricated device represents a large EO bandwidth of 45GHz with a half-wave voltage of 0.7V. The driverless transmission of a 100Gbaud 4-level pulse amplitude modulation signal is demonstrated with a power consumption of 4.49fj/bit and a bit-error rate below the KP4 forward-error correction threshold of 2.4\u00d710",

        "Abstract": "Carbon dots (CDs) have excellent optical properties, low toxicity and easy preparation, which have led to them being widely used in biomedicine, sensing and optical devices. However, although great progress has been made in the preparation of CDs, the detailed exploration of their photoluminescence (PL) mechanism is still under debate due to their complex structures and surface functionalities. Here, we proposed a single change in the pH of the synthesis condition, which had no effect on the CDs intrinsic core states and avoided the mutual influence of multiple PL origins. The m-phenylenediamine (m-PD) served as a carbon source, whose protonation degree determined the surface state of the resulting CDs and the accompanying fluorescence characteristics. The as-obtained CDs materials can be applied in the chemical sensor and anti-counterfeiting fields in a targeted manner. Therefore, our work not only contributes to the explanation of the CDs PL mechanism, but also obtains a series of CDs materials with controllable PL properties.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, a high-sensitivity distributed optical fiber salinity sensor based on frequency-scanning phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry (\u03c6-OTDR) and polyimide-coated single-mode fiber is proposed. Distributed salinity sensing over an 1100 m polyimide-coated fiber with a 1 m spatial resolution was demonstrated, and a sensitivity of 782.4\u2005MHz/(mol/L) was achieved with the salinity changing from 0\u2005mol/L to 1.61\u2005mol/L. Then the measurement accuracies of frequency shift and salinity were evaluated theoretically and experimentally. Both theoretical and experimental results show that the measurement accuracy deteriorates as the pulse width decreases, resulting in a trade-off between the spatial resolution and measurement accuracy. The measurement uncertainty of salinity is 0.022\u2005mol/L in the case of 30\u2005cm spatial resolution. And when the spatial resolution is set to be 2 m, the measurement uncertainty of salinity decreases to 0.005\u2005mol/L. The response time of the fiber to external salinity change has also been investigated, and it takes about 8 minutes for the fiber to reach a stable state. The proposed salinity sensor exhibits high sensitivity and long measurement range, which may be used for distributed marine environmental monitoring.",

        "Title": "Histone methylation antagonism drives tumor immune evasion in squamous cell carcinomas.",
        "Abstract": "How cancer-associated chromatin abnormalities shape tumor-immune interaction remains incompletely understood. Recent studies have linked DNA hypomethylation and de-repression of retrotransposons to anti-tumor immunity through the induction of interferon response. Here, we report that inactivation of the histone H3K36 methyltransferase NSD1, which is frequently found in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and induces DNA hypomethylation, unexpectedly results in diminished tumor immune infiltration. In syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse models of head and neck SCCs, NSD1-deficient tumors exhibit immune exclusion and reduced interferon response despite high retrotransposon expression. Mechanistically, NSD1 loss results in silencing of innate immunity genes, including the type III interferon receptor IFNLR1, through depletion of H3K36 di-methylation (H3K36me2) and gain of H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3). Inhibition of EZH2 restores immune infiltration and impairs the growth of Nsd1-mutant tumors. Thus, our work uncovers a druggable chromatin cross talk that regulates the viral mimicry response and enables immune evasion of DNA hypomethylated tumors.",

        "Abstract": "In C-band intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) systems, the frequency-dependent power fading induced by chromatic dispersion (CD) and square-law detection limits the transmission capacity and distance, especially for beyond 100-Gb/s transmissions over a 100-km dispersion-uncompensated link. To reach this goal, we propose a scheme of nonlinear pre-distortion, novel, to the best of our knowledge, combined pulse shaping, and post nonlinear equalization for four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4)-based IM/DD systems. At the transmitter, the nonlinear pre-distortion is used to generate unequally spaced PAM-4 symbols for pre-compensating the nonlinearities. While the novel pulse shaping, simply shaped by the linear combination of two inter-symbol interference (ISI)-free pulses, alters the frequency-domain power distribution of the PAM-4 signal and results in performance improvement. At the receiver, low-complexity post nonlinear equalization using an absolute-term based nonlinear equalizer with weight sharing (AT-NLE-WS) is performed to eliminate CD-induced power fading and residual nonlinear impairments. With the cooperation of these techniques, record 120-Gb/s PAM-4 signals are successfully transmitted over a 100-km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) with the measured bit error ratio (BER) below 3.8 \u00d7 10",

        "Abstract": "Plant adaptation to challenging environmental conditions around the world has made root growth and development an important research area for plant breeders and scientists. Targeted manipulation of root system architecture (RSA) to increase water and nutrient use efficiency can minimize the adverse effects of climate change on crop production. However, phenotyping of RSA is a major bottleneck since the roots are hidden in the soil. Recently the development of 2- and 3D root imaging techniques combined with the genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have opened up new research tools to identify the genetic basis of RSA. These approaches provide a comprehensive understanding of the RSA, by accelerating the identification and characterization of genes involved in root growth and development. This review summarizes the latest developments in phenotyping techniques and GWAS for RSA, which are used to map important genes regulating various aspects of RSA under varying environmental conditions. Furthermore, we discussed about the state-of-the-art image analysis tools integrated with various phenotyping platforms for investigating and quantifying root traits with the highest phenotypic plasticity in both artificial and natural environments which were used for large scale association mapping studies, leading to the identification of RSA phenotypes and their underlying genetics with the greatest potential for RSA improvement. In addition, challenges in root phenotyping and GWAS are also highlighted, along with future research directions employing machine learning and pan-genomics approaches.",

        "Abstract": "Cigarette smoking (CS) leads to several adverse health effects, including diseases, disabilities, and even death. Post-operative and trauma patients who smoke have an increased risk for complications, such as delayed bone or wound healing. In clinical trials, microcurrent (MC) has been shown to be a safe, non-invasive, and effective way to accelerate wound healing. Our study aimed to investigate if MC with the strength of 100 \u03bcA may be beneficial in treating CS-related healing impairment, especially in regard to angiogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effect of human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT) on angiogenesis after 72 h of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) exposure in the presence or absence of 100 \u03bcA MC. Cell viability and proliferation were evaluated by resazurin conversion, Sulforhodamine B, and Calcein-AM/Hoechst 33342 staining; the pro-angiogenic potential of HaCaT cells was evaluated by tube formation assay and angiogenesis array assay; signaling pathway alterations were investigated using Western blot. Constant exposure for 72 h to a 100 \u03bcA MC enhanced the angiogenic ability of HaCaT cells, which was mediated through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In conclusion, the current data indicate that 100 \u03bcA MC may support wound healing in smoking patients by enhancing angiogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Endometriosis (EM) is one of the vanquished wonted causes of chronic pelvic sting in women and is closely associated with infertility. The long-term, complex, systemic, and post-treatment recurrence of EM wreaks havoc on women's quality of life. Extensive metabolic reprogramming (aerobic glycolysis, glucose overweening intake, and high lactate production) and cancer-like changes have been found in EM, which bears striking similarities to tumorigenesis. The key glycolysis regulator PFKFB4 is overexpressed in EM. However, the mechanism of PFKFB4 in EM remains unknown. We found that PFKFB4 was upregulated and was closely related to the progression of EM. We identified focus PIM2 as a new pioneering adjoin protein of PFKFB4. Vigorous biochemical methods were used to confirm that PIM2 phosphorylated site Thr140 of PFKFB4. PIM2 also could enhance PFKFB4 protein expression through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Moreover, PIM2 expression was really corresponding prevalent with PFKFB4 in endometriosis in vivo. Importantly, phosphorylation of PFKFB4 on Thr140 by PIM2 promoted EM glycolysis and cell growth. Our study demonstrates that PIM2 mediates PFKFB4 Thr140 phosphorylation thus regulating glycolysis and EM progression. We illustrated a new mechanism that PIM2 simulated a central upstream partnership in the regulation of PFKFB4, and reveal a novel means of PIM2-PFKFB4 setting EM growth. Our research provided new theoretical support for further clarifying the reprogramming of EM glucose metabolism, and provided new clues for exploring non-contraceptive treatments for EM.",

        "Abstract": "We propose a simple two-step amplifier configuration algorithm based on signal power across different channels to improve the generalized signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR) performance of dynamic C\u2009+\u2009L-band links in the presence of amplifier spontaneous emission (ASE) noise, Kerr nonlinearity, and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) using erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA). In step 1, ASE noise and Kerr nonlinearity are taken into account to derive sub-optimal signal power profiles at the beginning of each span using the local optimization global optimization (LOGO) strategy. The effect of SRS is compensated through amplifier gain pre-tilt in step 2. Simulations for links with homogeneous/heterogeneous spans, static full-channel loading, and dynamic loading due to gradual channel additions for C\u2009+\u2009L-band upgrades show that the proposed algorithm can achieve similar GSNR performance, but requires much less execution time, compared to other iterative methods that target for improving the GSNR across the C\u2009+\u2009L band, thus making it a fast and efficient GSNR management strategy for future dynamic C\u2009+\u2009L-band networks.",

        "Abstract": "This paper aims to apply the time-varying Granger causality test (TVGC) and the DY Spillover Index (Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012) to measure the Granger causality and dynamic risk spillover effects of the international crude oil futures market on China's agricultural commodity futures market from the perspectives of return and volatility spillovers. Empirical evidence relating to the TVGC test suggests the existence of unidirectional Granger causality between crude oil futures and agricultural product futures. This relationship shows a strong time-varying property, in particular for sudden or extreme events such as financial crises and natural disasters. On the other hand, the volatility spillover in crude oil and agricultural product futures markets responds asymmetrically and bidirectionally according to the result of the DY Spillover index, and the periodicity of total volatility spillover correlates closely with the occurrence of global economic events, which indicates that the spillover effect between crude oil and agricultural commodity futures markets will be exacerbated in turbulent financial and economic times. Such findings are expected to help in formulating policy recommendations, portfolio design, and risk-management decisions.",

        "Abstract": "Small modular reactors (SMR) have an exceptionally wide range of applications due to their flexibility. But the reactivity of SMR is more susceptible to disturbance than that of large commercial reactors, which may cause the core power to deviate from the set value, and the limited internal space makes it difficult for SMR to compensate or adjust for reactivity disturbance by setting a sufficient number of control rods as in large commercial reactors. Therefore, in order to improve the operational stability of SMR, a method is proposed to indirectly change the nuclear fuel temperature by adjusting the coolant flow rate and thus compensate the reactivity disturbance by the Doppler effect of nuclear fuel resonance absorption. Simulation experiments show that the method can effectively eliminate reactive disturbances that cannot be completely eliminated by control rods under the conditions of restricted SMR space and limited number of control rod sets, thus providing operational stability of SMR.",

Through mapping adjacent symbols of PAM-4 signals onto the complex domain, the influence of strongest inter-symbol interference (ISI) can be alleviated during the decision process in a decision feedback equalizer (DFE), effectively combating burst-error propagation when signals are noisy. Moreover, signal-adaptive manipulations of DFE parameters in both the time and the amplitude domain are performed by using an ultra-stable timing recovery and level-adaptive decision. Performance evaluations are made on vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) modulated and multimode fiber (MMF) transmitted 100-Gbit/s optical PAM-4 signals. Based on experimental results of the short-reach optical communication, the proposed DFE outperforms the traditional DFE with a 0.5-dB system power budget gain at the 7% overhead (OH) forward error correction (FEC) bit error rate (BER) threshold.",

The elucidation of ferroptosis pathways may lead to novel cancer therapies. Current evidence suggests that the mechanism of ferroptosis can be summarized as oxidative stress and antioxidant defense mechanisms. During this process, ferrous ions play a crucial role in cellular oxidation, plasma membrane damage, reactive oxygen species removal imbalance and lipid peroxidation.

        "Abstract": "Upconversion (UC) nanostructures, which can upconvert near-infrared (NIR) light with low energy to visible or UV light with higher energy, are investigated for theranostic applications. The surface of lanthanide (Ln)-doped UC nanostructures can be modified with different functional groups and bioconjugated with biomolecules for therapeutic systems. On the other hand, organic molecular-based UC nanostructures, by using the triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) UC mechanism, have high UC quantum yields and do not require high excitation power. In this review, the major UC mechanisms in different nanostructures have been introduced, including the Ln-doped UC mechanism and the TTA UC mechanism. The design and fabrication of Ln-doped UC nanostructures and TTA UC-based UC nanostructures for theranostic applications have been reviewed and discussed. In addition, the current progress in the application of UC nanostructures for diagnosis and therapy has been summarized, including tumor-targeted bioimaging and chemotherapy, image-guided diagnosis and phototherapy, NIR-triggered controlled drug releasing and bioimaging. We also provide insight into the development of emerging UC nanostructures in the field of theranostics.",

        "Abstract": "Nitrogen-polar (N-polar) III-nitride materials have great potential for application in long-wavelength light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the poor quality of N-polar nitride materials hinders the development of N-polar devices. In this work, we report the enhanced performance of N-polar GaN-based LEDs with an optimized InGaN/GaN double quantum well (DQW) structure grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. We improved the quality of the N-polar InGaN/GaN DQWs by elevating the growth temperature and introducing hydrogen as the carrier gas during the growth of the quantum barrier layers. N-polar LEDs prepared based on the optimized InGaN/GaN DQWs show significantly enhanced (by over 90%) external quantum efficiency and a weakened droop effect compared with a reference LED. More importantly, the optimized N-polar DQWs show a significantly longer emission wavelength than Ga-polar DQWs grown at the same QW growth temperature. This work provides a feasible approach to improving the quality of the N-polar InGaN/GaN QW structure, and it will promote the development of N-polar GaN-based long-wavelength light-emitting devices for micro-LED displays.",

In this study, gold nanocluster-encapsulated hyperbranched polyethyleneimine (hPEI-Au NCs) has been explored as the specific and ratiometric DA nanoprobe through hPEI-assisted DA self-polymerization reactions. The Au NCs encapsulation not only provides a fluorescent internal reference but also enhances the DA self-polymerization by weakening the proton sponge effect of the hPEI layer. Rapid and sensitive DA detection is realized through the proposed hPEI-Au NC nanoprobe with a limit of detection of 10\u00a0nM. The favorable selectivity over other possible interferents including amino acids, sugars, and salts is due to the specific self-polymerization reaction. The DA analysis in urine samples with small relative standard deviations has been accomplished with an hPEI-Au NC nanoprobe.",

        "Abstract": "Laparoscopic duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection (L-DPPHR) is technically demanding with extreme difficulty in biliary preservation. Only a few reports of L-DPPHR are available with alarming bile leakage, and none of them revealed the long-term metabolic outcomes. For the first time, our study explored the different dosage and timing of indocyanine green (ICG) for guiding L-DPPHR and described the long-term metabolic results.",

        "Abstract": "A total of 8 bHLH transcription factors were cloned from Panax quinquefolius and the response of them to methyl jasmonate(MeJA) was studied.To be specific, based on the preliminary transcriptome screening, 8 bHLH transcription factors were cloned with seedlings which had been cultured for 3 weeks.The content of ginsenosides Rg_1, Re, and Rb_1, and total saponins in the adventitious roots of P.quinquefolius was determined at different time of MeJA treatment by high performance liquid chromatography(HPLC) and spectrophotometry.Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction(PCR) was used to detect the relative expression of 8 transcription factors after MeJA treatment.The correlation between the relative expression of the 8 transcription factors and the saponin content after MeJA treatment was checked by Pearson's correlation analysis.The results showed that the PCR products(Pq-bHLH21-Pq-bHLH28) of the 8 bHLH transcription factors were 762-2 013 bp in length.They were submitted to NCBI to obtain the Genbank access numbers.The proteins yielded from Pq-bHLH21-Pq-bHLH28 showed amino acid sequence identity of 24.90%, and each amino acid sequence had the bHLH(Basic Helix-loop-helix) conserved domain and belonged to the bHLH family.The 5 amino acid sequences of Pq-bHLH22 and Pq-bHLH24-Pq-bHLH27 contained the bHLH-MYC N domain, which belonged to the MYC transcription factors.Pq-bHLH21-Pq-bHLH28 responded to MeJA within 48 h of treatment.At 72 h, the expression of Pq-bHLH24 reached 106.53 folds the highest in the treatment group.Pq-bHLH25, Pq-bHLH27, and Pq-bHLH28 showed synergic expression.Pq-bHLH21 may re-gulate the biosynthetic pathway of ginsenoside Rb_1, while Pq-bHLH22, Pq-bHLH25, and Pq-bHLH28 were in significantly positive correlation with the biosynthetic pathway of ginsenoside Re.The result lays a foundation for further verifying the regulation of ginsenoside biosynthesis by bHLH transcription factors.",

        "Abstract": "Melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) frequently occurs in patients with advanced melanoma; yet, our understanding of the underlying salient biology is rudimentary. Here, we performed single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq in 22 treatment-naive MBMs and 10 extracranial melanoma metastases (ECMs) and matched spatial single-cell transcriptomics and T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR)-seq. Cancer cells from MBM were more chromosomally unstable, adopted a neuronal-like cell state, and enriched for spatially variably expressed metabolic pathways. Key observations were validated in independent patient cohorts, patient-derived MBM/ECM xenograft models, RNA/ATAC-seq, proteomics, and multiplexed imaging. Integrated spatial analyses revealed distinct geography of putative cancer immune evasion and evidence for more abundant intra-tumoral B to plasma cell differentiation in lymphoid aggregates in MBM. MBM harbored larger fractions of monocyte-derived macrophages and dysfunctional TOX",

        "Abstract": "A nonlinearity-aware signal transmission scheme based on a low-complexity 3rd-order diagonally pruned absolute-term nonlinear equalizer (NLE) with weight sharing (DP-AT-NLE-WS) and rate-adaptable probabilistically shaped 16-level pulse amplitude modulation (PS-PAM-16) signal is proposed and experimentally demonstrated for C-band net-300-Gbit/s/\u03bb short-reach optical interconnects. By replacing the multiplication operation with the absolute operation and applying weight sharing to reduce the kernel redundancy, the computational complexity of the proposed 3rd-order DP-AT-NLE-WS is reduced by >40% compared with the 3rd-order DP-Volterra NLE (DP-VNLE), DP-AT-NLE, and DP-VNLE-WS, with the achieved normalized general mutual information (NGMI) above a threshold of 0.857. Employing a commercial 32-GHz Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and a single digital-to-analog converter (DAC), we demonstrate the single-lane transmission of 100-GBaud PS-PAM-16 signal using DP-AT-NLE-WS in the C band at record 370-Gbit/s line rate and 300.4-Gbit/s net rate over 1-km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF), achieving 21.2% (15.5%) capacity improvement over 100 (105)-GBaud PAM-8 transmission. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first net-300-Gbit/s intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) short-reach transmission in the C band using commercially available components.",

        "Abstract": "The process of wound healing involves a complex and vast interplay of growth factors and cytokines that coordinate the recruitment and interaction of various cell types. A series of events involving inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling eventually leads to the restoration of the damaged tissue. Abrogation in the regulation of these events has been shown to result in excessive scarring or non-healing wounds. While the process of wound healing is not fully elucidated, it has been documented that the early events of wound healing play a key role in the outcome of the wound. Furthermore, high levels of inflammation have been shown to lead to scarring. The regulation of these events may result in scarless wound healing, especially in adults. The inhibition of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and the administration of keratinocyte growth factors (KGF), KGF-1 and KGF-2, has in recent years yielded positive results in the acceleration of wound closure and reduced scarring. Here, we encapsulate recent knowledge on the roles of TGF-\u03b2, KGF1, and KGF2 in wound healing and scar formation and highlight the areas that need further investigation. We also discuss potential future directions for the use of growth factors in wound management.",

        "Abstract": "Focal bacterial infections are often difficult to treat due to the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, high risk of relapse, and severe inflammation at local lesions. To address multidrug-resistant skin and soft tissue infections, a bacteria-absorbing sponge was prepared to involve a \"trap-and-kill\" mechanism. The system describes a guanidinium-rich lipopeptide functionalized lyotropic liquid-crystalline hydrogel with bicontinuous cubic networks. Amphiphilic lipopeptides can be spontaneously anchored to the lipid-water interface, exposing their bacterial targeting sequences to enhance antibacterial trapping/killing activity. Computational simulations supported our structural predictions, and the sponge was confirmed to successfully remove \u223c98.8% of the bacteria in the medium. Release and degradation behavior studies indicated that the bacteria-absorbing sponge could degrade, mediate enzyme-responsive lipopeptide release, or generate \u223c200 nm lipopeptide nanoparticles with environmental erosion. This implies that the sponge can effectively capture and isolate high concentrations of bacteria at the infected site and then sustainably release antimicrobial lipopeptides into deep tissues for the eradication of residual bacteria. In the animal experiment, we found that the antibacterial performance of the bacterial-absorbing sponge was significant, which demonstrated not only a long-term inhibition effect to disinfect and avoid bacterial rebound, but also a unique advantage to protect tissue from bacterial attack. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Host defense peptides/peptidomimetics (HDPs) have shown potential for the elimination of focal bacterial infections, but the application of their topical formulations suffers from time-consuming preparation processes, indistinctive toxicity reduction effects, and inefficient bacterial capture ability. To explore new avenues for the development of easily prepared, low-toxicity and high-efficiency topical antimicrobials, a guanidinium-rich lipopeptide was encapsulated in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline hydrogel (denoted as \"bacteria-absorbing sponge\") to achieve complementary superiorities. The superior characteristic of the bacteria-absorbing sponge involves a \"trap-and-kill\" mechanism, which undergoes not only a long-term inhibition effect to disinfect and avoid bacterial rebound, but also effective bacterial capture and isolating action to confine bacterial diffusion and protect tissues from bacterial attack.",

        "Abstract": "A very-high-bandwidth integrated silicon microring modulator (MRM) designed on a commercial silicon photonics (SiP) platform for C-band operation is presented. The MRM has a 3 dB electro-optic (EO) bandwidth of over 67\u2005GHz and features a small footprint of 24\u2005\u00b5m \u00d7\u200970\u2005\u00b5m. Using the MRM, we demonstrate intensity modulation-direct detection (IM-DD) transmission with 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) \u00a0signaling of over 100 Gbaud. By utilizing the optical peaking effect and negative chirp in the MRM, we extend the transmission distance, which is limited by the fiber-dispersion-induced frequency fading. Using a standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) for transmission across distances of up to 2\u2005km, we measured the data transmission of 100 Gbaud PAM-4 signals with a bit error rate (BER) under the general 7% hard-decision forward-error correction (HD-FEC) threshold. The MRM enables an extended transmission distance for 100 Gbaud signaling in the C-band without dispersion compensation.",

        "Abstract": "Ischemic heart diseases and ischemic stroke are closely related to circadian clock and unstable atherosclerotic plaques. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) can stabilize or destabilize an atherosclerotic lesion through phenotypic switch. BMAL1 is not only an indispensable core component in circadian clock but also an important regulator in atherosclerosis and VSMCs proliferation. However, little is known about the modulation mechanisms of BMAL1 in VSMCs phenotypic switch and atherosclerotic plaque stability.",

        "Abstract": "Idiopathic achalasia is a primary esophageal motility disorder characterized by the absence of esophageal peristalsis and impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). However, the pathogenesis of idiopathic achalasia remains unclear. To further understand the pathogenesis, we conducted lncRNA and mRNA microarray analyses. LES specimens from 5 patients and 4 controls were used for microarray. Potential target genes with significantly changed lncRNA and mRNA were predicted using cis/trans-regulatory algorithms, followed by the Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis to understand the biophysical effect. Finally, 7,133 significantly dysregulated mRNAs (3,136 increased and 3,997 decreased), along with 6,892 significantly dysregulated lncRNAs (4,900 increased and 1,992 decreased). Biophysical function analysis revealed that the cell adhesion molecule (CAM) pathway was a common pathway. The predicted lncRNA targets of NRXN1 (Down FC: 9.07), NTNG2 (UP FC: 2.75), CADM1 (Down FC: 2.26), NLGN1 (Down FC: 4.60), NEGR1 (Down FC: 2.335), CD22 (Down FC: 5.62), HLA-DQB1 (Down FC: 5.06), and HLA-DOA (Down FC: 2.31) were inputted in this pathway, which was mainly located in the synapse part of the neural system and immune system. Our study demonstrates the lncRNAs and corresponding mRNAs that may play important roles in idiopathic achalasia.",

        "Title": "Maize leaf disease identification based on WG-MARNet.",
        "Abstract": "In deep learning-based maize leaf disease detection, a maize disease identification method called Network based on wavelet threshold-guided bilateral filtering, multi-channel ResNet, and attenuation factor (WG-MARNet) is proposed. This method can solve the problems of noise, background interference, and low detection accuracy of maize leaf disease images. To begin, a processing layer called Wavelet threshold guided bilateral filtering (WT-GBF) based on the WG-MARNet model is employed to reduce image noise and perform high and low-frequency decomposition of the input image using WT-GBF. This increases the input image's resistance to environmental interference and feature extraction capability. Secondly, for the multiscale feature fusion technique, an average down-sampling and tiling method is employed to increase feature representation and limit the risk of overfitting. Then, on high and low-frequency multi-channel, an attenuation factor is introduced to optimize the performance instability during training of the deep network. Finally, when the convergence and accuracy are compared, PRelu and Adabound are used instead of the Relu activation function and the Adam optimizer. The experimental results revealed that our method's average recognition accuracy was 97.96%, and the detection time for a single image was 0.278 seconds. The average detection accuracy has been increased. The method lays the groundwork for the precise control of maize diseases in the field.",

        "Abstract": "The valve replacement is the main treatment of heart valve disease. However, thrombus formation following valve replacement has always been a major clinical drawback. Accelerating the endothelialization of cardiac valve prosthesis is the main approach to reduce thrombus. In the current study, a titanium nanotube was biofunctionalized with a chitosan/genipin heparin hydrogel and the controlled release of interleukin-4 (IL-4), and its regulation of macrophages was investigated to see if it could influence endothelial cells to eventually accelerate endothelialization. TNT60 (titanium dioxide nanotubes, 60 V) with nanoarray was obtained by anodic oxidation of 60 V, and IL-4 was loaded into the nanotube by vacuum drying. The hydrogel (chitosan\u2009:\u2009genipin = 4\u2009:\u20091) was applied to the surface of the nanotubes following drying, and the heparin drops were placed on the hydrogel surface with chitosan as the polycation and heparin as the polyanion. A TNT/IL-4/G (G = gel, chitosan/genipin heparin) delivery system was prepared. Our results demonstrated that the biofunctionalization of titanium nanotube with chitosan/genipin heparin hydrogel and the controlled release of IL-4 had a significant regulatory effect on macrophage M2 polarization, reducing the inflammatory factor release and higher secretion of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), which can accelerate the endothelialization of the implant.",

        "Abstract": "The bandwidth limitation of optoelectronic devices is a key constraint for realizing higher capacity short-reach optical communication systems. In this work, we show that the performance of the timing recovery algorithm will significantly impact the performance of bandwidth-limited optical PAM-4 signals. To address this problem, we introduce a moving average filter (MAF) into the Gardner retiming loop to realize ultra-stable retiming without any pilot symbols. It enables a significantly reduced timing jitter, especially for bandwidth-limited conditions. Based on simulations, we show that the proposed retiming scheme will give a stable sampling phase, which is beneficial to the performance of the decision feedback equalizer. Compared to the system based on the traditional Gardner timing synchronization algorithm, the 2-dB power budget gain is realized. The proposed method improves the equalization performance of short-reach optical communication systems where complexity and processing latency are important concerns.",

        "Abstract": "Epigenetic modifications on the chromatin do not occur in isolation. Chromatin-associated proteins and their modification products form a highly interconnected network, and disturbing one component may rearrange the entire system. We see this increasingly clearly in epigenetically dysregulated cancers. It is important to understand the rules governing epigenetic interactions. Here, we use the mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) model to describe in detail the relationships within the H3K27-H3K36-DNA methylation subnetwork. In particular, we focus on the major epigenetic reorganization caused by deletion of the histone 3 lysine 36 methyltransferase NSD1, which in mESCs deposits nearly all of the intergenic H3K36me2. Although disturbing the H3K27 and DNA methylation (DNAme) components also affects this network to a certain extent, the removal of H3K36me2 has the most drastic effect on the epigenetic landscape, resulting in full intergenic spread of H3K27me3 and a substantial decrease in DNAme. By profiling DNMT3A and CHH methylation (mCHH), we show that H3K36me2 loss upon ",

        "Abstract": "Bladder cancer (BCa) is the most common cancer in the urinary system with high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a novel subclass of noncoding-RNA which participate in progression of BCa. Here, we identified a novel circRNA-circ3323 and aimed to investigate the role of circ3323 in progression of BCa. Public data of RNA sequencing was used to identify significant circRNA related to BCa. The role of circRNAs in progression of BCa was assessed in cytotoxicity assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry. Biotin-coupled RNA pull-down and fluorescence in situ hybridization were performed to evaluate the interaction between circRNAs and miRNAs. The expression of circ3323 was higher in BCa tissues and cells than in normal samples. Experiments in vitro showed that the knockdown of circ3323 inhibited cell proliferation and impeded the metastasis of BCa cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that circ3323 acts as a sponge for miR-186-5p and promotes host gene APP's expression. Clinically, circ3323 predicts worse overall survival of BCa patients, indicating its prognostic value. Our study identified that circ3323 modulates metastasis of BCa through miR-186-5p/APP axis and may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker for BCa, which provides novel insights into treatment of BCa.",

        "Abstract": "The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) had a large impact on human health and socio-economics worldwide. The lockdown implemented in China beginning from January 23, 2020 led to sharp reductions in human activities and associated emissions. The declines in primary pollution provided a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between anthropogenic emissions and air quality. This study reports on air pollutant and meteorological measurements at different heights from a tall tower in the Pearl River Delta. These measurements were used to investigate the vertical scale response of pollutants to understand reductions in human activities. Compared to that in the pre-lockdown period (from December 16, 2019), the concentrations of surface layer nitric oxide (NO",

In this study, a catechin-functionalized gold nanocluster (C-Au NC) nanoprobe has been explored for the ratiometric DA sensing. The detection mechanism is based on the formation of azamonardine via selective DA-catechin chemical reaction and subsequent enhanced fluorescence emission. Using Au NC emission as the internal reference, ratiometric fluorescence variation is realized, which allows sensitive DA analysis with a limit of detection of 1.0\u00a0nM (S/N\u00a0=\u00a03) and linear response concentration range from 0 to 500\u00a0nM. The characteristic chemical reaction between catechin and DA affords favorable selectivity over other amino acids, metal ions and small molecules. In addition, the practical application of the proposed nanoprobe is validated by the accurate detection of DA content in urea and cell lysate samples.",

        "Title": "Improving laser-EMAT ultrasonic energy conversion efficiency using surface constraint mechanism.",
        "Abstract": "To address the problem of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of ultrasonic echo generated by laser-electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) ultrasonic method in metal materials, a method to improve the energy conversion efficiency of laser-EMAT ultrasonic testing using the surface constraint mechanism is proposed. Based on numerical simulation and experiment, the excitation mechanism of a laser surface heat source with and without a surface constraint mechanism is investigated, and the effect of the water film surface constraint on the laser-EMAT ultrasonic testing echo of different metal materials is analyzed. The effects of laser spot radius, laser power density, laser pulse duration, EMAT design parameters, and water film parameters on the ultrasonic echo amplitude and multimode ultrasonic energy distribution ratio are also investigated, and the optimal combination of laser excitation and EMAT reception parameters is provided. The results show that the laser power density and spot radius significantly affect the multimode ultrasonic amplitudes. Under the water film surface constraint, the energy distributions of shear waves (SWs) and longitudinal waves (LWs) change significantly, and the energy of the SW change rules of different metal materials are different. After using the surface constraint mechanism, the LW amplitude improves significantly, and the SNR of the LW is increased by at least 13.0\u00a0dB, the main bang duration is reduced by at least 29.4%, and the main bang amplitude is reduced by more than 80.5%. The relevant information of the surface constraint mechanism provides an effective reference for designing the laser-EMAT testing system with LW detections and reducing the dead zone in ultrasonic testing.",

        "Abstract": "MYC as a transcriptional factor plays a crucial role in breast cancer progression. However, the mechanisms underlying MYC deubiquitination in breast cancer are not well defined. Here, we report that OTUB1 is responsible for MYC deubiquitination. OTUB1 could directly deubiquitinate MYC at K323 site, which blocks MYC protein degradation. Moreover, OTUB1 mediated MYC protein stability is also confirmed in OTUB1-knockout mice. Stabilized MYC by OTUB1 promotes its transcriptional activity and induces HK2 expression, which leads to enhance aerobic glycolysis. Therefore, OTUB1 promotes breast tumorigenesis in vivo and in vitro via blocking MYC protein degradation. Taken together, our data identify OTUB1 as a new deubiquitination enzyme for MYC protein degradation, which provides a potential target for breast cancer treatment.",

        "Abstract": "It has been proposed for years that physical exercise ameliorates metabolic diseases. Optimal exercise timing in humans and mammals has indicated that circadian clocks play a vital role in exercise and body metabolism. Skeletal muscle metabolism exhibits a robust circadian rhythm under the control of the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. Clock genes also control the development, differentiation, and function of skeletal muscles. In this review, we aimed to clarify the relationship between exercise, skeletal muscles, and the circadian clock. Health benefits can be attained by the scheduling of exercise at the best circadian time. Exercise therapy for metabolic diseases and cardiovascular health is a key adjuvant method. This review highlights the importance of exercise timing in maintaining healthy metabolism and circadian clocks.",

        "Abstract": "We propose the asynchronous control of anisotropic diffusion (AD) algorithm, and such asynchronous anisotropic diffusion (AAD) algorithm is demonstrated experimentally to reduce noise from the sensing signals obtained from Brillouin distributed optical fiber sensors. The performance of the proposed AAD algorithm is analyzed in detail for different experimental conditions and compared with that of block-matching and 3D filtering, two-dimensional wavelet denoising, AD, and non-local means algorithms. Some key factors of the proposed algorithm, such as the impact of convolution kernel size on the performance of AD algorithms, the influence of low sampling point number (SPN) on the quality of Brillouin frequency shift and the selection of diffusion thresholds are analyzed and discussed with experimental results. The experimental results validate that the AAD algorithm can provide better root-mean-square error (RMSE) and spatial resolution (SR) than the other four algorithms, especially for higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement and higher SPNs. For lower SPNs, the performance of AAD is also not inferior to the RMSE performance of NLM and AD. The runtime of the AAD algorithm is also quite low. Moreover, the proposed algorithm offers the best SR performance as compared to other noise reduction algorithms investigated in this study. Thus, the proposed AAD algorithm can be an effective candidate to improve the measurement accuracy of Brillouin distributed optical fiber sensors.",

        "Abstract": "Temperature distribution in concrete is significant to the concrete structure's macro properties and different factors affect the heat transfer in concrete, and therefore influence the temperature distribution. This work established a three-dimensional transient heat transfer model coupled with various environmental factors, using the finite element method for calculating the results and real-measured data for testing accuracy. In addition, a sensitivity evaluation of various factors was conducted. Due to various environmental factors, the results revealed that the prediction of temperature distribution in concrete by the three-dimensional model had great accuracy with an error of less than 4%. A particular hysteresis effect of temperature response in the concrete existed. Considering heat transfer in different spatial directions, the model can predict the temperature change of each spatial point instead of the spatial surface in different depths, proving the shortcomings of a one-dimensional heat transfer model. A greater solar radiation intensity caused a more significant temperature difference on the concrete surface: the surface temperature difference in July was twice as significant as that in December. Wind speed had a cooling effect on the concrete surface, and stronger wind speed accompanied with a stronger cooling effect made the surface temperature closer to the ambient temperature. Material properties had different effects on the temperature distribution of the surface part and internal part: the specific heat capacity determined the speed of the outer layer temperature change while the thermal conductivity determined the speed of the inner layer temperature change.",

        "Abstract": "To increase the transmission capacity, ultra-wideband wavelength-division multiplexing (UWB WDM) has been exploited to enlarge the spectral range. However, inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) results in power transition from high-frequency channels to low-frequency channels in wideband scenarios, which degrades the Q-factor of signals. Hence, we modify the optimization method of power control by applying the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to search for the optimal power slopes and offsets of three bands to construct an optimum distribution of launch powers over channels. High transmission capacity can be reached by carrying 384 channels (96+96+192) in the C+L+S band with the consideration of dynamic Raman gain and channel-dependent parameters. We show that compared to using brute-force searching (BFS), a comparable and even higher transmission capacity can be achieved by the SA algorithm. Meanwhile, the searching speed of the SA algorithm is much faster. Also, different optimizing strategies can be selected to balance the trade-off between capacity and spectral flatness. This method can be used for designing arbitrary optical fiber UWB WDM systems before practical testing.",

It is found that decreasing the refractive index of the center and trench of each ring core can increase the available ring-core thickness and meanwhile suppress the radial higher-order modes. Based on the simulation, a fiber, with a thicker ring core and a relatively low refractive index contrast at the ring-core boundaries, is found of higher mode purity and lower macro-bending-caused mode coupling. In the experiment, the seven cores of the fabricated fiber have low transmission losses around -0.25 dB/km with only a few fluctuations. The three higher-order mode groups (MG",

        "Abstract": "Semiconductor superlattice true random number generator (SSL-TRNG) has an outstanding practical property on high-throughput and high-security cryptographic applications. Security in random number generators is closely related to the min-entropy of the raw output because feeding cryptographic applications with insufficient entropy leads to poor security and vulnerability to malicious attacks. However, no research has focused on the min-entropy estimation based on the stochastic\u00a0model for SSL-TRNG, which is a highly recommended method for evaluating the security of a specific TRNG structure. A min-entropy estimation method is proposed in this paper for the SSL-TRNG by extending the Markov stochastic model derived from the memory effects. By calculating the boundary of the transition matrix, the min-entropy result is the average value of each sample (1 bit) is 0.2487. Moreover, the experimental results show that the estimator is accurate enough to adjust compression rate dynamically in post-processing to reach the required security level, estimating entropy on the fly rather than off-line.",

        "Abstract": "The epigenetic landscape of a cell frequently changes in response to fluctuations in nutrient levels, but the mechanistic link is not well understood. In fission yeast, the JmjC domain protein Epe1 is critical for maintaining the heterochromatin landscape. While loss of Epe1 results in heterochromatin expansion, overexpression of Epe1 leads to defective heterochromatin. Through a genetic screen, we found that mutations in genes of the cAMP signaling pathway suppress the heterochromatin defects associated with Epe1 overexpression. We further demonstrated that the activation of Pka1, the downstream effector of cAMP signaling, is required for the efficient translation of epe1+ mRNA to maintain Epe1 overexpression. Moreover, inactivation of the cAMP-signaling pathway, either through genetic mutations or glucose deprivation, leads to the reduction of endogenous Epe1 and corresponding heterochromatin changes. These results reveal the mechanism by which the cAMP signaling pathway regulates heterochromatin landscape in fission yeast.",

Reports have shown that severe anaphylactoid reactions can occur after intravenous injections, whereas the underlying mechanisms remain undefined. In this study, the effects of Gd-DTPA in causing allergic like reactions and mast cells (MCs) activation were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Gd-DTPA induced a severe hand paw swelling and body temperature decrease in murine topical cutaneous allergy model, and murine systemic allergy model. Meanwhile, serum IgE was not significantly changed. Histamine, tryptase, and cytokines release in mice serum and LAD2 cells supernatant were increased significantly both in mice serum and LAD2 supernatant after treated with Gd-DTPA. Subsequently, the changes in mRNA levels after Gd-DTPA activated MCs were analyzed by RNAseq and found to be related to inflammation signaling pathways. The study provides a demonstration for the adverse reaction mechanism of Gd-DTPA and its safe use in clinic.",

        "Abstract": "Black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets emerged as promising 2D nanomaterial that have been applied to eradicate antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, their applications are limited by intrinsic ambient instability. Here, the \u03b5-poly-l-lysine (\u03b5-PL)-engineered BP nanosheets are constructed via simple electrostatic interaction to cater the demand for passivating BP with amplified antibacterial activity. The dual drug-delivery complex named BP@\u03b5-PL can closely anchor onto the surface of bacteria, leading to membrane disintegration. Subsequently, in situ hyperthermia generated by BP under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation can precisely eradicate pathogenic bacteria. In vitro antibacterial studies verify the rapid disinfection ability of BP@\u03b5-PL against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) within 15\u00a0min. Moreover, \u03b5-PL can serve as an effective protector to avoid chemical degradation of bare BP. The in vivo antibacterial study shows that a 99.4% antibacterial rate in a MRSA skin infection model is achieved, which is accompanied by negligible toxicity. In conclusion, this work not merely provides a new conjecture for protecting the BP, but also opens a novel window for synergistic antibiotic-resistant bacteria therapy based on antimicrobial peptides and 2D photothermal nanomaterial.",

        "Abstract": "Generally, the high efficiency of solution-processable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) comes at the expense of using expensive organic matters as a hole-transport material (HTM). Although intense efforts have tried to use commercially available and low-cost macrocyclic molecules as HTM candidates, they still face two enormous challenges: poor solubility and inherent instability. Here, solvothermal treatment for old and insoluble HTMs (phthalocyanine (Pc) and its derivatives) has been proposed, which is unusual due to the occurrence of solubilization for insoluble precursors induced by the carbonization of the dissolved part. Since the macrocyclic structure still exists, the as-prepared new-type carbon dots not only retain the capacity of hole transfer but serve as an effective passivation additive.

        "Title": "CHAF1A/B mediate silencing of unintegrated HIV-1 DNAs early in infection.",
        "Abstract": "Early events of the retroviral life cycle are the targets of many host restriction factors that have evolved to prevent establishment of infection. Incoming retroviral DNAs are transcriptionally silenced before integration in most cell types, and efficient viral gene expression occurs only after formation of the provirus. The molecular machinery for silencing unintegrated retroviral DNAs of HIV-1 remains poorly characterized. Here, we identified the histone chaperones CHAF1A and CHAF1B as essential factors for silencing of unintegrated HIV-1 DNAs. Using RNAi-mediated knockdown (KD) of multiple histone chaperones, we found that KD of CHAF1A or CHAF1B resulted in a pronounced increase in expression of incoming viral DNAs. The function of these two proteins in silencing was independent of their interaction partner RBBP4. Viral DNA levels accumulated to significantly higher levels in CHAF1A KD cells over controls, suggesting enhanced stabilization of actively transcribed DNAs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed no major changes in histone loading onto viral DNAs in the absence of CHAF1A, but levels of the H3K9 trimethylation silencing mark were reduced. KD of the H3K9me3-binding protein HP1\u03b3 accelerated the expression of unintegrated HIV-1 DNAs. While CHAF1A was critical for silencing HIV-1 DNAs, it showed no role in silencing of unintegrated retroviral DNAs of mouse leukemia virus. Our study identifies CHAF1A and CHAF1B as factors involved specifically in silencing of HIV-1 DNAs early in infection. The results suggest that these factors act by noncanonical pathways, distinct from their histone loading activities, to mediate silencing of newly synthesized HIV-1 DNAs.",

        "Abstract": "Since sparse neural networks usually contain many zero weights, these unnecessary network connections can potentially be eliminated without degrading network performance. Therefore, well-designed sparse neural networks have the potential to significantly reduce the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) and computational resources. In this work, we propose a new automatic pruning method-sparse connectivity learning (SCL). Specifically, a weight is reparameterized as an elementwise multiplication of a trainable weight variable and a binary mask. Thus, network connectivity is fully described by the binary mask, which is modulated by a unit step function. We theoretically prove the fundamental principle of using a straight-through estimator (STE) for network pruning. This principle is that the proxy gradients of STE should be positive, ensuring that mask variables converge at their minima. After finding Leaky ReLU, Softplus, and identity STEs can satisfy this principle, we propose to adopt identity STE in SCL for discrete mask relaxation. We find that mask gradients of different features are very unbalanced; hence, we propose to normalize mask gradients of each feature to optimize mask variable training. In order to automatically train sparse masks, we include the total number of network connections as a regularization term in our objective function. As SCL does not require pruning criteria or hyperparameters defined by designers for network layers, the network is explored in a larger hypothesis space to achieve optimized sparse connectivity for the best performance. SCL overcomes the limitations of existing automatic pruning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that SCL can automatically learn and select important network connections for various baseline network structures. Deep learning models trained by SCL outperform the state-of-the-art human-designed and automatic pruning methods in sparsity, accuracy, and FLOPs reduction.",

        "Abstract": "The study expects to find a better way to improve the teaching quality of the education of college students' outlook on life, based on the theory of educational psychology. First, the relevant theories of positive psychology are introduced and expounded, and the importance of the education of college students' outlook on life is analyzed. Second, the current situations of college students' outlook on life and the education of their outlook on life are investigated through a questionnaire survey, and the problems presented in the questionnaire are analyzed. Then, the correlation between positive psychology and the education of college students' outlook on life is explored, and their mutual connection is analyzed. The results are as follows: 77.4% of the college students have periodical aims and work hard for them; 80.8% of the students think that the realization of life goals rely on hard work, accounting for the largest proportion; when they encounter setbacks, more than 80% of the students choose to work hard to overcome them; 69.2% students think that their outlook on life comes from self-learning and exploration. According to college students' outlook on life in China and other countries, there are many problems in the education of college students' outlook on life, and the teaching quality of the education of college students' outlook on life is backward. The combination of positive psychology and college students' education of college students' outlook on life under the theory of educational psychology provides new ideas and ways for college students' education of college students' outlook on life. The conclusion of this study promotes the innovation of the education of college students' outlook on life.",

        "Abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease associated with pain and disability. OA patients are at a high risk for venous thrombosis (VTE). Here, we developed an interpretable machine learning (ML)-based model to predict VTE risk in patients with OA. To establish a prediction model, we used six ML algorithms, of which 35 variables were employed. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used to screen the most related clinical variables associated with VTE. SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) were applied to interpret the ML mode and determine the importance of the selected features. Overall, 3169 patients with OA (average age: 66.52 \u00b1 7.28 years) were recruited from Xi'an Honghui Hospital. Of these, 352 and 2817 patients were diagnosed with and without VTE, respectively. The XGBoost algorithm showed the best performance. According to the RFE algorithms, 15 variables were retained for further modeling with the XGBoost algorithm. The top three predictors were Kellgren-Lawrence grade, age, and hypertension. Our study showed that the XGBoost model with 15 variables has a high potential to predict VTE risk in patients with OA.",

KGF-2 plays important roles in the regulation of cellular homeostasis and wound healing. In this study, we investigated the effect and underlying mechanism of KGF-2 on scar formation after wound healing both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. We show that KGF-2 attenuates mechanical stress-induced scar formation while promoting wound healing. Mechanistically, KGF-2 inhibits STAP-2 expression and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation, leading to significantly reduced collagen I and collagen III levels. Our results provide an insight into the role of KGF-2 in wound healing and scar formation and the therapeutic potential for reducing scarring while promoting wound healing.",

        "Abstract": "The infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP) and synovium are reported to act as a functional unit, with emerging roles in the pathophysiology of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the pathogenesis of KOA, especially in cartilage homeostasis regulation. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms of circRNAs in the KOA IPFP/synovium unit remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate alterations in the expression of circRNAs and predict their functions in the KOA IPFP/synovium unit using bioinformatics analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen are crucial parameters for catalyst characterization and catalytic oxidation mechanism. Therefore, rapid discrimination of adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen is highly desired. Herein, a direct correlation between cataluminescence (CTL) kinetic curve and oxygen species was discovered. The adsorbed oxygen-catalyzed CTL only lasted for a few minutes, whereas the lattice oxygen-catalyzed CTL could exhibit hours of continuous luminescence. The long-term CTL was attributed to the slow migration of lattice oxygen in a slow and continuous catalytic oxidation reaction. In addition to the discrimination between the adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen by the CTL kinetic processes, the corresponding CTL intensity was positively proportional to their amounts. Accordingly, the developed catalytic oxidation-related CTL can be used as an indicator for rapid discrimination and determination of adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen in catalysts. Oxygen species detected by the proposed CTL method not only matched well with those obtained by conventional X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and O",

        "Abstract": "Accurately predicting driving behavior can help to avoid potential improper maneuvers of human drivers, thus guaranteeing safe driving for intelligent vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel deep belief network (DBN), called MSR-DBN, by integrating a multi-target sigmoid regression (MSR) layer with DBN to predict the front wheel angle and speed of the ego vehicle. Precisely, the MSR-DBN consists of two sub-networks: one is for the front wheel angle, and the other one is for speed. This MSR-DBN model allows ones to optimize lateral and longitudinal behavior predictions through a systematic testing method. In addition, we consider the historical states of the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles and the driver's operations as inputs to predict driving behaviors in a real-world environment. Comparison of the prediction results of MSR-DBN with a general DBN model, back propagation (BP) neural network, support vector regression (SVR), and radical basis function (RBF) neural network, demonstrates that the proposed MSR-DBN outperforms the others in terms of accuracy and robustness.",

        "Abstract": "Collagen is the main component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and might play an important role in tumor microenvironments. However, the relationship between collagen and clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) is still not fully clarified. Hence, we aimed to establish a collagen-related signature to predict the prognosis and estimate the tumor immune microenvironment in ccRCC patients. Patients with a high risk score were often correlated with unfavorable overall survival (OS) and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. In addition, the collagen-related genetic signature was highly correlated with clinical pathological features and can be considered as an independent prognostic factor in ccRCC patients. Moreover, GSEA results show that patients with a high risk grade tend to be associated with epithelial-mesenchymal junctions (EMT) and immune responses. In this study, we developed a collagen-related gene signature, which might possess the potential to predict the prognosis and immune microenvironment of ccRCC patients and function as an independent prognostic factor in ccRCC.",

        "Abstract": "Traditional Chinese medicine has a long history of treating complex diseases, especially for the conditioning of systemic diseases. It has been reported that Baixianfeng (BXF) decoction used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may be due to its systemic regulatory effect, but the specific mechanism still remains to be elucidated. The research philosophy and methods of systemic pharmacology were used to explore the mechanism of BXF decoction in treating RA in this study. TCMSP database was used to search the ingredients of BXF decoction and screen the ADME parameters. The parameter index was set as OB\u00a0\u2265\u00a030%, DL\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.18, HL\u00a0\u2265\u00a04\u00a0h. The targets of the screened compounds were searched and predicted by TCMSP and Target-Prediction platforms. The disease targets of RA were obtained through the DisGeNET, OMIM, and PharmGkb databases. A series of network construction and analysis relied on Cytoscape 3.2.1 software, and the DAVID database was used for pathway enrichment. The adjuvant arthritis rat model was used for the verification of animal experiments to verify the predicted pathway results in terms of pathological phenotype, inflammatory factors, and pathway protein expression. The results showed that the related targets of 81 active ingredients in the drug crossed 56 targets of RA, and these common targets were enriched in 83 significant pathways, among which the TNF signaling pathway had research significance. Animal experiments have proved that BXF decoction was effective in treating adjuvant arthritis rats. The drug relieved the pathological phenotype of rats in dose-dependent. It reduced the serum content of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and reduced the gene expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in spleen tissue. In the cartilage tissue protein of rats, it inhibited the degradation of collagen \u2161 protein. Further, BXF decoction reduced the activation of p-PI3K, p-Akt, and p-P65 protein, and decreased the overexpression of apoptotic proteins such as cleaved-caspase8 and cleaved-caspase3 in cartilage tissue. Meanwhile, it inhibited the protein expression of MMP9, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2. In conclusion, this study successfully practiced the combination of systemic pharmacology and experimental verification, and clarified that BXF decoction inhibited the progression of adjuvant arthritis rats through the TNF-PI3K-Akt-NF-\u03baB signal axis. It provides new evidence for the study of the mechanism of BXF decoction in treating RA.",

        "Title": "Inhibition of histone deacetylation with vorinostat does not prevent tunicamycin-mediated acute kidney injury.",
        "Abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) caused by various mechanisms, including antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cisplatin, and radiocontrast. Tunicamycin (TM) is a nucleoside antibiotic that induces ER stress and is a commonly used model of AKI. 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) is a chemical chaperone and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and has been shown to protect the kidney from ER stress, apoptosis, and structural damage in a tunicamycin model of AKI. The renal protection provided by 4-PBA is attributed to its ability to prevent misfolded protein aggregation and inhibit ER stress; however, the HDAC inhibitor effects of 4-PBA have not been examined in the TM-induced model of AKI. As such, the main objective of this study was to determine if histone hyperacetylation provides any protective effects against TM-mediated AKI. The FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor vorinostat was used, as it has no ER stress inhibitory effects and therefore the histone hyperacetylation properties alone could be investigated. In vitro work demonstrated that vorinostat inhibited histone deacetylation in cultured proximal tubular cells but did not prevent ER stress or protein aggregation induced by TM. Vorinostat induced a significant increase in cell death, and exacerbated TM-mediated total cell death and apoptotic cell death. Wild type male mice were treated with TM (0.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection), with or without vorinostat (50 mg/kg/day) or 4-PBA (1 g/kg/day). Mice treated with 4-PBA or vorinostat exhibited similar levels of histone hyperacetylation. Expression of the pro-apoptotic protein CHOP was induced with TM, and not inhibited by vorinostat. Further, vorinostat did not prevent any renal damage or decline in renal function caused by tunicamycin. These data suggest that the protective mechanisms found by 4-PBA are primarily due to its molecular chaperone properties, and the HDAC inhibitors used did not provide any protection against renal injury caused by ER stress.",

        "Abstract": "There is growing evidence that cell behaviors can be influenced by the direct current electric fields (EFs). Some behaviors may influence wound healing directly. This study aimed to investigate the effects of EF (200 mV/mm) on immortalized nontumorigenic human epidermal (HaCaT) cells. We established a setup that can transmit an EF and maintain a stable cell culture environment. An EF was applied to HaCaT cells, and scratch-assays were performed as a model of wound healing to observe cell migration. Proliferation was evaluated by mitochondrial activity, total protein, and DNA content. Secretion of healing-associated cytokines was evaluated via cytokine arrays, and Western blot was applied to investigate signaling pathway alterations. Compared with the control group, the migration of cells exposed to EFs significantly increased (",

The repetition rate and pulse width of the laser are 183.6\u2005MHz and 3.7 ps, respectively. Such an all-fiber NPR mode-locked laser is then applied in time-stretch optical coherence tomography. The axial resolution is 12.1\u2005\u00b5m. The all-fiber high speed broadband swept laser based on the time stretching technique has compact structure and high stability, which is a promising source for frequency metrology and high resolution optical coherence tomography.",

We show that these mutations induce hypotrophic and disorganized eyes in Drosophila eye primordia. Restriction of H3K27me3 spread in H3.3K27M and its redistribution in H3.3K36M result in transcriptional deregulation of PRC2-targeted eye development and of piRNA biogenesis genes, including krimp. Notably, both mutants promote redistribution of H3K36me2 away from repetitive regions into active genes, which associate with retrotransposon de-repression in eye discs. Aberrant expression of krimp represses LINE retrotransposons but does not contribute to the eye phenotype. Depletion of H3K36me2 methyltransferase ash1 in H3.3K27M, and of PRC2 component E(z) in H3.3K36M, restores the expression of eye developmental genes and normal eye growth, showing that redistribution of antagonistic marks contributes to K-to-M pathogenesis. Our results implicate a novel function for H3K36me2 and showcase convergent downstream effects of oncohistones that target opposing epigenetic marks.",

        "Abstract": "We introduce an innovative solution approach to the challenging dynamic load-shedding problem which directly affects the stability of large power grid. Our proposed deep Q-network for load-shedding (DQN-LS) determines optimal load-shedding strategy to maintain power system stability by taking into account both spatial and temporal information of a dynamically operating power system, using a convolutional long-short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network to automatically capture dynamic features that are translation-invariant in short-term voltage instability, and by introducing a new design of the reward function. The overall goal for the proposed DQN-LS is to provide real-time, fast, and accurate load-shedding decisions to increase the quality and probability of voltage recovery. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach and its scalability to large-scale, complex dynamic problems, we utilize the China Southern Grid (CSG) to obtain our test results, which clearly show superior voltage recovery performance by employing the proposed DQN-LS under different and uncertain power system fault conditions. What we have developed and demonstrated in this study, in terms of the scale of the problem, the load-shedding performance obtained, and the DQN-LS approach, have not been demonstrated previously.",

        "Abstract": "Intracellular pH homeostasis is essential for the survival and function of biological cells. Negatively charged molecular probes, such as pyranine (HPTS), tend to exhibit poor salt tolerance and unsatisfactory cell permeability, limiting their widespread use in intracellular assays. Herein, we explored a charge neutralization strategy using multicharged cationic nanocarriers for an efficient and stable assembly with the pH-sensitive HPTS. Through immobilization and neutralization with poly(allylamine hydrochloride)-stabilized red-emitting gold nanoclusters (PAH-AuNCs), the resulting nanoprobes (HPTS-PAH-AuNCs) offered improved salt tolerance, satisfactory cell permeability, and dual-emission properties. The fluorescence ratio exhibited a linear response over the pH range of 3.0-9.0. Moreover, the proposed HPTS-PAH-AuNCs were successfully applied to determine and visualize lysosomal pH variations in living cells, which indicated great potential for biosensing and bioimaging applications in living systems. Benefiting from the charge neutralization strategy, various types of probes can be expected to achieve broader analytical applications.",

Many achievements on this material have been made in photocatalysis, but the advantages have not yet been fully explored in electrochemical fields. The bulk structure with low conductivity impedes charge-transfer kinetics during electrochemical processes. Excessive nitrogen content leads to insufficient charge transfer, while bulk structures produce tortuous channels for mass transport. Some attempts have been made to address these issues by nanostructure engineering, such as ultrathin structure design, heterogeneous composition, defect engineering, and morphology control. These structure-engineered nanomaterials have been successfully applied in electrochemical fields, including ionic actuators, flexible supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and electrochemical sensors. Herein, a timely review on the latest advances in graphitic carbon nitride through various engineering strategies for electrochemical applications has been summarized. A perspective on critical challenges and future research directions is highlighted for graphitic carbon nitride in electrochemistry on the basis of existing research works and our experimental experience.",

        "Abstract": "Pparg, a nuclear receptor, is downregulated in basal subtype bladder cancers that tend to be muscle invasive and amplified in luminal subtype bladder cancers that tend to be non-muscle invasive. Bladder cancers derive from the urothelium, one of the most quiescent epithelia in the body, which is composed of basal, intermediate, and superficial cells. We find that expression of an activated form of Pparg (VP16;Pparg) in basal progenitors induces formation of superficial cells in situ, that exit the cell cycle, and do not form tumors. Expression in basal progenitors that have been activated by mild injury however, results in luminal tumor formation. We find that these tumors are immune deserted, which may be linked to down-regulation of Nf-kb, a Pparg target. Interestingly, some luminal tumors begin to shift to basal subtype tumors with time, down-regulating Pparg and other luminal markers. Our findings have important implications for treatment and diagnosis of bladder cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by the gradual loss of renal function and is a major public health concern. Risk factors for CKD include hypertension and proteinuria, both of which are associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ER stress-induced TDAG51 protein expression is increased at an early time point in mice with CKD. Based on these findings, wild-type and TDAG51 knock-out (TDKO) mice were used in an angiotensin II/deoxycorticosterone acetate/salt model of CKD. Both wild-type and TDKO mice developed hypertension, increased proteinuria and albuminuria, glomerular injury, and tubular damage. However, TDKO mice were protected from apoptosis and renal interstitial fibrosis. Human proximal tubular cells were used to demonstrate that TDAG51 expression induces apoptosis through a CHOP-dependent mechanism. Further, a mouse model of intrinsic acute kidney injury demonstrated that CHOP is required for ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Renal fibroblasts were used to demonstrate that TGF-\u03b2 induces collagen production through an IRE1-dependent mechanism; cells treated with a TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1 inhibitor prevented XBP1 splicing, a downstream consequence of IRE1 activation. Interestingly, TDKO mice express significantly less TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1, thus, preventing TGF-\u03b2-mediated XBP1 splicing. In conclusion, TDAG51 induces apoptosis in the kidney through a CHOP-dependent mechanism, while contributing to renal interstitial fibrosis through a TGF-\u03b2-IRE1-XBP1 pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Thymoma is the most common primary mass in anterior mediastinum. Although associated with low malignancy, it is often accompanied by myasthenia gravis resulting in poor prognosis. Due to the dual factors of tumor immune tolerance and autoimmune reaction, it is urgent to understand the immune status of MG with thymoma. In this study, RNA sequencing data were obtained from the TCGA and GEO cohorts to identify differentially expressed messenger RNAs and infiltrated immune cells. A total of 121 samples in TCGA and 43 samples in GEO were screened out. The infiltrated immune cells were identified by CIBERSORT, in which Tfh cells and activated DC cells were abnormal in thymoma patients. The differently expressed genes were performed by package LIMMA. The functional characteristics of differently expression genes were analyzed by GO and KEGG; one GO and seven KEGG pathways were both found in both TCGA and GEO cohorts. Meanwhile, 27 common differently expressed genes were obtained and were displayed by a Venn diagram. The TRRUST was used to screen the hub genes for the common 27 different genes and 6 genes were found. Then, PPI networks were constructed. Subsequently, the relationship between SCNAs of common genes and related immune cells tested by TIMER. Kaplan-Meier plots, ROC curve and Cox's expression model for immune infiltration and hub genes were also tested. In conclusion, we found that two types of immune infiltrated cells and six hub genes can predict the occurrence of myasthenia gravis in thymoma patients.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, an all-fiber sensor based on hollow core Bragg fiber (HCBF) is proposed and successfully manufactured, which can be used for human breath monitoring. Benefiting from the identical outer diameters of HCBF and single mode fibers (SMFs), the sensor can be directly constructed by sandwiching a segment of HCBF between two SMFs. Based on optical propagation properties of HCBF, the transmission light is sensitive to specific environmental change induced by human breath. Thus, the breath signals can be explicitly recorded by measuring the intensity of the transmitted laser. The sensor presents a rapid response time of \u223c0.15 s and recovery time of \u223c0.65 s. In addition, the HCBF-based sensor shows good insensitivity to the variation of temperature and curvature, which enables its reliable sensing performance in the dynamic and changeful environment.",

        "Abstract": "To combat chromatic dispersion (CD) in intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) systems, three chirp-free demonstrations are experimentally performed with an iterative pre-electronic dispersion compensation (pre-EDC) algorithm at the transmitter end, for 28 GBaud non-return-to-zero on-off keying (NRZ-OOK), 56 GBaud NRZ-OOK and 28 GBaud four-level pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM-4) signals, over distances of 100 km, 50 km and 40 km of single mode fiber (SMF), respectively. The iterative pre-EDC algorithm is based on the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm, which treats the unconstrained phase at the direct detection receiver as a degree of freedom. At the receiver side, only a linear fractionally-spaced (T/2) post-feed-forward equalizer (post-FFE) is employed to combat the residual inter-symbol interference (ISI). Experimental results show that the aforementioned three demonstrations can approach the forward error correction (FEC) bit error rate (BER) threshold of 3.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910",

        "Abstract": "Childhood posterior fossa group A ependymomas (PFAs) have limited treatment options and bear dismal prognoses compared to group B ependymomas (PFBs). PFAs overexpress the oncohistone-like protein EZHIP (enhancer of Zeste homologs inhibitory protein), causing global reduction of repressive histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), similar to the oncohistone H3K27M. Integrated metabolic analyses in patient-derived cells and tumors, single-cell RNA sequencing of tumors, and noninvasive metabolic imaging in patients demonstrated enhanced glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolism in PFAs. Furthermore, high glycolytic gene expression in PFAs was associated with a poor outcome. PFAs demonstrated high EZHIP expression associated with poor prognosis and elevated activating mark histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac). Genomic H3K27ac was enriched in PFAs at key glycolytic and TCA cycle\u2013related genes including ",

        "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder has become an increasingly serious disease in the world. However, convenient antidepressants have low efficacy and slow onset defects, which is dangerous for suicidal tendency patients. Nowadays, rapid antidepressant research has become the focus. Merazin hydrate (MH), a component of the natural herb Fructus Aurantii, has been shown to produce rapid antidepressant-like effects in animal models. However, the mechanism of its rapid antidepressant-like effects was still elusive like that of ketamine. The study aimed to reveal the relationship between the rapid antidepressant-like effects of MH and mTOR signaling, which is closely related to rapid antidepressants. The results showed that a single administration of MH was capable of reversing the behavioral defects at 2 h in two classic depressive models including learned helplessness (LH) and chronic mild stress (CMS). Moreover, the phosphorylated expression of mTOR, reduced by LH or CMS, was upregulated after a single administration of MH, and the expressions of BDNF and synaptic proteins in the hippocampus were also reversed 2 h later, similar to ketamine. Moreover, LH increased the expressions of eNOS, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 in serum, which were all reversed by a single dose of MH at 2 h, similar to ketamine. Furthermore, we used rapamycin, an antagonist of mTOR, to confirm whether the rapid antidepressant-like effects of MH depend on mTOR or not. We found that inhibiting the activation of mTOR blocked the rapid antidepressant-like effects of MH, which also inhibited the upregulation of expressions of BDNF and PSD95. To sum up, the rapid antidepressant effect of MH depended on the activation of mTOR to regulate downstream BNDF and synaptic protein expressions.",

        "Abstract": "Membrane-disruptive peptides/peptidomimetics (MDPs) are antimicrobials or anticarcinogens that present a general killing mechanism through the physical disruption of cell membranes, in contrast to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, which act on precise targets such as DNA or specific enzymes. Owing to their rapid action, broad-spectrum activity, and mechanisms of action that potentially hinder the development of resistance, MDPs have been increasingly considered as future therapeutics in the drug-resistant era. Recently, growing experimental evidence has demonstrated that MDPs can also be utilized as adjuvants to enhance the therapeutic effects of other agents. In this review, we evaluate the literature around the broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties and anticancer activity of MDPs, and summarize the current development and mechanisms of MDPs alone or in combination with other agents. Notably, this review highlights recent advances in the design of various MDP-based drug delivery systems that can improve the therapeutic effect of MDPs, minimize side effects, and promote the co-delivery of multiple chemotherapeutics, for more efficient antimicrobial and anticancer therapy.",

It is quite challenging to treat CNS diseases efficiently because of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). It is a physical barrier with tight junction proteins and high selectivity to limit the substance transportation between the blood and neural tissues. Thus, it is important to understand BBB transport mechanisms for developing novel drug carriers to overcome the BBB. This paper introduces the structure of the BBB and its physiological transport mechanisms. Meanwhile, different strategies for crossing the BBB by using nanomaterial-based drug carriers are reviewed, including carrier-mediated, adsorptive-mediated, and receptor-mediated transcytosis. Since the viral-induced CNS diseases are associated with BBB breakdown, various neurotropic viruses and their mechanisms on BBB disruption are reviewed and discussed, which are considered as an alternative solution to overcome the BBB. Therefore, most recent studies on virus-mimicking nanocarriers for drug delivery to cross the BBB are also reviewed and discussed. On the other hand, the routes of administration of drug-loaded nanocarriers to the CNS have been reviewed. In sum, this paper reviews and discusses various strategies and routes of nano-formulated drug delivery systems across the BBB to the brain, which will contribute to the advanced diagnosis and treatment of CNS diseases.",

        "Abstract": "This study offers an efficient hardness identification approach to address the problem of poor real-time performance and accuracy in coal and rock hardness detection. To begin, Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) was performed on the current signal of the cutting motor to obtain a number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Further, the target signal was selected among the IMFs to reconstruct the current signal according to the energy density and correlation coefficient criteria. After that, the Multi-scale Permutation Entropy (MPE) of the reconstructed signal was trained by the Adaboost improved Back Propagation (BP) neural network, in order to establish the hardness recognition model. Finally, the cutting arm's swing speed and the cutting head's rotation speed were adjusted based on the coal and rock hardness. The simulation results indicated that using the energy density and correlation criterion to reconstruct the signal can successfully filter out noise interference. Compared to the BP model, the relative root-mean-square error of the Adaboost-BP model decreased by 0.0633, and the prediction results were more accurate. Additionally, the speed control strategy based on coal and rock hardness can ensure the efficient cutting of the roadheader.",

        "Abstract": "The abundant and heterogeneous distribution of toxic phenol from plastics has drawn worldwide attention. However, the common analysis methods failed to identify the accurate species of these phenolic hazards from plastics in a direct and nondestructive approach. Herein, we demonstrate the layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as a novel matrix in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) for low-molecular-weight phenols leaked from plastics. LDHs own abundant hydroxyl groups to facilitate chemoselectivity and ionization of phenols through the formation of hydrogen bonds with these phenols. More importantly, the LDH matrix could provide a distinguishable signal for the homolog and isomeride of these phenolic hazards. The developed method could realize nondestructive and in situ mapping of phenolic hazards in plastics. Our success could help to track the low-molecular-weight compounds liberated from plastics and supply spatial information for polluted plastics. We anticipated that the proposed approach could provide sufficient information to evaluate and alarm the safety of food packaging plastics.",

        "Abstract": "The anti-tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (anti-TNF-\u03b1) blocker, has shown great efficacy for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, systemic exposure to it can cause considerable safety problems due to reduced suppression of the systemic immune response and loss of response to the production of anti-drug antibodies. Thus, we try to devise a targeted vehicle system for oral administration of anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibodies for the treatment of IBD. In the present study, we developed an oral Infliximab (IFX) loaded nano-in-microparticles, based on chitosan (CS)/carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) and alginate (Alg), which could protect IFX from the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract and produce targeted drug delivery to the inflamed intestine. In vivo studies demonstrated that the IFX loaded nano-in-micro vehicle can alleviate colitis by ameliorating inflammation and maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier.",

The operation time, postoperative hospital stay, operation success rate, stone clearance rate, and surgical complications were evaluated between the two groups.For the RPUL and URL groups, respectively, the average operation time was 74.5\u200a\u00b1\u200a24.6\u200aminutes and 54.5\u200a\u00b1\u200a13.2\u200aminutes; the postoperative hospital stay was 5.8\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.4 days and 3.2\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.2 days; the operation success rate was 96.0% (144/150) and 85.3% (116/136); the incidence rate of complications was 3.5% (5/144) and 17.5% (18/103); and the stone clearance rate was 100% (144/144) and 88.8% (103/116), which were all statistically significant (P\u200a<\u200a.05).Both RPUL and URL had the advantages of low trauma and fast recovery rate for patients with upper ureteral calculi. However, patients who underwent RPUL showed higher success and fewer complication rate. RPUL might be a safe and effective laparoscopic method for the treatment of patients with upper ureteral calculi.",

        "Abstract": "An autoimmune disease is an inappropriate response to one's tissues due to a break in immune tolerance and exposure to self-antigens. It often leads to structural and functional damage to organs and systemic disorders. To date, there are no effective interventions to prevent the progression of autoimmune diseases. Hence, there is an urgent need for new treatment targets. TRPM7 is an enzyme-coupled, transient receptor ion channel of the subfamily M that plays a vital role in pathologic and physiologic conditions. While TRPM7 is constitutively activated under certain conditions, it can regulate cell migration, polarization, proliferation and cytokine secretion. However, a growing body of evidence highlights the critical role of TRPM7 in autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and diabetes. Herein, we present (a) a review of the channel kinase properties of TRPM7 and its pharmacological properties, (b) discuss the role of TRPM7 in immune cells (neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells) and its upstream immunoreactive substances, and (c) highlight TRPM7 as a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Proteins and peptides have become a significant therapeutic modality for various diseases because of their high potency and specificity. However, the inherent properties of these drugs, such as large molecular weight, poor stability, and conformational flexibility, make them difficult to be formulated and delivered. Injection is the primary route for clinical administration of protein and peptide drugs, which usually leads to poor patient's compliance. As a portable, minimally invasive device, microneedles (MNs) can overcome the skin barrier and generate reversible microchannels for effective macromolecule permeation. In this review, we highlighted the recent advances in MNs-mediated transdermal delivery of protein and peptide drugs. Emphasis was given to the latest development in representative MNs design and fabrication. We also summarize the current application status of MNs-mediated transdermal protein and peptide delivery, especially in the field of infectious disease, diabetes, cancer, and other disease therapy. Finally, the current status of clinical translation and a perspective on future development are also provided.",

        "Abstract": "Tandem mass tag (TMT)-coupled liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry is a powerful method to investigate synovial tissue protein profiles in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). Protein was isolated from synovial tissue samples of 22 patients and labeled with a TMT kit. Over 500 proteins were identified as the differential expression protein on comparing RA and OA synovial tissue, including 239 upregulated and 271 downregulated proteins. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD027703. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that the majority participated in the developmental processes and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4), a secreted glycoprotein, in joint inflammation of RA was explored. OLFM4 was upregulated in RA synovial tissue samples. In fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), inflammation cytokines, TNF-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and LPS can upregulate OLFM4. After OLFM4 knockdown under TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, RA FLS proliferation was inhibited and the expression of CXCL9, CXCL11, and MMP-1 was decreased. Overall, the RA synovial tissue protein expression profile by proteomic analysis shows some unique targets in RA pathophysiology, and OLFM4 in FLS plays an important role in RA joint inflammation. OLFM4 can be a promising therapeutic target in RA synovial tissue.",

End-to-end conditional distribution tracking enables an adaptive decoding of optical IMDD signals, with robustness to the bias point shift of the optical intensity modulator. Experimental demonstration is conducted over a 20-Gbits/s optical pulse amplitude modulation-4 (PAM-4) modulation system. Optical PAM-4 signals are optically down-sampled by short pulses to 250 Msa/s. Then, statistical characters of signal distribution can be estimated using inline GMM processing. Due to the real-time learned distribution, intelligent decoding of received signals exhibits a perfect adaptation to the changing bias point of a Mach-Zendner intensity modulator, enhancing the communication reliability with bit error rate (BER) below 3.8\u22c510",

        "Abstract": "The F-box and WD-repeat-containing protein 2 (FBXW2) plays a crucial role as an E3 ligase in regulating tumorigenesis. However, the functions of FBXW2 in breast cancer are still unknown. Here, we find that nuclear factor-kB (NF-\u03baB) p65 is a new substrate of FBXW2. FBXW2 directly binds to p65, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation. Interestingly, p300 acetylation of p65 blocks FBXW2 induced p65 ubiquitination. FBXW2-p65 axis is a crucial regulator of SOX2-induced stemness in breast cancer. Moreover, FBXW2 inhibits breast tumor growth by regulating p65 degradation in vitro and in vivo. FBXW2 overexpression abrogates the effects of p65 on paclitaxel resistance in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, FBXW2 induced p65 degradation is also confirmed in FBXW2-knockout mice. Our results identify FBXW2 as an important E3 ligase for p65 degradation, which provide insights into the tumor suppressor functions of FBXW2 in breast cancer.",

Abnormal levels of LF in the human body are related to some serious diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, Alzheimer's disease and dry eye disease. Recent studies indicate that LF can be used as a biomarker for diagnosis of these diseases. Many methods have been developed to detect the level of LF. In this review, the biofunctions of LF and its potential to work as a biomarker are introduced. In addition, the current methods of detecting lactoferrin have been presented and discussed. We hope that this review will inspire efforts in the development of new sensing systems for LF detection.",

        "Abstract": "We report a novel long range distributed fiber optic vibration sensor using two counter-propagating interferometers, which are space-division multiplexed in different cores of a seven-core fiber. The proposed system requires only one laser source. Thanks to the spatially separated structure of the two interferometers, it no longer suffers from the coherent Rayleigh backscattering noise, and, since forward transmitting CW light instead of weak backscattering light is used, as a result, the sensing range can be significantly extended. On the other hand, because the two interferometers are implemented in one single compact multicore fiber, the output temporal waveforms have good correlation; therefore, the sampled waveforms can be used directly to determine the vibration location through cross correlation, and no additional complicated data processing (e.g., time-frequency analysis methods) is required. For proof of concept, we achieved distributed vibration detection with 38.5 km sensing range, and the root mean square error of positioning is estimated to be about 54.9 m with 120 measurements. The proposed system has the unique advantages of simple setup, high sensitivity, large dynamic range, ultra-long sensing range, etc.",

        "Abstract": "Psychological account hypothesizes that premature ejaculation (PE) is a learned pattern of rapid ejaculation maintained by anxiety about sexual failure, whereas neuropsychological accounts hypothesizes that PE is the result of dysfunction of central nervous system regulating ejaculatory. However, the central neural mechanism underlying PE patients with anxiety remains unclear. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected in 20 PE (diagnoses based on PE Guidelines drafted by the International Society for Sexual Medicine [ISSM]) patients with anxiety and 25 matched healthy controls (HCs) from January 2019 to December 2020. The values of fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) were compared between groups. Moreover, the correlations between fALFF and the severity of PE and anxiety of patients were examined. PE patients with anxiety had increased fALFF values in the right inferior frontal gyrus (opercular part) and middle frontal gyrus. In addition, significant positive correlations were found between the scores of PE diagnostic tool (PEDT) and fALFF values of the right inferior frontal gyrus (opercular part), as well as the right middle frontal gyrus. Moreover, fALFF values of the right inferior frontal gyrus (opercular part) and middle frontal gyrus were positively correlated with the scores of self-rating anxiety scale (SAS). Our results suggested that increased attentional network activity might play a critical role in the neural basis of PE patients with anxiety.",

        "Abstract": "Glucocorticoid (GC; dexamethasone, DEX) -induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (GIOFH) is a challenging orthopedic disease, and its underlying mechanism remains not clear. This study exposed murine long bone osteocyte-Y4 (MLO-Y4) cells to DEX below normoxic or hypoxic circumstances and found that cell autophagy have been reduced. At the same time, flow cytometry analysis showed increased apoptosis, which was more pronounced in hypoxic environments. Recent research also claimed that GC induces osteoporosis after osteocyte apoptosis, and subsequent microfractures lead to ischemia and hypoxia of the femoral head, resulted in GIOFH. Presently, we found that both mitophagy-related protein hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and BNIP3 were up-regulated in the hypoxic environment, and their expression was down-regulated when exposed to DEX. Besides, we demonstrated that overexpressing HIF-1\u03b1 resisted DEX-induced apoptosis in a hypoxic environment. Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of HIF-1\u03b1, through its downstream marker BNIP3, reduced the suppression of DEX on mitophagy induced by hypoxia and protected bone cells from apoptosis. Also, these findings may provide a direction of the promising application for better GIOFH treatment shortly.",

        "Abstract": "It is of great significance to disclose the diverse aging pathways for polymers under multiple factors, so as to predict and control the potential aging evolution. However, the current methods fail to distinguish multiple pathways (multi-paths) of polymer aging due to the lack of spatiotemporal resolution. In this work, using polyimide as a model polymer, the hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups from the polyimide aging process were labeled using specific fluorescent probes through boron-oxygen, imine, and thiourea linkages, respectively. When the excitation and emission wavelengths of each fluorescent probe were controlled, the multi-paths in polyimide aging can be visualized individually and simultaneously in three-dimensional fluorescent images. The overall aging process under hydrothermal treatment was destructured into the pyrolysis and hydrolysis pathways. Three-dimensional dynamic studies discovered that the increased humidity, along with the decreased oxygen content, could hamper the pyrolysis reaction and accelerate the hydrolysis reaction, leading to severe degradation of the overall polyimide aging. More importantly, the oxygen showed a higher regulation coefficient in accelerating the pyrolysis reaction, than the water vapor in motivating the hydrolysis reactions. Such a multidimensional identification methodology is able to guide the long-term use of polymers and control their aging process to a harmless direction in advance by tuning the contents of oxygen and water vapor.",

        "Abstract": "A low-complexity sparse absolute-term based nonlinear equalizer (AT-NLE) is proposed to eliminate the nonlinear signal distortions for intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) systems. By performing the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm to adaptively obtain the significant kernels of both the linear and absolute terms, the computational complexity of the proposed sparse AT-NLE is dramatically reduced and independent of the memory length. The performance of the proposed sparse AT-NLE is experimentally evaluated in a C-band 56-Gbit/s four-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM-4) system over a 30-km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF). Experimental results show that compared with the conventional diagonally-pruned Volterra nonlinear equalizer (DP-VNLE) or DP-AT-NLE, the proposed sparse AT-NLE saves 77.7% or 76% real-valued multiplications when their achieved bit error ratios (BERs) are similar. Meanwhile, the proposed sparse AT-NLE reduces the computational complexity by > 28% compared to the sparse DP-VNLE at a BER of 5 \u00d7 10",

        "Abstract": "Little is known about how the aberrant structural and functional connectivity relates to the rapid ejaculation. Data of diffusion tensor imaging and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging were acquired from 32 PE patients and 38 healthy controls (HCs). Firstly, we investigated the structural connectivity (SC) disruptions of PE patients using the method of graph theoretical analysis. Brain regions with impaired nodal strength were then defined as regions of interest (ROI). Secondly, the corresponding functional connectivity (FC) changes were explored. Finally, the correlation analyses were performed between brain areas with abnormal connectivity and clinical characteristics. Structural analysis revealed that PE patients had increased nodal strength in the right superior frontal gyrus (dorsolateral), left middle frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus (medial), right superior frontal gyrus (medial orbital) and decreased nodal strength in the left amygdala. FC analysis revealed that PE patients had decreased FC values in the default mode network, visual recognition network and subcortical network, as well as increased FC values in the attention network. Moreover, correlation analysis revealed that the nodal strength of right superior frontal gyrus (dorsolateral) was negatively associated with the intra-vaginal ejaculation latency, while FC values between the left middle frontal gyrus and middle occipital gyrus were positively related to the total scores of the premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT). Our results indicated that PE might be associated with the abnormal SC of areas in the prefrontal-amygdala pathway and aberrant FC in certain functional brain networks, especially in default mode network.",

        "Title": "Vitamin A and retinoic acid accelerate the attenuation of intestinal adaptability upon feeding induced by high-fat diet in mice.",
        "Abstract": "With its unique cellular plasticity, the small intestinal mucosa exhibits efficient adaptability upon feeding. However, little is known about the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding on this adaption and its underlying mechanism. Herein, we demonstrated that the cell proliferation ability, mitochondrial morphology, and global transcriptomic profile of the small intestine exhibited a prominent discrepancy between the fasted and refed state in mice, which were markedly attenuated by long-term HFD feeding. The retinol (Vitamin A, VA) metabolism pathway was dramatically affected by HFD feeding in the small intestine. Both VA and its active metabolite retinoic acid (RA), with the administration of lipid micelles, promoted the expression of genes involved in lipid absorption and suppressed the expression of genes involved in the cell proliferation of intestinal organoids. Via chip-qPCR and RT-qPCR, genes involved in lipid metabolism and cell proliferation were target genes of RAR\u03b1/RXR\u03b1\u00a0in small intestinal organoids treated with RA and lipid micelles. The role of VA in the in vivo attenuation of intestinal adaptability, in response to HFD, was evaluated. Mice were fed a normal chow diet, HFD, or HFD diet supplemented with additional 1.5-fold VA for 12 weeks. VA supplementation in HFD accelerated the attenuation of intestinal adaptability upon feeding induced by HFD, promoted lipid absorption gene expression, and increased body weight and serum cholesterol levels. In conclusion, the discrepancy of the small intestine between the fasted and refed state was dramatically attenuated by HFD feeding, in which VA and RA might play important roles.",

        "Abstract": "Lactobacilli are often recognized as beneficial partners in human microbial environments. However, lactobacilli also cause diseases in human, e.g. infective endocarditis (IE), septicaemia, rheumatic vascular disease, and dental caries. Therefore, the identification of potential pathogenic traits associated with lactobacilli will facilitate the prevention and treatment of the diseases caused by lactobacilli. Herein, we investigated the genomic traits and pathogenic potential of a novel bacterial strain Lactobacillus paracasei LP10266 which has caused a case of IE. We isolated L. paracasei LP10266 from an IE patient's blood to perform high-throughput sequencing and compared the genome of strain LP10266 with those of closely related lactobacilli to determine genes associated with its infectivity. We performed the antimicrobial susceptibility testing on strain LP10266. We assessed its virulence by mouse lethality and serum bactericidal assays as well as its serum complement- and platelet-activating ability. The biofilm formation and adherence of strain LP10266 were also studied.",

        "Abstract": "Electrochemical sensors are critical to artificial intelligence by virtue of capability of mimicking human skin to report sensing signals. But their practical applications are restricted by low sensitivity and limited cycling stability, which result from piezoionic mechanism with insufficient sensing response. Here, we report a highly sensitive ultrastable sensor based on proton-coupled electron transfer, which is different from piezoionic mechanism. The sensor gives a high sensing signal output of 117 mV, which is 16 times higher than that of counterpart device (7 mV). It delivers excellent working stability with performance retention as high as 99.13% over 10\u202f000 bending cycles in air, exceeding that of the best-known sensors reported previously. The flexible sensor displays high sensitivity in detecting real-time signals of human activities with large and subtle deformations, including wrist bending, moving speed, pulse wave and voice vibration. Smart functions, such as braille language and handwriting recognitions, are demonstrated for artificial intelligence.",

        "Abstract": "Epilepsy is a complex brain disorder characterized by repetitive seizure events. Epilepsy patients often suffer from various and severe physical and psychological comorbidities (e.g., anxiety, migraine, and stroke). While general comorbidity prevalences and incidences can be estimated from epidemiological data, such an approach does not take into account that actual patient-specific risks can depend on various individual factors, including medication. This motivates to develop a machine learning approach for predicting risks of future comorbidities for individual epilepsy patients. In this work, we use inpatient and outpatient administrative health claims data of around 19,500 U.S. epilepsy patients. We suggest a dedicated multimodal neural network architecture (Deep personalized LOngitudinal convolutional RIsk model-DeepLORI) to predict the time-dependent risk of six common comorbidities of epilepsy patients. We demonstrate superior performance of DeepLORI in a comparison with several existing methods. Moreover, we show that DeepLORI-based predictions can be interpreted on the level of individual patients. Using a game theoretic approach, we identify relevant features in DeepLORI models and demonstrate that model predictions are explainable in light of existing knowledge about the disease. Finally, we validate the model on independent data from around 97,000 patients, showing good generalization and stable prediction performance over time.",

        "Abstract": "Oncogenic histone lysine-to-methionine mutations block the methylation of their corresponding lysine residues on wild-type histones. One attractive model is that these mutations sequester histone methyltransferases, but genome-wide studies show that mutant histones and histone methyltransferases often do not colocalize. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), here, we show that, in fission yeast, even though H3K9M-containing nucleosomes are broadly distributed across the genome, the histone H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 is mainly sequestered at pericentric repeats. This selective sequestration of Clr4 depends not only on H3K9M but also on H3K14 ubiquitylation (H3K14ub), a modification deposited by a Clr4-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In\u00a0vitro, H3K14ub synergizes with H3K9M to interact with Clr4 and potentiates the inhibitory effects of H3K9M on Clr4 enzymatic activity. Moreover, binding kinetics show that H3K14ub overcomes the Clr4 aversion to H3K9M and reduces its dissociation. The selective sequestration model reconciles previous discrepancies and demonstrates the importance of protein-interaction kinetics in regulating biological processes.",

        "Abstract": "Testicular cancer is the most common malignant tumor in young men, and its incidence has increased in recent years. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the development and progression of tumors; however, the TME of testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) is poorly understood. In this study, we downloaded information for 156 TGCT cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, used the ESTIMATE method to determine immune and stromal scores, and used CIBERSORT to calculate the proportion of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs). The differentially expressed genes were subjected to a COX regression analysis and used for the construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) was identified as a predictive marker by combining the results of the Cox regression analysis and PPI network. A survival analysis showed that TLR2 was positively correlated with TGCT survival. A gene set enrichment analysis indicated that genes in the high TLR2 expression group were enriched for cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and the chemokine signaling pathway, and genes in the low TLR2 expression group were mainly enriched in the spliceosome. Regarding proportions of TICs, naive B cells and follicular helper T cells were negatively correlated with the expression of TLR2. This suggests that as TLR2 expression increases, the immunocompetence of the TME decreases. The expression of TLR2 may affect the prognosis of TGCT, suggesting that this locus can be used as a prognostic factor for TGCT.",

        "Abstract": "High-efficiency chemiluminescence (CL) resonance energy transfer (CRET) can be obtained by shortening the donor-acceptor distance and/or improving the luminescence efficiency of CRET acceptors. However, careful design and stringent experimental conditions are usually required for the ordered assembly of CRET acceptors on support materials to avoid aggregation-caused quenching problems. In this work, an aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active fluorophore was disorderly adsorbed on the surface of layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which could exhibit high-efficiency luminescence.

        "Abstract": "We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel interference fading suppression method for phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometry (\u03c6-OTDR) using space-division multiplexed (SDM) pulse probes in a few-mode fiber. The SDM probes consist of multiple different modes, and three spatial modes (LP01, LP11a, and LP11b) are used in this work for the proof of concept. Firstly, the Rayleigh backscattering light of different modes is experimentally characterized, and it turns out that the waveforms of the \u03c6-OTDR traces for distinct modes are all different and independent. Thanks to the spatial difference of the fading positions for distinct modes, multiple probes from spatially multiplexed modes can be used to suppress the interference fading in \u03c6-OTDR. Then, the performances of the \u03c6-OTDR systems using a single probe and multiple probes are evaluated and compared. Specifically, the statistical analysis shows that the fading probabilities over both the fiber length and the time scale are reduced significantly by using multiple SDM probes, which verifies the significant performance improvement on fading suppression. By introducing the concept of SDM to \u03c6-OTDR, the proposed novel interference fading suppression method avoids the complicated frequency or phase modulation, which has the advantages of simplicity, good effectiveness and high reliability.",

Donor phosphorescent molecules emits light when encapsulated into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) through hydrogen bond interactions, and acceptor fluorescent molecules emits light when doped into PVA through cation-\u03c0 interactions and hydrogen bond interactions. In addition, the triplet to singlet energy transfer process and mechanism are proved using the energy diagram and lifetime. The broadband emission color of the obtained composite film can be easily modulated by simply adjusting the amount and component of dyes, especially the white emission with CIE coordinates of (0.339, 0.337).

        "Abstract": "The living supramolecular polymerization technique provides an exciting research avenue. However, in comparison with the thermodynamic spontaneous nucleation, using simple monomers to realize living supramolecular polymerization is hardly possible from an energy principle. This is because the activation barrier of kinetically trapped simple monomer (nucleation step) is insufficiently high to control the kinetics of subsequent elongation. Here, with the benefit of the confinement from the layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanomaterial, various simple monomers, (such as benzene, naphthalene and pyrene derivatives) successfully form living supramolecular polymer (LSP) with length control and narrow dispersity. The degree of polymerization can reach ~6000. Kinetics studies reveal LDH overcomes a huge energy barrier to inhibit undesired spontaneous nucleation of monomers and disassembly of metastable states. The universality of this strategy will usher exploration into other multifunctional molecules and promote the development of functional LSP.",

        "Abstract": "Bladder cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. Accordingly, its incidence and mortality are high. One of the characteristics of cancer is genomic instability. New studies suggest that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in maintaining genomic instability. This study aimed to identify a genomic instability-associated lncRNA signature to predict the outcome of patients with bladder cancer. We downloaded data for bladder cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas database to obtain lncRNA expression profiles as well as somatic mutation profiles. Using the lncRNA computational framework, a genomic instability-related lncRNA signature (GIlncSig) was established and the prognostic value of this signature was assessed and validated. A five-lncRNA signature based on genomic instability (CFAP58-DT, MIR100HG, LINC02446, AC078880.3, and LINC01833) was obtained from 58 differentially expressed lncRNAs. Patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups, with the high-risk group having a substantially worse prognosis than the low-risk group. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses indicated that GIlncSig may be an independent prognostic factor; this finding was subsequently validated. In addition, enrichment analysis indicated that GIlncSig is associated with genomic instability in bladder cancer. GIlncSig has a predictive value for the prognosis of bladder cancer patients and provides guidance for the clinical treatment of these patients.",

        "Abstract": "Keratinocyte growth factor-2 (KGF-2) can regulate the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocyte, which plays a remarkable role in maintaining normal tissue structure and promoting wound healing. As an effective strategy, KGF-2 solution is widely used in the treatment of wounds in clinical applications. However, KGF-2 in solution cannot achieve sustained release, which results in drug loss and unnecessary waste. Polysaccharide hemostasis microspheres (PHMs) are an ideal drug loading platform due to their special \"lotus seedpod surface-like\" morphology and structure. Herein, to realize the controllable release of KGF-2, PHMs loaded with KGF-2 (KGF-2@PHMs) were prepared. It was found that the bioavailability of KGF-2 was improved greatly. Most importantly, KGF-2@PHMs can reduce inflammation and accelerate the wound healing process due to the controlled release of KGF-2. KGF-2@PHMs might be a potential alternative strategy for wound healing in future clinical applications.",

        "Abstract": "Singular value decomposition (SVD) is one of the most effective algorithms in recommender systems (RSs). Due to the iterative nature of SVD algorithms, one big challenge is initialization that has a major impact on the convergence and performance of RSs. Unfortunately, existing SVD algorithms in the literature typically initialize the user and item features in a random manner; thus, data information is not fully utilized. This work addresses the challenge of developing an efficient initialization method for SVD algorithms. We propose a general neural embedding initialization framework, where a low-complexity probabilistic autoencoder neural network initializes the features of user and item. This framework supports explicit and implicit feedback data sets. The design details of our proposed framework are elaborated and discussed. Experimental results show that RSs based on our proposed initialization framework outperform the state-of-the-art methods in rating prediction. Moreover, regarding item ranking, our proposed framework shows an improvement of at least 2.20% ~5.74% than existing SVD algorithms and other matrix factorization methods in the literature.",

        "Abstract": "Methylation of cytosine in CpG dinucleotides and histone lysine and arginine residues is a chromatin modification that critically contributes to the regulation of genome integrity, replication, and accessibility. A strong correlation exists between the genome-wide distribution of DNA and histone methylation, suggesting an intimate relationship between these epigenetic marks. Indeed, accumulating literature reveals complex mechanisms underlying the molecular crosstalk between DNA and histone methylation. These in vitro and in vivo discoveries are further supported by the finding that genes encoding DNA- and histone-modifying enzymes are often mutated in overlapping human diseases. Here, we summarize recent advances in understanding how DNA and histone methylation cooperate to maintain the cellular epigenomic landscape. We will also discuss the potential implication of these insights for understanding the etiology of, and developing biomarkers and therapies for, human congenital disorders and cancers that are driven by chromatin abnormalities.",

        "Abstract": "Since its birth in 1967, the utilization of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) has made substantial progress in a variety of fields for its unique features. However, the quantitative relationship between CRET efficiency and donor-acceptor distance has not yet been determined owing to the difficulty in designing the variable lengths between chemiluminescent donors and acceptors. Herein, we synthesized three kinds of tetraphenylethene (TPE)-anchored cationic surfactants with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics. For the first time, it is quantitatively demonstrated that the CRET efficiency is inversely proportional to the sixth power of distance between luminol donors and TPE acceptors. The details disclosed in this contribute have provided the solid evidence that CRET follows F\u00f6rster resonance theory. Our strategy would build a promising platform to control donor-acceptor distance, allowing to the interdisciplinary applications of CRET.",

Inspired by the modular design in bioengineering, herein we report a new class of small amphiphilic scorpionlike peptidomimetics based on this strategy. These HDP mimics show potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria without drug resistance but with a high therapeutic index.

        "Abstract": "Distributed acoustic sensors (DASs) have the capability of registering faint vibrations with high spatial resolution along the sensing fiber. Advanced algorithms are important for DAS in many applications since they can help extract and classify the unique signatures of different types of vibration events. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have powerful spectro-temporal feature learning capability, are well suited for event classification in DAS. Generally, these data-driven methods are highly dependent on the availability of large quantities of training data for learning a mapping from input to output. In this work, to fully utilize the collected information and maximize the power of CNNs, we propose a method to enlarge the useful dataset for CNNs from two aspects. First, we propose an intensity and phase stacked CNN (IP-CNN) to utilize both the intensity and phase information from a DAS with coherent detection. Second, we propose to use data augmentation to further increase the training dataset size. The influence of different data augmentation methods on the performance of the proposed CNN architecture is thoroughly investigated. The experimental results show that the proposed IP-CNN with data augmentation produces a classification accuracy of 88.2% on our DAS dataset with 1km sensing length. This indicates that the usage of both intensity and phase information together with the enlarged training dataset after data augmentation can greatly improve the classification accuracy, which is useful for DAS pattern recognition in real applications.",

        "Abstract": "Novosphingobium sp. ES2-1 is an efficient 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2)-degrading bacterium, which can convert E2 to estrone (E1), then to 4-hydroxyestrone (4-OH-E1) for subsequent oxidative cracking. In this study, the molecular bases for this process were elucidated. Two novel monooxygenase systems EstP and EstO were shown to catalyse the oxygenation of E1 and 4-OH-E1, respectively. EstP was a three-component cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system consisting of EstP1 (P450 monooxygenase), EstP2 (ferredoxin) and EstP3 (ferredoxin reductase). Ultraperformance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) analysis revealed that EstP catalysed the 4-hydroxylation of E1 to produce 4-OH-E1. The resultant 4-OH-E1 was further oxidized by a two-component monooxygenase system EstO consisting of EstO1 (flavin-dependent monooxygenases) and EstO2 (flavin reductase). UPLC-HRMS combined with ",

        "Abstract": "COVID-19 cases have surpassed the 109\u2009+\u2009million markers, with deaths tallying up to 2.4 million. Tens of thousands of papers regarding COVID-19 have been published along with countless bibliometric analyses done on COVID-19 literature. Despite this, none of the analyses have focused on domain entities occurring in scientific publications. However, analysis of these bio-entities and the relations among them, a strategy called entity metrics, could offer more insights into knowledge usage and diffusion in specific cases. Thus, this paper presents an entitymetric analysis on COVID-19 literature. We construct an entity-entity co-occurrence network and employ network indicators to analyze the extracted entities. We find that ACE-2 and C-reactive protein are two very important genes and that lopinavir and ritonavir are two very important chemicals, regardless of the results from either ranking.",

        "Abstract": "Steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SIONFH) has been a common disease following corticosteroid therapy. Presently, we aim to explore the functions of circular RNA (circ) PVT1 in SIONFH rats and the underlying mechanism. Glucocorticoid (GC) was used to treat SD rats and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to construct SIONFH model in vitro and in vivo, respectively. The pathological injury of the femoral head in the SIONFH rats was detected via haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The osteogenic differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis of BMSCs were detected. Western blot was used to detect Smad7, Bax, Bcl2 and Smad2/3. The potential targets of circPVT1 and miR-21-5p were validated through luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA pull-down assay, respectively. We found that CircPVT1 was decreased in the femoral head of SIONFH rats and GC-treated BMSCs, while miR-21-5p was markedly up-regulated. Overexpressed circPVT1 attenuated the apoptosis and cell viability inhibition of BMSCs induced by GC, while miR-21-5p up-regulation had the opposite effects. What's more, the in vivo experiments confirmed that up-regulating circPVT1 repressed osteonecrosis in SIONFH rats through repressing apoptosis. Mechanistically, circPVT1 functioned as a ceRNA of miR-21-5p, which targeted at the 3'untranslated region of Smad7. CircPVT1 enhancing Smad7 and mitigating GC activated TGF\u03b2/Smad2/3 pathway through inhibiting miR-21-5p. In conclusion, CircPVT1 exerts protective effects against SIONFH via modulating miR-21-5p-mediated Smad7/TGF\u03b2 pathway.",

Using circular holes for grating cells, simulated coupling losses reach -3.88 dB at 1550 nm and -5.78 dB at 1563 nm with 1-dB bandwidths of 49 nm and 45 nm for P-polarized and S-polarized light inputs, respectively. Experimentally, peak coupling losses of -5.13 dB at 1561 nm and -7.6 dB at 1568 nm are obtained for P-polarized and S-polarized light inputs, respectively, and corresponding 1 dB bandwidths are about 30 nm. An approach to improve the coupling performance of the grating coupler is also proposed using two crossing ellipses as grating cells as well as a bottom metal reflector. The coupling loss and the polarization dependent loss are decreased to around -3.4 dB and 0.44 dB, respectively.",

        "Title": "Virus-inspired surface-nanoengineered antimicrobial liposome: A potential system to simultaneously achieve high activity and selectivity.",
        "Abstract": "Enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 frequently have a highly infectious nature and are considered effective natural delivery systems exhibiting high efficiency and specificity. Since simultaneously enhancing the activity and selectivity of lipopeptides is a seemingly unsolvable problem for conventional chemistry and pharmaceutical approaches, we present a biomimetic strategy to construct lipopeptide-based mimics of viral architectures and infections to enhance their antimicrobial efficacy while avoiding side effects. Herein, a surface-nanoengineered antimicrobial liposome (SNAL) is developed with the morphological features of enveloped viruses, including a moderate size range, lipid-based membrane structure, and highly lipopeptide-enriched bilayer surface. The SNAL possesses virus-like infection to bacterial cells, which can mediate high-efficiency and high-selectivity bacteria binding, rapidly attack and invade bacteria via plasma membrane fusion pathway, and induce a local \"burst\" release of lipopeptide to produce irreversible damage of cell membrane. Remarkably, viral mimics are effective against multiple pathogens with low minimum inhibitory concentrations (1.6-6.3\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL",

        "Abstract": "Morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases rank first among all human illnesses. Many pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear, while misuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Infectious diseases spread rapidly and pathogens mutate quickly, posing new threats to human health. However, with the increasing use of high-throughput screening of pathogen genomes, research based on big data mining and visualization analysis has gradually become a hot topic for studies of infectious disease prevention and control. In this paper, the framework was performed on four infectious pathogens (Fusobacterium, Streptococcus, Neisseria, and Streptococcus salivarius) through five functions: 1) genome annotation, 2) phylogeny analysis based on core genome, 3) analysis of structure differences between genomes, 4) prediction of virulence genes/factors with their pathogenic mechanisms, and 5) prediction of resistance genes/factors with their signaling pathways. The experiments were carried out from three angles: phylogeny (macro perspective), structure differences of genomes (micro perspective), and virulence and drug-resistance characteristics (prediction perspective). Therefore, the framework can not only provide evidence to support the rapid identification of new or unknown pathogens and thus plays a role in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, but also help to recommend the most appropriate strains for clinical and scientific research. This paper presented a new genome information visualization analysis process framework based on big data mining technology with the accommodation of the depth and breadth of pathogens in molecular level research.",

        "Title": "Vitamin D receptor inhibits EMT via regulation of the epithelial mitochondrial function in intestinal fibrosis.",
        "Abstract": "We previously showed that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays a crucial role in acute inflammatory bowel disease and that intestinal fibrosis is a common complication of Crohn's disease (CD). Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important hallmark of fibrogenesis through which epithelial cells lose their epithelial phenotype and transform into mesenchymal cells. It is known that the VDR plays an essential role in epithelial integrity and mitochondrial function, but its role in intestinal fibrosis remains unknown. Here, we investigated whether the VDR is involved in epithelial mitochondrial dysfunction that results in EMT in intestinal fibrosis. Using human CD samples, intestine-specific VDR-KO mice, and fibroblast cellular models, we showed that the expression of the VDR was significantly lower in intestinal stenotic areas than in nonstenotic areas in patients with chronic CD. Genetic deletion of the VDR in the intestinal epithelium exacerbated intestinal fibrosis in mice administered with dextran sulfate sodium or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, two experimental colitis inducers. In addition, we found that vitamin D dietary intervention regulated intestinal fibrosis by modulating the intestinal expression of the VDR. Mechanistically, knocking down the VDR in both CCD-18Co cells and human primary colonic fibroblasts promoted fibroblast activation, whereas VDR overexpression or VDR agonist administration inhibited fibroblast activation. Further analysis illustrated that the VDR inhibited EMT in the HT29 cell model and that mitochondrial dysfunction mediated epithelial integrity and barrier function in VDR-deficient epithelial cells. Together, our data for the first time demonstrate that VDR activation alleviates intestinal fibrosis by inhibiting fibroblast activation and epithelial mitochondria-mediated EMT.",

Although growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF)-15 has great potential as a tumor marker, supporting clinical evidence is still lacking. In this study, we aimed to analyze the relationship between serum GDF15 concentration and the clinical characteristics of patients with lung cancer, and to assess the value of GDF15 in the diagnosis and curative effect of chemotherapy.",
