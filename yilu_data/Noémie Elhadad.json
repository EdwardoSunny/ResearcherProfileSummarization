        "Abstract": "Healthcare continues to grapple with the persistent issue of treatment disparities, sparking concerns regarding the equitable allocation of treatments in clinical practice. While various fairness metrics have emerged to assess fairness in decision-making processes, a growing focus has been on causality-based fairness concepts due to their capacity to mitigate confounding effects and reason about bias. However, the application of causal fairness notions in evaluating the fairness of clinical decision-making with electronic health record (EHR) data remains an understudied domain. This study aims to address the methodological gap in assessing causal fairness of treatment allocation with electronic health records data. In addition, we investigate the impact of social determinants of health on the assessment of causal fairness of treatment allocation.",

        "Abstract": "Two-step approaches, in which summary candidates are generated-then-reranked to return a single summary, can improve ROUGE scores over the standard single-step approach. Yet, standard decoding methods (i.e., beam search, nucleus sampling, and diverse beam search) produce candidates with redundant, and often low quality, content. In this paper, we design a novel method to generate candidates for re-ranking that addresses these issues. We ground each candidate abstract on its own unique content plan and generate distinct plan-guided abstracts using a model's top beam. More concretely, a standard language model (a BART LM) auto-regressively generates elemental discourse unit (EDU) content plans with an extractive copy mechanism. The top ",

        "Abstract": "Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) continue to pose a substantial public health challenge in the United States (US). Surveillance, a cornerstone of disease control and prevention, can be strengthened to promote more timely, efficient, and equitable practices by incorporating health information exchange (HIE) and other large-scale health data sources into reporting. New York City patient-level electronic health record data between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2023 were obtained from Healthix, the largest US public HIE. Healthix data were linked to neighborhood-level information from the American Community Survey. In this casecontrol study, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV-positive cases were compared to controls to estimate the odds of receiving a specific laboratory test or positive result using generalized estimating equations with logit function and robust standard errors. Among 1,519,121 tests performed for chlamydia, 1,574,772 for gonorrhea, and 1,200,560 for HIV, 2%, 0.6% and 0.3% were positive for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV, respectively. Chlamydia and gonorrhea co-occurred in 1,854 cases (7% of chlamydia and 21% of gonorrhea total cases). Testing behavior was often incongruent with geographic and sociodemographic patterns of positive cases. For example, people living in areas with the highest levels of poverty were less likely to test for gonorrhea but almost twice as likely to test positive compared to those in low poverty areas. Regional HIE enabled review of testing and cases using granular and complementary data not typically available given existing reporting practices. Enhanced surveillance spotlights potential incongruencies between testing patterns and STI risk in certain populations, signaling potential under- and over-testing. These and future insights derived from HIE data may be used to continuously inform public health practice and drive further improvements in provision and evaluation of services and programs.",

        "Abstract": "Complete and accurate race and ethnicity (RE) patient information is important for many areas of biomedical informatics research, such as defining and characterizing cohorts, performing quality assessments, and identifying health inequities. Patient-level RE data is often inaccurate or missing in structured sources, but can be supplemented through clinical notes and natural language processing (NLP). While NLP has made many improvements in recent years with large language models, bias remains an often-unaddressed concern, with research showing that harmful and negative language is more often used for certain racial/ethnic groups than others. We present an approach to audit the learned associations of models trained to identify RE information in clinical text by measuring the concordance between model-derived salient features and manually identified RE-related spans of text. We show that while models perform well on the surface, there exist concerning learned associations and potential for future harms from RE-identification models if left unaddressed.",

        "Abstract": "Studying near-miss errors is essential to preventing errors from reaching patients. When an error is committed, it may be intercepted (near-miss) or it will reach the patient; estimates of the proportion that reach the patient vary widely. To better understand this relationship, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using two objective measures to identify wrong-patient imaging order errors involving radiation, estimating the proportion of errors that are intercepted and those that reach the patient. This study was conducted at a large integrated healthcare system using data from 1 January to 31 December 2019. The study used two outcome measures of wrong-patient orders: (1) wrong-patient orders that led to misadministration of radiation reported to the New York Patient Occurrence Reporting and Tracking System (NYPORTS) (misadministration events); and (2) wrong-patient orders identified by the Wrong-Patient Retract-and-Reorder (RAR) measure, a measure identifying orders placed for a patient, retracted and rapidly reordered by the same clinician on a different patient (near-miss events). All imaging orders that involved radiation were extracted retrospectively from the healthcare system data warehouse. Among 293\u2009039 total eligible orders, 151 were wrong-patient orders (3 misadministration events, 148 near-miss events), for an overall rate of 51.5 per 100\u2009000 imaging orders involving radiation placed on the wrong patient. Of all wrong-patient imaging order errors, 2% reached the patient, translating to 50 near-miss events for every 1 error that reached the patient. This proportion provides a more accurate and reliable estimate and reinforces the utility of systematic measure of near-miss errors as an outcome for preventative interventions.",

Among 112 acute and chronic diseases, women experience longer lengths of time between symptom onset and disease diagnosis than men for most diseases regardless of metric used, even when only symptoms common to both genders are considered. These findings are consistent for patients with private as well as government insurance. Our analysis highlights systematic gender differences in patterns of disease diagnosis and suggests that symptoms of disease are measured or weighed differently for women and men.

        "Abstract": "Phenotyping is a core, routine activity in observational health research. Cohorts impact downstream analyses, such as how a condition is characterized, how patient risk is defined, and what treatments are studied. It is thus critical to ensure that cohorts are representative of all patients, independently of their demographics or social determinants of health. In this paper, we propose a set of best practices to assess the fairness of phenotype definitions. We leverage established fairness metrics commonly used in predictive models and relate them to commonly used epidemiological metrics. We describe an empirical study for Crohn's disease and diabetes type 2, each with multiple phenotype definitions taken from the literature across gender and race. We show that the different phenotype definitions exhibit widely varying and disparate performance according to the different fairness metrics and subgroups. We hope that the proposed best practices can help in constructing fair and inclusive phenotype definitions.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical documentation in electronic health records contains crucial narratives and details about patients and their care. Natural language processing (NLP) can unlock the information conveyed in clinical notes and reports, and thus plays a critical role in real-world studies. The NLP Working Group at the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) consortium was established to develop methods and tools to promote the use of textual data and NLP in real-world observational studies. In this paper, we describe a framework for representing and utilizing textual data in real-world evidence generation, including representations of information from clinical text in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), the workflow and tools that were developed to extract, transform and load (ETL) data from clinical notes into tables in OMOP CDM, as well as current applications and specific use cases of the proposed OHDSI NLP solution at large consortia and individual institutions with English textual data. Challenges faced and lessons learned during the process are also discussed to provide valuable insights for researchers who are planning to implement NLP solutions in real-world studies.",

        "Abstract": "Background Cardiometabolic diseases are highly comorbid, but their relationship with female-specific or overwhelmingly female-predominant health conditions (breast cancer, endometriosis, pregnancy complications) is understudied. This study aimed to estimate the cross-trait genetic overlap and influence of genetic burden of cardiometabolic traits on health conditions unique to women. Methods and Results Using electronic health record data from 71\u2009008 ancestrally diverse women, we examined relationships between 23 obstetrical/gynecological conditions and 4 cardiometabolic phenotypes (body mass index, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension) by performing 4 analyses: (1) cross-trait genetic correlation analyses to compare genetic architecture, (2) polygenic risk score-based association tests to characterize shared genetic effects on disease risk, (3) Mendelian randomization for significant associations to assess cross-trait causal relationships, and (4) chronology analyses to visualize the timeline of events unique to groups of women with high and low genetic burden for cardiometabolic traits and highlight the disease prevalence in risk groups by age. We observed 27 significant associations between cardiometabolic polygenic scores and obstetrical/gynecological conditions (body mass index and endometrial cancer, body mass index and polycystic ovarian syndrome, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes and polycystic ovarian syndrome). Mendelian randomization analysis provided additional evidence of independent causal effects. We also identified an inverse association between coronary artery disease and breast cancer. High cardiometabolic polygenic scores were associated with early development of polycystic ovarian syndrome and gestational hypertension. Conclusions We conclude that polygenic susceptibility to cardiometabolic traits is associated with elevated risk of certain female-specific health conditions.",

        "Abstract": "A normally functioning menstrual cycle requires significant crosstalk between hormones originating in ovarian and brain tissues. Reproductive hormone dysregulation may cause abnormal function and sometimes infertility. The inherent complexity in this endocrine system is a challenge to identifying mechanisms of cycle disruption, particularly given the large number of unknown parameters in existing mathematical models. We develop a new endocrine model to limit model complexity and use simulated distributions of unknown parameters for model analysis. By employing a comprehensive model evaluation, we identify a collection of mechanisms that differentiate normal and abnormal phenotypes. We also discover an intermediate phenotype-displaying relatively normal hormone levels and cycle dynamics-that is grouped statistically with the irregular phenotype. Results provide insight into how clinical symptoms associated with ovulatory disruption may not be detected through hormone measurements alone.",

However, chatbots in health are predominantly scripted or rule-based, which can result in a stagnant and repetitive user experience in contrast with more dynamic, data-driven chatbots in other domains. Consequently, little is known about the tradeoffs of pursuing data-driven approaches for health chatbots. We examined multiple artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to enable ",

        "Abstract": "Widespread use of at-home rapid COVID-19 antigen tests has been proposed as an important public health intervention to interrupt chains of transmission. Antigen tests may be preferred over PCR because they provide on-demand results for relatively low cost and can identify people when they are most likely to be infectious, particularly when used daily. Yet the extent to which a frequent antigen testing intervention will result in a positive public health impact for COVID-19 will depend on high acceptability and high adherence to such regimens.",

        "Abstract": "We explore how to quantify uncertainty when designing predictive models for healthcare to provide well-calibrated results. Uncertainty quantification and calibration are critical in medicine, as one must not only accommodate the variability of the underlying physiology, but adjust to the uncertain data collection and reporting process. This occurs not only on the context of electronic health records (i.e., the clinical documentation process), but on mobile health as well (i.e., user specific self-tracking patterns must be accounted for). In this work, we show that accurate uncertainty estimation is directly relevant to an important health application: the prediction of menstrual cycle length, based on self-tracked information. We take advantage of a flexible generative model that accommodates under-dispersed distributions via two degrees of freedom to fit the mean and variance of the observed cycle lengths. From a machine learning perspective, our work showcases how flexible generative models can not only provide state-of-the art predictive accuracy, but enable well-calibrated predictions. From a healthcare perspective, we demonstrate that with flexible generative models, not only can we accommodate the idiosyncrasies of mobile health data, but we can also adjust the predictive uncertainty to per-user cycle length patterns. We evaluate the proposed model in real-world cycle length data collected by one of the most popular menstrual trackers worldwide, and demonstrate how the proposed generative model provides accurate and well-calibrated cycle length predictions. Providing meaningful, less uncertain cycle length predictions is beneficial for menstrual health researchers, mobile health users and developers, as it may help design more usable mobile health solutions.",

Metadata can refer to granular context, such as section type, or to more global context, such as unique document ids. Reliance on metadata for contextualized representation learning is apropos in the clinical domain where text is semi-structured and expresses high variation in topics. We evaluate the LMC model on the task of zero-shot clinical acronym expansion across three datasets. The LMC significantly outperforms a diverse set of baselines at a fraction of the pre-training cost and learns clinically coherent representations. We demonstrate that not only is metadata itself very helpful for the task, but that the LMC inference algorithm provides an additional large benefit.",

Given the documentation authored throughout a patient's hospitalization, generate a paragraph that tells the story of the patient admission. We construct an English, text-to-text dataset of 109,000 hospitalizations (2M source notes) and their corresponding summary proxy: the clinician-authored \"Brief Hospital Course\" paragraph written as part of a discharge note. Exploratory analyses reveal that the BHC paragraphs are highly abstractive with some long extracted fragments; are concise yet comprehensive; differ in style and content organization from the source notes; exhibit minimal lexical cohesion; and represent silver-standard references. Our analysis identifies multiple implications for modeling this complex, multi-document summarization task.",

The clinical natural language processing field has made strides in overcoming domain heterogeneity, while pretrained deep learning models present opportunities to transfer knowledge from one task to another. Pretrained models have performed well when transferred to new tasks; however, it is not well understood if these models generalize across differences in institutions and settings within the clinical domain. We explore if institution or setting specific pretraining is necessary for pretrained models to perform well when transferred to new tasks. We find no significant performance difference between models pretrained across institutions and settings, indicating that clinically pretrained models transfer well across such boundaries. Given a clinically pretrained model, clinical natural language processing researchers may forgo the time-consuming pretraining step without a significant performance drop.",

        "Abstract": "In chronic conditions, patients and providers need support in understanding and managing illness over time. Focusing on endometriosis, an enigmatic chronic condition, we conducted interviews with specialists and focus groups with patients to elicit their work in care specifically pertaining to dealing with an enigmatic disease, both independently and in partnership, and how technology could support these efforts. We found that the work to care for the illness, including reflecting on the illness experience and planning for care, is significantly compounded by the complex nature of the disease: enigmatic condition means uncertainty and frustration in care and management; the multi-factorial and systemic features of endometriosis without any guidance to interpret them overwhelm patients and providers; the different temporal resolutions of this chronic condition confuse both patients and provides; and patients and providers negotiate medical knowledge and expertise in an attempt to align their perspectives. We note how this added complexity demands that patients and providers work together to find common ground and align perspectives, and propose three design opportunities (considerations to construct a holistic picture of the patient, design features to reflect and make sense of the illness, and opportunities and mechanisms to correct misalignments and plan for care) and implications to support patients and providers in their care work. Specifically, the enigmatic nature of endometriosis necessitates complementary approaches from human-centered computing and artificial intelligence, and thus opens a number of future research avenues.",

Many emergency departments (EDs) use emergency severity index (ESI) or abnormal vital sign triggers to guide triage. However, both use fixed thresholds, and false activations are costly.

        "Abstract": "Endometriosis is a systemic and chronic condition in women of childbearing age, yet a highly enigmatic disease with unresolved questions: there are no known biomarkers, nor established clinical stages. We here investigate the use of patient-generated health data and data-driven phenotyping to characterize endometriosis patient subtypes, based on their reported signs and symptoms. We aim at unsupervised learning of endometriosis phenotypes using self-tracking data from personal smartphones. We leverage data from an observational research study of over 4000 women with endometriosis that track their condition over more than 2 years. We extend a classical mixed-membership model to accommodate the idiosyncrasies of the data at hand, i.e., the multimodality and uncertainty of the self-tracked variables. The proposed method, by jointly modeling a wide range of observations (i.e., participant symptoms, quality of life, treatments), identifies clinically relevant endometriosis subtypes. Experiments show that our method is robust to different hyperparameter choices and the biases of self-tracking data (e.g., the wide variations in tracking frequency among participants). With this work, we show the promise of unsupervised learning of endometriosis subtypes from self-tracked data, as learned phenotypes align well with what is already known about the disease, but also suggest new clinically actionable findings.

        "Title": "Characterizing physiological and symptomatic variation in menstrual cycles using self-tracked mobile-health data.",
        "Abstract": "The menstrual cycle is a key indicator of overall health for women of reproductive age. Previously, menstruation was primarily studied through survey results; however, as menstrual tracking mobile apps become more widely adopted, they provide an increasingly large, content-rich source of menstrual health experiences and behaviors over time. By exploring a database of user-tracked observations from the Clue app by BioWink GmbH of over 378,000 users and 4.9 million natural cycles, we show that self-reported menstrual tracker data can reveal statistically significant relationships between per-person cycle length variability and self-reported qualitative symptoms. A concern for self-tracked data is that they reflect not only physiological behaviors, but also the engagement dynamics of app users. To mitigate such potential artifacts, we develop a procedure to exclude cycles lacking user engagement, thereby allowing us to better distinguish true menstrual patterns from tracking anomalies. We uncover that women located at different ends of the menstrual variability spectrum, based on the consistency of their cycle length statistics, exhibit statistically significant differences in their cycle characteristics and symptom tracking patterns. We also find that cycle and period length statistics are stationary over the app usage timeline across the variability spectrum. The symptoms that we identify as showing statistically significant association with timing data can be useful to clinicians and users for predicting cycle variability from symptoms, or as potential health indicators for conditions like endometriosis. Our findings showcase the potential of longitudinal, high-resolution self-tracked data to improve understanding of menstruation and women's health as a whole.",

        "Abstract": "Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) are environmental and behavioral factors that impede disease self-management and can exacerbate clinical conditions. While recent research in the informatics community has focused on building systems that can automatically infer SBDH from the patient record, it is unclear how such determinants change overtime. This study analyzes the longitudinal characteristics of 4 common SBDH as expressed in the patient record and compares the rates of change among distinct SBDH. In addition, manual review of patient notes was undertaken to establish whether changes in patient SBDH status reflected legitimate changes in patient status or rather potential data quality issues. Our findings suggest that a patient's SBDH status is liable to change over time and that some changes reflect poor social history taking by clinicians.",

        "Abstract": "Digital technologies such as smartphones are transforming the way scientists conduct biomedical research. Several remotely conducted studies have recruited thousands of participants over a span of a few months allowing researchers to collect real-world data at scale and at a fraction of the cost of traditional research. Unfortunately, remote studies have been hampered by substantial participant attrition, calling into question the representativeness of the collected data including generalizability of outcomes. We report the findings regarding recruitment and retention from eight remote digital health studies conducted between 2014-2019 that provided individual-level study-app usage data from more than 100,000 participants completing nearly 3.5 million remote health evaluations over cumulative participation of 850,000 days. Median participant retention across eight studies varied widely from 2-26 days (median across all studies\u2009=\u20095.5 days). Survival analysis revealed several factors significantly associated with increase in participant retention time, including (i) referral by a clinician to the study (increase of 40 days in median retention time); (ii) compensation for participation (increase of 22 days, 1 study); (iii) having the clinical condition of interest in the study (increase of 7 days compared with controls); and (iv) older age (increase of 4 days). Additionally, four distinct patterns of daily app usage behavior were identified by unsupervised clustering, which were also associated with participant demographics. Most studies were not able to recruit a sample that was representative of the race/ethnicity or geographical diversity of the US. Together these findings can help inform recruitment and retention strategies to enable equitable participation of populations in future digital health research.",

But collecting and analyzing data are complicated and often fraught processes, because data are political and subjective, decisions on what data we collect and what data we do not collect are not determined by accident. As a result, despite the significant potential of the current rise in attention to menstruation, we also see risks: a lack of a solid evidence base for program decisions and resulting sensationalization; concerns about data privacy; an overreliance on participants' recall, on the one hand, while not involving participants adequately in decision making, on the other hand; and a lack of contextualized and disaggregated data. Yet better communication, contextualization, and collaboration can address many of these risks.",

We describe ongoing research to extract SBDH related to sexual health from clinical documentation. Our work addresses several challenges. First, there is no standard set of SBDHs for sexual health; we describe our curation of 38 such SBDHs. Second, it is unknown how SBDH related to sexual health are expressed in clinical notes; we detail the characteristics of an annotated corpus. Third, SBDH documentations are rare; we describe the use of semi-supervised learning to accelerate the annotation process by identifying notes likely to document SBDH. Fourth, we describe preliminary results to infer an array of SBDH from clinical documentation using supervised learning.",

        "Abstract": "To develop and validate a prediction model for delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) using a temporal unsupervised feature engineering approach, demonstrating improved precision over standard features. 488 consecutive SAH admissions from 2006 to 2014 to a tertiary care hospital were included. Models were trained on 80%, while 20% were set aside for validation testing. Baseline information and standard grading scales were evaluated: age, sex, Hunt Hess grade, modified Fisher Scale (mFS), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). An unsupervised approach applying random kernels was used to extract features from physiological time series (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation). Classifiers (Partial Least Squares, linear and kernel Support Vector Machines) were trained on feature subsets of the derivation dataset. Models were applied to the validation dataset. The performances of the best classifiers on the validation dataset are reported by feature subset. Standard grading scale (mFS): AUC 0.58. Combined demographics and grading scales: AUC 0.60. Random kernel derived physiologic features: AUC 0.74. Combined baseline and physiologic features with redundant feature reduction: AUC 0.77. Current DCI prediction tools rely on admission imaging and are advantageously simple to employ. However, using an agnostic and computationally inexpensive learning approach for high-frequency physiologic time series data, we demonstrated that our models achieve higher classification accuracy.",

        "Abstract": "Patients discuss complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in online health communities. Sometimes, patients' conflicting opinions toward CAM-related issues trigger debates in the community. The objectives of this paper are to identify such debates, identify controversial CAM therapies in a popular online breast cancer community, as well as patients' stances towards them. To scale our analysis, we trained a set of classifiers. We first constructed a supervised classifier based on a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) stacked over a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect automatically CAM-related debates from a popular breast cancer forum. Members' stances in these debates were also identified by a CNN-based classifier. Finally, posts automatically flagged as debates by the classifier were analyzed to explore which specific CAM therapies trigger debates more often than others. Our methods are able to detect CAM debates with F score of 77%, and identify stances with F score of 70%. The debate classifier identified about 1/6 of all CAM-related posts as debate. About 60% of CAM-related debate posts represent the supportive stance toward CAM usage. Qualitative analysis shows that some specific therapies, such as Gerson therapy and usage of laetrile, trigger debates frequently among members of the breast cancer community. This study demonstrates that neural networks can effectively locate debates on usage and effectiveness of controversial CAM therapies, and can help make sense of patients' opinions on such issues under dispute. As to CAM for breast cancer, perceptions of their effectiveness vary among patients. Many of the specific therapies trigger debates frequently and are worth more exploration in future work.",

        "Abstract": "A large number of patients discuss treatments in online health communities (OHCs). One research question of interest to health researchers is whether treatments being discussed in OHCs are eventually used by community members in their real lives. In this paper, we rely on machine learning methods to automatically identify attributions of mentions of treatments from an online autism community. The context of our work is online autism communities, where parents exchange support for the care of their children with autism spectrum disorder. Our methods are able to distinguish discussions of treatments that are associated with patients, caregivers, and others, as well as identify whether a treatment is actually taken. We investigate treatments that are not just discussed but also used by patients according to two types of content analysis, cross-sectional and longitudinal. The treatments identified through our content analysis help create a catalogue of real-world treatments. This study results lay the foundation for future research to compare real-world drug usage with established clinical guidelines.",

In this paper, we provide a multi-class schema, an annotated dataset, and supervised classifiers based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and other models for the task of classifying discussion topics. We apply the CNN classifier to the most popular breast cancer online community, and carry out cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses to show topic distributions and topic dynamics throughout members' participation. Our experimental results suggest that CNN outperforms other classifiers in the task of topic classification and identify several patterns and trajectories. For example, although members discuss mainly disease-related topics, their interest may change through time and vary with their disease severities.",

        "Abstract": "Dropping-out, which refers to when an individual abandons an intervention, is common in Internet-based studies as well as in online health communities. Community facilitators and health researchers are interested in this phenomenon because it usually indicates dissatisfaction towards the community and/or its failure to deliver expected benefits. In this study, we propose a method to identify dropout members from a large public online breast cancer community. We then study quantitatively what longitudinal factors of participation are correlated with dropping-out. Our experimental results suggest that dropout members discuss diagnosis- and treatment-related topics more than other topics. Furthermore, in the time before withdrawing from the community, dropout members tend to initiate more discussions but do not receive adequate response from the other members. We also discuss implications of our results and challenges in dropout-member identification. This study contributes to further understanding community participation and opens up a number of future research questions.",

The specialists are responsible for reviewing hundreds of patient charts each month and reporting disease-specific quality metrics to a variety of online registries and databases. We qualitatively and quantitatively investigated whether HARVEST improved the process of quality metric abstraction. Study instruments included pre/post questionnaires and log analyses of the specialists' actions in the electronic health record (EHR). The specialists reported favorable impressions of HARVEST and suggested that it was most useful when abstracting metrics from patients with long hospitalizations and for metrics that were not consistently captured in a structured manner in the EHR. A statistically significant reduction in time spent per chart before and after use of HARVEST was observed for 50% of the specialists and 90% of the specialists continue to use HARVEST after the study period.",

Accurately capturing emotional expression in text grows in relevance as people continue to spend more time in an online environment. The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) is a commonly used program for the identification of many constructs, including emotional expression. In an earlier study (Bantum & Owen, 2009) LIWC was demonstrated to have good sensitivity yet poor positive predictive value. The goal of the current study was to create an automated machine learning technique to mimic manual coding. The sample included online support groups, cancer discussion boards, and transcripts from an expressive writing study, which resulted in 39,367 sentence-level coding decisions. In examining the entire sample the machine learning approach outperformed LIWC, in all categories outside of Sensitivity for negative emotion (LIWC Sensitivity = .85; Machine Learning Sensitivity = .41), although LIWC does not take into consideration prosocial emotion, such as affection, interest, and validation. LIWC performed significantly better than the machine learning approach when removing the prosocial emotions (",

        "Abstract": "Speculations represent uncertainty toward certain facts. In clinical texts, identifying speculations is a critical step of natural language processing (NLP). While it is a nontrivial task in many languages, detecting speculations in Chinese clinical notes can be particularly challenging because word segmentation may be necessary as an upstream operation. The objective of this paper is to construct a state-of-the-art speculation detection system for Chinese clinical notes and to investigate whether embedding features and word segmentations are worth exploiting toward this overall task. We propose a sequence labeling based system for speculation detection, which relies on features from bag of characters, bag of words, character embedding, and word embedding. We experiment on a novel dataset of 36,828 clinical notes with 5103 gold-standard speculation annotations on 2000 notes, and compare the systems in which word embeddings are calculated based on word segmentations given by general and by domain specific segmenters respectively. Our systems are able to reach performance as high as 92.2% measured by F score. We demonstrate that word segmentation is critical to produce high quality word embedding to facilitate downstream information extraction applications, and suggest that a domain dependent word segmenter can be vital to such a clinical NLP task in Chinese language.",

We tackle this challenge through the joint modeling of a large set of diseases and a large set of clinical observations. The observations are drawn directly from heterogeneous patient record data (notes, laboratory tests, medications, and diagnosis codes), and the diseases are modeled in an unsupervised fashion. We apply UPhenome to two qualitatively different mixtures of patients and diseases: records of extremely sick patients in the intensive care unit with constant monitoring, and records of outpatients regularly followed by care providers over multiple years. We demonstrate that the UPhenome model can learn from these different care settings, without any additional adaptation. Our experiments show that (i) the learned phenotypes combine the heterogeneous data types more coherently than baseline LDA-based phenotypes; (ii) they each represent single diseases rather than a mix of diseases more often than the baseline ones; and (iii) when applied to unseen patient records, they are correlated with the patients' ground-truth disorders. Code for training, inference, and quantitative evaluation is made available to the research community.",

        "Abstract": "Social, behavioral, and cultural factors are clearly linked to health and disease outcomes. The medical social history is a critical evaluation of these factors performed by healthcare providers with patients in both inpatient and outpatient care settings. Physicians learn the topics covered in the social history through education and practice, but the topics discussed and documented in real-world clinical narrative have not been described at scale. This study applies large-scale automated topic modeling techniques to discover common topics discussed in social histories, to compare those topics to the medical textbook representation of those histories, and to compare topics between clinical settings to illustrate differences of clinical context on narrative content. Language modeling techniques are used to consider the extent to which inpatient and outpatient social histories share in their language use. Our findings highlight the fact that clinical context and setting are distinguishing factors for social history documentation, as the language of the hospital wards is not the same as that of the ambulatory clinic. Moreover, providers receive little feedback on the quality of their documentation beyond that needed for billing processes. The findings in this study demonstrate a number of topics described in textbooks - schooling, religion, alternative health practices, stressors, for example - do not appear in social histories in either clinical setting.",

However, it remains unknown how comprehensible clinical trial eligibility criteria used for recruitment are to a lay audience. This study initially investigated this problem. Readability of eligibility criteria was assessed according to (i) shallow and lexical characteristics through the use of an established, generic readability metric; (ii) syntactic characteristics through natural language processing techniques; and (iii) health terminological characteristics through an automated comparison to technical and lay health texts. We further stratified clinical trials according to various study characteristics (e.g., source country or study type) to understand potential factors influencing readability. Mainly caused by frequent use of technical jargons, a college reading level was found to be necessary to understand eligibility criteria text, a level much higher than the average literacy level of the general American population. The use of technical jargons should be minimized to simplify eligibility criteria text.",

The analysis is based on the EHR data comprising almost two decades of clinical observations collected at New York-Presbyterian, a large hospital in New York City with one of the oldest electronic health records in the United States. Our survival analysis approach centers around Bayesian multiresolution hazard modeling, with an objective to capture the changing hazard of CKD over time, adjusted for patient clinical covariates and kidney-related laboratory tests. Special attention is paid to statistical issues common to all EHR data, such as cohort definition, missing data and censoring, variable selection, and potential for joint survival and longitudinal modeling, all of which are discussed alone and within the EHR CKD context.",

        "Abstract": "Using glucose time series data from a well measured population drawn from an electronic health record (EHR) repository, the variation in predictability of glucose values quantified by the time-delayed mutual information (TDMI) was explained using a mechanistic endocrine model and manual and automated review of written patient records. The results suggest that predictability of glucose varies with health state where the relationship (e.g., linear or inverse) depends on the source of the acuity. It was found that on a fine scale in parameter variation, the less insulin required to process glucose, a condition that correlates with good health, the more predictable glucose values were. Nevertheless, the most powerful effect on predictability in the EHR subpopulation was the presence or absence of variation in health state, specifically, in- and out-of-control glucose versus in-control glucose. Both of these results are clinically and scientifically relevant because the magnitude of glucose is the most commonly used indicator of health as opposed to glucose dynamics, thus providing for a connection between a mechanistic endocrine model and direct insight to human health via clinically collected data.",

        "Abstract": "Recent research focused on online health information seeking highlights a heavy reliance on general-purpose search engines. However, current general-purpose search interfaces do not necessarily provide adequate support for non-experts in identifying suitable sources of health information. Popular search engines have recently introduced search tools in their user interfaces for a range of topics. In this work, we explore how such tools can support non-expert, patient-centered health information search. Scoping the current work to medication-related search, we report on findings from a formative study focused on the design of patient-centered, medication-information search tools. Our study included qualitative interviews with patients, family members, and domain experts, as well as observations of their use of Remedy, a technology probe embodying a set of search tools. Post-operative cardiothoracic surgery patients and their visiting family members used the tools to find information about their hospital medications and were interviewed before and after their use. Domain experts conducted similar search tasks and provided qualitative feedback on their preferences and recommendations for designing these tools. Findings from our study suggest the importance of four valuation principles underlying our tools: credibility, readability, consumer perspective, and topical relevance.",

        "Title": "Identifying and mitigating biases in EHR laboratory tests.",
        "Abstract": "Electronic health record (EHR) data show promise for deriving new ways of modeling human disease states. Although EHR researchers often use numerical values of laboratory tests as features in disease models, a great deal of information is contained in the context within which a laboratory test is taken. For example, the same numerical value of a creatinine test has different interpretation for a chronic kidney disease patient and a patient with acute kidney injury. We study whether EHR research studies are subject to biased results and interpretations if laboratory measurements taken in different contexts are not explicitly separated. We show that the context of a laboratory test measurement can often be captured by the way the test is measured through time. We perform three tasks to study the properties of these temporal measurement patterns. In the first task, we confirm that laboratory test measurement patterns provide additional information to the stand-alone numerical value. The second task identifies three measurement pattern motifs across a set of 70 laboratory tests performed for over 14,000 patients. Of these, one motif exhibits properties that can lead to biased research results. In the third task, we demonstrate the potential for biased results on a specific example. We conduct an association study of lipase test values to acute pancreatitis. We observe a diluted signal when using only a lipase value threshold, whereas the full association is recovered when properly accounting for lipase measurements in different contexts (leveraging the lipase measurement patterns to separate the contexts). Aggregating EHR data without separating distinct laboratory test measurement patterns can intermix patients with different diseases, leading to the confounding of signals in large-scale EHR analyses. This paper presents a methodology for leveraging measurement frequency to identify and reduce laboratory test biases.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic health records are an increasingly important source of data for research, allowing for large-scale longitudinal studies on the same population that is being treated. Unlike in controlled studies, though, these data vary widely in quality, quantity, and structure. In order to know whether algorithms can accurately uncover new knowledge from these records, or whether findings can be extrapolated to new populations, they must be validated. One approach is to conduct the same study in multiple sites and compare results, but it is a challenge to determine whether differences are due to artifacts of the medical process, population differences, or failures of the methods used. In this paper we describe the results of replicating a data-driven experiment to infer possible causes of congestive heart failure and their timing using data from two medical systems and two patient populations. We focus on the difficulties faced in this type of work, lessons learned, and recommendations for future research.",

        "Abstract": "The clinical notes in a given patient record contain much redundancy, in large part due to clinicians' documentation habit of copying from previous notes in the record and pasting into a new note. Previous work has shown that this redundancy has a negative impact on the quality of text mining and topic modeling in particular. In this paper we describe a novel variant of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, Red-LDA, which takes into account the inherent redundancy of patient records when modeling content of clinical notes. To assess the value of Red-LDA, we experiment with three baselines and our novel redundancy-aware topic modeling method: given a large collection of patient records, (i) apply vanilla LDA to all documents in all input records; (ii) identify and remove all redundancy by chosing a single representative document for each record as input to LDA; (iii) identify and remove all redundant paragraphs in each record, leaving partial, non-redundant documents as input to LDA; and (iv) apply Red-LDA to all documents in all input records. Both quantitative evaluation carried out through log-likelihood on held-out data and topic coherence of produced topics and qualitative assessment of topics carried out by physicians show that Red-LDA produces superior models to all three baseline strategies. This research contributes to the emerging field of understanding the characteristics of the electronic health record and how to account for them in the framework of data mining. The code for the two redundancy-elimination baselines and Red-LDA is made publicly available to the community.",

Examining participation in a community and its impact on members' behaviors and attitudes is one of the key open research questions in the field of study of online health communities. In this paper, we focus on a large public breast cancer community and conduct sentiment analysis on all its posts. We investigate the impact of different factors on post sentiment, such as time since joining the community, posting activity, age of members, and cancer stage of members. We find that there is a significant increase in sentiment of posts through time, with different patterns of sentiment trends for initial posts in threads and reply posts. Factors each play a role; for instance stage-IV members form a particular sub-community with patterns of sentiment and usage distinct from others members.",

        "Abstract": "Online health communities play an increasingly prevalent role for patients and are the source of a growing body of research. A lexicon that represents the sublanguage of an online community is an important resource to enable analysis and tool development over this data source. This paper investigates a method to generate a lexicon representative of the language of members in a given community with respect to specific semantic types. We experiment with a breast cancer community and detect terms that belong to three semantic types: medications, symptoms and side effects, and emotions. We assess the ability of our automatically generated lexicons to detect new terms, and show that a data-driven approach captures the sublanguage of members in these communities, all the while increasing coverage of general-purpose terminologies. The code and the generated lexicons are made available to the research community.",

        "Abstract": "Named entity recognition is a crucial component of biomedical natural language processing, enabling information extraction and ultimately reasoning over and knowledge discovery from text. Much progress has been made in the design of rule-based and supervised tools, but they are often genre and task dependent. As such, adapting them to different genres of text or identifying new types of entities requires major effort in re-annotation or rule development. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to extracting named entities from biomedical text. We describe a stepwise solution to tackle the challenges of entity boundary detection and entity type classification without relying on any handcrafted rules, heuristics, or annotated data. A noun phrase chunker followed by a filter based on inverse document frequency extracts candidate entities from free text. Classification of candidate entities into categories of interest is carried out by leveraging principles from distributional semantics. Experiments show that our system, especially the entity classification step, yields competitive results on two popular biomedical datasets of clinical notes and biological literature, and outperforms a baseline dictionary match approach. Detailed error analysis provides a road map for future work.",

Twitter is a short-text message system developed 6 years ago, now with more than 100 million users generating over 300 million Tweets every day. Twitter may be used to gain real-world insights to promote healthy behaviors. The purposes of this paper are to describe a practical approach to analyzing Tweet contents and to illustrate an application of the approach to the topic of physical activity. The approach includes five steps: (1) selecting keywords to gather an initial set of Tweets to analyze; (2) importing data; (3) preparing data; (4) analyzing data (topic, sentiment, and ecologic context); and (5) interpreting data. The steps are implemented using tools that are publically available and free of charge and designed for use by researchers with limited programming skills. Content mining of Tweets can contribute to addressing challenges in health behavior research.",

        "Abstract": "The increasing availability of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data and specifically free-text patient notes presents opportunities for phenotype extraction. Text-mining methods in particular can help disease modeling by mapping named-entities mentions to terminologies and clustering semantically related terms. EHR corpora, however, exhibit specific statistical and linguistic characteristics when compared with corpora in the biomedical literature domain. We focus on copy-and-paste redundancy: clinicians typically copy and paste information from previous notes when documenting a current patient encounter. Thus, within a longitudinal patient record, one expects to observe heavy redundancy. In this paper, we ask three research questions: (i) How can redundancy be quantified in large-scale text corpora? (ii) Conventional wisdom is that larger corpora yield better results in text mining. But how does the observed EHR redundancy affect text mining? Does such redundancy introduce a bias that distorts learned models? Or does the redundancy introduce benefits by highlighting stable and important subsets of the corpus? (iii) How can one mitigate the impact of redundancy on text mining?",

        "Abstract": "Abbreviations are widely used in clinical documents and they are often ambiguous. Building a list of possible senses (also called sense inventory) for each ambiguous abbreviation is the first step to automatically identify correct meanings of abbreviations in given contexts. Clustering based methods have been used to detect senses of abbreviations from a clinical corpus [1]. However, rare senses remain challenging and existing algorithms are not good enough to detect them. In this study, we developed a new two-phase clustering algorithm called Tight Clustering for Rare Senses (TCRS) and applied it to sense generation of abbreviations in clinical text. Using manually annotated sense inventories from a set of 13 ambiguous clinical abbreviations, we evaluated and compared TCRS with the existing Expectation Maximization (EM) clustering algorithm for sense generation, at two different levels of annotation cost (10 vs. 20 instances for each abbreviation). Our results showed that the TCRS-based method could detect 85% senses on average; while the EM-based method found only 75% senses, when similar annotation effort (about 20 instances) was used. Further analysis demonstrated that the improvement by the TCRS method was mainly from additionally detected rare senses, thus indicating its usefulness for building more complete sense inventories of clinical abbreviations.",

        "Abstract": "An open research question when leveraging ontological knowledge is when to treat different concepts separately from each other and when to aggregate them. For instance, concepts for the terms \"paroxysmal cough\" and \"nocturnal cough\" might be aggregated in a kidney disease study, but should be left separate in a pneumonia study. Determining whether two concepts are similar enough to be aggregated can help build better datasets for data mining purposes and avoid signal dilution. Quantifying the similarity among concepts is a difficult task, however, in part because such similarity is context-dependent. We propose a comprehensive method, which computes a similarity score for a concept pair by combining data-driven and ontology-driven knowledge. We demonstrate our method on concepts from SNOMED-CT and on a corpus of clinical notes of patients with chronic kidney disease. By combining information from usage patterns in clinical notes and from ontological structure, the method can prune out concepts that are simply related from those which are semantically similar. When evaluated against a list of concept pairs annotated for similarity, our method reaches an AUC (area under the curve) of 92%.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic health records contain an abundance of valuable information that can be used to guide patient care. However, the large volume of information embodied in these records also renders access to relevant information a time-consuming and inefficient process. Our ultimate objective is to develop an automated summarizer that succinctly captures all relevant information in the patient record. In this paper, we present a cognitive study of 8 clinicians who were asked to create summaries based on data contained in the patients' electronic health record. The study characterized the primary sources of information that were prioritized by clinicians, the temporal strategies used to develop a summary and the cognitive operations used to guide the summarization process. Although we would not expect the automated summarizer to emulate human performance, we anticipate that this study will inform its development in instrumental ways.",

        "Abstract": "An important task performed during the analysis of health news coverage is the identification of news articles that are related to a specific health topic (e.g. obesity). This is often done using a combination of keyword searching and manual encoding of news content. Statistical language models and their evaluation metric, perplexity, may help to automate this task. A perplexity study of obesity news was performed to evaluate perplexity as a measure of the similarity of news corpora to obesity news content. The results of this study showed that perplexity increased as news coverage became more general relative to obesity news (obesity news approximately 187, general health news approximately 278, general news approximately 378, general news across multiple publishers approximately 382). This indicates that language model perplexity can measure the similarity news content to obesity news coverage, and could be used as the basis for an automated health news classifier.",

        "Abstract": "In the interest of designing an automated high-level, longitudinal clinical summary of a patient record, we analyze traditional ways in which medical problems pertaining to the patient are summarized in the electronic health record. The patient problem list has become a commonly used proxy for a summary of patient history and automated methods have been proposed to generate it. However, little research has been conducted on how to structure the problem list in a manner most effective for supporting clinical care. This study analyzes the structure and content of the Past Medical History (PMH) sections of a large corpus of clinical notes, as a proxy for problem lists. Findings show that when listing patients history, physicians convey several semantic types of information, not only problems. Furthermore, they often group related concepts in a single line of the PMH. In contrast, traditional problem lists allow only a simple enumeration of coded terms. Content analysis goes on to reiterate the value of more complex representations as well as provide valuable data and guidelines for automated generation of a clinical summary.",

In this work, we develop automated methods for acquisition and discovery of medical knowledge embedded in clinical narrative reports. MedLEE, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system, is applied to extract and encode clinical entities from narrative clinical reports obtained from New York-Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH), and associations between the clinical entities are determined based on statistical methods adjusted by volume tests. We focus on two types of entities, disease and symptom, in this study. Evaluation based on a random sample of disease-symptom associations indicates an overall recall of 90% and a precision of 92%. In conclusion, the preliminary study demonstrated that this method for knowledge acquisition of disease-symptom pairs from clinical reports is effective. The automated method is generalizable, and can be applied to detect other clinical associations, such as between diseases and medications.",

Our rule-based classifier using MedLEE semantic features is superior, with an F-measure of 0.83. Our supervised classifier trained with semantic MedLEE features is competitive with the top-performing smoking classifier in the i2b2 NLP Challenge, with microaveraged precision of 0.90, recall of 0.89, and F-measure of 0.89.",

        "Abstract": "We investigate how to improve access to medical literature for health consumers. Our focus is on medical terminology. We present a method to predict automatically in a given text which medical terms are unlikely to be understood by a lay reader. Our method, which is linguistically motivated and fully unsupervised, relies on how common a specific term is in texts that we already know are familiar to a lay reader. Once a term is identified as unfamiliar, an appropriate definition is mined from the Web to be provided to the reader. Our experiments show that the prediction and the addition of definitions significantly improve lay readers' comprehension of sentences containing technical medical terms.",

        "Title": "Facilitating physicians' access to information via tailored text summarization.",
        "Abstract": "We have developed a summarization system, TAS (Technical Article Summarizer), which, when provided with a patient record and journal articles returned by a search, automatically generates a summary that is tailored to the patient characteristics. We hypothesize that a personalized summary will allow a physician to more quickly find information relevant to patient care. In this paper, we present a user study in which subjects carried out a task under three different conditions: using search results only, using a generic summary and search results, and using a personalized summary with search results. Our study demonstrates that subjects do a better job on task completion with the personalized summary, and show a higher level of satisfaction, than under other conditions.",
