        "Abstract": "Recent computational studies have predicted many new ternary nitrides, revealing synthetic opportunities in this underexplored phase space. However, synthesizing new ternary nitrides is difficult, in part because intermediate and product phases often have high cohesive energies that inhibit diffusion. Here, we report the synthesis of two new phases, calcium zirconium nitride (CaZrN",

To capture increasingly complex phenomena, CRNs can be leveraged alongside data-driven methods and machine learning (ML).

Currently, there is limited theoretical guidance for identifying optimal solid-state synthesis procedures. We introduce two selectivity metrics, primary and secondary competition, to assess the favorability of target/impurity phase formation in solid-state reactions. We used these metrics to analyze 3520 solid-state reactions in the literature, ranking existing approaches to popular target materials. Additionally, we implemented these metrics in a data-driven synthesis planning workflow and demonstrated its application in the synthesis of barium titanate (BaTiO",

        "Abstract": "Reflex testing protocols allow clinical laboratories to perform second line diagnostic tests on existing specimens based on the results of initially ordered tests. Reflex testing can support optimal clinical laboratory test ordering and diagnosis. In current clinical practice, reflex testing typically relies on simple \"if-then\" rules; however, this limits the opportunities for reflex testing since most test ordering decisions involve more complexity than traditional rule-based approaches would allow. Here, using the analyte ferritin as an example, we propose an alternative machine learning-based approach to \"smart\" reflex testing.",

        "Abstract": "Reflex testing protocols allow clinical laboratories to perform second line diagnostic tests on existing specimens based on the results of initially ordered tests. Reflex testing can support optimal clinical laboratory test ordering and diagnosis. In current clinical practice, reflex testing typically relies on simple \"if-then\" rules; however, this limits their scope since most test ordering decisions involve more complexity than a simple rule will allow. Here, using the analyte ferritin as an example, we propose an alternative machine learning-based approach to \"smart\" reflex testing with a wider scope and greater impact than traditional rule-based approaches.",

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is characterized by extensive resistance to conventional therapies, making clinical management a challenge. Here we map the epigenetic dependencies of cancer stem cells, cells that preferentially evade therapy and drive progression, and identify SWI/SNF complex member SMARCD3 as a regulator of\u00a0pancreatic cancer cells. Although SWI/SNF subunits often act as tumor suppressors, we show that SMARCD3 is amplified in cancer, enriched in pancreatic cancer stem cells and upregulated in the human disease. Diverse genetic mouse models of pancreatic cancer and stage-specific Smarcd3 deletion reveal that Smarcd3 loss preferentially impacts established tumors, improving survival especially in context of chemotherapy. Mechanistically, SMARCD3 acts with FOXA1 to control lipid and fatty acid metabolism, programs associated with therapy resistance and poor prognosis in cancer. These data identify SMARCD3 as an epigenetic modulator responsible for establishing the metabolic landscape in aggressive pancreatic cancer cells and a potential target for new therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have increasingly achieved expert-level performance in medical imaging applications. However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in historically under-served populations such as female patients, Black patients, or patients of low socioeconomic status. Such biases are especially troubling in the context of underdiagnosis, whereby the AI algorithm would inaccurately label an individual with a disease as healthy, potentially delaying access to care. Here, we examine algorithmic underdiagnosis in chest X-ray pathology classification across three large chest X-ray datasets, as well as one multi-source dataset. We find that classifiers produced using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques consistently and selectively underdiagnosed under-served patient populations and that the underdiagnosis rate was higher for intersectional under-served subpopulations, for example, Hispanic female patients. Deployment of AI systems using medical imaging for disease diagnosis with such biases risks exacerbation of existing care biases and can potentially lead to unequal access to medical treatment, thereby raising ethical concerns for the use of these models in the clinic.",

The few known methods of designing selectivity in solid-state reactions have limited scope, such as topotactic reactions or strain stabilization. This contribution describes a general approach for searching large chemical spaces to identify selective reactions. This novel approach explains the ability of a nominally \"innocent\" Na",

Such corrections are commonly used to improve the accuracy of computational enthalpies of formation, phase stability predictions, and other energy-derived properties, for example. We incorporate this method into a new DFT energy correction scheme comprising a mixture of oxidation-state and composition-dependent corrections and show that many chemical systems contain unstable polymorphs that may actually be predicted stable when uncertainty is taken into account. We then illustrate how these uncertainties can be used to estimate the probability that a compound is stable on a compositional phase diagram, thus enabling better-informed assessments of compound stability.",

Many benchmark tasks have been proposed for molecular property prediction, but these tasks are generally aimed at specific, isolated biomedical properties. In this work, we propose a new cross-modal small molecule retrieval task, designed to force a model to learn to associate the structure of a small molecule with the transcriptional change it induces. We develop this task formally as multi-view alignment problem, and present a coordinated deep learning approach that jointly optimizes representations of both chemical structure and perturbational gene expression profiles. We benchmark our results against oracle models and principled baselines, and find that cell line variability markedly influences performance in this domain. Our work establishes the feasibility of this new task, elucidates the limitations of current data and systems, and may serve to catalyze future research in small molecule representation learning.",

        "Abstract": "Machine learning systems have received much attention recently for their ability to achieve expert-level performance on clinical tasks, particularly in medical imaging. Here, we examine the extent to which state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers trained to yield diagnostic labels from X-ray images are biased with respect to protected attributes. We train convolution neural networks to predict 14 diagnostic labels in 3 prominent public chest X-ray datasets: MIMIC-CXR, Chest-Xray8, CheXpert, as well as a multi-site aggregation of all those datasets. We evaluate the TPR disparity - the difference in true positive rates (TPR) - among different protected attributes such as patient sex, age, race, and insurance type as a proxy for socioeconomic status. We demonstrate that TPR disparities exist in the state-of-the-art classifiers in all datasets, for all clinical tasks, and all subgroups. A multi-source dataset corresponds to the smallest disparities, suggesting one way to reduce bias. We find that TPR disparities are not significantly correlated with a subgroup's proportional disease burden. As clinical models move from papers to products, we encourage clinical decision makers to carefully audit for algorithmic disparities prior to deployment.

        "Abstract": "Gene expression data can offer deep, physiological insights beyond the static coding of the genome alone. We believe that realizing this potential requires specialized, high-capacity machine learning methods capable of using underlying biological structure, but the development of such models is hampered by the lack of published benchmark tasks and well characterized baselines. In this work, we establish such benchmarks and baselines by profiling many classifiers against biologically motivated tasks on two curated views of a large, public gene expression dataset (the LINCS corpus) and one privately produced dataset. We provide these two curated views of the public LINCS dataset and our benchmark tasks to enable direct comparisons to future methodological work and help spur deep learning method development on this modality. In addition to profiling a battery of traditional classifiers, including linear models, random forests, decision trees, K nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers, and feed-forward artificial neural networks (FF-ANNs), we also test a method novel to this data modality: graph convolugtional neural networks (GCNNs), which allow us to incorporate prior biological domain knowledge. We find that GCNNs can be highly performant, with large datasets, whereas FF-ANNs consistently perform well. Non-neural classifiers are dominated by linear models and KNN classifiers.",

        "Abstract": "Research on neural interfaces has historically concentrated on development of systems for the brain; however, there is increasing interest in peripheral nerve interfaces (PNIs) that could provide benefit when peripheral nerve function is compromised, such as for amputees. Efforts focus on designing scalable and high-performance sensory and motor peripheral nervous system interfaces. Current PNIs face several design challenges such as undersampling of signals from the thousands of axons, nerve-fiber selectivity, and device-tissue integration. To improve PNIs, several researchers have turned to tissue engineering. Peripheral nerve tissue engineering has focused on designing regeneration scaffolds that mimic normal nerve extracellular matrix composition, provide advanced microarchitecture to stimulate cell migration, and have mechanical properties like the native nerve. By combining PNIs with tissue engineering, the goal is to promote natural axon regeneration into the devices to facilitate close contact with electrodes; in contrast, traditional PNIs rely on insertion or placement of electrodes into or around existing nerves, or do not utilize materials to actively facilitate axon regeneration. This review presents the state-of-the-art of PNIs and nerve tissue engineering, highlights recent approaches to combine neural-interface technology and tissue engineering, and addresses the remaining challenges with foreign-body response.",

        "Abstract": "Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is a frequently used polymer for neural implants due to its biocompatible property. As a follow-up to our recent study that used PEG for stiffening flexible neural probes, we have evaluated the biological implications of using devices dip-coated with PEG for chronic neural implants. Mice (wild-type and CX3CR1-GFP) received bilateral implants within the sensorimotor cortex, one hemisphere with a PEG-coated probe and the other with a non-coated probe for 4 weeks. Quantitative analyses were performed using biomarkers for activated microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, blood-brain barrier leakage, and neuronal nuclei to determine the degree of foreign body response (FBR) resulting from the implanted microelectrodes. Despite its well-known acute anti-biofouling property, we observed that PEG-coated devices caused no significantly different FBR compared to non-coated controls at 4 weeks. A repetition using CX3CR1-GFP mice cohort showed similar results. Our histological findings suggest that there is no significant impact of acute delivery of PEG on the FBR in the long-term, and that temporary increase in the device footprint due to the coating of PEG also does not have a significant impact. Large variability seen within the same treatment group also implies that avoiding large superficial vasculature during implantation is not sufficient to minimize inter-animal variability.",

        "Abstract": "Tetramethyl orthosilicate shows promise as a thin-film delivery vehicle for multi-electrode arrays for drug release and electrical performance; however, its effect upon device footprint has yet to be assessed. Using a previously established silicon wafer chip model, the thickness of one, two, and four protein doped coatings of sol-gel were analyzed via profilometry. Coating thickness was found to be 0.4\u03bcm, 1.1\u03bcm and 2.2\u03bcm on each side of the device. This addition to a native MEA is minimal when compared to other drug delivery paradigms currently associated with neural implants.",

        "Abstract": "Positioning of microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) incorporates biochemical and mechanical cues for proper alignment of the mitotic spindle and cell division site. Current experimental and theoretical studies in the early Caenorhabditis elegans embryo assume remarkable changes in the origin and polarity of forces acting on the MTOCs. These changes must occur over a few minutes, between initial centration and rotation of the pronuclear complex and entry into mitosis, and the models do not replicate in vivo timing of centration and rotation. Here we propose a model that incorporates asymmetry in the microtubule arrays generated by each MTOC, which we demonstrate with in vivo measurements, and a similar asymmetric force profile to that required for posterior-directed spindle displacement during mitosis. We find that these asymmetries are capable of and important for recapitulating the simultaneous centration and rotation of the pronuclear complex observed in vivo. The combination of theoretical and experimental evidence provided here offers a unified framework for the spatial organization and forces needed for pronuclear centration, rotation, and spindle displacement in the early C. elegans embryo.",

        "Abstract": "A significant proportion of enzymes display cooperativity in binding ligand molecules, and such effects have an important impact on metabolic regulation. This is easiest to understand in the case of positive cooperativity. Sharp responses to changes in metabolite concentrations can allow organisms to better respond to environmental changes and maintain metabolic homeostasis. However, despite the fact that negative cooperativity is almost as common as positive, it has been harder to imagine what advantages it provides. Here we use computational models to explore the utility of negative cooperativity in one particular context: that of an inhibitor binding to an enzyme. We identify several factors which may contribute, and show that acting together they can make negative cooperativity advantageous.",

        "Title": "A study of drug release from homogeneous PLGA microstructures.",
        "Abstract": "The hydrogel template method was used to fabricate homogeneous drug-PLGA microparticles. Four drugs (felodipine, risperidone, progesterone, and paclitaxel) were loaded into the PLGA particles with the homogeneous size of 10microm, 20microm, and 50microm. The drug loading into the PLGA microparticles was 50% and higher. The felodipine-PLGA microstructures of four different sizes showed that the drug release kinetics is dependent on the total surface area available for drug release. The smaller the particle size, the release rate was faster. Two types of microparticles (10microm diameter and 10microm height, and 50microm diameter and 5microm height) showed zero-order release and complete release was observed within 2weeks. The release rate, however, was not exactly proportional to the surface area. Different drugs which were loaded into the same PLGA formulation showed different release profiles. The main difference was on the initial burst release. The overall release profile seems to be similar for different drugs, if the release profile is adjusted to eliminate the burst release. The initial burst release appears to be inversely related to the water-solubility of a drug, i.e., the lower the water-solubility of a drug, the higher the burst release. The hydrogel template method allowed preparation of homogeneous particles with predefined sizes with high drug loading. It allowed study on the effect of size and shape on the drug release kinetics. With the microparticles of homogeneous size and shape, the drug release kinetics can be projected based on the size of microparticles and water-solubility of a drug. The ability of making homogeneous particles is expected to provide better prediction and reproducibility of the drug release property of a given formulation.",

        "Abstract": "Nano/microparticles have been used widely in drug delivery applications. The majority of the particles are prepared by the conventional emulsion methods, which tend to result in particles with heterogeneous size distribution with sub-optimal drug loading and release properties. Recently, microfabrication methods have been used to make nano/microparticles with a monodisperse size distribution. The existing methods utilize solid templates for making particles, and the collection of individual particles after preparation has not been easy. The new hydrogel template approach was developed to make the particle preparation process simple and fast. The hydrogel template approach is based on the unique properties of physical gels that can undergo sol-gel phase transition upon changes in environmental conditions. The phase reversible hydrogels, however, are in general mechanically too weak to be treated as a solid material. It was unexpectedly found that gelatin hydrogels could be made to possess various properties necessary for microfabrication of nano/microparticles in large quantities. The size of the particles can be adjusted from 200 nm to >50 microm, providing flexibility in controlling the size in drug delivery formulations. The simplicity in processing makes the hydrogel template method useful for scale-up manufacturing of particles. The drug loading capacity is 50% or higher, and yet the initial burst release is minimal. The hydrogel template approach presents a new strategy of preparing nano/microparticles of predefined size and shape with homogeneous size distribution for drug delivery applications.",

Here we report a low-temperature, environmentally benign, solution-based approach for the preparation of complex and oriented ZnO nanostructures, and the systematic modification of their crystal morphology. Using controlled seeded growth and citrate anions that selectively adsorb on ZnO basal planes as the structure-directing agent, we prepared large arrays of oriented ZnO nanorods with controlled aspect ratios, complex film morphologies made of oriented nanocolumns and nanoplates (remarkably similar to biomineral structures in red abalone shells) and complex bilayers showing in situ column-to-rod morphological transitions. The advantages of some of these ZnO structures for photocatalytic decompositions of volatile organic compounds were demonstrated. The novel ZnO nanostructures are expected to have great potential for sensing, catalysis, optical emission, piezoelectric transduction, and actuations.",

        "Abstract": "Although oriented carbon nanotubes, oriented nanowires of metals, semiconductors and oxides have attracted wide attention, there have been few reports on oriented polymer nanostructures such as nanowires. In this paper we report the assembly of large arrays of oriented nanowires containing molecularly aligned conducting polymers (polyaniline) without using a porous membrane template to support the polymer. The uniform oriented nanowires were prepared through controlled nucleation and growth during a stepwise electrochemical deposition process in which a large number of nuclei were first deposited on the substrate using a large current density. After the initial nucleation, the current density was reduced stepwise in order to grow the oriented nanowires from the nucleation sites created in the first step. The usefulness of these new polymer structures is demonstrated with a chemical sensor device for H(2)O(2), the detection of which is widely investigated for biosensors. Finally, we demonstrated that controlled nucleation and growth is a general approach and has potential for growing oriented nanostructures of other materials.",

        "Abstract": "Extended helical or chiral nanostructures are usually associated with biomolecules but are mostly absent in synthetic materials. Here we report the first synthesis of unusual oriented and extended helical nanostructures in synthetic ceramics. Large arrays of oriented helical ZnO nanorods and columns are formed using simple citrate ions to control the growth habits of the ZnO crystal. This novel mechanism could lead to new approaches to control the orientation, the surface area, and the defect structure of synthetic materials that are critical for practical applications. The morphology generated in the helical ZnO nanostructure shows remarkable resemblance to the growth morphology of nacreous calcium carbonate and thus may shed new light on morphology and orientation control of biominerals.",
