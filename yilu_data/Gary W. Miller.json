        "Title": "Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants upregulate VMAT2 activity and rescue disease-causing VMAT2 variants.",
        "Abstract": "Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is an essential transporter that regulates brain monoamine transmission and is important for mood, cognition, motor activity, and stress regulation. However, VMAT2 remains underexplored as a pharmacological target. In this study, we report that tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants acutely inhibit, but persistently upregulate VMAT2 activity by promoting VMAT2 protein maturation. Importantly, the VMAT2 upregulation effect was greater in BE(2)-M17 cells that endogenously express VMAT2 as compared to a heterologous expression system (HEK293). The net sustained effect of tricyclics and tetracyclics is an upregulation of VMAT2 activity, despite their acute inhibitory effect. Furthermore, imipramine and mianserin, two representative compounds, also demonstrated rescue of nine VMAT2 variants that cause Brain Monoamine Vesicular Transport Disease (BMVTD). VMAT2 upregulation could be beneficial for disorders associated with reduced monoamine transmission, including mood disorders and BMVTD, a rare but often fatal condition caused by a lack of functional VMAT2. Our findings provide the first evidence that small molecules can upregulate VMAT2 and have potential therapeutic benefit for various neuropsychiatric conditions.",

        "Title": "The Implementation Moonshot Project for Alternative Chemical Testing (IMPACT) toward a Human Exposome Project.",
        "Abstract": "The Human Exposome Project aims to revolutionize our understanding of how environmental exposures affect human health by systematically cataloging and analyzing the myriad exposures individuals encounter throughout their lives. This initiative draws a parallel with the Human Genome Project, expanding the focus from genetic factors to the dynamic and complex nature of environ-mental interactions. The project leverages advanced methodologies such as omics technologies, biomonitoring, microphysiological systems (MPS), and artificial intelligence (AI), forming the foun-dation of exposome intelligence (EI) to integrate and interpret vast datasets. Key objectives include identifying exposure-disease links, prioritizing hazardous chemicals, enhancing public health and regulatory policies, and reducing reliance on animal testing. The Implementation Moonshot Project for Alternative Chemical Testing (IMPACT), spearheaded by the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT), is a new element in this endeavor, driving the creation of a public-private part-nership toward a Human Exposome Project with a stakeholder forum in 2025. Establishing robust infrastructure, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, and ensuring quality assurance through sys-tematic reviews and evidence-based frameworks are crucial for the project's success. The expected outcomes promise transformative advancements in precision public health, disease prevention, and a more ethical approach to toxicology. This paper outlines the strategic imperatives, challenges, and opportunities that lie ahead, calling on stakeholders to support and participate in this landmark initiative for a healthier, more sustainable future.",

        "Abstract": "In the modern \"omics\" era, measurement of the human exposome is a critical missing link between genetic drivers and disease outcomes. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), routinely used in proteomics and metabolomics, has emerged as a leading technology to broadly profile chemical exposure agents and related biomolecules for accurate mass measurement, high sensitivity, rapid data acquisition, and increased resolution of chemical space. Non-targeted approaches are increasingly accessible, supporting a shift from conventional hypothesis-driven, quantitation-centric targeted analyses toward data-driven, hypothesis-generating chemical exposome-wide profiling. However, HRMS-based exposomics encounters unique challenges. New analytical and computational infrastructures are needed to expand the analysis coverage through streamlined, scalable, and harmonized workflows and data pipelines that permit longitudinal chemical exposome tracking, retrospective validation, and multi-omics integration for meaningful health-oriented inferences. In this article, we survey the literature on state-of-the-art HRMS-based technologies, review current analytical workflows and informatic pipelines, and provide an up-to-date reference on exposomic approaches for chemists, toxicologists, epidemiologists, care providers, and stakeholders in health sciences and medicine. We propose efforts to benchmark fit-for-purpose platforms for expanding coverage of chemical space, including gas/liquid chromatography-HRMS (GC-HRMS and LC-HRMS), and discuss opportunities, challenges, and strategies to advance the burgeoning field of the exposome.",

        "Abstract": "Environmental and genetic risk factors, and their interactions, contribute significantly to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Recent epidemiology studies have implicated pyrethroid pesticides as an environmental risk factor for autism and developmental delay. Our previous research showed that low-dose developmental exposure to the pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin in mice caused male-biased changes in the brain and in NDD-relevant behaviors in adulthood. Here, we used a metabolomics approach to determine the broadest possible set of metabolic changes in the adult male mouse brain caused by low-dose pyrethroid exposure during development. Using a litter-based design, we exposed mouse dams during pregnancy and lactation to deltamethrin (3\u202fmg/kg or vehicle every 3 days) at a concentration well below the EPA-determined benchmark dose used for regulatory guidance. We raised male offspring to adulthood and collected whole brain samples for untargeted high-resolution metabolomics analysis. Developmentally exposed mice had disruptions in 116 metabolites which clustered into pathways for folate biosynthesis, retinol metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism. As a cross-validation, we integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics data from the same samples, which confirmed previous findings of altered dopamine signaling. These results suggest that pyrethroid exposure during development leads to disruptions in metabolism in the adult brain, which may inform both prevention and therapeutic strategies.",

        "Title": "Neurotoxicology of dopamine: Victim or assailant?",
        "Abstract": "Since the identification of dopamine as a neurotransmitter in the mid-20th century, investigators have examined the regulation of dopamine homeostasis at a basic biological level and in human disorders. Genetic animal models that manipulate the expression of proteins involved in dopamine homeostasis have provided key insight into the consequences of dysregulated dopamine. As a result, we have come to understand the potential of dopamine to act as an endogenous neurotoxin through the generation of reactive oxygen species and reactive metabolites that can damage cellular macromolecules. Endogenous factors, such as genetic variation and subcellular processes, and exogenous factors, such as environmental exposures, have been identified as contributors to the dysregulation of dopamine homeostasis. Given the variety of dysregulating factors that impact dopamine homeostasis and the potential for dopamine itself to contribute to further cellular dysfunction, dopamine can be viewed as both the victim and an assailant of neurotoxicity. Parkinson's disease has emerged as the exemplar case study of dopamine dysregulation due to the genetic and environmental factors known to contribute to disease risk, and due to the evidence of dysregulated dopamine as a pathologic and pathogenic feature of the disease. This review, inspired by the talk, \"Dopamine in Durham: location, location, location\" presented by Dr. Miller for the Jacob Hooisma Memorial Lecture at the International Neurotoxicology Association meeting in 2023, offers a primer on dopamine toxicity covering endogenous and exogenous factors that disrupt dopamine homeostasis and the actions of dopamine as an endogenous neurotoxin.",

        "Title": "Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C enhances vesicular storage of dopamine and counters dopaminergic toxicity.",
        "Abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra exist in a persistent state of vulnerability resulting from high baseline oxidative stress, high-energy demand, and broad unmyelinated axonal arborisations. Impairments in the storage of dopamine compound this stress because of cytosolic reactions that transform the vital neurotransmitter into an endogenous neurotoxicant, and this toxicity is thought to contribute to the dopamine neuron degeneration that occurs Parkinson's disease. We have previously identified synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C (SV2C) as a modifier of vesicular dopamine function, demonstrating that genetic ablation of SV2C in mice results in decreased dopamine content and evoked dopamine release in the striatum. Here, we adapted a previously published in vitro assay utilising false fluorescent neurotransmitter 206 (FFN206) to visualise how SV2C regulates vesicular dopamine dynamics and determined that SV2C promotes the uptake and retention of FFN206 within vesicles. In addition, we present data indicating that SV2C enhances the retention of dopamine in the vesicular compartment with radiolabelled dopamine in vesicles isolated from immortalised cells and from mouse brain. Further, we demonstrate that SV2C enhances the ability of vesicles to store the neurotoxicant 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP",

        "Abstract": "Environmental and genetic risk factors, and their interactions, contribute significantly to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Recent epidemiology studies have implicated pyrethroid pesticides as an environmental risk factor for autism and developmental delay. Our previous research showed that low-dose developmental exposure to the pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin in mice caused male-biased changes in the brain and in NDD-relevant behaviors in adulthood. Here, we used a metabolomics approach to determine the broadest possible set of metabolic changes in the adult male mouse brain caused by low-dose pyrethroid exposure during development. Using a litter-based design, we exposed mouse dams during pregnancy and lactation to deltamethrin (3 mg/kg or vehicle every 3 days) at a concentration well below the EPA-determined benchmark dose used for regulatory guidance. We raised male offspring to adulthood and collected whole brain samples for untargeted high-resolution metabolomics analysis. Developmentally exposed mice had disruptions in 116 metabolites which clustered into pathways for folate biosynthesis, retinol metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism. As a cross-validation, we integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics data from the same samples, which confirmed previous findings of altered dopamine signaling. These results suggest that pyrethroid exposure during development leads to disruptions in metabolism in the adult brain, which may inform both prevention and therapeutic strategies.",

        "Title": "High-resolution mass spectrometry identifies delayed biomarkers for improved precision in acetaminophen/paracetamol human biomonitoring.",
        "Abstract": "Paracetamol/acetaminophen (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol, APAP) is a top selling analgesic used in more than 600 prescription and non-prescription pharmaceuticals. To study efficiently some of the potential undesirable effects associated with increasing APAP consumption (e.g., developmental disorders, drug-induced liver injury), there is a need to improve current APAP biomonitoring methods that are limited by APAP short half-life. Here, we demonstrate using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) in several human studies that APAP thiomethyl metabolite conjugates (S-methyl-3-thioacetaminophen sulfate and S-methyl-3-thioacetaminophen sulphoxide sulfate) are stable biomarkers with delayed excretion rates compared to conventional APAP metabolites, that could provide a more reliable history of APAP ingestion in epidemiological studies. We also show that these biomarkers could serve as relevant clinical markers to diagnose APAP acute intoxication in overdosed patients, when free APAP have nearly disappeared from blood. Using in vitro liver models (HepaRG cells and primary human hepatocytes), we then confirm that these thiomethyl metabolites are directly linked to the toxic N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) elimination, and produced via an overlooked pathway called the thiomethyl shunt pathway. Further studies will be needed to determine whether the production of the reactive hepatotoxic NAPQI metabolites is currently underestimated in human. Nevertheless, these biomarkers could already serve to improve APAP human biomonitoring, and investigate, for instance, inter-individual variability in NAPQI production to study underlying causes involved in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of exposomics-based HRMS approach to advance towards a better precision for human biomonitoring.",

        "Abstract": "Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is an essential transporter that regulates brain monoamine transmission and is important for mood, cognition, motor activity, and stress regulation. However, VMAT2 remains underexplored as a pharmacological target. In this study, we report that tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants acutely inhibit, but persistently upregulate VMAT2 activity by promoting VMAT2 protein maturation. Importantly, the VMAT2 upregulation effect was greater in BE(2)-M17 cells that endogenously express VMAT2 as compared to a heterologous expression system (HEK293). The net sustained effect of tricyclics and tetracyclics is an upregulation of VMAT2 activity, despite their acute inhibitory effect. Furthermore, imipramine and mianserin, two representative compounds, also demonstrated rescue of nine VMAT2 variants that cause Brain Vesicular Monoamine Transport Disease (BVMTD). VMAT2 upregulation could be beneficial for disorders associated with reduced monoamine transmission, including mood disorders and BVMTD, a rare but often fatal condition caused by a lack of functional VMAT2. Our findings provide the first evidence that small molecules can upregulate VMAT2 and have potential therapeutic benefit for various neuropsychiatric conditions.",

        "Title": "Developmental pyrethroid exposure disrupts molecular pathways for MAP kinase and circadian rhythms in mouse brain.",
        "Abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a category of pervasive disorders of the developing nervous system with few or no recognized biomarkers. A significant portion of the risk for NDDs, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is contributed by the environment, and exposure to pyrethroid pesticides during pregnancy has been identified as a potential risk factor for NDD in the unborn child. We recently showed that low-dose developmental exposure to the pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin in mice causes male-biased changes to ADHD- and NDD-relevant behaviors as well as the striatal dopamine system. Here, we used an integrated multiomics approach to determine the broadest possible set of biological changes in the mouse brain caused by developmental pyrethroid exposure (DPE). Using a litter-based, split-sample design, we exposed mouse dams during pregnancy and lactation to deltamethrin (3 mg/kg or vehicle every 3 days) at a concentration well below the EPA-determined benchmark dose used for regulatory guidance. We raised male offspring to adulthood, euthanized them, and pulverized and divided whole brain samples for split-sample transcriptomics, kinomics and multiomics integration. Transcriptome analysis revealed alterations to multiple canonical clock genes, and kinome analysis revealed changes in the activity of multiple kinases involved in synaptic plasticity, including the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK. Multiomics integration revealed a dysregulated protein-protein interaction network containing primary clusters for MAP kinase cascades, regulation of apoptosis, and synaptic function. These results demonstrate that DPE causes a multi-modal biophenotype in the brain relevant to ADHD and identifies new potential mechanisms of action.",

Impairments in the storage of dopamine compound this stress due to cytosolic reactions that transform the vital neurotransmitter into an endogenous neurotoxicant, and this toxicity is thought to contribute to the dopamine neuron degeneration that occurs Parkinson's disease. We have previously identified synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C (SV2C) as a modifier of vesicular dopamine function, demonstrating that genetic ablation of SV2C in mice results in decreased dopamine content and evoked dopamine release in the striatum.

        "Abstract": "The health and disease of an individual is mediated by their genetics, a lifetime of environmental exposures, and interactions between the two. Genetic or biological sex, including chromosome composition and hormone expression, may influence both the types and frequency of environmental exposures an individual experiences, as well as the biological responses an individual has to those exposures. Gender identity, which can be associated with social behaviors such as expressions of self, may also mediate the types and frequency of exposures an individual experiences. Recent advances in exposome-level analysis have progressed our understanding of how environmental factors affect health outcomes; however, the relationship between environmental exposures and sex- and gender-specific health remains underexplored. The comprehensive, non-targeted, and unbiased nature of exposomic research provides a unique opportunity to systematically evaluate how environmental exposures interact with biological sex and gender identity to influence health. In this forward-looking narrative review, we provide examples of how biological sex and gender identity influence environmental exposures, discuss how environmental factors may interact with biological processes, and highlight how an intersectional approach to exposomics can provide critical insights for sex- and gender-specific health sciences.",

        "Abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a widespread and growing public health challenge, affecting as many as 17% of children in the United States. Recent epidemiological studies have implicated ambient exposure to pyrethroid pesticides during pregnancy in the risk for NDDs in the unborn child. Using a litter-based, independent discovery-replication cohort design, we exposed mouse dams orally during pregnancy and lactation to the Environmental Protection Agency's reference pyrethroid, deltamethrin, at 3\u2005mg/kg, a concentration well below the benchmark dose used for regulatory guidance. The resulting offspring were tested using behavioral and molecular methods targeting behavioral phenotypes relevant to autism and NDD, as well as changes to the striatal dopamine system. Low-dose developmental exposure to the pyrethroid deltamethrin (DPE) decreased pup vocalizations, increased repetitive behaviors, and impaired both fear conditioning and operant conditioning. Compared with control mice, DPE mice had greater total striatal dopamine, dopamine metabolites, and stimulated dopamine release, but no difference in vesicular dopamine capacity or protein markers of dopamine vesicles. Dopamine transporter protein levels were increased in DPE mice, but not temporal dopamine reuptake. Striatal medium spiny neurons showed changes in electrophysiological properties consistent with a compensatory decrease in neuronal excitability. Combined with previous findings, these results implicate DPE as a direct cause of an NDD-relevant behavioral phenotype and striatal dopamine dysfunction in mice and implicate the cytosolic compartment as the location of excess striatal dopamine.",

        "Abstract": "Since the initial development of the exposome concept, much effort has been devoted to the characterisation of the exposome through analytical, epidemiological, and toxicological/mechanistic studies. There is now an urgent need to link the exposome to human diseases and to include exposomics in the characterisation of environment-linked pathologies together with genomics and other omics. Liver diseases are particularly well suited for such studies since major functions of the liver include the detection, detoxification, and elimination of xenobiotics, as well as inflammatory responses. It is well known that several liver diseases are associated with i) addictive behaviours such as alcohol consumption, smoking, and to a certain extent dietary imbalance and obesity, ii) viral and parasitic infections, and iii) exposure to toxins and occupational chemicals. Recent studies indicate that environmental exposures are also significantly associated with liver diseases, and these include air pollution (particulate matter and volatile chemicals), contaminants such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, bisphenol A and per-and poly-fluorinated substances, and physical stressors such as radiation. Furthermore, microbial metabolites and the \"gut-liver\" axis play a major role in liver diseases. Exposomics is poised to play a major role in the field of liver pathology. Methodological advances such as the exposomics-metabolomics framework, the determination of risk factors' genomic and epigenomic signatures, and cross-species biological pathway analysis should further delineate the impact of the exposome on the liver, opening the way for improved prevention, as well as the identification of new biomarkers of exposure and effects, and additional therapeutic targets.",

        "Abstract": "Omics-based technologies have enabled comprehensive characterization of our exposure to environmental chemicals (chemical exposome) as well as assessment of the corresponding biological responses at the molecular level (eg, metabolome, lipidome, proteome, and genome). By systematically measuring personal exposures and linking these stimuli to biological perturbations, researchers can determine specific chemical exposures of concern, identify mechanisms and biomarkers of toxicity, and design interventions to reduce exposures. However, further advancement of metabolomics and exposomics approaches is limited by a lack of standardization and approaches for assigning confidence to chemical annotations. While a wealth of chemical data is generated by gas chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS), incorporating GC-HRMS data into an annotation framework and communicating confidence in these assignments is challenging. It is essential to be able to compare chemical data for exposomics studies across platforms to build upon prior knowledge and advance the technology. Here, we discuss the major pieces of evidence provided by common GC-HRMS workflows, including retention time and retention index, electron ionization, positive chemical ionization, electron capture negative ionization, and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization spectral matching, molecular ion, accurate mass, isotopic patterns, database occurrence, and occurrence in blanks. We then provide a qualitative framework for incorporating these various lines of evidence for communicating confidence in GC-HRMS data by adapting the Schymanski scoring schema developed for reporting confidence levels by liquid chromatography HRMS (LC-HRMS). Validation of our framework is presented using standards spiked in plasma, and confident annotations in outdoor and indoor air samples, showing a false-positive rate of 12% for suspect screening for chemical identifications assigned as Level 2 (when structurally similar isomers are not considered false positives). This framework is easily adaptable to various workflows and provides a concise means to communicate confidence in annotations. Further validation, refinements, and adoption of this framework will ideally lead to harmonization across the field, helping to improve the quality and interpretability of compound annotations obtained in GC-HRMS.",

        "Abstract": "Precision medicine and exposomics require methods to assess xenobiotic metabolism in human metabolomic analyses, including the identification of known and undocumented drug and chemical exposures as well as their metabolites. Recent work demonstrated the use of high-throughput generation of xenobiotic metabolites with human liver S-9 fractions for their detection in human plasma and urine. Here, we tested whether a panel of lentivirally transduced human hepatoma cell lines (Huh7) that express individual cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes could be used to generate P450-specific metabolites in a high-throughput manner, while simultaneously identifying the enzymes responsible. Cell-line activities were verified using P450-specific probe substrates. To increase analytical throughput, we used a pooling strategy where 36 chemicals were grouped into 12 unique mixtures, each mixture containing 6 randomly selected compounds, and each compound being present in two separate mixtures. Each mixture was incubated with 8 different P450 cell lines for 0 and 2 hours and extracts were analyzed using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. Cell lines selectively metabolized test substrates, e.g., pazopanib, bupropion, and ",

        "Abstract": "The exposome concept encourages holistic consideration of the non-genetic factors (environmental exposures including lifestyle) that influence an individual's health over their life course. However, disconnect between the concept and practical application has promoted divergent interpretations of the exposome across disciplines and reinforced separation of the environmental (emphasizing exposures) and biological (emphasizing responses) research communities. In particular, while knowledge of biological responses can help to distinguish actual (i.e. experienced) from potential exposures, the inclusion of endogenous processes has generated confusion about the position of the exposome in a multi-omics systems biology context. We propose a reattribution of \"exposome\" to exclusively represent the totality of contact with external factors that a biological entity experiences, and introduce the term \"functional exposomics\" to denote the systematic study of exposure-phenotype interaction. This reoriented definition of the exposome allows a more readily integrable dataset for multi-omics and systems biology research.",

        "Abstract": "The exposome, the environmental complement of the genome, is an omics level characterization of an individual's exposures. There is growing interest in uncovering the role of the environment in human health using an exposomic framework that provides a systematic and unbiased analysis of the non-genetic drivers of health and disease. Many environmental toxicants are associated with molecular hallmarks of aging. An exposomic framework has potential to advance understanding of these associations and how modifications to the environment can promote healthy aging in the population. However, few studies have used this framework to study biological aging. We provide an overview of approaches and challenges in using an exposomic framework to investigate environmental drivers of aging. While capturing exposures over a life course is a daunting and expensive task, the use of historical data can be a practical way to approach this research.",

        "Title": "Integrating Environment and Aging Research: Opportunities for Synergy and Acceleration.",
        "Abstract": "Despite significant overlaps in mission, the fields of environmental health sciences and aging biology are just beginning to intersect. It is increasingly clear that genetics alone does not predict an individual's neurological aging and sensitivity to disease. Accordingly, aging neuroscience is a growing area of mutual interest within environmental health sciences. The impetus for this review came from a workshop hosted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in June of 2020, which focused on integrating the science of aging and environmental health research. It is critical to bridge disciplines with multidisciplinary collaborations across toxicology, comparative biology, epidemiology to understand the impacts of environmental toxicant exposures and age-related outcomes. This scoping review aims to highlight overlaps and gaps in existing knowledge and identify essential research initiatives. It begins with an overview of aging biology and biomarkers, followed by examples of synergy with environmental health sciences. New areas for synergistic research and policy development are also discussed. Technological advances including next-generation sequencing and other-omics tools now offer new opportunities, including exposomic research, to integrate aging biomarkers into environmental health assessments and bridge disciplinary gaps. This is necessary to advance a more complete mechanistic understanding of how life-time exposures to toxicants and other physical and social stressors alter biological aging. New cumulative risk frameworks in environmental health sciences acknowledge that exposures and other external stressors can accumulate across the life course and the advancement of new biomarkers of exposure and response grounded in aging biology can support increased understanding of population vulnerability. Identifying the role of environmental stressors, broadly defined, on aging biology and neuroscience can similarly advance opportunities for intervention and translational research. Several areas of growing research interest include expanding exposomics and use of multi-omics, the microbiome as a mediator of environmental stressors, toxicant mixtures and neurobiology, and the role of structural and historical marginalization and racism in shaping persistent disparities in population aging and outcomes. Integrated foundational and translational aging biology research in environmental health sciences is needed to improve policy, reduce disparities, and enhance the quality of life for older individuals.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disorder in which multiple cell types, including dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons, are affected. The mechanisms of neurodegeneration in PD are not fully understood, limiting the development of therapies directed at disease-relevant molecular targets. C. elegans is a genetically tractable model system that can be used to disentangle disease mechanisms in complex diseases such as PD. Such mechanisms can be studied combining high-throughput molecular profiling technologies such as transcriptomics and metabolomics. However, the integrative analysis of multi-omics data in order to unravel disease mechanisms is a challenging task without advanced bioinformatics training. Galaxy, a widely-used resource for enabling bioinformatics analysis by the broad scientific community, has poor representation of multi-omics integration pipelines. We present the integrative analysis of gene expression and metabolite levels of a C. elegans PD model using GAIT-GM, a new Galaxy tool for multi-omics data analysis. Using GAIT-GM, we discovered an association between branched-chain amino acid metabolism and cholinergic neurons in the C. elegans PD model. An independent follow-up experiment uncovered cholinergic neurodegeneration in the C. elegans model that is consistent with cholinergic cell loss observed in PD. GAIT-GM is an easy to use Galaxy-based tool for generating novel testable hypotheses of disease mechanisms involving gene-metabolite relationships.",

        "Abstract": "The development of the exposome concept has been one of the hallmarks of environmental and health research for the last decade. The exposome encompasses the life course environmental exposures including lifestyle factors from the prenatal period onwards. It has inspired many research programs and is expected to influence environmental and health research, practices, and policies. Yet, the links bridging toxicology and the exposome concept have not been well developed. In this review, we describe how the exposome framework can interface with and influence the field of toxicology, as well as how the field of toxicology can help advance the exposome field by providing the needed mechanistic understanding of the exposome impacts on health. Indeed, exposome-informed toxicology is expected to emphasize several orientations including (1) developing approaches integrating multiple stressors, in particular chemical mixtures, as well as the interaction of chemicals with other stressors, (2) using mechanistic frameworks such as the adverse outcome pathways to link the different stressors with toxicity outcomes, (3) characterizing the mechanistic basis of long-term effects by distinguishing different patterns of exposures and further exploring the environment-DNA interface through genetic and epigenetic studies, and (4) improving the links between environmental and human health, in particular through a stronger connection between alterations in our ecosystems and human toxicology. The exposome concept provides the linkage between the complex environment and contemporary mechanistic toxicology. What toxicology can bring to exposome characterization is a needed framework for mechanistic understanding and regulatory outcomes in risk assessment.",

        "Title": "High-Resolution Exposomics and Metabolomics Reveals Specific Associations in Cholestatic Liver Diseases.",
        "Abstract": "Progress in development of prognostic and therapeutic options for the rare cholestatic liver diseases, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), is hampered by limited knowledge of their pathogeneses. In particular, the potential role of hepatotoxic and/or metabolism-altering environmental chemicals in the pathogenesis of these diseases remains relatively unstudied. Moreover, the extent to which metabolic pathways are altered due to ongoing cholestasis and subsequent liver damage or possibly influenced by hepatotoxic chemicals is poorly understood. In this study, we applied a comprehensive exposomics-metabolomics approach to uncover potential pathogenic contributors to PSC and PBC. We used untargeted high-resolution mass spectrometry to characterize a wide range of exogenous chemicals and endogenous metabolites in plasma and tested them for association with disease. Exposome-wide association studies (EWAS) identified environmental chemicals, including pesticides, additives and persistent pollutants, that were associated with PSC and/or PBC, suggesting potential roles for these compounds in disease pathogenesis. Metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) found disease-associated alterations to amino acid, eicosanoid, lipid, co-factor, nucleotide, mitochondrial and microbial metabolic pathways, many of which were shared between PSC and PBC. Notably, this analysis implicates a potential role of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Finally, EWAS \u00d7 MWAS network analysis uncovered linkages between environmental agents and disrupted metabolic pathways that provide insight into potential mechanisms for PSC and PBC. Conclusion: This study establishes combined exposomics-metabolomics as a generalizable approach to identify potentially pathogenic environmental agents and enumerate metabolic alterations that may impact PSC and PBC, providing a foundation for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

The disease, or more appropriately diseases, have multiple environmental and genetic influences but no approved disease modifying therapy. Additionally, efforts to prevent this debilitating disease have been limited. As numerous environmental contaminants (e.g., pesticides, metals, industrial chemicals) are implicated in PD, disease prevention is possible. To reduce the burden of PD, we have compiled preclinical and clinical research priorities that highlight both disease prediction and primary prevention. Though not exhaustive, the \"PD prevention agenda\" builds upon many years of research by our colleagues and proposes next steps through the lens of modifiable risk factors. The agenda identifies ten specific areas of further inquiry and considers the funding and policy changes that will be necessary to help prevent the world's fastest growing brain disease.",

        "Abstract": "Complementing the genome with an understanding of the human exposome is an important challenge for contemporary science and technology. Tens of thousands of chemicals are used in commerce, yet cost for targeted environmental chemical analysis limits surveillance to a few hundred known hazards. To overcome limitations which prevent scaling to thousands of chemicals, we develop a single-step express liquid extraction and gas chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis to operationalize the human exposome. We show that the workflow supports quantification of environmental chemicals in human plasma (200\u2009\u00b5L) and tissue (\u2264100\u2009mg) samples. The method also provides high resolution, sensitivity and selectivity for exposome epidemiology of mass spectral features without a priori knowledge of chemical identity. The simplicity of the method can facilitate harmonization of environmental biomonitoring between laboratories and enable population level human exposome research with limited sample volume.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in genomics have revealed many of the genetic underpinnings of human disease, but exposomics methods are currently inadequate to obtain a similar level of understanding of environmental contributions to human disease. Exposomics methods are limited by low abundance of xenobiotic metabolites and lack of authentic standards, which precludes identification using solely mass spectrometry-based criteria. Here, we develop and validate a method for enzymatic generation of xenobiotic metabolites for use with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for chemical identification. Generated xenobiotic metabolites were used to confirm identities of respective metabolites in mice and human samples based upon accurate mass, retention time and co-occurrence with related xenobiotic metabolites. The results establish a generally applicable enzyme-based identification (EBI) for mass spectrometry identification of xenobiotic metabolites and could complement existing criteria for chemical identification.",

        "Abstract": "The holistic characterisation of the human internal chemical exposome using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) would be a step forward to investigate the environmental \u00e6tiology of chronic diseases with an unprecedented precision. HRMS-based methods are currently operational to reproducibly profile thousands of endogenous metabolites as well as externally-derived chemicals and their biotransformation products in a large number of biological samples from human cohorts. These approaches provide a solid ground for the discovery of unrecognised biomarkers of exposure and metabolic effects associated with many chronic diseases. Nevertheless, some limitations remain and have to be overcome so that chemical exposomics can provide unbiased detection of chemical exposures affecting disease susceptibility in epidemiological studies. Some of these limitations include (i) the lack of versatility of analytical techniques to capture the wide diversity of chemicals; (ii) the lack of analytical sensitivity that prevents the detection of exogenous (and endogenous) chemicals occurring at (ultra) trace levels from restricted sample amounts, and (iii) the lack of automation of the annotation/identification process. In this article, we discuss a number of technological and methodological limitations hindering applications of HRMS-based methods and propose initial steps to push towards a more comprehensive characterisation of the internal chemical exposome. We also discuss other challenges including the need for harmonisation and the difficulty inherent in assessing the dynamic nature of the internal chemical exposome, as well as the need for establishing a strong international collaboration, high level networking, and sustainable research infrastructure. A great amount of research, technological development and innovative bio-informatics tools are still needed to profile and characterise the \"invisible\" (not profiled), \"hidden\" (not detected) and \"dark\" (not annotated) components of the internal chemical exposome and concerted efforts across numerous research fields are paramount.",

        "Abstract": "In Parkinson's disease, dopamine-containing nigrostriatal neurons undergo profound degeneration. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis. TH increases in vitro formation of reactive oxygen species, and previous animal studies have reported links between cytosolic dopamine build-up and oxidative stress. To examine effects of increased TH activity in catecholaminergic neurons in vivo, we generated TH-over-expressing mice (TH-HI) using a BAC-transgenic approach that results in over-expression of TH with endogenous patterns of expression. The transgenic mice were characterized by western blot, qPCR, and immunohistochemistry. Tissue contents of dopamine, its metabolites, and markers of oxidative stress were evaluated. TH-HI mice had a 3-fold increase in total and phosphorylated TH levels and an increased rate of dopamine synthesis. Coincident with elevated dopamine turnover, TH-HI mice showed increased striatal production of H",

        "Abstract": "Dysfunction of the central noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems is the primary neurobiological characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD). Importantly, neuronal loss in the locus coeruleus (LC) that occurs in early stages of PD may accelerate progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, restoring the activity and function of the deficient noradrenergic system may be an important therapeutic strategy for early PD. In the present study, the lentiviral constructions of transcription factors Phox2a/2b, Hand2 and Gata3, either alone or in combination, were microinjected into the LC region of the PD model VMAT2 Lo mice at 12 and 18\u2009month age. Biochemical analysis showed that microinjection of lentiviral expression cassettes into the LC significantly increased mRNA levels of Phox2a, and Phox2b, which were accompanied by parallel increases of mRNA and proteins of dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the LC. Furthermore, there was considerable enhancement of DBH protein levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, as well as enhanced TH protein levels in the striatum and substantia nigra. Moreover, these manipulations profoundly increased norepinephrine and dopamine concentrations in the striatum, which was followed by a remarkable improvement of the spatial memory and locomotor behavior. These results reveal that over-expression of these transcription factors in the LC improves noradrenergic and dopaminergic activities and functions in this rodent model of PD. It provides the necessary groundwork for the development of gene therapies of PD, and expands our understanding of the link between the LC-norepinephrine and dopamine systems during the progression of PD.",

        "Abstract": "ApoE4 enhances Tau neurotoxicity and promotes the early onset of AD. Pretangle Tau in the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) is the earliest detectable AD-like pathology in the human brain. However, a direct relationship between ApoE4 and Tau in the LC has not been identified. Here we show that ApoE4 selectively binds to the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) and inhibits neurotransmitter uptake. The exclusion of norepinephrine (NE) from synaptic vesicles leads to its oxidation into the toxic metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl glycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL), which subsequently activates cleavage of Tau at N368 by asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) and triggers LC neurodegeneration. Our data reveal that ApoE4 boosts Tau neurotoxicity via VMAT2 inhibition, reduces hippocampal volume, and induces cognitive dysfunction in an AEP- and Tau N368-dependent manner, while conversely ApoE3 binds Tau and protects it from cleavage. Thus, ApoE4 exacerbates Tau neurotoxicity by increasing VMAT2 vesicle leakage and facilitating AEP-mediated Tau proteolytic cleavage in the LC via DOPEGAL.",

        "Abstract": "The proper storage and release of monoamines contributes to a wide range of neuronal activity. Here, we examine the effects of altered vesicular monoamine transport in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The gene cat-1 is responsible for the encoding of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) in C. elegans and is analogous to the mammalian vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). Our laboratory has previously shown that reduced VMAT2 activity confers vulnerability on catecholamine neurons in mice. The purpose of this article was to determine whether this function is conserved and to determine the impact of reduced VMAT activity in C. elegans. Here we show that deletion of cat-1/VMAT increases sensitivity to the neurotoxicant 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) as measured by enhanced degeneration of dopamine neurons. Reduced cat-1/VMAT also induces changes in dopamine-mediated behaviors. High-resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics in the whole organism reveals changes in amino acid metabolism, including tyrosine metabolism in the cat-1/VMAT mutants. Treatment with MPP+ disrupted tryptophan metabolism. Both conditions altered glycerophospholipid metabolism, suggesting a convergent pathway of neuronal dysfunction. Our results demonstrate the evolutionarily conserved nature of monoamine function in C. elegans and further suggest that high-resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics can be used in this model to study environmental and genetic contributors to complex human disease.",

        "Abstract": "Impairments in the vesicular packaging of dopamine result in an accumulation of dopamine in the cytosol. Cytosolic dopamine is vulnerable to two metabolic processes-enzymatic catabolism and enzymatic- or auto-oxidation-that form toxic metabolites and generate reactive oxygen species. Alterations in the expression or activity of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), which transports monoamines such as dopamine from the cytosol into the synaptic vesicle, result in dysregulated dopamine packaging. Here, we developed a series of assays using the fluorescent false neurotransmitter 206 (FFN206) to visualize VMAT2-mediated vesicular packaging at baseline and following pharmacological and toxicological manipulations. As a proof of principle, we observed a significant reduction in vesicular FFN206 packaging after treatment with the VMAT2 inhibitors reserpine (IC",

        "Abstract": "Tissue interstitial fluid (ISF) surrounds cells and is an underutilized source of biomarkers that complements conventional sources such as blood and urine. However, ISF has received limited attention due largely to lack of simple collection methods. Here, we developed a minimally invasive, microneedle-based method to sample ISF from human skin that was well tolerated by participants. Using a microneedle patch to create an array of micropores in skin coupled with mild suction, we sampled ISF from 21 human participants and identified clinically relevant and sometimes distinct biomarkers in ISF when compared to companion plasma samples based on mass spectrometry analysis. Many biomarkers used in research and current clinical practice were common to ISF and plasma. Because ISF does not clot, these biomarkers could be continuously monitored in ISF similar to current continuous glucose monitors but without requiring an indwelling subcutaneous sensor. Biomarkers distinct to ISF included molecules associated with systemic and dermatological physiology, as well as exogenous compounds from environmental exposures. We also determined that pharmacokinetics of caffeine in healthy adults and pharmacodynamics of glucose in children and young adults with diabetes were similar in ISF and plasma. Overall, these studies provide a minimally invasive method to sample dermal ISF using microneedles and demonstrate human ISF as a source of biomarkers that may enable research and translation for future clinical applications.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the effect of the environment on human health has benefited from progress made in measuring the exposome. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) has made it possible to measure small molecules across a large dynamic range, allowing researchers to study the role of low abundance environmental toxicants in causing human disease. HRMS data have a high dimensional structure (number of predictors >> number of observations), generating information on the abundance of many chemical features (predictors) which may be highly correlated. Unsupervised dimension reduction techniques can allow dimensionality reduction of the various features into components that capture the essence of the variability in the exposome dataset. We illustrate and discuss the relevance of three different unsupervised dimension reduction techniques: principal component analysis, factor analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization. We focus on the utility of each method in understanding the relationship between the exposome and a disease outcome and describe their strengths and limitations. While the utility of these methods is context specific, it remains important to focus on the interpretability of results from each method.",

To safeguard current and future generations from the increasing number of chemicals polluting our environment, a systematic and agnostic approach is needed. The \"exposome\" concept strives to capture the diversity and range of exposures to synthetic chemicals, dietary constituents, psychosocial stressors, and physical factors, as well as their corresponding biological responses. Technological advances such as high-resolution mass spectrometry and network science have allowed us to take the first steps toward a comprehensive assessment of the exposome. Given the increased recognition of the dominant role that nongenetic factors play in disease, an effort to characterize the exposome at a scale comparable to that of the human genome is warranted.",

        "Title": "The exposome - a new approach for risk assessment.",
        "Abstract": "Complementing the human genome with an exposome reflects the increasingly obvious impact of environmental exposure, which far exceeds the role of genetics, on human health. Considering the complexity of exposures and, in addition, the reactions of the body to exposures - i.e., the exposome - reverses classical exposure science where the precise measurement of single or few exposures is associated with specific health or environmental effects. The complete description of an individual's exposome is impossible; even less so is that of a population. We can, however, cast a wider net by foregoing some rigor in assessment and compensating with the statistical power of rich datasets. The advent of omics technologies enables a relatively cheap, high-content description of the biological effects of substances, especially in tissues and biofluids. They can be combined with many other rich data-streams, creating big data of exposure and effect. Computational methods increasingly allow data integration, discerning the signal from the noise and formulating hypotheses of exposure-effect relationships. These can be followed up in a targeted way. With a better exposure element in the risk equation, exposomics - new kid on the block of risk assessment - promises to identify novel exposure (interactions) and health/environment effect associations. This may also create opportunities to prioritize the more relevant chemicals for risk assessment, thereby lowering the burden on hazard assessment in an expo-sure-driven approach. Technological developments and synergies between approaches, quality assurance (ultimately as Good Exposome Practices), and the integration of mechanistic thinking will advance this approach.",

        "Abstract": "A subset of people exposed to a traumatic event develops post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is associated with dysregulated fear behavior. Genetic variation in SLC18A2, the gene that encodes vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), has been reported to affect risk for the development of PTSD in humans. Here, we use transgenic mice that express either 5% (VMAT2-LO mice) or 200% (VMAT2-HI mice) of wild-type levels of VMAT2 protein. We report that VMAT2-LO mice have reduced VMAT2 protein in the hippocampus and amygdala, impaired monoaminergic vesicular storage capacity in both the striatum and frontal cortex, decreased monoamine metabolite abundance and a greatly reduced capacity to release dopamine upon stimulation. Furthermore, VMAT2-LO mice showed exaggerated cued and contextual fear expression, altered fear habituation, inability to discriminate threat from safety cues, altered startle response compared with wild-type mice and an anxiogenic-like phenotype, but displayed no deficits in social function. By contrast, VMAT2-HI mice exhibited increased VMAT2 protein throughout the brain, higher vesicular storage capacity and greater dopamine release upon stimulation compared with wild-type controls. Behaviorally, VMAT2-HI mice were similar to wild-type mice in most assays, with some evidence of a reduced anxiety-like responses. Together, these data show that presynaptic monoamine function mediates PTSD-like outcomes in our mouse model, and suggest a causal link between reduced VMAT2 expression and fear behavior, consistent with the correlational relationship between VMAT2 genotype and PTSD risk in humans. Targeting this system is a potential strategy for the development of pharmacotherapies for disorders like PTSD.",

However, approaches to characterize exogenous health triggers have largely not leveraged advances in analytical platforms and big data. In this review, we highlight the exposome, which is defined as the cumulative measure of exposure and biological responses across a lifetime as a cornerstone for new epidemiology approaches to study complex and preventable human diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Although intermittent increases in inflammation are critical for survival during physical injury and infection, recent research has revealed that certain social, environmental and lifestyle factors can promote systemic chronic inflammation (SCI) that can, in turn, lead to several diseases that collectively represent the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. In the present Perspective we describe the multi-level mechanisms underlying SCI and several risk factors that promote this health-damaging phenotype, including infections, physical inactivity, poor diet, environmental and industrial toxicants and psychological stress. Furthermore, we suggest potential strategies for advancing the early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of SCI.",

In vertebrates, SV2s are 12-transmembrane proteins present on every secretory vesicle, including synaptic vesicles, and are critical to neurotransmission. Structural and functional studies suggest that SV2 proteins may play several roles to promote proper vesicular function. Among these roles are their potential to stabilize the transmitter content of vesicles, to maintain and orient the releasable pool of vesicles, and to regulate vesicular calcium sensitivity to ensure efficient, coordinated release of the transmitter. The SV2 family is highly relevant to human health in a number of ways. First, SV2A plays a role in neuronal excitability and as such is the specific target for the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam. SV2 proteins also act as the target by which potent neurotoxins, particularly botulinum, gain access to neurons and exert their toxicity. Both SV2B and SV2C are increasingly implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Interestingly, despite decades of intensive research, their exact function remains elusive. Thus, SV2 proteins are intriguing in their potentially diverse roles within the presynaptic terminal, and several recent developments have enhanced our understanding and appreciation of the protein family. Here, we review the structure and function of SV2 proteins as well as their relevance to disease and therapeutic development.",

        "Title": "Challenges in IBD Research: Environmental Triggers.",
        "Abstract": "Environmental triggers is part of five focus areas of the Challenges in IBD research document, which also includes preclinical human IBD mechanisms, novel technologies, precision medicine and pragmatic clinical research. The Challenges in IBD research document provides a comprehensive overview of current gaps in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) research and delivers actionable approaches to address them. It is the result of a multidisciplinary input from scientists, clinicians, patients, and funders, and represents a valuable resource for patient centric research prioritization. In particular, the environmental triggers section is focused on the main research gaps in elucidating causality of environmental factors in IBD. Research gaps were identified in: 1) epidemiology of exposures; 2) identification of signatures of biological response to exposures; and 3) mechanisms of how environmental exposures drive IBD. To address these gaps, the implementation of longitudinal prospective studies to determine disease evolution and identify sub-clinical changes in response to exposures is proposed. This can help define critical windows of vulnerability and risk prediction. In addition, systems biology analysis and in silico modeling were proposed as approaches to integrate the IBD exposome for the identification of biological signatures of response to exposures, and to develop prediction models of the effects of environmental factors in driving disease activity and response to therapy. This research could lead to identification of biomarkers of exposures and new modalities for therapeutic intervention. Finally, hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies to understand gene-environment interactions and to validate causality of priority factors should be performed to determine how environment influences clinical outcomes.",

        "Title": "Cardiac Toxicity From Ethanol Exposure in Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes.",
        "Abstract": "Alcohol use prior to and during pregnancy remains a significant societal problem and can lead to developmental fetal abnormalities including compromised myocardia function and increased risk for heart disease later in life. Alcohol-induced cardiac toxicity has traditionally been studied in animal-based models. These models have limitations due to physiological differences from human cardiomyocytes (CMs) and are also not suitable for high-throughput screening. We hypothesized that human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs (hiPSC-CMs) could serve as a useful tool to study alcohol-induced cardiac defects and/or toxicity. In this study, hiPSC-CMs were treated with ethanol at doses corresponding to the clinically relevant levels of alcohol intoxication. hiPSC-CMs exposed to ethanol showed a dose-dependent increase in cellular damage and decrease in cell viability, corresponding to increased production of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, ethanol exposure also generated dose-dependent increased irregular Ca2+ transients and contractility in hiPSC-CMs. RNA-seq analysis showed significant alteration in genes belonging to the potassium voltage-gated channel family or solute carrier family, partially explaining the irregular Ca2+ transients and contractility in ethanol-treated hiPSC-CMs. RNA-seq also showed significant upregulation in the expression of genes associated with collagen and extracellular matrix modeling, and downregulation of genes involved in cardiovascular system development and actin filament-based process. These results suggest that hiPSC-CMs can be a novel and physiologically relevant system for the study of alcohol-induced cardiac toxicity.",

        "Abstract": "Although polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated biphenyls are no longer manufactured the United States, biomonitoring in human populations show that exposure to these pollutants persist in human tissues. The objective of this study was to identify metabolic variations associated with exposure to 2,2'4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (PBB-153) and 2,2'4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153) in two generations of participants enrolled in the Michigan PBB Registry (http://pbbregistry.emory.edu/). Untargeted, high-resolution metabolomic profiling of plasma collected from 156 individuals was completed using liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry. PBB-153 and PCB-153 levels were measured in the same individuals using targeted gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and tested for dose-dependent correlation with the metabolome. Biological response to these exposures were evaluated using identified endogenous metabolites and pathway enrichment. When compared to lipid-adjusted concentrations for adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for years 2003-2004, PCB-153 levels were consistent with similarly aged individuals, whereas PBB-153 concentrations were elevated (p<0.0001) in participants enrolled in the Michigan PBB Registry. Metabolic alterations were correlated with PBB-153 and PCB-153 in both generations of participants, and included changes in pathways related to catecholamine metabolism, cellular respiration, essential fatty acids, lipids and polyamine metabolism. These pathways were consistent with pathophysiological changes observed in neurodegenerative disease and included previously identified metabolomic markers of Parkinson's disease. To determine if the metabolic alterations detected in this study are replicated other cohorts, we evaluated correlation of PBB-153 and PCB-153 with plasma fatty acids measured in NHANES. Both pollutants showed similar associations with fatty acids previously linked to PCB exposure. Thus, the results from this study show metabolic alterations correlated with PBB-153 and PCB-153 exposure can be detected in human populations and are consistent with health outcomes previously reported in epidemiological and mechanistic studies.",

With the genome, it defines the phenome of an individual. The measurement of complex environmental factors that exert pressure on our health has not kept pace with genomics and historically has not provided a similar level of resolution. Emerging technologies make it possible to obtain detailed information on drugs, toxicants, pollutants, nutrients, and physical and psychological stressors on an omic scale. These forces can also be assessed at systems and network levels, providing a framework for advances in pharmacology and toxicology. The exposome paradigm can improve the analysis of drug interactions and detection of adverse effects of drugs and toxicants and provide data on biological responses to exposures. The comprehensive model can provide data at the individual level for precision medicine, group level for clinical trials, and population level for public health.",

        "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) represent a highly ubiquitous group of synthetic chemicals used in products ranging from water and oil repellents and lubricants to firefighting foam. These substances can enter and accumulate in multiple tissue matrices in up to 100% of people assessed. Though animal models strongly identify these compounds as male reproductive toxicants, with exposed rodents experiencing declines in sperm count, alterations in hormones, and DNA damage in spermatids, among other adverse outcomes, human studies report conflicting conclusions as to the reproductive toxicity of these chemicals. Using an innovative, human stem-cell-based model of spermatogenesis, we assessed the effects of the PFASs perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and a mixture of PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA for their impacts on human spermatogenesis in vitro under conditions relevant to the general and occupationally exposed populations. Here, we show that PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, and a mixture of PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA do not decrease in vitro germ cell viability, consistent with reports from human studies. These compounds do not affect mitochondrial membrane potential or increase reactive oxygen species generation, and they do not decrease cell viability of spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, or spermatids in vitro under the conditions examined. However, exposure to PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA reduces expression of markers for spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes. While not having direct effects on germ cell viability, these effects suggest the potential for long-term impacts on male fertility through the exhaustion of the spermatogonial stem cell pool and abnormalities in primary spermatocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Sperm counts have rapidly declined in Western males over the past four decades. This rapid decline remains largely unexplained, but exposure to environmental toxicants provides one potential explanation for this decline. Flame retardants are highly prevalent and persistent in the environment, but many have not been assessed for their effects on human spermatogenesis. Using a human stem cell-based model of spermatogenesis, we evaluated two major flame retardants, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), under acute conditions simulating occupational-level exposures. Here we show that HBCDD and TBBPA are human male reproductive toxicants ",

        "Abstract": "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are ion channels comprising tetrameric assemblies of GluN1 and GluN2 receptor subunits that mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Of the four different GluN2 subunits, the GluN2D subunit-containing NMDARs have been suggested as a target for antiparkinsonian therapy because of their expression pattern in some of the basal ganglia nuclei that show abnormal firing patterns in the parkinsonian state, specifically the subthalamic nucleus (STN). In this study, we demonstrate that blockade of NMDARs altered spike firing in the STN in a male nonhuman primate that had been rendered parkinsonian by treatment with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. In accompanying experiments in male rodents, we found that GluN2D-NMDAR expression in the STN was reduced in acutely or chronically dopamine-depleted animals. Taken together, our data suggest that blockade of NMDARs in the STN may be a viable antiparkinsonian strategy, but that the ultimate success of this approach may be complicated by parkinsonism-associated changes in NMDAR expression in the STN.",

        "Abstract": "The final meeting of the EXPOsOMICS project \"Final Policy Workshop and Stakeholder Consultation\" took place 28-29 March 2017 to present the main results of the project and discuss their implications both for future research and for regulatory and policy activities. This paper summarizes presentations and discussions at the meeting related with the main results and advances in exposome research achieved through the EXPOsOMICS project; on other parallel research initiatives on the study of the exposome in Europe and in the United States and their complementarity to EXPOsOMICS; lessons learned from these early studies on the exposome and how they may shape the future of research on environmental exposure assessment; and finally the broader implications of exposome research for risk assessment and policy development on environmental exposures. The main results of EXPOsOMICS in relation to studies of the external exposome and internal exposome in relation to both air pollution and water contaminants were presented as well as new technologies for environmental health research (adductomics) and advances in statistical methods. Although exposome research strengthens the scientific basis for policy development, there is a need in terms of showing added value for public health to: improve communication of research results to non-scientific audiences; target research to the broader landscape of societal challenges; and draw applicable conclusions. Priorities for future work include the development and standardization of methodologies and technologies for assessing the external and internal exposome, improved data sharing and integration, and the demonstration of the added value of exposome science over conventional approaches in answering priority policy questions.",

        "Abstract": "Interstitial fluid (ISF) surrounds the cells and tissues of the body. Since ISF has molecular components similar to plasma, as well as compounds produced locally in tissues, it may be a valuable source of biomarkers for diagnostics and monitoring. However, there has not been a comprehensive study to determine the metabolite composition of ISF and to compare it to plasma. In this study, the metabolome of suction blister fluid (SBF), which largely consists of ISF, collected from 10 human volunteers was analyzed using untargeted high-resolution metabolomics (HRM). A wide range of metabolites were detected in SBF, including amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, and compounds of exogenous origin. Various systemic and skin-derived metabolite biomarkers were elevated or found uniquely in SBF, and many other metabolites of clinical and physiological significance were well correlated between SBF and plasma. In sum, using untargeted HRM profiling, this study shows that SBF can be a valuable source of information about metabolites relevant to human health.",

        "Title": "Immunochemical analysis of the expression of SV2C in mouse, macaque and human brain.",
        "Abstract": "The synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C (SV2C) is an undercharacterized protein with enriched expression in phylogenetically old brain regions. Its precise role within the brain is unclear, though various lines of evidence suggest that SV2C is involved in the function of synaptic vesicles through the regulation of vesicular trafficking, calcium-induced exocytosis, or synaptotagmin function. SV2C has been linked to multiple neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease and psychiatric conditions. SV2C is expressed in various cell types-primarily dopaminergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic cells. In mice, it is most highly expressed in nuclei within the basal ganglia, though it is unknown if this pattern of expression is consistent across species. Here, we use a custom SV2C-specific antiserum to describe localization within the brain of mouse, nonhuman primate, and human, including cell-type localization. We found that the immunoreactivity with this antiserum is consistent with previously-published antibodies, and confirmed localization of SV2C in the basal ganglia of rodent, rhesus macaque, and human. We observed strongest expression of SV2C in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, dorsal striatum, pallidum, and nucleus accumbens of each species. Further, we demonstrate colocalization between SV2C and markers of dopaminergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons within these brain regions. SV2C has been increasingly linked to dopamine and basal ganglia function. These antisera will be an important resource moving forward in our understanding of the role of SV2C in vesicle dynamics and neurological disease.",

In 2005, Christopher Wild introduced the concept of the exposome, which encompasses environmental exposures and concomitant biological responses throughout the life course. Exposome-based approaches have the potential to enable novel insights into numerous research questions in environmental health sciences. To promote and develop the concept of the exposome, the Health and Exposome Research Center: Understanding Lifetime Exposures (HERCULES) Exposome Research Center at Emory University held the first Emory Exposome Summer Course from 13-17 June 2016. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1712.",

        "Abstract": "Members of the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2) family of proteins are involved in synaptic function throughout the brain. The ubiquitously expressed SV2A has been widely implicated in epilepsy, although SV2C with its restricted basal ganglia distribution is poorly characterized. SV2C is emerging as a potentially relevant protein in Parkinson disease (PD), because it is a genetic modifier of sensitivity to l-DOPA and of nicotine neuroprotection in PD. Here we identify SV2C as a mediator of dopamine homeostasis and report that disrupted expression of SV2C within the basal ganglia is a pathological feature of PD. Genetic deletion of SV2C leads to reduced dopamine release in the dorsal striatum as measured by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, reduced striatal dopamine content, disrupted \u03b1-synuclein expression, deficits in motor function, and alterations in neurochemical effects of nicotine. Furthermore, SV2C expression is dramatically altered in postmortem brain tissue from PD cases but not in Alzheimer disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, or multiple system atrophy. This disruption was paralleled in mice overexpressing mutated \u03b1-synuclein. These data establish SV2C as a mediator of dopamine neuron function and suggest that SV2C disruption is a unique feature of PD that likely contributes to dopaminergic dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "The exposome encompasses an individual's exposure to exogenous chemicals, as well as endogenous chemicals that are produced or altered in response to external stressors. While the exposome concept has been established for human health, its principles can be extended to include broader ecological issues. The assessment of exposure is tightly interlinked with hazard assessment. Here, we explore if mechanistic understanding of the causal links between exposure and adverse effects on human health and the environment can be improved by integrating the exposome approach with the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) concept that structures and organizes the sequence of biological events from an initial molecular interaction of a chemical with a biological target to an adverse outcome. Complementing exposome research with the AOP concept may facilitate a mechanistic understanding of stress-induced adverse effects, examine the relative contributions from various components of the exposome, determine the primary risk drivers in complex mixtures, and promote an integrative assessment of chemical risks for both human and environmental health.",

        "Abstract": "Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2, SLC18A2) is a transmembrane transporter protein that packages dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine into vesicles in preparation for neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron. VMAT2 function and related vesicle dynamics have been linked to susceptibility to oxidative stress, exogenous toxicants, and Parkinson's disease. To address a recent depletion of commonly used antibodies to VMAT2, we generated and characterized a novel rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against a 19 amino acid epitope corresponding to an antigenic sequence within the C-terminal tail of mouse VMAT2. We used genetic models of altered VMAT2 expression to demonstrate that the antibody specifically recognizes VMAT2 and localizes to synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, immunohistochemical labeling using this VMAT2 antibody produces immunoreactivity that is consistent with expected VMAT2 regional distribution. We show the distribution of VMAT2 in monoaminergic brain regions of mouse brain, notably the midbrain, striatum, olfactory tubercle, dopaminergic paraventricular nuclei, tuberomammillary nucleus, raphe nucleus, and locus coeruleus. Normal neurotransmitter vesicle dynamics are critical for proper health and functioning of the nervous system, and this well-characterized VMAT2 antibody will be a useful tool in studying neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions characterized by vesicular dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "Drugs of abuse induce sensitization, which is defined as enhanced response to additional drug following a period of withdrawal. Sensitization occurs in both humans and animal models of drug reinforcement and contributes substantially to the addictive nature of drugs of abuse, because it is thought to represent enhanced motivational wanting for drug. The ventral pallidum, a key member of the reward pathway, contributes to behaviors associated with reward, such as sensitization. Dopamine inputs to the ventral pallidum have not been directly characterized. Here we provide anatomical, neurochemical, and behavioral evidence demonstrating that dopamine terminals in the ventral pallidum contribute to reward in mice. We report subregional differences in dopamine release, measured by ex vivo fast-scan cyclic voltammetry: rostral ventral pallidum exhibits increased dopamine release and uptake compared with caudal ventral pallidum, which is correlated with tissue expression of dopaminergic proteins. We then subjected mice to a methamphetamine-sensitization protocol to investigate the contribution of dopaminergic projections to the region in reward related behavior. Methamphetamine-sensitized animals displayed a 508% and 307% increase in baseline dopamine release in the rostral and caudal ventral pallidum, respectively. Augmented dopamine release in the rostral ventral pallidum was significantly correlated with sensitized locomotor activity. Moreover, this presynaptic dopaminergic plasticity occurred only in the ventral pallidum and not in the ventral or dorsal striatum, suggesting that dopamine release in the ventral pallidum may be integrally important to drug-induced sensitization.",

        "Title": "Membrane transporters as mediators of synaptic dopamine dynamics: implications for disease.",
        "Abstract": "Dopamine was first identified as a neurotransmitter localized to the midbrain over 50\u00a0years ago. The dopamine transporter (DAT; SLC6A3) and the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2; SLC18A2) are regulators of dopamine homeostasis in the presynaptic neuron. DAT transports dopamine from the extracellular space into the cytosol of the presynaptic terminal. VMAT2 then packages this cytosolic dopamine into vesicular compartments for subsequent release upon neurotransmission. Thus, DAT and VMAT2 act in concert to move the transmitter efficiently throughout the neuron. Accumulation of dopamine in the neuronal cytosol can trigger oxidative stress and neurotoxicity, suggesting that the proper compartmentalization of dopamine is critical for neuron function and risk of disease. For decades, studies have examined the effects of reduced transporter function in mice (e.g. DAT-KO, VMAT2-KO, VMAT2-deficient). However, we have only recently been able to assess the effects of elevated transporter expression using BAC transgenic methods (DAT-tg, VMAT2-HI mice). Complemented with in\u00a0vitro work and neurochemical techniques to assess dopamine compartmentalization, a new focus on the importance of transporter proteins as both models of human disease and potential drug targets has emerged. Here, we review the importance of DAT and VMAT2 function in the delicate balance of neuronal dopamine.",

        "Abstract": "The vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) packages neurotransmitters for release during neurotransmission and sequesters toxicants into vesicles to prevent neuronal damage. In mice, low VMAT2 levels causes catecholaminergic cell loss and behaviors resembling Parkinson's disease, while high levels of VMAT2 increase dopamine release and protect against dopaminergic toxicants. However, comparisons across these VMAT2 mouse genotypes were impossible due to the differing genetic background strains of the animals. Following back-crossing to a C57BL/6\u2009line, we confirmed that mice with approximately 95% lower VMAT2 levels compared with wild-type (VMAT2-LO) display significantly reduced vesicular uptake, progressive dopaminergic terminal loss with aging, and exacerbated 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) toxicity. Conversely, VMAT2-overexpressing mice (VMAT2-HI) are protected from the loss of striatal terminals following MPTP treatment. We also provide evidence that enhanced vesicular filling in the VMAT2-HI mice modifies the handling of newly synthesized dopamine, indicated by changes in indirect measures of extracellular dopamine clearance. These results confirm the role of VMAT2 in the protection of vulnerable nigrostriatal dopamine neurons and may also provide new insight into the side effects of L-DOPA treatments in Parkinson's disease.",

        "Title": "Reduced vesicular monoamine transport disrupts serotonin signaling but does not cause serotonergic degeneration.",
        "Abstract": "We previously demonstrated that mice with reduced expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2 LO) undergo age-related degeneration of the catecholamine-producing neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and locus ceruleus and exhibit motor disturbances and depressive-like behavior. In this work, we investigated the effects of reduced vesicular transport on the function and viability of serotonin neurons in these mice. Adult (4-6 months of age), VMAT2 LO mice exhibit dramatically reduced (90%) serotonin release capacity, as measured by fast scan cyclic voltammetry. We observed changes in serotonin receptor responsivity in in vivo pharmacological assays. Aged (months) VMAT2 LO mice exhibited abolished 5-HT1A autoreceptor sensitivity, as determined by 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg) induction of hypothermia. When challenged with the 5HT2 agonist, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (1 mg/kg), VMAT2 LO mice exhibited a marked increase (50%) in head twitch responses. We observed sparing of serotonergic terminals in aged mice (18-24 months) throughout the forebrain by SERT immunohistochemistry and [(3)H]-paroxetine binding in striatal homogenates of aged VMAT2 LO mice. In contrast to their loss of catecholamine neurons of the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus, aged VMAT2 LO mice do not exhibit a change in the number of serotonergic (TPH2+) neurons within the dorsal raphe, as measured by unbiased stereology at 26-30 months. Collectively, these data indicate that reduced vesicular monoamine transport significantly disrupts serotonergic signaling, but does not drive degeneration of serotonin neurons.",

        "Abstract": "The exposome is the cumulative measure of environmental influences and associated biological responses throughout the lifespan, including exposures from the environment, diet, behavior, and endogenous processes. A major challenge for exposome research lies in the development of robust and affordable analytic procedures to measure the broad range of exposures and associated biologic impacts occurring over a lifetime. Biomonitoring is an established approach to evaluate internal body burden of environmental exposures, but use of biomonitoring for exposome research is often limited by the high costs associated with quantification of individual chemicals. High-resolution metabolomics (HRM) uses ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry with minimal sample preparation to support high-throughput relative quantification of thousands of environmental, dietary, and microbial chemicals. HRM also measures metabolites in most endogenous metabolic pathways, thereby providing simultaneous measurement of biologic responses to environmental exposures. The present research examined quantification strategies to enhance the usefulness of HRM data for cumulative exposome research. The results provide a simple reference standardization protocol in which individual chemical concentrations in unknown samples are estimated by comparison to a concurrently analyzed, pooled reference sample with known chemical concentrations. The approach was tested using blinded analyses of amino acids in human samples and was found to be comparable to independent laboratory results based on surrogate standardization or internal standardization. Quantification was reproducible over a 13-month period and extrapolated to thousands of chemicals. The results show that reference standardization protocol provides an effective strategy that will enhance data collection for cumulative exposome research. In principle, the approach can be extended to other types of mass spectrometry and other analytical methods.",

        "Abstract": "Preferential dysfunction/degeneration of midbrain substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons contributes to the main movement symptoms manifested in Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) G2019S missense mutation (LRRK2 G2019S) is the most common causative genetic factor linked to PD, the effects of LRRK2 G2019S on the function and survival of SNpc DA neurons are poorly understood. Using a binary gene expression system, we generated transgenic mice expressing either wild-type human LRRK2 (WT mice) or the LRRK2 G2019S mutation (G2019S mice) selectively in the midbrain DA neurons. Here we show that overexpression of LRRK2 G2019S did not induce overt motor abnormalities or substantial SNpc DA neuron loss. However, the LRRK2 G2019S mutation impaired dopamine homeostasis and release in aged mice. This reduction in dopamine content/release coincided with the degeneration of DA axon terminals and decreased expression of DA neuron-enriched genes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), vesicular monoamine transporter 2, dopamine transporter and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1. These factors are responsible for dopamine synthesis, transport and degradation, and their expression is regulated by transcription factor paired-like homeodomain 3 (PITX3). Levels of Pitx3 mRNA and protein were similarly decreased in the SNpc DA neurons of aged G2019S mice. Together, these findings suggest that PITX3-dependent transcription regulation could be one of the many potential mechanisms by which LRRK2 G2019S acts in SNpc DA neurons, resulting in downregulation of its downstream target genes critical for dopamine homeostasis and release.",

        "Title": "Increased Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2 (VMAT2; Slc18a2) Protects against Methamphetamine Toxicity.",
        "Abstract": "The psychostimulant methamphetamine (METH) is highly addictive and neurotoxic to dopamine terminals. METH toxicity has been suggested to be due to the release and accumulation of dopamine in the cytosol of these terminals. The vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2; SLC18A2) is a critical mediator of dopamine handling. Mice overexpressing VMAT2 (VMAT2-HI) have an increased vesicular capacity to store dopamine, thus augmenting striatal dopamine levels and dopamine release in the striatum. Based on the altered compartmentalization of intracellular dopamine in the VMAT2-HI mice, we assessed whether enhanced vesicular function was capable of reducing METH-induced damage to the striatal dopamine system. While wildtype mice show significant losses in striatal levels of the dopamine transporter (65% loss) and tyrosine hydroxylase (46% loss) following a 4 \u00d7 10 mg/kg METH dosing regimen, VMAT2-HI mice were protected from this damage. VMAT2-HI mice were also spared from the inflammatory response that follows METH treatment, showing an increase in astroglial markers that was approximately one-third of that of wildtype animals (117% vs 36% increase in GFAP, wildtype vs VMAT2-HI). Further analysis also showed that elevated VMAT2 level does not alter the ability of METH to increase core body temperature, a mechanism integral to the toxicity of the drug. Finally, the VMAT2-HI mice showed no difference from wildtype littermates on both METH-induced conditioned place preference and in METH-induced locomotor activity (1 mg/kg METH). These results demonstrate that elevated VMAT2 protects against METH toxicity without enhancing the rewarding effects of the drug. Since the VMAT2-HI mice are protected from METH despite higher basal dopamine levels, this study suggests that METH toxicity depends more on the proper compartmentalization of synaptic dopamine than on the absolute amount of dopamine in the brain.",

        "Title": "Developmental pesticide exposure reproduces features of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.",
        "Abstract": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is estimated to affect 8-12% of school-age children worldwide. ADHD is a complex disorder with significant genetic contributions. However, no single gene has been linked to a significant percentage of cases, suggesting that environmental factors may contribute to ADHD. Here, we used behavioral, molecular, and neurochemical techniques to characterize the effects of developmental exposure to the pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin. We also used epidemiologic methods to determine whether there is an association between pyrethroid exposure and diagnosis of ADHD. Mice exposed to the pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin during development exhibit several features reminiscent of ADHD, including elevated dopamine transporter (DAT) levels, hyperactivity, working memory and attention deficits, and impulsive-like behavior. Increased DAT and D1 dopamine receptor levels appear to be responsible for the behavioral deficits. Epidemiologic data reveal that children aged 6-15 with detectable levels of pyrethroid metabolites in their urine were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. Our epidemiologic finding, combined with the recapitulation of ADHD behavior in pesticide-treated mice, provides a mechanistic basis to suggest that developmental pyrethroid exposure is a risk factor for ADHD.",

        "Abstract": "Despite a movement away from dopamine-focused Parkinson's disease (PD) research, a recent surge of evidence now suggests that altered vesicular storage of dopamine may contribute to the demise of the nigral neurons in this disease. Human studies demonstrate that the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2; SLC18A2) is dysfunctional in PD brain. Moreover, studies with transgenic mice suggest that there is an untapped reserve capacity of the dopamine vesicle that could be unbridled by increasing VMAT2 function. Therapeutic manipulation of VMAT2 level or function has the potential to improve efficacy of dopamine derived from administered levodopa, increase dopamine neurotransmission from remaining midbrain dopamine neurons and protect against neurotoxic insults. Thus, the development of drugs to enhance the storage of release of dopamine may be a fruitful avenue of research for PD.",

        "Abstract": "Disruption of neurotransmitter vesicle dynamics (transport, capacity, release) has been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions. Here, we report a novel mouse model of enhanced vesicular function via bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-mediated overexpression of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2; Slc18a2). A twofold increase in vesicular transport enhances the vesicular capacity for dopamine (56%), dopamine vesicle volume (33%), and basal tissue dopamine levels (21%) in the mouse striatum. The elevated vesicular capacity leads to an increase in stimulated dopamine release (84%) and extracellular dopamine levels (44%). VMAT2-overexpressing mice show improved outcomes on anxiety and depressive-like behaviors and increased basal locomotor activity (41%). Finally, these mice exhibit significant protection from neurotoxic insult by the dopaminergic toxicant 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), as measured by reduced dopamine terminal damage and substantia nigra pars compacta cell loss. The increased release of dopamine and neuroprotection from MPTP toxicity in the VMAT2-overexpressing mice suggest that interventions aimed at enhancing vesicular capacity may be of therapeutic benefit in Parkinson disease.",

        "Title": "A vesicular sequestration to oxidative deamination shift in myocardial sympathetic nerves in Parkinson's disease.",
        "Abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), profound putamen dopamine (DA) depletion reflects denervation and a shift from vesicular sequestration to oxidative deamination of cytoplasmic DA in residual terminals. PD also involves cardiac sympathetic denervation. Whether PD entails myocardial norepinephrine (NE) depletion and a sequestration-deamination shift have been unknown. We measured apical myocardial tissue concentrations of NE, DA, and their neuronal metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) from 23 PD patients and 23 controls and ascertained the extent of myocardial NE depletion in PD. We devised, validated in VMAT2-Lo mice, and applied 5 neurochemical indices of the sequestration-deamination shift-concentration ratios of DOPAC:DA, DA:NE, DHPG:NE, DOPAC:NE, and DHPG:DOPAC-and used a kinetic model to estimate the extent of the vesicular storage defect. The PD group had decreased myocardial NE content (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The majority of patients (70%) had severe NE depletion (mean 2% of control), and in this subgroup all five indices of a sequestration-deamination shift were increased compared to controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for each). Vesicular storage in residual nerves was estimated to be decreased by 84-91% in this subgroup. We conclude that most PD patients have severe myocardial NE depletion, because of both sympathetic denervation and decreased vesicular storage in residual nerves. We found that the majority (70%) of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have profound (98%) myocardial norepinephrine depletion, because of both cardiac sympathetic denervation and a shift from vesicular sequestration to oxidative deamination of cytoplasmic catecholamines in the residual nerves. This shift may be part of a final common pathogenetic pathway in the loss of catecholaminergic neurons that characterizes PD.",

        "Title": "Adenosine A2A receptor antagonism reverses inflammation-induced impairment of microglial process extension in a model of Parkinson's disease.",
        "Abstract": "Microglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system, constantly survey the parenchyma in the healthy brain to maintain homeostasis. When a disturbance, such as cell death, results in ATP release in vivo, microglial processes respond by utilizing P2Y12 purinergic receptors to trigger extension toward the site of damage. Processes ultimately surround the injury site, preventing the spread of harmful cellular constituents and assisting with tissue repair. In contrast to the healthy brain, many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, are characterized by the presence of neuroinflammation. Yet, the ability of microglia to respond to tissue damage under pro-inflammatory conditions has not been well studied. To assess the ability of microglia to respond to tissue injury and localized cell death in the context of Parkinson's disease, we performed confocal imaging of acute brain slices from mice with microglia-specific green fluorescent protein expression. Microglia in coronal slices containing the substantia nigra extend processes toward a mechanical injury in a P2Y12 receptor-dependent manner. However, microglia in mice treated for 5days with 20mg/kg/day 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) show significantly reduced process displacement toward the injury compared to microglia in control animals. Pre-treatment of slices from MPTP-injected mice with the A2A receptor-selective antagonist preladenant restores the ability of activated microglia to respond to tissue damage. These data support the hypothesis that chronic inflammation impedes microglial motility in response to further injury, such as cell death, and suggest that some aspects of the neuroprotection observed with adenosine A2A receptor antagonists may involve direct or indirect actions at microglia.",

        "Title": "Wavelength and temperature-dependent apparent quantum yields for photochemical formation of hydrogen peroxide in seawater.",
        "Abstract": "Wavelength and temperature-dependent apparent quantum yields (AQYs) were determined for the photochemical production of hydrogen peroxide using seawater obtained from coastal and oligotrophic stations in Antarctica, the Pacific Ocean at Station ALOHA, the Gulf of Mexico, and at several sites along the East Coast of the United States. For all samples, AQYs decreased exponentially with increasing wavelength at 25 \u00b0C, ranging from 4.6 \u00d7 10(-4) to 10.4 \u00d7 10(-4) at 290 nm to 0.17 \u00d7 10(-4) to 0.97 \u00d7 10(-4) at 400 nm. AQYs for different seawater samples were remarkably similar irrespective of expected differences in the composition and concentrations of metals and dissolved organic matter (DOM) and in prior light exposure histories; wavelength-dependent AQYs for individual seawater samples differed by less than a factor of two relative to respective mean AQYs. Temperature-dependent AQYs increased between 0 and 35 \u00b0C on average by a factor of 1.8 per 10 \u00b0C, consistent with a thermal reaction (e.g., superoxide dismutation) controlling H2O2 photochemical production rates in seawater. Taken together, these results suggest that the observed poleward decrease in H\u2082O\u2082 photochemical production rates is mainly due to corresponding poleward decreases in irradiance and temperature and not spatial variations in the composition and concentrations of DOM or metals. Hydrogen peroxide photoproduction AQYs and production rates were not constant and not independent of the photon exposure as has been implicitly assumed in many published studies. Therefore, care should be taken when comparing and interpreting published H\u2082O\u2082 AQY or photochemical production rate results. Modeled depth-integrated H\u2082O\u2082 photochemical production rates were in excellent agreement with measured rates obtained from in situ free-floating drifter experiments conducted during a Gulf of Maine cruise, with differences (ca. 10%) well within measurement and modeling uncertainties. Results from this study provide a comprehensive data set of wavelength and temperature-dependent AQYs to model and remotely sense hydrogen peroxide photochemical production rates globally.",

        "Abstract": "Active transport of neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles is required for their subsequent exocytotic release. In the monoamine system, this process is carried out by the vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT1 and VMAT2). These proteins are responsible for vesicular packaging of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine. These proteins are essential for proper neuronal function; however, compared to their plasma membrane counterparts, there are few drugs available that target these vesicular proteins. This is partly due to the added complexity of crossing the plasma membrane, but also to the technical difficulty of assaying for vesicular uptake in high throughput. Until recently, reagents to enable high throughput screening for function of these vesicular neurotransmitter transporters have not been available. Fortunately, novel compounds and methods are now making such screening possible; thus, a renewed focus on these transporters as potential targets is timely and necessary.",

        "Title": "Rotenone and paraquat perturb dopamine metabolism: A computational analysis of pesticide toxicity.",
        "Abstract": "Pesticides, such as rotenone and paraquat, are suspected in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), whose hallmark is the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Thus, compounds expected to play a role in the pathogenesis of PD will likely impact the function of dopaminergic neurons. To explore the relationship between pesticide exposure and dopaminergic toxicity, we developed a custom-tailored mathematical model of dopamine metabolism and utilized it to infer potential mechanisms underlying the toxicity of rotenone and paraquat, asking how these pesticides perturb specific processes. We performed two types of analyses, which are conceptually different and complement each other. The first analysis, a purely algebraic reverse engineering approach, analytically and deterministically computes the altered profile of enzyme activities that characterize the effects of a pesticide. The second method consists of large-scale Monte Carlo simulations that statistically reveal possible mechanisms of pesticides. The results from the reverse engineering approach show that rotenone and paraquat exposures lead to distinctly different flux perturbations. Rotenone seems to affect all fluxes associated with dopamine compartmentalization, whereas paraquat exposure perturbs fluxes associated with dopamine and its breakdown metabolites. The statistical results of the Monte-Carlo analysis suggest several specific mechanisms. The findings are interesting, because no a priori assumptions are made regarding specific pesticide actions, and all parameters characterizing the processes in the dopamine model are treated in an unbiased manner. Our results show how approaches from computational systems biology can help identify mechanisms underlying the toxicity of pesticide exposure.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder and, although the exact causes are unknown, recent epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that several environmental agents may be significant risk factors. To date, these suspected environmental risk factors have been man-made chemicals. In this report, we demonstrate via genetic, biochemical, and immunological studies that the common volatile fungal semiochemical 1-octen-3-ol reduces dopamine levels and causes dopamine neuron degeneration in Drosophila melanogaster. Overexpression of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) rescued the dopamine toxicity and neurodegeneration, whereas mutations decreasing VMAT and tyrosine hydroxylase exacerbated toxicity. Furthermore, 1-octen-3-ol also inhibited uptake of dopamine in human cell lines expressing the human plasma membrane dopamine transporter (DAT) and human VMAT ortholog, VMAT2. These data demonstrate that 1-octen-3-ol exerts toxicity via disruption of dopamine homeostasis and may represent a naturally occurring environmental agent involved in parkinsonism.",

        "Title": "Reduced vesicular storage of catecholamines causes progressive degeneration in the locus ceruleus.",
        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative motor disease. Pathologically, PD is characterized by Lewy body deposition and subsequent death of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. PD also consistently features degeneration of the locus ceruleus, the main source of norepinephrine in the central nervous system. We have previously reported a mouse model of dopaminergic neurodegeneration based on reduced expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2 LO). To determine if reduced vesicular storage can also cause noradrenergic degeneration, we examined indices of damage to the catecholaminergic systems in brain and cardiac tissue of VMAT2 LO mice. At two months of age, neurochemical analyses revealed substantial reductions in striatal dopamine (94%), cortical dopamine (57%) and norepinephrine (54%), as well as cardiac norepinephrine (97%). These losses were accompanied by increased conversion of dopamine and norepinephrine to their deaminated metabolites. VMAT2 LO mice exhibited loss of noradrenergic innervation in the cortex, as determined by norepinephrine transporter immunoreactivity and (3)H-nisoxetine binding. Using unbiased stereological techniques, we observed progressive degeneration in the locus ceruleus that preceded degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta. In contrast, the ventral tegmental area, which is spared in human PD, remained unaffected. The coordinate loss of dopamine and norepinephrine neurons in VMAT2 LO mice parallels the pattern of neurodegeneration that occurs in human PD, and demonstrates that insufficient catecholamine storage can cause spontaneous degeneration in susceptible neurons, underscoring cytosolic catecholamine catabolism as a determinant of neuronal susceptibility in PD.

        "Abstract": "Intra-neuronal metabolism of dopamine (DA) begins with production of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL),which is toxic. According to the 'catecholaldehyde hypothesis', DOPAL destroys nigrostriatal DA terminals and contributes to the profound putamen DA deficiency that characterizes Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). We tested the feasibility of using post-mortem patterns of putamen tissue catechols to examine contributions of altered activities of the type 2 vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) and aldehyde dehydrogenase(ALDH) to the increased DOPAL levels found in PD. Theoretically, the DA : DOPA concentration ratio indicates vesicular uptake, and the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid: DOPAL ratio indicates ALDH activity. We validated these indices in transgenic mice with very low vesicular uptake VMAT2-Lo) or with knockouts of the genes encoding ALDH1A1 and ALDH2 (ALDH1A1,2 KO), applied these indices in PD putamen, and estimated the percent decreases in vesicular uptake and ALDH activity in PD. VMAT2-Lo mice had markedly decreased DA:DOPA (50 vs. 1377, p < 0.0001),and ALDH1A1,2 KO mice had decreased 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid:DOPAL (1.0 vs. 11.2, p < 0.0001). In PD putamen, vesicular uptake was estimated to be decreased by 89% and ALDH activity by 70%. Elevated DOPAL levels in PD putamen reflect a combination of decreased vesicular uptake of cytosolic DA and decreased DOPAL detoxification by ALDH.",

        "Abstract": "The defining motor characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD) are mediated by the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA). Dopamine molecules spend most of their lifespan stored in intracellular vesicles awaiting release and very little time in the extracellular space or the cytosol. Without proper packaging of transmitter and trafficking of vesicles to the active zone, dopamine neurotransmission cannot occur. In the cytosol, dopamine is readily oxidized; excessive cytosolic dopamine oxidation may be pathogenic to nigral neurons in PD. Thus, factors that disrupt vesicular function may impair signaling and increase the vulnerability of dopamine neurons. This review outlines the many mechanisms by which disruption of vesicular function may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. From direct inhibition of dopamine transport into vesicles by pharmacological or toxicological agents to alterations in vesicle trafficking by PD-related gene products, variations in the proper compartmentalization of dopamine can wreak havoc on a functional dopamine pathway. Findings from patient populations, imaging studies, transgenic models, and mechanistic studies will be presented to document the relationship between impaired vesicular function and vulnerability of the nigrostriatal dopamine system. Given the deleterious effects of impaired vesicular function, strategies aimed at enhancing vesicular function may be beneficial in the treatment of PD.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway is associated with progressive neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). Given the role of neuronal RING finger protein 11 (RNF11) as a negative regulator of the NF-\u03baB pathway, in this report we investigated the function of RNF11 in dopaminergic cells in PD-associated neurodegeneration. We found that RNF11 knockdown in an in vitro model of PD mediated protection against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity. In converse, over-expression of RNF11 enhanced 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic cell death. Furthermore, by directly manipulating NF-\u03baB signaling, we showed that the observed RNF11-enhanced 6-OHDA toxicity is mediated through inhibition of NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription of TNF-\u03b1, antioxidants GSS and SOD1, and anti-apoptotic factor BCL2. Experiments in an in vivo 6-OHDA rat model of PD recapitulated the in vitro results. In vivo targeted RNF11 over-expression in nigral neurons enhanced 6-OHDA toxicity, as evident by increased amphetamine-induced rotations and loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons as compared to controls. This enhanced toxicity was coupled with the downregulation of NF-\u03baB transcribed GSS, SOD1, BCL2, and neurotrophic factor BDNF mRNA levels, in addition to decreased TNF-\u03b1 mRNA levels in ventral mesenchephalon samples. In converse, knockdown of RNF11 was associated with protective phenotypes and increased expression of above-mentioned NF-\u03baB transcribed genes. Collectively, our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that RNF11-mediated inhibition of NF-\u03baB in dopaminergic cells exaggerates 6-OHDA toxicity by inhibiting neuroprotective responses while loss of RNF11 inhibition on NF-\u03baB activity promotes neuronal survival. The decreased expression of RNF11 in surviving cortical and nigral tissue detected in PD patients, thus implies a compensatory response in the diseased brain to PD-associated insults. In summary, our findings demonstrate that RNF11 in neurons can modulate susceptibility to 6-OHDA toxicity through NF-\u03baB mediated responses. This neuron-specific role of RNF11 in the brain has important implications for targeted therapeutics aimed at preventing neurodegeneration.",

        "Abstract": "In the last several decades polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have replaced the previously banned polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in multiple flame retardant utilities. As epidemiological and laboratory studies have suggested PCBs as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), the similarities between PBDEs and PCBs suggest that PBDEs have the potential to be neurotoxic to the dopamine system. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neurotoxic effects of the PBDE mixture, DE-71, on the nigrostriatal dopamine system and address the role of altered dopamine handling in mediating this neurotoxicity. Using an in vitro model system we found DE-71 effectively caused cell death in a dopaminergic cell line as well as reducing the number of TH+ neurons isolated from VMAT2 WT and LO animals. Assessment of DE-71 neurotoxicity in vivo demonstrated significant deposition of PBDE congeners in the brains of mice, leading to reductions in striatal dopamine and dopamine handling, as well as reductions in the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) and VMAT2. Additionally, DE-71 elicited a significant locomotor deficit in the VMAT2 WT and LO mice. However, no change was seen in TH expression in dopamine terminal or in the number of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). To date, these are the first data to demonstrate that exposure to PBDEs disrupts the nigrostriatal dopamine system. Given their similarities to PCBs, additional laboratory and epidemiological research should be considered to assess PBDEs as a potential risk factor for PD and other neurological disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are synthetic chemicals primarily used as coolants and insulators in electrical equipment. Although banned for several decades, PCBs continue to exist in the environment because of their long half-life, continued presence in items produced before the ban, and poor disposal practices. Epidemiological and experimental studies have identified exposure to PCBs as a potential risk factor for Parkinson's disease, perhaps more so in females. The objective of this work was to examine the association between PCB levels in post-mortem human brain tissue and the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, as well as the degree of nigral depigmentation. We also sought to determine if this association was more significant when patients were stratified by sex. Post-mortem brain samples from control patients and those diagnosed with Parkinson's disease were obtained from the Emory University Brain Bank and from the Nun Study. Concentrations of eight prevalent PCB congeners were extracted from post-mortem brain tissue and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. PCB congeners 153 and 180 were significantly elevated in the brains of Parkinson's disease patients. When stratified by sex, the female Parkinson's disease group demonstrated significantly elevated concentrations of total PCBs and specifically congeners 138, 153, and 180 compared to controls, whereas PCB concentrations in males were not significantly different between control and Parkinson's disease groups. In a separate population of women (Nun Study) who had no clinical signs or symptoms of PD, elevated concentrations total PCB and congeners 138, 153 and 180 were also observed in post-mortem brain tissue exhibiting moderate nigral depigmentation compared to subjects with mild or no depigmentation. These quantitative data demonstrate an association between brain PCB levels and Parkinson's disease-related pathology. Furthermore, these data support epidemiological and laboratory studies reporting a link between PCB exposure and an increased risk for Parkinson's disease, including greater susceptibility of females.",

To investigate the effect of 25(OH)D depletion on neuronal susceptibility to toxic insult, we induced a state of 25(OH)D deficiency in mice and then challenged them with the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). We found there was no significant difference between control and 25(OH)D-deficient animals in striatal dopamine levels or dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase expression after lesioning with MPTP. Additionally, we found no difference in tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the substantia nigra pars compacta.

        "Title": "Transport behavior of functionalized multi-wall carbon nanotubes in water-saturated quartz sand as a function of tube length.",
        "Abstract": "A series of one-dimensional column experiments was conducted to examine the effects of tube length on the transport and deposition of 4-ethoxybenzoic acid functionalized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in water-saturated porous media. Aqueous MWCNTs suspensions were prepared to yield three distributions of tube lengths; 0.02-1.3 \u03bcm (short), 0.2-7.5 \u03bcm (medium), and 0.2-21.4 \u03bcm (long). Results of the column studies showed that MWCNT retention increased with increasing tube length. Nevertheless, more than 76% of the MWCNT mass delivered to the columns was detected in effluent samples under all experimental conditions, indicating that the functionalized MWCNTs were readily transported through 40-50 mesh Ottawa sand. Examination of MWCNT length distributions in the effluent samples revealed that nanotubes with lengths greater than 8 \u03bcm were preferentially deposited. In addition, measured retention profiles exhibited the greatest MWCNT deposition near the column inlet, which was most pronounced for the long MWCNTs, and decreased sharply with travel distance. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed that MWCNTs were deposited on sand surfaces over the entire column length, while larger MWCNT bundles were retained at grain intersections and near the column inlet. A mathematical model based on clean bed filtration theory (CBFT) was unable to accurately simulate the measured retention profile data, even after varying the weighting function and incorporating a nonuniform attachment rate coefficient expression. Modification of the mathematical model to account for physical straining greatly improved predictions of MWCNT retention, yielding straining rate coefficients that were four orders-of-magnitude greater than corresponding attachment rate coefficients. Taken in concert, these experimental and modeling results demonstrate the potential importance of, and need to consider, particle straining and tube length distribution when describing MWCNT transport in water-saturated porous media.",

        "Abstract": "The vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2; Slc18a2) packages monoamines into synaptic vesicles. Monoamine homeostasis is highly regulated and dysfunction may play a role in Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, drug addiction, and neuropsychiatric disorders. The primary function of VMAT2 is to sequester monoamine neurotransmitters into vesicles for subsequent release; it also sequesters toxicants away from cytosolic sites of action. Identification of compounds that modify the action of VMAT2 may be useful as therapeutic agents for preventing or reversing monoamine-related toxicity. Current methods for measuring VMAT2 function are unable to assess uptake in intact cells. Here, we adapted the Neurotransmitter Uptake Assay (Molecular Devices) to develop a measure of VMAT2 function in live whole cells. This assay contains a fluorescent compound, which is transported into cells by the plasma membrane monoamine transporters and has been marketed as a rapid, high-throughput, plate reader based assay for function of these plasma membrane transporters. We demonstrate a modified version of this assay that can be used to visualize and measure transport into vesicles by VMAT2. HEK293 cell lines stably expressing the dopamine transporter and a mCherry-VMAT2 fusion protein were generated. Confocal microscopy confirmed that the fluorescent compound is transported into mCherry-positive compartments. Furthermore, the VMAT2-specific inhibitor tetrabenazine (TBZ) blocks uptake into the mCherry-positive compartment. Confocal images can be analyzed to generate a measure of VMAT2 activity. In summary, we demonstrate a method for spatially resolved analysis of VMAT2-mediated uptake in live intact cells.",

While pesticides have repeatedly been identified as risk factors for PD, these compounds represent only a subset of environmental toxicants that we are exposed to on a regular basis. Thus, non-pesticide contaminants, such as metals, solvents, and other organohalogen compounds have also been implicated in the clinical and pathological manifestations of these movement disorders and it is these non-pesticide compounds that are the subject of this review. As toxic exposures to these classes of compounds can result in a spectrum of PD or PD-related disorders, it is imperative to appreciate shared clinico-pathological characteristics or mechanisms of action of these compounds in order to further delineate the resultant disorders as well as identify improved preventive strategies or therapeutic interventions.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine is transported into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2; SLC18A2). Disruption of dopamine storage has been hypothesized to damage the dopamine neurons that are lost in Parkinson's disease. By disrupting vesicular storage of dopamine and other monoamines, we have created a progressive mouse model of PD that exhibits catecholamine neuron loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta and locus coeruleus and motor and nonmotor symptoms. With a 95% reduction in VMAT2 expression, VMAT2-deficient animals have decreased motor function, progressive deficits in olfactory discrimination, shorter latency to behavioral signs of sleep, delayed gastric emptying, anxiety-like behaviors at younger ages, and a progressive depressive-like phenotype. Pathologically, the VMAT2-deficient mice display progressive neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra (SNpc), locus coeruleus (LC), and dorsal raphe (DR) coupled with \u03b1-synuclein accumulation. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that reduced vesicular storage of monoamines and the resulting disruption of the cytosolic environment may play a role in the pathogenesis of parkinsonian symptoms and neurodegeneration. The multisystem nature of the VMAT2-deficient mice may be useful in developing therapeutic strategies that go beyond the dopamine system.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, Huntington's chorea and drug addiction are manifestations of malfunctioning neurons within the striatum region at the base of the human forebrain. A key component of these neurons is the protein DARPP-32, which receives and processes various types of dopamine and glutamate inputs and translates them into specific biochemical, cellular, physiological, and behavioral responses. DARPP-32's unique capacity of faithfully converting distinct neurotransmitter signals into appropriate responses is achieved through a complex phosphorylation-dephosphorylation system that evades intuition and predictability.",

        "Abstract": "The article by Johnson et al. on the role of antioxidant signaling pathways in a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) merits further discussion. This group hypothesized that alterations in oxidative signaling may be involved in the development of EAE and multiple sclerosis (MS). Their laboratory has performed extensive characterization of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-antioxidant response element (Nrf2-ARE) pathway and the Nrf2 knockout mice. Building upon their previous studies, they have extended their characterization of the Nrf2-ARE system in an autoimmune inflammatory model of MS by crossing the Biozzi ABH mice with Nrf2 knockout mice. These hybrid mice allowed a direct test of their hypothesis and were crucial for the success of these studies. In this study, the authors demonstrate that the loss of Nrf2 exacerbates the development of EAE, suggesting that Nrf2 may represent a common pathway and that activation of Nrf2 may attenuate pathogenesis of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative movement disorder afflicting millions of people in the United States. The advent of transgenic technologies has contributed to the development of several new mouse models, many of which recapitulate some aspects of the disease; however, no model has been demonstrated to faithfully reproduce the full constellation of symptoms seen in human PD. This may be due in part to the narrow focus on the dopamine-mediated motor deficits. As current research continues to unmask PD as a multi-system disorder, animal models should similarly evolve to include the non-motor features of the disease. This requires that typically cited behavioral test batteries be expanded. The major non-motor symptoms observed in PD patients include hyposmia, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline. Mouse behavioral tests exist for all of these symptoms and while some models have begun to be reassessed for the prevalence of this broader behavioral phenotype, the majority has not. Moreover, all behavioral paradigms should be tested for their responsiveness to L-DOPA so these data can be compared to patient response and help elucidate which symptoms are likely not dopamine-mediated. Here, we suggest an extensive, yet feasible, battery of behavioral tests for mouse models of PD aimed to better assess both non-motor and motor deficits associated with the disease.",

However, BDNF has a poor pharmacokinetic profile that limits its therapeutic potential. Here we report the identification of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone as a bioactive high-affinity TrkB agonist that provokes receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling. 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone protected wild-type, but not TrkB-deficient, neurons from apoptosis. Administration of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone to mice activated TrkB in the brain, inhibited kainic acid-induced toxicity, decreased infarct volumes in stroke in a TrkB-dependent manner, and was neuroprotective in an animal model of Parkinson disease. Thus, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone imitates BDNF and acts as a robust TrkB agonist, providing a powerful therapeutic tool for the treatment of various neurological diseases.",

        "Title": "Effects of phenol on barrier function of a human intestinal epithelial cell line correlate with altered tight junction protein localization.",
        "Abstract": "Phenol contamination of soil and water has raised concerns among people living near phenol-producing factories and hazardous waste sites containing the chemical. Phenol, particularly in high concentrations, is an irritating and corrosive substance, making mucosal membranes targets of toxicity in humans. However, few data on the effects of phenol after oral exposure exist. We used an in vitro model employing human intestinal epithelial cells (SK-CO15) cultured on permeable supports to examine effects of phenol on epithelial barrier function. We hypothesized that phenol disrupts epithelial barrier by altering tight junction (TJ) protein expression. The dose-response effect of phenol on epithelial barrier function was determined using transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and FITC-dextran permeability measurements. We studied phenol-induced changes in cell morphology and expression of several tight junction proteins by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Effects on cell viability were assessed by MTT, Trypan blue, propidium iodide and TUNEL staining. Exposure to phenol resulted in decreased TER and increased paracellular flux of FITC-dextran in a dose-dependent manner. Delocalization of claudin-1 and ZO-1 from TJs to cytosol correlated with the observed increase in permeability after phenol treatment. Additionally, the decrease in TER correlated with changes in the distribution of a membrane raft marker, suggesting phenol-mediated effects on membrane fluidity. Such observations were independent of effects of phenol on cell viability as enhanced permeability occurred at doses of phenol that did not cause cell death. Overall, these findings suggest that phenol may affect transiently the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, thus destabilizing TJ-containing microdomains.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine signaling is involved in a number of brain pathways, and its disruption has been suggested to be involved in the several disease states, including Parkinson's disease (PD), schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It has been hypothesized that altered storage, release, and reuptake of dopamine contributes to both the hypo- and hyperdopaminergic states that exist in various diseases. Here, we use our recently described mathematical model of dopamine metabolism, combined with a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation analysis, to identify key determinants of dopamine metabolism associated with the dysregulation of dopamine homeostasis that may contribute to the pathogenesis of dopamine-based disorders. Our model reveals that the dopamine transporter (DAT), the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2), and the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) are the most influential components controlling the synaptic level of dopamine and the formation of toxic intracellular metabolites. The results are consistent with experimental observations and point to metabolic processes and combinations of processes that may be biochemical drivers of dopamine neuron degeneration. Since many of the identified components can be targeted therapeutically, the model may aid in the design of combined therapeutic regimens aimed at restoring proper dopamine signaling with toxic intermediates under control.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, culminating in severe motor symptoms, including resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. In addition to motor deficits, there are a variety of nonmotor symptoms associated with PD. These symptoms generally precede the onset of motor symptoms, sometimes by years, and include anosmia, problems with gastrointestinal motility, sleep disturbances, sympathetic denervation, anxiety, and depression. Previously, we have shown that mice with a 95% genetic reduction in vesicular monoamine transporter expression (VMAT2-deficient, VMAT2 LO) display progressive loss of striatal dopamine, L-DOPA-responsive motor deficits, alpha-synuclein accumulation, and nigral dopaminergic cell loss. We hypothesized that since these animals exhibit deficits in other monoamine systems (norepinephrine and serotonin), which are known to regulate some of these behaviors, the VMAT2-deficient mice may display some of the nonmotor symptoms associated with PD. Here we report that the VMAT2-deficient mice demonstrate progressive deficits in olfactory discrimination, delayed gastric emptying, altered sleep latency, anxiety-like behavior, and age-dependent depressive behavior. These results suggest that the VMAT2-deficient mice may be a useful model of the nonmotor symptoms of PD. Furthermore, monoamine dysfunction may contribute to many of the nonmotor symptoms of PD, and interventions aimed at restoring monoamine function may be beneficial in treating the disease.",

        "Title": "Protective actions of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in monoaminergic neurons.",
        "Abstract": "Vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) are responsible for the packaging of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine into synaptic vesicles. These proteins evolved from precursors in the major facilitator superfamily of transporters and are among the members of the toxin extruding antiporter family. While the primary function of VMATs is to sequester neurotransmitters within vesicles, they can also translocate toxicants away from cytosolic sites of action. In the case of dopamine, this dual role of VMAT2 is combined-dopamine is more readily oxidized in the cytosol where it can cause oxidative stress so packaging into vesicles serves two purposes: neurotransmission and neuroprotection. Furthermore, the deleterious effects of exogenous toxicants on dopamine neurons, such as MPTP, can be attenuated by VMAT2 activity. The active metabolite of MPTP can be kept within vesicles and prevented from disrupting mitochondrial function thereby sparing the dopamine neuron. The highly addictive drug methamphetamine is also neurotoxic to dopamine neurons by using dopamine itself to destroy the axon terminals. Methamphetamine interferes with vesicular sequestration and increases the production of dopamine, escalating the amount in the cytosol and leading to oxidative damage of terminal components. Vesicular transport seems to resist this process by sequestering much of the excess dopamine, which is illustrated by the enhanced methamphetamine neurotoxicity in VMAT2-deficient mice. It is increasingly evident that VMAT2 provides neuroprotection from both endogenous and exogenous toxicants and that while VMAT2 has been adapted by eukaryotes for synaptic transmission, it is derived from phylogenetically ancient proteins that originally evolved for the purpose of cellular protection.",

        "Abstract": "Computerized treadmill gait analysis in models of toxicant exposure and neurodegenerative disorders holds much potential for detection and therapeutic intervention in these models, and researchers must validate the technology that assists in that data collection and analysis. The present authors used a commercially available computerized gait analysis system that used (a) a motorized treadmill on retired breeder male C57BL/6J mice, (b) the toxicant-induced (1-methyl-1-, 2-, 3-, 6-tetrahydropyridine) MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD), and (c) the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) G93A transgenic mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The authors compared the detection of deficits by computerized treadmill gait analysis in MPTP-treated mice with inked-paw stride length and correlated these measures to dopamine (DA) loss. The authors found that the computerized treadmill gait analysis system did not distinguish MPTP-treated mice from vehicle controls, despite a nearly 90% deficit of striatal DA. In contrast, decreases in inked-paw stride length correlated strongly with DA losses in these same animals. Computerized treadmill gait analysis could neither reliably distinguish SOD1 G93A mutant mice from controls from 6 to 12 weeks of age nor detect any consistent early motor deficits in these mice. On the basis of the authors' findings, they inferred that computerized gait analysis on a motorized treadmill is not suited to measuring motor deficits in either the MPTP mouse model of PD or the SOD1 G93A mouse model of ALS.",

        "Title": "Reduced vesicular storage of dopamine exacerbates methamphetamine-induced neurodegeneration and astrogliosis.",
        "Abstract": "The vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) controls the loading of dopamine (DA) into vesicles and therefore determines synaptic properties such as quantal size, receptor sensitivity, and vesicular and cytosolic DA concentration. Impairment of proper DA compartmentalization is postulated to underlie the sensitivity of DA neurons to oxidative damage and degeneration. It is known that DA can auto-oxidize in the cytosol to form quinones and other oxidative species and that this production of oxidative stress is thought to be a critical factor in DA terminal loss after methamphetamine (METH) exposure. Using a mutant strain of mice (VMAT2 LO), which have only 5-10% of the VMAT2 expressed by wild-type animals, we show that VMAT2 is a major determinant of METH toxicity in the striatum. Subsequent to METH exposure, the VMAT2 LO mice show an exacerbated loss of dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), as well as enhanced astrogliosis and protein carbonyl formation. More importantly, VMAT2 LO mice show massive argyrophilic deposits in the striatum after METH, indicating that VMAT2 is a regulator of METH-induced neurodegeneration. The increased METH neurotoxicity in VMAT2 LO occurs in the absence of any significant difference in basal temperature or METH-induced hyperthermia. Furthermore, primary midbrain cultures from VMAT2 LO mice show more oxidative stress generation and a greater loss of TH positive processes than wild-type cultures after METH exposure. Elevated markers of neurotoxicity in VMAT2 LO mice and cultures suggest that the capacity to store DA determines the amount of oxidative stress and neurodegeneration after METH administration.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily thought of as a disease of aging. However, recent evidence points to the potential for exposure to xenobiotics during development to increase risk of PD. Here, we report that developmental exposure to the organochlorine pesticide heptachlor alters the dopamine system and increases neurotoxicity in an animal model of PD. Exposure of pregnant mice to heptachlor led to increased levels of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) levels at both the protein and mRNA level in their offspring. Increased DAT and VMAT2 levels were accompanied by alterations of mRNA levels of nuclear transcription factors that control dopamine neuron development and regulate DAT and VMAT2 levels in adulthood. At 12 weeks of age, control and heptachlor-exposed offspring were administered a moderate dose (2 x 10mg/kg) of the parkinsonism-inducing agent MPTP. Greater neurotoxicity as evidenced by a greater loss of striatal dopamine and potentiation of increased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein and alpha-synuclein was observed in heptachlor-exposed offspring. The neurotoxicity observed was greater in the male offspring than the female offspring, suggesting that males are more susceptible to the long-term effects of developmental heptachlor exposure. These data suggest that developmental heptachlor exposure causes long-term alterations of the dopamine system thereby rendering it more susceptible to dopaminergic damage in adulthood.",

        "Abstract": "A prominent feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the loss of dopamine in the striatum, and many therapeutic interventions for the disease are aimed at restoring dopamine signaling. Dopamine signaling includes the synthesis, storage, release, and recycling of dopamine in the presynaptic terminal and activation of pre- and post-synaptic receptors and various downstream signaling cascades. As an aid that might facilitate our understanding of dopamine dynamics in the pathogenesis and treatment in PD, we have begun to merge currently available information and expert knowledge regarding presynaptic dopamine homeostasis into a computational model, following the guidelines of biochemical systems theory. After subjecting our model to mathematical diagnosis and analysis, we made direct comparisons between model predictions and experimental observations and found that the model exhibited a high degree of predictive capacity with respect to genetic and pharmacological changes in gene expression or function. Our results suggest potential approaches to restoring the dopamine imbalance and the associated generation of oxidative stress. While the proposed model of dopamine metabolism is preliminary, future extensions and refinements may eventually serve as an in silico platform for prescreening potential therapeutics, identifying immediate side effects, screening for biomarkers, and assessing the impact of risk factors of the disease.",

        "Title": "The effects of environmental neurotoxicants on the dopaminergic system: A possible role in drug addiction.",
        "Abstract": "Humans are routinely exposed to a vast array of environmental neurotoxicants, including pesticides, endocrine disrupters, and heavy metals. The long-term consequences of exposure have become a major human health concern as research has indicated strong associations between neurotoxicants and a variety of dopamine-related neurological disorders. Developmental exposure to pesticides including paraquat, organochlorines, and rotenone produce alterations in the dopaminergic system and has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. Endocrine disrupters such as Bisphenol A, mimic estrogenic activity and impact various dopaminergic processes to enhance mesolimbic dopamine activity resulting in hyperactivity, attention deficits, and a heightened sensitivity to drugs of abuse. A second class of endocrine disrupters, the polychlorinated biphenyls, may act directly on dopaminergic processes to disrupt the dopamine system and produce Parkinson-like symptoms. Exposure to the heavy metal lead enhances dopaminergic activity and has been associated with attention deficits, Alzheimer's disease, and increased drug sensitivity. Manganese exposure, in contrast, results in dopamine deficiencies and Parkinson-like symptoms. Therefore, this commentary will discuss the effects and consequences that exposure to these three classes of environmental neurotoxicants have on the dopamine system and related behaviors and disorders. Finally, the recent hypothesis that exposure to environmental compounds which have effects on dopaminergic neurotransmission, including 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, Bisphenol A, and multiple heavy metals, may potentiate drug-induced behaviors and increase the brain's vulnerability to drug addiction will be discussed.",

        "Title": "Disruption of dopamine transport by DDT and its metabolites.",
        "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies suggest a link between pesticide exposure and an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). Although studies have been unable to clearly identify specific pesticides that contribute to PD, a few human studies have reported higher levels of the organochlorine pesticides dieldrin and DDE (a metabolite of DDT) in post-mortem PD brains. Previously, we found that exposure of mice to dieldrin caused perturbations in the nigrostriatal dopamine system consistent with those seen in PD. Given the concern over the environmental persistence and reintroduction of DDT for the control of malaria-carrying mosquitoes and other pests, we sought to determine whether DDT and its two major metabolites, DDD and DDE, could damage the dopamine system. In vitro analyses in mouse synaptosomes and vesicles demonstrated that DDT and its metabolites inhibit the plasma membrane dopamine transporter (DAT) and the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2). However, exposure of mice to either DDT or DDE failed to show evidence of nigrostriatal damage or behavioral abnormalities in any of the measures examined. Thus, we report that in vitro effects of DDT and its metabolites on components of the dopamine system do not translate into neurotoxicological outcomes in orally exposed mice and DDT appears to have less dopamine toxicity when compared to dieldrin. These data suggest elevated DDE levels in PD patients may represent a measure of general pesticide exposure and that other pesticides may be responsible for the association between pesticide exposure and PD.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine is a potentially toxic neurotransmitter that has long been speculated to contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent work has demonstrated the importance of proper storage of dopamine in vesicles to maintain dopamine homeostasis, thus protecting neurons from the detrimental effects of dopamine accumulation and breakdown in the cytosol. These studies suggest that factors which affect dopamine storage might increase the susceptibility of dopamine neurons to further environmental or genetic insults, exacerbating the neuronal degeneration that characterizes PD. This review seeks to revisit the pathogenicity of cytosolic dopamine and further address the critical role of neurotransmitter storage in dopamine-mediated neurotoxicity.",

        "Abstract": "Environmental factors have been shown to contribute to the incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD). Pesticides, which represent one of the primary classes of environmental agents associated with PD, share the common feature of being intentionally released into the environment to control or eliminate pests. Pesticides consist of multiple classes and subclasses of insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides, fungicides, fumigants and others and exhibit a vast array of chemically diverse structures. In this review we examine the evidence regarding the ability of each of the major pesticide subclasses to increase the incidence of PD. We propose that, from a toxicological perspective, it would be beneficial to identify specific subclasses, common structural features and the propensity for widespread human exposure when considering the potential role in PD, rather than using the overly broad term of 'pesticides' to describe this diverse group of chemicals. Furthermore, these chemicals and their environmentally relevant combinations should be evaluated for their ability to promote or accelerate PD and not merely for being singular causative agents.",

        "Abstract": "The vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2; SLC18A2) is responsible for packaging dopamine into vesicles for subsequent release and has been suggested to serve a neuroprotective role in the dopamine system. Here, we show that mice that express approximately 5% of normal VMAT2 (VMAT2 LO) display age-associated nigrostriatal dopamine dysfunction that ultimately results in neurodegeneration. Elevated cysteinyl adducts to L-DOPA and DOPAC are seen early and are followed by increased striatal protein carbonyl and 3-nitrotyrosine formation. These changes were associated with decreased striatal dopamine and decreased expression of the dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase. Furthermore, we observed an increase in alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity and accumulation and neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra pars compacta in aged VMAT2 LO mice. Thus, VMAT2 LO animals display nigrostriatal degeneration that begins in the terminal fields and progresses to eventual loss of the cell bodies, alpha-synuclein accumulation, and an L-DOPA responsive behavioral deficit, replicating many of the key aspects of Parkinson's disease. These data suggest that mishandling of dopamine via reduced VMAT2 expression is, in and of itself, sufficient to cause dopamine-mediated toxicity and neurodegeneration in the nigrostriatal dopamine system. In addition, the altered dopamine homeostasis resulting from reduced VMAT2 function may be conducive to pathogenic mechanisms induced by genetic or environmental factors thought to be involved in Parkinson's disease.",

We examined the effects of genetic deletion and pharmacologic blockade of PAR1 in the mouse 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by nigrostriatal dopamine damage and gliosis. After MPTP injection, PAR1-/- mice showed significantly higher residual levels of dopamine, dopamine transporter, and tyrosine hydroxylase and diminished microgliosis compared with wild-type mice. Comparable levels of dopaminergic neuroprotection from MPTP-induced toxicity were obtained by infusion of the PAR1 antagonist, BMS-200261 into the right lateral cerebral ventricle. MPTP administration caused changes in the brain protease system, including increased levels of mRNA for two PAR1 activators, matrix metalloprotease-1 and Factor Xa, suggesting a mechanism by which MPTP administration could lead to overactivation of PAR1. We also report that PAR1 is expressed in human substantia nigra pars compacta glia as well as tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons. Together, these data suggest that PAR1 might be a target for therapeutic intervention in Parkinson's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in the gene for DJ-1 have been associated with early-onset autosomal recessive parkinsonism. Previous studies of null DJ-1 mice have shown alterations in striatal dopamine (DA) transmission with no DAergic cell loss. Here we characterize a new line of DJ-1-deficient mice. A subtle locomotor deficit was present in the absence of a change in striatal DA levels. However, increased [(3)H]-DA synaptosomal uptake and [(125)I]-RTI-121 binding were measured in null DJ-1 vs. wild-type mice. Western analyses of synaptosomes revealed significantly higher dopamine transporter (DAT) levels in pre-synaptic membrane fractions. 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) exposure exacerbated striatal DA depletion in null DJ-1 mice with no difference in DAergic nigral cell loss. Furthermore, increased 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) synaptosomal uptake and enhanced MPP(+) accumulation were measured in DJ-1-deficient vs. control striatum. Thus, under null DJ-1 conditions, DAT changes likely contribute to altered DA neurotransmission and enhanced sensitivity to toxins that utilize DAT for nigrostriatal entry.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the genetic reduction of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) on voluntary ethanol consumption and conditioned place preference (CPP) using VMAT2 heterozygote knockout mice [VMAT2(+/-)]. Ethanol preference and consumption were assessed in a two-bottle choice procedure, and rewarding properties of ethanol were determined using a CPP paradigm. In the two-bottle choice VMAT2(+/-) male mice exhibited a decreased preference for and consumption of ethanol at all concentrations tested, as compared to their wild-type littermates. While female mice consumed more ethanol than male mice, there was no difference between the wild type and VMAT2(+/-). In the CPP experiment, wild-type mice exhibited place preference for the ethanol-paired environment while neither male or female VMAT2(+/-) mice developed place preference. Wild type and VMAT2(+/-) mice did not differ in blood ethanol metabolism and sensitivity to the depressant effects of ethanol. These data demonstrate that a reduction of VMAT2 expression reduces ethanol consumption in male mice and eliminates place preference in heterozygote mice of both sexes and suggests that altered VMAT2 expression may contribute to the rewarding properties of ethanol.",

        "Abstract": "Numerous epidemiological studies have shown an association between pesticide exposure and an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we provide evidence that the insecticide dieldrin causes specific oxidative damage in the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) system. We report that exposure of mice to low levels of dieldrin for 30 days resulted in alterations in dopamine-handling as evidenced by a decrease in dopamine metabolites, DOPAC (31.7% decrease) and HVA (29.2% decrease) and significantly increased cysteinyl-catechol levels in the striatum. Furthermore, dieldrin resulted in a 53% decrease in total glutathione, an increase in the redox potential of glutathione, and a 90% increase in protein carbonyls. Alpha-synuclein protein expression was also significantly increased in the striatum (25% increase). Finally, dieldrin caused a significant decrease in striatal expression of the dopamine transporter as measured by (3)H-WIN 35,428 binding and (3)H-dopamine uptake. These alterations occurred in the absence of dopamine neuron loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta. These effects represent the ability of low doses of dieldrin to increase the vulnerability of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons by inducing oxidative stress and suggest that pesticide exposure may act as a promoter of PD.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and pesticide exposure. The pesticide rotenone (ROT) inhibits complex I and reproduces features of PD in animal models, suggesting that environmental agents that inhibit complex I may contribute to PD. We have previously demonstrated that ROT toxicity is dependent upon complex I inhibition and that oxidative stress is the primary mechanism of toxicity. In this study, we examined the in vitro toxicity and mechanism of action of several putative complex I inhibitors that are commonly used as pesticides. The rank order of toxicity of pesticides to neuroblastoma cells was pyridaben > rotenone > fenpyroximate > fenazaquin > tebunfenpyrad. A similar order of potency was observed for reduction of ATP levels and competition for (3)H-dihydrorotenone (DHR) binding to complex I, with the exception of pyridaben (PYR). Neuroblastoma cells stably expressing the ROT-insensitive NADH dehydrogenase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NDI1) were resistant to these pesticides, demonstrating the requirement of complex I inhibition for toxicity. We further found that PYR was a more potent inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration and caused more oxidative damage than ROT. The oxidative damage could be attenuated by NDI1 or by the antioxidants alpha-tocopherol and coenzyme Q(10). PYR was also highly toxic to midbrain organotypic slices. These data demonstrate that, in addition to ROT, several commercially used pesticides directly inhibit complex I, cause oxidative damage, and suggest that further study is warranted into environmental agents that inhibit complex I for their potential role in PD.",

        "Title": "Obligatory role for complex I inhibition in the dopaminergic neurotoxicity of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).",
        "Abstract": "Administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to mice and nonhuman primates causes a parkinsonian disorder characterized by a loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra and corresponding motor deficits. MPTP has been proposed to exert its neurotoxic effects through a variety of mechanisms, including inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, displacement of dopamine from vesicular stores, and formation of reactive oxygen species from mitochondrial or cytosolic sources. However, the mechanism of MPTP-induced neurotoxicity is still a matter of debate. Recently, we reported that the yeast single-subunit nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced) dehydrogenase (NDI1) is resistant to rotenone, a complex I inhibitor that produces a parkinsonian syndrome in rats, and that overexpression of NDI1 in SK-N-MC cells prevents the toxicity of rotenone. In this study, we used viral-mediated overexpression of NDI1 in SK-N-MC cells and animals to determine the relative contribution of complex I inhibition in the toxicity of MPTP. In cell culture, NDI1 overexpression abolished the toxicity of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, the active metabolite of MPTP. Overexpression of NDI1 through stereotactic administration of a viral vector harboring the NDI1 gene into the substantia nigra protected mice from both the neurochemical and behavioral deficits elicited by MPTP. These data identify inhibition of complex I as a requirement for dopaminergic neurodegeneration and subsequent behavioral deficits produced by MPTP. Furthermore, combined with reports of a complex I defect in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, the present study affirms the utility of MPTP in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD.",

        "Abstract": "Paraquat, N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine, and rotenone have been shown to reproduce several features of Parkinson's disease in animal and cell culture models. Although these chemicals are known to perturb dopamine homeostasis and induce dopaminergic cell death, their molecular mechanisms of action are not well defined. We have previously shown that paraquat does not require functional dopamine transporter and does not inhibit mitochondrial complex I in order to mediate its toxic action (Richardson et al., 2005). In this study, we show that paraquat specifically oxidized the cytosolic form of thioredoxin and activated Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), followed by caspase-3 activation. Conversely, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) and rotenone oxidized the mitochondrial form of thioredoxin but did not activate JNK-mitogen-activated protein kinase and caspase-3. Loading cells with exogenous dopamine did not exacerbate the toxicity of any of these compounds. These data suggest that oxidative modification of cytosolic proteins is critical to paraquat toxicity, while oxidation of mitochondrial proteins is important for MPP(+) and rotenone toxicity. In addition, intracellular dopamine does not seem to exacerbate the toxicity of these dopaminergic neurotoxicants in this model.",

        "Abstract": "Exposure to pesticides has been suggested to increase the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the mechanisms responsible for this association are not clear. Here, we report that perinatal exposure of mice during gestation and lactation to low levels of dieldrin (0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg every 3 days) alters dopaminergic neurochemistry in their offspring and exacerbates MPTP toxicity. At 12 wk of age, protein and mRNA levels of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) were increased by perinatal dieldrin exposure in a dose-related manner. We then administered MPTP (2 x 10 mg/kg s.c) at 12 wk of age and observed a greater reduction of striatal dopamine in dieldrin-exposed offspring, which was associated with a greater DAT:VMAT2 ratio. Additionally, dieldrin exposure during development potentiated the increase in GFAP and alpha-synuclein levels induced by MPTP, indicating increased neurotoxicity. In all cases there were greater effects observed in the male offspring than the female, similar to that observed in human cases of PD. These data suggest that developmental exposure to dieldrin leads to persistent alterations of the developing dopaminergic system and that these alterations induce a \"silent\" state of dopamine dysfunction, thereby rendering dopamine neurons more vulnerable later in life.",

        "Abstract": "Previous pharmacological studies have implicated dopamine as a modulator of olfactory bulb processing. Several disorders characterized by altered dopamine homeostasis in olfaction-related brain regions display olfactory deficits. To further characterize the role of dopamine in olfactory processing, we subjected dopamine transporter knockout mice (DAT -/-) and dopamine receptor 2 knockout mice (D2 -/-) to a battery of olfactory tests. In addition to behavioral characterization, several neurochemical markers of olfactory bulb integrity and function were examined. DAT -/- mice displayed an olfactory discrimination deficit, but did not differ detectably from DAT wildtype (DAT +/+) mice in odor habituation, olfactory sensitivity, or odor recognition memory. Neurochemically, DAT -/- mice have decreased D2 receptor staining in the periglomerular layer of the olfactory bulb and increased tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity compared to DAT +/+ controls. D2 -/- mice exhibited the same olfactory deficit as the DAT -/- mice, further supporting the role of dopamine at the D2 synapse in olfactory discrimination processing. The findings presented in this paper reinforce the functional significance of dopamine and more specifically the D2 receptor in olfactory discrimination and may help explain the behavioral phenotype in the DAT and D2 knockout mice.",

        "Abstract": "Epidemiological and laboratory studies have suggested that exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may be a risk factor for Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential mechanisms by which PCBs may disrupt normal functioning of the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) system. We utilized an environmentally relevant exposure of PCBs (7.5 or 15 mg/kg/day Aroclor 1,254:1,260 for 30 days by oral gavage) to identify early signs of damage to the DA system. This dosing regimen, which resulted in PCB levels similar to those found in human brain samples, did not cause overt degeneration to the DA system as shown by a lack of change in striatal DA levels or tyrosine hydroxylase levels. However, we did observe a dramatic dose-dependent decrease in striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) levels. The observed reductions appear to be specific to the DAT populations located in the striatum, as no change was observed in other dopaminergic brain regions or to other neurotransmitter transporters present in the striatum. These data demonstrate that PCB tissue concentrations similar to those found in postmortem human brain specifically disrupt DA transport, which acts as a precursor to subsequent damage to the DA system. Furthermore, DAT imaging may be useful in evaluating alterations in brain function in human populations exposed to PCBs.",

        "Abstract": "Early in Parkinson's disease (PD) physical activity becomes difficult resulting in a more sedentary lifestyle. Clinical and experimental studies have found that increased activity following striatal dopamine loss leads to increased motor function. Decreased physical activity early in PD along with findings that increased physical activity results in functional improvement suggested to us that decreased physical activity during the period of nigrostriatal degeneration may not only be a symptom of the injury, but may also act to potentiate the degeneration. Using the bilateral MPTP mouse model of PD, we restricted use of one forelimb for the first 7 days post-injection. This transient behavioral manipulation during the period of dopamine degeneration resulted in a long-lasting deficit of the restricted forelimb. This was manifested as sustained asymmetrical use of the forelimbs during wall exploration, as well as a neurochemical imbalance between striatal hemispheres measured by immunoreactivity of the dopamine terminal markers, DAT, VMAT2 and TH. These results show a significant interaction between behavior and neurochemistry and suggest that a reduction in activity level may further exacerbate degeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Paraquat, MPTP, and rotenone reproduce features of Parkinson's disease (PD) in experimental animals. The exact mechanisms by which these compounds damage the dopamine system are not firmly established, but selective damage to dopamine neurons and inhibition of complex I are thought to be involved. We and others have previously documented that the toxic metabolite of MPTP, MPP+, is transported into dopamine neurons through the dopamine transporter (DAT), while rotenone is not transported by DAT. We have also demonstrated the requirement for complex I inhibition and oxidative damage in the dopaminergic neurodegeneration produced by rotenone. Based on structural similarity to MPP+, it has been proposed that paraquat exerts selective dopaminergic toxicity through transport by the DAT and subsequent inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. In this study we report that paraquat is neither a substrate nor inhibitor of DAT. We also demonstrate that in vivo exposure to MPTP and rotenone, but not paraquat, inhibits binding of 3H-dihydrorotenone to complex I in brain mitochondria. Rotenone and MPP+ were both effective inhibitors of complex I activity in isolated brain mitochondria, while paraquat exhibited weak inhibitory effects only at millimolar concentrations. These data indicate that, despite the apparent structural similarity to MPP+, paraquat exerts its deleterious effects on dopamine neurons in a manner that is unique from rotenone and MPTP.",

        "Abstract": "Although banned in the 1970s, significant levels of the organochlorine pesticide heptachlor are still present in the environment raising concern over potential human exposure. In particular, organochlorine pesticides have been linked to an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. Studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that exposure of laboratory animals to heptachlor alters the levels and function of the dopamine transporter (DAT), an integral component of dopaminergic neurotransmission and a gateway for the dopaminergic neurotoxin MPTP. In this study, we examined the effects of developmental exposure to heptachlor on DAT, and other key components of the dopaminergic system, including the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). Female C57BL/6J mice received 0 or 3mg/kg heptachlor in peanut butter every 3 days for 2 weeks prior to breeding and throughout gestation and lactation until the offspring were weaned on postnatal day (PND) 21. On postnatal day 28, DAT, VMAT2, and TH levels were increased by 100, 70, and 30%, respectively, with no change in AADC levels or total dopamine levels. The ratio of DAT:VMAT2 was increased 29%. Since an increase in the DAT:VMAT2 ratio appears to predict susceptibility of brain regions to Parkinson's disease (PD) and results in increased toxicity of MPTP, these results suggest that alterations of the dopaminergic system by developmental heptachlor exposure may increase the susceptibility of dopamine neurons to toxic insult.",

        "Title": "Pyrethroid pesticide-induced alterations in dopamine transporter function.",
        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between pesticide exposure and the incidence of PD. Studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that certain pesticides increase levels of the dopamine transporter (DAT), an integral component of dopaminergic neurotransmission and a gateway for dopaminergic neurotoxins. Here, we report that repeated exposure (3 injections over 2 weeks) of mice to two commonly used pyrethroid pesticides, deltamethrin (3 mg/kg) and permethrin (0.8 mg/kg), increases DAT-mediated dopamine uptake by 31 and 28%, respectively. Using cells stably expressing DAT, we determined that exposure (10 min) to deltamethrin and permethrin (1 nM-100 microM) had no effect on DAT-mediated dopamine uptake. Extending exposures to both pesticides for 30 min (10 microM) or 24 h (1, 5, and 10 microM) resulted in significant decrease in dopamine uptake. This reduction was not the result of competitive inhibition, loss of DAT protein, or cytotoxicity. However, there was an increase in DNA fragmentation, an index of apoptosis, in cells exhibiting reduced uptake at 30 min and 24 h. These data suggest that up-regulation of DAT by in vivo pyrethroid exposure is an indirect effect and that longer-term exposure of cells results in apoptosis. Since DAT can greatly affect the vulnerability of dopamine neurons to neurotoxicants, up-regulation of DAT by deltamethrin and permethrin may increase the susceptibility of dopamine neurons to toxic insult, which may provide insight into the association between pesticide exposure and PD.",

        "Abstract": "Changes in synaptic activity alter quantal size, but the relative roles of presynaptic and postsynaptic cells in these changes are only beginning to be understood. We examined the mechanism underlying increased quantal size after block of synaptic activity at the mammalian neuromuscular junction in vivo. We found that changes in neither acetylcholinesterase activity nor acetylcholine receptor density could account for the increase. By elimination, it appears likely that the site of increased quantal size after chronic block of activity is presynaptic and involves increased release of acetylcholine. We used mice with muscle hyperexcitability caused by mutation of the ClC-1 muscle chloride channel to examine the role of postsynaptic activity in controlling quantal size. Surprisingly, quantal size was increased in ClC mice before block of synaptic activity. We examined the mechanism underlying increased quantal size in ClC mice and found that it also appeared to be located presynaptically. When presynaptic activity was completely blocked in both control and ClC mice, quantal size was large in both groups despite the higher level of postsynaptic activity in ClC mice. This suggests that postsynaptic activity does not regulate quantal size at the neuromuscular junction. We propose that presynaptic activity modulates quantal size at the neuromuscular junction by modulating the amount of acetylcholine released from vesicles.",

        "Abstract": "The noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC) are damaged in Parkinson's disease (PD). Neurotoxin ablation of the LC noradrenergic neurons has been shown to exacerbate the dopaminergic toxicity of MPTP, suggesting that the noradrenergic system protects dopamine neurons. We utilized mice that exhibit elevated synaptic noradrenaline (NA) by genetically deleting the noradrenaline transporter (NET), a key regulator of the noradrenergic system (NET KO mice). NET KO and wild-type littermates were administered MPTP and striatal dopamine terminal integrity was assessed by HPLC of monoamines, immmunoblotting for dopaminergic markers and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry. MPTP significantly reduced striatal dopamine in wild-type mice, but not in the NET KO mice. To confirm that the protection observed in the NET KO mice was due to the lack of NET, we treated wild-type mice with the specific NET inhibitor, nisoxetine, and then challenged them with MPTP. Nisoxetine conferred protection to the dopaminergic system. These data indicate that NA can modulate MPTP toxicity and suggest that manipulation of the noradrenergic system may have therapeutic value in PD.",

        "Abstract": "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been shown to specifically target the dopaminergic nervous system, resulting in long-term reduction of striatal dopamine (DA) levels. However, the mechanism(s) by which PCBs exert this effect is not known. Here we report that decreased striatal dopamine levels are observed 1, 7, and 14 days after acute exposure to the common PCB mixtures Aroclor 1016 or 1260. Dopamine transporter (DAT) levels were decreased at all time points in Aroclor 1016 treated animals, and on Days 1 and 7 in Aroclor 1260 treated animals. Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) levels were not affected by Aroclor 1016, but were significantly decreased 14 days after exposure to Aroclor 1260. Tyrosine hydroxylase expression, a marker of dopamine neuron integrity, was not significantly affected by PCB exposure at any time. These data suggest that PCB-induced reductions in striatal dopamine may be mediated by alterations in DAT and VMAT2 expression.",

        "Title": "Mechanism of toxicity in rotenone models of Parkinson's disease.",
        "Abstract": "Exposure of rats to the pesticide and complex I inhibitor rotenone reproduces features of Parkinson's disease, including selective nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration and alpha-synuclein-positive cytoplasmic inclusions (Betarbet et al., 2000; Sherer et al., 2003). Here, we examined mechanisms of rotenone toxicity using three model systems. In SK-N-MC human neuroblastoma cells, rotenone (10 nm to 1 microm) caused dose-dependent ATP depletion, oxidative damage, and death. To determine the molecular site of action of rotenone, cells were transfected with the rotenone-insensitive single-subunit NADH dehydrogenase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NDI1), which incorporates into the mammalian ETC and acts as a \"replacement\" for endogenous complex I. In response to rotenone, NDI1-transfected cells did not show mitochondrial impairment, oxidative damage, or death, demonstrating that these effects of rotenone were caused by specific interactions at complex I. Although rotenone caused modest ATP depletion, equivalent ATP loss induced by 2-deoxyglucose was without toxicity, arguing that bioenergetic defects were not responsible for cell death. In contrast, reducing oxidative damage with antioxidants, or by NDI1 transfection, blocked cell death. To determine the relevance of rotenone-induced oxidative damage to dopaminergic neuronal death, we used a chronic midbrain slice culture model. In this system, rotenone caused oxidative damage and dopaminergic neuronal loss, effects blocked by alpha-tocopherol. Finally, brains from rotenone-treated animals demonstrated oxidative damage, most notably in midbrain and olfactory bulb, dopaminergic regions affected by Parkinson's disease. These results, using three models of increasing complexity, demonstrate the involvement of oxidative damage in rotenone toxicity and support the evaluation of antioxidant therapies for Parkinson's disease.",

In this paper, we describe a simple and inexpensive test that measures long-term behavioral deficits in mice treated with moderate doses of MPTP. These measures are significantly correlated with the loss of striatal dopamine and immunoreactivity of the dopamine transporter, vesicular monoamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase.

Following injury, the brain is sensitive to reorganization and regeneration, and thus may be primed for influence by external behavioral demand such as increased use of an injured forelimb.

        "Abstract": "Overt behavioral symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) do not occur until over 80% of the striatal dopamine content has been lost. Diagnosis of the disorder relies on identifying clinical symptoms including akinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity. In retrospect, behavioral deficits are observed several years prior to diagnosis. Behavioral manifestations in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD, such as changes in general locomotor activity and rotorod performance, require large doses of MPTP and are often transient. We hypothesized that, as in PD, subtle behavioral changes also occur in the MPTP model. In this paper, we demonstrate that mice treated with moderate doses of the dopaminergic toxin MPTP display deficits in behavioral parameters that are significantly correlated with the loss of striatal dopamine. In addition, these behavioral measures are correlated to dopamine transporter, vesicular monoamine transporter, and tyrosine hydroxylase expression and are improved following L-DOPA administration. Detection of dopamine-modulated behavioral changes in moderately depleted MPTP mice will allow for more efficacious use of this model in PD research.",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies indicate that reserpine may disrupt dopamine transporter activity. Results presented herein reveal that it also inhibits potently synaptosomal [3H]dopamine uptake. In addition, reserpine administration to rats decreased the V(max) of synaptosomal dopamine transport, as assessed ex vivo 12 h after treatment. This decrease appeared, at least in part, dissociated from concurrent inhibition of the vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2). In separate experiments, synaptosomal dopamine uptake did not differ between wild-type and heterozygous VMAT-2 knockout mice, and reserpine treatment did not inhibit [3H]dopamine uptake into cells heterogously expressing the human dopamine transporter. Taken together, these data suggest that reserpine may transiently alter dopamine transporter function in a noncompetitive, indirect manner.",

        "Abstract": "One of the most useful treatments of Parkinson's disease (PD) is dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) administration. However, L-DOPA has been suggested to be toxic to dopamine (DA) neurons and perhaps contribute to the progression of the disease. Sequestration of DA and dopaminergic neurotoxins into vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is a key factor in preventing cellular damage. Mice with reduced expression of VMAT2 (VMAT2 heterozygote knockout mice; VMAT2 (+/-)) are more sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and methamphetamine. In this study, we subjected VMAT2 (+/-) mice to subchronic administration of L-DOPA to determine if it was toxic in this model. VMAT2 wild-type (VMAT2 (+/+)) and VMAT2 (+/-) mice were given i.p. injections of L-DOPA:carbidopa (50:5 mg/kg) three times a day for 28 days. Biochemical analysis revealed a significant increase in striatal DA levels in both groups of mice treated with L-DOPA. L-DOPA treatment significantly decreased DAT levels in VMAT2 (+/+) mice, but not in VMAT2 (+/-) mice. VMAT2 protein levels, an index of terminal integrity and the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive nigral cells remained unchanged after L-DOPA treatment. These data indicate that in an animal model that displays increased susceptibility to dopaminergic injury, a subchronic administration of L-DOPA does not induce toxicity.",

        "Abstract": "At low micromolar concentrations, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), the toxic metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) selectively kills nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons by mechanisms believed to involve impairment of mitochondrial complex I. A human neuroblastoma cell line expressing the dopamine transporter (DAT) was utilized to examine the effects of MPP+ on acute physiologic responses and subsequent cell death. Acute responses were measured by microphysiometry and by monitoring mitochondrial membrane potential with [3H]tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) uptake. MPP+ (10 microM) increased extracellular proton excretion in DAT-expressing cells within 2-3 min, but had no effect in untransfected cells. The lipophilic complex I inhibitor, rotenone, increased proton excretion in both cell lines. In DAT-expressing cells, mitochondrial membrane potential was reduced within I h of 10 microM MPP+ exposure. Rotenone reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in both cell lines. MPP+ caused apoptotic death of DAT-transfected cells 2-3 days after drug application, but did not kill untransfected cells. Thus, MPP+ produces immediate mitochondrial impairment only in cells that express DAT, and these changes occur days before overt cellular toxicity. The magnitude, time course and nature of these changes were similar to those produced by rotenone, confirming the site of action of MPP+ as mitochondrial complex I.

        "Abstract": "Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is based on the presentation of clinical symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity. However, one feature of PD that often begins years before diagnosis is decreased physical activity. We hypothesized that this depressed activity is not only a symptom of the early dopaminergic loss but also a catalyst in the degenerative process. Two experiments were performed to test this hypothesis. First, rats were exposed to a mild dose of 6-hydroxydopamine unilaterally into the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) projections, which would normally result in an approximately 20% DA loss and no detectable behavioral asymmetries. A subset of these lesioned animals then had a cast applied for 7 d to the contralateral forelimb. After the cast was removed, these animals displayed long-term behavioral asymmetry and exacerbation of neurochemical loss (approximately 60% depletion). Second, a group of animals received a high dose of 6-hydroxydopamine that normally would yield a severe loss of nigrostriatal terminals (approximately 90% loss) and chronic sensorimotor deficits. During the first 7 d after neurotoxin exposure, a subset of these animals were forced to rely on the contralateral forelimb, a procedure we have previously reported to protect DA terminals and behavioral function. Some of these rats then had the use of their \"recovered\" forelimb restricted during the second or third week after lesioning. This precipitated a severe and chronic loss of DA terminals and functional deficits. These results suggest decreased physical activity not only is a symptom of PD but also may act to potentiate the underlying degeneration.",
