        "Abstract": "Severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has been associated with fibrin-mediated hypercoagulability and thromboembolic complications. To evaluate potential biomarkers of coagulopathy and disease severity in COVID-19, we measured plasma levels of eight biomarkers potentially associated with coagulation, fibrinolysis, and platelet function in 43 controls and 63 COVID-19 patients, including 47 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 16 non-ICU patients. COVID-19 patients showed significantly elevated levels of fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), and its inhibitor plasminogen activation inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), as well as ST2 (the receptor for interleukin-33) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) compared to the control group. We found that higher levels of t-PA, ST2, and vWF at the time of admission were associated with lower survival rates, and that thrombotic events were more frequent in patients with initial higher levels of vWF. These results support a predictive role of specific biomarkers such as t-PA and vWF in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. The data provide support for the case that hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is fibrin-mediated, but also highlights the important role that vWF may play in the genesis of thromboses in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Interventions designed to enhance fibrinolysis might prove to be useful adjuncts in the treatment of coagulopathy in a subset of COVID-19 patients.",

        "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is associated with hypercoagulability that may cause thromobembolic complications. We describe our recent studies investigating the mechanisms of hypercoagulability in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation during the COVID-19 crisis in New York City in spring 2020. Using rotational thombelastometry we found that almost all patients with severe COVID-19 had signs of hypercoagulability compared with non-COVID-19 controls. Specifically, the maximal clot firmness in the fibrin-based extrinsically activated test was almost twice the upper limit of normal in COVID patients, indicating a fibrin-mediated cause for hypercoagulability. To better understand the mechanism of this hypercoagulability we measured the components of the fibrinolytic pathways. Fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, but not plasminogen levels were elevated in patients with severe COVID-19. Our studies indicate that hypercoagulability in COVID-19 may be because of decreased fibrinolysis resulting from inhibition of plasmin through high levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Clinicians creating treatment protocols for anticoagulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients should consider these potential mechanisms of hypercoaguability.",

Intracellular expression of SARS-CoV-2 E protein increases intra-Golgi pH.

        "Title": "Alcohol reduces the activity of somatostatin interneurons in the mouse prefrontal cortex: A neural basis for its disinhibitory effect?",
        "Abstract": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in executive (\"top-down\") control of behavior and its function is especially susceptible to the effects of alcohol, leading to behavioral disinhibition that is associated with alterations in decision making, response inhibition, social anxiety and working memory. The circuitry of the PFC involves a complex interplay between pyramidal neurons (PNs) and several subclasses of inhibitory interneurons (INs), including somatostatin (SST)-expressing INs. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we showed that alcohol dose-dependently altered network activity in layers 2/3 of the prelimbic subregion of the mouse PFC. Low doses of alcohol (1\u00a0g/kg, intraperitoneal, i.p.) caused moderate activation of SST INs and weak inhibition of PNs. At moderate to high doses, alcohol (2-3\u00a0g/kg) strongly inhibited the activity of SST INs in vivo, and this effect may result in disinhibition, as the activity of a subpopulation of PNs was simultaneously enhanced. In contrast, recordings in brain slices using ex vivo electrophysiology revealed no direct effect of alcohol on the excitability of either SST INs or PNs over a range of concentrations (20 and 50\u00a0mM) consistent with the blood alcohol levels reached in the in vivo experiments. This dose-dependent effect of alcohol on SST INs in vivo may reveal a neural basis for the disinhibitory effect of alcohol in the PFC mediated by other neurons within or external to the PFC circuitry.",

        "Abstract": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) integrates inputs from multiple subcortical regions including the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) and the ventral hippocampus (vHPC). How the mPFC differentially processes these inputs is not known. One possibility is that these two inputs target discreet populations of mPFC cells. Alternatively, individual prefrontal cells could receive convergent inputs but distinguish between both inputs based on synaptic differences, such as communication frequency. To address this, we utilized a dual wavelength optogenetic approach to stimulate MD and vHPC inputs onto single, genetically defined mPFC neuronal subtypes. Specifically, we compared the convergence and synaptic dynamics of both inputs onto mPFC pyramidal cells, and parvalbumin (PV)- and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons. We found that all individual pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of the mPFC receive convergent input from both MD and vHPC. In contrast, PV neurons receive input biased from the MD, while VIP cells receive input biased from the vHPC. Independent of the target, MD inputs transferred information more reliably at higher frequencies (20\u00a0Hz) than vHPC inputs. Thus, MD and vHPC projections converge functionally onto mPFC pyramidal cells, but both inputs are distinguished by frequency-dependent synaptic dynamics and preferential engagement of discreet interneuron populations.",

        "Abstract": "Periodic episodes of excessive alcohol consumption (\"binge drinking\") occur frequently among adolescents, and early binge drinking is associated with an increased risk of alcohol use disorders later in life. The PFC undergoes significant development during adolescence and hence may be especially susceptible to the effects of binge drinking. In humans and in animal models, adolescent alcohol exposure is known to alter PFC neuronal activity and produce deficits in PFC-dependent behaviors, such as decision making, response inhibition, and working memory. Using a voluntary intermittent access to alcohol (IA EtOH) procedure in male mice, we demonstrate that binge-level alcohol consumption during adolescence leads to altered drinking patterns and working memory deficits in young adulthood, two outcomes that suggest medial PFC dysfunction. We recorded from pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the prelimbic subregion of the medial PFC in slices obtained from mice that had IA EtOH and found that they display altered excitability, including a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and reductions in the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I",

        "Abstract": "Neuronal inhibition can occur via synaptic mechanisms or through tonic activation of extrasynaptic receptors. In spinal cord, glycine mediates synaptic inhibition through the activation of heteromeric glycine receptors (GlyRs) composed primarily of \u03b11 and \u03b2 subunits. Inhibitory GlyRs are also found throughout the brain, where GlyR \u03b12 and \u03b13 subunit expression exceeds that of \u03b11, particularly in forebrain structures, and coassembly of these \u03b1 subunits with the \u03b2 subunit appears to occur to a lesser extent than in spinal cord. Here, we analyzed GlyR currents in several regions of the adolescent mouse forebrain (striatum, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis). Our results show ubiquitous expression of GlyRs that mediate large-amplitude currents in response to exogenously applied glycine in these forebrain structures. Additionally, tonic inward currents were also detected, but only in the striatum, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex (PFC). These tonic currents were sensitive to both strychnine and picrotoxin, indicating that they are mediated by extrasynaptic homomeric GlyRs.

        "Abstract": "Alcohol has many effects on brain function and hence on human behavior, ranging from anxiolytic and mild disinhibitory effects, sedation and motor incoordination, amnesia, emesis, hypnosis and eventually unconsciousness. In recent years a variety of studies have shown that acute and chronic exposure to alcohol can modulate ion channels that regulate excitability. Modulation of intrinsic excitability provides another way in which alcohol can influence neuronal network activity, in addition to its actions on synaptic inputs. In this review, we review \"low dose\" effects [between 2 and 20\u00a0mM EtOH], and \"medium dose\"; effects [between 20 and 50\u00a0mM], by considering in turn each of the many networks and brain regions affected by alcohol, and thereby attempt to integrate in\u00a0vitro physiological studies in specific brain regions (e.g. amygdala, ventral tegmental area, prefrontal cortex, thalamus, cerebellum etc.) within the context of alcohol's behavioral actions in\u00a0vivo (e.g. anxiolysis, euphoria, sedation, motor incoordination).

        "Abstract": "Enhanced dopamine (DA) neurotransmission from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the ventral striatum is thought to drive drug self-administration and mediate positive reinforcement. We examined neuronal firing rates in slices of mouse midbrain following adolescent binge-like alcohol drinking and find that prior alcohol experience greatly enhanced the sensitivity to excitation by ethanol itself (10-50\u00a0mM) in a subset of ventral midbrain DA neurons located in the medial VTA. This enhanced response after drinking was not associated with alterations of firing rate or other measures of intrinsic excitability. In addition, the phenomenon appears to be specific to adolescent drinking, as mice that established a drinking preference only after the onset of adulthood showed no change in alcohol sensitivity. Here we demonstrate not only that drinking during adolescence induces enhanced alcohol sensitivity, but also that this DA neuronal response occurs over a range of alcohol concentrations associated with social drinking in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Alcohol abuse and dependence are a serious public health problem. A large number of alcohol-regulated genes, (ARGs) are known to be influenced by alcohol use and withdrawal (AW), and recent evidence suggests that neuroadaptation to alcohol may be due in part to epigenetic changes in the expression of ARGs. Gabra4, which encodes the \u03b14 subunit of GABAA receptors (GABAARs), is one of a number of ARGs that show remarkable plasticity in response to alcohol, being rapidly upregulated by acute alcohol exposure. This study addressed the effects of AW on changes in the expression of Gabra4 and related genes that encode other subunits of GABAARs, and the potential regulation of Gabra4 by microRNAs.",

They are the primary targets for benzodiazepines, which are widely used to treat neurological disorders including anxiety, epilepsy and insomnia. The mechanism by which benzodiazepines enhance GABAA receptor activity has been extensively studied, but there is little mechanistic information on how non-benzodiazepine drugs that bind to the same site exert their effects. Eszopiclone and zolpidem are two non-benzodiazepine drugs for which no mechanism of action has yet been proposed, despite their clinical importance as sleeping aids. Here we investigate how both drugs enhance the activity of \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 GABAA receptors.",

        "Abstract": "Brain imaging studies performed in humans have associated low striatal dopamine release and D2R binding with alcohol dependence. Conversely, high striatal D2R binding has been observed in unaffected members of alcoholic families suggesting that high D2R function may protect against alcohol dependence. A possible protective role of increased D2R levels in the striatum is further supported by preclinical studies in non-human primates and rodents. Here, we determined whether there is a causal relationship between D2R levels and alcohol intake. To this end, we upregulated D2R expression levels in the nucleus accumbens of the adult mouse, but selectively restricted the upregulation to the indirect striatal output pathway, which endogenously expresses D2Rs. After overexpression was established, mice were tested in two models of free-choice alcohol drinking: the continuous and intermittent access two-bottle choice models. As anticipated, we found that D2R upregulation leads to hyperactivity in the open field. Contrary to our expectation, D2R upregulation did not reduce alcohol intake during continuous or intermittent access or when alcohol drinking was tested in the context of aversive outcomes. These data argue against a protective role of accumbal indirect pathway D2Rs in alcohol consumption but emphasize their importance in promoting locomotor activity.",

        "Title": "Strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors on pyramidal neurons in layers II/III of the mouse prefrontal cortex are tonically activated.",
        "Abstract": "Processing of signals within the cerebral cortex requires integration of synaptic inputs and a coordination between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. In addition to the classic form of synaptic inhibition, another important mechanism that can regulate neuronal excitability is tonic inhibition via sustained activation of receptors by ambient levels of inhibitory neurotransmitter, usually GABA. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this occurs in layer II/III pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the prelimbic region of the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We found that these neurons respond to exogenous GABA and to the \u03b14\u03b4-containing GABAA receptor (GABA(A)R)-selective agonist gaboxadol, consistent with the presence of extrasynaptic GABA(A)R populations. Spontaneous and miniature synaptic currents were blocked by the GABA(A)R antagonist gabazine and had fast decay kinetics, consistent with typical synaptic GABA(A)Rs. Very few layer II/III neurons showed a baseline current shift in response to gabazine, but almost all showed a current shift (15-25 pA) in response to picrotoxin. In addition to being a noncompetitive antagonist at GABA(A)Rs, picrotoxin also blocks homomeric glycine receptors (GlyRs). Application of the GlyR antagonist strychnine caused a modest but consistent shift (\u223c15 pA) in membrane current, without affecting spontaneous synaptic events, consistent with the tonic activation of GlyRs. Further investigation showed that these neurons respond in a concentration-dependent manner to glycine and taurine. Inhibition of glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) with sarcosine resulted in an inward current and an increase of the strychnine-sensitive current. Our data demonstrate the existence of functional GlyRs in layer II/III of the mPFC and a role for these receptors in tonic inhibition that can have an important influence on mPFC excitability and signal processing.",

        "Title": "HSF1 transcriptional activity mediates alcohol induction of Vamp2 expression and GABA release.",
        "Abstract": "Many central synapses are highly sensitive to alcohol, and it is now accepted that short-term alterations in synaptic function may lead to longer-term changes in circuit function. The regulation of postsynaptic receptors by alcohol has been well studied, but the mechanisms underlying the effects of alcohol on the presynaptic terminal are relatively unexplored. To identify a pathway by which alcohol regulates neurotransmitter release, we recently investigated the mechanism by which ethanol induces Vamp2, but not Vamp1, in mouse primary cortical cultures. These two genes encode isoforms of synaptobrevin, a vesicular soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein required for synaptic vesicle fusion. We found that alcohol activates the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) to induce Vamp2 expression, while Vamp1 mRNA levels remain unaffected. As the Vamp2 gene encodes a SNARE protein, we then investigated whether ethanol exposure and HSF1 transcriptional activity alter neurotransmitter release using electrophysiology. We found that alcohol increased the frequency of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated miniature IPSCs via HSF1, but had no effect on mEPSCs. Overall, these data indicate that alcohol induces HSF1 transcriptional activity to trigger a specific coordinated adaptation in GABAergic presynaptic terminals. This mechanism could explain some of the changes in synaptic function that occur soon after alcohol exposure, and may underlie some of the more enduring effects of chronic alcohol intake on local circuit function.",

        "Abstract": "Astrocytes are critical for maintaining homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS), and also participate in the genomic response of the brain to drugs of abuse, including alcohol. In this study, we investigated ethanol regulation of gene expression in astrocytes. A microarray screen revealed that a brief exposure of cortical astrocytes to ethanol increased the expression of a large number of genes. Among the alcohol-responsive genes (ARGs) are glial-specific immune response genes, as well as genes involved in the regulation of transcription, cell proliferation, and differentiation, and genes of the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. Genes involved in metabolism were also upregulated by alcohol exposure, including genes associated with oxidoreductase activity, insulin-like growth factor signaling, acetyl-CoA, and lipid metabolism. Previous microarray studies performed on ethanol-treated hepatocyte cultures and mouse liver tissue revealed the induction of almost identical classes of genes to those identified in our microarray experiments, suggesting that alcohol induces similar signaling mechanisms in the brain and liver. We found that acute ethanol exposure activated heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) in astrocytes, as demonstrated by the translocation of this transcription factor to the nucleus and the induction of a family of known HSF1-dependent genes, the heat shock proteins (Hsps). Transfection of a constitutively transcriptionally active Hsf1 construct into astrocytes induced many of the ARGs identified in our microarray study supporting the hypothesis that HSF1 transcriptional activity, as part of the heat shock cascade, may mediate the ethanol induction of these genes. These data indicate that acute ethanol exposure alters gene expression in astrocytes, in part via the activation of HSF1 and the heat shock cascade.",

        "Abstract": "Structural plasticity in the adult brain is essential for adaptive behaviors and is thought to contribute to a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Medium spiny neurons of the striatum show a high degree of structural plasticity that is modulated by dopamine through unknown signaling mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of dopamine D2 receptors in medium spiny neurons increases their membrane excitability and decreases the complexity and length of their dendritic arbors. These changes can be reversed in the adult animal after restoring D2 receptors to wild-type levels, demonstrating a remarkable degree of structural plasticity in the adult striatum. Increased excitability and decreased dendritic arborization are associated with downregulation of inward rectifier potassium channels (Kir2.1/2.3). Downregulation of Kir2 function is critical for the neurophysiological and morphological changes in vivo because virally mediated expression of a dominant-negative Kir2 channel is sufficient to recapitulate the changes in D2 transgenic mice. These findings may have important implications for the understanding of basal ganglia disorders, and more specifically schizophrenia, in which excessive activation of striatal D2 receptors has long been hypothesized to be of pathophysiologic significance.",

        "Title": "The activation mechanism of alpha1beta2gamma2S and alpha3beta3gamma2S GABAA receptors.",
        "Abstract": "The alpha1beta2gamma2 and alpha3beta3gamma2 are two isoforms of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor that are widely distributed in the brain. Both are found at synapses, for example in the thalamus, where they mediate distinctly different inhibitory postsynaptic current profiles, particularly with respect to decay time. The two isoforms were expressed in HEK293 cells, and single-channel activity was recorded from outside-out patches. The kinetic characteristics of both isoforms were investigated by analyzing single-channel currents over a wide range of GABA concentrations. Alpha1beta2gamma2 channels exhibited briefer active periods than alpha3beta3gamma2 channels over the entire range of agonist concentrations and had lower intraburst open probabilities at subsaturating concentrations. Activation mechanisms were constructed by fitting postulated schemes to data recorded at saturating and subsaturating GABA concentrations simultaneously. Reaction mechanisms were ranked according to log-likelihood values and how accurately they simulated ensemble currents. The highest ranked mechanism for both channels consisted of two sequential binding steps, followed by three conducting and three nonconducting configurations. The equilibrium dissociation constant for GABA at alpha3beta3gamma2 channels was approximately 2.6 microM compared with approximately 19 microM for alpha1beta2gamma2 channels, suggesting that GABA binds to the alpha3beta3gamma2 channels with higher affinity. A notable feature of the mechanism was that two consecutive doubly liganded shut states preceded all three open configurations. The lifetime of the third shut state was briefer for the alpha3beta3gamma2 channels. The longer active periods, higher affinity, and preference for conducting states are consistent with the slower decay of inhibitory currents at synapses that contain alpha3beta3gamma2 channels. The reaction mechanism we describe here may also be appropriate for the analysis of other types of GABAA receptors and provides a framework for rational investigation of the kinetic effects of a variety of therapeutic agents that activate or modulate GABAA receptors and hence influence synaptic and extrasynaptic inhibition in the central nervous system.",

Recently, a novel form of GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition, termed \"tonic\" inhibition, has been described. Whereas synaptic GABA(A) receptors underlie classical \"phasic\" GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition (inhibitory postsynaptic currents), tonic GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition results from the activation of extrasynaptic receptors by low concentrations of ambient GABA. Extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors are composed of receptor subunits that convey biophysical properties ideally suited to the generation of persistent inhibition and are pharmacologically and functionally distinct from their synaptic counterparts. This mini-symposium review highlights ongoing work examining the properties of recombinant and native extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors and their preferential targeting by endogenous and clinically relevant agents. In addition, it emphasizes the important role of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors in GABAergic inhibition throughout the CNS and identifies them as a major player in both physiological and pathophysiological processes.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years there has been an explosion of interest in how genes regulate alcohol drinking and contribute to alcoholism. This work has been stimulated by the completion of the human and mouse genome projects and the resulting availability of gene microarrays. Most of this work has been performed in drinking animals, and has utilized the extensive genetic variation among different mouse strains. At the same time, a much smaller amount of effort has gone into the in vitro study of the mechanisms underlying the regulation of individual genes by alcohol. These studies at the cellular and sub-cellular level are beginning to reveal the ways in which alcohol can interact with the transcriptional, translational and post-translational events inside the cell. Detailed studies of the promoter regions within several individual alcohol-responsive genes (ARGs) have been performed and this work has uncovered intricate signaling pathways that may be generalized to larger groups of ARGs. In the last few years several distinct ARGs have been identified from 35,000 mouse genes, by both the \"top-down\" approach (ex vivo gene arrays) and the \"bottom-up\" methods (in vitro promoter analysis). These divergent methodologies have converged on a surprisingly small number of genes encoding ion channels, receptors, transcription factors and proteins involved in synaptic function and remodeling. In this review we will describe some of the most interesting cellular and microarray work in the field, and will outline specific examples of genes for which the mechanisms of regulation by alcohol are now somewhat understood.",

        "Title": "The modulation of synaptic GABA(A) receptors in the thalamus by eszopiclone and zolpidem.",
        "Abstract": "Eszopiclone (Lunesta; Sepracor, Marlborough, MA) and zolpidem [N,N,6-trimethyl-2-(4-methylphenyl)-imidazo(1,2-a)pyridine-3-acetamide] are among the most commonly prescribed hypnotics in use in the United States. The thalamus plays a pivotal role in sleep regulation and rhythmicity. Two distinct subtypes of synaptic GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)-Rs), alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) and alpha(3)beta(3)gamma(2), are expressed in thalamocortical relay neurons and in interneurons of the RTN (reticular thalamic nucleus), respectively. Thalamocortical neurons also express extrasynaptic GABA(A)-Rs composed of alpha(4)beta(2)delta subunits. In this study, we compared the effects of eszopiclone and zolpidem on miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), spontaneous IPSCs, and tonic inhibition in the mouse thalamus. Eszopiclone (0.1-1 microM) slowed the decay phase of IPSCs recorded from RTN neurons, whereas zolpidem was less effective and increased the decay time constant only at > or = 0.3 microM. IPSCs of RTN neurons were more sensitive to eszopiclone than zolpidem at all concentrations tested. On the other hand, IPSCs of relay neurons in the ventrobasal nucleus (VB) were more sensitive to zolpidem than eszopiclone. Zolpidem (0.1-1 microM) prolonged the decay of IPSCs from VB neurons, whereas eszopiclone increased the decay time constant only at > or = 0.3 microM. Neither of these two hypnotics affected tonic inhibition in relay neurons. Our results demonstrate that eszopiclone has greater efficacy at synaptic GABA(A)-Rs of RTN neurons than in relay neurons, whereas zolpidem exerts bigger effects on relay neurons than RTN neurons. This distinct pattern of activity on thalamic neurons may contribute to some of the observed differences in the clinical effects of these two hypnotics.",

Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of tolerance and physical dependence (withdrawal) may provide insight into alcohol addiction. While the exact molecular mechanisms of ethanol action are unclear, gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) have been extensively implicated in ethanol action. The alpha1 GABA(A)-R subunit is associated with tolerance and physical dependence, but its exact role remains unknown. In this report, we tested the hypothesis that alpha1-GABA(A)-Rs mediate in part these effects of ethanol.",

        "Title": "Isoflurane modulates excitability in the mouse thalamus via GABA-dependent and GABA-independent mechanisms.",
        "Abstract": "GABAergic neurons in the reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN) synapse onto thalamocortical neurons in the ventrobasal (VB) thalamus, and this reticulo-thalamocortical pathway is considered an anatomic target for general anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. A mutant mouse was engineered to harbor two amino acid substitutions (S270H, L277A) in the GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)-R) alpha1 subunit; this mutation abolished sensitivity to the volatile anesthetic isoflurane in recombinant GABA(A)-Rs, and reduced in vivo sensitivity to isoflurane in the loss-of-righting-reflex assay. We examined the effects of the double mutation on GABA(A)-R-mediated synaptic currents and isoflurane sensitivity by recording from thalamic neurons in brain slices. The double mutation accelerated the decay, and decreased the (1/2) width of, evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) in VB neurons and attenuated isoflurane-induced prolongation of the eIPSC. The hypnotic zolpidem, a selective modulator of GABA(A)-Rs containing the alpha1 subunit, prolonged eIPSC duration regardless of genotype, indicating that mutant mice incorporate alpha1 subunit-containing GABA(A)-Rs into synapses. In RTN neurons, which lack the alpha1 subunit, eIPSC duration was longer than in VB, regardless of genotype. Isoflurane reduced the efficacy of GABAergic transmission from RTN to VB, independent of genotype, suggesting a presynaptic action in RTN neurons. Consistent with this observation, isoflurane inhibited both tonic action potential and rebound burst firing in the presence of GABA(A)-R blockade. The suppressed excitability in RTN neurons is likely mediated by isoflurane-enhanced Ba(2+)-sensitive, but 4-aminopyridine-insenstive, potassium conductances. We conclude that isoflurane enhances inhibition of thalamic neurons in VB via GABA(A)-R-dependent, but in RTN via GABA(A)-R-independent, mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Drinking alcohol is associated with the disturbance of normal sleep rhythms, and insomnia is a major factor in alcoholic relapse. The thalamus is a brain structure that plays a pivotal role in sleep regulation and rhythmicity. A number of studies have implicated GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) in the anxiolytic, amnestic, sedative, and anesthetic effects of ethanol. In the present study, we examined the effects of ethanol on both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A)-Rs of relay neurons in the thalamus. We found that ethanol (> or =50 mM) elicits a sustained current in thalamocortical relay neurons from the mouse ventrobasal thalamus, and this current is associated with a decrease in neuronal excitability and firing rate in response to depolarization. The steady current induced by ethanol was totally abolished by gabazine and was absent in relay neurons from GABA(A)-R alpha(4) subunit knockout mice, indicating that the effect of ethanol is to enhance tonic GABA-mediated inhibition. Ethanol (50 mM) enhanced the amplitude of tonic inhibition by nearly 50%. On the other hand, ethanol had no effect on spontaneous or evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) at 50 mM but did prolong IPSCs at 100 mM. Ethanol had no effect on the paired-pulse depression ratio, suggesting that the release of GABA from presynaptic terminals is insensitive to ethanol. We conclude that ethanol, at moderate (50 mM) but not low (10 mM) concentrations, can inhibit thalamocortical relay neurons and that this occurs mainly via the actions of ethanol at extrasynaptic GABA(A)-Rs containing GABA(A)-R alpha(4) subunits.",

        "Abstract": "The family of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs) mediates two types of inhibition in the mammalian brain. Phasic inhibition is mediated by synaptic GABA(A)Rs that are mainly comprised of alpha(1), beta(2), and gamma(2) subunits, whereas tonic inhibition is mediated by extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs comprised of alpha(4/6), beta(2), and delta subunits. We investigated the activation properties of recombinant alpha(4)beta(2)delta and alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A)Rs in response to GABA and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3(2H)-one (THIP) using electrophysiological recordings from outside-out membrane patches. Rapid agonist application experiments indicated that THIP produced faster opening rates at alpha(4)beta(2)delta GABA(A)Rs (beta approximately 1600 s(-1)) than at alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A)Rs (beta approximately 460 s(-1)), whereas GABA activated alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A)Rs more rapidly (beta approximately 1800 s(-1)) than alpha(4)beta(2)delta GABA(A)Rs (beta < 440 s(-1)). Single channel recordings of alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) and alpha(4)beta(2)delta GABA(A)Rs showed that both channels open to a main conductance state of approximately 25 pS at -70 mV when activated by GABA and low concentrations of THIP, whereas saturating concentrations of THIP elicited approximately 36 pS openings at both channels. Saturating concentrations of GABA elicited brief (<10 ms) openings with low intraburst open probability (P(O) approximately 0.3) at alpha(4)beta(2)delta GABA(A)Rs and at least two \"modes\" of single channel bursting activity, lasting approximately 100 ms at alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A)Rs. The most prevalent bursting mode had a P(O) of approximately 0.7 and was described by a reaction scheme with three open and three shut states, whereas the \"high\" P(O) mode ( approximately 0.9) was characterized by two shut and three open states. Single channel activity elicited by THIP in alpha(4)beta(2)delta and alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A)Rs occurred as a single population of bursts (P(O) approximately 0.4-0.5) of moderate duration (approximately 33 ms) that could be described by schemes containing two shut and two open states for both GABA(A)Rs. Our data identify kinetic properties that are receptor-subtype specific and others that are agonist specific, including unitary conductance.",

        "Title": "Molecular modeling and mutagenesis reveals a tetradentate binding site for Zn2+ in GABA(A) alphabeta receptors and provides a structural basis for the modulating effect of the gamma subunit.",
        "Abstract": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)-R) containing alpha1beta2gamma2 subunits are weakly inhibited by Zn2+, whereas receptors containing only the alpha1beta2 subunits are strongly inhibited. We built homology models of the ion pores of alpha1beta2 and alpha1beta2gamma2 GABA(A)-R using coordinates of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor as a template. Threading the GABA(A)-R beta2 sequence onto this template placed the 17' histidine and the 20' glutamate residues at adjacent locations in the mouth of the pore, such that a nearly ideal tetradentate site for Zn2+ was formed from two histidine and two glutamate residues between adjacent beta subunits in the alpha1beta2 GABA(A)-R. Following optimization with CHARMM, the distance between the alpha-carbons of the adjacent histidine residues was approximately 9.2 A, close to the ideal distance for a Zn2+ binding site. Loss of inhibition by Zn2+ in alpha1beta2gamma2 GABA(A)-R can be explained by the geometry of these residues in the arrangement alpha1beta2gamma2alpha1beta2, in which the nearest C-alpha-C-alpha distance between the histidine residues is 15.5 A, too far apart for an energetically optimal Zn2+ binding site. We then mutated the gamma subunit at the 17' and/or 20' positions. Zn2+ inhibition was not restored in alpha1beta2gamma2 (I282H) receptors. A novel finding is that the modeling shows the native 20' lysine in gamma2 can compete with Zn2+ for binding to the inserted 17' histidine. Sensitivity to Zn2+ was restored in the double mutant receptor, alpha1beta2gamma2 (I282H; K285E), in which the competition with lysine was removed and a more favorable Zn2+ binding site was formed.",

        "Title": "Taurine is a potent activator of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors in the thalamus.",
        "Abstract": "Taurine is one of the most abundant free amino acids in the brain. In a number of studies, taurine has been reported to activate glycine receptors (Gly-Rs) at moderate concentrations (> or = 100 microM), and to be a weak agonist at GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)-Rs), which are usually activated at high concentrations (> or = 1 mM). In this study, we show that taurine reduced the excitability of thalamocortical relay neurons and activated both extrasynaptic GABA(A)-Rs and Gly-Rs in neurons in the mouse ventrobasal (VB) thalamus. Low concentrations of taurine (10-100 microM) decreased neuronal input resistance and firing frequency, and elicited a steady outward current under voltage clamp, but had no effects on fast inhibitory synaptic currents. Currents elicited by 50 microM taurine were abolished by gabazine, insensitive to midazolam, and partially blocked by 20 microM Zn2+, consistent with the pharmacological properties of extrasynaptic GABA(A)-Rs (alpha4beta2delta subtype) involved in tonic inhibition in the thalamus. Tonic inhibition was enhanced by an inhibitor of taurine transport, suggesting that taurine can act as an endogenous activator of these receptors. Taurine-evoked currents were absent in relay neurons from GABA(A)-R alpha4 subunit knock-out mice. The amplitude of the taurine current was larger in neurons from adult mice than juvenile mice. Taurine was a more potent agonist at recombinant alpha4beta2delta GABA(A)-Rs than at alpha1beta2gamma2 GABA(A)-Rs. We conclude that physiological concentrations of taurine can inhibit VB neurons via activation of extrasynaptic GABA(A)-Rs and that taurine may function as an endogenous regulator of excitability and network activity in the thalamus.",

        "Title": "Isoflurane is a potent modulator of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors in the thalamus.",
        "Abstract": "Volatile anesthetics are used clinically to produce analgesia, amnesia, unconsciousness, blunted autonomic responsiveness, and immobility. Previous work has shown that the volatile anesthetic isoflurane, at concentrations that produce unconsciousness (250-500 microM), enhances fast synaptic inhibition in the brain mediated by GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)-Rs). In addition, isoflurane causes sedation at concentrations lower than those required to produce unconsciousness or analgesia. In this study, we found that isoflurane, at low concentrations (25-85 microM) associated with its sedative actions, elicits a sustained current associated with a conductance increase in thalamocortical neurons in the mouse ventrobasal (VB) nucleus. These isoflurane-evoked currents reversed polarity close to the Cl(-) equilibrium potential and were totally blocked by the GABA(A)-R antagonist gabazine. Isoflurane (25-250 microM) produced no sustained current in VB neurons from GABA(A)-R alpha(4)-subunit knockout (Gabra4(-/-)) mice, although 250 microM isoflurane enhanced synaptic inhibition in VB neurons from both wild-type and Gabra4(-/-) mice. These data indicate an obligatory requirement for alpha(4)-subunit expression in the generation of the isoflurane-activated current. In addition, isoflurane directly activated alpha(4)beta(2)delta GABA(A)-Rs expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and it was more potent at alpha(4)beta(2)delta than at alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) receptors (the presumptive extrasynaptic and synaptic GABA(A)-R subtypes in VB neurons). We conclude that the extrasynaptic GABA(A)-Rs of thalamocortical neurons are sensitive to low concentrations of isoflurane. In view of the crucial role of the thalamus in sensory processing, sleep, and cognition, the modulation of these extrasynaptic GABA(A)-Rs by isoflurane may contribute to the sedation and hypnosis associated with low doses of this anesthetic agent.",

        "Abstract": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) have been implicated in mediating some of the behavioral effects of ethanol (EtOH), but the contribution of specific GABA(A)-R subunits is not yet fully understood. The GABA(A)-R alpha 4 subunit often partners with beta2/3 and delta subunits to form extrasynaptic GABA(A)-Rs that mediate tonic inhibition. Several in vitro studies have suggested that these extrasynaptic GABA(A)-Rs may be particularly relevant to the intoxicating effects of low doses of EtOH. In alpha 4 subunit knockout mice, tonic inhibition was greatly reduced, as were the potentiating effects of EtOH. We therefore hypothesized that those behavioral responses to EtOH that are mediated by alpha 4-containing GABA(A)-Rs would be diminished in alpha 4 knockout mice.",

        "Title": "Alcohol regulates gene expression in neurons via activation of heat shock factor 1.",
        "Abstract": "Drinking alcohol causes widespread alterations in gene expression that can result in long-term physiological changes. Although many alcohol-responsive genes (ARGs) have been identified, the mechanisms by which alcohol alters transcription are not well understood. To elucidate these mechanisms, we investigated Gabra4, a neuron-specific gene that is rapidly and robustly activated by alcohol (10-60 mM), both in vitro and in vivo. Here we show that alcohol can activate elements of the heat shock pathway in mouse cortical neurons to enhance the expression of Gabra4 and other ARGs. The activation of Gabra4 by alcohol or high temperature is dependent on the binding of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) to a short downstream DNA sequence, the alcohol response element (ARE). Alcohol and heat stimulate the translocation of HSF1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and the induction of HSF1-dependent genes, Hsp70 and Hsp90, in cultured neurons and in the mouse cerebral cortex in vivo. The reduction of HSF1 levels using small interfering RNA prevented the stimulation of Gabra4 and Hsp70 by alcohol and heat shock. Microarray analysis showed that many ARGs contain ARE-like sequences and that some of these genes are also activated by heat shock. We suggest that alcohol activates phylogenetically conserved pathways that involve intermediates in the heat shock cascade and that sequence elements similar to the ARE may mediate some of the changes in gene expression triggered by alcohol intake, which could be important in a variety of pathophysiological responses to alcohol.",

        "Title": "Mechanisms of sleep induction by GABA(A) receptor agonists.",
        "Abstract": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. GABA(A) receptors are pentameric complexes that function as ligand-gated chloride ion channels. Two types of inhibitory neurotransmission are mediated via GABA(A) receptors. Phasic inhibition results from the activation of receptors at the synapse by intermittent release of high concentrations of GABA from presynaptic terminals. Tonic inhibition, in contrast, is mediated by the continuous activation of receptors located outside the synaptic cleft by low concentrations of ambient GABA. These \"extrasynaptic\" receptors have a higher affinity for GABA and slower rates of desensitization and deactivation than do the classical \"synaptic\" receptors. A variety of subunit families make up GABA(A) receptors; a total of 19 distinct subunits have been cloned. This diversity in subunit composition results in substantial anatomical, functional, and pharmacologic heterogeneity. Receptors containing the alpha1, alpha2, or alpha3 subunits with gamma2 are usually found at synapses and are sensitive to benzodiazepines and zolpidem, whereas alpha4 and alpha6 subunits are often found with delta and play a role in extrasynaptic receptors (in thalamus and dentate), as does the alpha5 subunit (in CA1). The alpha4betadelta receptors are insensitive to benzodiazepines and zolpidem, but show high sensitivity to other sedative-hypnotic drugs, including ethanol and the novel hypnotic drug gaboxadol (THIP). This review will examine the role of heterogeneity of GABA(A) receptors, and recent research demonstrating subunit-dependent modulation of receptors by novel pharmacologic agents will be discussed.",

        "Title": "GABAA receptors in the thalamus: alpha4 subunit expression and alcohol sensitivity.",
        "Abstract": "The inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has long been implicated in the anxiolytic, amnesic, and sedative behavioral effects of alcohol. A large number of studies have investigated the interactions of alcohol with GABA receptors. Many investigators have reported effects of \"high concentrations\" (50-100 mM) of alcohol on GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition, but effects of the \"low concentrations\" (1-30 mM) of alcohol normally associated with mild intoxication have been elusive until recently. A novel form of \"tonic inhibition\" has been described in the central nervous system (CNS) that is generated by the persistent activation of extrasynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAA-Rs). These receptors are specific GABAA-R subtypes and distinct from the synaptic subtypes. Tonic inhibition regulates the excitability of individual neurons and the activity and rhythmicity of neural networks. Interestingly, several reports show that tonic inhibition is sensitive to low concentrations of alcohol. The thalamus is a structure that is critically important in the control of sleep and wakefulness. GABAergic inhibition in the thalamus plays a crucial role in the generation of sleep waves. Among the various GABAA-R subunits, the alpha1, alpha4, beta2, and delta subunits are heavily expressed in thalamic relay nuclei. Tonic inhibition has been demonstrated in thalamocortical relay neurons, where it is mediated by alpha4beta2delta GABAA-Rs. These extrasynaptic receptors are highly sensitive to gaboxadol, a novel hypnotic, but insensitive to benzodiazepines. Tonic inhibition is absent in thalamic relay neurons from alpha4 knockout mice, as are the sedative and analgesic effects of gaboxadol. The sedative effects of alcohol can promote sleep. However, alcohol also disrupts the normal sleep pattern and reduces sleep quality. As a result, sleep disturbance caused by alcohol can play a role in the progression of alcoholism. As an important regulator of sleep cycles, inhibition in the thalamus may therefore be involved in both the sedative effects of alcohol and the development of alcoholism. Investigating the effects of alcohol on both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA-Rs in the thalamus should help us to understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction between alcohol and sleep.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the pervasiveness of alcohol (ethanol) use, it is unclear how the multiple molecular targets for ethanol contribute to its many behavioral effects. The function of GABA type A receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) is altered by ethanol, but there are multiple subtypes of these receptors, and thus far, individual subunits have not been definitively linked with specific behavioral actions. The alpha1 subunit of the GABA(A)-R is the most abundant alpha subunit in the brain, and the goal of this study was to determine the role of receptors containing this subunit in alcohol action. We designed an alpha1 subunit with serine 270 to histidine and leucine 277 to alanine mutations that was insensitive to potentiation by ethanol yet retained normal GABA sensitivity and constructed knockin mice containing this mutant subunit. Hippocampal slice recordings from these mice indicated that the mutant receptors were less sensitive to ethanol's potentiating effects. Behaviorally, we observed that mutant mice recovered more quickly from the motor-impairing effects of ethanol and etomidate, but not pentobarbital, and showed increased anxiolytic effects of ethanol. No differences were observed in ethanol-induced hypnosis, locomotor stimulation, cognitive impairment, or in ethanol preference and consumption. Overall, these studies demonstrate that the postsynaptic effects of ethanol at GABAergic synapses containing the alpha1 subunit are important for specific ethanol-induced behavioral effects.",

        "Abstract": "The binding of the neurotransmitter GABA induces conformational changes in the GABAA receptor (GABAAR), leading to the opening of a gate that controls ion permeation through an integral transmembrane pore. A number of structural elements within each subunit, located near the membrane interface, are believed to undergo relative movements during this activation process. In this study, we explored the functional role of the beta-10 strand (pre-M1 segment), which connects the extracellular domain to the transmembrane domain. In alpha1beta2gamma2s GABAARs, analysis of the 12 residues of the beta-10 strand in the alpha1 subunit proximal to the first transmembrane domain identified two residues, alpha1V212 and alpha1K220, in which mutations produced rightward shifts in the GABA concentration-response relationship and also reduced the relative efficacy of the partial agonist, piperidine-4-sulphonic acid. Ultra-fast agonist techniques were applied to mutant alpha1(K220A)beta2gamma2s GABAARs and revealed that the macroscopic functional deficit in this mutant could be attributed to a slowing of the opening rate constant, from approximately 1500 s(-1) in wild-type (WT) channels to approximately 730 s(-1) in the mutant channels, and a reduction in the time spent in the active state for the mutant. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in agonist affinity, with half-maximal activation rates achieved at 0.77 mM GABA in WT and 1.4 mM GABA in the alpha1(K220A)beta2gamma2s channels. The beta-10 strand (pre-M1 segment) emerges, from this and other studies, as a key functional component in the activation of the GABAAR.",

        "Title": "GABA(A)-R alpha1 subunit knockin mutation leads to abnormal EEG and anesthetic-induced seizure-like activity in mice.",
        "Abstract": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid-type A receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) have been proposed as a target for many general anesthetics. We recently created knockin (KI) mice harboring a point mutation (serine 270 to histidine) in the GABA(A)-R alpha1 subunit. This mutation abolishes sensitivity of recombinant GABA(A)-Rs to isoflurane while maintaining normal sensitivity to halothane and increasing the potency of GABA. KI mice showed abnormalities in the EEG baseline, including occasional spike-wave activity and spindle-like bursts. When anesthetized with isoflurane, the KI mice but not the control mice revealed repetitive 4-5 Hz slow wave discharges in the cortical EEG. KI mice did not differ from controls in response to isoflurane or halothane in the standard tail clamp/withdrawal and loss of righting reflex assays. We recorded miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) from hippocampal interneurons and pyramidal cells in brain slices. mIPSCs in neurons from KI mice were of normal amplitude, but decayed more slowly than controls. Hippocampal mIPSCs in control mice were significantly prolonged by 0.4 and 0.9 MAC isoflurane, and by 0.5 MAC halothane. In KI mice, the effect of isoflurane on mIPSC decay was dramatically reduced, while halothane prolonged mIPSCs as for controls. We conclude that the kinetic and pharmacological properties of hippocampal GABA(A)-Rs in the KI mouse recapitulate many features of mutant alpha1beta2gamma2 GABA(A)-Rs observed in vitro. GABA(A)-Rs containing alpha1 subunits do not appear to contribute to the actions of isoflurane in the spinal cord, but both EEG and synaptic recordings provide evidence for effects of isoflurane on these GABA(A)-R isoforms in cortical structures.",

        "Abstract": "Although the depressant effects of the general anesthetic propofol on thalamocortical relay neurons clearly involve gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors, other mechanisms may be involved. The hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I(h)) regulates excitability and rhythmic firing in thalamocortical relay neurons in the ventrobasal (VB) complex of the thalamus. Here we investigated the effects of propofol on I(h)-related function in vitro and in vivo. In whole-cell current-clamp recordings from VB neurons in mouse (P23-35) brain slices, propofol markedly reduced the voltage sag and low-threshold rebound excitation that are characteristic of the activation of I(h). In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, propofol suppressed the I(h) conductance and slowed the kinetics of activation. The block of I(h) by propofol was associated with decreased regularity and frequency of delta-oscillations in VB neurons. The principal source of the I(h) current in these neurons is the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) type 2 channel. In human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells expressing recombinant mouse HCN2 channels, propofol decreased I(h) and slowed the rate of channel activation. We also investigated whether propofol might have persistent effects on thalamic excitability in the mouse. Three hours following an injection of propofol sufficient to produce loss-of-righting reflex in mice (P35), I(h) was decreased, and this was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in HCN2 and HCN4 immunoreactivity in thalamocortical neurons in vivo. These results suggest that suppression of I(h) may contribute to the inhibition of thalamocortical activity during propofol anesthesia. Longer-term effects represent a novel form of propofol-mediated regulation of I(h).",

        "Title": "An extrasynaptic GABAA receptor mediates tonic inhibition in thalamic VB neurons.",
        "Abstract": "Whole cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from thalamic ventrobasal (VB) and reticular (RTN) neurons in mouse brain slices. A bicuculline-sensitive tonic current was observed in VB, but not in RTN, neurons; this current was increased by the GABA(A) receptor agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisothiazolo-[5,4-c]pyridine-3-ol (THIP; 0.1 microM) and decreased by Zn(2+) (50 microM) but was unaffected by zolpidem (0.3 microM) or midazolam (0.2 microM). The pharmacological profile of the tonic current is consistent with its generation by activation of GABA(A) receptors that do not contain the alpha(1) or gamma(2) subunits. GABA(A) receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells that contained alpha(4)beta(2)delta subunits showed higher sensitivity to THIP (gaboxadol) and GABA than did receptors made up from alpha(1)beta(2)delta, alpha(4)beta(2)gamma(2s,) or alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2s) subunits. Western blot analysis revealed that there is little, if any, alpha(3) or alpha(5) subunit protein in VB. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that antibodies to the delta subunit could precipitate alpha(4), but not alpha(1) subunit protein. Confocal microscopy of thalamic neurons grown in culture confirmed that alpha(4) and delta subunits are extensively co-localized with one another and are found predominantly, but not exclusively, at extrasynaptic sites. We conclude that thalamic VB neurons express extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors that are highly sensitive to GABA and THIP and that these receptors are most likely made up of alpha(4)beta(2)delta subunits. In view of the critical role of thalamic neurons in the generation of oscillatory activity associated with sleep, these receptors may represent a principal site of action for the novel hypnotic agent gaboxadol.",

        "Abstract": "General anesthetics are essential to modern medicine, and yet a detailed understanding of their mechanisms of action is lacking. General anesthetics were once believed to be \"drugs without receptors\" but this view has been largely abandoned. During the past decade significant progress in our understanding of the mechanisms of general anesthetic action at the molecular, cellular and neural systems levels has been made. Different molecular targets in various regions of the nervous system are involved in the multiple components of anesthetic action, and these targets can vary between specific anesthetics. Neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, particularly receptors for GABA and glutamate, are modulated by most anesthetics, at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites, and additional ion channels and receptors are also being recognized as important targets for general anesthetics. In this article, these developments, which have important implications for the development of more-selective anesthetics, are reviewed in the context of recent advances in ion channel structure and function.",

        "Title": "Impairment of hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated channel function by the intravenous general anesthetic propofol.",
        "Abstract": "Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) is a widely used intravenous general anesthetic, which has been reported to produce bradycardia in patients at concentrations associated with profound sedation and loss of consciousness. Hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels conduct a monovalent cationic current I(h) (also known as I(q) or I(f)) that contributes to autorhythmicity in both the brain and heart. Here we studied the effects of propofol on recombinant HCN1, HCN2, and HCN4 channels and found that the drug inhibits and slows activation of all three channels at clinically relevant concentrations. In oocyte expression studies, HCN1 channel activation was most sensitive to slowing by propofol (EC(50) values of 5.6 +/- 1.0 microM for fast component and 31.5 +/- 7.5 microM for slow component). HCN1 channels also showed a marked propofol-induced hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation (EC(50) of 6.7 +/- 1.0 microM) and accelerated deactivation (EC(50) of 4.5 +/- 0.9 microM). Furthermore, propofol reduced heart rate in an isolated guinea pig heart preparation over the same range of concentrations. These data suggest that propofol modulation of HCN channel gating is an important molecular mechanism that can contribute to the depression of central nervous system function and also lead to bradyarrhythmias in patients receiving propofol during surgical anesthesia.",

        "Abstract": "The volatile anesthetic isoflurane both prolongs and reduces the amplitude of GABA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) recorded in neurons. To explore the latter effect, we investigated isoflurane-induced inhibition of steady-state desensitized GABA currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type alpha(1)beta(2), alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2s), mutant alpha(1)(S270H)beta(2) (serine to histidine at residue 270) or alpha(1)(S270H)beta(2)gamma(2s) receptors. The alpha(1) serine 270 site in TM2 (second transmembrane domain of the subunit) is postulated as a binding site for some volatile agents and is critical for positive modulation of sub-maximal GABA responses by isoflurane. For all receptor combinations, at < or =0.6 mM isoflurane (< or =2 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)) current inhibitions were not pronounced ( approximately 10%) with block reaching half-maximal levels at supraclinical concentrations ( approximately 2 mM isoflurane, 6 MAC). Comparisons with other GABA(A) receptor blockers indicated that isoflurane blocks in a similar manner to picrotoxin, possibly via the pore of the receptor. The extent of isoflurane-induced inhibition was significantly attenuated by inclusion of the gamma(2s)-subunit but was unaffected by introduction of the S270H mutation in the alpha(1)-subunit. In conclusion, isoflurane binds with low affinity and with subunit-specificity to an inhibitory site on the GABA(A) receptor that is distinct from the site that facilitates positive modulation at the extracellular end of the pore.",

        "Abstract": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor is the target of a structurally diverse group of sedative, hypnotic, and anesthetic drugs, including the volatile anesthetic isoflurane. Previous studies on the GABA(A) receptor have suggested the existence of a cavity located between transmembrane (TM) segments 2 and 3 in both alpha-1 and alpha-2 subunits, within which volatile anesthetics might bind. In this study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the involvement of homologous residues of the GABA(A) alpha-3 subunit in allosteric modulation by isoflurane. Mutation of serine residue 294 within the TM2 to histidine or tyrosine increased the potency of GABA and decreased positive modulation by isoflurane. Mutation of alanine residue 315 within the TM3 to tryptophan increased the potency of GABA and abolished isoflurane modulation. The activity of the intravenous anesthetic propofol was unaltered from wild-type at these mutant receptors. These findings are consistent with the action of isoflurane on a critical site within the transmembrane domains of the receptor and suggest a degree of functional homology between the GABA(A) alpha-1, -2, and -3 subunits.",

        "Title": "Evaluation of a proposed mechanism of ligand-gated ion channel activation in the GABAA and glycine receptors.",
        "Abstract": "Ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) mediate rapid chemical neurotransmission in the mammalian brain. This gene superfamily includes the nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR), GABA(A), 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3, and glycine receptors. Upon agonist binding these receptors undergo a rapid allosteric transition from the closed to open state. The molecular mechanism of coupling between agonist binding and channel gating remains poorly understood, in part due to the lack of a high-resolution structure of the entire receptor. Miyazawa, Fujiyoshi, and Unwin published a 4A resolution structure of the nAChR, and proposed that a single residue--valine 44 in Loop 2 of the extracellular domain--functions as a critical determinant of a \"pin-into-socket\" mechanism for receptor activation in nAChR. Here we examined whether this proposed \"pin-into-socket\" mechanism also contributes to channel activation in the GABA(A) and glycine receptors. We mutated residues corresponding to nAChR valine 44 in the GABA(A) (alpha(1) histidine 56 and beta(2) valine 53) and glycine (alpha(1) threonine 54) receptors. The results obtained in this study do not support a simple \"pin-into-socket\" mechanism of activation for the activation of GABA(A) and glycine receptors. This conclusion is consistent with other recent reports in which mutations of residues distributed throughout several loops of nAChR, GABA(A) and glycine receptors had large effects on gating behavior.",

        "Title": "Derivation of midbrain dopamine neurons from human embryonic stem cells.",
        "Abstract": "Human embryonic stem (hES) cells are defined by their extensive self-renewal capacity and their potential to differentiate into any cell type of the human body. The challenge in using hES cells for developmental biology and regenerative medicine has been to direct the wide differentiation potential toward the derivation of a specific cell fate. Within the nervous system, hES cells have been shown to differentiate in vitro into neural progenitor cells, neurons, and astrocytes. However, to our knowledge, the selective derivation of any given neuron subtype has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we describe conditions to direct hES cells into neurons of midbrain dopaminergic identity. Neuroectodermal differentiation was triggered on stromal feeder cells followed by regional specification by means of the sequential application of defined patterning molecules that direct in vivo midbrain development. Progression toward a midbrain dopamine (DA) neuron fate was monitored by the sequential expression of key transcription factors, including Pax2, Pax5, and engrailed-1 (En1), measurements of DA release, the presence of tetrodotoxin-sensitive action potentials, and the electron-microscopic visualization of tyrosinehydroxylase-positive synaptic terminals. High-yield DA neuron derivation was confirmed from three independent hES and two monkey embryonic stem cell lines. The availability of unlimited numbers of midbrain DA neurons is a first step toward exploring the potential of hES cells in preclinical models of Parkinson's disease. This experimental system also provides a powerful tool to probe the molecular mechanisms that control the development and function of human midbrain DA neurons.",

        "Title": "Alanine-scanning mutagenesis in the signature disulfide loop of the glycine receptor alpha 1 subunit: critical residues for activation and modulation.",
        "Abstract": "The glycine receptor enables the generation of inhibitory postsynaptic currents at synapses via neurotransmitter-dependent activation. These receptors belong to the ligand-gated ion channel gene superfamily, in which all members are comprised of five subunits, each of which possesses a signature 13-residue disulfide loop (Cys loop) in the extracellular domain. In this study, we used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the residues between C138 and C152 of the Cys loop of the glycine receptor alpha1 subunit to identify residues critical for receptor activation and allosteric modulation. Mutation of L142, F145, or P146 to alanine produced decreases in the potency, maximal amplitude, and Hill coefficient for currents elicited by glycine and impaired receptor activation by the agonist taurine. These residues, along with D148, are positionally conserved in the family of LGIC subunits. Mutation at several other positions had little or no effect. The inhaled anesthetics halothane and isoflurane potentiate submaximal agonist responses at wild-type receptors, via an allosteric site. The mutations L142A, F145A, P146A, and D148A abolished positive modulation by these anesthetics, in some cases revealing a small inhibitory effect. A molecular model of the glycine receptor alpha1 subunit suggests that the Cys loop is positioned in a region of the receptor at the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains and that the critical functional residues identified here lie along the face of a predominantly hydrophobic surface. The present data implicate the Cys loop as an important functional moiety in the process of glycine receptor activation and allosteric regulation by anesthetics.",

The alpha4 subunit of the GABAA-R confers distinct pharmacological properties on the receptor and its expression pattern exhibits plasticity in response to physiological and pharmacological stimuli, including withdrawal from progesterone and alcohol. We have analyzed the promoter region of the mouse GABRA4 gene that encodes the alpha4 subunit and found that the promoter has multiple transcriptional initiation sites and lacks a TATA box. The minimal promoter for GABRA4 spans the region between -444 to -19 bp relative to the coding ATG and shows high activity in cultured mouse cortical neurons. Both Sp3 and Sp4 transcription factors can interact with the two Sp1 binding sites within the minimal promoter and are critical for maximal activity of the promoter in neurons.",

        "Abstract": "gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)-R) mediate synaptic inhibition and meet many pharmacological criteria required of important general anesthetic targets. During synaptic transmission GABA release is sufficient to saturate, maximally activate, and transiently desensitize postsynaptic GABA(A)-Rs. The resulting inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) are prolonged by volatile anesthetics like isoflurane. We investigated the effects of isoflurane on maximally activated and desensitized GABA(A)-R currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Wild-type alpha(1)beta(2) and alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2s) receptors were exposed to 600 microM GABA until currents reached a steady-state desensitized level. At clinical concentrations (0.02-0.3 mM), isoflurane produced a dose-dependent enhancement of steady-state desensitized current in alpha(1)beta(2) receptors, an effect that was less apparent in receptors including a gamma(2s)-subunit. When serine at position 270 is mutated to histidine (alpha(1)(S270H)) in the second transmembrane segment of the alpha(1)-subunit, the currents evoked by sub-saturating concentrations of GABA became less sensitive to isoflurane enhancement. In addition, isoflurane enhancements of desensitized currents were greatly attenuated by this mutation and were undetectable in alpha(1)(S270H)beta(2)gamma(2s) receptors. In conclusion, isoflurane enhancement of GABA(A)-R currents evoked by saturating concentrations of agonist is subunit-dependent. The effects of isoflurane on desensitized receptors may be partly responsible for the prolongation of IPSCs during anesthesia.",

        "Title": "A novel hyperekplexia-causing mutation in the pre-transmembrane segment 1 of the human glycine receptor alpha1 subunit reduces membrane expression and impairs gating by agonists.",
        "Abstract": "In this study, we have compared the functional consequences of three mutations (R218Q, V260M, and Q266H) in the alpha(1) subunit of the glycine receptor (GlyRA1) causing hyperekplexia, an inherited neurological channelopathy. In HEK-293 cells, the agonist EC(50s) for glycine-activated Cl(-) currents were increased from 26 microm in wtGlyRA1, to 5747, 135, and 129 microm in R218Q, V260M, and Q266H GlyRA1 channels, respectively. Cl(-) currents elicited by beta-alanine and taurine, which behave as agonists at wtGlyRA1, were decreased in V260M and Q266H mutant receptors and virtually abolished in GlyRA1 R218Q receptors. Gly-gated Cl(-) currents were similarly antagonized by low concentrations of strychnine in both wild-type (wt) and R218Q GlyRA1 channels, suggesting that the Arg-218 residue plays a crucial role in GlyRA1 channel gating, with only minor effects on the agonist/antagonist binding site, a hypothesis supported by our molecular model of the GlyRA1 subunit. The R218Q mutation, but not the V260M or the Q266H mutation, caused a marked decrease of receptor subunit expression both in total cell lysates and in isolated plasma membrane proteins. This decreased expression does not seem to explain the reduced agonist sensitivity of GlyRA1 R218Q channels since no difference in the apparent sensitivity to glycine or taurine was observed when wtGlyRA1 receptors were expressed at levels comparable with those of R218Q mutant receptors. In conclusion, multiple mechanisms may explain the dramatic decrease in GlyR function caused by the R218Q mutation, possibly providing the molecular basis for its association with a more severe clinical phenotype.",

        "Abstract": "Fast synaptic inhibition in the mammalian central nervous system is mediated primarily via activation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAA-R). Upon agonist binding, the receptor undergoes a structural transition from the closed to the open state. This transition, known as gating, is thought to be associated with a sequence of conformational changes originating at the agonist-binding site, ultimately resulting in opening of the channel. Using site-directed mutagenesis and several different GABAA-R agonists, we identified a number of highly conserved charged residues in the GABAA-R beta2 subunit that appear to be involved in receptor activation. We then used charge reversal double mutants and disulfide trapping to investigate the interactions between these flexible loops within the beta2 subunit. The results suggest that interactions between an acidic residue in loop 7 (Asp146) and a basic residue in pre-transmembrane domain-1 (Lys215) are involved in coupling agonist binding to channel gating.",

Here we provide a set of coculture conditions that allows rapid and efficient derivation of most central nervous system phenotypes. The fate of both fertilization- and nuclear transfer-derived ES (ntES) cells was directed selectively into neural stem cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes or neurons. Specific differentiation into gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, serotonin or motor neurons was achieved by defining conditions to induce forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain and spinal cord identity. Neuronal function of ES cell-derived dopaminergic neurons was shown in vitro by electron microscopy, measurement of neurotransmitter release and intracellular recording. Furthermore, transplantation of ES and ntES cell-derived dopaminergic neurons corrected the phenotype of a mouse model of Parkinson disease, demonstrating an in vivo application of therapeutic cloning in neural disease.",

However, very little is known about the actions of sevoflurane and desflurane on recombinant GABAA receptors. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of sevoflurane and desflurane on potentiation of GABA-induced responses in the wild-type GABAA receptor and in receptors mutated in TM2 of the alpha1, alpha 2, or beta 2 subunits.",

        "Abstract": "Ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) mediate rapid chemical neurotransmission. This gene superfamily includes the nicotinic acetylcholine, GABAA/C, 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3, and glycine receptors. A signature disulfide loop (Cys loop) in the extracellular domain is a structural motif common to all LGIC member subunits. Here we report that a highly conserved aspartic acid residue within the Cys loop at position 148 (Asp-148) of the glycine receptor alpha1 subunit is critical in the process of receptor activation. Mutation of this acidic residue to the basic amino acid lysine produces a large decrease in the potency of glycine, produces a decrease in the Hill slope, and converts taurine from a full agonist to a partial agonist; these data are consistent with a molecular defect in the receptor gating mechanism. Additional mutation of Asp-148 shows that alterations in the EC50 for agonists are dependent upon the charge of the side chain at this position and not molecular volume, polarity, or hydropathy. This study implicates negative charge at position Asp-148 as a critical component of the process in which agonist binding is coupled to channel gating. This finding adds to an emerging body of evidence supporting the involvement of the Cys loop in the gating mechanism of the LGICs.",

        "Abstract": "Liver failure is often accompanied by cognitive impairment and coma, a syndrome known as hepatic encephalopathy (HE). The administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine (BZ) antagonist, is effective in reversing the symptoms of HE in many patients. These clinical observations gave rise to notions of an endogenous BZ-like mechanism in HE, but to date no viable candidate compounds have been characterized. We show here that the hemoglobin (Hb) metabolites hemin and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) interact with the BZ site on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor and enhance inhibitory synaptic transmission in a manner similar to diazepam and zolpidem. This finding suggests that hemin and PPIX are neuroactive porphyrins capable of acting as endogenous ligands for the central BZ site. The accumulation of these porphyrins under pathophysiologic conditions provides a potentially novel mechanism for the central manifestations of HE.",

        "Abstract": "Volatile anesthetics prolong inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in central neurons an allosteric action on the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor, an effect that may underlie the hypnotic actions of these agents. Inhaled anesthetics such as isoflurane act to enhance responses to submaximal concentrations of GABA, but it is not clear whether their effect is mediated by an increase in the binding of the agonist or by changes in receptor gating behavior. To address this question, the authors studied the effects of isoflurane on a mutant GABA(A) receptor with a gating defect that decreases receptor sensitivity by lowering agonist efficacy. They then compared the effects of clinically relevant concentrations of isoflurane on the actions of GABA and piperidine-4-sulfonic acid (P4S), a partial agonist at the GABA(A) receptor.",

        "Title": "Coupling of agonist binding to channel gating in the GABA(A) receptor.",
        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) mediate rapid synaptic transmission by activating receptors belonging to the gene superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs). These channels are pentameric proteins that function as signal transducers, converting chemical messages into electrical signals. Neurotransmitters activate LGICs by interacting with a ligand-binding site, triggering a conformational change in the protein that results in the opening of an ion channel. This process, which is known as 'gating', occurs rapidly and reversibly, but the molecular rearrangements involved are not well understood. Here we show that optimal gating in the GABA(A) receptor, a member of the LGIC superfamily, is dependent on electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged Asp 57 and Asp 149 residues in extracellular loops 2 and 7, and the positively charged Lys 279 residue in the transmembrane 2-3 linker region of the alpha1-subunit. During gating, Asp 149 and Lys 279 seem to move closer to one another, providing a potential mechanism for the coupling of ligand binding to opening of the ion channel.",

        "Title": "Molecular volume determines the activity of the halogenated alkane bromoform at wild-type and mutant GABA(A) receptors.",
        "Abstract": "The GABA(A) receptor is an important target for a variety of general anesthetics, including halogenated ethers such as isoflurane and halogenated ethers such as chloroform. Bromoform is a halogenated alkane that exhibits anesthetic properties and has been shown by X-ray crystallography to bind to model anesthetic targets. In this study we report the ability of bromoform to potentiate GABA-induced current in recombinant GABA(A) receptors composed of alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2s) subunits. Recent studies have shown that specific point mutations in the transmembrane (TM) region of the GABA(A) receptor alpha-subunit can selectively abolish the modulatory activity of specific general anesthetics, and that molecular volume is a key determinant of anesthetic activity. The action of bromoform was examined in a series of mutant receptors and compared with the activity profiles of three other volatile anesthetics. The pharmacological profile of bromoform at the mutant receptors used in this study was similar to that seen with halothane, and distinct from that observed for isoflurane and chloroform. The molecular volume of bromoform is closest to that of halothane, and therefore our data are consistent with the idea that molecular volume is an important determinant of inhaled anesthetic activity at the GABA(A) receptor.",

        "Title": "Prolongation of hippocampal miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in mice lacking the GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit.",
        "Abstract": "GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) are pentameric structures consisting of two alpha, two beta, and one gamma subunit. The alpha subunit influences agonist efficacy, benzodiazepine pharmacology, and kinetics of activation/deactivation. To investigate the contribution of the alpha1 subunit to native GABA(A)-Rs, we analyzed miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells and interneurons from wild-type (WT) and alpha1 subunit knock-out (alpha1 KO) mice. mIPSCs recorded from interneurons and pyramidal cells obtained from alpha1 KO mice were detected less frequently, were smaller in amplitude, and decayed more slowly than mIPSCs recorded in neurons from WT mice. The effect of zolpidem was examined in view of its reported selectivity for receptors containing the alpha1 subunit. In interneurons and pyramidal cells from WT mice, zolpidem significantly increased mIPSC frequency, prolonged mIPSC decay, and increased mIPSC amplitude; those effects were diminished or absent in neurons from alpha1 KO mice. Nonstationary fluctuation analysis of mIPSCs indicated that the zolpidem-induced increase in mIPSC amplitude was associated with an increase in the number of open receptors rather than a change in the unitary conductance of individual channels. These data indicate that the alpha1 subunit is present at synapses on WT interneurons and pyramidal cells, although differences in mIPSC decay times and zolpidem sensitivity suggest that the degree to which the alpha1 subunit is functionally expressed at synapses on CA1 interneurons may be greater than that at synapses on CA1 pyramidal cells.",

        "Title": "Tryptophan scanning mutagenesis in TM4 of the GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit: implications for modulation by inhaled anesthetics and ion channel structure.",
        "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown that amino acid residues in trans-membrane (TM) segments 1, 2 and 3 of the alpha subunit are critical for the enhancement of GABA(A) receptor function by inhaled anesthetics. In this study we used tryptophan (Trp) scanning mutagenesis between Ile 406 and Asn 417 in the alpha1 subunit to determine the effects of Trp substitution in the fourth transmembrane segment (TM4) on receptor gating and anesthetic modulation. Wild-type and mutant alpha1 subunits were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells with wild-type beta2 and gamma2s subunits and GABA-activated currents were recorded using whole-cell voltage clamp. The potentiation by three inhaled anesthetics (isoflurane, halothane and chloroform) of responses elicited by a submaximal concentration of GABA were also examined.EC(50) values for GABA at the mutant receptors were in the range 4-60 microM (wild-type=20 microM), indicating that Trp substitution can alter the apparent affinity of the receptor for GABA positively or negatively, dependent on position. The variation of the calculated EC(50) value for GABA exhibited an interesting periodicity, with the cycle length for each repeat corresponding to approximately 3.6 amino acids. These data are consistent with an alpha-helical structure for the TM4 segment of the alpha subunit. Several of these Trp point mutations altered the ability of one or more of the three inhaled anesthetics to modulate receptor function; four of the 12 mutations abolished receptor modulation by one or more of the anesthetics tested. These data are consistent with a role for these residues at the extracellular end of TM4 in anesthetic modulation of GABA(A) receptors.",

        "Abstract": "A training set of 27 propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) analogues was used to construct four-dimensional (4D) quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for three screens of biological activity: loss of righting reflex (LORR) in tadpoles, enhancement of agonist activity at the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor, and direct (agonist-independent) activation of the receptor. The three resulting 4D-QSAR models are almost identical in form, and all suggest three key ligand-receptor interaction sites. The formation of an intermolecular hydrogen bond involving the proton of the ligand -OH group is the most important binding interaction. A hydrophobic pocket binding interaction involving the six-substituent is the second most significant binding site, and a similar hydrophobic pocket binding interaction near the two-substituent is the third postulated binding site from the 4D-QSAR models. A test set of eight compounds was used to evaluate the tadpole LORR 4D-QSAR model. Those compounds highly congeneric to the training set compounds were accurately predicted. However, compounds exploring substituent sites and/or electronic structures different from the training set were less well-predicted. Overall, the results show a striking similarity between the models of the sites responsible for anesthesia and those mediating effects of the training set of propofol analogues on the GABA(A) receptor; it follows that the GABA(A) receptor is therefore the likely site of propofol's anesthetic action.",
