        "Abstract": "Structural biology is solving an ever-increasing number of snapshots of ion channel conformational ensembles. Deciphering ion channel mechanisms, however, requires understanding the ensemble dynamics beyond the static structures. Here, we present a molecular modeling-based approach characterizing the ion channel structural intermediates, or their \"dynamic molecular portraits\", by assessing water and ion conductivity along with the detailed evaluation of pore hydrophobicity and residue packing. We illustrate the power of this approach by analyzing structures of few vanilloid-subfamily transient receptor potential (TRPV) channels. Based on the pore architecture, there are three major states that are common for TRPVs, which we call \u03b1-closed, \u03c0-closed, and \u03c0-open. We show that the pore hydrophobicity and residue packing for the open state is most favorable for the pore conductance. On the contrary, the \u03b1-closed state is the most hydrophobic and always non-conducting. Our approach can also be used for structural and functional classification of ion channels.",

Physiologically relevant opening of TRPV3 channels by heat has been captured structurally, while opening by agonists has only been observed in structures of mutant channels. Here, we present cryo-EM structures that illuminate opening and inactivation of wild-type human TRPV3 in response to binding of two types of agonists: either the natural cannabinoid tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) or synthetic agonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane (2-APB). We found that THCV binds to the vanilloid site, while 2-APB binds to the S1-S4 base and ARD-TMD linker sites. Despite binding to distally located sites, both agonists induce similar pore opening and cause dissociation of a lipid that occupies the vanilloid site in their absence. Our results uncover different but converging allosteric pathways through which small-molecule agonists activate TRPV3 and provide a framework for drug design and understanding the role of lipids in ion channel function.",

        "Abstract": "TRP channels are implicated in various diseases, but high structural similarity between them makes selective pharmacological modulation challenging. Here, we study the molecular mechanism underlying specific inhibition of the TRPM7 channel, which is essential for cancer cell proliferation, by the anticancer agent CCT128930 (CCT). Using cryo-EM, functional analysis, and MD simulations, we show that CCT binds to a vanilloid-like (VL) site, stabilizing TRPM7 in the closed non-conducting state. Similar to other allosteric inhibitors of TRPM7, NS8593 and VER155008, binding of CCT is accompanied by displacement of a lipid that resides in the VL site in the apo condition. Moreover, we demonstrate the principal role of several residues in the VL site enabling CCT to inhibit TRPM7 without impacting the homologous TRPM6 channel. Hence, our results uncover the central role of the VL site for the selective interaction of TRPM7 with small molecules that can be explored in future drug design.",

In this review, we discuss the role of the two fastest iGluRs subtypes, namely, \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and kainate receptors, in the pathogenesis and treatment of Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although both AMPA and kainate receptors represent promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of these diseases, many of their antagonists show adverse side effects. Further studies of factors affecting the selective subunit expression and trafficking of AMPA and kainate receptors, and a reasonable approach to their regulation by the recently identified novel compounds remain promising directions for pharmacological research.",

        "Abstract": "TRPV6, a representative of the vanilloid subfamily of TRP channels, serves as the principal calcium uptake channel in the gut. Dysregulation of TRPV6 results in disturbed calcium homeostasis leading to a variety of human diseases, including many forms of cancer. Inhibitors of this oncochannel are therefore particularly needed. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advances in structural pharmacology that uncovered the molecular mechanisms of TRPV6 inhibition by a variety of small molecules, including synthetic and natural, plant-derived compounds as well as some prospective and clinically approved drugs.",

        "Abstract": "Synaptic complexes of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs) with auxiliary subunits mediate most excitatory neurotransmission and can be targeted to treat neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, including epilepsy. Here we present cryogenic-electron microscopy structures of rat GluA2 AMPAR complexes with inhibitory mouse \u03b35 and potentiating human cornichon-2 (CNIH2) auxiliary subunits. CNIH2 appears to destabilize the desensitized state of the complex by reducing the separation of the upper lobes in ligand-binding domain dimers. At the same time, CNIH2 stabilizes binding of polyamine spermidine to the selectivity filter of the closed ion channel. Nevertheless, CNIH2, and to a lesser extent \u03b35, attenuate polyamine block of the open channel and reduce the potency of the antiepileptic drug perampanel that inhibits the synaptic complex allosterically by binding to sites in the ion channel extracellular collar. These findings illustrate the fine-tuning of synaptic complex structure and function in an auxiliary subunit-dependent manner, which is critical for the study of brain region-specific neurotransmission and design of therapeutics for disease treatment.",

        "Abstract": "The calcium-selective oncochannel TRPV6 is an important driver of cell proliferation in human cancers. Despite increasing interest of pharmacological research in developing synthetic inhibitors of TRPV6, natural compounds acting at this channel have been largely neglected. On the other hand, pharmacokinetics of natural small-molecule antagonists optimized by nature throughout evolution endows these compounds with a medicinal potential to serve as potent and safe next-generation anti-cancer drugs. Here we report the structure of human TRPV6 in complex with tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), a natural cannabinoid inhibitor extracted from Cannabis sativa. We use cryo-electron microscopy combined with electrophysiology, calcium imaging, mutagenesis, and molecular dynamics simulations to identify THCV binding sites in the portals that connect the membrane environment surrounding the protein to the central cavity of the channel pore and to characterize the allosteric mechanism of TRPV6 inhibition. We also propose the molecular pathway taken by THCV to reach its binding site. Our study provides a foundation for the development of new TRPV6-targeting drugs.",

        "Abstract": "Transient receptor potential (TRP) channel TRPV4 is a polymodal cellular sensor that responds to moderate heat, cell swelling, shear stress, and small-molecule ligands. It is involved in thermogenesis, regulation of vascular tone, bone homeostasis, renal and pulmonary functions. TRPV4 is implicated in neuromuscular and skeletal disorders, pulmonary edema, and cancers, and represents an important drug target. The cytoskeletal remodeling GTPase RhoA has been shown to suppress TRPV4 activity. Here, we present a structure of the human TRPV4-RhoA complex that shows RhoA interaction with the membrane-facing surface of the TRPV4 ankyrin repeat domains. The contact interface reveals residues that are mutated in neuropathies, providing an insight into the disease pathogenesis. We also identify the binding sites of the TRPV4 agonist 4\u03b1-PDD and the inhibitor HC-067047 at the base of the S1-S4 bundle, and show that agonist binding leads to pore opening, while channel inhibition involves a \u03c0-to-\u03b1 transition in the pore-forming helix S6. Our structures elucidate the interaction interface between hTRPV4 and RhoA, as well as residues at this interface that are involved in TRPV4 disease-causing mutations. They shed light on TRPV4 activation and inhibition and provide a template for the design of future therapeutics for treatment of TRPV4-related diseases.",

Despite the pharmacological value, the molecular mechanism of TRPV6 inhibition by genistein has remained enigmatic. We use cryo-EM combined with electrophysiology, calcium imaging, mutagenesis, and molecular dynamics simulations to show that genistein binds in the intracellular half of the TRPV6 pore and acts as an ion channel blocker and gating modifier. Genistein binding to the open channel causes pore closure and a two-fold symmetrical conformational rearrangement in the S4-S5 and S6-TRP helix regions.

TRPM7 is implicated in neuronal and cardiovascular disorders, tumor progression and has emerged as a new drug target. Here we use cryo-EM, functional analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations to uncover two distinct structural mechanisms of TRPM7 activation by a gain-of-function mutation and by the agonist naltriben, which show different conformational dynamics and domain involvement. We identify a binding site for highly potent and selective inhibitors and show that they act by stabilizing the TRPM7 closed state.

        "Abstract": "Pain therapy has remained conceptually stagnant since the opioid crisis, which highlighted the dangers of treating pain with opioids. An alternative addiction-free strategy to conventional painkiller-based treatment is targeting receptors at the origin of the pain pathway, such as transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. Thus, a founding member of the vanilloid subfamily of TRP channels, TRPV1, represents one of the most sought-after pain therapy targets. The need for selective TRPV1 inhibitors extends beyond pain treatment, to other diseases associated with this channel, including psychiatric disorders. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of human TRPV1 in the apo state and in complex with the TRPV1-specific nanomolar-affinity analgesic antagonist SB-366791. SB-366791 binds to the vanilloid site and acts as an allosteric hTRPV1 inhibitor. SB-366791 binding site is supported by mutagenesis combined with electrophysiological recordings and can be further explored to design new drugs targeting TRPV1 in disease conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Kainate receptors (KARs) are a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors that control synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and are implicated in neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Understanding the regulation of KAR function by small molecules is essential for exploring these receptors as drug targets. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of KAR GluK2 in complex with the positive allosteric modulator BPAM344, competitive antagonist DNQX, and negative allosteric modulator, antiepileptic drug perampanel. Our structures show that two BPAM344 molecules bind per ligand-binding domain dimer interface. In the absence of an agonist or in the presence of DNQX, BPAM344 stabilizes GluK2 in the closed state. The closed state is also stabilized by perampanel, which binds to the ion channel extracellular collar sites located in two out of four GluK2 subunits. The molecular mechanisms of positive and negative allosteric modulation of KAR provide a guide for developing new therapeutic strategies.",

        "Abstract": "Vanilloid-subfamily TRP channels TRPV1-6 play important roles in various physiological processes and are implicated in numerous human diseases. Advances in structural biology, particularly the \"resolution revolution\" in cryo-EM, have led to breakthroughs in molecular characterization of TRPV channels. Structures with continuously improving resolution uncover atomic details of TRPV channel interactions with small molecules and protein-binding partners. Here, we provide a classification of structurally characterized binding sites in TRPV channels and discuss the progress that has been made by structural biology combined with mutagenesis, functional recordings, and molecular dynamics simulations toward understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ligand action. Given the similarity in structural architecture of TRP channels, 16 unique sites identified in TRPV channels may be shared between TRP channel subfamilies, although the chemical identity of a particular ligand will likely depend on the local amino-acid composition. The characterized binding sites and molecular mechanisms of ligand action create a diversity of druggable targets to aid in the design of new molecules for tuning TRP channel function in disease conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are polymodal sensors that play critical roles in various physiological processes in living organisms. These cation-permeable channels respond to a variety of physical and chemical stimuli, including cold and hot temperatures, acidic pH, and mechanical stress, often determining a sensory frontier of defense against hostile environments. Vanilloid (V) subfamily is the most studied category of TRP channels that includes six closely related members: highly calcium-selective TRPV5-6 and non-selective TRPV1-4. A remarkable feature of TRPV1-4 is their ability to sense heat, which makes them temperature-sensitive TRP channels or thermo-TRPs. TRPV channels are associated with a multitude of human diseases, including cancers, chronic pain, cardiovascular, neurological and nociceptive disorders. Despite the great clinical interest, pharmacology of TRPV channels remains largely undeveloped because of insufficient knowledge about the mechanisms of their regulation. For instance, activation of TRPV channels by small molecules or heat remains poorly understood. Numerous identified TRPV channel agonists, while effective in physiological experiments, appear limited in their ability to act in the conditions of structural biology experiments. In this regard, the recent study by Pumroy et\u00a0al. [1] makes a significant contribution towards our understanding of TRPV2 structural dynamics that leads to opening of this channel in physiological conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Skin diseases are common human illnesses that occur in all cultures, at all ages, and affect between 30% and 70% of individuals globally. TRPV3 is a cation-permeable TRP channel predominantly expressed in skin keratinocytes, implicated in cutaneous sensation and associated with numerous skin diseases. TRPV3 is inhibited by the local anesthetic dyclonine, traditionally used for topical applications to relieve pain and itch. However, the structural basis of TRPV3 inhibition by dyclonine has remained elusive. Here we present a cryo-EM structure of a\u00a0TRPV3-dyclonine complex that reveals binding of the inhibitor in the portals which connect the membrane environment surrounding the channel to the central cavity of the channel pore. We propose a mechanism of TRPV3 inhibition in which dyclonine molecules stick out into the channel pore, creating a barrier for ion conductance. The allosteric binding site of dyclonine can serve as a template for the design of new TRPV3-targeting drugs.",

With improvements in its design, specificity, and sensitivity, GEM-IL allows new applications compared with the previous lactate indicators, Laconic and Green Lindoblum.

        "Title": "Structure, Function, and Pharmacology of Glutamate Receptor Ion Channels.",
        "Abstract": "Many physiologic effects of l-glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, are mediated via signaling by ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). These ligand-gated ion channels are critical to brain function and are centrally implicated in numerous psychiatric and neurologic disorders. There are different classes of iGluRs with a variety of receptor subtypes in each class that play distinct roles in neuronal functions. The diversity in iGluR subtypes, with their unique functional properties and physiologic roles, has motivated a large number of studies. Our understanding of receptor subtypes has advanced considerably since the first iGluR subunit gene was cloned in 1989, and the research focus has expanded to encompass facets of biology that have been recently discovered and to exploit experimental paradigms made possible by technological advances. Here, we review insights from more than 3 decades of iGluR studies with an emphasis on the progress that has occurred in the past decade. We cover structure, function, pharmacology, roles in neurophysiology, and therapeutic implications for all classes of receptors assembled from the subunits encoded by the 18 ionotropic glutamate receptor genes. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Glutamate receptors play important roles in virtually all aspects of brain function and are either involved in mediating some clinical features of neurological disease or represent a therapeutic target for treatment. Therefore, understanding the structure, function, and pharmacology of this class of receptors will advance our understanding of many aspects of brain function at molecular, cellular, and system levels and provide new opportunities to treat patients.",

        "Abstract": "AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission. Their surface expression, trafficking, gating, and pharmacology are regulated by auxiliary subunits. Of the two types of TARP auxiliary subunits, type I TARPs assume activating roles, while type II TARPs serve suppressive functions. We present cryo-EM structures of GluA2 AMPAR in complex with type II TARP \u03b35, which reduces steady-state currents, increases single-channel conductance, and slows recovery from desensitization. Regulation of AMPAR function depends on its ligand-binding domain (LBD) interaction with the \u03b35 head domain. GluA2-\u03b35 complex shows maximum stoichiometry of two TARPs per AMPAR tetramer, being different from type I TARPs but reminiscent of the auxiliary subunit GSG1L. Desensitization of both GluA2-GSG1L and GluA2-\u03b35 complexes is accompanied by rupture of LBD dimer interface, while GluA2-\u03b35 but not GluA2-GSG1L LBD dimers remain two-fold symmetric. Different structural architectures and desensitization mechanisms of complexes with auxiliary subunits endow AMPARs with broad functional capabilities.",

        "Abstract": "TRPV3, a representative of the vanilloid subfamily of TRP channels, is predominantly expressed in skin keratinocytes and has been implicated in cutaneous sensation and associated with numerous skin pathologies and cancers. TRPV3 is inhibited by the natural coumarin derivative osthole, an active ingredient of Cnidium monnieri, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of a variety of human diseases. However, the structural basis of channel inhibition by osthole has remained elusive. Here we present cryo-EM structures of TRPV3 in complex with osthole, revealing two types of osthole binding sites in the transmembrane region of TRPV3 that coincide with the binding sites of agonist 2-APB. Osthole binding converts the channel pore into a previously unidentified conformation with a widely open selectivity filter and closed intracellular gate. Our structures provide insight into competitive inhibition of TRPV3 by osthole and can serve as a template for the design of osthole chemistry-inspired drugs targeting TRPV3-associated diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Numerous physiological functions rely on distinguishing temperature through temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential channels (thermo-TRPs). Although the function of thermo-TRPs has been studied extensively, structural determination of their heat- and cold-activated states has remained a challenge. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the nanodisc-reconstituted wild-type mouse TRPV3 in three distinct conformations: closed, heat-activated sensitized and open states. The heat-induced transformations of TRPV3 are accompanied by changes in the secondary structure of the S2-S3 linker and the N and C termini and represent a conformational wave that links these parts of the protein to a lipid occupying the vanilloid binding site. State-dependent differences in the behavior of bound lipids suggest their active role in thermo-TRP temperature-dependent gating. Our structural data, supported by physiological recordings and molecular dynamics simulations, provide an insight for understanding the molecular mechanism of temperature sensing.",

Despite the importance of GLRs, knowledge about their molecular organization is limited. Here we use X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-EM to solve structures of the Arabidopsis thaliana GLR3.4. Our structures reveal the tetrameric assembly of GLR3.4 subunits into a three-layer domain architecture, reminiscent of animal ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). However, the non-swapped arrangement between layers of GLR3.4 domains, binding of glutathione through S-glutathionylation of cysteine C205 inside the amino-terminal domain clamshell, unique symmetry, inter-domain interfaces, and ligand specificity distinguish GLR3.4 from representatives of the iGluR family and suggest distinct features of the GLR gating mechanism. Our work elaborates on the principles of GLR architecture and symmetry and provides a molecular template for deciphering GLR-dependent signaling mechanisms in plants.",

Several structures of the founding member of the TRP channel family, TRPV1, are available, all of which were determined for the protein missing the N- and C-termini and the extracellular S5-P-loop. Here, we present structures of the full-length thirteen-lined ground squirrel TRPV1 solved by cryo-EM. Our structures resolve the extracellular cap domain formed by the S5-P-loops and the C-terminus that wraps around the three-stranded \u03b2-sheet connecting elements of the TRPV1 intracellular skirt. The cap domain forms a dome above the pore's extracellular entrance, with four portals leading to the ion conductance pathway. Deletion of the cap increases the TRPV1 average conductance, reduces the open probability and affects ion selectivity. Our data show that both the termini and the cap domain are critical determinants of TRPV1 function.",

        "Abstract": "Epithelial calcium channel TRPV6 plays vital roles in calcium homeostasis, and its dysregulation is implicated in multifactorial diseases, including cancers. Here, we study the molecular mechanism of selective nanomolar-affinity TRPV6 inhibition by (4-phenylcyclohexyl)piperazine derivatives (PCHPDs). We use x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy to solve the inhibitor-bound structures of TRPV6 and identify two types of inhibitor binding sites in the transmembrane region: (i) modulatory sites between the S1-S4 and pore domains normally occupied by lipids and (ii) the main site in the ion channel pore. Our structural data combined with mutagenesis, functional and computational approaches suggest that PCHPDs plug the open pore of TRPV6 and convert the channel into a nonconducting state, mimicking the action of calmodulin, which causes inactivation of TRPV6 channels under physiological conditions. This mechanism of inhibition explains the high selectivity and potency of PCHPDs and opens up unexplored avenues for the design of future-generation biomimetic drugs.",

        "Abstract": "Glutamate receptor-like channels (GLRs) play important roles in numerous plant physiological processes. GLRs are homologous to ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) that mediate neurotransmission in vertebrates. Here we determine crystal structures of Arabidopsis thaliana GLR3.2 ligand-binding domain (LBD) in complex with glycine and methionine to 1.58- and 1.75-\u00c5 resolution, respectively. Our structures show a fold similar to that of iGluRs, but with several secondary structure elements either missing or different. The closed clamshell conformation of GLR3.2 LBD suggests that both glycine and methionine act as agonists. The mutation R133A strongly increases the constitutive activity of the channel, suggesting that the LBD mutated at the residue critical for agonist binding produces a more stable closed clamshell conformation. Furthermore, our structures explain the promiscuity of GLR activation by different amino acids, confirm evolutionary conservation of structure between GLRs and iGluRs, and predict common molecular principles of their gating mechanisms driven by bilobed clamshell-like LBDs.",

        "Abstract": "Glutamate receptors are essential ligand-gated ion channels in the central nervous system that mediate excitatory synaptic transmission in response to the release of glutamate from presynaptic terminals. The structural and biophysical basis underlying the function of these receptors has been studied for decades by a wide range of approaches. However recent structural, pharmacological and genetic studies have provided new insight into the regions of this protein that are critical determinants of receptor function. Lack of variation in specific areas of the protein amino acid sequences in the human population has defined three regions in each receptor subunit that are under selective pressure, which has focused research efforts and driven new hypotheses. In addition, these three closely positioned elements reside near a cavity that is shown by multiple studies to be a likely site of action for allosteric modulators, one of which is currently in use as an FDA-approved anticonvulsant. These structural elements are capable of controlling gating of the pore, and appear to permit some modulators bound within the cavity to also alter permeation properties. This creates a new precedent whereby features of the channel pore can be modulated by exogenous drugs that bind outside the pore. The convergence of structural, genetic, biophysical and pharmacological approaches is a powerful means to gain insight into the complex biological processes defined by neurotransmitter receptor function.",

        "Abstract": "Fast excitatory neurotransmission is mediated by the \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor (AMPAR). AMPARs initiate depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron by allowing cations to enter through their ion channel pores in response to binding of the neurotransmitter glutamate. AMPAR function is dramatically affected by auxiliary subunits, which are regulatory proteins that form various complexes with AMPARs throughout the brain. The most well-studied auxiliary subunits are the transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs), which alter the assembly, trafficking, localization, kinetics, and pharmacology of AMPARs. Recent structural and functional studies of TARPs and the TARP-fold germ cell-specific gene 1-like (GSG1L) subunit have provided important glimpses into how auxiliary subunits regulate the function of synaptic complexes. In this review, we put these recent structures in the context of new functional findings in order to gain insight into the determinants of AMPAR regulation by TARPs. We thus reveal why TARPs display a broad range of effects despite their conserved modular architecture.",

        "Abstract": "The vanilloid transient receptor potential channel TRPV3 is a putative molecular thermosensor widely considered to be involved in cutaneous sensation, skin homeostasis, nociception, and pruritus. Repeated stimulation of TRPV3 by high temperatures above 50 \u00b0C progressively increases its responses and shifts the activation threshold to physiological temperatures. This use-dependence does not occur in the related heat-sensitive TRPV1 channel in which responses decrease, and the activation threshold is retained above 40 \u00b0C during activations. By combining structure-based mutagenesis, electrophysiology, and molecular modeling, we showed that chimeric replacement of the residues from the TRPV3 cytoplasmic inter-subunit interface (N251-E257) with the homologous residues of TRPV1 resulted in channels that, similarly to TRPV1, exhibited a lowered thermal threshold, were sensitized, and failed to close completely after intense stimulation. Crosslinking of this interface by the engineered disulfide bridge between substituted cysteines F259C and V385C (or, to a lesser extent, Y382C) locked the channel in an open state. On the other hand, mutation of a single residue within this region (E736) resulted in heat resistant channels. We propose that alterations in the cytoplasmic inter-subunit interface produce shifts in the channel gating equilibrium and that this domain is critical for the use-dependence of the heat sensitivity of TRPV3.",

Channel opening is accompanied by conformational changes in both the outer pore and the intracellular gate. The gate is formed by the pore-lining S6 helices that undergo local \u03b1-to-\u03c0 helical transitions, elongate, rotate, and splay apart in the open state. In the closed state, the shorter S6 segments are entirely \u03b1-helical, expose their nonpolar surfaces to the pore, and hydrophobically seal the ion permeation pathway. These findings further illuminate TRP channel activation and can aid in the design of drugs for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions, itch, and pain.",

To address this problem, we used cryo-electron microscopy and electrophysiology to investigate the mechanisms by which small-molecule blockers selectively inhibit ion channel conductance in calcium-permeable AMPA receptors. We determined the structures of calcium-permeable GluA2 AMPA receptor complexes with the auxiliary subunit stargazin bound to channel blockers, including the orb weaver spider toxin AgTx-636, the spider toxin analog NASPM, and the adamantane derivative IEM-1460. Our structures provide insights into the architecture of the blocker\u00a0binding site and the mechanism of trapping, which are critical for development of small molecules that specifically target calcium-permeable AMPA receptors.",

        "Abstract": "Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are involved in various physiological processes, including sensory transduction. The TRP channel TRPV6 mediates calcium uptake in epithelia and its expression is dramatically increased in numerous types of cancer. TRPV6 inhibitors suppress tumor growth, but the molecular mechanism of inhibition remains unknown. Here, we present crystal and cryo-EM structures of human and rat TRPV6 bound to 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), a TRPV6 inhibitor and modulator of numerous TRP channels. 2-APB binds to TRPV6 in a pocket formed by the cytoplasmic half of the S1-S4 transmembrane helix bundle. Comparing human wild-type and high-affinity mutant Y467A structures, we show that 2-APB induces TRPV6 channel closure by modulating protein-lipid interactions. Mutagenesis and functional analyses suggest that the identified 2-APB binding site might be present in other members of vanilloid subfamily TRP channels. Our findings reveal a mechanism of ion channel allosteric modulation that can be exploited for therapeutic design.",

        "Abstract": "Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. iGluRs open their ion channels in response to binding of the neurotransmitter glutamate, rapidly depolarize the postsynaptic neuronal membrane, and initiate signal transduction. Recent studies using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy have determined full-length iGluR structures that (1) uncover the receptor architecture in an unliganded, resting state, (2) reveal conformational changes produced by ligands in order to activate iGluRs, open their ion channels, and conduct ions, and (3) show how activated, glutamate-bound iGluRs can adopt a nonconducting desensitized state. These new findings, combined with the results of previous structural and functional experiments, kinetic and molecular modeling, mutagenesis, and biochemical analyses, provide new views on the structural mechanisms of iGluR gating.",

Gated by the neurotransmitter glutamate, AMPA receptors are critical for synaptic strength, and dysregulation of AMPA receptor-mediated signalling is linked to numerous neurological diseases. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to solve the structures of AMPA receptor-auxiliary subunit complexes in the apo, antagonist- and agonist-bound states and determine the iris-like mechanism of ion channel opening. The ion channel selectivity filter is formed by the extended portions of the re-entrant M2 loops, while the helical portions of M2 contribute to extensive hydrophobic interfaces between AMPA receptor subunits in the ion channel. We show how the permeation pathway changes upon channel opening and identify conformational changes throughout the entire AMPA receptor that accompany activation and desensitization. Our findings provide a framework for understanding gating across the family of ionotropic glutamate receptors and the role of AMPA receptors in excitatory neurotransmission.",

AMPARs, localized at post-synaptic densities, are regulated by transmembrane auxiliary subunits that modulate AMPAR assembly, trafficking, gating, and pharmacology. Aberrancies in AMPAR-mediated signaling are associated with numerous neurological disorders. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of an AMPAR in complex with the auxiliary subunit GSG1L in the closed and desensitized states. GSG1L favors the AMPAR desensitized state, where channel closure is facilitated by profound structural rearrangements in the AMPAR extracellular domain, with ligand-binding domain dimers losing their local 2-fold rotational symmetry. Our structural and functional experiments suggest that AMPAR auxiliary subunits share a modular architecture and use a common transmembrane scaffold for\u00a0distinct extracellular modules to differentially regulate AMPAR gating. By comparing the AMPAR-GSG1L complex structures, we map conformational changes accompanying AMPAR recovery from desensitization and reveal structural bases for regulation of synaptic transmission by auxiliary subunits.",

        "Abstract": "AMPA subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission and are implicated in numerous neurological diseases. Ionic currents through AMPA receptor channels can be allosterically regulated via different sites on the receptor protein. We used site-directed mutagenesis and patch-clamp recordings to probe the ion channel extracellular collar, the binding region for noncompetitive allosteric inhibitors. We found position and substitution-dependent effects for introduced mutations at this region on AMPA receptor gating. The results of mutagenesis suggested that the transmembrane domains M1, M3 and M4, which contribute to the ion channel extracellular collar, undergo significant relative displacement during gating. We used molecular dynamics simulations to predict an AMPA receptor open state structure and rationalize the results of mutagenesis. We conclude that the ion channel extracellular collar plays a distinct role in gating and represents a hub for powerful allosteric modulation of AMPA receptor function that can be used for developing novel therapeutics.",

Correspondingly, AMPA-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors, which mediate the\u00a0majority of excitatory neurotransmission and contribute to seizure generation and spread, have emerged as promising targets for epilepsy therapy. The most potent and well-tolerated AMPA receptor inhibitors act via a noncompetitive mechanism, but many of them produce adverse side effects. The design of better drugs is hampered by the lack of a structural understanding of noncompetitive inhibition. Here, we report crystal structures of the rat AMPA-subtype GluA2 receptor in complex with three noncompetitive inhibitors. The inhibitors bind to a novel binding site, completely conserved between rat and human, at the interface between the ion channel and linkers connecting it to the ligand-binding domains. We propose that the inhibitors stabilize the AMPA receptor closed state by acting as wedges between the transmembrane segments, thereby preventing gating rearrangements that are necessary for ion channel opening.",

In the brain, AMPAR trafficking, gating, and pharmacology is tightly controlled by transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the structural basis of AMPAR regulation by one of these auxiliary proteins, TARP \u03b32, or stargazin (STZ). Our structures illuminate the variable interaction stoichiometry of the AMPAR-TARP complex, with one or two TARP molecules binding one tetrameric AMPAR. Analysis of the AMPAR-STZ binding interfaces suggests that electrostatic interactions between the extracellular domains of AMPAR and STZ play an important role in modulating AMPAR function through contact surfaces that are conserved across AMPARs and TARPs. We propose a model explaining how TARPs stabilize the activated state of AMPARs and how the interactions between AMPARs and their auxiliary proteins control fast excitatory synaptic transmission.",

        "Abstract": "Precise regulation of calcium homeostasis is essential for many physiological functions. The Ca(2+)-selective transient receptor potential (TRP) channels TRPV5 and TRPV6 play vital roles in calcium homeostasis as Ca(2+) uptake channels in epithelial tissues. Detailed structural bases for their assembly and Ca(2+) permeation remain obscure. Here we report the crystal structure of rat TRPV6 at 3.25\u2009\u00c5 resolution. The overall architecture of TRPV6 reveals shared and unique features compared with other TRP channels. Intracellular domains engage in extensive interactions to form an intracellular 'skirt' involved in allosteric modulation. In the K(+) channel-like transmembrane domain, Ca(2+) selectivity is determined by direct coordination of Ca(2+) by a ring of aspartate side chains in the selectivity filter. On the basis of crystallographically identified cation-binding sites at the pore axis and extracellular vestibule, we propose a Ca(2+) permeation mechanism. Our results provide a structural foundation for understanding the regulation of epithelial Ca(2+) uptake and its role in pathophysiology.",

        "Abstract": "AMPA subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) mediate the majority of fast neurotransmission across excitatory synapses in the central nervous system. Each AMPA receptor is composed of four multi-domain subunits that are organized into layers of two amino-terminal domain (ATD) dimers, two ligand-binding domain (LBD) dimers, transmembrane domains and carboxy-terminal domains. We introduced cysteine substitutions at the intersubunit interfaces of AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 and confirmed substituted cysteine crosslink formation by SDS-PAGE. The functional consequence of intersubunit crosslinks was assessed by recording GluA2-mediated currents in reducing and non-reducing conditions. Strong redox-dependent changes in GluA2-mediated currents were observed for cysteine substitutions at the LBD dimer-dimer interface but not at the ATD dimer-dimer interface. We conclude that during gating, LBD dimers undergo significant relative displacement, while ATD dimers either maintain their relative positioning, or their relative displacement has no appreciable effect on AMPA receptor function.",

        "Abstract": "Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that open their ion-conducting pores in response to the binding of agonist glutamate. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in studies of iGluRs by determining numerous structures of isolated water-soluble ligand-binding and amino-terminal domains, as well as solving the first crystal structure of the full-length AMPA receptor in the closed, antagonist-bound state. These structural data combined with electrophysiological and fluorescence recordings, biochemical experiments, mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations have greatly improved our understanding of iGluR assembly, activation and desensitization processes. This article reviews the recent structural and functional advances in the iGluR field and summarizes them in a simplified model of full-length iGluR gating.",

Here, superresolved images and diffusion maps of membrane proteins are obtained on living cells. The method consists of recording thousands of single-molecule trajectories that appear sequentially on a cell surface upon continuously labeling molecules of interest. It allows studying any molecules that can be labeled with fluorescent ligands including endogenous membrane proteins on living cells. This approach, named universal PAINT (uPAINT), generalizes the previously developed point-accumulation-for-imaging-in-nanoscale-topography (PAINT) method for dynamic imaging of arbitrary membrane biomolecules. We show here that the unprecedented large statistics obtained by uPAINT on single cells reveal local diffusion properties of specific proteins, either in distinct membrane compartments of adherent cells or in neuronal synapses.",

        "Abstract": "Ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate most excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system and function by opening a transmembrane ion channel upon binding of glutamate. Despite their crucial role in neurobiology, the architecture and atomic structure of an intact ionotropic glutamate receptor are unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)-sensitive, homotetrameric, rat GluA2 receptor at 3.6 A resolution in complex with a competitive antagonist. The receptor harbours an overall axis of two-fold symmetry with the extracellular domains organized as pairs of local dimers and with the ion channel domain exhibiting four-fold symmetry. A symmetry mismatch between the extracellular and ion channel domains is mediated by two pairs of conformationally distinct subunits, A/C and B/D. Therefore, the stereochemical manner in which the A/C subunits are coupled to the ion channel gate is different from the B/D subunits. Guided by the GluA2 structure and site-directed cysteine mutagenesis, we suggest that GluN1 and GluN2A NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors have a similar architecture, with subunits arranged in a 1-2-1-2 pattern. We exploit the GluA2 structure to develop mechanisms of ion channel activation, desensitization and inhibition by non-competitive antagonists and pore blockers.",

For all receptor subfamilies, active channels are exclusively formed by assemblages of subunits within the same subfamily, a molecular process principally encoded by the amino-terminal domain (ATD). However, the molecular basis by which the ATD guides subfamily-specific receptor assembly is not known. Here we show that AMPA receptor GluR1- and GluR2-ATDs form tightly associated dimers and, by the analysis of crystal structures of the GluR2-ATD, propose mechanisms by which the ATD guides subfamily-specific receptor assembly.",

        "Title": "Subunit-specific contribution of pore-forming domains to NMDA receptor channel structure and gating.",
        "Abstract": "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are ligand-gated ion channels that contribute to fundamental physiological processes such as learning and memory and, when dysfunctional, to pathophysiological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, and mental illness. NMDARs are obligate heteromultimers typically composed of NR1 and NR2 subunits with the different subunits underlying the functional versatility of NMDARs. To study the contribution of the different subunits to NMDAR channel structure and gating, we compared the effects of cysteine-reactive agents on cysteines substituted in and around the M1, M3, and M4 segments of the NR1 and NR2C subunits. Based on the voltage dependence of cysteine modification, we find that, both in NR1 and NR2C, M3 appears to be the only transmembrane segment that contributes to the deep (or voltage dependent) portion of the ion channel pore. This contribution, however, is subunit specific with more positions in NR1 than in NR2C facing the central pore. Complimentarily, NR2C makes a greater contribution than NR1 to the shallow (or voltage independent) portion of the pore with more NR2C positions in pre-M1 and M3-S2 linker lining the ion-conducting pathway. Substituted cysteines in the M3 segments in NR1 and NR2C showed strong, albeit different, state-dependent reactivity, suggesting that they play central but structurally distinct roles in gating. A weaker state dependence was observed for the pre-M1 regions in both subunits. Compared to M1 and M3, the M4 segments in both NR1 and NR2C subunits had limited accessibility and the weakest state dependence, suggesting that they are peripheral to the central pore. Finally, we propose that Lurcher mutation-like effects, which were identified in and around all three transmembrane segments, occur for positions located at dynamic protein-protein or protein-lipid interfaces that have state-dependent accessibility to methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents and therefore can affect the equilibrium between open and closed states following reactions with MTS reagents.",

        "Abstract": "The M2 loop and the M3 segment are the major pore-lining domains in the GluR channel. These domains determine ion permeation and channel block processes and are extensively involved in gating. To study the distribution of the membrane electric potential across the GluR channel pore, we recorded from alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid receptors containing M2 and M3 cysteine substitutions in the GluR-A subunit and measured the voltage dependence of the modification rate of these substituted cysteines by methanethiosulfonate reagents either in the presence or absence of glutamate. In the presence of glutamate, the voltage dependence became gradually stronger for positions located deeper in the pore suggesting that the electrostatic potential drops fairly uniformly across the pore in the open state. In contrast, in the absence of glutamate, the voltage dependence was biphasic. The difference in the electrostatic potential in the presence and absence of glutamate had an apparent maximum in the middle of the extracellular vestibule. We suggest that these state-dependent changes in the membrane electric potential reflect a reorientation of the dipoles of the M2 loop alpha-helices toward and away from the center of the channel pore during gating.",

        "Abstract": "Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate rapid information transfer at most excitatory synapses in the brain. Crystal structures are now available for the ligand-binding domain, but the structure of the ion channel itself remains unknown. The core of the ion channel shares structural features with an inverted K(+) channel. In detail, however, differences are emerging. Most notable in the glutamate receptor ion channel are distinct structural and functional properties of a major pore-lining domain, the requirement of an additional transmembrane segment (M4), and twofold rather than fourfold symmetry. Together with ligand-binding domain structures and kinetic experiments, these findings have started to define the basic principles of channel gating in glutamate receptors.",

        "Title": "Block of AMPA receptor desensitization by a point mutation outside the ligand-binding domain.",
        "Abstract": "Desensitization of ionotropic glutamate receptors (GluRs), specifically the AMPA receptor subtype, shapes the postsynaptic response at certain synapses in the brain. All known mechanisms that alter desensitization, either pharmacological or mutational, are associated with the ligand-binding domain. Here we report that substitution of a conserved positively charged arginine (R) with a negatively charged glutamate in the linker between the pore-forming M3 segment and the S2 lobe, a region outside the ligand-binding domain, blocks desensitization in homomeric AMPA receptors composed of GluR-B(i) subunits. A charge-reversing substitution of a glutamate adjacent to this conserved R enhanced desensitization, consistent with these effects attributable to electrostatics. Homologous substitutions of the conserved R in GluR-B(o), GluR-A(i) and the kainate receptor GluR-6 subunits produced comparable but less visible effects on desensitization. Subunit specificity was also apparent for accessibility of substituted cysteines in the M3-S2 linker, suggesting that this part of the channel is not structurally identical in different GluRs. Additionally, reactivity with a sulfhydryl-specific reagent was state dependent, suggesting that the conformations of the nonconducting closed and desensitized states are different at the level of the M3-S2 linker. Our results therefore represent the first identification of elements outside the ligand-binding domain affecting desensitization in non-NMDA receptor channels and suggest that electrostatic interactions involving charged residues in the M3-S2 linker influence channel gating in a subunit- and subtype-specific manner.",

Here we used substituted cysteines in the pore-lining M3 segment of the AMPAR GluR-A subunit and various cysteine-reactive agents to study the structure of the channel during gating. We find that cysteines substituted at A+6, located in the highly conserved SYTANLAAF motif, are grouped in pairs consistent with a 2-fold symmetry in the extracellular part of the pore. To account for this symmetry and crosslinking, we propose that the M3 segments in two neighboring GluR subunits are kinked within SYTANLAAF in opposite directions relative to the central axis of the pore. Our results extend the 2-fold rotational symmetry from the ligand binding domain to at minimum the extracellular part of the channel and suggest a model of gating movements in GluR pore-forming domains.",

        "Abstract": "The basic structural features of channel gating in glutamate receptors (GluRs) remain unknown. Here we used covalent modification of substituted cysteines and fast agonist application to study the contribution of the M3 segment in AMPA receptor GluR-A subunits to channel structure and gating. The pattern of accessibility of substituted cysteines to extracellularly applied methanethiosulfonate reagents and the rates of their modification by these reagents, measured in either the presence or absence of glutamate, indicate that M3 forms an alpha-helix that lines the pore of the channel and is involved in gating-related movements. The voltage dependence of modification rates places the tip of the M2 loop (the Q/R site) close to the middle of M3. All of these results are consistent with pore-forming domains in GluR and K+ channels having a similar structure but inverted membrane topology. Nevertheless, GluRs lack a glycine residue at a homologous structural position as the gating hinge glycine in K+ channels. Moreover, simultaneous substitution of the only two glycines in M3 of GluR-A with alanines produced channels with gating properties indistinguishable from wild type. Given the unique role of glycines in the flexibility ofalpha-helices, our results indicate that the M3 segment in GluR does not contain a glycine gating hinge and suggest that, in contrast to the homologous domain in K+ channels, M3 is rigid during gating. The different positioning and functional significance of glycines in a key structural domain may represent the basis for the distinct features of gating in GluR and K+ channels.",

The M3 segment, as contributed by NR1, forms the core of the extracellular vestibule, including binding sites for channel blockers, and represents a critical molecular link between ligand binding and channel opening. Taking advantage of the substituted cysteine accessibility method along with channel block and multivalent coordination, we studied the contribution of the M3 segment in NR2C to the extracellular vestibule. We find that the M3 segment in NR2C, like that in NR1, contributes to the core of the extracellular vestibule. However, the M3 segments from the two subunits are staggered relative to each other in the vertical axis of the channel. Compared to NR1, homologous positions in NR2C, including those in the highly conserved SYTANLAAF motif, are located about four amino acids more externally. The staggering of subunits may represent a key structural feature underlying the distinct functional properties of NMDARs.",

        "Abstract": "Many N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) channel blockers that have therapeutic potential can be trapped in the closed state. Using a combination of the substituted cysteine accessibility method and open channel blockers, we found that the M3 segment forms the core of the extracellular vestibule, including a deep site for trapping blockers. The M3 segment, as well as more superficial parts of the extracellular vestibule, undergo extensive remodeling during channel closure, but do not define the activation gate, which is located deeper in the pore. Rather, the pore walls lining the extracellular vestibule constrict during channel closure. This movement is essential for coupling ligand binding to activation gate opening and accounts for the different mechanisms of open channel block, including trapping.",
