This study builds on the body of literature around deprivation indices to construct an individual socioeconomic deprivation index (ISDI) within the NIH's All of Us Data Network by using weighted multiple correspondence analysis on SDOH data elements collected at the participant level. In this study, the correlation between ISDI and another area-approximated index is assessed to the extent possible, along with the changes in an AI models performance due to stratified sampling based on ISDI quintiles. Individual level deprivation indices may have a wide range of utility particularly in the context of precision medicine in both centralized and distributed data networks.",

        "Abstract": "In September 2023, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended updated 2023-2024 (monovalent XBB.1.5) COVID-19 vaccination for all persons aged \u22656 months to prevent COVID-19, including severe disease. As with past COVID-19 vaccines, additional doses may be considered for persons with immunocompromising conditions, who are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 and might have decreased response to vaccination. In this analysis, vaccine effectiveness (VE) of an updated COVID-19 vaccine dose against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was evaluated during September 2023-February 2024 using data from the VISION VE network. Among adults aged \u226518 years with immunocompromising conditions, VE against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was 38% in the 7-59 days after receipt of an updated vaccine dose and 34% in the 60-119 days after receipt of an updated dose. Few persons (18%) in this high-risk study population had received updated COVID-19 vaccine. All persons aged \u22656 months should receive updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccination; persons with immunocompromising conditions may get additional updated COVID-19 vaccine doses \u22652 months after the last recommended COVID-19 vaccine.",

        "Abstract": "In September 2023, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended updated 2023-2024 (monovalent XBB.1.5) COVID-19 vaccination for all persons aged \u22656 months to prevent COVID-19, including severe disease. However, few estimates of updated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medically attended illness are available. This analysis evaluated VE of an updated COVID-19 vaccine dose against COVID-19-associated emergency department (ED) or urgent care (UC) encounters and hospitalization among immunocompetent adults aged \u226518 years during September 2023-January 2024 using a test-negative, case-control design with data from two CDC VE networks. VE against COVID-19-associated ED/UC encounters was 51% (95% CI = 47%-54%) during the first 7-59 days after an updated dose and 39% (95% CI = 33%-45%) during the 60-119 days after an updated dose. VE estimates against COVID-19-associated hospitalization from two CDC VE networks were 52% (95% CI = 47%-57%) and 43% (95% CI = 27%-56%), with a median interval from updated dose of 42 and 47 days, respectively. Updated COVID-19 vaccine provided increased protection against COVID-19-associated ED/UC encounters and hospitalization among immunocompetent adults. These results support CDC recommendations for updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccination. All persons aged \u22656 months should receive updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine.",

The LOINC Document Ontology (DO) is a subset of LOINC that is created specifically for naming and describing clinical documents. Despite the efforts of promoting and improving this ontology, how to efficiently deploy it in real-world clinical settings has yet to be explored. In this study we evaluated the utility of LOINC DO by mapping clinical note titles collected from five institutions to the LOINC DO and classifying the mapping into three classes based on semantic similarity between note t",

        "Abstract": "Complete and accurate race and ethnicity (RE) patient information is important for many areas of biomedical informatics research, such as defining and characterizing cohorts, performing quality assessments, and identifying health inequities. Patient-level RE data is often inaccurate or missing in structured sources, but can be supplemented through clinical notes and natural language processing (NLP). While NLP has made many improvements in recent years with large language models, bias remains an often-unaddressed concern, with research showing that harmful and negative language is more often used for certain racial/ethnic groups than others. We present an approach to audit the learned associations of models trained to identify RE information in clinical text by measuring the concordance between model-derived salient features and manually identified RE-related spans of text. We show that while models perform well on the surface, there exist concerning learned associations and potential for future harms from RE-identification models if left unaddressed.",

Using data across 9 states during Delta- and Omicron-predominant periods (June 2021-September 2022), we evaluated the effectiveness of the original monovalent COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccines among 521 206 emergency department/urgent care encounters (11 471 [2%] in patients with a documented disability) and 139 548 hospitalizations (16 569 [12%] in patients with a disability) for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness in adults (aged \u226518 years). Across variant periods and for the primary series or booster doses, vaccine effectiveness was similar in those with and those without a disability. These findings highlight the importance of adults with disabilities staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations.",

        "Abstract": "We carry out an analysis of gender differences in patterns of disease diagnosis across four large observational health datasets and find that women are routinely older when first assigned most diagnoses. Among 112 acute and chronic diseases, women experience longer lengths of time between symptom onset and disease diagnosis than men for most diseases regardless of metric used, even when only symptoms common to both genders are considered. These findings are consistent for patients with private as well as government insurance. Our analysis highlights systematic gender differences in patterns of disease diagnosis and suggests that symptoms of disease are measured or weighed differently for women and men. Data and code leverage the open-source common data model and analytic code and results are publicly available.",

        "Abstract": "On June 19, 2022, the original monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were approved as a primary series for children aged 6 months-4 years (Pfizer-BioNTech) and 6 months-5 years (Moderna) based on safety, immunobridging, and limited efficacy data from clinical trials. On December 9, 2022, CDC expanded recommendations for use of updated bivalent vaccines to children aged \u22656 months. mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against emergency department or urgent care (ED/UC) encounters was evaluated within the VISION Network during July 4, 2022-June 17, 2023, among children with COVID-19-like illness aged 6 months-5 years. Among children aged 6 months-5 years who received molecular SARS-CoV-2 testing during August 1, 2022-June 17, 2023, VE of 2 monovalent Moderna doses against ED/UC encounters was 29% (95% CI = 12%-42%) \u226514 days after dose 2 (median = 100 days after dose 2; IQR = 63-155 days). Among children aged 6 months-4 years with a COVID-19-like illness who received molecular testing during September 19, 2022-June 17, 2023, VE of 3 monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech doses was 43% (95% CI = 17%-61%) \u226514 days after dose 3 (median = 75 days after dose 3; IQR = 40-139 days). Effectiveness of \u22651 bivalent dose, comparing children with at least a complete primary series and \u22651 bivalent dose to unvaccinated children, irrespective of vaccine manufacturer, was 80% (95% CI = 42%-96%) among children aged 6 months-5 years a median of 58 days (IQR = 32-83 days) after the dose. All children should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including initiation of COVID-19 vaccination immediately when they are eligible.",

        "Abstract": "On September 1, 2022, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a single bivalent mRNA COVID-19 booster dose for persons aged \u226512 years who had completed at least a monovalent primary series. Early vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates among adults aged \u226518 years showed receipt of a bivalent booster dose provided additional protection against COVID-19-associated emergency department and urgent care visits and hospitalizations compared with that in persons who had received only monovalent vaccine doses (1); however, insufficient time had elapsed since bivalent vaccine authorization to assess the durability of this protection. The VISION Network* assessed VE against COVID-19-associated hospitalizations by time since bivalent vaccine receipt during September 13, 2022-April 21, 2023, among adults aged \u226518 years with and without immunocompromising conditions. During the first 7-59 days after vaccination, compared with no vaccination, VE for receipt of a bivalent vaccine dose among adults aged \u226518 years was 62% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a057%-67%) among adults without immunocompromising conditions and 28% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a010%-42%) among adults with immunocompromising conditions. Among adults without immunocompromising conditions, VE declined to 24% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a012%-33%) among those aged \u226518 years by 120-179 days after vaccination. VE was generally lower for adults with immunocompromising conditions. A bivalent booster dose provided the highest protection, and protection was sustained through at least 179 days against critical outcomes, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission or in-hospital death. These data support updated recommendations allowing additional optional bivalent COVID-19 vaccine doses for certain high-risk populations. All eligible persons should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines.",

        "Abstract": "With the burgeoning development of computational phenotypes, it is increasingly difficult to identify the right phenotype for the right tasks. This study uses a mixed-methods approach to develop and evaluate a novel metadata framework for retrieval of and reusing computational phenotypes. Twenty active phenotyping researchers from 2 large research networks, Electronic Medical Records and Genomics and Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, were recruited to suggest metadata elements. Once consensus was reached on 39 metadata elements, 47 new researchers were surveyed to evaluate the utility of the metadata framework. The survey consisted of 5-Likert multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions. Two more researchers were asked to use the metadata framework to annotate 8 type-2 diabetes mellitus phenotypes. More than 90% of the survey respondents rated metadata elements regarding phenotype definition and validation methods and metrics positively with a score of 4 or 5. Both researchers completed annotation of each phenotype within 60\u2009min. Our thematic analysis of the narrative feedback indicates that the metadata framework was effective in capturing rich and explicit descriptions and enabling the search for phenotypes, compliance with data standards, and comprehensive validation metrics. Current limitations were its complexity for data collection and the entailed human costs.",

The current study aims to assess the feasibility of creating an analysis package to link ADI rankings to multiple patient-level EHR datasets transformed into the OMOP CDM. Patients within two cancer cohorts (breast cancer and multiple myeloma) were identified within two OMOP datasets and their records were linked with ADI scores using address information in the OMOP location table. With ADI linked to patient addresses, we generated visualizations showing the geographic distribution of each cohort based on ADI scores. Additionally, further assessment showed that over 89% of patient addresses could successfully be linked with ADI rankings. In conducting this assessment, we have demonstrated that developing a package to link ADI scores with multiple OMOP datasets is feasible.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical documentation in electronic health records contains crucial narratives and details about patients and their care. Natural language processing (NLP) can unlock the information conveyed in clinical notes and reports, and thus plays a critical role in real-world studies. The NLP Working Group at the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) consortium was established to develop methods and tools to promote the use of textual data and NLP in real-world observational studies. In this paper, we describe a framework for representing and utilizing textual data in real-world evidence generation, including representations of information from clinical text in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), the workflow and tools that were developed to extract, transform and load (ETL) data from clinical notes into tables in OMOP CDM, as well as current applications and specific use cases of the proposed OHDSI NLP solution at large consortia and individual institutions with English textual data. Challenges faced and lessons learned during the process are also discussed to provide valuable insights for researchers who are planning to implement NLP solutions in real-world studies.",

        "Abstract": "During June-October 2022, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 sublineage accounted for most of the sequenced viral genomes in the United States, with further Omicron sublineage diversification through November 2022.* Bivalent mRNA vaccines contain an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain component plus an updated component of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 sublineages. On September 1, 2022, a single bivalent booster dose was recommended for adults who had completed a primary vaccination series (with or without subsequent booster doses), with the last dose administered \u22652 months earlier (1). During September 13-November 18, the VISION Network evaluated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a bivalent mRNA booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) compared with 1) no previous vaccination and 2) previous receipt of 2, 3, or 4 monovalent-only mRNA vaccine doses, among immunocompetent adults aged \u226518 years with an emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) encounter or hospitalization for a COVID-19-like illness.",

        "Abstract": "During June-October 2022, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 sublineage accounted for most of the sequenced viral genomes in the United States, with further Omicron sublineage diversification through November 2022.* Bivalent mRNA vaccines contain an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain component plus an updated component of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 sublineages. On September 1, 2022, a single bivalent booster dose was recommended for adults who had completed a primary vaccination series (with or without subsequent booster doses), with the last dose administered \u22652 months earlier (1). During September 13-November 18, the VISION Network evaluated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a bivalent mRNA booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) compared with 1) no previous vaccination and 2) previous receipt of 2, 3, or 4 monovalent-only mRNA vaccine doses, among immunocompetent adults aged \u226518 years with an emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) encounter or hospitalization for a COVID-19-like illness.",

        "Abstract": "Persons with moderate-to-severe immunocompromising conditions might have reduced protection after COVID-19 vaccination, compared with persons without immunocompromising conditions (1-3). On August 13, 2021, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that adults with immunocompromising conditions receive an expanded primary series of 3 doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. ACIP followed with recommendations on September 23, 2021, for a fourth (booster) dose and on September 1, 2022, for a new bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster dose, containing components of the BA.4 and BA.5 sublineages of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant (4). Data on vaccine effectiveness (VE) of monovalent COVID-19 vaccines among persons with immunocompromising conditions since the emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021 are limited.

Accurate and reliable identification of patients with DRE in observational data would enable large-scale, real-world comparative effectiveness research and improve access to specialized epilepsy care. In the present study, we aim to develop and compare the performance of computable phenotypes for DRE using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model.",

        "Abstract": "The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was first identified in the United States in November 2021, with the BA.1 sublineage (including BA.1.1) causing the largest surge in COVID-19 cases to date. Omicron sublineages BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 emerged later and by late April 2022, accounted for most cases.* Estimates of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) can be reduced by newly emerging variants or sublineages that evade vaccine-induced immunity (1), protection from previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated persons (2), or increasing time since vaccination (3). Real-world data comparing VE during the periods when the BA.1 and BA.2/BA.2.12.1 predominated (BA.1 period and BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period, respectively) are limited. The VISION network",

        "Abstract": "The All of Us (AoU) Research Program aggregates electronic health records (EHR) data from 300,00+ participants spanning 50+ distinct data sites. The diversity and size of AoU's data network result in multifaceted obstacles to data integration that may undermine the usability of patient EHR. Consequently, the AoU team implemented data quality tools to regularly evaluate and communicate EHR data quality issues at scale. The use of systematic feedback and educational tools ultimately increased site engagement and led to quantitative improvements in EHR quality as measured by program- and externally-defined metrics. These improvements enabled the AoU team to save time on troubleshooting EHR and focus on the development of alternate mechanisms to improve the quality of future EHR submissions. While this framework has proven effective, further efforts to automate and centralize communication channels are needed to deepen the program's efforts while retaining its scalability.",

We developed five methods that used a combination of automated, semi-automated and manual approaches for generating measurement concept sets. We validated our concept sets by calculating their frequencies in cohorts from the Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) database. For heart transplant patients, the preoperative frequencies of basic metabolic panel concept sets, which we generated by a semi-automated approach, were greater than 99%. We also made concept sets for lumbar puncture and coagulation panels, by automated and manual methods respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Efforts to characterize variability in epilepsy treatment pathways are limited by the large number of possible antiseizure medication (ASM) regimens and sequences, heterogeneity of patients, and challenges of measuring confounding variables and outcomes across institutions. The Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) collaborative is an international data network representing over 1 billion patient records using common data standards. However, few studies have applied OHDSI's Common Data Model (CDM) to the population with epilepsy and none have validated relevant concepts. The goals of this study were to demonstrate the feasibility of characterizing adult patients with epilepsy and ASM treatment pathways using the CDM in an electronic health record (EHR)-derived database.",

        "Abstract": "The efficacy of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 exceeded 90% in clinical trials that included children and adolescents aged 5-11, 12-15, and 16-17 years (1-3). Limited real-world data on 2-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) in persons aged 12-17 years (referred to as adolescents in this report) have also indicated high levels of protection against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) infection and COVID-19-associated hospitalization (4-6); however, data on VE against the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant and duration of protection are limited. Pfizer-BioNTech VE data are not available for children aged 5-11 years. In partnership with CDC, the VISION Network* examined 39,217 emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters and 1,699 hospitalizations",

        "Abstract": "Estimates of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) have declined in recent months (1,2) because of waning vaccine induced immunity over time,* possible increased immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 variants (3), or a combination of these and other factors. CDC recommends that all persons aged \u226512 years receive a third dose (booster) of an mRNA vaccine \u22655 months after receipt of the second mRNA vaccine dose and that immunocompromised individuals receive a third primary dose.",

        "Abstract": "Previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) or COVID-19 vaccination can provide immunity and protection from subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness. CDC used data from the VISION Network* to examine hospitalizations in adults with COVID-19-like illness and compared the odds of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and thus having laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, between unvaccinated patients with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection occurring 90-179 days before COVID-19-like illness hospitalization, and patients who were fully vaccinated with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine 90-179 days before hospitalization with no previous documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hospitalized adults aged \u226518 years with COVID-19-like illness were included if they had received testing at least twice: once associated with a COVID-19-like illness hospitalization during January-September 2021 and at least once earlier (since February 1, 2020, and \u226514 days before that hospitalization). Among COVID-19-like illness hospitalizations in persons whose previous infection or vaccination occurred 90-179 days earlier, the odds of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (adjusted for sociodemographic and health characteristics) among unvaccinated, previously infected adults were higher than the odds among fully vaccinated recipients of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine with no previous documented infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]\u00a0=\u00a05.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a02.75-10.99). These findings suggest that among hospitalized adults with COVID-19-like illness whose previous infection or vaccination occurred 90-179 days earlier, vaccine-induced immunity was more protective than infection-induced immunity against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. All eligible persons should be vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as possible, including unvaccinated persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.",

        "Abstract": "Data on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) since the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, became the predominant circulating strain in the United States are limited (1-3). CDC used the VISION Network* to examine medical encounters (32,867) from 187 hospitals and 221 emergency departments (EDs) and urgent care (UC) clinics across nine states during June-August 2021, beginning on the date the Delta variant accounted for >50% of sequenced isolates in each medical facility's state. VISION Network methods have been published (4).",

        "Abstract": "The recognition, disambiguation, and expansion of medical abbreviations and acronyms is of upmost importance to prevent medically-dangerous misinterpretation in natural language processing. To support recognition, disambiguation, and expansion, we present the Medical Abbreviation and Acronym Meta-Inventory, a deep database of medical abbreviations. A systematic harmonization of eight source inventories across multiple healthcare specialties and settings identified 104,057 abbreviations with 170,426 corresponding senses. Automated cross-mapping of synonymous records using state-of-the-art machine learning reduced redundancy, which simplifies future application. Additional features include semi-automated quality control to remove errors. The Meta-Inventory demonstrated high completeness or coverage of abbreviations and senses in new clinical text, a substantial improvement over the next largest repository (6-14% increase in abbreviation coverage; 28-52% increase in sense coverage). To our knowledge, the Meta-Inventory is the most complete compilation of medical abbreviations and acronyms in American English to-date. The multiple sources and high coverage support application in varied specialties and settings. This allows for cross-institutional natural language processing, which previous inventories did not support. The Meta-Inventory is available at https://bit.ly/github-clinical-abbreviations .",

        "Abstract": "Unfavourable procurement biopsy findings are the most common reason for deceased donor kidney discard in the United States. We sought to assess the association between biopsy findings and post-transplant outcomes when donor characteristics are accounted for. We used registry data to identify 1566 deceased donors of 3132 transplanted kidneys (2015-2020) with discordant right/left procurement biopsy classification and performed time-to-event analyses to determine the association between optimal histology and hazard of death-censored graft failure or death. We then repeated all analyses using a local cohort of 147 donors of kidney pairs with detailed procurement histology data available (2006-2016). Among transplanted kidney pairs in the national cohort, there were no significant differences in incidence of delayed graft function or primary nonfunction. Time to death-censored graft failure was not significantly different between recipients of optimal versus suboptimal kidneys. Results were similar in analyses using the local cohort. Regarding recipient survival, analysis of the national, but not local, cohort showed optimal kidneys were associated with a lower hazard of death (adjusted HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.90, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006). In conclusion, in a large national cohort of deceased donor kidney pairs with discordant right/left procurement biopsy findings, we found no association between histology and death-censored graft survival.",

The LOINC Document Ontology (DO) is a universal clinical document standard in a hierarchical structure. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility and generalizability of LOINC DO by mapping from clinical note titles across five institutions to five DO axes. We first developed an annotation framework based on the definition of LOINC DO axes and manually mapped 4,000 titles. Then we introduced a pre-trained deep learning model named Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to enable automatic mapping from titles to LOINC DO axes. The results showed that the BERT-based automatic mapping achieved improved performance compared with the baseline model. By analyzing both manual annotations and predicted results, ambiguities in LOINC DO axes definition were discussed.",

Manually devel- oped phenotyping algorithms, such as those curated within the eMERGE (electronic Medical Records and Genomics) Network, represent the gold standard but are time consuming to create. In this work, we propose a framework for learning from the structure of eMERGE phenotype concept sets to assist construction of novel phenotype definitions. We use eMERGE phenotypes as a source of reference concept sets and engineer rich features characterizing the con- cept pairs within each set. We treat these pairwise relationships as edges in a concept graph, train models to perform edge prediction, and identify candidate phenotype concept sets as highly connected subgraphs. Candidate concept sets may then be interrogated and composed to construct novel phenotype definitions.",

This leads to different granularity or detail of concepts representing the clinical facts. For researchers studying certain populations of interest, it is important to ensure that concepts at the right level are used for the definition of these populations. We studied the granularity of concepts within 22 data sources in the OHDSI network and calculated a composite granularity score for each dataset. Three alternative SNOMED-based approaches for such score showed consistency in classifying data sources into three levels of granularity (low, moderate and high), which correlated with the provenance of data and country of origin. However, they performed unsatisfactorily in ordering data sources within these groups and showed inconsistency for small data sources. Further studies on examining approaches to data source granularity are needed.",

        "Abstract": "Early identification of symptoms and comorbidities most predictive of COVID-19 is critical to identify infection, guide policies to effectively contain the pandemic, and improve health systems' response. Here, we characterised socio-demographics and comorbidity in 3,316,107persons tested and 219,072 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 since January 2020, and their key health outcomes in the month following the first positive test. Routine care data from primary care electronic health records (EHR) from Spain, hospital EHR from the United States (US), and claims data from South Korea and the US were used. The majority of study participants were women aged 18-65 years old. Positive/tested ratio varied greatly geographically (2.2:100 to 31.2:100) and over time (from 50:100 in February-April to 6.8:100 in May-June). Fever, cough and dyspnoea were the most common symptoms at presentation. Between 4%-38% required admission and 1-10.5% died within a month from their first positive test. Observed disparity in testing practices led to variable baseline characteristics and outcomes, both nationally (US) and internationally. Our findings highlight the importance of large scale characterization of COVID-19 international cohorts to inform planning and resource allocation including testing as countries face a second wave.",

The current practice is to analyze the outcomes based on patient level data submitted to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). Augmenting the UNOS data with other sources such as the electronic health record will enrich the outcomes analysis, for which a common data model (CDM) can be a helpful tool for transforming heterogeneous source data into a uniform format.",

        "Abstract": "Comorbid conditions appear to be common among individuals hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but estimates of prevalence vary and little is known about the prior medication use of patients. Here, we describe the characteristics of adults hospitalised with COVID-19 and compare them with influenza patients. We include 34,128 (US: 8362, South Korea: 7341, Spain: 18,425) COVID-19 patients, summarising between 4811 and 11,643 unique aggregate characteristics. COVID-19 patients have been majority male in the US and Spain, but predominantly female in South Korea. Age profiles vary across data sources. Compared to 84,585 individuals hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19, COVID-19 patients have more typically been male, younger, and with fewer comorbidities and lower medication use. While protecting groups vulnerable to influenza is likely a useful starting point in the response to COVID-19, strategies will likely need to be broadened to reflect the particular characteristics of individuals being hospitalised with COVID-19.",

Though organizational clinical data are abundant, these are largely inaccessible to outside researchers. Statistical, machine learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale data beyond what is available in any given organization. Here, we introduce the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science community focused on analyzing patient-level data from many centers.",

In this study, we addressed the challenge of automating the normalization of COVID-19 diagnostic tests, which are critical data elements, but for which controlled terminology terms were published after clinical implementation. We developed a simple but effective rule-based tool called COVID-19 TestNorm to automatically normalize local COVID-19 testing names to standard LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) codes. COVID-19 TestNorm was developed and evaluated using 568 test names collected from 8 healthcare systems. Our results show that it could achieve an accuracy of 97.4% on an independent test set. COVID-19 TestNorm is available as an open-source package for developers and as an online Web application for end users (https://clamp.uth.edu/covid/loinc.php). We believe that it will be a useful tool to support secondary use of EHRs for research on COVID-19.",

        "Title": "Deep phenotyping of 34,128 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and a comparison with 81,596 influenza patients in America, Europe and Asia: an international network study.",
        "Abstract": "Background In this study we phenotyped individuals hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in depth, summarising entire medical histories, including medications, as captured in routinely collected data drawn from databases across three continents. We then compared individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 to those previously hospitalised with influenza. Methods We report demographics, previously recorded conditions and medication use of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the US (Columbia University Irving Medical Center [CUIMC], Premier Healthcare Database [PHD], UCHealth System Health Data Compass Database [UC HDC], and the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA OMOP]), in South Korea (Health Insurance Review & Assessment [HIRA]), and Spain (The Information System for Research in Primary Care [SIDIAP] and HM Hospitales [HM]). These patients were then compared with patients hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19. Results 34,128 (US: 8,362, South Korea: 7,341, Spain: 18,425) individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 were included. Between 4,811 (HM) and 11,643 (CUIMC) unique aggregate characteristics were extracted per patient, with all summarised in an accompanying interactive website (http://evidence.ohdsi.org/Covid19CharacterizationHospitalization/). Patients were majority male in the US (CUIMC: 52%, PHD: 52%, UC HDC: 54%, VA OMOP: 94%,) and Spain (SIDIAP: 54%, HM: 60%), but were predominantly female in South Korea (HIRA: 60%). Age profiles varied across data sources. Prevalence of asthma ranged from 4% to 15%, diabetes from 13% to 43%, and hypertensive disorder from 24% to 70% across data sources. Between 14% and 33% were taking drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system in the 30 days prior to hospitalisation. Compared to 81,596 individuals hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19, patients admitted with COVID-19 were more typically male, younger, and healthier, with fewer comorbidities and lower medication use. Conclusions We provide a detailed characterisation of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Protecting groups known to be vulnerable to influenza is a useful starting point to minimize the number of hospital admissions needed for COVID-19. However, such strategies will also likely need to be broadened so as to reflect the particular characteristics of individuals hospitalised with COVID-19.",

While treatment guidelines and care variations for these comorbidities have been described for the general noncancer population, less is known about real-world treatment patterns in patients with cancer.

        "Abstract": "Knowledge gained from observational cohort studies has dramatically advanced the prevention and treatment of diseases. Many of these cohorts, however, are small, lack diversity, or do not provide comprehensive phenotype data. The All of Us Research Program plans to enroll a diverse group of at least 1 million persons in the United States in order to accelerate biomedical research and improve health. The program aims to make the research results accessible to participants, and it is developing new approaches to generate, access, and make data broadly available to approved researchers. All of Us opened for enrollment in May 2018 and currently enrolls participants 18 years of age or older from a network of more than 340 recruitment sites. Elements of the program protocol include health questionnaires, electronic health records (EHRs), physical measurements, the use of digital health technology, and the collection and analysis of biospecimens. As of July 2019, more than 175,000 participants had contributed biospecimens. More than 80% of these participants are from groups that have been historically underrepresented in biomedical research. EHR data on more than 112,000 participants from 34 sites have been collected. The All of Us data repository should permit researchers to take into account individual differences in lifestyle, socioeconomic factors, environment, and biologic characteristics in order to advance precision diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.",

        "Abstract": "The volume of solid organ transplant in the United States is increasing, providing improved quality of life and survival for patients with organ failure. The growth of transplant requires a systematized management of transplant outcomes assessment, especially with the movement toward value-based care. However, there are several challenges to analyzing outcomes in the current registry-based, transplant reporting system: (1) longitudinal data points are difficult to capture in outcomes models; (2)\u00a0data elements are restricted to those that already exist in the registry data; and (3)\u00a0there is a delay in the release of outcomes report. In this article, we propose an informatics approach to solve these problems by using a \"common data model\" to integrate disparate data sources, data elements, and temporal data points. Adopting such a framework can enable multicenter outcomes analyses among transplant centers, nationally and internationally.",

The system, known as EzVac, has been operational since 1998 and now includes information on 2 million immunizations administered to more than 260,000 individuals. The system exchanges data with multiple electronic health records, a public health immunization registry, and a standalone personal health record. EzVac modules have recently been incorporated into the OpenMRS application and are being used to enhance immunization efforts in developing nations. We report on our experience with developing and using the EzVac system for 1) clinical care, both in local and global settings, 2) public health reporting, 3) consumer engagement, and 4) clinical and informatics research. We emphasize the advantages of using health IT standards to facilitate immunization information exchange in each of these domains.",

        "Abstract": "Despite being at highest risk for 2009 H1N1 virus morbidity and mortality, many children were not immunized with the vaccine. Identification of factors that put certain children at higher risk for under-immunization could reveal populations who may need to be specifically targeted for vaccination interventions in future pandemics. Little is known about the prevalence of, or factors associated with, 2009 H1N1 vaccine coverage in low-income, urban pediatric populations. This study evaluated 2009 H1N1 vaccination coverage in 19,643 children aged 6months to 18years receiving care at one of five community clinics associated with an academic medical center in a low-income community. Any (\u22651 dose) and full coverage (1 dose for children \u226510years old, 2 doses for those <10years) was determined as of December 1, 2009 and the end of vaccination period (June 30, 2010). Multivariable analyses were used to assess the impact of race/ethnicity, age, insurance, gender, and language on vaccine coverage and timeliness. By December 1, only 16.6% of children had received one dose, and 5.3% had full coverage. By the end of the vaccination period, 36.2% had received at least one H1N1 dose and 23.6% had full coverage. On multivariable analysis, older age, minority race/ethnicity, and private insurance were negatively associated with vaccination by December 1 and end of vaccination period, even after accounting for attendance at a clinic visit. In future pandemics, when timely receipt of a new vaccine in large populations may be imperative, general vaccination programs as well as special targeted education and vaccine reminders for these at risk groups may be warranted.",

Adapting EHR systems to serve public health needs provides the possibility of enormous advances for public health practice and policy. In this review, we evaluate EHR functionality and map it to the three core functions of public health: assessment, policy development, and assurance. In doing so, we identify and discuss important design, implementation, and methodological issues with current systems. For example, in order to support public health's traditional focus on preventive health and socio-behavioral factors, EHR data models would need to be expanded to incorporate environmental, psychosocial, and other non-medical data elements, and workflow would have to be examined to determine the optimal way of collecting these data. We also argue that redesigning EHR systems to support public health offers benefits not only to the public health system but also to consumers, health-care institutions, and individual providers.",
