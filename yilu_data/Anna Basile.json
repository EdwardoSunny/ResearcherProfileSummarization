        "Abstract": "The mechanisms underlying the selective regional vulnerability to neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD) have not been fully defined. To explore the role of astrocytes in this phenomenon, we used single-nucleus and bulk RNAseq, lipidomics, HTT gene CAG repeat-length measurements, and multiplexed immunofluorescence on HD and control post-mortem brains. We identified genes that correlated with CAG repeat length, which were enriched in astrocyte genes, and lipidomic signatures that implicated poly-unsaturated fatty acids in sensitizing neurons to cell death. Because astrocytes play essential roles in lipid metabolism, we explored the heterogeneity of astrocytic states in both protoplasmic and fibrous-like (CD44+) astrocytes. Significantly, one protoplasmic astrocyte state showed high levels of metallothioneins and was correlated with the selective vulnerability of distinct striatal neuronal populations. When modeled in vitro, this state improved the viability of HD-patient-derived spiny projection neurons. Our findings uncover key roles of astrocytic states in protecting against neurodegeneration in HD.",

        "Abstract": "Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) gene variations are linked to the development of numerous cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The lack of typical drug-binding sites has long hampered the discovery of therapeutic drugs targeting KRAS. Since \"CodeBreaK 100\" demonstrated Sotorasib's early safety and efficacy and led to its approval, especially in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the subsequent identification of specific inhibitors for the p.G12C mutation has offered hope. However, the CodeBreaK 200 study found no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between patients treated with Docetaxel and Sotorasib (AMG 510), adding another degree of complexity to this ongoing challenge. The current study compares the three-dimensional structures of the two major KRAS isoforms, KRAS4A and KRAS4B. It also investigates the probable structural changes caused by the three major mutations (p.G12C, p.G12D, and p.G12V) within Sotorasib's pocket domain. The computational analysis demonstrates that the wild-type and mutant isoforms have distinct aggregation propensities, resulting in the creation of alternate oligomeric configurations. This study highlights the increased complexity of the biological issue of using KRAS as a therapeutic target. The present study stresses the need for a better understanding of the structural dynamics of KRAS and its mutations to design more effective therapeutic approaches. It also emphasizes the potential of computational approaches to shed light on the complicated molecular pathways that drive KRAS-mediated oncogenesis. This study adds to the ongoing efforts to address the therapeutic hurdles presented by KRAS in cancer treatment.",

        "Abstract": "BAG3 (Bcl2-associated athanogene3) is able to induce the transformation of cancer-associated fibroblasts to alpha smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) positive (+) myofibroblasts. In systemic sclerosis (SSc), a-SMA+ myofibroblasts also play an important role in the progression of fibrosis in the skin and involved internal organs. The aim of the study was to investigate whether BAG3 is overexpressed in SSc and may be a biomarker of fibrogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Less than half of individuals with a suspected Mendelian condition receive a precise molecular diagnosis after comprehensive clinical genetic testing. Improvements in data quality and costs have heightened interest in using long-read sequencing (LRS) to streamline clinical genomic testing, but the absence of control datasets for variant filtering and prioritization has made tertiary analysis of LRS data challenging. To address this, the 1000 Genomes Project ONT Sequencing Consortium aims to generate LRS data from at least 800 of the 1000 Genomes Project samples. Our goal is to use LRS to identify a broader spectrum of variation so we may improve our understanding of normal patterns of human variation. Here, we present data from analysis of the first 100 samples, representing all 5 superpopulations and 19 subpopulations. These samples, sequenced to an average depth of coverage of 37x and sequence read N50 of 54 kbp, have high concordance with previous studies for identifying single nucleotide and indel variants outside of homopolymer regions. Using multiple structural variant (SV) callers, we identify an average of 24,543 high-confidence SVs per genome, including shared and private SVs likely to disrupt gene function as well as pathogenic expansions within disease-associated repeats that were not detected using short reads. Evaluation of methylation signatures revealed expected patterns at known imprinted loci, samples with skewed X-inactivation patterns, and novel differentially methylated regions. All raw sequencing data, processed data, and summary statistics are publicly available, providing a valuable resource for the clinical genetics community to discover pathogenic SVs.",

The unsatisfactory results of treatments targeting cell proliferation and its related mechanisms suggest a shift in focus towards the inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we discuss the role of cancer-secreted proteins in the complex TME tumor-stroma crosstalk, shedding lights on druggable molecular targets for the development of innovative, safer and more efficient therapeutic strategies.",

A group of first-time stroke patients (n\u00a0=\u00a074) underwent an acute behavioral assessment comprising the OCS and the NIHSS within one-week post-stroke. Functional outcome was evaluated using the Stroke Impact Scale 3.0 (SIS 3.0) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) at 6 and 12-months post-stroke. We compared the predictive ability of the OCS and NIHSS, separately or in combination, to predict different domains of behavioral impairment at a chronic evaluation. The OCS accounted for 61% of variance of SIS physical domain, 61% of memory domain, 79% of language domain, 70% of participation domain and 70% of recovery domain. The OCS accounted for a greater percentage of outcome variance than demographics and NIHSS. The most informative predictive model included the combination of demographics, OCS and NIHSS data. The OCS, performed early after stroke, is a strong independent predictor of long-term functional outcome and significantly improves the prediction of outcome when considered alongside the NIHSS and demographics.",

        "Abstract": "The early steps of viral infection involve protein complexes and structural lipid rearrangements which characterize the peculiar strategies of each virus to invade permissive host cells. Members of the human immune-related interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family have been described as inhibitors of the entry of a broad range of viruses into the host cells. Recently, it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 is able to hijack IFITM2 for efficient infection. Here, we report the characterization of a newly generated specific anti-IFITM2 mAb able to impair Spike-mediated internalization of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells and, consequently, to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effects and syncytia formation. Furthermore, the anti-IFITM2 mAb reduced HSVs- and RSV-dependent cytopathic effects, suggesting that the IFITM2-mediated mechanism of host cell invasion might be shared with other viruses besides SARS-CoV-2. These results show the specific role of IFITM2 in mediating viral entry into the host cell and its candidacy as a cell target for antiviral therapeutic strategies.",

The final, phase 3 release of the 1kGP included 2,504 unrelated samples from 26 populations and was based primarily on low-coverage WGS. Here, we present a high-coverage 3,202-sample WGS 1kGP resource, which now includes 602 complete trios, sequenced to a depth of 30X using Illumina. We performed single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and short insertion and deletion (INDEL) discovery and generated a comprehensive set of structural variants (SVs) by integrating multiple analytic methods through a machine learning model. We show gains in sensitivity and precision of variant calls compared to phase 3, especially among rare SNVs as well as INDELs and SVs spanning frequency spectrum. We also generated an improved reference imputation panel, making variants discovered here accessible for association studies.",

        "Abstract": "The BAG3- and SIRP\u03b1- mediated pathways trigger distinct cellular targets and signaling mechanisms in pancreatic cancer microenvironment. To explore their functional connection, we investigated the effects of their combined blockade on cancer growth in orthotopic allografts of pancreatic cancer mt4-2D cells in immunocompetent mice. The anti-BAG3\u2009+\u2009anti-SIRP\u03b1 mAbs treatment inhibited (p\u2009=\u20090.007) tumor growth by about the 70%; also the number of metastatic lesions was decreased, mostly by the effect of the anti-BAG3 mAb. Fibrosis and the expression of the CAF activation marker \u03b1-SMA were reduced by about the 30% in animals treated with anti-BAG3 mAb compared to untreated animals, and appeared unaffected by treatment with the anti-SIRP\u03b1 mAb alone; however, the addition of anti-SIRP\u03b1 to anti-BAG3 mAb in the combined treatment resulted in a\u2009>\u200960% (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) reduction of the fibrotic area and a\u200970% (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) inhibition of CAF \u03b1-SMA positivity. Dendritic cells (DCs) and CD8+\u2009lymphocytes, hardly detectable in the tumors of untreated animals, were modestly increased by single treatments, while were much more clearly observable (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) in the tumors of the animals subjected to the combined treatment. The effects of BAG3 and SIRP\u03b1 blockade do not simply reflect the sum of the effects of the single blockades, indicating that the two pathways are connected by regulatory interactions and suggesting, as a proof of principle, the potential therapeutic efficacy of a combined BAG3 and SIRP\u03b1 blockade in pancreatic cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Hypoxia and angiogenesis in solid tumors are often strictly linked to the development of fibrotic tissues, a detrimental event that compromises the antitumor immunity. As a consequence, tumor aggressiveness and poor patient prognosis relate to higher incidence of tissue fibrosis and stromal stiffness. The molecular pathways through which normal fibroblasts are converted in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have a central role in the onset of fibrosis in tumor stroma, thus emerging as a strategic target of novel therapeutic approaches for cancer disease. Several studies addressed the role of BAG3 in sustaining growth and survival of cancer cell and also shed light on the different mechanisms in which the intracellular protein is involved. More recently, new pieces of evidence revealed a pivotal role of extracellular BAG3 in pro-tumor cell signaling in the tumor microenvironment, as well as its involvement in the development of fibrosis in tumor tissues. Here we report further data showing the presence of the BAG3 receptor (Interferon-induced transmembrane protein [IFITM]-2) on the plasma membrane of normal dermal fibroblasts and the activity of BAG3 as a factor able to induce the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and the phosphorylation of AKT and focal adhesion kinase, that sustain CAF functions in tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, in agreement with these findings, bag3 gene expression has been analyzed by high throughput RNA sequencing databases from patients-derived xenografts. A strong correlation between bag3 gene expression and patients' survival was found in several types of fibrotic tumors. The results obtained provide encouraging data that identify BAG3 as a promising therapeutic target to counteract fibrosis in tumors.",

        "Abstract": "Patients affected with gliomas develop a complex set of clinical manifestations that deeply impact on quality of life and overall survival. Brain tumor-related epilepsy is frequently the first manifestation of gliomas or may occur during the course of disease; the underlying mechanisms have not been fully explained and depend on both patient and tumor factors. Novel treatment options derive from the growing use of third-generation antiepileptic drugs. Vasogenic edema and elevated intracranial pressure cause a considerable burden of symptoms, especially in high-grade glioma, requiring an adequate use of corticosteroids. Patients with gliomas present with an elevated risk of tumor-associated venous thromboembolism whose prophylaxis and treatment are challenging, considering also the availability of new oral anticoagulant drugs. Moreover, intracerebral hemorrhages can complicate the course of the illness both due to tumor-specific characteristics, patient comorbidities, and side effects of antithrombotic and antitumoral therapies. This paper aims to review recent advances in these clinical issues, discussing the medical management of gliomas through an updated literature review.",

        "Abstract": "Long-read and strand-specific sequencing technologies together facilitate the de novo assembly of high-quality haplotype-resolved human genomes without parent-child trio data. We present 64 assembled haplotypes from 32 diverse human genomes. These highly contiguous haplotype assemblies (average minimum contig length needed to cover 50% of the genome: 26 million base pairs) integrate all forms of genetic variation, even across complex loci. We identified 107,590 structural variants (SVs), of which 68% were not discovered with short-read sequencing, and 278 SV hotspots (spanning megabases of gene-rich sequence). We characterized 130 of the most active mobile element source elements and found that 63% of all SVs arise through homology-mediated mechanisms. This resource enables reliable graph-based genotyping from short reads of up to 50,340 SVs, resulting in the identification of 1526 expression quantitative trait loci as well as SV candidates for adaptive selection within the human population.",

        "Title": "Acute revascularization treatments for ischemic stroke in the Stroke Units of Triveneto, northeast Italy: time to treatment and functional outcomes.",
        "Abstract": "It is not known whether the current territorial organization for acute revascularization treatments in ischemic stroke patients guarantees similar time to treatment and functional outcomes among different levels of institutional stroke care. We aimed to assess the impact of time to treatment on functional outcomes in ischemic stroke patients who received intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) alone, bridging (IVT plus thrombectomy), or primary thrombectomy in level 1 and level 2 Stroke Units (SUs) in Triveneto, a geographical macroarea in Northeast of Italy. We conducted an analysis of data prospectively collected from 512 consecutive ischemic stroke patients who received IVT and/or mechanical thrombectomy in 25 SUs from September 17th to December 9th 2018. The favorable outcome measures were mRS score 0-1 and 0-2 at 3\u00a0months. The unfavorable outcome measures were mRS score 3-5 and death at 3\u00a0months. We estimated separately the possible association of each variable for time to treatment (onset-to-door, door-to-needle, onset-to-needle, door-to-groin puncture, needle-to-groin puncture, and onset-to-groin puncture) with 3-month outcome measures by calculating the odds ratios (ORs) with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) after adjustment for pre-defined variables and variables with a probability value\u2009\u2264\u20090.10 in the univariate analysis for each outcome measure. Distribution of acute revascularization treatments was different between level 1 and level 2 SUs (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Among 182 patients admitted to level 1 SUs (n\u2009=\u200916), treatments were IVT alone in 164 (90.1%), bridging in 12 (6.6%), and primary thrombectomy in 6 (3.3%) patients. Among 330 patients admitted to level 2 SUs (n\u2009=\u20099), treatments were IVT alone in 219 (66.4%), bridging in 74 (22.4%), and primary thrombectomy in 37 (11.2%) patients. Rates of excellent outcome (51.4% vs 45.9%), favorable outcome (60.1% vs 58.7%), unfavorable outcome (33.3% vs 33.8%), and death (9.8% vs 11.3%) at 3\u00a0months were similar between level 1 and 2 SUs. No significant association was found between time to IVT alone (onset-to-door, door-to-needle, and onset-to-needle) and functional outcomes. After adjustment, door-to-needle time\u2009\u2264\u200960\u00a0min (OR 4.005, 95% CI 1.232-13.016), shorter door-to-groin time (OR 0.991, 95% CI 0.983-0.999), shorter needle-to-groin time (OR 0.986, 95% CI 0.975-0.997), and shorter onset-to-groin time (OR 0.994, 95% CI 0.988-1.000) were associated with mRS 0-1. Shorter door-to-groin time (OR 0.991, 95% CI 0.984-0.998), door-to-groin time\u2009\u2264\u200990\u00a0min (OR 12.146, 95% CI 2.193-67.280), shorter needle-to-groin time (OR 0.983, 95% CI 0.972-0.995), and shorter onset-to-groin time (OR 0.993, 95% CI 0.987-0.999) were associated with mRS 0-2. Longer door-to-groin time (OR 1.007, 95% CI 1.001-1.014) and longer needle-to-groin time (OR 1.019, 95% CI 1.005-1.034) were associated with mRS 3-5, while door-to-groin time\u2009\u2264\u200990\u00a0min (OR 0.229, 95% CI 0.065-0.808) was inversely associated with mRS 3-5. Longer onset-to-needle time (OR 1.025, 95% CI 1.002-1.048) was associated with death. Times to treatment influenced the 3-month outcomes in patients treated with thrombectomy (bridging or primary). A revision of the current territorial organization for acute stroke treatments in Triveneto is needed to reduce transfer time and to increase the proportion of patients transferred from a level 1 SU to a level 2 SU to perform thrombectomy.",

Promising treatment options derive from the development of novel anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), like Eslicarbazepine (ESL), whose role in BTRE has not yet been explored. Our aim was to report a retrospective cohort of patients affected by BTRE treated with ESL as an adjunctive therapy and to discuss the potential role of this third-generation AED in this clinical context.",

Pharmacovigilance is the field of science that monitors, detects, and prevents adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Safety efforts begin during the development process, using in vivo and in vitro studies, continue through clinical trials, and extend to postmarketing surveillance of ADRs in real-world populations. Future toxicity and safety challenges, including increased polypharmacy and patient diversity, stress the limits of these traditional tools. Massive amounts of newly available data present an opportunity for using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to improve drug safety science. Here, we explore recent advances as applied to preclinical drug safety and postmarketing surveillance with a specific focus on machine and deep learning (DL) approaches.",

Here, we used complementarity-determining region (CDR) grafting to generate a humanized version of the anti-BAG3 antibody that may be further developed for possible clinical use. We show that the humanized anti-BAG3 antibody, named BAG3-H2L4, abrogates BAG3 binding to macrophages and subsequent release of IL-6. Furthermore, it specifically localizes into tumor tissues and significantly inhibits the growth of Mia PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cell xenografts. We propose BAG3-H2L4 antibody as a potential clinical candidate for BAG3-targeted therapy in pancreatic cancer.",

        "Abstract": "The development of sequencing techniques and statistical methods provides great opportunities for identifying the impact of rare genetic variation on complex traits. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the impact of sample size, case numbers, the balance of cases vs controls for both burden and dispersion based rare variant association methods. For example, Phenome-Wide Association Studies may have a wide range of case and control sample sizes across hundreds of diagnoses and traits, and with the application of statistical methods to rare variants, it is important to understand the strengths and limitations of the analyses.",

        "Abstract": "Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is the treatment of choice for most patients with acute ischemic stroke. According to the recently updated guidelines, IVT should be administered in absence of absolute exclusion criteria. We aimed to assess the proportion of ischemic strokes potentially eligible and actually treated with IVT, and to explore the reasons for not administering IVT. We prospectively collected and analyzed data from 1184 consecutive ischemic stroke patients admitted to the 22 Stroke Units (SUs) of the Veneto region from September 18th to December 10th 2017. Patients were treated with IVT according to the current Italian guidelines. For untreated patients, the reasons for not administering IVT were reported by each center in a predefined model including absolute and/or relative exclusion criteria and other possible reasons. Out of 841 (71%) patients who presented within 4.5\u00a0h of stroke onset, 704 (59%) had no other absolute exclusion criteria and were therefore potentially eligible for IVT according to the current guidelines. However, only 323 (27%) patients were eventually treated with IVT. Among 861 (73%) untreated patients, 480 had at least one absolute exclusion criterion, 283 only relative exclusion criteria, 56 only other reasons, and 42 a combination of relative exclusion criteria and other reasons. Our study showed that only 46% (323/704) of the potentially eligible patients were actually treated with IVT in the SUs of the Veneto region. All healthcare professionals involved in the acute stroke pathway should make an effort to bridge this gap between eligibility and reality.",

        "Abstract": "Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a cruciferous vegetable-derived compound, is a versatile cancer chemopreventive agent that displays the ability to inhibit tumor growth during initiation, promotion, and progression phases in several animal models of carcinogenesis. In this report, we dissect the cellular events induced by noncytotoxic concentrations of PEITC in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In the early phase, PEITC treatment elicited cells' morphological changes that comprise reduction in cell volume and modification of actin organization concomitantly with a rapid activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Downstream to PI3K, PEITC also induces the activity of Rac1 and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), well-known regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Interestingly, PEITC modifications of the actin cytoskeleton were abrogated by pretreatment with JNK inhibitor, SP600125. JNK signaling led also to the activation of the c-Jun transcription factor, which is involved in the upregulation of several genes; among them is the BAG3 protein. This protein, a member of the BAG family of heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 cochaperones, is able to sustain survival in different tumor cell lines and neoangiogenesis by directly regulating the endothelial cell cycle. Furthermore, BAG3 is involved in maintaining actin folding. Our findings indicate that BAG3 protein expression is induced in endothelial cells upon exposure to a noncytotoxic concentration of PEITC and its expression is requested for the recovery of normal cell size and morphology after the stressful stimuli. This assigns an additional role for BAG3 protein in the endothelial cells after a stress event.",

        "Abstract": "For the past decade, the focus of complex disease research has been the genotype. From technological advancements to the development of analysis methods, great progress has been made. However, advances in our definition of the phenotype have remained stagnant. Phenotype characterization has recently emerged as an exciting area of informatics and machine learning. The copious amounts of diverse biomedical data that have been collected may be leveraged with data-driven approaches to elucidate trait-related features and patterns. Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss the phenotype in traditional genetic associations and the challenges this has imposed.Approaches for phenotype refinement that can aid in more accurate characterization of traits are also discussed. Further, the authors highlight promising machine learning approaches for establishing a phenotype and the challenges of electronic health record (EHR)-derived data. Expert commentary: The authors hypothesize that through unsupervised machine learning, data-driven approaches can be used to define phenotypes rather than relying on expert clinician knowledge. Through the use of machine learning and an unbiased set of features extracted from clinical repositories, researchers will have the potential to further understand complex traits and identify patient subgroups. This knowledge may lead to more preventative and precise clinical care.",

        "Abstract": "The analysis of large biomedical data often presents with various challenges related to not just the size of the data, but also to data quality issues such as heterogeneity, multidimensionality, noisiness, and incompleteness of the data. The data-intensive nature of computational genomics problems in biomedical informatics warrants the development and use of massive computer infrastructure and advanced software tools and platforms, including but not limited to the use of cloud computing. Our session aims to address these challenges in handling big data for designing a study, performing analysis, and interpreting outcomes of these analyses. These challenges have been prevalent in many studies including those which focus on the identification of novel genetic variant-phenotype associations using data from sources like Electronic Health Records (EHRs) or multi-omic data. One of the biggest challenges to focus on is the imperfect nature of the biomedical data where a lot of noise and sparseness is observed. In our session, we will present research articles that can help in identifying innovative ways to recognize and overcome newly arising challenges associated with pattern recognition in biomedical data.",

We provide the PLatform for the Analysis, Translation, and Organization of large-scale data (PLATO), a software tool equipped to handle multi-omic data for hundreds of thousands of samples to explore complexity using genetic interactions, environment-wide association studies and gene-environment interactions, phenome-wide association studies, as well as copy number and rare variant analyses.

        "Abstract": "BAG3 is a multifunctional protein that can bind to heat shock proteins (Hsp) 70 through its BAG domain and to other partners through its WW domain, proline-rich (PXXP) repeat and IPV (Ile-Pro-Val) motifs. Its intracellular expression can be induced by stressful stimuli, while is constitutive in skeletal muscle, cardiac myocytes and several tumour types. BAG3 can modulate the levels, localisation or activity of its partner proteins, thereby regulating major cell pathways and functions, including apoptosis, autophagy, mechanotransduction, cytoskeleton organisation, motility. A secreted form of BAG3 has been identified in studies on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Secreted BAG3 can bind to a specific receptor, IFITM2, expressed on macrophages, and induce the release of factors that sustain tumour growth and the metastatic process. BAG3 neutralisation therefore appears to constitute a novel potential strategy in the therapy of PDAC and, possibly, other tumours.",

        "Abstract": "We performed a Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) to identify interrelationships between the immune system genetic architecture and a wide array of phenotypes from two de-identified electronic health record (EHR) biorepositories. We selected variants within genes encoding critical factors in the immune system and variants with known associations with autoimmunity. To define case/control status for EHR diagnoses, we used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes from 3,024 Geisinger Clinic MyCode\u00ae subjects (470 diagnoses) and 2,899 Vanderbilt University Medical Center BioVU biorepository subjects (380 diagnoses). A pooled-analysis was also carried out for the replicating results of the two data sets. We identified new associations with potential biological relevance including SNPs in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and ankyrin-related genes associated with acute and chronic sinusitis and acute respiratory tract infection. The two most significant associations identified were for the C6orf10 SNP rs6910071 and \"rheumatoid arthritis\" (ICD-9 code category 714) (pMETAL = 2.58 x 10-9) and the ATN1 SNP rs2239167 and \"diabetes mellitus, type 2\" (ICD-9 code category 250) (pMETAL = 6.39 x 10-9). This study highlights the utility of using PheWAS in conjunction with EHRs to discover new genotypic-phenotypic associations for immune-system related genetic loci.",

The databases within LOKI provide variant details, regional annotations and pathway interactions which can be used to generate bins of biologically-related variants, thereby increasing the power of any subsequent statistical test. In this study, we expand the framework of BioBin to incorporate statistical tests, including a dispersion-based test, SKAT, thereby providing the option of performing a unified collapsing and statistical rare variant analysis in one tool. Extensive simulation studies performed on gene-coding regions showed a Bin-KAT analysis to have greater power than BioBin-regression in all simulated conditions, including variants influencing the phenotype in the same direction, a scenario where burden tests often retain greater power. The use of Madsen- Browning variant weighting increased power in the burden analysis to that equitable with Bin-KAT; but overall Bin-KAT retained equivalent or higher power under all conditions. Bin-KAT was applied to a study of 82 pharmacogenes sequenced in the Marshfield Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP). We looked for association of these genes with 9 different phenotypes extracted from the electronic health record. This study demonstrates that Bin-KAT is a powerful tool for the identification of genes harboring low frequency variants for complex phenotypes.",

        "Abstract": "The incidence and death rate of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have increased in recent years, therefore the identification of novel targets for treatment is extremely important. Interactions between cancer and stromal cells are critically involved in tumour formation and development of metastasis. Here we report that PDAC cells secrete BAG3, which binds and activates macrophages, inducing their activation and the secretion of PDAC supporting factors. We also identify IFITM-2 as a BAG3 receptor and show that it signals through PI3K and the p38 MAPK pathways. Finally, we show that the use of an anti-BAG3 antibody results in reduced tumour growth and prevents metastasis formation in three different mouse models. In conclusion, we identify a paracrine loop involved in PDAC growth and metastatic spreading, and show that an anti-BAG3 antibody has therapeutic potential.",

Here, we show that BAG3 down-modulation resulted in reduced cell viability and enhanced PEITC-induced apoptosis largely more extensively in HeLa (HPV18(+)) rather than in C33A (HPV(-)) cervical carcinoma cell lines. Moreover, we demonstrate that BAG3 suppression led to a decrease of viral E6 oncoprotein and a concomitant recovery of p53 tumor suppressor, the best recognized target of E6 for proteasome degradation. E6 and p53 expression were modulated at protein level, since their respective mRNAs were unaffected. Taken together our findings reveal a novel role for BAG3 as host protein contributing to HPV18 E6-activated pro-survival strategies, and suggest a possible relevance of its expression levels in drug/radiotherapy-resistance of HPV18-bearing cervical carcinomas.",

        "Abstract": "BAG3, member the HSP70 co-chaperones family, has been shown to play a relevant role in the survival, growth and invasiveness of different tumor types. In this study, we investigate the expression of BAG3 in 66 specimens from different lung tumors and the role of this protein in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumor growth. Normal lung tissue did not express BAG3 while we detected the expression of BAG3 by immunohistochemistry in all the 13 squamous cell carcinomas, 13 adenocarcinomas and 4 large cell carcinomas. Furthermore, we detected BAG3 expression in 22 of the 36 SCLCs analyzed. The role on SCLC cell survival was determined by down-regulating BAG3 levels in two human SCLC cell lines, i.e. H69 and H446, in vitro and measuring cisplatin induced apoptosis. Indeed down-regulation of BAG3 determines increased cell death and sensitizes cells to cisplatin treatment. The effect of BAG3 down-regulation on tumor growth was also investigated in an in vivo xenograft model by treating mice with an adenovirus expressing a specific bag3 siRNA. Treatment with bag3 siRNA-Ad significantly reduced tumor growth and improved animal survival. In conclusion we show that a subset of SCLCs over express BAG3 that exerts an anti-apoptotic effect resulting in resistance to chemotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "Vanadium compounds can exert anticancer effects, partly due to inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases. Here, we report the effect of N,N'-ethylenebis (pyridoxylideneiminato) vanadium (IV) complex (Pyr2 enV(IV)), that induced 93% and 57% of cell mortality in A375 (human melanoma) and A549 (human lung carcinoma) cells, respectively; the mortality was <24% in other cancer cell lines and in human normal epidermal keratinocytes, lung cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The mechanism of Pyr2 enV(IV) effect relied on apoptosis induction; this was triggered by ROS increase, followed by mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Indeed, the addition of N-acetyl cysteine to cell cultures abated Pyr2 enV(IV)-induced apoptosis. These results disclose the pro-apoptotic activity of Pyr2 enV(IV) and its mechanism, relying on intracellular ROS increase.",

This work aimed to test a 3-factor model of the neuropsychological assessment battery and evaluate how the model fit the data longitudinally. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to investigate the dimensions of a structured set of neuropsychological tests administered to a multicenter, international sample of independent older adults (LADIS study). Six hundred and thirty-eight older adults completed baseline neuropsychological, clinical, functional and motor assessments, which were repeated each year for a 3-year follow-up. CFA provided support for a 3-factor model. These factors involve the dimensions of executive functions, memory functions, and speed and motor control abilities. Performance decreased in most neuropsychological measures. Results showed that executive functioning, memory and speed of motor abilities are valid latent variables of neuropsychological performance among older adults, and that this structure is relatively consistent longitudinally, even though performance decreases with time.",

Since then, the anti-apoptotic activity of BAG3 has been confirmed in other tumor types, where it has been shown to regulate the intracellular concentration and localization of apoptosis-regulating factors, including NF-\u03baB-activating (IKK\u03b3) and Bcl2-family (Bax) proteins. Furthermore, growing evidences support its role in lymphoid and myeloid leukemia response to therapy. Moreover in the last years, the contribution of BAG3 to autophagy, a process known to be involved in the pathogenesis and response to therapy of leukemia cells, has been disclosed, opening a new avenue for the interpretation of the role of this protein in leukemias' biology.",

        "Abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the main regulator of physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Low molecular weight molecules able to stimulate angiogenesis have interesting medical application for example in regenerative medicine, but at present none has reached the clinic. We reported that a VEGF mimetic helical peptide, QK, designed on the VEGF helix sequence 17-25, is able to bind and activate the VEGF receptors, producing angiogenesis. In this study we evaluate the pharmacological properties of peptide QK with the aim to propose it as a VEGF-mimetic drug to be employed in reparative angiogenesis. We show that the peptide QK is able to recapitulate all the biological activities of VEGF in vivo and on endothelial cells. In experiments evaluating sprouting from aortic ring and vessel formation in an in vivo angiogenesis model, the peptide QK showed biological effects comparable with VEGF. At endothelial level, the peptide up-regulates VEGF receptor expression, activates intracellular pathways depending on VEGFR2, and consistently it induces endothelial cell proliferation, survival and migration. When added to angiogenic factors (VEGF and/or FGF-2), QK produces an improved biological action, which resulted in reduced apoptosis and accelerated in vitro wound healing. The VEGF-like activity of the short peptide QK, characterized by lower cost of production and easier handling compared to the native glycoprotein, suggests that it is an attractive candidate to be further developed for application in therapeutic angiogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are a frequent finding on brain MRI of elderly subjects, and have been associated with various risk factors, as well as with development of cognitive and functional impairment. While an overall association between WMH load and risk factors is well described, possible spatially restricted vulnerability remains to be established. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial distribution of WMH in normally functioning elderly subjects. We introduce a voxel-based approach in which lesion probability is mapped as a function of clinical risk factors using logistic regression, and validate the method using simulated datasets. The method was then applied in a total of 605 participants of the LADIS study (age 74 \u00b1 5 years, all with WMH), and the location of manually delineated WMH was investigated after spatial normalisation. Particularly strong and widespread associations were found for age, gender and hypertension. Different distribution patterns were found for men and women. Further, increased probability was found in association with self-reported alcohol and tobacco consumption, as well as in those with a history of migraine. It is concluded that the location of WMH is dependent on the risk factors involved pointing towards a regionally different pathogenesis and/or vulnerability of the white matter.",

        "Abstract": "Over the last 20 years, evidence about the clinical correlates of cerebral white matter changes (WMC; also called leukoaraiosis)has been accumulating. WMC are now listed among the neuroimaging expressions of cerebral small-vessel disease and are no longer considered an innocuous finding because they are associated, in cross-sectional surveys, with various disturbances and, in follow-up studies, with poor prognosis. The Leukoaraiosis And DISability (LADIS) study has contributed substantially to this body of knowledge.LADIS is a European multicenter collaboration that was started in 2001 with the aim of assessing the independent role of WMC in predicting disability in subjects aged 65\u201384. The main results of the LADIS study have been released in 2009 with the demonstration that severe WMC more than double the risk of transition from an autonomous to a dependent status after 3 years of follow-up. The LADIS study has also contributed more focused sub-studies assessing the possible role of WMC in the decline of cognitive and motor performances,depressive symptoms associated with aging and cerebrovascular diseases, urinary disturbances, and also the role of other brain lesions (lacunar infarcts, cerebral atrophy,and corpus callosum morphology). The LADIS study provides a good example of harmonization of instruments (MRI protocol, clinical, neuropsychological, and functional scales)within an international collaboration. Currently, the LADIS study is providing data about the natural history of WMC. In this paper, we review the background and the main results of the LADIS study. This review puts forward some considerations for future studies in the field.",

        "Abstract": "Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-dependent Cl(-) channel located in the plasma membrane, and its malfunction results in cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common lethal genetic disease in Caucasians. Most CF patients carry the deletion of Phe508 (\u0394F508 mutation); this mutation prevents the delivery of the CFTR to its correct cellular location, the apical (lumen-facing) membrane of epithelial cells. Molecular chaperones play a central role in determining the fate of \u0394F508-CFTR. In this report, we show that the Matrine, a quinolizidine alkaloid, downregulates the expression of the molecular chaperone HSC70 and increases the protein levels of \u0394F508-CFTR in human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549 cell line), stably transfected with a \u0394F508-CFTR-expressing construct. Moreover, Matrine induced \u0394F508-CFTR release from endoplasmic reticulum to cell cytosol and its localization on the cell membrane. Interestingly, downregulation of HSC70 resulted in increased levels of \u0394F508-CFTR complexes with the co-chaperone BAG3 that in addition appeared to co-localize with the mutated protein on the cell surface. These results shed new light on \u0394F508-CFTR interactions with proteins of the chaperones/co-chaperones system and could be useful in strategies for future medical treatments for CF.",

        "Abstract": "VEGF receptors have been the target of intense research aimed to develop molecules able to inhibit or stimulate angiogenesis. Based on the x-ray structure of the complex placental growth factor-VEGF receptor 1(D2), we designed a VEGF receptor-binding peptide reproducing the placental growth factor \u03b2-hairpin region Gln(87)-Val(100) that is involved in receptor recognition. A conformational analysis showed that the designed peptide adopts the expected fold in pure water. Moreover, a combination of NMR interaction analysis and cell binding studies were used to demonstrate that the peptide targets VEGF receptors. The VEGF receptor 1(D2)-interacting residues were characterized at the molecular level, and they correspond to the residues recognizing the placental growth factor sequence Gln(87)-Val(100). Finally, the peptide biological activity was characterized in vitro and in vivo, and it showed a VEGF-like behavior. Indeed, the peptide activated VEGF-dependent intracellular pathways, induced endothelial cell proliferation and rescue from apoptosis, and promoted angiogenesis in vivo. This compound is one of the few peptides known with proangiogenic activity, which makes it a candidate for the development of a novel peptide-based drug for medical applications in therapeutic angiogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Memory complaints are frequent in the elderly but its implications in cognition over time remain a controversial issue. Our objective was to evaluate the risk of self perceived memory complaints in the evolution for future dementia. The LADIS (Leukoaraiosis and Disability) prospective multinational European study evaluates the impact of white matter changes (WMC) on the transition of independent elderly subjects into disability. Independent elderly were enrolled due to the presence of WMC. Subjects were evaluated yearly during 3 years with a comprehensive clinical protocol and a neuropsychological battery. Dementia and subtypes of dementia were classified. Self perceived memory complaints in independent elderly were collected during the interview. MRI was performed at entry and at the end of the study. 639 subjects were included (74.1 \u00b1 5 years old, 55% women, 9.6 \u00b1 3.8 years of schooling). At end of follow-up, 90 patients were demented (vascular dementia, 54; Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD with vascular component, 34; frontotemporal dementia, 2). Using Cox regression analysis, we found that self perceived memory complaints were a strong predictor of AD and AD with vascular component during the follow-up (\u03b2 = 2.7, p = 0.008; HR = 15.5, CI 95% [2.04, 117.6]), independently of other confounders, namely depressive symptoms, WMC severity, medial temporal lobe atrophy, and global cognition status at baseline. Self perceived memory complaints did not predict vascular dementia. In the LADIS study, self perceived memory complaints predicted AD but not vascular dementia in elderly subjects with WMC living independently.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of this 3-year follow-up study was to investigate whether corpus callosum (CC) atrophy may predict future motor and cognitive impairment in an elderly population. On baseline MRI from 563 subjects with age-related white matter changes (ARWMC) from the Leukoaraiosis And DISability (LADIS) study, the CC was segmented and subdivided into five anterior-posterior regions (CC1-CC5). Associations between the CC areas and decline in motor performance and cognitive functions over a 3-year period were analyzed. CC atrophy at baseline was significantly associated with impaired cognitive performance (p<0.01 for CC1, p<0.05 for CC5), motor function (p<0.05 for CC2 and CC5), and walking speed (p<0.01 for CC2 and CC5, p<0.05 for CC3 and total CC), and with development of dementia at 3 years (p<0.05 for CC1) after correction for appropriate confounders (ARWMC volume, atrophy, age, gender and handedness). In conclusion, CC atrophy, an indicator of reduced functional connectivity between cortical areas, seems to contribute, independently of ARWMC load, to future cognitive and motor decline in the elderly.",

        "Abstract": "The expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BAG3 is induced in several cell types by exposure to high temperature, oxidants, and other stressful agents. We investigated whether exposure to 50\u2009Hz electromagnetic fields raised BAG3 levels in the human melanoma cell line M14, in vitro and in orthotopic xenografts. Exposure of cultured cells or xenografts for 6\u2009h or 4 weeks, respectively, produced a significant (P\u2009<\u20090.01) increase in BAG3 protein amounts. Interestingly, at the same times, we could not detect any significant variation in the levels of HSP70/72 protein or cell apoptosis. These results confirm the stressful effect of exposure to ELF in human cells, by identifying BAG3 protein as a marker of ELF-induced stress. Furthermore, they suggest that BAG3 induction by ELF may contribute to melanoma cell survival and/or resistance to therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Angiogenesis is a fundamental process underlining physiological and pathological conditions. It is mainly regulated by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors, which are the main targets of molecules able to modulate the angiogenic response. Pharmaceutical therapies based on antiangiogenic drugs represent a promising approach for the treatment of several socially important diseases. We report the biological and structural characterization of a VEGF receptor binder peptide designed on the N-terminal helix of VEGF. The reported experimental evidence shows that the peptide assumes in water a well-defined helical conformation and indicates that this peptide is a VEGF receptor antagonist and possesses antiangiogenic biological activity. In particular, it inhibits VEGF stimulated endothelial cell proliferation, activation, and survival, as well as angiogenesis and tumor progression in vivo. This peptide is a candidate for the development of novel peptide-based drugs for the treatment of diseases associated with excessive VEGF-dependent angiogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "BAG3, a member of the BAG family of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 cochaperones, is expressed in response to stressful stimuli in a number of normal cell types and constitutively in a variety of tumors, including pancreas carcinomas, lymphocytic and myeloblastic leukemias, and thyroid carcinomas. Down-regulation of BAG3 results in cell death, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of BAG3-dependent survival in human osteosarcoma (SAOS-2) and melanoma (M14) cells. We show that bag3 overexpression in tumors promotes survival through the NF-kappaB pathway. Indeed, we demonstrate that BAG3 alters the interaction between HSP70 and IKKgamma, increasing availability of IKKgamma and protecting it from proteasome-dependent degradation; this, in turn, results in increased NF-kappaB activity and survival. These results identify bag3 as a potential target for anticancer therapies in those tumors in which this gene is constitutively expressed. As a proof of principle, we show that treatment of a mouse xenograft tumor model with bag3siRNA-adenovirus that down-regulates bag3 results in reduced tumor growth and increased animal survival.",

        "Title": "Evidence for modulation of BAG3 by polyomavirus JC early protein.",
        "Abstract": "Polyomavirus JC (JCV) infects oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in the brain and is the cause of the demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). In cell culture, JCV infection is characterized by severe damage to cellular DNA, which begins early in infection, and a viral cytopathic effect, which is observed late in infection. Nevertheless, these JCV-infected cells show a low level of apoptosis, at both the early and late stages of infection. This suggests that there is conflicting interplay between viral anti-apoptotic pathways that seek to optimize virus production, e.g. through T antigen (T-Ag)-p53 interaction, and cellular pro-apoptotic pathways that seek to eliminate virally infected cells. The apoptosis regulatory protein BAG3 is a member of the human Bcl-2-associated athanogene (BAG) family of proteins, which function as molecular co-chaperones through their interaction with Hsc70/Hsp70 and function in the regulation of the cellular stress response, proliferation and apoptosis. This study showed that BAG3 protein is downregulated upon JCV infection and that this effect is mediated by JCV T-Ag via repression of the BAG3 promoter. The site of action of T-Ag was mapped to an AP2 site in the BAG3 promoter, and gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that T-Ag inhibited AP2 binding to this site, resulting in downregulation of BAG3 promoter expression. Using BAG3 and T-Ag expression and BAG3 siRNA, it was found that BAG3 and T-Ag had antagonistic effects on the induction of apoptosis, being anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic, respectively. The significance of these interactions to the JCV life cycle is discussed.",

        "Abstract": "The nucleic acid binding protein, Pur-alpha, is best characterized as a transcription factor with affinity to single stranded G/C rich regions. Pur-alpha exhibits developmental and tissue-specific regulation and plays a critical role in neuronal development and differentiation. Similar to Pur-alpha, the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is a developmentally regulated protein which promotes neuronal survival. Both the human and mouse AbetaPP promoters contain multiple G/C rich sequences which regulate AbetaPP at the transcriptional and translational levels. Using an in vitro reporter assay, we confirmed that Pur-alpha consensus binding sites within the human AbetaPP promoter down-regulate AbetaPP transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) showed direct binding of Pur-alpha to the AbetaPP promoter. Down regulation of AbetaPP went beyond the transcriptional level as overexpression of Pur-alpha in glial and fibroblast cell lines decreased basal levels of AbetaPP while siRNA targeting Pur-alpha increased basal levels of AbetaPP. Similar findings were observed in brain tissue and fibroblasts from mice with targeted deletion of Pur-alpha. These data point to a novel mechanism of controlling AbetaPP levels by the transcriptional regulatory protein, Pur-alpha, and suggest that Pur-alpha may be involved in the dysregulation of AbetaPP in Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Age-related white matter changes (WMC) are thought to be a marker of vascular pathology, and have been associated with motor and cognitive deficits. In the present study, an optimized artificial neural network was used as an automatic segmentation method to produce probabilistic maps of WMC in a clinical multi-center study. The neural network uses information from T1- and T2-weighted and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance (MR) scans, neighboring voxels and spatial location. Generalizability of the neural network was optimized by including the Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) pruning method in the training stage. Six optimized neural networks were produced to investigate the impact of different input information on WMC segmentation. The automatic segmentation method was applied to MR scans of 362 non-demented elderly subjects from 11 centers in the European multi-center study Leukoaraiosis And Disability (LADIS). Semi-manually delineated WMC were used for validating the segmentation produced by the neural networks. The neural network segmentation demonstrated high consistency between subjects and centers, making it a promising technique for large studies. For WMC volumes less than 10 ml, an increasing discrepancy between semi-manual and neural network segmentation was observed using the similarity index (SI) measure. The use of all three image modalities significantly improved cross-center generalizability compared to neural networks using the FLAIR image only. Expert knowledge not available to the neural networks was a minor source of discrepancy, while variation in MR scan quality constituted the largest source of error.",

        "Title": "Apoptosis inhibition in cancer cells: a novel molecular pathway that involves BAG3 protein.",
        "Abstract": "Stress-induced apoptosis regulates neoplasia pathogenesis and response to therapy. Indeed, cell transformation induces a stress response, that is overcome, in neoplastic cells, by alterations in apoptosis modulators; on the other hand, antineoplastic therapies largely trigger the apoptosis stress pathway, whose impairment results in resistance. Therefore, the study of the roles of apoptosis-modulating molecules in neoplasia development and response to therapy is of key relevance for our understanding of these processes. Among molecules that regulate apoptosis, a role is emerging for BAG3, a member of the BAG co-chaperone protein family. Proteins that share the BAG domain are characterized by their interaction with a variety of partners (heat shock proteins, steroid hormone receptors, Raf-1 and others), involved in regulating a number of cellular processes, including proliferation and apoptosis. BAG3, also known as CAIR-1 or Bis, forms a complex with the heat shock protein (Hsp) 70. This assists polypeptide folding, can mediate protein delivery to proteasome and is able to modulate apoptosis by interfering with cytochrome c release, apoptosome assembly and other events in the death process. It has been recently shown that, in human primary lymphoid and myeloblastic leukemias and other neoplastic cell types, BAG3 expression sustains cell survival and underlies resistance to therapy, through downmodulation of apoptosis. This review summarizes findings that assign an apoptotic role to BAG3 in some neoplastic cell types and identify the protein as a candidate target of therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Disability is a major negative consequence of aging, with impact on several domains of individual, familial, and social life, and a major source of expenditure for social systems. Preventing or delaying disability in the elderly depends not only on understanding the etiology of pathological processes causing disability, but also on the identification of the early stages of disability (preclinical disability). Vascular dementia may have an impact on disability with variable severity and patterns compared to nonvascular forms of dementia. Vascular cognitive impairment is consistent with a preclinical disability status in which cognitive impairment, already manifested, might not interfere substantially with everyday life activities, but might still cause subtle difficulties in selective performances, like those linked with executive functions. Instruments comprehensive and sensitive enough to describe global function in such a context should be specifically designed and validated.",

        "Abstract": "Age-related white matter changes (ARWMC) on brain MRI have been associated with cognitive, motor, mood and urinary disturbances. These factors are known to contribute to disability in elderly people, but the impact of ARWMC and of their progression on the transition to disability is not determined. The LADIS (Leukoaraiosis and Disability in the Elderly) study aims at assessing the role of ARWMC as an independent predictor of the transition to disability in initially nondisabled elderly (65-84 years). Subjects who are not impaired or impaired on only 1 item of the Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL) scale, presenting with different grades of ARWMC severity, were enrolled. Eleven European centers are involved. All the patients were assessed at baseline using an extensive set of clinical and functional tests including global functioning, cognitive, motor, psychiatric and quality of life measures. MRI studies were performed at baseline and will be repeated at the end of the follow-up period to evaluate changes of ARWMC and other lesions. ARWMC were categorized into mild, moderate or severe using the scale of Fazekas et al. For each ARWMC severity class, the primary study outcome is the transition to disability defined as an impairment on 2 or more IADL scale items. Secondary outcomes are the occurrence of dementia, depression, vascular events or death. Six-hundred and thirty-nine subjects (mean age 74.13 +/- 5.0 years, M/F: 288/351) were enrolled in a hospital-based setting and are being followed up for up to 3 years. The large and comprehensive set of measures in LADIS enables a comprehensive description of their functional and clinical features to be examined in relation to different morphological patterns and severity of ARWMC. The longitudinal design will give insight into the possible role of ARWMC and their progression as an independent contributor to disability in the elderly, eventually helping to develop preventive strategies to reduce the burden of disability in late life. The study results may also help to standardize, on an international basis, tools and criteria to identify early stages of disability.",

        "Abstract": "The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1 gene) is a candidate gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD), because it is a ligand for proteins involved in AD pathogenesis, such as apolipoprotein E (APOE), alpha2-macroglobulin (A2M), amyloid precursor protein (APP), and is located on chromosome 12, within a region linked with AD. An association between a silent polymorphism (C/T) in exon 3 and late onset AD has been reported, with an increased frequency of the C allele, although with conflicting results. We examined this polymorphism in a cohort of 166 sporadic AD patients and 225 sex- and age-matched nondemented controls from Southern Italy. No statistically significant differences were found in LRP1 genotype and allele frequencies between the whole AD sample and controls, nor in early- and late-onset subsets of AD patients. No statistically significant differences in frequencies between LRP1 alleles and AD among APOE allele, age, or gender strata were found. Finally, comparing our results with the findings from other European populations, the LRP1 C allele frequency showed a statistically significant decreasing trend from Northern to Southern regions of Europe, with a concomitant increase in LRP1 T allele frequency, but in AD patients only. Finally, in the AD sample, a decreasing geographical trend from North to South of Europe was found for LRP1 CC genotype, and an inverse trend for LRP1 CT genotype frequency. We suggest that these regional variations in LRP1 genotype and allele frequencies in AD could be related to the different patterns of association between this polymorphism and the disease in various European studies.",

        "Abstract": "Vascular factors may play a role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and increased serum apolipoprotein E (APOE) levels in AD could be of interest, as APOE concentration is associated with vascular disease. Aims of this study were to evaluate the influence of APOE genotype on serum APOE levels, and, secondly, to study serum APOE concentrations in relation to age and AD. APOE genotypes, serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio, triglycerides, and serum APOE were performed on 52 healthy centenarians, 49 AD patients, 45 age-matched controls, and 72 young healthy adults. In all study population a significant trend in reduction of serum APOE levels from APOE epsilon2- to epsilon4 carriers was observed. The difference in serum APOE levels among age groups significantly decreased in epsilon4 carriers only, including HDL cholesterol; no significant differences between AD patients and age-matched controls were found. In these highly selected populations, APOE genotype distribution strongly influences serum APOE concentration, not suggesting, at present, a possible role as a biochemical marker for AD, but only as a putative longevity factor.",
