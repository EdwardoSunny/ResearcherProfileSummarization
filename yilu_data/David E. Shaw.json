        "Abstract": "PIK3CA (PI3K\u03b1) is a lipid kinase commonly mutated in cancer, including \u223c40% of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The most frequently observed mutants occur in the kinase and helical domains. Orthosteric PI3K\u03b1 inhibitors suffer from poor selectivity leading to undesirable side effects, most prominently hyperglycemia due to inhibition of wild-type (WT) PI3K\u03b1. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and cryo-electron microscopy to identify an allosteric network that provides an explanation for how mutations favor PI3K\u03b1 activation. A DNA-encoded library screen leveraging electron microscopy-optimized constructs, differential enrichment, and an orthosteric-blocking compound led to the identification of RLY-2608, a first-in-class allosteric mutant-selective inhibitor of PI3K\u03b1. RLY-2608 inhibited tumor growth in PIK3CA-mutant xenograft models with minimal impact on insulin, a marker of dysregulated glucose homeostasis. RLY-2608 elicited objective tumor responses in two patients diagnosed with advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer with kinase or helical domain PIK3CA mutations, with no observed WT PI3K\u03b1-related toxicities.",

        "Abstract": "The cation channel TRPA1 is a potentially important drug target, and characterization of TRPA1 functional dynamics might help guide structure-based drug design. Here, we present results from long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations of TRPA1 with an allosteric activator, allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), in which we observed spontaneous transitions from a closed, non-conducting channel conformation into an open, conducting conformation. Based on these transitions, we propose a gating mechanism in which movement of a regulatory TRP-like domain allosterically translates into pore opening in a manner reminiscent of pore opening in voltage-gated ion channels. In subsequent experiments, we found that mutations that disrupt packing of the S4-S5 linker-TRP-like domain and the S5 and S6 helices also affected channel activity. In simulations, we also observed A-967079, a known allosteric inhibitor, binding between helices S5 and S6, suggesting that A-967079 may suppress activity by stabilizing a non-conducting pore conformation-a finding consistent with our proposed gating mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a negative regulator of the insulin and leptin signaling pathways, making it a highly attractive target for the treatment of type II diabetes. For PTP1B to perform its enzymatic function, a loop referred to as the \"WPD loop\" must transition between open (catalytically incompetent) and closed (catalytically competent) conformations, which have both been resolved by X-ray crystallography. Although prior studies have established this transition as the rate-limiting step for catalysis, the transition mechanism for PTP1B and other PTPs has been unclear. Here we present an atomically detailed model of WPD loop transitions in PTP1B based on unbiased, long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and weighted ensemble simulations. We found that a specific WPD loop region\u2500the PDFG motif\u2500acted as the key conformational switch, with structural changes to the motif being necessary and sufficient for transitions between long-lived open and closed states of the loop. Simulations starting from the closed state repeatedly visited open states of the loop that quickly closed again unless the infrequent conformational switching of the motif stabilized the open state. The functional importance of the PDFG motif is supported by the fact that it is well conserved across PTPs. Bioinformatic analysis shows that the PDFG motif is also conserved, and adopts two distinct conformations, in deiminases, and the related DFG motif is known to function as a conformational switch in many kinases, suggesting that PDFG-like motifs may control transitions between structurally distinct, long-lived conformational states in multiple protein families.",

        "Abstract": "Oncogenic activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) drives multiple cancers and represents a broad therapeutic opportunity, yet selective targeting of FGFR2 has not been achieved. Although the clinical efficacy of pan-FGFR inhibitors (pan-FGFRi) validates FGFR2 driver status in FGFR2 fusion-positive intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, their benefit is limited by incomplete target coverage due to FGFR1- and FGFR4-mediated toxicities (hyperphosphatemia and diarrhea, respectively) and the emergence of FGFR2 resistance mutations. RLY-4008 is a highly selective, irreversible FGFR2 inhibitor designed to overcome these limitations. In vitro, RLY-4008 demonstrates >250- and >5,000-fold selectivity over FGFR1 and FGFR4, respectively, and targets primary alterations and resistance mutations. In vivo, RLY-4008 induces regression in multiple xenograft models-including models with FGFR2 resistance mutations that drive clinical progression on current pan-FGFRi-while sparing FGFR1 and FGFR4. In early clinical testing, RLY-4008 induced responses without clinically significant off-isoform FGFR toxicities, confirming the broad therapeutic potential of selective FGFR2 targeting.",

        "Abstract": "Fragment-based drug discovery has led to six approved drugs, but the small sizes of the chemical fragments used in such methods typically result in only weak interactions between the fragment and its target molecule, which makes it challenging to experimentally determine the three-dimensional poses fragments assume in the bound state. One computational approach that could help address this difficulty is long-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which have been used in retrospective studies to recover experimentally known binding poses of fragments. Here, we present the results of long-timescale MD simulations that we used to prospectively discover binding poses for two series of fragments in allosteric pockets on a difficult and important pharmaceutical target, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1b (PTP1b). Our simulations reversibly sampled the fragment association and dissociation process. One of the binding pockets found in the simulations has not to our knowledge been previously observed with a bound fragment, and the other pocket adopted a very rare conformation. We subsequently obtained high-resolution crystal structures of members of each fragment series bound to PTP1b, and the experimentally observed poses confirmed the simulation results. To the best of our knowledge, our findings provide the first demonstration that MD simulations can be used prospectively to determine fragment binding poses to previously unidentified pockets.",

        "Abstract": "To perform their physiological functions, amino methyl propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) cycle through active, resting, and desensitized states, and dysfunction in AMPAR activity is associated with various neurological disorders. Transitions among AMPAR functional states, however, are largely uncharacterized at atomic resolution and are difficult to examine experimentally. Here, we report long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations of dimerized AMPAR ligand-binding domains (LBDs), whose conformational changes are tightly coupled to changes in AMPAR functional states, in which we observed LBD dimer activation and deactivation upon ligand binding and unbinding at atomic resolution. Importantly, we observed the ligand-bound LBD dimer transition from the active conformation to several other conformations, which may correspond with distinct desensitized conformations. We also identified a linker region whose structural rearrangements heavily affected the transitions to and among these putative desensitized conformations, and confirmed, using electrophysiology experiments, the importance of the linker region in these functional transitions.",

        "Abstract": "Proteins often undergo large conformational changes when binding small molecules, but atomic-level descriptions of such events have been elusive. Here, we report unguided molecular dynamics simulations of Abl kinase binding to the cancer drug imatinib. In the simulations, imatinib first selectively engages Abl kinase in its autoinhibitory conformation. Consistent with inferences drawn from previous experimental studies, imatinib then induces a large conformational change of the protein to reach a bound complex that closely resembles published crystal structures. Moreover, the simulations reveal a surprising local structural instability in the C-terminal lobe of Abl kinase during binding. The unstable region includes a number of residues that, when mutated, confer imatinib resistance by an unknown mechanism. Based on the simulations, NMR spectra, hydrogen-deuterium exchange measurements, and thermostability measurements and estimates, we suggest that these mutations confer imatinib resistance by exacerbating structural instability in the C-terminal lobe, rendering the imatinib-bound state energetically unfavorable.",

        "Title": "Gating and modulation of an inward-rectifier potassium channel.",
        "Abstract": "Inward-rectifier potassium channels (Kirs) are lipid-gated ion channels that differ from other K+ channels in that they allow K+ ions to flow more easily into, rather than out of, the cell. Inward rectification is known to result from endogenous magnesium ions or polyamines (e.g., spermine) binding to Kirs, resulting in a block of outward potassium currents, but questions remain regarding the structural and dynamic basis of the rectification process and lipid-dependent channel activation. Here, we present the results of long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations starting from a crystal structure of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-bound chicken Kir2.2 with a non-conducting pore. After introducing a mutation (G178R) that is known to increase the open probability of a homologous channel, we were able to observe transitions to a stably open, ion-conducting pore, during which key conformational changes occurred in the main activation gate and the cytoplasmic domain. PIP2 binding appeared to increase stability of the pore in its open and conducting state, as PIP2 removal resulted in pore closure, with a median closure time about half of that with PIP2 present. To investigate structural details of inward rectification, we simulated spermine binding to and unbinding from the open pore conformation at positive and negative voltages, respectively, and identified a spermine-binding site located near a previously hypothesized site between the pore cavity and the selectivity filter. We also studied the effects of long-range electrostatics on conduction and spermine binding by mutating charged residues in the cytoplasmic domain and found that a finely tuned charge density, arising from basic and acidic residues within the cytoplasmic domain, modulated conduction and rectification.",

        "Abstract": "A key step in the emergence of human pandemic influenza strains has been a switch in binding preference of the viral glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) from avian to human sialic acid (SA) receptors. The conformation of the bound SA varies substantially with HA sequence, and crystallographic evidence suggests that the bound SA is flexible, making it difficult to predict which mutations are responsible for changing HA-binding preference. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of SA analogues binding to various HAs and observed a dynamic equilibrium among structurally diverse receptor conformations, including conformations that have not been experimentally observed. Using one such novel conformation, we predicted\u2500and experimentally confirmed\u2500a set of mutations that substantially increased an HA's affinity for a human SA analogue. This prediction could not have been inferred from the existing crystal structures, suggesting that MD-generated HA-SA conformational ensembles could help researchers predict human-adaptive mutations, aiding surveillance of emerging pandemic threats.",

        "Abstract": "Although molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used extensively to study the structural dynamics of proteins, the role of MD simulation in studies of nucleic acid based systems has been more limited. One contributing factor to this disparity is the historically lower level of accuracy of the physical models used in such simulations to describe interactions involving nucleic acids. By modifying nonbonded and torsion parameters of a force field from the Amber family of models, we recently developed force field parameters for RNA that achieve a level of accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art protein force fields. Here we report force field parameters for DNA, which we developed by transferring nonbonded parameters from our recently reported RNA force field and making subsequent adjustments to torsion parameters. We have also modified the backbone charges in both the RNA and DNA parameter sets to make the treatment of electrostatics compatible with our recently developed variant of the Amber protein and ion force field. We name the force field resulting from the union of these three parameter sets (the new DNA parameters, the revised RNA parameters, and the existing protein and ion parameters) ",

        "Title": "How does a small molecule bind at a cryptic binding site?",
        "Abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are ubiquitous biomolecular processes that are central to virtually all aspects of cellular function. Identifying small molecules that modulate specific disease-related PPIs is a strategy with enormous promise for drug discovery. The design of drugs to disrupt PPIs is challenging, however, because many potential drug-binding sites at PPI interfaces are \"cryptic\": When unoccupied by a ligand, cryptic sites are often flat and featureless, and thus not readily recognizable in crystal structures, with the geometric and chemical characteristics of typical small-molecule binding sites only emerging upon ligand binding. The rational design of small molecules to inhibit specific PPIs would benefit from a better understanding of how such molecules bind at PPI interfaces. To this end, we have conducted unbiased, all-atom MD simulations of the binding of four small-molecule inhibitors (SP4206 and three SP4206 analogs) to interleukin 2 (IL2)-which performs its function by forming a PPI with its receptor-without incorporating any prior structural information about the ligands' binding. In multiple binding events, a small molecule settled into a stable binding pose at the PPI interface of IL2, resulting in a protein-small-molecule binding site and pose virtually identical to that observed in an existing crystal structure of the IL2-SP4206 complex. Binding of the small molecule stabilized the IL2 binding groove, which when the small molecule was not bound emerged only transiently and incompletely. Moreover, free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations successfully distinguished between the native and non-native IL2-small-molecule binding poses found in the simulations, suggesting that binding simulations in combination with FEP may provide an effective tool for identifying cryptic binding sites and determining the binding poses of small molecules designed to disrupt PPI interfaces by binding to such sites.",

        "Abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are implicated in many human diseases. They have generally not been amenable to conventional structure-based drug design, however, because their intrinsic conformational variability has precluded an atomic-level understanding of their binding to small molecules. Here we present long-time-scale, atomic-level molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of monomeric \u03b1-synuclein (an IDP whose aggregation is associated with Parkinson's disease) binding the small-molecule drug fasudil in which the observed protein-ligand interactions were found to be in good agreement with previously reported NMR chemical shift data. In our simulations, fasudil, when bound, favored certain charge-charge and \u03c0-stacking interactions near the C terminus of \u03b1-synuclein but tended not to form these interactions simultaneously, rather breaking one of these interactions and forming another nearby (a mechanism we term ",

        "Abstract": "Effective inactivation of the HER2-HER3 tumor driver has remained elusive because of the challenging attributes of the pseudokinase HER3. We report a structure-function study of constitutive HER2-HER3 signaling to identify opportunities for targeting. The allosteric activation of the HER2 kinase domain (KD) by the HER3 KD is required for tumorigenic signaling and can potentially be targeted by allosteric inhibitors. ATP binding within the catalytically inactive HER3 KD provides structural rigidity that is important for signaling, but this is mimicked, not opposed, by small molecule ATP analogs, reported here in a bosutinib-bound crystal structure. Mutational disruption of ATP binding and molecular dynamics simulation of the apo KD of HER3 identify a conformational coupling of the ATP pocket with a hydrophobic AP-2 pocket, analogous to EGFR, that is critical for tumorigenic signaling and feasible for targeting. The value of these potential target sites is confirmed in tumor growth assays using gene replacement techniques.",

        "Abstract": "The protein K-Ras functions as a molecular switch in signaling pathways regulating cell growth. In the human mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is implicated in many cancers, multiple K-Ras proteins are thought to assemble at the cell membrane with Ras effector proteins from the Raf family. Here we propose an atomistic structural model for such an assembly. Our starting point was an asymmetric guanosine triphosphate-mediated K-Ras dimer model, which we generated using unbiased molecular dynamics simulations and verified with mutagenesis experiments. Adding further K-Ras monomers in a head-to-tail fashion led to a compact helical assembly, a model we validated using electron microscopy and cell-based experiments. This assembly stabilizes K-Ras in its active state and presents composite interfaces to facilitate Raf binding. Guided by existing experimental data, we then positioned C-Raf, the downstream kinase MEK1 and accessory proteins (Galectin-3 and 14-3-3\u03c3) on and around the helical assembly. The resulting Ras-Raf signalosome model offers an explanation for a large body of data on MAPK signaling.",

The link between receptor tetramerization and the mechanism of kinase activation, however, has not been elucidated. Here, using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, combined with analysis of SMAD signaling, we show that the kinase domain of the type I receptor ALK2 and type II receptor BMPR2 form a heterodimeric complex via their C-terminal lobes. Formation of this dimer is essential for ligand-induced receptor signaling and is targeted by mutations in BMPR2 in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We further show that the type I/type II kinase domain heterodimer serves as the scaffold for assembly of the active tetrameric receptor complexes to enable phosphorylation of the GS domain and activation of SMADs.",

Here we present evidence that backtracking extends into the viral realm, where backtracking by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) may aid viral transcription and replication. Structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp bound to the essential nsp13 helicase and RNA suggested the helicase facilitates backtracking. We use cryo-electron microscopy, RNA-protein cross-linking, and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp backtracking. The results establish that the single-stranded 3' segment of the product RNA generated by backtracking extrudes through the RdRp nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry tunnel, that a mismatched nucleotide at the product RNA 3' end frays and enters the NTP entry tunnel to initiate backtracking, and that nsp13 stimulates RdRp backtracking. Backtracking may aid proofreading, a crucial process for SARS-CoV-2 resistance against antivirals.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in computational chemistry create an ongoing need for larger and higher-quality datasets that characterize noncovalent molecular interactions. We present three benchmark collections of quantum mechanical data, covering approximately 3,700 distinct types of interacting molecule pairs. The first collection, which we refer to as DES370K, contains interaction energies for more than 370,000 dimer geometries. These were computed using the coupled-cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)], which is widely regarded as the gold-standard method in electronic structure theory. Our second benchmark collection, a core representative subset of DES370K called DES15K, is intended for more computationally demanding applications of the data. Finally, DES5M, our third collection, comprises interaction energies for nearly 5,000,000 dimer geometries; these were calculated using SNS-MP2, a machine learning approach that provides results with accuracy comparable to that of our coupled-cluster training data. These datasets may prove useful in the development of density functionals, empirically corrected wavefunction-based approaches, semi-empirical methods, force fields, and models trained using machine learning methods.",

RAFi equipotent for mBRAF and dBRAF have been developed but are predicted to have lower therapeutic index. Here we identify a third class of RAFi that selectively inhibits dBRAF over mBRAF. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal restriction of the movement of the BRAF \u03b1C-helix as the basis of inhibitor selectivity. Combination of inhibitors based on their conformation selectivity (mBRAF- plus dBRAF-selective plus the most potent BRAF-MEK disruptor MEK inhibitor) promoted suppression of tumor growth in BRAF",

        "Abstract": "Transferring particle charges to and from a grid plays a central role in the particle-mesh algorithms widely used to evaluate the electrostatic energy in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The computational cost of this transfer process represents a substantial part of the overall time required for simulation and is primarily determined by the size of the support (the set of grid nodes at which the transfer function is evaluated). The accuracy of the resulting approximation depends on the form of the transfer function, of which several have been proposed, as well as the size and shape of its support. Here, we show how to derive the transfer function that yields maximal asymptotic accuracy for a given support in the limit of fine grid resolution, finding that all such functions are splines, and we determine these functions (which we refer to as midtown splines) for a variety of choices of support to find optimally efficient transfer functions at accuracy levels relevant to MD simulations. We describe midtown splines that achieve fourth- and sixth-order accuracy in the grid spacing while requiring a support size of 32 and 88 grid nodes, respectively, compared to the 64 and 216 nodes required by the most widely used transfer functions (B-splines). At accuracy levels typically used in MD simulations, the use of midtown splines thus cuts the time required for charge spreading by roughly a factor of two.",

        "Abstract": "Drug discovery projects entail cycles of design, synthesis, and testing that yield a series of chemically related small molecules whose properties, such as binding affinity to a given target protein, are progressively tailored to a particular drug discovery goal. The use of deep-learning technologies could augment the typical practice of using human intuition in the design cycle, and thereby expedite drug discovery projects. Here, we present DESMILES, a deep neural network model that advances the state of the art in machine learning approaches to molecular design. We applied DESMILES to a previously published benchmark that assesses the ability of a method to modify input molecules to inhibit the dopamine receptor D2, and DESMILES yielded a 77% lower failure rate compared to state-of-the-art models. To explain the ability of DESMILES to hone molecular properties, we visualize a layer of the DESMILES network, and further demonstrate this ability by using DESMILES to tailor the same molecules used in the D2 benchmark test to dock more potently against seven different receptors.",

        "Abstract": "AZD9291 (Osimertinib) is highly effective in treating EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with T790M-mediated drug resistance. Despite the remarkable success of AZD9291, its binding pose with EGFR T790M remains unclear. Here, we report unbiased, atomic-level molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in which spontaneous association of AZD9291 with EGFR kinases having WT and T790M mutant gatekeepers was observed. Simulation-generated structural models suggest that the binding pose of AZD9291 with T790M differs from its binding pose with the WT, and that AZD9291 interacts extensively with the gatekeeper residue (Met 790) in T790M but not with Thr 790 in the WT, which explains why AZD9291 binds T790M with higher affinity. The MD simulation-generated models were confirmed by experimentally determined EGFR/T790M complex crystal structures. This work may facilitate the rational design of drugs that can overcome resistance mutations to AZD9291, and more generally it suggests the potential of using unbiased MD simulation to elucidate small-molecule binding poses.",

Generating pharmacophore models from protein structures is typically a manual process, but there has been growing interest in automated pharmacophore generation methods. Automation makes feasible the processing of large numbers of protein conformations, such as those generated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and thus may help achieve the longstanding goal of incorporating protein flexibility into virtual screening workflows. Here, we present AutoPH4, a new automated method for generating pharmacophore models based on protein structures; we show that a virtual screening workflow incorporating AutoPH4 ranks compounds more accurately than any other pharmacophore-based virtual screening workflow for which results on a public benchmark have been reported. The strong performance of the virtual screening workflow indicates that the AutoPH4 component of the workflow generates high-quality pharmacophores, making AutoPH4 promising for use in future virtual screening workflows as well, such as ones that use conformations generated by MD simulations.",

        "Abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which in isolation do not adopt a well-defined tertiary structure but instead populate a structurally heterogeneous ensemble of interconverting states, play important roles in many biological pathways. IDPs often fold into ordered states upon binding to their physiological interaction partners (a so-called \"folding-upon-binding\" process), but it has proven difficult to obtain an atomic-level description of the structural mechanisms by which they do so. Here, we describe in atomic detail the folding-upon-binding mechanism of an IDP segment to its binding partner, as observed in unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. In our simulations, we observed over 70 binding and unbinding events between the \u03b1-helical molecular recognition element (\u03b1-MoRE) of the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein (N",

        "Abstract": "The evaluation of electrostatic energy for a set of point charges in a periodic lattice is a computationally expensive part of molecular dynamics simulations (and other applications) because of the long-range nature of the Coulomb interaction. A standard approach is to decompose the Coulomb potential into a near part, typically evaluated by direct summation up to a cutoff radius, and a far part, typically evaluated in Fourier space. In practice, all decomposition approaches involve approximations-such as cutting off the near-part direct sum-but it may be possible to find new decompositions with improved trade-offs between accuracy and performance. Here, we present the u-series, a new decomposition of the Coulomb potential that is more accurate than the standard (Ewald) decomposition for a given amount of computational effort and achieves the same accuracy as the Ewald decomposition with approximately half the computational effort. These improvements, which we demonstrate numerically using a lipid membrane system, arise because the u-series is smooth on the entire real axis and exact up to the cutoff radius. Additional performance improvements over the Ewald decomposition may be possible in certain situations because the far part of the u-series is a sum of Gaussians and can thus be evaluated using algorithms that require a separable convolution kernel; we describe one such algorithm that reduces communication latency at the expense of communication bandwidth and computation, a trade-off that may be advantageous on modern massively parallel supercomputers.",

        "Abstract": "The accuracy of atomistic physics-based force fields for the simulation of biological macromolecules has typically been benchmarked experimentally using biophysical data from simple, often single-chain systems. In the case of proteins, the careful refinement of force field parameters associated with torsion-angle potentials and the use of improved water models have enabled a great deal of progress toward the highly accurate simulation of such monomeric systems in both folded and, more recently, disordered states. In living organisms, however, proteins constantly interact with other macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, and these interactions are often essential for proper biological function. Here, we show that state-of-the-art force fields tuned to provide an accurate description of both ordered and disordered proteins can be limited in their ability to accurately describe protein-protein complexes. This observation prompted us to perform an extensive reparameterization of one variant of the Amber protein force field. Our objective involved refitting not only the parameters associated with torsion-angle potentials but also the parameters used to model nonbonded interactions, the specification of which is expected to be central to the accurate description of multicomponent systems. The resulting force field, which we call ",

Our ability to find and progress fragment hits could potentially be improved by enhancing our understanding of their binding properties, which to date has largely been based on tacit knowledge and reports from individual projects. In the work reported here, we systematically analyzed the molecular and binding properties of fragment hits using 489 published protein-fragment complexes. We identified a number of notable features that these hits tend to have in common, including preferences in buried surface area upon binding, hydrogen bonding and other directional interactions with the protein targets, structural topology, functional-group occurrence, and degree of carbon saturation. In the future, taking account of these preferences in designing and selecting fragments to screen against protein targets may increase the chances of success in fragment screening campaigns.",

Here, we report the results of atomic-level simulations in which we observed five protein-protein pairs repeatedly associate to, and dissociate from, their experimentally determined native complexes using a molecular dynamics (MD)-based sampling approach that does not make use of any prior structural information about the complexes. To study association mechanisms, we performed additional, conventional MD simulations, in which we observed numerous spontaneous association events. A shared feature of native association for these five structurally and functionally diverse protein systems was that if the proteins made contact far from the native interface, the native state was reached by dissociation and eventual reassociation near the native interface, rather than by extensive interfacial exploration while the proteins remained in contact. At the transition state (the conformational ensemble from which association to the native complex and dissociation are equally likely), the protein-protein interfaces were still highly hydrated, and no more than 20% of native contacts had formed.",

        "Abstract": "Our current understanding of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) autoinhibition is based on X-ray structural data of monomer and dimer receptor fragments and does not explain how mutations achieve ligand-independent phosphorylation. Using a repertoire of imaging technologies and simulations we reveal an extracellular head-to-head interaction through which ligand-free receptor polymer chains of various lengths assemble. The architecture of the head-to-head interaction prevents kinase-mediated dimerisation. The latter, afforded by mutation or intracellular treatments, splits the autoinhibited head-to-head polymers to form stalk-to-stalk flexible non-extended dimers structurally coupled across the plasma membrane to active asymmetric tyrosine kinase dimers, and extended dimers coupled to inactive symmetric kinase dimers. Contrary to the previously proposed main autoinhibitory function of the inactive symmetric kinase dimer, our data suggest that only dysregulated species bear populations of symmetric and asymmetric kinase dimers that coexist in equilibrium at the plasma membrane under the modulation of the C-terminal domain.",

        "Title": "Atomic-Level Description of Protein Folding inside the GroEL Cavity.",
        "Abstract": "Chaperonins (ubiquitous facilitators of protein folding) sequester misfolded proteins within an internal cavity, thus preventing protein aggregation during the process of refolding. GroEL, a tetradecameric bacterial chaperonin, is one of the most studied chaperonins, but the role of the internal cavity in the refolding process is still unclear. It has been suggested that rather than simply isolating proteins while they refold, the GroEL cavity actively promotes protein folding. A detailed characterization of the folding dynamics and thermodynamics of protein substrates encapsulated within the cavity, however, has been difficult to obtain by experimental means, due to the system's complexity and the many steps in the folding cycle. Here, we examine the influence of the GroEL cavity on protein folding based on the results of unbiased, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We first verified that the computational setup, which uses a recently developed state-of-the-art force field that more accurately reproduces the aggregation propensity of unfolded states, could recapitulate the essential structural dynamics of GroEL. In these simulations, the GroEL tetradecamer was highly dynamic, transitioning among states corresponding to most of the structures that have been observed experimentally. We then simulated a small, unfolded protein both in the GroEL cavity and in bulk solution and compared the protein's folding process within these two environments. Inside the GroEL cavity, the unfolded protein interacted strongly with the disordered residues in GroEL's C-terminal tails. These interactions stabilized the protein's unfolded states relative to its compact states and increased the roughness of its folding free-energy surface, resulting in slower folding compared to the rate in solution. For larger proteins, which are more typical GroEL substrates, we speculate that these interactions may allow substrates to more quickly escape kinetic traps associated with compact, misfolded states, thereby actively promoting folding.",

        "Abstract": "The pathways that G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands follow as they bind to or dissociate from their receptors are largely unknown. Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) is a GPCR activated by intramolecular binding of a tethered agonist peptide that is exposed by thrombin cleavage. By contrast, the PAR1 antagonist vorapaxar is a lipophilic drug that binds in a pocket almost entirely occluded from the extracellular solvent. The binding and dissociation pathway of vorapaxar is unknown. Starting with the crystal structure of vorapaxar bound to PAR1, we performed temperature-accelerated molecular dynamics simulations of ligand dissociation. In the majority of simulations, vorapaxar exited the receptor laterally into the lipid bilayer through openings in the transmembrane helix (TM) bundle. Prior to full dissociation, vorapaxar paused in metastable intermediates stabilized by interactions with the receptor and lipid headgroups. Derivatives of vorapaxar with alkyl chains predicted to extend between TM6 and TM7 into the lipid bilayer inhibited PAR1 with apparent on rates similar to that of the parent compound in cell signaling assays. These data are consistent with vorapaxar binding to PAR1 via a pathway that passes between TM6 and TM7 from the lipid bilayer, in agreement with the most consistent pathway observed by molecular dynamics. While there is some evidence of entry of the ligand into rhodopsin and lipid-activated GPCRs from the cell membrane, our study provides the first such evidence for a peptide-activated GPCR and suggests that metastable intermediates along drug binding and dissociation pathways can be stabilized by specific interactions between lipids and the ligand.",

It has been unclear, however, whether any physical model (force field) used in MD simulations accurately describes both folded and disordered proteins. Here, we select a benchmark set of 21 systems, including folded and disordered proteins, simulate these systems with six state-of-the-art force fields, and compare the results to over 9,000 available experimental data points. We find that none of the tested force fields simultaneously provided accurate descriptions of folded proteins, of the dimensions of disordered proteins, and of the secondary structure propensities of disordered proteins. Guided by simulation results on a subset of our benchmark, however, we modified parameters of one force field, achieving excellent agreement with experiment for disordered proteins, while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for folded proteins.

        "Abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has become a powerful tool for characterizing at an atomic level of detail the conformational changes undergone by proteins. The application of such simulations to RNA structures, however, has proven more challenging, due in large part to the fact that the physical models (\"force fields\") available for MD simulations of RNA molecules are substantially less accurate in many respects than those currently available for proteins. Here, we introduce an extensive revision of a widely used RNA force field in which the parameters have been modified, based on quantum mechanical calculations and existing experimental information, to more accurately reflect the fundamental forces that stabilize RNA structures. We evaluate these revised parameters through long-timescale MD simulations of a set of RNA molecules that covers a wide range of structural complexity, including single-stranded RNAs, RNA duplexes, RNA hairpins, and riboswitches. The structural and thermodynamic properties measured in these simulations exhibited dramatically improved agreement with experimentally determined values. Based on the comparisons we performed, this RNA force field appears to achieve a level of accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art protein force fields, thus significantly advancing the utility of MD simulation as a tool for elucidating the structural dynamics and function of RNA molecules and RNA-containing biological assemblies.",

        "Abstract": "Noncovalent interactions are of fundamental importance across the disciplines of chemistry, materials science, and biology. Quantum chemical calculations on noncovalently bound complexes, which allow for the quantification of properties such as binding energies and geometries, play an essential role in advancing our understanding of, and building models for, a vast array of complex processes involving molecular association or self-assembly. Because of its relatively modest computational cost, second-order M\u00f8ller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) theory is one of the most widely used methods in quantum chemistry for studying noncovalent interactions. MP2 is, however, plagued by serious errors due to its incomplete treatment of electron correlation, especially when modeling van der Waals interactions and \u03c0-stacked complexes. Here we present spin-network-scaled MP2 (SNS-MP2), a new semi-empirical MP2-based method for dimer interaction-energy calculations. To correct for errors in MP2, SNS-MP2 uses quantum chemical features of the complex under study in conjunction with a neural network to reweight terms appearing in the total MP2 interaction energy. The method has been trained on a new data set consisting of over 200 000 complete basis set (CBS)-extrapolated coupled-cluster interaction energies, which are considered the gold standard for chemical accuracy. SNS-MP2 predicts gold-standard binding energies of unseen test compounds with a mean absolute error of 0.04 kcal mol",

        "Abstract": "A quantitative characterization of the binding properties of drug fragments to a target protein is an important component of a fragment-based drug discovery program. Fragments typically have a weak binding affinity, however, making it challenging to experimentally characterize key binding properties, including binding sites, poses, and affinities. Direct simulation of the binding equilibrium by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide a computational route to characterize fragment binding, but this approach is so computationally intensive that it has thus far remained relatively unexplored. Here, we perform MD simulations of sufficient length to observe several different fragments spontaneously and repeatedly bind to and unbind from the protein FKBP, allowing the binding affinities, on- and off-rates, and relative occupancies of alternative binding sites and alternative poses within each binding site to be estimated, thereby illustrating the potential of long time scale MD as a quantitative tool for fragment-based drug discovery. The data from the long time scale fragment binding simulations reported here also provide a useful benchmark for testing alternative computational methods aimed at characterizing fragment binding properties. As an example, we calculated binding affinities for the same fragments using a standard free energy perturbation approach and found that the values agreed with those obtained from the fragment binding simulations within statistical error.",

        "Abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling is activated by ligand-induced receptor dimerization. Notably, ligand binding also induces EGFR oligomerization, but the structures and functions of the oligomers are poorly understood. Here, we use fluorophore localization imaging with photobleaching to probe the structure of EGFR oligomers. We find that at physiological epidermal growth factor (EGF) concentrations, EGFR assembles into oligomers, as indicated by pairwise distances of receptor-bound fluorophore-conjugated EGF ligands. The pairwise ligand distances correspond well with the predictions of our structural model of the oligomers constructed from molecular dynamics simulations. The model suggests that oligomerization is mediated extracellularly by unoccupied ligand-binding sites and that oligomerization organizes kinase-active dimers in ways optimal for auto-phosphorylation in trans between neighbouring dimers. We argue that ligand-induced oligomerization is essential to the regulation of EGFR signalling.",

        "Abstract": "Human ubiquitin has been extensively characterized using a variety of experimental and computational methods and has become an important model for studying protein dynamics. Nevertheless, it has proven difficult to characterize the microsecond time scale dynamics of this protein with atomistic resolution. Here we use an unbiased computer simulation to describe the structural dynamics of ubiquitin on the picosecond to millisecond time scale. In the simulation, ubiquitin interconverts between a small number of distinct states on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. We find that the conformations visited by free ubiquitin in solution are very similar to those found various crystal structures of ubiquitin in complex with other proteins, a finding in line with previous experimental studies. We also observe weak but statistically significant correlated motions throughout the protein, including long-range concerted movement across the entire \u03b2 sheet, consistent with recent experimental observations. We expect that the detailed atomistic description of ubiquitin dynamics provided by this unbiased simulation may be useful in interpreting current and future experiments on this protein.",

        "Abstract": "How drugs dissociate from their targets is largely unknown. We investigated the molecular basis of this process in the adenosine A2Areceptor (A2AR), a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Through kinetic radioligand binding experiments, we characterized mutant receptors selected based on molecular dynamic simulations of the antagonist ZM241385 dissociating from the A2AR. We discovered mutations that dramatically altered the ligand's dissociation rate despite only marginally influencing its binding affinity, demonstrating that even receptor features with little contribution to affinity may prove critical to the dissociation process. Our results also suggest that ZM241385 follows a multistep dissociation pathway, consecutively interacting with distinct receptor regions, a mechanism that may also be common to many other GPCRs.",

        "Abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can describe protein motions in atomic detail, but transitions between protein conformational states sometimes take place on time scales that are infeasible or very expensive to reach by direct simulation. Enhanced sampling methods, the aim of which is to increase the sampling efficiency of MD simulations, have thus been extensively employed. The effectiveness of such methods when applied to complex biological systems like proteins, however, has been difficult to establish because even enhanced sampling simulations of such systems do not typically reach time scales at which convergence is extensive enough to reliably quantify sampling efficiency. Here, we obtain sufficiently converged simulations of three proteins to evaluate the performance of simulated tempering, a member of a widely used class of enhanced sampling methods that use elevated temperature to accelerate sampling. Simulated tempering simulations with individual lengths of up to 100 \u03bcs were compared to (previously published) conventional MD simulations with individual lengths of up to 1 ms. With two proteins, BPTI and ubiquitin, we evaluated the efficiency of sampling of conformational states near the native state, and for the third, the villin headpiece, we examined the rate of folding and unfolding. Our comparisons demonstrate that simulated tempering can consistently achieve a substantial sampling speedup of an order of magnitude or more relative to conventional MD.",

        "Title": "A Simple Model of Multivalent Adhesion and Its Application to Influenza Infection.",
        "Abstract": "Adhesion between biological surfaces, which is typically the result of molecular binding between receptors on one surface and ligands on another, plays a fundamental role in biology and is key to the infection mechanisms of certain viruses, including influenza. The physiological outcome of adhesion depends on both the number of bound cells (or viruses, or other biological particles) and the properties of the adhesion interface that is formed, including the equilibrium number of receptor-ligand connections. Here, we introduce a quantitative model for biological adhesion by adapting thermodynamic models developed for the related problem of multivalent molecular binding. In our model, adhesion affinity is approximated by a simple, analytical expression involving the numbers of ligands and receptors at the interface. Our model contains only two fitting parameters and is simple to interpret. When applied to the adhesion between the hemagglutinin ligands on influenza viruses and the sialic acid receptors on biosensors or on host cells, our model generates adhesion affinities consistent with experimental measurements performed over a range of numbers of receptors, and provides a semiquantitative estimate of the affinity range of the hemagglutinin-sialic acid interaction necessary for the influenza virus to successfully infect host cells. The model also provides a quantitative explanation for the experimental finding that a mutant avian virus gained transmissibility in mammals despite the mutations conferring only a less than twofold increase in the affinity of its hemagglutinin for mammalian receptors: the model predicts an order-of-magnitude improvement in adhesion to mammalian cells. We also extend our model to describe the competitive inhibition of adhesion: the model predicts that hemagglutinin inhibitors of relatively modest affinity can dramatically reduce influenza virus adhesion to host cells, suggesting that such inhibitors, if discovered, may be viable therapeutic agents against influenza.",

        "Abstract": "Experimental, theoretical, and computational studies of small proteins suggest that interresidue contacts not present in the folded structure play little or no role in the self-assembly mechanism. Non-native contacts can, however, influence folding kinetics by introducing additional local minima that slow diffusion over the global free-energy barrier between folded and unfolded states. Here, we combine single-molecule fluorescence with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to discover the structural origin for the slow diffusion that markedly decreases the folding rate for a designed \u03b1-helical protein. Our experimental determination of transition path times and our analysis of the simulations point to non-native salt bridges between helices as the source, which provides a quantitative glimpse of how specific intramolecular interactions influence protein folding rates by altering dynamics and not activation free energies.",

        "Abstract": "Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) comprise the major group of Ca2+-regulated kinases in plants and protists. It has long been assumed that CDPKs are activated, like other Ca2+-regulated kinases, by derepression of the kinase domain (KD). However, we found that removal of the autoinhibitory domain from Toxoplasma gondii CDPK1 is not sufficient for kinase activation. From a library of heavy chain-only antibody fragments (VHHs), we isolated an antibody (1B7) that binds TgCDPK1 in a conformation-dependent manner and potently inhibits it. We uncovered the molecular basis for this inhibition by solving the crystal structure of the complex and simulating, through molecular dynamics, the effects of 1B7-kinase interactions. In contrast to other Ca2+-regulated kinases, the regulatory domain of TgCDPK1 plays a dual role, inhibiting or activating the kinase in response to changes in Ca2+ concentrations. We propose that the regulatory domain of TgCDPK1 acts as a molecular splint to stabilize the otherwise inactive KD. This dependence on allosteric stabilization reveals a novel susceptibility in this important class of parasite enzymes.",

        "Abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a well-established tool for the computational study of protein structure and dynamics, but its application to the important problem of protein structure prediction remains challenging, in part because extremely long timescales can be required to reach the native structure. Here, we examine the extent to which the use of low-resolution information in the form of residue-residue contacts, which can often be inferred from bioinformatics or experimental studies, can accelerate the determination of protein structure in simulation. We incorporated sets of 62, 31, or 15 contact-based restraints in MD simulations of ubiquitin, a benchmark system known to fold to the native state on the millisecond timescale in unrestrained simulations. One-third of the restrained simulations folded to the native state within a few tens of microseconds-a speedup of over an order of magnitude compared with unrestrained simulations and a demonstration of the potential for limited amounts of structural information to accelerate structure determination. Almost all of the remaining ubiquitin simulations reached near-native conformations within a few tens of microseconds, but remained trapped there, apparently due to the restraints. We discuss potential methodological improvements that would facilitate escape from these near-native traps and allow more simulations to quickly reach the native state. Finally, using a target from the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment, we show that distance restraints can improve simulation accuracy: In our simulations, restraints stabilized the native state of the protein, enabling a reasonable structural model to be inferred.",

        "Abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) relay diverse extracellular signals into cells by catalyzing nucleotide release from heterotrimeric G proteins, but the mechanism underlying this quintessential molecular signaling event has remained unclear. Here we use atomic-level simulations to elucidate the nucleotide-release mechanism. We find that the G protein \u03b1 subunit Ras and helical domains-previously observed to separate widely upon receptor binding to expose the nucleotide-binding site-separate spontaneously and frequently even in the absence of a receptor. Domain separation is necessary but not sufficient for rapid nucleotide release. Rather, receptors catalyze nucleotide release by favoring an internal structural rearrangement of the Ras domain that weakens its nucleotide affinity. We use double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy and protein engineering to confirm predictions of our computationally determined mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "Research on change-point detection, the classical problem of detecting abrupt changes in sequential data, has focused predominantly on datasets with a single observable. A growing number of time series datasets, however, involve many observables, often with the property that a given change typically affects only a few of the observables. We introduce a general statistical method that, given many noisy observables, detects points in time at which various subsets of the observables exhibit simultaneous changes in data distribution and explicitly identifies those subsets. Our work is motivated by the problem of identifying the nature and timing of biologically interesting conformational changes that occur during atomic-level simulations of biomolecules such as proteins. This problem has proved challenging both because each such conformational change might involve only a small region of the molecule and because these changes are often subtle relative to the ever-present background of faster structural fluctuations. We show that our method is effective in detecting biologically interesting conformational changes in molecular dynamics simulations of both folded and unfolded proteins, even in cases where these changes are difficult to detect using alternative techniques. This method may also facilitate the detection of change points in other types of sequential data involving large numbers of observables--a problem likely to become increasingly important as such data continue to proliferate in a variety of application domains.",

Here, we combine equilibrium NMR measurements of thermal unfolding and long molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the folding of gpW, a protein with two-state-like, fast folding dynamics and cooperative equilibrium unfolding behavior. Experiments and simulations expose a remarkably complex pattern of structural changes that occur at the atomic level and from which the detailed network of residue-residue couplings associated with cooperative folding emerges. Such thermodynamic residue-residue couplings appear to be linked to the order of mechanistically significant events that take place during the folding process. Our results on gpW indicate that the methods employed in this study are likely to prove broadly applicable to the fine analysis of folding mechanisms in fast folding proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Many proteins can be partially or completely disordered under physiological conditions. Structural characterization of these disordered states using experimental methods can be challenging, since they are composed of a structurally heterogeneous ensemble of conformations rather than a single dominant conformation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations should in principle provide an ideal tool for elucidating the composition and behavior of disordered states at an atomic level of detail. Unfortunately, MD simulations using current physics-based models tend to produce disordered-state ensembles that are structurally too compact relative to experiments. We find that the water models typically used in MD simulations significantly underestimate London dispersion interactions, and speculate that this may be a possible reason for these erroneous results. To test this hypothesis, we create a new water model, TIP4P-D, that approximately corrects for these deficiencies in modeling water dispersion interactions while maintaining compatibility with existing physics-based models. We show that simulations of solvated proteins using this new water model typically result in disordered states that are substantially more expanded and in better agreement with experiment. These results represent a significant step toward extending the range of applicability of MD simulations to include the study of (partially or fully) disordered protein states.",

        "Abstract": "Protein tyrosine kinases are attractive drug targets because many human diseases are associated with the deregulation of kinase activity. However, how the catalytic kinase domain integrates different signals and switches from an active to an inactive conformation remains incompletely understood. Here we identify an allosteric network of dynamically coupled amino acids in Src kinase that connects regulatory sites to the ATP- and substrate-binding sites. Surprisingly, reactants (ATP and peptide substrates) bind with negative cooperativity to Src kinase while products (ADP and phosphopeptide) bind with positive cooperativity. We confirm the molecular details of the signal relay through the allosteric network by biochemical studies. Experiments on two additional protein tyrosine kinases indicate that the allosteric network may be largely conserved among these enzymes. Our work provides new insights into the regulation of protein tyrosine kinases and establishes a potential conduit by which resistance mutations to ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors can affect their activity.",

Previous work showed that increased affinity in the mature antibodies derives primarily from stabilization of the CDR H3 loop in the antigen-binding conformation. We have now used molecular dynamics simulations and existing crystal structures to identify potentially key maturation mutations, and we have characterized their effects on the CDR H3 loop and on antigen binding using further simulations and experimental affinity measurements, respectively. In the two maturation pathways, different contacts between light and heavy chains stabilize the CDR H3 loop. As few as two single-site mutations in each pathway can confer substantial loop stability, but none of them confers experimentally detectable stability on its own. Our results support models of the germinal center reaction in which two or more mutations can occur without concomitant selection and show how divergent pathways have yielded functionally equivalent antibodies.",

        "Abstract": "The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) tyrosine kinases homo- and heterodimerize to activate downstream signaling pathways. HER3 is a catalytically impaired member of the HER family that contributes to the development of several human malignancies and is mutated in a subset of cancers. HER3 signaling depends on heterodimerization with a catalytically active partner, in particular epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (the founding family member, also known as HER1) or HER2. The activity of homodimeric complexes of catalytically active HER family members depends on allosteric activation between the two kinase domains. To determine the structural basis for HER3 signaling through heterodimerization with a catalytically active HER family member, we solved the crystal structure of the heterodimeric complex formed by the isolated kinase domains of EGFR and HER3. The structure showed HER3 as an allosteric activator of EGFR and revealed a conserved role of the allosteric mechanism in activation of HER family members through heterodimerization. To understand the effects of cancer-associated HER3 mutations at the molecular level, we solved the structures of two kinase domains of HER3 mutants, each in a heterodimeric complex with the kinase domain of EGFR. These structures, combined with biochemical analysis and molecular dynamics simulations, indicated that the cancer-associated HER3 mutations enhanced the allosteric activator function of HER3 by redesigning local interactions at the dimerization interface.",

        "Abstract": "The type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) is involved in growth and survival of normal and neoplastic cells. A ligand-dependent conformational change is thought to regulate IGF1R activity, but the nature of this change is unclear. We point out an underappreciated dimer in the crystal structure of the related Insulin Receptor (IR) with Insulin bound that allows direct comparison with unliganded IR and suggests a mechanism by which ligand regulates IR/IGF1R activity. We test this mechanism in a series of biochemical and biophysical assays and find the IGF1R ectodomain maintains an autoinhibited state in which the TMs are held apart. Ligand binding releases this constraint, allowing TM association and unleashing an intrinsic propensity of the intracellular regions to autophosphorylate. Enzymatic studies of full-length and kinase-containing fragments show phosphorylated IGF1R is fully active independent of ligand and the extracellular-TM regions. The key step triggered by ligand binding is thus autophosphorylation.",

        "Abstract": "Trans-autophosphorylation is among the most prevalent means of protein kinase activation, yet its molecular basis is poorly defined. In Toll-like receptor and interleukin-1 receptor signaling pathways, the kinase IRAK4 is recruited to the membrane-proximal adaptor MyD88 through death domain (DD) interactions, forming the oligomeric Myddosome and mediating NF-\u03baB activation. Here we show that unphosphorylated IRAK4 dimerizes in solution with a KD of 2.5 \u03bcM and that Myddosome assembly greatly enhances IRAK4 kinase domain (KD) autophosphorylation at sub-KD concentrations. The crystal structure of the unphosphorylated IRAK4(KD) dimer captures a conformation that appears to represent the actual trans-autophosphorylation reaction, with the activation loop phosphosite of one IRAK4 monomer precisely positioned for phosphotransfer by its partner. We show that dimerization is crucial for IRAK4 autophosphorylation in vitro and ligand-dependent signaling in cells. These studies identify a mechanism for oligomerization-driven allosteric autoactivation of IRAK4 that may be general to other kinases activated by autophosphorylation.",

        "Abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a key role in regulating cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, and aberrant EGFR signaling is implicated in a variety of cancers. EGFR signaling is triggered by extracellular ligand binding, which promotes EGFR dimerization and activation. Ligand-binding measurements are consistent with a negatively cooperative model in which the ligand-binding affinity at either binding site in an EGFR dimer is weaker when the other site is occupied by a ligand. This cooperativity is widely believed to be central to the effects of ligand concentration on EGFR-mediated intracellular signaling. Although the extracellular portion of the human EGFR dimer has been resolved crystallographically, the crystal structures do not reveal the structural origin of this negative cooperativity, which has remained unclear. Here we report the results of molecular dynamics simulations suggesting that asymmetrical interactions of the two binding sites with the membrane may be responsible (perhaps along with other factors) for this negative cooperativity. In particular, in our simulations the extracellular domains of an EGFR dimer spontaneously lay down on the membrane in an orientation in which favorable membrane contacts were made with one of the bound ligands, but could not be made with the other. Similar interactions were observed when EGFR was glycosylated, as it is in vivo.",

        "Title": "Assessing the Accuracy of Two Enhanced Sampling Methods Using EGFR Kinase Transition Pathways: The Influence of Collective Variable Choice.",
        "Abstract": "Structurally elucidating transition pathways between protein conformations gives deep mechanistic insight into protein behavior but is typically difficult. Unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide one solution, but their computational expense is often prohibitive, motivating the development of enhanced sampling methods that accelerate conformational changes in a given direction, embodied in a collective variable. The accuracy of such methods is unclear for complex protein transitions, because obtaining unbiased MD data for comparison is difficult. Here, we use long-time scale, unbiased MD simulations of epidermal growth factor receptor kinase deactivation as a complex biological test case for two widely used methods-steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and the string method. We found that common collective variable choices, based on the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the entire protein, prevented the methods from producing accurate paths, even in SMD simulations on the time scale of the unbiased transition. Using collective variables based on the RMSD of the region of the protein known to be important for the conformational change, however, enabled both methods to provide a more accurate description of the pathway in a fraction of the simulation time required to observe the unbiased transition.",

        "Abstract": "Janus kinase-2 (JAK2) mediates signaling by various cytokines, including erythropoietin and growth hormone. JAK2 possesses tandem pseudokinase and tyrosine-kinase domains. Mutations in the pseudokinase domain are causally linked to myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in humans. The structure of the JAK2 tandem kinase domains is unknown, and therefore the molecular bases for pseudokinase-mediated autoinhibition and pathogenic activation remain obscure. Using molecular dynamics simulations of protein-protein docking, we produced a structural model for the autoinhibitory interaction between the JAK2 pseudokinase and kinase domains. A striking feature of our model, which is supported by mutagenesis experiments, is that nearly all of the disease mutations map to the domain interface. The simulations indicate that the kinase domain is stabilized in an inactive state by the pseudokinase domain, and they offer a molecular rationale for the hyperactivity of V617F, the predominant JAK2 MPN mutation.",

Although such studies have already begun to provide new insights into the process of protein folding, realizing the full potential of this approach will depend not only on simulation speed, but on the accuracy of the physical models ('force fields') on which such simulations are based. While experimental data are not available for comparison with all of the salient characteristics observable in long protein-folding simulations, we examine here the extent to which current force fields reproduce (and fail to reproduce) certain relevant properties for which such comparisons are possible.",

        "Abstract": "In molecular dynamics simulations, control over temperature and pressure is typically achieved by augmenting the original system with additional dynamical variables to create a thermostat and a barostat, respectively. These variables generally evolve on timescales much longer than those of particle motion, but typical integrator implementations update the additional variables along with the particle positions and momenta at each time step. We present a framework that replaces the traditional integration procedure with separate barostat, thermostat, and Newtonian particle motion updates, allowing thermostat and barostat updates to be applied infrequently. Such infrequent updates provide a particularly substantial performance advantage for simulations parallelized across many computer processors, because thermostat and barostat updates typically require communication among all processors. Infrequent updates can also improve accuracy by alleviating certain sources of error associated with limited-precision arithmetic. In addition, separating the barostat, thermostat, and particle motion update steps reduces certain truncation errors, bringing the time-average pressure closer to its target value. Finally, this framework, which we have implemented on both general-purpose and special-purpose hardware, reduces software complexity and improves software modularity.",

        "Abstract": "The design of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) allosteric modulators, an active area of modern pharmaceutical research, has proved challenging because neither the binding modes nor the molecular mechanisms of such drugs are known. Here we determine binding sites, bound conformations and specific drug-receptor interactions for several allosteric modulators of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2 receptor), a prototypical family A GPCR, using atomic-level simulations in which the modulators spontaneously associate with the receptor. Despite substantial structural diversity, all modulators form cation-\u03c0 interactions with clusters of aromatic residues in the receptor extracellular vestibule, approximately 15\u2009\u00c5 from the classical, 'orthosteric' ligand-binding site. We validate the observed modulator binding modes through radioligand binding experiments on receptor mutants designed, on the basis of our simulations, either to increase or to decrease modulator affinity. Simulations also revealed mechanisms that contribute to positive and negative allosteric modulation of classical ligand binding, including coupled conformational changes of the two binding sites and electrostatic interactions between ligands in these sites. These observations enabled the design of chemical modifications that substantially alter a modulator's allosteric effects. Our findings thus provide a structural basis for the rational design of allosteric modulators targeting muscarinic and possibly other GPCRs.",

        "Abstract": "Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are increasingly being used to describe the folding of individual proteins and protein domains at an atomic level of detail. Isolated protein domains, however, are rarely observed in vivo, where multidomain proteins and multimeric assemblies are far more common. It is clear that the folding of such proteins is often inextricably coupled with the process of dimerization; indeed, many protein monomers and protein domains are not stable in isolation, and fold to their native structures only when stabilized by interactions with other members of a protein complex. Here, we use equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with an aggregate simulation length of 4 ms to elucidate key aspects of the folding mechanism, and of the associated free-energy surface, of the Top7-CFr dimer, a 114-amino-acid protein homodimer with a mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 structure. In these simulations, we observed a number of folding and unfolding events. Each folding event was characterized by the assembly of two unfolded Top7-CFr monomers to form a stable, folded dimer. We found that the isolated monomer is unstable but that, early in the folding pathway, nascent native structure is stabilized by contacts between the two monomer subunits. These contacts are in some cases native, as in an induced-folding model, and in other cases non-native, as in a fly-casting mechanism. Occasionally, folding by conformational selection, in which both subunits form independently before dimerization, was also observed. Folding then proceeds through the sequential addition of strands to the protein \u03b2 sheet. Although the long-time-scale relaxation of the folding process can be well described by a single exponential, these simulations reveal the presence of a number of kinetic traps, characterized by structures in which individual strands are added in an incorrect order.",

        "Abstract": "The receptor tyrosine kinase Her2, an intensely pursued drug target, differs from other members of the EGFR family in that it does not bind EGF-like ligands, relying instead on heterodimerization with other (ligand-bound) EGFR-family receptors for activation. The structural basis for Her2 heterodimerization, however, remains poorly understood. The unexpected recent finding of asymmetric ectodomain dimer structures of Drosophila EGFR (dEGFR) suggests a possible structural basis for Her2 heterodimerization, but all available structures for dimers of human EGFR family ectodomains are symmetric. Here, we report results from long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations indicating that a single ligand is necessary and sufficient to stabilize the ectodomain interface of Her2 heterodimers, which assume an asymmetric conformation similar to that of dEGFR dimers. This structural parallelism suggests a dimerization mechanism that has been conserved in the evolution of the EGFR family from Drosophila to human. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00708.001.",

        "Title": "Rotational relaxation in ortho-terphenyl: using atomistic simulations to bridge theory and experiment.",
        "Abstract": "Understanding the nature of the glass transition--the dramatic slowing of dynamics and eventual emergence of a disordered solid from a cooling liquid--is a fundamental challenge in physical science. A central characteristic of glass-forming liquids is a non-exponential main relaxation process. The extent of deviation from exponential relaxation typically becomes more pronounced on cooling. Theories that predict a growth of spatially heterogeneous dynamics as temperature is lowered can explain these observations. In apparent contradiction to these theories, however, some experiments suggest that certain substances--notably including the intensely studied molecular glass-former ortho-terphenyl (OTP)--have a main relaxation process whose shape is essentially temperature independent, even though other observables predicted to be correlated with the degree of dynamical heterogeneity are temperature dependent. Here we report the first simulations based on an atomistic model of OTP that reach equilibrium at temperatures well into the supercooled regime. We first show that the results of these simulations are in reasonable quantitative agreement with experimental data for several basic properties over a wide range of temperatures. We then focus on rotational relaxation, finding nearly exponential behavior at high temperatures with clearly increasing deviations as temperature is lowered. The much weaker temperature dependence observed in light-scattering experiments also emerges from the same simulation data when we calculate correlation functions similar to those probed experimentally; this highlights the diversity of temperature dependencies that can be obtained with different probes. Further analysis suggests that the temperature insensitivity observed in the light-scattering experiments stems from the dependence of these measurements on internal as well as rotational molecular motion. Within the temperature range of our OTP simulations, our results strongly suggest that this archetypal glass-former behaves as anticipated by theories of the glass transition that predict increasing non-exponentiality with cooling, and our simulations thus strengthen the evidence supporting such theories.",

        "Abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors exhibit a wide variety of signaling behaviors in response to different ligands. When a small label was incorporated on the cytosolic interface of transmembrane helix 6 (Cys-265), (19)F NMR spectra of the \u03b22 adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) reconstituted in maltose/neopentyl glycol detergent micelles revealed two distinct inactive states, an activation intermediate state en route to activation, and, in the presence of a G protein mimic, a predominant active state. Analysis of the spectra as a function of temperature revealed that for all ligands, the activation intermediate is entropically favored and enthalpically disfavored. \u03b22AR enthalpy changes toward activation are notably lower than those observed with rhodopsin, a likely consequence of basal activity and the fact that the ionic lock and other interactions stabilizing the inactive state of \u03b22AR are weaker. Positive entropy changes toward activation likely reflect greater mobility (configurational entropy) in the cytoplasmic domain, as confirmed through an order parameter analysis. Ligands greatly influence the overall changes in enthalpy and entropy of the system and the corresponding changes in population and amplitude of motion of given states, suggesting a complex landscape of states and substates.",

        "Title": "Atomic-level simulation of current-voltage relationships in single-file ion channels.",
        "Abstract": "The difficulty in characterizing ion conduction through membrane channels at the level of individual permeation events has made it challenging to elucidate the mechanistic principles underpinning this fundamental physiological process. Using long, all-atom simulations enabled by special-purpose hardware, we studied K(+) permeation across the KV1.2/2.1 voltage-gated potassium channel. At experimentally accessible voltages, which include the physiological range, the simulated permeation rate was substantially lower than the experimentally observed rate. The current-voltage relationship was also nonlinear but became linear at much higher voltages. We observed permeation consistent with a \"knock-on\" mechanism at all voltages. At high voltages, the permeation rate was in accordance with our previously reported KV1.2 pore-only simulations, after the simulated voltages from the previous study were recalculated using the correct method, new insight into which is provided here. Including the voltage-sensing domains in the simulated channel brought the linear current-voltage regime closer to the experimentally accessible voltages. The simulated permeation rate, however, still underestimated the experimental rate, because formation of the knock-on intermediate occurred too infrequently. Reducing the interaction strength between the ion and the selectivity filter did not increase conductance. In complementary simulations of gramicidin A, similar changes in interaction strength did increase the observed permeation rate. Permeation nevertheless remained substantially below the experimental value, largely because of infrequent ion recruitment into the pore lumen. Despite the need to apply large voltages to simulate the permeation process, the apparent voltage insensitivity of the permeation mechanism suggests that the direct simulation of permeation at the single-ion level can provide fundamental physiological insight into ion channel function. Notably, our simulations suggest that the knock-on permeation mechanisms in KV1.2 and KcsA may be different.",

        "Abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key protein in cellular signaling, and its kinase domain (EGFR kinase) is an intensely pursued target of small-molecule drugs. Although both catalytically active and inactive conformations of EGFR kinase have been resolved crystallographically, experimental characterization of the transitions between these conformations remains difficult. Using unbiased, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we observed EGFR kinase spontaneously transition from the active to the so-called \"Src-like inactive\" conformation by way of two sets of intermediate conformations: One corresponds to a previously identified locally disordered state and the other to previously undescribed \"extended\" conformations, marked by the opening of the ATP-binding site between the two lobes of the kinase domain. We also simulated the protonation-dependent transition of EGFR kinase to another [\"Asp-Phe-Gly-out\" (\"DFG-out\")] inactive conformation and observed similar intermediate conformations. A key element observed in the simulated transitions is local unfolding, or \"cracking,\" which supports a prediction of energy landscape theory. We used hydrogen-deuterium (H/D) exchange measurements to corroborate our simulations and found that the simulated intermediate conformations correlate better with the H/D exchange data than existing active or inactive EGFR kinase crystal structures. The intermediate conformations revealed by our simulations of the transition process differ significantly from the existing crystal structures and may provide unique possibilities for structure-based drug discovery.",

        "Abstract": "Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, in which proteins spontaneously and repeatedly fold and unfold, have recently been used to help elucidate the mechanistic principles that underlie the folding of fast-folding proteins. The extent to which the conclusions drawn from the analysis of such proteins, which fold on the microsecond timescale, apply to the millisecond or slower folding of naturally occurring proteins is, however, unclear. As a first attempt to address this outstanding issue, we examine here the folding of ubiquitin, a 76-residue-long protein found in all eukaryotes that is known experimentally to fold on a millisecond timescale. Ubiquitin folding has been the subject of many experimental studies, but its slow folding rate has made it difficult to observe and characterize the folding process through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Here we determine the mechanism, thermodynamics, and kinetics of ubiquitin folding through equilibrium atomistic simulations. The picture emerging from the simulations is in agreement with a view of ubiquitin folding suggested from previous experiments. Our findings related to the folding of ubiquitin are also consistent, for the most part, with the folding principles derived from the simulation of fast-folding proteins, suggesting that these principles may be applicable to a wider range of proteins.",

The molecular determinants of drug-receptor binding kinetics remain poorly understood, however, especially when compared with the well-known factors that affect binding affinity.

        "Abstract": "Dimerization-driven activation of the intracellular kinase domains of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) upon extracellular ligand binding is crucial to cellular pathways regulating proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Inactive EGFR can exist as both monomers and dimers, suggesting that the mechanism regulating EGFR activity may be subtle. The membrane itself may play a role but creates substantial difficulties for structural studies. Our molecular dynamics simulations of membrane-embedded EGFR suggest that, in ligand-bound dimers, the extracellular domains assume conformations favoring dimerization of the transmembrane helices near their N termini, dimerization of the juxtamembrane segments, and formation of asymmetric (active) kinase dimers. In ligand-free dimers, by holding apart the N termini of the transmembrane helices, the extracellular domains instead favor C-terminal dimerization of the transmembrane helices, juxtamembrane segment dissociation and membrane burial, and formation of symmetric (inactive) kinase dimers. Electrostatic interactions of EGFR's intracellular module with the membrane are critical in maintaining this coupling.",

        "Abstract": "How the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activates is incompletely understood. The intracellular portion of the receptor is intrinsically active in solution, and to study its regulation, we measured autophosphorylation as a function of EGFR surface density in cells. Without EGF, intact EGFR escapes inhibition only at high surface densities. Although the transmembrane helix and the intracellular module together suffice for constitutive activity even at low densities, the intracellular module is inactivated when tethered on its own to the plasma membrane, and fluorescence cross-correlation shows that it fails to dimerize. NMR and functional data indicate that activation requires an N-terminal interaction between the transmembrane helices, which promotes an antiparallel interaction between juxtamembrane segments and release of inhibition by the membrane. We conclude that EGF binding removes steric constraints in the extracellular module, promoting activation through N-terminal association of the transmembrane helices.",

        "Abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can modulate diverse signaling pathways, often in a ligand-specific manner. The full range of functionally relevant GPCR conformations is poorly understood. Here, we use NMR spectroscopy to characterize the conformational dynamics of the transmembrane core of the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(2)AR), a prototypical GPCR. We labeled \u03b2(2)AR with (13)CH(3)\u03b5-methionine and obtained HSQC spectra of unliganded receptor as well as receptor bound to an inverse agonist, an agonist, and a G-protein-mimetic nanobody. These studies provide evidence for conformational states not observed in crystal structures, as well as substantial conformational heterogeneity in agonist- and inverse-agonist-bound preparations. They also show that for \u03b2(2)AR, unlike rhodopsin, an agonist alone does not stabilize a fully active conformation, suggesting that the conformational link between the agonist-binding pocket and the G-protein-coupling surface is not rigid. The observed heterogeneity may be important for \u03b2(2)AR's ability to engage multiple signaling and regulatory proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) is the prototypical member of a family of G-protein-coupled receptors that mediate cellular responses to thrombin and related proteases. Thrombin irreversibly activates PAR1 by cleaving the amino-terminal exodomain of the receptor, which exposes a tethered peptide ligand that binds the heptahelical bundle of the receptor to affect G-protein activation. Here we report the 2.2 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of human PAR1 bound to vorapaxar, a PAR1 antagonist. The structure reveals an unusual mode of drug binding that explains how a small molecule binds virtually irreversibly to inhibit receptor activation by the tethered ligand of PAR1. In contrast to deep, solvent-exposed binding pockets observed in other peptide-activated G-protein-coupled receptors, the vorapaxar-binding pocket is superficial but has little surface exposed to the aqueous solvent. Protease-activated receptors are important targets for drug development. The structure reported here will aid the development of improved PAR1 antagonists and the discovery of antagonists to other members of this receptor family.",

We describe a B-cell lineage expressing broadly neutralizing influenza virus antibodies derived from a subject immunized with the 2007 trivalent vaccine. The lineage comprises three mature antibodies, the unmutated common ancestor, and a common intermediate. Their heavy-chain complementarity determining region inserts into the conserved receptor-binding pocket of influenza HA. We show by analysis of structures, binding kinetics and long time-scale molecular dynamics simulations that antibody evolution in this lineage has rigidified the initially flexible heavy-chain complementarity determining region by two nearly independent pathways and that this preconfiguration accounts for most of the affinity gain. The results advance our understanding of strategies for developing more broadly effective influenza vaccines.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in simulation techniques and computing hardware have created a substantial overlap between the timescales accessible to atomic-level simulations and those on which the fastest-folding proteins fold. Here we demonstrate, using simulations of four variants of the human villin headpiece, how simulations of spontaneous folding and unfolding can provide direct access to thermodynamic and kinetic quantities such as folding rates, free energies, folding enthalpies, heat capacities, \u03a6-values, and temperature-jump relaxation profiles. The quantitative comparison of simulation results with various forms of experimental data probing different aspects of the folding process can facilitate robust assessment of the accuracy of the calculations while providing a detailed structural interpretation for the experimental observations. In the example studied here, the analysis of folding rates, \u03a6-values, and folding pathways provides support for the notion that a norleucine double mutant of villin folds five times faster than the wild-type sequence, but following a slightly different pathway. This work showcases how computer simulation has now developed into a mature tool for the quantitative computational study of protein folding and dynamics that can provide a valuable complement to experimental techniques.",

        "Abstract": "The protein tyrosine kinase JAK2 mediates signaling through numerous cytokine receptors. JAK2 possesses a pseudokinase domain (JH2) and a tyrosine kinase domain (JH1). Through unknown mechanisms, JH2 regulates the catalytic activity of JH1, and hyperactivating mutations in the JH2 region of human JAK2 cause myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). We showed previously that JAK2 JH2 is, in fact, catalytically active. Here we present crystal structures of human JAK2 JH2, including both wild type and the most prevalent MPN mutant, V617F. The structures reveal that JH2 adopts the fold of a prototypical protein kinase but binds Mg-ATP noncanonically. The structural and biochemical data indicate that the V617F mutation rigidifies \u03b1-helix C in the N lobe of JH2, facilitating trans-phosphorylation of JH1. The crystal structures of JH2 afford new opportunities for the design of novel JAK2 therapeutics targeting MPNs.",

        "Title": "Evaluating the effects of cutoffs and treatment of long-range electrostatics in protein folding simulations.",
        "Abstract": "The use of molecular dynamics simulations to provide atomic-level descriptions of biological processes tends to be computationally demanding, and a number of approximations are thus commonly employed to improve computational efficiency. In the past, the effect of these approximations on macromolecular structure and stability has been evaluated mostly through quantitative studies of small-molecule systems or qualitative observations of short-timescale simulations of biological macromolecules. Here we present a quantitative evaluation of two commonly employed approximations, using a test system that has been the subject of a number of previous protein folding studies--the villin headpiece. In particular, we examined the effect of (i) the use of a cutoff-based force-shifting technique rather than an Ewald summation for the treatment of electrostatic interactions, and (ii) the length of the cutoff used to determine how many pairwise interactions are included in the calculation of both electrostatic and van der Waals forces. Our results show that the free energy of folding is relatively insensitive to the choice of cutoff beyond 9 \u00c5, and to whether an Ewald method is used to account for long-range electrostatic interactions. In contrast, we find that the structural properties of the unfolded state depend more strongly on the two approximations examined here.",

        "Abstract": "Members of the RAS small GTPase family regulate cellular responses to extracellular stimuli by mediating the flux through downstream signal transduction cascades. RAS activity is strongly dependent on its subcellular localization and its nucleotide-binding status, both of which are modulated by posttranslational modification. We have determined that RAS is posttranslationally acetylated on lysine 104. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that this modification affects the conformational stability of the Switch II domain, which is critical for the ability of RAS to interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Consistent with this model, an acetylation-mimetic mutation in K-RAS4B suppressed guanine nucleotide exchange factor-induced nucleotide exchange and inhibited in vitro transforming activity. These data suggest that lysine acetylation is a negative regulatory modification on RAS. Because mutations in RAS family members are extremely common in cancer, modulation of RAS acetylation may constitute a therapeutic approach.",

        "Abstract": "The mutation and overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are associated with the development of a variety of cancers, making this prototypical dimerization-activated receptor tyrosine kinase a prominent target of cancer drugs. Using long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations, we find that the N lobe dimerization interface of the wild-type EGFR kinase domain is intrinsically disordered and that it becomes ordered only upon dimerization. Our simulations suggest, moreover, that some cancer-linked mutations distal to the dimerization interface, particularly the widespread L834R mutation (also referred to as L858R), facilitate EGFR dimerization by suppressing this local disorder. Corroborating these findings, our biophysical experiments and kinase enzymatic assays indicate that the L834R mutation causes abnormally high activity primarily by promoting EGFR dimerization rather than by allowing activation without dimerization. We also find that phosphorylation of EGFR kinase domain at Tyr845 may suppress the intrinsic disorder, suggesting a molecular mechanism for autonomous EGFR signaling.",

        "Abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations capture the behavior of biological macromolecules in full atomic detail, but their computational demands, combined with the challenge of appropriately modeling the relevant physics, have historically restricted their length and accuracy. Dramatic recent improvements in achievable simulation speed and the underlying physical models have enabled atomic-level simulations on timescales as long as milliseconds that capture key biochemical processes such as protein folding, drug binding, membrane transport, and the conformational changes critical to protein function. Such simulation may serve as a computational microscope, revealing biomolecular mechanisms at spatial and temporal scales that are difficult to observe experimentally. We describe the rapidly evolving state of the art for atomic-level biomolecular simulation, illustrate the types of biological discoveries that can now be made through simulation, and discuss challenges motivating continued innovation in this field.",

        "Title": "Refinement of protein structure homology models via long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.",
        "Abstract": "Accurate computational prediction of protein structure represents a longstanding challenge in molecular biology and structure-based drug design. Although homology modeling techniques are widely used to produce low-resolution models, refining these models to high resolution has proven difficult. With long enough simulations and sufficiently accurate force fields, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations should in principle allow such refinement, but efforts to refine homology models using MD have for the most part yielded disappointing results. It has thus far been unclear whether MD-based refinement is limited primarily by accessible simulation timescales, force field accuracy, or both. Here, we examine MD as a technique for homology model refinement using all-atom simulations, each at least 100 \u03bcs long-more than 100 times longer than previous refinement simulations-and a physics-based force field that was recently shown to successfully fold a structurally diverse set of fast-folding proteins. In MD simulations of 24 proteins chosen from the refinement category of recent Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments, we find that in most cases, simulations initiated from homology models drift away from the native structure. Comparison with simulations initiated from the native structure suggests that force field accuracy is the primary factor limiting MD-based refinement. This problem can be mitigated to some extent by restricting sampling to the neighborhood of the initial model, leading to structural improvement that, while limited, is roughly comparable to the leading alternative methods.",

        "Abstract": "The mechanism of ion channel voltage gating-how channels open and close in response to voltage changes-has been debated since Hodgkin and Huxley's seminal discovery that the crux of nerve conduction is ion flow across cellular membranes. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show how a voltage-gated potassium channel (KV) switches between activated and deactivated states. On deactivation, pore hydrophobic collapse rapidly halts ion flow. Subsequent voltage-sensing domain (VSD) relaxation, including inward, 15-angstrom S4-helix motion, completes the transition. On activation, outward S4 motion tightens the VSD-pore linker, perturbing linker-S6-helix packing. Fluctuations allow water, then potassium ions, to reenter the pore; linker-S6 repacking stabilizes the open pore. We propose a mechanistic model for the sodium/potassium/calcium voltage-gated ion channel superfamily that reconciles apparently conflicting experimental data.",

The accuracy of such simulations, however, is critically dependent on the force field--the mathematical model used to approximate the atomic-level forces acting on the simulated molecular system. Here we present a systematic and extensive evaluation of eight different protein force fields based on comparisons of experimental data with molecular dynamics simulations that reach a previously inaccessible timescale. First, through extensive comparisons with experimental NMR data, we examined the force fields' abilities to describe the structure and fluctuations of folded proteins. Second, we quantified potential biases towards different secondary structure types by comparing experimental and simulation data for small peptides that preferentially populate either helical or sheet-like structures. Third, we tested the force fields' abilities to fold two small proteins--one \u03b1-helical, the other with \u03b2-sheet structure. The results suggest that force fields have improved over time, and that the most recent versions, while not perfect, provide an accurate description of many structural and dynamical properties of proteins.",

        "Title": "Structure and dynamics of the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor.",
        "Abstract": "Acetylcholine, the first neurotransmitter to be identified, exerts many of its physiological actions via activation of a family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) known as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). Although the five mAChR subtypes (M1-M5) share a high degree of sequence homology, they show pronounced differences in G-protein coupling preference and the physiological responses they mediate. Unfortunately, despite decades of effort, no therapeutic agents endowed with clear mAChR subtype selectivity have been developed to exploit these differences. We describe here the structure of the G(q/11)-coupled M3 mAChR ('M3 receptor', from rat) bound to the bronchodilator drug tiotropium and identify the binding mode for this clinically important drug. This structure, together with that of the G(i/o)-coupled M2 receptor, offers possibilities for the design of mAChR subtype-selective ligands. Importantly, the M3 receptor structure allows a structural comparison between two members of a mammalian GPCR subfamily displaying different G-protein coupling selectivities. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that tiotropium binds transiently to an allosteric site en route to the binding pocket of both receptors. These simulations offer a structural view of an allosteric binding mode for an orthosteric GPCR ligand and provide additional opportunities for the design of ligands with different affinities or binding kinetics for different mAChR subtypes. Our findings not only offer insights into the structure and function of one of the most important GPCR families, but may also facilitate the design of improved therapeutics targeting these critical receptors.",

        "Abstract": "The accurate characterization of the structure and dynamics of proteins in disordered states is a difficult problem at the frontier of structural biology whose solution promises to further our understanding of protein folding and intrinsically disordered proteins. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have added considerably to our understanding of folded proteins, but the accuracy with which the force fields used in such simulations can describe disordered proteins is unclear. In this work, using a modern force field, we performed a 200 \u03bcs unrestrained MD simulation of the acid-unfolded state of an experimentally well-characterized protein, ACBP, to explore the extent to which state-of-the-art simulation can describe the structural and dynamical features of a disordered protein. By comparing the simulation results with the results of NMR experiments, we demonstrate that the simulation successfully captures important aspects of both the local and global structure. Our simulation was ~2 orders of magnitude longer than those in previous studies of unfolded proteins, a length sufficient to observe repeated formation and breaking of helical structure, which we found to occur on a multimicrosecond time scale. We observed one structural feature that formed but did not break during the simulation, highlighting the difficulty in sampling disordered states. Overall, however, our simulation results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data, demonstrating that MD simulations can already be useful in describing disordered proteins. Finally, our direct calculation of certain NMR observables from the simulation provides new insight into the general relationship between structural features of disordered proteins and experimental NMR relaxation properties.",

        "Abstract": "Molecular simulations aim to sample all of the thermodynamically important states; when the sampling is inadequate, inaccuracy follows. A widely used technique to enhance sampling in simulations is Hamiltonian exchange. This technique introduces auxiliary Hamiltonians under which sampling is computationally efficient and attempts to exchange the molecular states among the auxiliary and the original Hamiltonians. The effectiveness of Hamiltonian exchange depends in part on the probability that the trial exchanges can be accepted, which involves good choices of auxiliary Hamiltonians and a good method of generating the trial exchanges. In this paper, we investigate nonequilibrium simulations as trial exchange generators and develop a theoretical model for the efficiency of Hamiltonian exchange and an algorithm to better configure such simulations. We show that properly configured nonequilibrium simulations can modestly increase the overall efficiency of Hamiltonian exchange.",

Here, we report the results of atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, over periods ranging between 100 \u03bcs and 1 ms, that reveal a set of common principles underlying the folding of 12 structurally diverse proteins. In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.",

        "Abstract": "A third of marketed drugs act by binding to a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and either triggering or preventing receptor activation. Although recent crystal structures have provided snapshots of both active and inactive functional states of GPCRs, these structures do not reveal the mechanism by which GPCRs transition between these states. Here we propose an activation mechanism for the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor, a prototypical GPCR, based on atomic-level simulations in which an agonist-bound receptor transitions spontaneously from the active to the inactive crystallographically observed conformation. A loosely coupled allosteric network, comprising three regions that can each switch individually between multiple distinct conformations, links small perturbations at the extracellular drug-binding site to large conformational changes at the intracellular G-protein-binding site. Our simulations also exhibit an intermediate that may represent a receptor conformation to which a G protein binds during activation, and suggest that the first structural changes during receptor activation often take place on the intracellular side of the receptor, far from the drug-binding site. By capturing this fundamental signaling process in atomic detail, our results may provide a foundation for the design of drugs that control receptor signaling more precisely by stabilizing specific receptor conformations.",

We captured this pharmaceutically critical process in atomic detail using the first unbiased molecular dynamics simulations in which drug molecules spontaneously associate with G-protein-coupled receptors to achieve final poses matching those determined crystallographically. We found that several beta blockers and a beta agonist all traverse the same well-defined, dominant pathway as they bind to the \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptors, initially making contact with a vestibule on each receptor's extracellular surface. Surprisingly, association with this vestibule, at a distance of 15 \u00c5 from the binding pocket, often presents the largest energetic barrier to binding, despite the fact that subsequent entry into the binding pocket requires the receptor to deform and the drug to squeeze through a narrow passage. The early barrier appears to reflect the substantial dehydration that takes place as the drug associates with the vestibule. Our atomic-level description of the binding process suggests opportunities for allosteric modulation and provides a structural foundation for future optimization of drug-receptor binding and unbinding rates.",

        "Abstract": "Although the thermodynamic principles that control the binding of drug molecules to their protein targets are well understood, detailed experimental characterization of the process by which such binding occurs has proven challenging. We conducted relatively long, unguided molecular dynamics simulations in which a ligand (the cancer drug dasatinib or the kinase inhibitor PP1) was initially placed at a random location within a box that also contained a protein (Src kinase) to which that ligand was known to bind. In several of these simulations, the ligand correctly identified its target binding site, forming a complex virtually identical to the crystallographically determined bound structure. The simulated trajectories provide a continuous, atomic-level view of the entire binding process, revealing persistent and noteworthy intermediate conformations and shedding light on the role of water molecules. The technique we employed, which does not assume any prior knowledge of the binding site's location, may prove particularly useful in the development of allosteric inhibitors that target previously undiscovered binding sites.",

In each simulation, we observed a large number of transitions between the unfolded and folded states, and in all four cases, both the rate of folding and the structure of the native state were in good agreement with experiments. We found, however, that the folding mechanism and the properties of the unfolded state depend substantially on the choice of force field. We thus conclude that although it is important to match a single, experimentally determined structure and folding rate, this does not ensure that a given simulation will provide a unique and correct description of the full free-energy surface and the mechanism of folding.",

        "Title": "Structure and function of an irreversible agonist-\u03b2(2) adrenoceptor complex.",
        "Abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are eukaryotic integral membrane proteins that modulate biological function by initiating cellular signalling in response to chemically diverse agonists. Despite recent progress in the structural biology of GPCRs, the molecular basis for agonist binding and allosteric modulation of these proteins is poorly understood. Structural knowledge of agonist-bound states is essential for deciphering the mechanism of receptor activation, and for structure-guided design and optimization of ligands. However, the crystallization of agonist-bound GPCRs has been hampered by modest affinities and rapid off-rates of available agonists. Using the inactive structure of the human \u03b2(2) adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(2)AR) as a guide, we designed a \u03b2(2)AR agonist that can be covalently tethered to a specific site on the receptor through a disulphide bond. The covalent \u03b2(2)AR-agonist complex forms efficiently, and is capable of activating a heterotrimeric G protein. We crystallized a covalent agonist-bound \u03b2(2)AR-T4L fusion protein in lipid bilayers through the use of the lipidic mesophase method, and determined its structure at 3.5\u2009\u00c5 resolution. A comparison to the inactive structure and an antibody-stabilized active structure (companion paper) shows how binding events at both the extracellular and intracellular surfaces are required to stabilize an active conformation of the receptor. The structures are in agreement with long-timescale (up to 30\u2009\u03bcs) molecular dynamics simulations showing that an agonist-bound active conformation spontaneously relaxes to an inactive-like conformation in the absence of a G protein or stabilizing antibody.",

        "Abstract": "One of the most important and elusive goals of molecular biology is the formulation of a detailed, atomic-level understanding of the process of protein folding. Fast-folding proteins with low free-energy barriers have proved to be particularly productive objects of investigation in this context, but the design of fast-folding proteins was previously driven largely by experiment. Dramatic advances in the attainable length of molecular dynamics simulations have allowed us to characterize in atomic-level detail the folding mechanism of the fast-folding all-\u03b2 WW domain FiP35. In the work reported here, we applied the biophysical insights gained from these studies to computationally design an even faster-folding variant of FiP35 containing only naturally occurring amino acids. The increased stability and high folding rate predicted by our simulations were subsequently validated by temperature-jump experiments. The experimentally measured folding time was 4.3\u00a0\u03bcs at 80\u00a0\u00b0C-about three times faster than the fastest previously known protein with \u03b2-sheet content and in good agreement with our prediction. These results provide a compelling demonstration of the potential utility of very long molecular dynamics simulations in redesigning proteins well beyond their evolved stability and folding speed.",

We examined two fundamental processes in protein dynamics--protein folding and conformational change within the folded state--by means of extremely long all-atom MD simulations conducted on a special-purpose machine. Equilibrium simulations of a WW protein domain captured multiple folding and unfolding events that consistently follow a well-defined folding pathway; separate simulations of the protein's constituent substructures shed light on possible determinants of this pathway.

        "Abstract": "Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a multidomain protein that plays important roles in the growth, invasion, and metastasis of a number of cancers. In the present study, we examined the effects of administration of a monoclonal anti-uPAR antibody (ATN-658) on prostate cancer progression in vitro and in vivo. We examined the effect of treatment of ATN-658 on human prostate cancer cell invasion, migration, proliferation, and regulation of intracellular signaling pathways. For in vivo studies, PC-3 cells (1 x 10(6)) were inoculated into the right flank of male Balb C nu/nu mice through subcutaneous or through intratibial route (2 x 10(5)) of male Fox Chase severe combined immunodeficient mice to monitor the effect on tumor growth and skeletal metastasis. Treatment with ATN-658 resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease in PC-3 cell invasion and migration without affecting cell doubling time. Western blot analysis showed that ATN-658 treatment decreased the phosphorylation of serine/threonine protein kinase B (AKT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) without affecting AKT, MAPK, and FAK total protein expression. In in vivo studies, ATN-658 caused a significant decrease in tumor volume and a marked reduction in skeletal lesions as determined by Faxitron x-ray and micro-computed tomography. Immunohistochemical analysis of subcutaneous and tibial tumors showed a marked decrease in the levels of expression of pAKT, pMAPK, and pFAK, consistent with the in vitro observations. Results from these studies provide compelling evidence for the continued development of ATN-658 as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of prostate and other cancers expressing uPAR.",

        "Abstract": "Since the behavior of biomolecules can be sensitive to temperature, the ability to accurately calculate and control the temperature in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is important. Standard analysis of equilibrium MD simulations-even constant-energy simulations with negligible long-term energy drift-often yields different calculated temperatures for different motions, however, in apparent violation of the statistical mechanical principle of equipartition of energy. Although such analysis provides a valuable warning that other simulation artifacts may exist, it leaves the actual value of the temperature uncertain. We observe that Tolman's generalized equipartition theorem should hold for long stable simulations performed using velocity-Verlet or other symplectic integrators, because the simulated trajectory is thought to sample almost exactly from a continuous trajectory generated by a shadow Hamiltonian. From this we conclude that all motions should share a single simulation temperature, and we provide a new temperature estimator that we test numerically in simulations of a diatomic fluid and of a solvated protein. Apparent temperature variations between different motions observed using standard estimators do indeed disappear when using the new estimator. We use our estimator to better understand how thermostats and barostats can exacerbate integration errors. In particular, we find that with large (albeit widely used) time steps, the common practice of using two thermostats to remedy so-called hot solvent-cold solute problems can have the counterintuitive effect of causing temperature imbalances. Our results, moreover, highlight the utility of multiple-time step integrators for accurate and efficient simulation.",

Recent modifications to the Amber and CHARMM protein force fields, for example, have improved the backbone torsion potentials, remedying deficiencies in earlier versions. Here, we further advance simulation accuracy by improving the amino acid side-chain torsion potentials of the Amber ff99SB force field. First, we used simulations of model alpha-helical systems to identify the four residue types whose rotamer distribution differed the most from expectations based on Protein Data Bank statistics. Second, we optimized the side-chain torsion potentials of these residues to match new, high-level quantum-mechanical calculations. Finally, we used microsecond-timescale MD simulations in explicit solvent to validate the resulting force field against a large set of experimental NMR measurements that directly probe side-chain conformations. The new force field, which we have termed Amber ff99SB-ILDN, exhibits considerably better agreement with the NMR data.",

        "Abstract": "We present the first atomic-resolution observations of permeation and gating in a K(+) channel, based on molecular dynamics simulations of the Kv1.2 pore domain. Analysis of hundreds of simulated permeation events revealed a detailed conduction mechanism, resembling the Hodgkin-Keynes \"knock-on\" model, in which translocation of two selectivity filter-bound ions is driven by a third ion; formation of this knock-on intermediate is rate determining. In addition, at reverse or zero voltages, we observed pore closure by a novel \"hydrophobic gating\" mechanism: A dewetting transition of the hydrophobic pore cavity-fastest when K(+) was not bound in selectivity filter sites nearest the cavity-caused the open, conducting pore to collapse into a closed, nonconducting conformation. Such pore closure corroborates the idea that voltage sensors can act to prevent pore collapse into the intrinsically more stable, closed conformation, and it further suggests that molecular-scale dewetting facilitates a specific biological function: K(+) channel gating. Existing experimental data support our hypothesis that hydrophobic gating may be a fundamental principle underlying the gating of voltage-sensitive K(+) channels. We suggest that hydrophobic gating explains, in part, why diverse ion channels conserve hydrophobic pore cavities, and we speculate that modulation of cavity hydration could enable structural determination of both open and closed channels.",

        "Title": "Structural analysis of the catalytically inactive kinase domain of the human EGF receptor 3.",
        "Abstract": "The kinase domain of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 3/ErbB3, a member of the EGF receptor (EGFR) family, lacks several residues that are critical for catalysis. Because catalytic activity in EGFR family members is switched on by an allosteric interaction between kinase domains in an asymmetric kinase domain dimer, HER3 might be specialized to serve as an activator of other EGFR family members. We have determined the crystal structure of the HER3 kinase domain and show that it appears to be locked into an inactive conformation that resembles that of EGFR and HER4. Although the crystal structure shows that the HER3 kinase domain binds ATP, we confirm that it is catalytically inactive but can serve as an activator of the EGFR kinase domain. The HER3 kinase domain forms a dimer in the crystal, mediated by hydrophobic contacts between the N-terminal lobes of the kinase domains. This N-lobe dimer closely resembles a dimer formed by inactive HER4 kinase domains in crystal structures determined previously, and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the HER3 and HER4 N-lobe dimers are stable. The kinase domains of HER3 and HER4 form similar chains in their respective crystal lattices, in which N-lobe dimers are linked together by reciprocal exchange of C-terminal tails. The conservation of this tiling pattern in HER3 and HER4, which is the closest evolutionary homolog of HER3, might represent a general mechanism by which this branch of the HER receptors restricts ligand-independent formation of active heterodimers with other members of the EGFR family.",

Here, we illustrate the utility of state-of-the-art high-performance MD simulations in the study of membrane proteins, using as examples a G-protein-coupled receptor, an aquaporin, and an antiporter.

        "Abstract": "In computational thermodynamics, a sequence of intermediate states is commonly introduced to connect two equilibrium states. We consider two cases where the choice of intermediate states is particularly important: minimizing statistical error in free-energy difference calculations and maximizing average acceptance probabilities in replica-exchange simulations. We derive bounds for these quantities in terms of the thermodynamic distance between the intermediates, and show that in both cases the intermediates should be chosen as equidistant points along a geodesic connecting the end states.",

        "Title": "Automated Event Detection and Activity Monitoring in Long Molecular Dynamics Simulations.",
        "Abstract": "Events of scientific interest in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, including conformational changes, folding transitions, and translocations of ligands and reaction products, often correspond to high-level structural rearrangements that alter contacts between molecules or among different parts of a molecule. Due to advances in computer architecture and software, MD trajectories representing such structure-changing events have become easier to generate, but the length of these trajectories poses a challenge to scientific interpretation and analysis. In this paper, we present automated methods for the detection of potentially important structure-changing events in long MD trajectories. In contrast with traditional tools for the analysis of such trajectories, our methods provide a detailed report of broken and formed contacts that aids in the identification of specific time-dependent side-chain interactions. Our approach employs a coarse-grained representation of amino acid side chains, a contact metric based on higher order generalizations of Delaunay tetrahedralization, techniques for detecting significant shifts in the resulting contact time series, and a new kernel-based measure of contact alteration activity. The analysis methods we describe are incorporated in a newly developed package, called TimeScapes, which is freely available and compatible with trajectories generated by a variety of popular MD programs. Tests based on actual microsecond time scale simulations demonstrate that the package can be used to efficiently detect and characterize important conformational changes in realistic protein systems.",

        "Title": "Equally potent inhibition of c-Src and Abl by compounds that recognize inactive kinase conformations.",
        "Abstract": "Imatinib is an inhibitor of the Abl tyrosine kinase domain that is effective in the treatment of chronic myelogenic leukemia. Although imatinib binds tightly to the Abl kinase domain, its affinity for the closely related kinase domain of c-Src is at least 2,000-fold lower. Imatinib recognition requires a specific inactive conformation of the kinase domain, in which a conserved Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif is flipped with respect to the active conformation. The inability of c-Src to readily adopt this flipped DFG conformation was thought to underlie the selectivity of imatinib for Abl over c-Src. Here, we present a series of inhibitors (DSA compounds) that are based on the core scaffold of imatinib but which bind with equally high potency to c-Src and Abl. The DSA compounds bind to c-Src in the DFG-flipped conformation, as confirmed by crystal structures and kinetic analysis. The origin of the high affinity of these compounds for c-Src is suggested by the fact that they also inhibit clinically relevant Abl variants bearing mutations in a structural element, the P-loop, that normally interacts with the phosphate groups of ATP but is folded over a substructure of imatinib in Abl. Importantly, several of the DSA compounds block the growth of Ba/F3 cells harboring imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants, including the Thr315Ile \"gatekeeper\" mutation, but do not suppress the growth of parental Ba/F3 cells.",

        "Abstract": "Fully understanding the mechanisms of signaling proteins such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) will require the characterization of their conformational states and the pathways connecting those states. The recent crystal structures of the beta(2)- and beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in a nominally inactive state constituted a major advance toward this goal, but also raised new questions. Although earlier biochemical observations had suggested that these receptors possessed a set of contacts between helices 3 and 6, known as the ionic lock, which was believed to form a molecular switch for receptor activation, the crystal structures lacked these contacts. The unexpectedly broken ionic lock has raised questions about the true conformation(s) of the inactive state and the role of the ionic lock in receptor activation and signaling. To address these questions, we performed microsecond-timescale molecular dynamics simulations of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) in multiple wild-type and mutant forms. In wild-type simulations, the ionic lock formed reproducibly, bringing the intracellular ends of helices 3 and 6 together to adopt a conformation similar to that found in inactive rhodopsin. Our results suggest that inactive beta(2)AR exists in equilibrium between conformations with the lock formed and the lock broken, whether or not the cocrystallized ligand is present. These findings, along with the formation of several secondary structural elements in the beta(2)AR loops during our simulations, may provide a more comprehensive picture of the inactive state of the beta-adrenergic receptors, reconciling the crystal structures with biochemical studies.",

        "Abstract": "In many protein kinases, a characteristic conformational change (the \"DFG flip\") connects catalytically active and inactive conformations. Many kinase inhibitors--including the cancer drug imatinib--selectively target a specific DFG conformation, but the function and mechanism of the flip remain unclear. Using long molecular dynamics simulations of the Abl kinase, we visualized the DFG flip in atomic-level detail and formulated an energetic model predicting that protonation of the DFG aspartate controls the flip. Consistent with our model's predictions, we demonstrated experimentally that the kinetics of imatinib binding to Abl kinase have a pH dependence that disappears when the DFG aspartate is mutated. Our model suggests a possible explanation for the high degree of conservation of the DFG motif: that the flip, modulated by electrostatic changes inherent to the catalytic cycle, allows the kinase to access flexible conformations facilitating nucleotide binding and release.",

        "Abstract": "Aquaporin 0 (AQP0), the most abundant membrane protein in mammalian lens fiber cells, not only serves as the primary water channel in this tissue but also appears to mediate the formation of thin junctions between fiber cells. AQP0 is remarkably less water permeable than other aquaporins, but the structural basis and biological significance of this low permeability remain uncertain, as does the permeability of the protein in a reported junctional form. To address these issues, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of water transport through membrane-embedded AQP0 in both its (octameric) junctional and (tetrameric) nonjunctional forms. From our simulations, we measured an osmotic permeability for the nonjunctional form that agrees with experiment and found that the distinct dynamics of the conserved, lumen-protruding side chains of Tyr-23 and Tyr-149 modulate water passage, accounting for the slow permeation. The junctional and nonjunctional forms conducted water equivalently, in contrast to a previous suggestion based on static crystal structures that water conduction is lost on junction formation. Our analysis suggests that the low water permeability of AQP0 may help maintain the mechanical stability of the junction. We hypothesize that the structural features leading to low permeability may have evolved in part to allow AQP0 to form junctions that both conduct water and contribute to the organizational structure of the fiber cell tissue and microcirculation within it, as required to maintain transparency of the lens.",

        "Abstract": "Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is an abundant copper/zinc enzyme found in the cytoplasm that converts superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. Tetrathiomolybdate (ATN-224) has been recently identified as an inhibitor of SOD1 that attenuates FGF-2- and VEGF-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in endothelial cells. However, the mechanism for this inhibition was not elucidated. Growth factor (GF) signaling elicits an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which inactivates protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) by oxidizing an essential cysteine residue in the active site. ATN-224-mediated inhibition of SOD1 in tumor and endothelial cells prevents the formation of sufficiently high levels of H(2)O(2), resulting in the protection of PTPs from H(2)O(2)-mediated oxidation. This, in turn, leads to the inhibition of EGF-, IGF-1-, and FGF-2-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Pretreatment with exogenous H(2)O(2) or with the phosphatase inhibitor vanadate abrogates the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by ATN-224 or SOD1 siRNA treatments. Furthermore, ATN-224-mediated SOD1 inhibition causes the down-regulation of the PDGF receptor. SOD1 inhibition also increases the steady-state levels of superoxide, which induces protein oxidation in A431 cells but, surprisingly, does not oxidize phosphatases. Thus, SOD1 inhibition in A431 tumor cells results in both prooxidant effects caused by the increase in the levels of superoxide and antioxidant effects caused by lowering the levels of H(2)O(2). These results identify SOD1 as a master regulator of GF signaling and as a therapeutic target for the inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth.",

        "Abstract": "A molecular-level understanding of the function of a protein requires knowledge of both its structural and dynamic properties. NMR spectroscopy allows the measurement of generalized order parameters that provide an atomistic description of picosecond and nanosecond fluctuations in protein structure. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a complementary approach to the study of protein dynamics on similar time scales. Comparisons between NMR spectroscopy and MD simulations can be used to interpret experimental results and to improve the quality of simulation-related force fields and integration methods. However, apparent systematic discrepancies between order parameters extracted from simulations and experiments are common, particularly for elements of noncanonical secondary structure. In this paper, results from a 1.2 micros explicit solvent MD simulation of the protein ubiquitin are compared with previously determined backbone order parameters derived from NMR relaxation experiments [Tjandra, N.; Feller, S. E.; Pastor, R. W.; Bax, A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 12562-12566]. The simulation reveals fluctuations in three loop regions that occur on time scales comparable to or longer than that of the overall rotational diffusion of ubiquitin and whose effects would not be apparent in experimentally derived order parameters. A coupled analysis of internal and overall motion yields simulated order parameters substantially closer to the experimentally determined values than is the case for a conventional analysis of internal motion alone. Improved agreement between simulation and experiment also is encouraging from the viewpoint of assessing the accuracy of long MD simulations.",

        "Abstract": "Na+/H+ antiporters are central to cellular salt and pH homeostasis. The structure of Escherichia coli NhaA was recently determined, but its mechanisms of transport and pH regulation remain elusive. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of NhaA that, with existing experimental data, enabled us to propose an atomically detailed model of antiporter function. Three conserved aspartates are key to our proposed mechanism: Asp164 (D164) is the Na+-binding site, D163 controls the alternating accessibility of this binding site to the cytoplasm or periplasm, and D133 is crucial for pH regulation. Consistent with experimental stoichiometry, two protons are required to transport a single Na+ ion: D163 protonates to reveal the Na+-binding site to the periplasm, and subsequent protonation of D164 releases Na+. Additional mutagenesis experiments further validated the model.",

Thymidine phosphorylase has been implicated in angiogenesis and plays a significant role in tumor progression and metastasis. The presence and orientation of the phosphonate moiety (acting as a phosphate mimic) in these derivatives were critical for inhibitory activity. The most active compounds possessed a phosphonate group in an endo orientation. This was consistent with molecular modeling results that showed the endo isomer protein-ligand complex to be lower in energy than the exo complex.",

        "Abstract": "Human urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR/CD87) is expressed at the invasive interface of the tumor-stromal microenvironment in many human cancers and interacts with a wide array of extracellular molecules. An anti-uPAR antibody (ATN615) was prepared using hybridoma technology. This antibody binds to uPAR in vitro with high affinity (K(d) approximately 1 nM) and does not interfere with uPA binding to uPAR. Here we report the crystal structure of the Fab fragment of ATN615 at 1.77 A and the analysis of ATN615-suPAR-ATF structure that was previously determined, emphasizing the ATN615-suPAR interaction. The complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of ATN615 consist of a high percentage of aromatic residues, and form a relatively flat and undulating surface. The ATN615 Fab fragment recognizes domain 3 of suPAR. The antibody-antigen recognition involves 11 suPAR residues and 12 Fab residues from five CDRs. Structural data suggest that Pro188, Asn190, Gly191, and Arg192 residues of uPAR are the key residues for the antibody recognition, while Pro189 and Arg192 render specificity of ATN615 for human uPAR. Interestingly, this antibody-antigen interface has a small contact area, mainly polar interaction with little hydrophobic character, yet has high binding strength. Furthermore, several solvent molecules (assigned as polyethylene glycols) were clearly visible in the binding interface between antibody and antigen, suggesting that solvent molecules may be important for the maximal binding between suPAR and ATN615 Fab. ATN615 undergoes small but noticeable changes in its CDR region upon antigen binding.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies indicate that binding of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) to its high-affinity receptor (uPAR) orchestrates uPAR interactions with other cellular components that play a pivotal role in diverse (patho-)physiological processes, including wound healing, angiogenesis, inflammation, and cancer metastasis. However, notwithstanding the wealth of biochemical data available describing the activities of uPAR, little is known about the exact mode of uPAR/uPA interactions or the presumed conformational changes that accompany uPA/uPAR engagement. Here, we report the crystal structure of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), which contains the three domains of the wild-type receptor but lacks the cell-surface anchoring sequence, in complex with the amino-terminal fragment of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (ATF), at the resolution of 2.8 A. We report the 1.9 A crystal structure of free ATF. Our results provide a structural basis, represented by conformational changes induced in uPAR, for several published biochemical observations describing the nature of uPAR/uPA interactions and provide insight into mechanisms that may be responsible for the cellular responses induced by uPA binding.",

        "Abstract": "The evaluation of interactions between nearby particles constitutes the majority of the computational workload involved in classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this paper, we introduce a new method for the parallelization of range-limited particle interactions that proves particularly suitable to MD applications. Because it applies not only to pairwise interactions but also to interactions involving three or more particles, the method can be used for evaluation of both nonbonded and bonded forces in a MD simulation. It requires less interprocessor data transfer than traditional spatial decomposition methods at all but the lowest levels of parallelism. It gains an additional practical advantage in certain commonly used interprocessor communication networks by distributing the communication burden more evenly across network links and by decreasing the associated latency. When used to parallelize MD, it further reduces communication requirements by allowing the computations associated with short-range nonbonded interactions, long-range electrostatics, bonded interactions, and particle migration to use much of the same communicated data. We also introduce certain variants of this method that can significantly improve the balance of computational load across processors.",

        "Abstract": "High molecular weight kininogen (HK) is an abundant, multi-domain plasma protein that circulates in plasma primarily in its single chain form. Proteolytic cleavage of HK by plasma kallikrein releases the vasoactive nanopeptide bradykinin (BK), and converts HK into two-chain HK (HKa). BK appears to have pro-angiogenic activity, most likely mediated through binding to B1 and B2 receptors on endothelial cells. Conversely, HKa and its domain 5, but not (single chain) HK, have potent anti-angiogenic activity comparable to other endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors. The mechanism by which HKa exerts its anti-angiogenic activity remains controversial, but appears to involve binding to cell surface tropomyosin and induction of apoptosis of proliferating endothelial cells. A role for tropomyosin in mediating the anti-angiogenic signals of other anti-angiogenic proteins such as endostatin and histidine-proline-rich glycoprotein (HPRG) has also been reported. Here we review the physiological importance of high molecular weight kininogen in angiogenesis, with emphasis on the mechanism(s) by which this activity is mediated.",

        "Abstract": "Classical molecular dynamics simulations of biological macromolecules in explicitly modeled solvent typically require the evaluation of interactions between all pairs of atoms separated by no more than some distance R, with more distant interactions handled using some less expensive method. Performing such simulations for periods on the order of a millisecond is likely to require the use of massive parallelism. The extent to which such simulations can be efficiently parallelized, however, has historically been limited by the time required for interprocessor communication. This article introduces a new method for the parallel evaluation of distance-limited pairwise particle interactions that significantly reduces the amount of data transferred between processors by comparison with traditional methods. Specifically, the amount of data transferred into and out of a given processor scales as O(R(3/2)p(-1/2)), where p is the number of processors, and with constant factors that should yield a substantial performance advantage in practice.",

        "Abstract": "Gaussian split Ewald (GSE) is a versatile Ewald mesh method that is fast and accurate when used with both real-space and k-space Poisson solvers. While real-space methods are known to be asymptotically superior to k-space methods in terms of both computational cost and parallelization efficiency, k-space methods such as smooth particle-mesh Ewald (SPME) have thus far remained dominant because they have been more efficient than existing real-space methods for simulations of typical systems in the size range of current practical interest. Real-space GSE, however, is approximately a factor of 2 faster than previously described real-space Ewald methods for the level of force accuracy typically required in biomolecular simulations, and is competitive with leading k-space methods even for systems of moderate size. Alternatively, GSE may be combined with a k-space Poisson solver, providing a conveniently tunable k-space method that performs comparably to SPME. The GSE method follows naturally from a uniform framework that we introduce to concisely describe the differences between existing Ewald mesh methods.",

        "Abstract": "Angiogenesis is characterized by the development of new vasculature from pre-existing vessels and plays a central role in physiological processes such as embryogenesis, wound healing and female reproductive function, as well as pathophysiologic events including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetic retinopathy. The growth and metastasis of tumors is critically dependent upon angiogenesis. Although targeting angiogenesis as a therapeutic strategy has to date met with limited success in the clinic, the recent FDA approval of the anti-VEGF antibody Avastin has validated the use of anti-angiogenic therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. We have recently identified several plasma proteins having anti-angiogenic properties, including Histidine-Proline-Rich Glycoprotein (HPRG) and activated high-molecular-weight kininogen (HKa). Both of these proteins are able to induce apoptosis in endothelial cells in vitro and can inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. Recent studies from our laboratories have also identified a novel cell-surface binding protein for HKa that mediates its anti-angiogenic activity. This protein, tropomyosin, is normally found inside the cell and is associated with the actin cytoskeleton, where it plays a critical role in stabilizing actin filaments in a variety of cell types. However, in angiogenic endothelial cells, tropomyosin appears to have extracellular localization. Previous studies have also suggested the involvement of tropomyosin in the anti-angiogenic activity of endostatin, and our recent work indicates that tropomyosin may mediate the antiangiogenic activity of HPRG as well. In this review, we summarize data describing extracellular tropomyosin as a novel receptor for multiple anti-angiogenic proteins. Extracellular tropomyosin may therefore represent a previously undescribed central target for the development of anti-angiogenic therapy.",

        "Abstract": "The antiangiogenic activity of the multidomain plasma protein histidine-proline-rich glycoprotein (HPRG) is localized to its histidine-proline-rich (H/P) domain and has recently been shown to be mediated, at least partially, through binding to cell-surface tropomyosin in fibroblast growth factor-2-activated endothelial cells (X. Guan et al., Thromb Haemost, in press). HPRG and its H/P domain, but not the other domains of HPRG, bind specifically and with high affinity to tropomyosin. In this study, we characterize the interaction of the H/P domain with tropomyosin and delineate the region within the H/P domain responsible for that interaction. The H/P domain of HPRG consists mostly of repetitions of the consensus sequence [H/P][H/P]PHG. Applying an in vitro tropomyosin binding assay, we demonstrate that the synthetic peptide HHPHG binds to tropomyosin in vitro and inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. The affinity for tropomyosin increases exponentially upon multimerization of the HHPHG sequence, with a concurrent increase in antiangiogenic activity. Specifically, the tetramer (HHPHG)4 has significant antiangiogenic activity in the Matrigel plug model (IC50 approximately 600 nm) and antitumor effects in two syngeneic mouse tumor models. Thus, we show that a 16-mer peptide analogue mimics the antiangiogenic activity of intact HPRG and is also able to inhibit tumor growth, suggesting that cell surface tropomyosin may represent a novel antiangiogenic target for the treatment of cancer.",

        "Abstract": "The anti-angiogenic properties of the histidine-proline-rich (H/P) domain of HPRG have recently been described (Juarez JC, et al. Cancer Research 2002; 62: 5344-50). However, the binding site that mediates these properties is unknown. HPRG is evolutionarily, functionally and structurally related to cleaved high molecular weight kininogen (HKa), an anti-angiogenic polypeptide that stimulates apoptosis of proliferating endothelial cells through binding to cell-surface tropomyosin (Zhang J-C, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2002; 99: 12224-9). In this study, we demonstrate that HPRG binds with high affinity to FGF-2-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and immobilized tropomyosin in a Zn2+ or pH-dependent manner, and that this interaction is mediated by the H/P domain of HPRG. At least two binding sites for HPRG, tropomyosin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPs), were identified on the surface of FGF-2-activated endothelial cells. Translocation of tropomyosin to the surface of HUVEC occurred in response to FGF-2, and the anti-angiogenic activity of HPRG in a Matrigel plug model was partially inhibited by soluble tropomyosin. These results suggest that HPRG binds to endothelial cell surface tropomyosin which at least partially mediates the antiangiogenic effects of HPRG.",

        "Title": "A hierarchical approach to all-atom protein loop prediction.",
        "Abstract": "The application of all-atom force fields (and explicit or implicit solvent models) to protein homology-modeling tasks such as side-chain and loop prediction remains challenging both because of the expense of the individual energy calculations and because of the difficulty of sampling the rugged all-atom energy surface. Here we address this challenge for the problem of loop prediction through the development of numerous new algorithms, with an emphasis on multiscale and hierarchical techniques. As a first step in evaluating the performance of our loop prediction algorithm, we have applied it to the problem of reconstructing loops in native structures; we also explicitly include crystal packing to provide a fair comparison with crystal structures. In brief, large numbers of loops are generated by using a dihedral angle-based buildup procedure followed by iterative cycles of clustering, side-chain optimization, and complete energy minimization of selected loop structures. We evaluate this method by using the largest test set yet used for validation of a loop prediction method, with a total of 833 loops ranging from 4 to 12 residues in length. Average/median backbone root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) to the native structures (superimposing the body of the protein, not the loop itself) are 0.42/0.24 A for 5 residue loops, 1.00/0.44 A for 8 residue loops, and 2.47/1.83 A for 11 residue loops. Median RMSDs are substantially lower than the averages because of a small number of outliers; the causes of these failures are examined in some detail, and many can be attributed to errors in assignment of protonation states of titratable residues, omission of ligands from the simulation, and, in a few cases, probable errors in the experimentally determined structures. When these obvious problems in the data sets are filtered out, average RMSDs to the native structures improve to 0.43 A for 5 residue loops, 0.84 A for 8 residue loops, and 1.63 A for 11 residue loops. In the vast majority of cases, the method locates energy minima that are lower than or equal to that of the minimized native loop, thus indicating that sampling rarely limits prediction accuracy. The overall results are, to our knowledge, the best reported to date, and we attribute this success to the combination of an accurate all-atom energy function, efficient methods for loop buildup and side-chain optimization, and, especially for the longer loops, the hierarchical refinement protocol.",

        "Title": "Glide: a new approach for rapid, accurate docking and scoring. 1. Method and assessment of docking accuracy.",
        "Abstract": "Unlike other methods for docking ligands to the rigid 3D structure of a known protein receptor, Glide approximates a complete systematic search of the conformational, orientational, and positional space of the docked ligand. In this search, an initial rough positioning and scoring phase that dramatically narrows the search space is followed by torsionally flexible energy optimization on an OPLS-AA nonbonded potential grid for a few hundred surviving candidate poses. The very best candidates are further refined via a Monte Carlo sampling of pose conformation; in some cases, this is crucial to obtaining an accurate docked pose. Selection of the best docked pose uses a model energy function that combines empirical and force-field-based terms. Docking accuracy is assessed by redocking ligands from 282 cocrystallized PDB complexes starting from conformationally optimized ligand geometries that bear no memory of the correctly docked pose. Errors in geometry for the top-ranked pose are less than 1 A in nearly half of the cases and are greater than 2 A in only about one-third of them. Comparisons to published data on rms deviations show that Glide is nearly twice as accurate as GOLD and more than twice as accurate as FlexX for ligands having up to 20 rotatable bonds. Glide is also found to be more accurate than the recently described Surflex method.",

        "Title": "Histidine-proline-rich glycoprotein has potent antiangiogenic activity mediated through the histidine-proline-rich domain.",
        "Abstract": "Histidine-proline-rich glycoprotein (HPRG) is an abundant multidomain plasma protein evolutionarily related to high-molecular-weight kininogen. The cleaved form of high-molecular-weight kininogen has recently been demonstrated to exhibit antiangiogenic activities in vitro (J. C. Zhang et al., FASEB J., 14: 2589-2600, 2000), mediated primarily through domain 5. HPRG contains a histidine-proline-rich (H/P) domain with sequence and functional similarities to HKa-D5. We hypothesized that HPRG may also have antiangiogenic properties, localized within its H/P domain. The H/P domain is highly conserved among species, and because rabbit H/P domain is more resistant to internal proteolytic cleavage than the human domain, the rabbit HPRG (rbHPRG) was primarily used to assess the antiangiogenic activity of HPRG. Rabbit HPRG inhibited human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation stimulated by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) or vascular endothelial growth factor on a Matrigel surface as well as cell proliferation of FGF-2 stimulated HUVECs. The antiangiogenic activity of rbHPRG was localized to the H/P domain by use of proteolytic fragments of rbHPRG and was further confirmed and characterized in two in vivo models of angiogenesis: the chorioallantoic membrane of the chick assay and the mouse Matrigel plug assay. Caspase-3 activation was observed in HUVECs stimulated with FGF-2 in the presence of rbHPRG, suggesting that apoptosis of activated endothelial cells may be one of the mechanisms underlying its antiangiogenic activity. Finally, the H/P domain of rbHPRG reduced tumor cell number when tumor cells were co-inoculated in the Matrigel plug assay. In conclusion, the H/P domain within HPRG induces the apoptosis of activated endothelial cells leading to potent antiangiogenic effects.",
