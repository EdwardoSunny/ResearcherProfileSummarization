        "Abstract": "While precision medicine applications of radiomics analysis are promising, differences in image acquisition can cause \"batch effects\" that reduce reproducibility and affect downstream predictive analyses. Harmonization methods such as ComBat have been developed to correct these effects, but evaluation methods for quantifying batch effects are inconsistent. In this study, we propose the use of the multivariate statistical test PERMANOVA and the Robust Effect Size Index (RESI) to better quantify and characterize batch effects in radiomics data. We evaluate these methods in both simulated and real radiomics features extracted from full-field digital mammography (FFDM) data. PERMANOVA demonstrated higher power than standard univariate statistical testing, and RESI was able to interpretably quantify the effect size of site at extremely large sample sizes. These methods show promise as more powerful and interpretable methods for the detection and quantification of batch effects in radiomics studies.",

While powerful, these technologies suffer from a number of sources of variability that currently impede clinical translation. In order to overcome this impediment, there is a need to control for these sources of variability through harmonization of imaging data acquisition across institutions, construction of standardized imaging protocols that maximize the acquisition of these features, harmonization of post-processing techniques, and big data resources to properly power studies for hypothesis testing. For this to be accomplished, it will be critical to have multidisciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration.",

        "Abstract": "The field of dermatology is experiencing the rapid deployment of artificial intelligence (AI), from mobile applications (apps) for skin cancer detection to large language models like ChatGPT that can answer generalist or specialist questions about skin diagnoses. With these new applications, ethical concerns have emerged. In this scoping review, we aimed to identify the applications of AI to the field of dermatology and to understand their ethical implications. We used a multifaceted search approach, searching PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar for primary literature, following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews guidance. Our advanced query included terms related to dermatology, AI and ethical considerations. Our search yielded 202 papers. After initial screening, 68 studies were included. Thirty-two were related to clinical image analysis and raised ethical concerns for misdiagnosis, data security, privacy violations and replacement of dermatologist jobs. Seventeen discussed limited skin of colour representation in datasets leading to potential misdiagnosis in the general population. Nine articles about teledermatology raised ethical concerns, including the exacerbation of health disparities, lack of standardized regulations, informed consent for AI use and privacy challenges. Seven addressed inaccuracies in the responses of large language models. Seven examined attitudes toward and trust in AI, with most patients requesting supplemental assessment by a physician to ensure reliability and accountability. Benefits of AI integration into clinical practice include increased patient access, improved clinical decision-making, efficiency and many others. However, safeguards must be put in place to ensure the ethical application of AI.",

        "Title": "Breast Multiparametric MRI for Prediction of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Response in Breast Cancer: The BMMR2 Challenge.",
        "Abstract": "Purpose To describe the design, conduct, and results of the Breast Multiparametric MRI for prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy Response (BMMR2) challenge. Materials and Methods The BMMR2 computational challenge opened on May 28, 2021, and closed on December 21, 2021. The goal of the challenge was to identify image-based markers derived from multiparametric breast MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, along with clinical data for predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant treatment. Data included 573 breast MRI studies from 191 women (mean age [\u00b1SD], 48.9 years \u00b1 10.56) in the I-SPY 2/American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) 6698 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01042379). The challenge cohort was split into training (60%) and test (40%) sets, with teams blinded to test set pCR outcomes. Prediction performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared with the benchmark established from the ACRIN 6698 primary analysis. Results Eight teams submitted final predictions. Entries from three teams had point estimators of AUC that were higher than the benchmark performance (AUC, 0.782 [95% CI: 0.670, 0.893], with AUCs of 0.803 [95% CI: 0.702, 0.904], 0.838 [95% CI: 0.748, 0.928], and 0.840 [95% CI: 0.748, 0.932]). A variety of approaches were used, ranging from extraction of individual features to deep learning and artificial intelligence methods, incorporating DCE and DWI alone or in combination. Conclusion The BMMR2 challenge identified several models with high predictive performance, which may further expand the value of multiparametric breast MRI as an early marker of treatment response. Clinical trial registration no. NCT01042379 ",

        "Abstract": "Background Background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) at breast MRI has been associated with increased breast cancer risk in several independent studies. However, variability of subjective BPE assessments have precluded its use in clinical practice. Purpose To examine the association between fully objective measures of BPE at MRI and odds of breast cancer. Materials and Methods This prospective case-control study included patients who underwent a bilateral breast MRI examination and were receiving care at one of three centers in the United States from November 2010 to July 2017. Breast volume, fibroglandular tissue (FGT) volume, and BPE were quantified using fully automated software. Fat volume was defined as breast volume minus FGT volume. BPE extent was defined as the proportion of FGT voxels with enhancement of 20% or more. Spearman rank correlation between quantitative BPE extent and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) BPE categories assigned by an experienced board-certified breast radiologist was estimated. With use of multivariable logistic regression, breast cancer case-control status was regressed on tertiles (low, moderate, and high) of BPE, FGT volume, and fat volume, with adjustment for covariates. Results In total, 536 case participants with breast cancer (median age, 48 years [IQR, 43-55 years]) and 940 cancer-free controls (median age, 46 years [IQR, 38-55 years]) were included. BPE extent was positively associated with BI-RADS BPE (",

Fully automated quantitative density assessment methods have recently been developed that could facilitate large-scale studies, although data on associations with long-term breast cancer risk are limited. We examined LIBRA assessments and breast cancer risk and compared results to prior assessments using Cumulus, an established computer-assisted method requiring manual thresholding.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose To investigate the impact of longitudinal variation in functional tumor volume (FTV) underestimation and overestimation in predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials and Methods Women with breast cancer who were enrolled in the prospective I-SPY 2 TRIAL (Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging and Molecular Analysis 2) from May 2010 to November 2016 were eligible for this retrospective analysis. Participants underwent four MRI examinations during NAC treatment. FTV was calculated based on automated segmentation. Baseline FTV before treatment (FTV0) and the percentage of FTV change at early treatment and inter-regimen time points relative to baseline (\u2206FTV1 and \u2206FTV2, respectively) were classified into high-standard or standard groups based on visual assessment of FTV under- and overestimation. Logistic regression models predicting pCR using single predictors (FTV0, \u2206FTV1, and \u2206FTV2) and multiple predictors (all three) were developed using bootstrap resampling with out-of-sample data evaluation with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) independently in each group. Results This study included 432 women (mean age, 49.0 years \u00b1 10.6 [SD]). In the FTV0 model, the high-standard and standard groups showed similar AUCs (0.61 vs 0.62). The high-standard group had a higher estimated AUC compared with the standard group in the \u2206FTV1 (0.74 vs 0.63), \u2206FTV2 (0.79 vs 0.62), and multiple predictor models (0.85 vs 0.64), with a statistically significant difference for the latter two models (",

Understanding genetic factors associated with breast density may help in clarifying mechanisms by which breast density increases cancer risk. To date, 50 genetic loci have been associated with breast density, however, these studies were performed among predominantly European ancestry populations. We utilized a cohort of women aged 40-85 years who underwent screening mammography and had genetic information available from the Penn Medicine BioBank to conduct a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of breast density among 1323 women of African ancestry. For each mammogram, the publicly available \"LIBRA\" software was used to quantify dense area and area percent density. We identified 34 significant loci associated with dense area and area percent density, with the strongest signals in ",

We assessed discrimination and calibration of models consisting of the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT), Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System density and quantitative density measures. Patients were followed up from the date of first screening mammogram until invasive breast cancer diagnosis or 5-year follow-up. Areas under the curve for White women stayed consistently around 0.59 for all models, whereas the area under the curve increased slightly from 0.60 to 0.62 when adding dense area and area percent density to the BCRAT model for Black women. All women saw underprediction in all models, with Black women having less underprediction. Adding quantitative density to the BCRAT did not statistically significantly improve prediction for White or Black women. Future studies should evaluate whether volumetric breast density improves risk prediction.",

        "Abstract": "Breast cancer risk is highly variable within the population and current research is leading the shift toward personalized medicine. By accurately assessing an individual woman's risk, we can reduce the risk of over/undertreatment by preventing unnecessary procedures or by elevating screening procedures. Breast density measured from conventional mammography has been established as one of the most dominant risk factors for breast cancer; however, it is currently limited by its ability to characterize more complex breast parenchymal patterns that have been shown to provide additional information to strengthen cancer risk models. Molecular factors ranging from high penetrance, or high likelihood that a mutation will show signs and symptoms of the disease, to combinations of gene mutations with low penetrance have shown promise for augmenting risk assessment. Although imaging biomarkers and molecular biomarkers have both individually demonstrated improved performance in risk assessment, few studies have evaluated them together. This review aims to highlight the current state of the art in breast cancer risk assessment using imaging and genetic biomarkers.",

        "Abstract": "In modern clinical decision-support algorithms, heterogeneity in image characteristics due to variations in imaging systems and protocols hinders the development of reproducible quantitative measures including for feature extraction pipelines. With the help of a reader study, we investigate the ability to provide consistent ground-truth targets by using patient-specific 3D-printed lung phantoms. PixelPrint was developed for 3D-printing lifelike computed tomography (CT) lung phantoms by directly translating clinical images into printer instructions that control density on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Data sets of three COVID-19 patients served as input for 3D-printing lung phantoms. Five radiologists rated patient and phantom images for imaging characteristics and diagnostic confidence in a blinded reader study. Effect sizes of evaluating phantom as opposed to patient images were assessed using linear mixed models. Finally, PixelPrint's production reproducibility was evaluated. Images of patients and phantoms had little variation in the estimated mean (0.03-0.29, using a 1-5 scale). When comparing phantom images to patient images, effect size analysis revealed that the difference was within one-third of the inter- and intrareader variabilities. High correspondence between the four phantoms created using the same patient images was demonstrated by PixelPrint's production repeatability tests, with greater similarity scores between high-dose acquisitions of the phantoms than between clinical-dose acquisitions of a single phantom. We demonstrated PixelPrint's ability to produce lifelike CT lung phantoms reliably. These phantoms have the potential to provide ground-truth targets for validating the generalizability of inference-based decision-support algorithms between different health centers and imaging protocols and for optimizing examination protocols with realistic patient-based phantoms.

        "Abstract": "Breast density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer. In digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis, breast density is assessed visually using the four-category scale developed by the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (5th edition as of November 2022). Epidemiologically based risk models, such as the Tyrer-Cuzick model (version 8), demonstrate superior modeling performance when mammographic density is incorporated. Beyond just density, a separate mammographic measure of breast cancer risk is parenchymal textural complexity. With advancements in radiomics and deep learning, mammographic textural patterns can be assessed quantitatively and incorporated into risk models. Other supplemental screening modalities, such as breast US and MRI, offer independent risk measures complementary to those derived from mammography. Breast US allows the two components of fibroglandular tissue (stromal and glandular) to be visualized separately in a manner that is not possible with mammography. A higher glandular component at screening breast US is associated with higher risk. With MRI, a higher background parenchymal enhancement of the fibroglandular tissue has also emerged as an imaging marker for risk assessment. Imaging markers observed at mammography, US, and MRI are powerful tools in refining breast cancer risk prediction, beyond mammographic density alone.",

        "Title": "Radiomic phenotyping of the lung parenchyma in a lung cancer screening cohort.",
        "Abstract": "High-throughput extraction of radiomic features from low-dose CT scans can characterize the heterogeneity of the lung parenchyma and potentially aid in identifying subpopulations that may have higher risk of lung diseases, such as COPD, and lung cancer due to inflammation or obstruction of the airways. We aim to determine the feasibility of a lung radiomics phenotyping approach in a lung cancer screening cohort, while quantifying the effect of different CT reconstruction algorithms on phenotype robustness. We identified low-dose CT scans (n\u2009=\u2009308) acquired with Siemens Healthineers scanners from patients who completed low-dose CT within our lung cancer screening program between 2015 and 2018 and had two different sets of image reconstructions kernel available (i.e., medium (I30f.), sharp (I50f.)) for the same acquisition. Following segmentation of the lung field, a total of 26 radiomic features were extracted from the entire 3D lung-field using a previously validated fully-automated lattice-based software pipeline, adapted for low-dose CT scans. The lattice in-house software was used to extract features including gray-level histogram, co-occurrence, and run-length descriptors. The lattice approach uses non-overlapping windows for traversing along pixels of images and calculates different features. Each feature was averaged for each scan within a range of lattice window sizes (W) of 4, 8 and 20\u00a0mm. The extracted imaging features from both datasets were harmonized to correct for differences in image acquisition parameters. Subsequently, unsupervised hierarchical clustering was applied on the extracted features to identify distinct phenotypic patterns of the lung parenchyma, where consensus clustering was used to identify the optimal number of clusters (K\u2009=\u20092). Differences between phenotypes for demographic and clinical covariates including sex, age, BMI, pack-years of smoking, Lung-RADS and cancer diagnosis were assessed for each phenotype cluster, and then compared across clusters for the two different CT reconstruction algorithms using the cluster entanglement metric, where a lower entanglement coefficient corresponds to good cluster alignment. Furthermore, an independent set of low-dose CT scans (n\u2009=\u200988) from patients with available pulmonary function data on lung obstruction were analyzed using the identified optimal clusters to assess associations to lung obstruction and validate the lung phenotyping paradigm. Heatmaps generated by radiomic features identified two distinct lung parenchymal phenotype patterns across different feature extraction window sizes, for both reconstruction algorithms (P\u2009<\u20090.05 with K\u2009=\u20092). Associations of radiomic-based clusters with clinical covariates showed significant differences for BMI and pack-years of smoking (P\u2009<\u20090.05) for both reconstruction kernels. Radiomic phenotype patterns were more similar across the two reconstructed kernels, when smaller window sizes (W\u2009=\u20094 and 8\u00a0mm) were used for radiomic feature extraction, as deemed by their entanglement coefficient. Validation of clustering approaches using cluster mapping for the independent sample with lung obstruction also showed two statistically significant phenotypes (P\u2009<\u20090.05) with significant difference for BMI and smoking pack-years. Radiomic analysis can be used to characterize lung parenchymal phenotypes from low-dose CT scans, which appear reproducible for different reconstruction kernels. Further work should seek to evaluate the effect of additional CT acquisition parameters and validate these phenotypes in characterizing lung cancer screening populations, to potentially better stratify disease patterns and cancer risk.",

        "Abstract": "Our study investigates the effects of heterogeneity in image parameters on the reproducibility of prognostic performance of models built using radiomic biomarkers. We compare the prognostic performance of models derived from the heterogeneity-mitigated features with that of models obtained from raw features, to assess whether reproducibility of prognostic scores improves upon application of our methods. We used two datasets: The Breast I-SPY1 dataset-Baseline DCE-MRI scans of 156 women with locally advanced breast cancer, treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, publicly available via The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA); The NSCLC IO dataset-Baseline CT scans of 107 patients with stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), treated with pembrolizumab immunotherapy at our institution. Radiomic features (n\u2009=\u2009102) are extracted from the tumor ROIs. We use a variety of resampling and harmonization scenarios to mitigate the heterogeneity in image parameters. The patients were divided into groups based on batch variables. For each group, the radiomic phenotypes are combined with the clinical covariates into a prognostic model. The performance of the groups is assessed using the c-statistic, derived from a Cox proportional hazards model fitted on all patients within a group. The heterogeneity-mitigation scenario (radiomic features, derived from images that have been resampled to minimum voxel spacing, are harmonized using the image acquisition parameters as batch variables) gave models with highest prognostic scores (for e.g., IO dataset; batch variable: high kernel resolution-c-score: 0.66). The prognostic performance of patient groups is not comparable in case of models built using non-heterogeneity mitigated features (for e.g., I-SPY1 dataset; batch variable: small pixel spacing-c-score: 0.54, large pixel spacing-c-score: 0.65). The prognostic performance of patient groups is closer in case of heterogeneity-mitigated scenarios (for e.g., scenario-harmonize by voxel spacing parameters: IO dataset; thin slice-c-score: 0.62, thick slice-c-score: 0.60). Our results indicate that accounting for heterogeneity in image parameters is important to obtain more reproducible prognostic scores, irrespective of image site or modality. For non-heterogeneity mitigated models, the prognostic scores are not comparable across patient groups divided based on batch variables. This study can be a step in the direction of constructing reproducible radiomic biomarkers, thus increasing their application in clinical decision making.",

        "Abstract": "Radiomic approaches in precision medicine are promising, but variation associated with image acquisition factors can result in severe biases and low generalizability. Multicenter datasets used in these studies are often heterogeneous in multiple imaging parameters and/or have missing information, resulting in multimodal radiomic feature distributions. ComBat is a promising harmonization tool, but it only harmonizes by single/known variables and assumes standardized input data are normally distributed. We propose a procedure that sequentially harmonizes for multiple batch effects in an optimized order, called OPNested ComBat. Furthermore, we propose to address bimodality by employing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) grouping considered as either a batch variable (OPNested\u2009+\u2009GMM) or as a protected clinical covariate (OPNested - GMM). Methods were evaluated on features extracted with CapTK and PyRadiomics from two public lung computed tomography (CT) datasets. We found that OPNested ComBat improved harmonization performance over standard ComBat. OPNested\u2009+\u2009GMM ComBat exhibited the best harmonization performance but the lowest predictive performance, while OPNested - GMM ComBat showed poorer harmonization performance, but the highest predictive performance. Our findings emphasize that improved harmonization performance is no guarantee of improved predictive performance, and that these methods show promise for superior standardization of datasets heterogeneous in multiple or unknown imaging parameters and greater generalizability.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the demonstrated potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in breast cancer risk assessment for personalizing screening recommendations, further validation is required regarding AI model bias and generalizability. We performed external validation on a U.S. screening cohort of a mammography-derived AI breast cancer risk model originally developed for European screening cohorts. We retrospectively identified 176 breast cancers with exams 3 months to 2 years prior to cancer diagnosis and a random sample of 4963 controls from women with at least one-year negative follow-up. A risk score for each woman was calculated via the AI risk model. Age-adjusted areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) were estimated for the entire cohort and separately for White and Black women. The Gail 5-year risk model was also evaluated for comparison. The overall AUC was 0.68 (95% CIs 0.64\u22120.72) for all women, 0.67 (0.61\u22120.72) for White women, and 0.70 (0.65\u22120.76) for Black women. The AI risk model significantly outperformed the Gail risk model for all women p < 0.01 and for Black women p < 0.01, but not for White women p = 0.38. The performance of the mammography-derived AI risk model was comparable to previously reported European validation results; non-significantly different when comparing White and Black women; and overall, significantly higher than that of the Gail model.",

        "Abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most pervasive forms of cancer and its inherent intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity contributes towards its poor prognosis. Multiple studies have reported results from either private institutional data or publicly available datasets. However, current public datasets are limited in terms of having consistency in: a) data quality, b) quality of expert annotation of pathology, and c) availability of baseline results from computational algorithms. To address these limitations, here we propose the enhancement of the I-SPY1 data collection, with uniformly curated data, tumor annotations, and quantitative imaging features. Specifically, the proposed dataset includes a) uniformly processed scans that are harmonized to match intensity and spatial characteristics, facilitating immediate use in computational studies, b) computationally-generated and manually-revised expert annotations of tumor regions, as well as c) a comprehensive set of quantitative imaging (also known as radiomic) features corresponding to the tumor regions. This collection describes our contribution towards repeatable, reproducible, and comparative quantitative studies leading to new predictive, prognostic, and diagnostic assessments.",

        "Abstract": "We aim to determine the feasibility of a novel radiomic biomarker that can integrate with other established clinical prognostic factors to predict progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing first-line immunotherapy. Our study includes 107 patients with stage 4 NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab-based therapy (monotherapy: 30%, combination chemotherapy: 70%). The ITK-SNAP software was used for 3D tumor volume segmentation from pre-therapy CT scans. Radiomic features (n\u2009=\u2009102) were extracted using the CaPTk software. Impact of heterogeneity introduced by image physical dimensions (voxel spacing parameters) and acquisition parameters (contrast enhancement and CT reconstruction kernel) was mitigated by resampling the images to the minimum voxel spacing parameters and harmonization by a nested ComBat technique. This technique was initialized with radiomic features, clinical factors of age, sex, race, PD-L1 expression, ECOG status, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, recurrence event and months of progression-free survival, and image acquisition parameters as batch variables. Two phenotypes were identified using unsupervised hierarchical clustering of harmonized features. Prognostic factors, including PDL1 expression, ECOG status, BMI and smoking status, were combined with radiomic phenotypes in Cox regression models of PFS and Kaplan Meier (KM) curve-fitting. Cox model based on clinical factors had a c-statistic of 0.57, which increased to 0.63 upon addition of phenotypes derived from harmonized features. There were statistically significant differences in survival outcomes stratified by clinical covariates, as measured by the log-rank test (p\u2009=\u20090.034), which improved upon addition of phenotypes (p\u2009=\u20090.00022). We found that mitigation of heterogeneity by image resampling and nested ComBat harmonization improves prognostic value of phenotypes, resulting in better prediction of PFS when added to other prognostic variables.",

        "Abstract": "Radiomic features have a wide range of clinical applications, but variability due to image acquisition factors can affect their performance. The harmonization tool ComBat is a promising solution but is limited by inability to harmonize multimodal distributions, unknown imaging parameters, and multiple imaging parameters. In this study, we propose two methods for addressing these limitations. We propose a sequential method that allows for harmonization of radiomic features by multiple imaging parameters (Nested ComBat). We also employ a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based method (GMM ComBat) where scans are split into groupings based on the shape of the distribution used for harmonization as a batch effect and subsequent harmonization by a known imaging parameter. These two methods were evaluated on features extracted with CapTK and PyRadiomics from two public lung computed tomography datasets. We found that Nested ComBat exhibited similar performance to standard ComBat in reducing the percentage of features with statistically significant differences in distribution attributable to imaging parameters. GMM ComBat improved harmonization performance over standard ComBat (-\u200911%, -\u200910% for Lung3/CAPTK, Lung3/PyRadiomics harmonizing by kernel resolution). Features harmonized with a variant of the Nested method and the GMM split method demonstrated similar c-statistics and Kaplan-Meier curves when used in survival analyses.",

        "Abstract": "Improved breast cancer risk assessment models are needed to enable personalized screening strategies that achieve better harm-to-benefit ratio based on earlier detection and better breast cancer outcomes than existing screening guidelines. Computational mammographic phenotypes have demonstrated a promising role in breast cancer risk prediction. With the recent exponential growth of computational efficiency, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, driven by the introduction of deep learning, has expanded the utility of imaging in predictive models. Consequently, AI-based imaging-derived data has led to some of the most promising tools for precision breast cancer screening.",

        "Abstract": "We evaluate radiomic phenotypes derived from CT scans as early predictors of overall survival (OS) after chemoradiation in stage III primary lung adenocarcinoma. We retrospectively analyzed 110 thoracic CT scans acquired between April 2012-October 2018. Patients received a median radiation dose of 66.6 Gy at 1.8 Gy/fraction delivered with proton (55.5%) and photon (44.5%) beam treatment, as well as concurrent chemotherapy (89%) with carboplatin-based (55.5%) and cisplatin-based (36.4%) doublets. A total of 56 death events were recorded. Using manual tumor segmentations, 107 radiomic features were extracted. Feature harmonization using ComBat was performed to mitigate image heterogeneity due to the presence or lack of intravenous contrast material and variability in CT scanner vendors. A binary radiomic phenotype to predict OS was derived through the unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the first principal components explaining 85% of the variance of the radiomic features. C-scores and likelihood ratio tests (LRT) were used to compare the performance of a baseline Cox model based on ECOG status and age, with a model integrating the radiomic phenotype with such clinical predictors. The model integrating the radiomic phenotype (C-score = 0.69, 95% CI = (0.62, 0.77)) significantly improved (p<0.005) upon the baseline model (C-score = 0.65, CI = (0.57, 0.73)). Our results suggest that harmonized radiomic phenotypes can significantly improve OS prediction in stage III NSCLC after chemoradiation.",

        "Abstract": "(1) Background: The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of four breast cancer risk prediction models by race, molecular subtype, family history of breast cancer, age, and BMI. (2) Methods: Using a cohort of women aged 40-84 without prior history of breast cancer who underwent screening mammography from 2006 to 2015, we generated breast cancer risk estimates using the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment tool (BCRAT), BRCAPRO, Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) and combined BRCAPRO+BCRAT models. Model calibration and discrimination were compared using observed-to-expected ratios (O/E) and the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) among patients with at least five years of follow-up. (3) Results: We observed comparable discrimination and calibration across models. There was no significant difference in model performance between Black and White women. Model discrimination was poorer for HER2+ and triple-negative subtypes compared with ER/PR+HER2-. The BRCAPRO+BCRAT model displayed improved calibration and discrimination compared to BRCAPRO among women with a family history of breast cancer. Across models, discriminatory accuracy was greater among obese than non-obese women. When defining high risk as a 5-year risk of 1.67% or greater, models demonstrated discordance in 2.9% to 19.7% of patients. (4) Conclusions: Our results can inform the implementation of risk assessment and risk-based screening among women undergoing screening mammography.",

Four readers included for segmentation are: a data scientist (BY), a medical student (LS), a radiology trainee (MH), and a specialty-trained radiologist (SK) for a total of 293 patients from two publicly available databases. S\u00f8rensen-Dice (SD) coefficients and low rank Pearson correlation coefficients (CC) of 429 radiomics were calculated to assess interobserver variability. Cox proportional hazard (CPH) models and Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves of overall survival (OS) prediction for each dataset were also generated. SD and CC for segmentations demonstrated high similarities, yielding, SD: 0.79 and CC: 0.92 (BY-SK), SD: 0.81 and CC: 0.83 (LS-SK), and SD: 0.84 and CC: 0.91 (MH-SK) in average for both databases, respectively. OS through the maximal CPH model for the two datasets yielded c-statistics of 0.7 (95% CI) and 0.69 (95% CI), while adding radiomic and clinical variables (sex, stage/morphological status, and histology) together.

        "Abstract": "Digital mammography has seen an explosion in the number of radiomic features used for risk-assessment modeling. However, having more features is not necessarily beneficial, as some features may be overly sensitive to imaging physics (contrast, noise, and image sharpness). To measure the effects of imaging physics, we analyzed the feature variation across imaging acquisition settings (kV, mAs) using an anthropomorphic phantom. We also analyzed the intra-woman variation (IWV), a measure of how much a feature varies between breasts with similar parenchymal patterns-a woman's left and right breasts. From 341 features, we identified \"robust\" features that minimized the effects of imaging physics and IWV. We also investigated whether robust features offered better case-control classification in an independent data set of 575 images, all with an overall BI-RADS",

Utilizing very brief user training annotations and the adaptive geodesic distance transform, an ensemble of SVMs is trained, providing a patient-specific model applied to the whole image. Two experts segmented each cohort twice with our method and twice manually. The IML method was faster than manual annotation by 53.1% on average. We found significant (",

Purpose To compare associations of breast density estimates from DBT and DM with breast cancer. Materials and Methods This retrospective case-control study used contralateral DM/DBT studies from women with unilateral breast cancer and age- and ethnicity-matched controls (September 19, 2011-January 6, 2015). Volumetric percent density (VPD%) was estimated from DBT using previously validated software. For comparison, the publicly available Laboratory for Individualized Breast Radiodensity Assessment software package, or LIBRA, was used to estimate area-based percent density (APD%) from raw and processed DM images. The commercial Quantra and Volpara software packages were applied to raw DM images to estimate VPD% with use of physics-based models. Density measures were compared by using Spearman correlation coefficients (",

        "Abstract": "Background Suppression of background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) is commonly observed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) at contrast-enhanced breast MRI. It was hypothesized that nonsuppressed BPE may be associated with inferior response to NAC. Purpose To investigate the relationship between lack of BPE suppression and pathologic response. Materials and Methods A retrospective review was performed for women with menopausal status data who were treated for breast cancer by one of 10 drug arms (standard NAC with or without experimental agents) between May 2010 and November 2016 in the Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging and Molecular Analysis 2, or I-SPY 2 TRIAL (NCT01042379). Patients underwent MRI at four points: before treatment (T0), early treatment (T1), interregimen (T2), and before surgery (T3). BPE was quantitatively measured by using automated fibroglandular tissue segmentation. To test the hypothesis effectively, a subset of examinations with BPE with high-quality segmentation was selected. BPE change from T0 was defined as suppressed or nonsuppressed for each point.

        "Abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently been popular for classification and segmentation through numerous network architectures offering a substantial performance improvement. Their value has been particularly appreciated in the domain of biomedical applications, where even a small improvement in the predicted segmented region (e.g., a malignancy) compared to the ground truth can potentially lead to better diagnosis or treatment planning. Here, we introduce a novel architecture, namely the Overall Convolutional Network (O-Net), which takes advantage of different pooling levels and convolutional layers to extract more deeper local and containing global context. Our quantitative results on 2D images from two distinct datasets show that O-Net can achieve a higher dice coefficient when compared to either a U-Net or a Pyramid Scene Parsing Net. We also look into the stability of results for training and validation sets which can show the robustness of model compared with new datasets. In addition to comparison to the decoder, we use different encoders including simple, VGG Net, and ResNet. The ResNet encoder could help to improve the results in most of the cases.",

        "Title": "Deep-LIBRA: An artificial-intelligence method for robust quantification of breast density with independent validation in breast cancer risk assessment.",
        "Abstract": "Breast density is an important risk factor for breast cancer that also affects the specificity and sensitivity of screening mammography. Current federal legislation mandates reporting of breast density for all women undergoing breast cancer screening. Clinically, breast density is assessed visually using the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting And Data System (BI-RADS) scale. Here, we introduce an artificial intelligence (AI) method to estimate breast density from digital mammograms. Our method leverages deep learning using two convolutional neural network architectures to accurately segment the breast area. An AI algorithm combining superpixel generation and radiomic machine learning is then applied to differentiate dense from non-dense tissue regions within the breast, from which breast density is estimated. Our method was trained and validated on a multi-racial, multi-institutional dataset of 15,661 images (4,437 women), and then tested on an independent matched case-control dataset of 6368 digital mammograms (414 cases; 1178 controls) for both breast density estimation and case-control discrimination. On the independent dataset, breast percent density (PD) estimates from Deep-LIBRA and an expert reader were strongly correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.90). Moreover, in a model adjusted for age and BMI, Deep-LIBRA yielded a higher case-control discrimination performance (area under the ROC curve, AUC = 0.612 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.584, 0.640]) compared to four other widely-used research and commercial breast density assessment methods (AUCs = 0.528 to 0.599). Our results suggest a strong agreement of breast density estimates between Deep-LIBRA and gold-standard assessment by an expert reader, as well as improved performance in breast cancer risk assessment over state-of-the-art open-source and commercial methods.",

        "Abstract": "The field of radiogenomics largely focuses on developing imaging surrogates for genomic signatures and integrating imaging, genomic, and molecular data to develop combined personalized biomarkers for characterizing various diseases. Our study aims to highlight the current state-of-the-art and the role of radiogenomics in cancer research, focusing mainly on solid tumors, and is broadly divided into four sections. The first section reviews representative studies that establish the biologic basis of radiomic signatures using gene expression and molecular profiling information. The second section includes studies that aim to non-invasively predict molecular subtypes of tumors using radiomic signatures. The third section reviews studies that evaluate the potential to augment the performance of established prognostic signatures by combining complementary information encoded by radiomic and genomic signatures derived from cancer tumors. The fourth section includes studies that focus on ascertaining the biological significance of radiomic phenotypes. We conclude by discussing current challenges and opportunities in the field, such as the importance of coordination between imaging device manufacturers, regulatory organizations, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, and physicians for the effective standardization of the results from radiogenomic signatures and for the potential use of these findings to improve precision care for cancer patients.",

        "Abstract": "Among non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with therapeutically targetable tumor mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), not all patients respond to targeted therapy. Combining circulating-tumor DNA (ctDNA), clinical variables, and radiomic phenotypes may improve prediction of EGFR-targeted therapy outcomes for NSCLC. This single-center retrospective study included 40 EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC patients treated with EGFR-targeted therapy. ctDNA data included number of mutations and detection of EGFR T790M. Clinical data included age, smoking status, and\u00a0ECOG performance status. Baseline chest CT scans were analyzed to extract 429 radiomic features from each primary tumor. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was used to group tumors into phenotypes. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves and Cox proportional hazards regression were modeled for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Likelihood ratio test (LRT) was used to compare fit between models. Among 40 patients (73% women, median age 62\u00a0years), consensus clustering identified two radiomic phenotypes. For PFS, the model combining radiomic phenotypes with ctDNA and clinical variables had c-statistic of 0.77 and a better fit (LRT p\u2009=\u20090.01) than the model with clinical and ctDNA variables alone with a c-statistic of 0.73. For OS, adding radiomic phenotypes resulted in c-statistic of 0.83 versus 0.80 when using clinical and ctDNA variables (LRT p\u2009=\u20090.08). Both models showed separation of K-M curves dichotomized by median prognostic score (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Combining radiomic phenotypes, ctDNA, and clinical variables may enhance precision oncology approaches to managing advanced non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations.",

        "Abstract": "Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI provides both morphological and functional information regarding breast tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The purpose of this retrospective study is to test if prediction models combining multiple MRI features outperform models with single features. Four features were quantitatively calculated in each MRI exam: functional tumor volume, longest diameter, sphericity, and contralateral background parenchymal enhancement. Logistic regression analysis was used to study the relationship between MRI variables and pathologic complete response (pCR). Predictive performance was estimated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The full cohort was stratified by hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status (positive or negative). A total of 384 patients (median age: 49\u2009y/o) were included. Results showed analysis with combined features achieved higher AUCs than analysis with any feature alone. AUCs estimated for the combined versus highest AUCs among single features were 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76, 0.86) versus 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.85) in the full cohort, 0.83 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.92) versus 0.73 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.84) in HR-positive/HER2-negative, 0.88 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.97) versus 0.78 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.89) in HR-positive/HER2-positive, 0.83 (95% CI not available) versus 0.75 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.81) in HR-negative/HER2-positive, and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.91) versus 0.75 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.83) in triple negatives. Multi-feature MRI analysis improved pCR prediction over analysis of any individual feature that we examined. Additionally, the improvements in prediction were more notable when analysis was conducted according to cancer subtype.",

        "Abstract": "Background The associations of density measures from the publicly available Laboratory for Individualized Breast Radiodensity Assessment (LIBRA) software with breast cancer have primarily focused on estimates from the contralateral breast at the time of diagnosis. Purpose To evaluate LIBRA measures on mammograms obtained before breast cancer diagnosis and compare their performance to established density measures. Materials and Methods For this retrospective case-control study, full-field digital mammograms in for-processing (raw) and for-presentation (processed) formats were obtained (March 2008 to December 2011) in women who developed breast cancer an average of 2 years later and in age-matched control patients. LIBRA measures included absolute dense area and area percent density (PD) from both image formats. For comparison, dense area and PD were assessed by using the research software (Cumulus), and volumetric PD (VPD) and absolute dense volume were estimated with a commercially available software (Volpara). Density measures were compared by using Spearman correlation coefficients (",

One phantom was based off a computational breast model; it was 3D printed by CIRS (Computerized Imaging Reference Systems, Inc., Norfolk, VA) under license from the University of Pennsylvania. We investigate how the textural realism of this phantom compares against a phantom derived from an actual patient's mammogram (\"Rachel\", Gammex 169, Madison, WI). Images of each phantom were acquired at three kV in 1 kV increments using auto-time technique settings. Acquisitions at each technique setting were repeated twice, resulting in six images per phantom. In the raw (\"FOR PROCESSING\") images, 341 features were calculated; ",

        "Abstract": "Studies have shown that combining calculations of radiomic features with estimates of mammographic density results in an even better assessment of breast cancer risk than density alone. However, to ensure that risk assessment calculations are consistent across different imaging acquisition settings, it is important to identify features that are not overly sensitive to changes in these settings. In this study, digital mammography (DM) images of an anthropomorphic phantom (\"Rachel\", Gammex 169, Madison, WI) were acquired at various technique settings. We varied kV and mAs, which control contrast and noise, respectively. DM images in women with negative screening exams were also analyzed. Radiomic features were calculated in the raw (\"FOR PROCESSING\") DM images; i.e., grey-level histogram, co-occurrence, run length, fractal dimension, Gabor Wavelet, local binary pattern, Laws, and co-occurrence Laws features. For each feature, the range of variation across technique settings in phantom images was calculated. This range was scaled against the range of variation in the clinical distribution (specifically, the range corresponding to the middle 90% of the distribution). In order for a radiomic feature to be considered robust, this metric of imaging acquisition variation (IAV) should be as small as possible (approaching zero). An IAV threshold of 0.25 was proposed for the purpose of this study. Out of 341 features, 284 features (83%) met the threshold IAV \u2264 0.25. In conclusion, we have developed a method to identify robust radiomic features in DM.",

        "Abstract": "We analyzed DCE-MR images from 132 women with locally advanced breast cancer from the I-SPY1 trial to evaluate changes of intra-tumor heterogeneity for augmenting early prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Utilizing image registration, voxel-wise changes including tumor deformations and changes in DCE-MRI kinetic features were computed to characterize heterogeneous changes within the tumor. Using five-fold cross-validation, logistic regression and Cox regression were performed to model pCR and RFS, respectively. The extracted imaging features were evaluated in augmenting established predictors, including functional tumor volume (FTV) and histopathologic and demographic factors, using the area under the curve (AUC) and the C-statistic as performance measures. The extracted voxel-wise features were also compared to analogous conventional aggregated features to evaluate the potential advantage of voxel-wise analysis. Voxel-wise features improved prediction of pCR (AUC\u2009=\u20090.78 (\u00b10.03) vs 0.71 (\u00b10.04), p\u2009<\u20090.05 and RFS (C-statistic\u2009=\u20090.76 (\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05), vs 0.63 (\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01)), p\u2009<\u20090.05, while models based on analogous aggregate imaging features did not show appreciable performance changes (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Furthermore, all selected voxel-wise features demonstrated significant association with outcome (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Thus, precise measures of voxel-wise changes in tumor heterogeneity extracted from registered DCE-MRI scans can improve early prediction of neoadjuvant treatment outcomes in locally advanced breast cancer.",

        "Abstract": "The complexity of modern multi-parametric MRI has increasingly challenged conventional interpretations of such images. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful approach to integrating diverse and complex imaging data into signatures of diagnostic and predictive value. It has also allowed us to progress from group comparisons to imaging biomarkers that offer value on an individual basis. We review several directions of research around this topic, emphasizing the use of machine learning in personalized predictions of clinical outcome, in breaking down broad umbrella diagnostic categories into more detailed and precise subtypes, and in non-invasively estimating cancer molecular characteristics. These methods and studies contribute to the field of precision medicine, by introducing more specific diagnostic and predictive biomarkers of clinical outcome, therefore pointing to better matching of treatments to patients.",

        "Title": "Background parenchymal enhancement on breast MRI: A comprehensive review.",
        "Abstract": "The degree of normal fibroglandular tissue that enhances on breast MRI, known as background parenchymal enhancement (BPE), was initially described as an incidental finding that could affect interpretation performance. While BPE is now established to be a physiologic phenomenon that is affected by both endogenous and exogenous hormone levels, evidence supporting the notion that BPE frequently masks breast cancers is limited. However, compelling data have emerged to suggest BPE is an independent marker of breast cancer risk and breast cancer treatment outcomes. Specifically, multiple studies have shown that elevated BPE levels, measured qualitatively or quantitatively, are associated with a greater risk of developing breast cancer. Evidence also suggests that BPE could be a predictor of neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment response and overall breast cancer treatment outcomes. These discoveries come at a time when breast cancer screening and treatment have moved toward an increased emphasis on targeted and individualized approaches, of which the identification of imaging features that can predict cancer diagnosis and treatment response is an increasingly recognized component. Historically, researchers have primarily studied quantitative tumor imaging features in pursuit of clinically useful biomarkers. However, the need to segment less well-defined areas of normal tissue for quantitative BPE measurements presents its own unique challenges. Furthermore, there is no consensus on the optimal timing on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI for BPE quantitation. This article comprehensively reviews BPE with a particular focus on its potential to increase precision approaches to breast cancer risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. It also describes areas of needed future research, such as the applicability of BPE to women at average risk, the biological underpinnings of BPE, and the standardization of BPE characterization.

        "Title": "Effect of Mammographic Screening Modality on Breast Density Assessment: Digital Mammography versus Digital Breast Tomosynthesis.",
        "Abstract": "Background Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density categories assigned by interpreting radiologists often influence decisions surrounding supplemental breast cancer screening and risk assessment. The landscape of mammographic screening continuously evolves, and different mammographic screening modalities may result in different perception of density, reflected in different assignment of BI-RADS density categories. Purpose To investigate the effect of screening mammography modality on BI-RADS breast density assessments. Materials and Methods Data were retrospectively analyzed from 24 736 individual women (42.3% [10 455 of 24 736] white women, 57.7% [14 281 of 24 736] black women; mean age, 56.3 years; age range, 40.0-74.9 years) who underwent from one to seven mammographic screening examinations from September 2010 through February 2017 (60 766 examinations). Three screening modalities were used: digital mammography alone (8935 examinations); digital mammography with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT; 30 779 examinations); and synthetic mammography with DBT (21 052 examinations). Random-effects logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the likelihood of assignment to high versus low BI-RADS density category according to each modality, adjusted for ethnicity, age, body mass index (BMI), and radiologist. The interactions of modality with ethnicity and BMI on density categorization were also tested with the model. Results Women screened with DBT versus digital mammography alone had lower likelihood regarding categorization of high density breasts (digital mammography and DBT vs digital mammography: odds ratio, 0.69 [95% confidence interval: 0.61, 0.80], ",

        "Abstract": "We retrospectively analyzed negative screening digital mammograms from 115 women who developed unilateral breast cancer at least one year later and 460 matched controls. Texture features were estimated in multiple breast regions defined by an anatomically-oriented polar grid, and were weighted by their position and underlying dense versus fatty tissue composition. Elastic net regression with cross-validation was performed and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to evaluate ability to predict breast cancer. We also compared our anatomy-augmented features to current state-of-the-art in which parenchymal texture was assessed without considering breast anatomy and evaluated the added value of the extracted features to breast density, body-mass-index (BMI) and age as baseline predictors. Our anatomy-augmented texture features resulted in higher discriminatory capacity (AUC\u2009=\u20090.63 vs. AUC\u2009=\u20090.59) when breast anatomy was not considered (p\u2009=\u20090.021), with dense tissue regions and the central breast quadrant being more heavily weighted. Texture also improved baseline models (from AUC\u2009=\u20090.62 to AUC\u2009=\u20090.67, p\u2009=\u20090.029). Our findings suggest that incorporating breast anatomy information could augment imaging markers of breast cancer risk with the potential to improve personalized breast cancer risk assessment.",

        "Abstract": "Whole breast segmentation is an essential task in quantitative analysis of breast MRI for cancer risk assessment. It is challenging, mainly, because the chest-wall line (CWL) can be very difficult to locate due to its spatially varying appearance-caused by both nature and imaging artifacts-and neighboring distracting structures. This paper proposes an automatic three-dimensional (3-D) segmentation method, termed DeepSeA, of whole breast for breast MRI.",

        "Title": "Validation of the Textural Realism of a 3D Anthropomorphic Phantom for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis.",
        "Abstract": "In this paper, texture calculations are used to validate the realism of a physical anthropomorphic phantom for digital breast tomosynthesis. The texture features were compared against clinical mammography data. Three groups of features (grey-level histogram, co-occurrence, and run-length) were considered. The features were analyzed over a broad range of technique settings (kV and mAs). These calculations were done in the central slice of the reconstruction as well as the synthetic 2D mammogram. For each feature, the clinical data were binned into strata based on the compressed breast thickness. It was demonstrated that the clinical features vary by thickness. To evaluate the realism of the phantom, each feature was compared against clinical data in the same thickness stratum. For the purpose of this paper, a feature was considered to be realistic if it was within the middle 95% of the statistical distribution of clinical values. In the reconstruction, most features were found to exhibit realism; specifically, all 12 grey-level histogram features, four out of seven co-occurrence features, and three out of seven run-length features. The realism of most features was robust to changes in the technique settings. However, in the synthetic 2D mammogram, fewer features were found to exhibit realism. In conclusion, this paper provides a validation of the textural realism of the phantom in the reconstruction, and shows that there is less realism in the synthetic 2D mammogram. We identify the features that should be considered to refine the design of the phantom in future work.",

        "Title": "Cancer imaging phenomics toolkit: quantitative imaging analytics for precision diagnostics and predictive modeling of clinical outcome.",
        "Abstract": "The growth of multiparametric imaging protocols has paved the way for quantitative imaging phenotypes that predict treatment response and clinical outcome, reflect underlying cancer molecular characteristics and spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and can guide personalized treatment planning. This growth has underlined the need for efficient quantitative analytics to derive high-dimensional imaging signatures of diagnostic and predictive value in this emerging era of integrated precision diagnostics. This paper presents cancer imaging phenomics toolkit (CaPTk), a new and dynamically growing software platform for analysis of radiographic images of cancer, currently focusing on brain, breast, and lung cancer. CaPTk leverages the value of quantitative imaging analytics along with machine learning to derive phenotypic imaging signatures, based on two-level functionality. First, image analysis algorithms are used to extract comprehensive panels of diverse and complementary features, such as multiparametric intensity histogram distributions, texture, shape, kinetics, connectomics, and spatial patterns. At the second level, these quantitative imaging signatures are fed into multivariate machine learning models to produce diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. Results from clinical studies in three areas are shown: (i)\u00a0computational neuro-oncology of brain gliomas for precision diagnostics, prediction of outcome, and treatment planning; (ii)\u00a0prediction of treatment response for breast and lung cancer, and (iii)\u00a0risk assessment for breast cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose To evaluate agreement between automated estimates of breast density made from standard-dose versus synthetic digital mammograms in a large cohort of women undergoing screening. Materials and Methods This study received institutional review board approval with waiver of consent. A total of 3668 negative (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category 1 or 2) digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) screening examinations consecutively performed over a 4-month period at one institution for which both standard-dose and synthetic mammograms were available for analysis were retrospectively analyzed. All mammograms were acquired with a Selenia Dimensions system (Hologic, Bedford, Mass), and synthetic mammograms were generated by using the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved \"C-View\" software module. The \"For Presentation\" standard-dose mammograms and synthetic images were analyzed by using a fully automated algorithm. Agreement between density estimates was assessed by using Pearson correlation, linear regression, and Bland-Altman analysis. Differences were evaluated by using the paired Student t test. Results Breast percentage density (PD) estimates from synthetic and standard-dose mammograms were highly correlated (r = 0.92, P < .001), and the 95% Bland-Altman limits of agreement between PD estimates were -6.4% to 9.9%. Synthetic mammograms had PD estimates by an average of 1.7% higher than standard-dose mammograms (P < .001), with a larger disagreement by 1.56% in women with highly dense breast tissue (P < .0001). Conclusion Fully automated estimates of breast density made from synthetic mammograms are generally comparable to those made from standard-dose mammograms. This may be important, as standard two-dimensional mammographic images are increasingly being replaced by synthetic mammograms in DBT screening in an attempt to reduce radiation dose. ",

Studies have consistently shown a strong relationship between breast cancer risk and mammographic parenchymal patterns, typically assessed by percent mammographic density.

        "Abstract": "Observational data indicate that behaviors that shift energetic homeostasis, such as exercise, may decrease the risk of developing breast cancer by reducing the amount of energy-dense, metabolically active adipose tissue. Between December 2008 and April 2013, we conducted a single-blind, 5-month, clinical trial that randomized premenopausal women at high risk of developing breast cancer to one of three groups: 150 min/wk of aerobic exercise (low dose), 300 min/wk of aerobic exercise (high dose), or control. Body composition was assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) was quantified using computerized algorithms on breast dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Over 5 months, compared with the control group: the low-dose and high-dose groups lost -1.5 \u00b1 0.5 and -1.3 \u00b1 0.5 kg of body mass (linear Ptrend = 0.032); -1.5 \u00b1 0.4 and -1.4 \u00b1 0.3 kg of fat mass (linear Ptrend = 0.003); -1.3 \u00b1 0.3 and -1.4 \u00b1 0.3% of body fat (linear Ptrend < 0.001); -15.9 \u00b1 5.4 and -26.6 \u00b1 5.0 cm(2) of subcutaneous adipose tissue (linear Ptrend < 0.001); and -6.6 \u00b1 1.9 and -5.0 \u00b1 1.9 cm(2) visceral adipose tissue (nonlinear Ptrend = 0.037). For each -1 cm(2) reduction in visceral adipose tissue, BPE decreased by -3.43 \u00b1 1.34 cm(2) (P = 0.010) and explained 9.7% of the variability in BPE. Changes in other aforementioned body composition outcomes did not significantly correlate with changes in BPE. These mechanistic data support observational evidence that shifting energetic homeostasis through exercise may alter the risk of developing breast cancer. Additional adequately powered studies are needed to confirm and expand upon our findings that changes in body composition are associated with changes in BPE.

        "Title": "The Impact of Acquisition Dose on Quantitative Breast Density Estimation with Digital Mammography: Results from ACRIN PA 4006.",
        "Abstract": "Purpose To investigate the impact of radiation dose on breast density estimation in digital mammography. Materials and Methods With institutional review board approval and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance under waiver of consent, a cohort of women from the American College of Radiology Imaging Network Pennsylvania 4006 trial was retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent breast screening with a combination of dose protocols, including standard full-field digital mammography, low-dose digital mammography, and digital breast tomosynthesis. A total of 5832 images from 486 women were analyzed with previously validated, fully automated software for quantitative estimation of density. Clinical Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density assessment results were also available from the trial reports. The influence of image acquisition radiation dose on quantitative breast density estimation was investigated with analysis of variance and linear regression. Pairwise comparisons of density estimations at different dose levels were performed with Student t test. Agreement of estimation was evaluated with quartile-weighted Cohen kappa values and Bland-Altman limits of agreement. Results Radiation dose of image acquisition did not significantly affect quantitative density measurements (analysis of variance, P = .37 to P = .75), with percent density demonstrating a high overall correlation between protocols (r = 0.88-0.95; weighted \u03ba = 0.83-0.90). However, differences in breast percent density (1.04% and 3.84%, P < .05) were observed within high BI-RADS density categories, although they were significantly correlated across the different acquisition dose levels (r = 0.76-0.92, P < .05). Conclusion Precision and reproducibility of automated breast density measurements with digital mammography are not substantially affected by variations in radiation dose; thus, the use of low-dose techniques for the purpose of density estimation may be feasible.

        "Abstract": "An analytical framework is presented for evaluating the equivalence of parenchymal texture features across different full-field digital mammography (FFDM) systems using a physical breast phantom. Phantom images (FOR PROCESSING) are acquired from three FFDM systems using their automated exposure control setting. A panel of texture features, including gray-level histogram, co-occurrence, run length, and structural descriptors, are extracted. To identify features that are robust across imaging systems, a series of equivalence tests are performed on the feature distributions, in which the extent of their intersystem variation is compared to their intrasystem variation via the Hodges-Lehmann test statistic. Overall, histogram and structural features tend to be most robust across all systems, and certain features, such as edge enhancement, tend to be more robust to intergenerational differences between detectors of a single vendor than to intervendor differences. Texture features extracted from larger regions of interest (i.e., [Formula: see text]) and with a larger offset length (i.e., [Formula: see text]), when applicable, also appear to be more robust across imaging systems. This framework and observations from our experiments may benefit applications utilizing mammographic texture analysis on images acquired in multivendor settings, such as in multicenter studies of computer-aided detection and breast cancer risk assessment.",

Recent studies also suggest that parenchymal texture features, which are more granular descriptors of the parenchymal pattern, can provide additional information about breast cancer risk. To date, most studies have measured mammographic texture within selected regions of interest (ROIs) in the breast, which cannot adequately capture the complexity of the parenchymal pattern throughout the whole breast. To better characterize patterns of the parenchymal tissue, the authors have developed a fully automated software pipeline based on a novel lattice-based strategy to extract a range of parenchymal texture features from the entire breast region.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for women diagnosed with breast cancer, either before or early on in treatment, is critical to judicious patient selection and tailoring the treatment regimen. In this paper, we investigate the role of contrast agent kinetic heterogeneity features derived from breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for predicting treatment response. We propose a set of kinetic statistic descriptors and present preliminary results showing the discriminatory capacity of the proposed descriptors for predicting complete and non-complete responders as assessed from pre-treatment imaging exams. The study population consisted of 15 participants: 8 complete responders and 7 non-complete responders. Using the proposed kinetic features, we trained a leave-one-out logistic regression classifier that performs with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.84 under the ROC. We compare the predictive value of our features against commonly used MRI features including kinetics of the characteristic kinetic curve (CKC), maximum peak enhancement (MPE), hotspot signal enhancement ratio (SER), and longest tumor diameter that give lower AUCs of 0.71, 0.66, 0.64, and 0.54, respectively. Our proposed kinetic statistics thus outperform the conventional kinetic descriptors as well as the classifier using a combination of all the conventional descriptors (i.e., CKC, MPE, SER, and longest diameter), which gives an AUC of 0.74. These findings suggest that heterogeneity-based DCE-MRI kinetic statistics could serve as potential imaging biomarkers for tumor characterization and could be used to improve candidate patient selection even before the start of the neoadjuvant treatment.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to assess the difference in fibroglandular volume and background parenchymal enhancement in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers on contrast-enhanced breast MRI (CE-MRI) performed before and immediately after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO). MATERIALS AND METHODS. We retrospectively compared fibroglandular volume and background parenchymal enhancement in 55 female BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers before and after RRSO using standard BI-RADS categories and a paired Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U test. A two-sample Wilcoxon test was performed to compare fibroglandular volume and background parenchymal enhancement in women with and without subsequent breast cancer diagnosis on follow-up. RESULTS. The median time to post-RRSO CE-MRI was 8 months (range, 1-40 months). There was no difference in fibroglandular volume before and after RRSO (p = 0.65). The mean background parenchymal enhancement was 2.5 (range, 1-4) before and 1.5 (range, 1-4) after RRSO (overall range, -2.5 to 1.5; p = 0.0001). Breast cancer was detected in nine women at a median time of 4.8 years (range, 1.8-13.3 years) after RRSO. For women who received a diagnosis of breast cancer after RRSO compared with those who did not, mean background parenchymal enhancement before RRSO was 3 (range, 2-4) versus 2.5 (range, 1-4; p = 0.001), and mean background parenchymal enhancement after RRSO was 2.5 (range, 1.5-4) versus 1.5 (range 2-4; p = 0.0018). There was no difference in fibroglandular volume before and after RRSO. CONCLUSION. In BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, we observed a significant reduction in background parenchymal enhancement on the first CE-MRI after RRSO and no significant change in fibroglandular volume. Higher background parenchymal enhancement before and after RRSO was observed in women who subsequently received a diagnosis of breast cancer. This suggests that background parenchymal enhancement, rather than fibro-glandular volume, may be a more sensitive imaging biomarker of breast cancer risk.",

A preventive exercise intervention might address the same hormonal issues, yet have fewer serious side effects and less negative impact on quality of life as compared to prophylactic mastectomy. WISER Sister was a randomized controlled trial which examined effects of two doses of exercise training on endogenous sex hormone exposure, hormonally active breast tissue, and other breast cancer risk factors.",

However, these trials were performed at sites where conventional mammographic screening was concurrently performed, possibly leading to selection biases or with complex, multireader algorithms not reflecting general clinical practice. Our study reports the impact on screening outcomes for DBT screening implemented in an entire clinic population.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate assessment of a woman's risk to develop specific subtypes of breast cancer is critical for appropriate utilization of chemopreventative measures, such as with tamoxifen in preventing estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer. In this context, we investigate quantitative measures of breast density and parenchymal texture, measures of glandular tissue content and tissue structure, as risk factors for estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. Mediolateral oblique (MLO) view digital mammograms of the contralateral breast from 106 women with unilateral invasive breast cancer were retrospectively analyzed. Breast density and parenchymal texture were analyzed via fully-automated software. Logistic regression with feature selection and was performed to predict ER+ versus ER- cancer status. A combined model considering all imaging measures extracted was compared to baseline models consisting of density-alone and texture-alone features. Area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Delong's test were used to compare the models' discriminatory capacity for receptor status. The density-alone model had a discriminatory capacity of 0.62 AUC (p=0.05). The texture-alone model had a higher discriminatory capacity of 0.70 AUC (p=0.001), which was not significantly different compared to the density-alone model (p=0.37). In contrast the combined density-texture logistic regression model had a discriminatory capacity of 0.82 AUC (p<0.001), which was statistically significantly higher than both the density-alone (p<0.001) and texture-alone regression models (p=0.04). The combination of breast density and texture measures may have the potential to identify women specifically at risk for estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer and could be useful in triaging women into appropriate risk-reduction strategies.",

        "Abstract": "Breast tumors are heterogeneous lesions. Intra-tumor heterogeneity presents a major challenge for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Few studies have worked on capturing tumor heterogeneity from imaging. Most studies to date consider aggregate measures for tumor characterization. In this work we capture tumor heterogeneity by partitioning tumor pixels into subregions and extracting heterogeneity wavelet kinetic (HetWave) features from breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to obtain the spatiotemporal patterns of the wavelet coefficients and contrast agent uptake from each partition. Using a genetic algorithm for feature selection, and a logistic regression classifier with leave one-out cross validation, we tested our proposed HetWave features for the task of classifying breast cancer recurrence risk. The classifier based on our features gave an ROC AUC of 0.78, outperforming previously proposed kinetic, texture, and spatial enhancement variance features which give AUCs of 0.69, 0.64, and 0.65, respectively.",

Studies suggest that the relative amount of fibroglandular (i.e., dense) tissue in the breast as quantified in MR images can be predictive of the risk for developing breast cancer, especially for high-risk women.

Automated segmentation of the whole-breast as an organ from the other parts imaged is an important step in aiding lesion localization and fibroglandular tissue quantification. For this task, identifying the chest wall line (CWL) is most challenging due to image contrast variations, intensity discontinuity, and bias field.",

The atlas represents a pixel-wise likelihood of being fibroglandular tissue in the breast, which is derived by combining deformable image warping, using aligned breast contour points as landmarks, with a kernel density estimation technique. A mixture multivariate model is learned to characterize the breast tissue using MR image features, and the segmentation is subsequently based on examining the posterior probability where the learned atlas is incorporated as the prior probability. In our experiments, the algorithm-generated segmentation results of 10 cases are compared to the manual segmentations, verified by an experienced breast imaging radiologist, to assess the accuracy of the algorithm, where the Dice's Similarity Coefficient (DSC) shows a 0.85 agreement. The proposed automated segmentation method could be used to estimate the volumetric amount of fibroglandular tissue in the breast for breast cancer risk estimation.",

        "Abstract": "We present a methodological framework for multichannel Markov random fields (MRFs). We show that conditional independence allows loopy belief propagation to solve a multichannel MRF as a single channel MRF. We use conditional mutual information to search for features that satisfy conditional independence assumptions. Using this framework we incorporate kinetic feature maps derived from breast dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging as observation channels in MRF for tumor segmentation. Our algorithm based on multichannel MRF achieves an receiver operating characteristic area under curve (AUC) of 0.97 for tumor segmentation when using a radiologist's manual delineation as ground truth. Single channel MRF based on the best feature chosen from the same pool of features as used by the multichannel MRF achieved a lower AUC of 0.89. We also present a comparison against the well established normalized cuts segmentation algorithm along with commonly used approaches for breast tumor segmentation including fuzzy C-means (FCM) and the more recent method of running FCM on enhancement variance features (FCM-VES). These previous methods give a lower AUC of 0.92, 0.88, and 0.60, respectively. Finally, we also investigate the role of superior segmentation in feature extraction and tumor characterization. Specifically, we examine the effect of improved segmentation on predicting the probability of breast cancer recurrence as determined by a validated tumor gene expression assay. We demonstrate that an support vector machine classifier trained on kinetic statistics extracted from tumors as segmented by our algorithm gives a significant improvement in distinguishing between women with high and low recurrence risk, giving an AUC of 0.88 as compared to 0.79, 0.76, 0.75, and 0.66 when using normalized cuts, single channel MRF, FCM, and FCM-VES, respectively, for segmentation.",

        "Abstract": "The amount of fibroglandular tissue content in the breast as estimated mammographically, commonly referred to as breast percent density (PD%), is one of the most significant risk factors for developing breast cancer. Approaches to quantify breast density commonly focus on either semiautomated methods or visual assessment, both of which are highly subjective. Furthermore, most studies published to date investigating computer-aided assessment of breast PD% have been performed using digitized screen-film mammograms, while digital mammography is increasingly replacing screen-film mammography in breast cancer screening protocols. Digital mammography imaging generates two types of images for analysis, raw (i.e., \"FOR PROCESSING\") and vendor postprocessed (i.e., \"FOR PRESENTATION\"), of which postprocessed images are commonly used in clinical practice. Development of an algorithm which effectively estimates breast PD% in both raw and postprocessed digital mammography images would be beneficial in terms of direct clinical application and retrospective analysis.",

        "Abstract": "The relative fibroglandular tissue content in the breast, commonly referred to as breast density, has been shown to be the most significant risk factor for breast cancer after age. Currently, the most common approaches to quantify density are based on either semi-automated methods or visual assessment, both of which are highly subjective. This work presents a novel multi-class fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm for fully-automated identification and quantification of breast density, optimized for the imaging characteristics of digital mammography. The proposed algorithm involves adaptive FCM clustering based on an optimal number of clusters derived by the tissue properties of the specific mammogram, followed by generation of a final segmentation through cluster agglomeration using linear discriminant analysis. When evaluated on 80 bilateral screening digital mammograms, a strong correlation was observed between algorithm-estimated PD% and radiological ground-truth of r=0.83 (p<0.001) and an average Jaccard spatial similarity coefficient of 0.62. These results show promise for the clinical application of the algorithm in quantifying breast density in a repeatable manner.",

We prove that for making inference queries, any multichannel MRF can be reduced to a single channel MRF provided features in different channels are conditionally independent given the hidden variable, Using this result we incorporate kinetic feature maps derived from breast DCE MRI into the observation model of MRF for tumor segmentation. Our algorithm achieves an ROC AUC of 0.97 for tumor segmentation, We present a comparison against the commonly used approach of fuzzy C-means (FCM) and the more recent method of running FCM on enhancement variance features (FCM-VES).

        "Abstract": "We propose a multistep approach for representing and classifying tree-like structures in medical images. Tree-like structures are frequently encountered in biomedical contexts; examples are the bronchial system, the vascular topology, and the breast ductal network. We use tree encoding techniques, such as the depth-first string encoding and the PrUfer encoding, to obtain a symbolic string representation of the tree's branching topology; the problem of classifying trees is then reduced to string classification. We use the tf-idf text mining technique to assign a weight of significance to each string term (i.e., tree node label). Similarity searches and k-nearest neighbor classification of the trees is performed using the tf-idf weight vectors and the cosine similarity metric. We applied our approach to characterize the ductal tree-like parenchymal structure in X-ray galactograms, in order to distinguish among different radiological findings. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with classification accuracy reaching up to 86%, and also indicate that our method can potentially aid in providing insight to the relationship between branching patterns and function or pathology.",

        "Abstract": "Studies have demonstrated a relationship between mammographic parenchymal texture and breast cancer risk. Although promising, texture analysis in mammograms is limited by tissue superposition. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a novel tomographic x-ray breast imaging modality that alleviates the effect of tissue superposition, offering superior parenchymal texture visualization compared to mammography. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential advantages of DBT parenchymal texture analysis for breast cancer risk estimation.",

The method efficiently constructs a k-dimensional feature vector using concentric spheres in 3D (circles in 2D) radiating out of a region's center of mass. These signatures capture structural and internal volume properties. We evaluate our approach by performing experiments on classification and similarity searches, using artificial and real datasets. To generate artificial regions we introduce a region growth model. Similarity searches on artificial data demonstrate that our technique, although straightforward, compares favorably to mathematical morphology, while being two orders of magnitude faster. Experiments with real datasets show its effectiveness and general applicability.",
