        "Abstract": "The problem of clinical documentation burden is ever-growing. Electronic documentation tools such as \"dotphrases\" were invented to help with the documentation burden. Despite the ubiquity of these tools, they are understudied. We present work on the usage of dotphrases within the emergency department. We find that dotphrases are most often used by medical scribes, they significantly increase note length, and are completely unstandardized as to their naming conventions, content, and usage. We find that there is inconsistent usage across and within providers and that there is much duplication in the dotphrase content. We also show that dotphrases have no effect on the time to complete and cosign a note. Finally, we demonstrate that even when accounting for patient complexity upon presentation, note authorship, and note length - notes with higher dotphrase usage are billed at higher billing levels.",

        "Abstract": "Maternal morbidity and mortality have gained major attention recently, spurred on by rising domestic rates even as maternal mortality decreases in Europe. A major driver of morbidity and mortality among delivering women is postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). PPH is currently phenotyped using the subjective measure of 'Estimated blood loss' (EBL), which has been shown to be unreliable for tracking quality. Here we present a framework for phenotyping PPH into multiple severity levels, using a combination of data-driven techniques and expert-derived clinical indicators. We validate the framework by predicting large drops in hematocrit and quantitative blood loss, finding that the framework performs better in predicting coded PPH than a hematocrit-based predictor or predictors based on other metrics such as blood transfusions, and does better in predicting quantitative blood loss, a gold standard metric for blood loss that we have for a subset of patients, than any predictor we could build using hematocrit drops alone. In all, we present a principled framework that can be used to phenotype PPH in hospitals using readily available EHR data, and that will perform with more granularity and accuracy than existing methods.",

The long turnaround time of imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, are a major reason for delays in treatment and disposition. Over an eight-month pre-intervention period during which 10,063 CT scans were ordered in our emergency department, the average time from a CT order to the availability of the radiologist's final report was 5.9 hours (median=4.2 hours). We created a multi-disciplinary team of physicians, nurses, technicians, transporters, informaticians, and engineers to identify barriers and implement technical as well as human-factors solutions. In the corresponding eight-month period after the implementation of the intervention bundle, there was a 1.2 hour reduction in CT turnaround time, despite a 13.8% increase in the number of CT scans ordered (p<0.0001).",

        "Abstract": "Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are a common and serious healthcare-associated infection. Despite many efforts to reduce the occurrence of CAUTI, there remains a gap in the literature about CAUTI risk factors, especially pertaining to the effect of catheter dwell-time on CAUTI development and patient comorbidities.",
