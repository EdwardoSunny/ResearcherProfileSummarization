        "Title": "Exploring the Landscape of Aptamers: From Cross-Reactive to Selective to Specific, High-Affinity Receptors for Cocaine.",
        "Abstract": "We reported over 20 years ago MNS-4.1, the first DNA aptamer with a micromolar affinity for cocaine. MNS-4.1 is based on a structural motif that is very common in any random pool of oligonucleotides, and it is actually a nonspecific hydrophobic receptor with wide cross-reactivity with alkaloids and steroids. Despite such weaknesses preventing broad applications, this aptamer became widely used in proof-of-concept demonstrations of new formats of biosensors. We now report a series of progressively improved DNA aptamers recognizing cocaine, with the final optimized receptors having low nanomolar affinity and over a thousand-fold selectivity over the initial cross-reactants. In the process of optimization, we tested different methods to eliminate cross-reactivities and improve affinity, eventually achieving properties that are comparable to those of the reported monoclonal antibody candidates for the therapy of overdose. Multiple aptamers that we now report share structural motifs with the previously reported receptor for serotonin. Further mutagenesis studies revealed a palindromic, highly adaptable, broadly cross-reactive hydrophobic motif that could be rebuilt through mutagenesis, expansion of linker regions, and selections into receptors with exceptional affinities and varying specificities.",

        "Abstract": "Small molecules such as neurotransmitters are critical for biochemical functions in living systems. While conventional ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and mass spectrometry lack portability and are unsuitable for time-resolved measurements in situ, techniques such as amperometry and traditional field-effect detection require a large ensemble of molecules to reach detectable signal levels. Here we demonstrate the potential of carbon-nanotube-based single-molecule field-effect transistors (smFETs), which can detect the charge on a single molecule, as a new platform for recognizing and assaying small molecules. smFETs are formed by the covalent attachment of a probe molecule, in our case a DNA aptamer, to a carbon nanotube. Conformation changes on binding are manifest as discrete changes in the nanotube electrical conductance. By monitoring the kinetics of conformational changes in a binding aptamer, we show that smFETs can detect and quantify serotonin at the single-molecule level, providing unique insights into the dynamics of the aptamer-ligand system. In particular, we show the involvement of G-quadruplex formation and the disruption of the native hairpin structure in the conformational changes of the serotonin-aptamer complex. The smFET is a label-free approach to analysing molecular interactions at the single-molecule level with high temporal resolution, providing additional insights into complex biological processes.",

        "Abstract": "We can formulate mixtures of oligonucleotide-antibody conjugates to act as molecular cascade-based automata that analyze pairs of cell surface markers (CD markers) on individual cells in a manner consistent with the implementation of Boolean logic-for example, by producing a fluorescent label only if two markers are present. While traditional methods to characterize cells are based on transducing signals from individual cell surface markers, these cascades can be used to combine into a single signal the presence of two or even more CDs. In our original design, oligonucleotide components irreversibly flowed from one antibody to another, driven by increased hybridizations, leading to the magnitude of the final signal on each cell being determined by the surface marker that was the least abundant. This is a significant limitation to the precise labeling of narrow subpopulations, and, in order to overcome it, we changed our design to accomplish signal amplification to a more abundant cell surface marker. We show the AMPLIFY function on two examples: (1) we amplify the fluorescent label from the CD19 marker onto a fivefold more abundant CD45, and (2) we amplify broadly distributed CD45RA to a more constant marker, CD3. We expect this new function to enable the increasingly complex Boolean analysis of cell surfaces.",

        "Abstract": "Therapeutic antibodies that block viral entry have already proven to be important, first line drugs for treatments of viral infections. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, combinations of multiple therapeutic antibodies may need to be rapidly identified and formulated in a way that blocks each new, predominant variant of the virus. For efficient introduction of any new antibody combination into patients, it is important to be able to monitor patient-specific pharmacokinetics of individual antibodies, which would include the time course of their specific capacity to block the viral spike proteins. Here, we present three examples of microfluidic-based rapid isolation of companion reagents useful for establishing combination antibody therapies. These reagents are specific three-dimensional imprints of variable regions of individual human monoclonal antibodies against the -spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the form of oligonucleotide-based ligands (aptamers). We implement these anti-idiotypic aptamers as bioreceptors in graphene-based field-effect transistor sensors to accomplish label free, rapid, and sensitive detection of matching antibodies within minutes. Through this work we have demonstrated the general applicability of anti-idiotype aptamers as capture reagents in quantification of active forms of monoclonal antibodies in complex biological mixtures.",

        "Abstract": "Aptameric receptors are important biosensor components, yet our ability to identify them depends on the target structures. We analyzed the contributions of individual functional groups on small molecules to binding within 27 target-aptamer pairs, identifying potential hindrances to receptor isolation-for example, negative cooperativity between sterically hindered functional groups. To increase the probability of aptamer isolation for important targets, such as leucine and voriconazole, for which multiple previous selection attempts failed, we designed tailored strategies focused on overcoming individual structural barriers to successful selections. This approach enables us to move beyond standardized protocols into functional group-guided searches, relying on sequences common to receptors for targets and their analogs to serve as anchors in regions of vast oligonucleotide spaces wherein useful reagents are likely to be found.",

        "Abstract": "While monitoring expression of recombinant proteins is essential for obtaining high-quality biopharmaceutical and biotechnological products, existing assays for recombinant protein detection are laborious, time-consuming and expensive. This paper presents a microfluidic approach to rapid and cost-effective detection of tag-fused recombinant proteins via a dual-aptamer sandwich assay. Our approach addresses limitations in current methods for both dual-aptamer assays and generation of aptamers for such assays by first using microfluidic technology to isolate the aptamers rapidly and then employing these aptamers to implement a microfluidic dual-aptamer assay for tag-fused recombinant protein detection. The use of microfluidic technology enables the fast generation of aptamers and rapid detection of recombinant proteins with minimized consumption of reagents. In addition, compared with antibodies, aptamers as low-cost affinity reagents with an ability of reversible denaturation further decreases the cost of recombinant protein detection. For demonstration, an aptamer pair is isolated rapidly toward His-tagged IgE within two days, and then used in the microfluidic dual-aptamer assay for detecting His-tagged IgE in cell culture media within 10 min and with a limit of detection of 7.1 nM.",

        "Title": "Real-Time, Seconds-Resolved Measurements of Plasma Methotrexate In Situ in the Living Body.",
        "Abstract": "Dose-limiting toxicity and significant patient-to-patient pharmacokinetic variability often render it difficult to achieve the safe and effective dosing of drugs. This is further compounded by the slow, cumbersome nature of the analytical methods used to monitor patient-specific pharmacokinetics, which inevitably rely on blood draws followed by post-facto laboratory analysis. Motivated by the pressing need for improved \"therapeutic drug monitoring\", we are developing electrochemical aptamer-based (EAB) sensors, a minimally invasive biosensor architecture that can provide real-time, seconds-resolved measurements of drug levels in situ in the living body. A key advantage of EAB sensors is that they are generalizable to the detection of a wide range of therapeutic agents because they are independent of the chemical or enzymatic reactivity of their targets. Three of the four therapeutic drug classes that have, to date, been shown measurable using in vivo EAB sensors, however, bind to nucleic acids as part of their mode of action, leaving open questions regarding the extent to which the approach can be generalized to therapeutics that do not. Here, we demonstrate real-time, in vivo measurements of plasma methotrexate, an antimetabolite (a mode of action not reliant on DNA binding) chemotherapeutic, following human-relevant dosing in a live rat animal model. By providing hundreds of drug concentration values, the resulting seconds-resolved measurements succeed in defining key pharmacokinetic parameters, including the drug's elimination rate, peak plasma concentration, and exposure (area under the curve), with unprecedented 5 to 10% precision. With this level of precision, we easily identify significant (>2-fold) differences in drug exposure occurring between even healthy rats given the same mass-adjusted methotrexate dose. By providing a real-time, seconds-resolved window into methotrexate pharmacokinetics, such measurements can be used to precisely \"individualize\" the dosing of this significantly toxic yet vitally important chemotherapeutic.",

        "Abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a bone marrow cancer of resident plasma cells that affects 125,000 patients in the U.S. with about 30,000 new cases per year. Its signature is the clonal proliferation of a single plasma cell that secretes a patient specific monoclonal immunoglobulin (M-Ig). Targeting the M-Ig in patient serum could allow sensitive and noninvasive identification of minimal residual disease in multiple myeloma. Aptamers, which are single-stranded oligonucleotides with affinity and specificity to a target molecule, have recently been introduced as affinity reagents for recognition of MM M-Igs. Here we exploit microfluidic SELEX technology to enable rapid and efficient generation of aptamers against M-Ig proteins from MM patients. We first characterize the technology by isolating aptamers with affinity towards the monoclonal antibody rituximab as a model M-Ig and then apply the technology to isolating aptamers specifically targeting M-Igs obtained from serum samples of MM patients. We demonstrate that high-affinity DNA aptamers (K",

        "Title": "Using Spectroscopy to Guide the Adaptation of Aptamers into Electrochemical Aptamer-Based Sensors.",
        "Abstract": "Electrochemical aptamer-based (EAB) sensors utilize the binding-induced conformational change of an electrode-attached, redox-reporter-modified aptamer to transduce target recognition into an easily measurable electrochemical output. Because this signal transduction mechanism is single-step and rapidly reversible, EAB sensors support high-frequency, real-time molecular measurements, and because it recapitulates the reagentless, conformation-linked signaling seen in vivo among naturally occurring receptors, EAB sensors are selective enough to work in the complex, time-varying environments found in the living body. The fabrication of EAB sensors, however, requires that their target-recognizing aptamer be modified such that (1) it undergoes the necessary binding-induced conformational change and (2) that the thermodynamics of this \"conformational switch\" are tuned to ensure that they reflect an acceptable trade-off between affinity and signal gain. That is, even if an \"as-selected\" aptamer achieves useful affinity and specificity, it may fail when adapted to the EAB platform because it lacks the binding-induced conformational change required to support EAB signaling. In this paper we reveal the spectroscopy-guided approaches we use to modify aptamers such that they support the necessary binding-induced conformational change. Specifically, using newly reported aptamers, we demonstrate the systematic design of EAB sensors achieving clinically and physiologically relevant specificity, limits of detection, and dynamic range against the targets methotrexate and tryptophan.",

        "Abstract": "Binding between streptavidin, or its homologues, to biotin is one of the most widely exploited biological interactions in the biomedical sciences. Controlling the extent of biotinylation is important for meeting the requirements of the intended design and to preserve the native function of the biotin recipient. Within the protein world, a\"trial-and-error\" optimization approach toward biotinylation reaction conditions is often necessary due to widely varying properties of proteins. Therefore, product analysis is important. We show here that a oligonucleotide-blocked streptavidin, effectively \"monovalent streptavidin\", can tag biotin moieties individually and the tagged products visualized via a polyacrylamide gel shift assay to reveal the product ",

Chronic pain is the leading cause of disability in the world, is associated with multiple psychiatric comorbidities, and has been causally linked to the opioid crisis. Access to pain treatment has been called a fundamental human right by numerous organizations. The current COVID-19 pandemic has strained medical resources, creating a dilemma for physicians charged with the responsibility to limit spread of the contagion and to treat the patients they are entrusted to care for.",

        "Abstract": "Digital health promises a paradigm shift for medicine where biomarkers in individuals are continuously monitored to improve diagnosis and treatment of disease. To that end, a technology for minimally invasive quantification of endogenous analytes in bodily fluids will be required. Here, we describe a strategy for designing and fabricating hydrogel microfilaments that can penetrate the skin while allowing for optical fluorescence sensing. The polyacrylamide formulation was selected to provide high elastic modulus in the dehydrated state and optical transparency in the hydrated state. The microfilaments can be covalently tethered to a fluorescent aptamer to enable functional sensing. The microfilament array can penetrate the skin with low pain and without breaking, contact the dermal interstitial fluid, and be easily removed from the skin. In the future, hydrogel microfilaments could be integrated with a wearable fluorometer to serve as a platform for continuous, minimally invasive monitoring of intradermal biomarkers.",

        "Abstract": "Determination of the amino acid phenylalanine is important for lifelong disease management in patients with phenylketonuria, a genetic disorder in which phenylalanine accumulates and persists at levels that alter brain development and cause permanent neurological damage and cognitive dysfunction. Recent approaches for treating phenylketonuria focus on injectable medications that efficiently break down phenylalanine but sometimes result in detrimentally low phenylalanine levels. We have identified new DNA aptamers for phenylalanine in two formats, initially as fluorescent sensors and then, incorporated with field-effect transistors (FETs). Aptamer-FET sensors detected phenylalanine over a wide range of concentrations (fM to mM). ",

        "Title": "Electrochemical Aptamer-Based Sensors for Improved Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and High-Precision, Feedback-Controlled Drug Delivery.",
        "Abstract": "The electrochemical aptamer-based (E-AB) sensing platform appears to be a convenient (rapid, single-step, and calibration-free) and modular approach to measure concentrations of specific molecules (irrespective of their chemical reactivity) directly in blood and even in situ in the living body. Given these attributes, the platform may thus provide significant opportunities to render therapeutic drug monitoring (the clinical practice in which dosing is adjusted in response to plasma drug measurements) as frequent and convenient as the measurement of blood sugar has become for diabetics. The ability to measure arbitrary molecules in the body in real time could even enable closed-loop feedback control over plasma drug levels in a manner analogous to the recently commercialized controlled blood sugar systems. As initial exploration of this, we describe here the selection of an aptamer against vancomycin, a narrow therapeutic window antibiotic for which therapeutic monitoring is a critical part of the standard of care, and its adaptation into an electrochemical aptamer-based (E-AB) sensor. Using this sensor, we then demonstrate: (i) rapid (seconds) and convenient (single-step and calibration-free) measurement of plasma vancomycin in finger-prick-scale samples of whole blood, (ii) high-precision measurement of subject-specific vancomycin pharmacokinetics (in a rat animal model), and (iii) high-precision, closed-loop feedback control over plasma levels of the drug (in a rat animal model). The ability to not only track (with continuous-glucose-monitor-like measurement frequency and convenience) but also actively control plasma drug levels provides an unprecedented route toward improving therapeutic drug monitoring and, more generally, the personalized, high-precision delivery of pharmacological interventions.",

        "Abstract": "Physical isolation of molecular computing elements holds the potential for increasing system complexity by enabling the reuse of standardized components and by protecting the components from environmental degradation. However, once elements have been compartmentalized, methods for communicating into these compartments are needed. We report the compartmentalization of steroid-responsive DNA aptamers within giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) that are permeable to steroid inputs. Monodisperse GUVs are loaded with aptamers using a microfluidic platform. We demonstrate the target-specific activation of individual aptamers within the GUVs and then load two noninterfering aptamers into the same GUV and demonstrate specific responses to all possible combinations of the two input steroids. Crucially, GUVs prevent the degradation of DNA components by nucleases, providing a potential mechanism for deploying nucleic acid components in vivo. Importantly, our compartments also prevent nonspecific cross-talk between complementary strands, thereby providing a method for parallel execution of cross-reacting molecular logic components. Thus, we provide a mechanism for spatially organizing molecular computing elements, which will increase system modularity by allowing standardized components to be reused.",

We detected small molecules under physiological high-ionic strength conditions by modifying printed ultrathin metal-oxide field-effect transistor arrays with deoxyribonucleotide aptamers selected to bind their targets adaptively. Target-induced conformational changes of negatively charged aptamer phosphodiester backbones in close proximity to semiconductor channels gated conductance in physiological buffers, resulting in highly sensitive detection. Sensing of charged and electroneutral targets (serotonin, dopamine, glucose, and sphingosine-1-phosphate) was enabled by specifically isolated aptameric stem-loop receptors.",

        "Abstract": "Organophosphate compounds (OPCs) are commonly used as pesticides and were developed as nerve agents for chemical warfare. Exposure to OPCs results in toxicity due to their covalent binding and inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Treatment for toxicity due to OPC exposure has been largely focused on the reactivation of AChE by oxime-based compounds via direct nucleophilic attack on the phosphorous center. However, due to the disadvantages to existing oxime-based reactivators for treatment of OPC poisoning, we considered non-oxime mechanisms of reactivation. A high throughput screen of compound libraries was performed to discover previously unidentified reactivation compounds, followed by studies on their analogs. In the process, we discovered multiple non-oxime classes of compounds, the most robust of which we have already reported [1]. Herein, we report other classes of compounds we identified in our screen that are efficient at reactivation. During biochemical characterization, we also found some compounds with other activities that may inspire novel therapeutic approaches to OPC toxicity. Specifically, we found compounds that [1] increase the rate of substrate hydrolysis by AChE and, [2] protect the enzyme from inhibition by OPC. Further, we discovered that a subset of reactivator compounds recover activity from both AChE and the related enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). We now report these compounds, their activities and discuss how each relates to therapeutic approaches that would provide alternatives to traditional oxime-based reactivation.",

        "Abstract": "Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) offers a powerful method to isolate affinity oligonucleotides known as aptamers, which can then be used in a wide range of applications from drug delivery to biosensing. However, conventional SELEX methods rely on labor intensive and time consuming benchtop operations. A simplified microfluidic approach is presented which allows integration of the affinity selection and amplification stages of SELEX for the isolation of target-binding oligonucleotides by combining bead-based biochemical reactions with free solution electrokinetic oligonucleotide transfer. Free solution electrokinetics allows coupling of affinity selection and amplification for closed loop oligonucleotide enrichment without the need for offline processes, flow handling components or gel components, while bead based selection and amplification allow efficient manipulation of reagents and reaction products thereby realizing on-chip loop closure and integration of the entire SELEX process. Thus the approach is capable of multi-round enrichment of oligonucleotides using simple transfer processes while maintaining a high level of device integration, as demonstrated by the isolation of an aptamer pool against a protein target (IgA) with significantly higher binding affinity than the starting library in approximately 4 hours of processing time.",

The treatment options are limited, with unsatisfactory results from both conservative treatment and surgery. Multiple interventional therapies have been developed to treat discogenic pain, but most have not yet been validated by high quality studies.The best studied treatment for discogenic pain is the use of heat, which has been labeled as thermal intradiscal procedures (TIPs) by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). As the pathology is located in the annulus, we use the term thermal annular procedures (TAPs).",

The approach employs bead-based biochemical reactions in which affinity-selected target-binding oligonucleotides are electrokinetically transferred for amplification, while the amplification product is transferred back for affinity selection via pressure-driven fluid flow. The hybrid approach simplifies the device design and operation procedures by reduced pressure-driven flow control requirements and avoids the potentially deleterious exposure of targets to electric fields prior to and during affinity selection. In addition, bead-based reactions are used to achieve the on-chip coupling of affinity selection and amplification of target-binding oligonucleotides, thereby realizing on-chip loop closure and integration of the entire SELEX process without requiring offline procedures. The microfluidic approach is thus capable of closed-loop, multiround aptamer enrichment as demonstrated by selection of DNA aptamers against the protein immunoglobulin E with high affinity ( K",

        "Abstract": "We present a microfluidic approach to integrated isolation of DNA aptamers via systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). The approach employs a microbead-based protocol for the processes of affinity selection and amplification of target-binding oligonucleotides, and an electrophoretic DNA manipulation scheme for the coupling of these processes, which are required to occur in different buffers. This achieves the full microfluidic integration of SELEX, thereby enabling highly efficient isolation of aptamers in drastically reduced times and with minimized consumption of biological material. The approach as such also offers broad target applicability by allowing selection of aptamers with respect to targets that are either surface-immobilized or solution-borne, potentially allowing aptamers to be developed as readily available affinity reagents for a wide range of targets. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on two different procedures, respectively for isolating aptamers against a surface-immobilized protein (immunoglobulin E) and a solution-phase small molecule (bisboronic acid in the presence of glucose). In both cases aptamer candidates were isolated in three rounds of SELEX within a total process time of approximately 10\u2009hours.",

        "Abstract": "Occipital neuralgia (ON) is characterized by lancinating pain and tenderness overlying the occipital nerves. Both steroid injections and pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) are used to treat ON, but few clinical trials have evaluated efficacy, and no study has compared treatments. We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparative-effectiveness study in 81 participants with ON or migraine with occipital nerve tenderness whose aim was to determine which treatment is superior. Forty-two participants were randomized to receive local anesthetic and saline, and three 120 second cycles of PRF per targeted nerve, and 39 were randomized to receive local anesthetic mixed with deposteroid and 3 rounds of sham PRF. Patients, treating physicians, and evaluators were blinded to interventions. The PRF group experienced a greater reduction in the primary outcome measure, average occipital pain at 6 weeks (mean change from baseline -2.743 \u00b1 2.487 vs -1.377 \u00b1 1.970; P < 0.001), than the steroid group, which persisted through the 6-month follow-up. Comparable benefits favoring PRF were obtained for worst occipital pain through 3 months (mean change from baseline -1.925 \u00b1 3.204 vs -0.541 \u00b1 2.644; P = 0.043), and average overall headache pain through 6 weeks (mean change from baseline -2.738 \u00b1 2.753 vs -1.120 \u00b1 2.1; P = 0.037). Adverse events were similar between groups, and few significant differences were noted for nonpain outcomes. We conclude that although PRF can provide greater pain relief for ON and migraine with occipital nerve tenderness than steroid injections, the superior analgesia may not be accompanied by comparable improvement on other outcome measures.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents a microfluidic chip capable of isolating thermally sensitive protein-binding aptamer candidates. The chip makes use of bead-immobilized target molecules and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) sequences to enable a simplified chip design, in which affinity selection and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification of target-binding sequences occur in temperature-controlled microchambers. Using pressure-driven flow, buffer containing single-stranded DNA molecules with randomized sequences is cycled through a series of affinity selection and PCR amplification steps on microbeads. Successive introduction of the sample to each chamber effects a process of competition whereby DNA strands with weak binding strength to target molecules are rejected in favor of strongly binding sequences. Using bead-based PCR, the amplification step was miniaturized and integrated with affinity selection, resulting in significant reductions in process time and reagent use. As a demonstration, temperature-dependent selection and amplification of single-stranded oligonucleotides that bind to human Immuno-globulin E (IgE) was performed in 4 h, a 20-fold reduction in process time as compared to conventional methods that would require approximately a week. Fluorescent binding assays then demonstrated that the desired temperature specificity was imparted to the aptamer candidates within just one round of selection, and within two rounds the aptamer candidates exhibited enhanced affinity toward IgE.",

        "Abstract": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) that has been covalently inhibited by organophosphate compounds (OPCs), such as nerve agents and pesticides, has traditionally been reactivated by using nucleophilic oximes. There is, however, a clearly recognized need for new classes of compounds with the ability to reactivate inhibited AChE with improved in vivo efficacy. Here we describe our discovery of new functional groups--Mannich phenols and general bases--that are capable of reactivating OPC--inhibited AChE more efficiently than standard oximes and we describe the cooperative mechanism by which these functionalities are delivered to the active site. These discoveries, supported by preliminary in vivo results and crystallographic data, significantly broaden the available approaches for reactivation of AChE.",

        "Abstract": "Oligonucleotide-based receptors or aptamers can interact with small molecules, but the ability to achieve high-affinity and specificity of these interactions depends strongly on functional groups or epitopes displayed by the binding targets. Some classes of targets are particularly challenging: for example, monosaccharides have scarce functionalities and no aptamers have been reported to recognize, let alone distinguish from each other, glucose and other hexoses. Here we report aptamers that differentiate low-epitope targets such as glucose, fructose or galactose by forming ternary complexes with high-epitope organic receptors for monosaccharides. In a follow-up example, we expand this method to isolate high-affinity oligonucleotides against aromatic amino acids complexed in situ with a nonspecific organometallic receptor. The method is general and enables broad clinical use of aptamers for the detection of small molecules in mix-and-measure assays, as demonstrated by monitoring postprandial waves of phenylalanine in human subjects.",

        "Abstract": "Isolation of cells from heterogeneous biological samples is critical in both basic biological research and clinical diagnostics. Affinity-based methods, such as those that recognise cells by binding antibodies to cell membrane biomarkers, can be used to achieve specific cell isolation. Microfluidic techniques have been employed to achieve more efficient and effective cell isolation. By employing aptamers as surface-immobilised ligands, cells can be easily released and collected after specific capture. However, these methods still have limitations in cell release efficiency and spatial selectivity. This study presents an aptamer-based microfluidic device that not only achieves specific affinity cell capture, but also enables spatially selective temperature-mediated release and retrieval of cells without detectable damage. The specific cell capture is realised by using surface-patterned aptamers in a microchamber on a temperature-control chip. Spatially selective cell release is achieved by utilising a group of microheater and temperature sensor that restricts temperature changes, and therefore the disruption of cell-aptamer interactions, to a design-specified region. Experimental results with CCRF-CEM cells and sgc8c aptamers have demonstrated the specific cell capture and temperature-mediated release of selected groups of cells with negligible disruption to their viability.",

        "Abstract": "CONSPECTUS: The successes of electronic digital logic have transformed every aspect of human life over the last half-century. The word \"computer\" now signifies a ubiquitous electronic device, rather than a human occupation. Yet evidently humans, large assemblies of molecules, can compute, and it has been a thrilling challenge to develop smaller, simpler, synthetic assemblies of molecules that can do useful computation. When we say that molecules compute, what we usually mean is that such molecules respond to certain inputs, for example, the presence or absence of other molecules, in a precisely defined but potentially complex fashion. The simplest way for a chemist to think about computing molecules is as sensors that can integrate the presence or absence of multiple analytes into a change in a single reporting property. Here we review several forms of molecular computing developed in our laboratories. When we began our work, combinatorial approaches to using DNA for computing were used to search for solutions to constraint satisfaction problems. We chose to work instead on logic circuits, building bottom-up from units based on catalytic nucleic acids, focusing on DNA secondary structures in the design of individual circuit elements, and reserving the combinatorial opportunities of DNA for the representation of multiple signals propagating in a large circuit. Such circuit design directly corresponds to the intuition about sensors transforming the detection of analytes into reporting properties. While this approach was unusual at the time, it has been adopted since by other groups working on biomolecular computing with different nucleic acid chemistries. We created logic gates by modularly combining deoxyribozymes (DNA-based enzymes cleaving or combining other oligonucleotides), in the role of reporting elements, with stem-loops as input detection elements. For instance, a deoxyribozyme that normally exhibits an oligonucleotide substrate recognition region is modified such that a stem-loop closes onto the substrate recognition region, making it unavailable for the substrate and thus rendering the deoxyribozyme inactive. But a conformational change can then be induced by an input oligonucleotide, complementary to the loop, to open the stem, allow the substrate to bind, and allow its cleavage to proceed, which is eventually reported via fluorescence. In this Account, several designs of this form are reviewed, along with their application in the construction of large circuits that exhibited complex logical and temporal relationships between the inputs and the outputs. Intelligent (in the sense of being capable of nontrivial information processing) theranostic (therapy + diagnostic) applications have always been the ultimate motivation for developing computing (i.e., decision-making) circuits, and we review our experiments with logic-gate elements bound to cell surfaces that evaluate the proximal presence of multiple markers on lymphocytes.",

Strands of ssDNA in a randomized mixture are captured via specific binding onto target-functionalized microbeads in a microchamber. The strands are further separated from impurities and enriched on-chip via electrophoresis. The microchip consists of two microchambers that are connected by a channel filled with agarose gel. In the isolation chamber, beads functionalized with human immunoglobulin E (IgE) are retained by a weir structure. An integrated heater elevates the temperature in the chamber to elute desired ssDNA from the beads, and electrophoretic transport of the DNA through the gel to the second chamber is accomplished by applying an electric potential difference between the two chambers. Experimental results show that ssDNA expressing binding affinity to IgE was captured and enriched from a sample of ssDNA with random sequences, demonstrating the potential of the microchip to enhance the sensitivity of ssDNA detection methods in dilute and complex biological samples.",

The one-step process is based on a (tris)biotinylated-oligonucleotide blocking three of streptavidin\u2019s four biotin binding sites.

We leverage the ability of bead-based PCR to accumulate fluorescent labels following DNA amplification to explore a novel DNA detection scheme on a microchip. The microchip uses an integrated microheater and temperature sensor for rapid control of thermal cycling temperatures, while the sample is held in a microchamber fabricated from (poly)dimethylsiloxane and coated with Parylene. The effects of key bead-based PCR parameters, including annealing temperature and concentration of microbeads in the reaction mixture, are studied to achieve optimized device sensitivity and detection time.

        "Abstract": "Isolation of cells from heterogeneous mixtures is critically important in both basic cell biology studies and clinical diagnostics. Cell isolation can be realized based on physical properties such as size, density and electrical properties. Alternatively, affinity binding of target cells by surface-immobilized ligands, such as antibodies, can be used to achieve specific cell isolation. Microfluidics technology has recently been used in conjunction with antibody-based affinity isolation methods to capture, purify and isolate cells with higher yield rates, better efficiencies and lower costs. However, a method that allows easy release and collection of live cells from affinity surfaces for subsequent analysis and detection has yet to be developed. This paper presents a microfluidic device that not only achieves specific affinity capture and enrichment, but also enables non-destructive, temperature-mediated release and retrieval of cells. Specific cell capture is achieved using surface-immobilized aptamers in a microchamber. Release of the captured cells is realized by a moderate temperature change, effected via integrated heaters and a temperature sensor, to reversibly disrupt the cell-aptamer interaction. Experimental results with CCRF-CEM cells have demonstrated that the device is capable of specific capture and temperature-mediated release of cells, that the released cells remain viable and that the aptamer-functionalized surface is regenerable.",

The individual sensors were mined from this pool under separate selection pressures to interact with four steroids, while allowing cross-reactivity, in a manner designed to achieve perfect classification of individual steroids. The resulting sensor array had three sensors and displayed discriminatory capacity between steroid classes over full ranges of concentrations. We propose that similar protocols can be used whenever we have two or more classes of samples, with individual classes being defined through gross differences in ratios of dominant families of responsive components.",

        "Abstract": "We present a microfluidic approach to characterizing temperature-dependent biomolecular interactions. Solvated L-arginine vasopressin (AVP) and its immobilized RNA aptamer (spiegelmer) were allowed to achieve equilibrium binding in a microchip at a series of selected temperatures. Unbound AVP were collected and analyzed with matrix-assisted laser desorption\u2215ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), yielding melting curves that reveal highly temperature-dependent zones in which affinity binding (36-45\u2009\u00b0C) or dissociation (25-33\u2009\u00b0C and 50-65\u2009\u00b0C) occurs. Additionally, temperature-dependent binding isotherms were constructed; from these, thermodynamic quantities involved in binding were extracted. The results illustrated a strong change in heat capacity of interaction for this system, suggesting a considerable thermodynamic influence controlling vasopressin-spiegelmer interaction.",

        "Abstract": "This paper demonstrates and systematically characterizes the enrichment of biomolecular compounds using aptamer-functionalized surfaces within a microfluidic device. The device consists of a microchamber packed with aptamer-functionalized microbeads and integrated with a microheater and temperature sensor to enable thermally controlled binding and release of biomolecules by the aptamer. We first present an equilibrium binding-based analytical model to understand the enrichment process. The characteristics of the aptamer-analyte binding and enrichment are then experimentally studied, using adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and a specific RNA aptamer as a model system. The temporal process of AMP binding to the aptamer is found to be primarily determined by the aptamer-AMP binding kinetics. The temporal process of aptamer-AMP dissociation at varying temperatures is also obtained and observed to occur relatively rapidly (< 2 s). The specificity of the enrichment is next confirmed by performing selective enrichment of AMP from a sample containing biomolecular impurities. Finally, we investigate the enrichment of AMP by either discrete or continuous introduction of a dilute sample into the microchamber, demonstrating enrichment factors ranging from 566 to 686\u00d7, which agree with predictions of the analytical model.",

        "Abstract": "Research at the interface between chemistry and cybernetics has led to reports of 'programmable molecules', but what does it mean to say 'we programmed a set of solution-phase molecules to do X'? A survey of recently implemented solution-phase circuitry indicates that this statement could be replaced with 'we pre-mixed a set of molecules to do X and functional subsets of X'. These hard-wired mixtures are then exposed to a set of molecular inputs, which can be interpreted as being keyed to human moves in a game, or as assertions of logical propositions. In nucleic acids-based systems, stemming from DNA computation, these inputs can be seen as generic oligonucleotides. Here, we report using reconfigurable nucleic acid catalyst-based units to build a multipurpose reprogrammable molecular automaton that goes beyond single-purpose 'hard-wired' molecular automata. The automaton covers all possible responses to two consecutive sets of four inputs (such as four first and four second moves for a generic set of trivial two-player two-move games). This is a model system for more general molecular field programmable gate array (FPGA)-like devices that can be programmed by example, which means that the operator need not have any knowledge of molecular computing methods.",

        "Abstract": "Traditional robots rely for their function on computing, to store internal representations of their goals and environment and to coordinate sensing and any actuation of components required in response. Moving robotics to the single-molecule level is possible in principle, but requires facing the limited ability of individual molecules to store complex information and programs. One strategy to overcome this problem is to use systems that can obtain complex behaviour from the interaction of simple robots with their environment. A first step in this direction was the development of DNA walkers, which have developed from being non-autonomous to being capable of directed but brief motion on one-dimensional tracks. Here we demonstrate that previously developed random walkers-so-called molecular spiders that comprise a streptavidin molecule as an inert 'body' and three deoxyribozymes as catalytic 'legs'-show elementary robotic behaviour when interacting with a precisely defined environment. Single-molecule microscopy observations confirm that such walkers achieve directional movement by sensing and modifying tracks of substrate molecules laid out on a two-dimensional DNA origami landscape. When using appropriately designed DNA origami, the molecular spiders autonomously carry out sequences of actions such as 'start', 'follow', 'turn' and 'stop'. We anticipate that this strategy will result in more complex robotic behaviour at the molecular level if additional control mechanisms are incorporated. One example might be interactions between multiple molecular robots leading to collective behaviour; another might be the ability to read and transform secondary cues on the DNA origami landscape as a means of implementing Turing-universal algorithmic behaviour.",

We recently described the use of cooled radiofrequency (RF) electrodes for performing lateral branch neurotomy to treat sacroiliac joint pain. The procedure involves lesioning the lateral branches of the posterior primary rami at S1-S3, and the L5 dorsal ramus (L5DR). While the cooled RF electrode has been adopted as a means for lesioning the lateral branches, conventional RF electrodes are used to lesion the L5DR. The objective of this technical report is to evaluate the acute safety of denervating the L5DR using cooled RF electrode.",

        "Abstract": "We present a microfluidic approach to characterizing temperature dependent biomolecular binding. A ligand and its affinity receptor, one of which is surface-immobilized and the other remaining in solution, are allowed to achieve equilibrium binding in a microchip at a series of selected temperatures. The unbound molecules in solution are subsequently collected and analyzed with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), yielding temperature dependent equilibrium binding profiles of the ligand-receptor system. As examples, the thermally dependent properties of equilibrium binding of adenosine monophosphate, platelet-derived growth factor and arginine vasopressin with their affinity nucleic acid aptamers were investigated. The binding profile obtained for each biomolecular system revealed highly temperature dependent zones in which affinity binding or dissociation occurs. These results demonstrate that our microfluidic approach, which does not use any molecular labeling groups, can potentially be used to characterize receptor-ligand binding for applications in biosensing, biomolecular purification, and drug development.",

        "Abstract": "The full understanding of dynamics of cellular processes hinges on the development of efficient and non-invasive labels for intracellular RNA species. Light-up aptamers binding fluorogenic ligands show promise as specific labels for RNA species containing those aptamers. Herein, we took advantage of existing, non-light-up aptamers against small molecules and demonstrated a new class of light-up probes in vitro. We synthesized two conjugates of thiazole orange dye to small molecules (GMP and AMP) and characterized in vitro their interactions with corresponding RNA aptamers. The conjugates preserved specific binding to aptamers while showing several 100-fold increase in fluorescence of the dye (the 'light-up' property). In the presence of free small molecules, conjugates can be displaced from aptamers serving also as fluorescent sensors. Our in vitro results provide the proof-of-concept that the small-molecule conjugates with light-up properties can serve as a general approach to label RNA sequences containing aptamers.",

We conclude that, while the performance of the TO dye displacement approach is not always predictable, it is still a simple and sensitive assay to detect binding between RNA aptamers and small molecules. In particular, we describe efficient assays for tobramycin and theophylline, with up to 90% displacement of TO observed, and we describe the first aptameric assay for cAMP.",

We present a case in which a patient received intrathecal morphine infusion, and then experienced a clinical course that may have involved hyperalgesia, toxicity, and/or withdrawal. The possible differential diagnosis of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, toxicity, and withdrawal, and its implications in clinical pain management, are discussed. This report demonstrates the complexity of treating patients with long-term continuous intrathecal opioids when modest adjustment of the intrathecal cocktail results in a paradoxical clinical course.",

The long bones and the lower extremities are predominantly affected, equally in males and females between 30 and 70 years of age. In the estimation of its biological behaviour, histological graduation (G), the surgical localization of the tumour (T) and the presence or absence of metastases (M), are very important. A tumour with low grade differentiation, with transosseal propagation and metastases, has a poor prognosis. Surgical resection-amputation, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the therapeutic methods of choice.",

One controversial explanation for these findings is that the most commonly used cutoff value for selecting patients for l-z (facet) joint RF denervation, greater than 50% pain relief after diagnostic blocks, is too low and hence responsible for the high failure rate.",

The sensors for our arrays were selected to maximize their differential responses to the two steroids most different in an arbitrarily chosen parameter named \"shape-length\". The arrays incorporated three previously unreported types of sensors identified through a massive screening effort: (1) three-way junction sensors with neutralized charges within junction; (2) \"self-aggregating sensors\"; and (3) sensors incorporating fluorophore directly in a three-way junction as a spacer. The arrays were tested on seven steroids and an alkaloid (cocaine) over a range of concentrations, and achieved 92-96% accuracy in class assignments, despite the close structural similarities between steroids.",

When exposed to a matrix covered at high densities with oligonucleotide substrates, these molecules diffuse through the matrix continuously cleaving the substrate at rates comparable to those of individual catalysts in solution. Rates of diffusion (movement), processivity, and resident times of assemblies can be controlled through the number of catalytic units and the length of substrate/product recognition regions. The assemblies were characterized at the ensemble level using surface plasmon resonance.",

        "Abstract": "Spinal cord stimulation is the most common mode of neuromodulation used in managing chronic low back pain. It is minimally invasive and reversible as opposed to nerve ablation. The basic scientific background of the initial spinal cord stimulation trials was based on the gate control theory of Melzack and Wall. It has been demonstrated in multiple studies that dorsal horn neuronal activity caused by peripheral noxious stimuli could be inhibited by concomitant stimulation of the dorsal columns. Various other mechanisms, which may play a significant role in the mechanism of action of spinal cord stimulation, include the suppressive effect of spinal cord stimulation on tactile allodynia, increased dorsal horn inhibitory action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), prevention or abolition of peripheral ischemia, and effects on human brain activity. Spinal cord stimulation is indicated in low back pain with radiculopathy, failed back surgery syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, peripheral vascular disease, and ischemic heart disease. There is substantial scientific evidence on the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation for treatment of low back and lower extremity pain of neuropathic nature. Clinical studies revealed a success rate of from 50% to 70% with spinal cord stimulation, with decreased pain intensity scores, functional improvement and decreased medication usage. This review discusses multiple aspects of spinal cord stimulation, including pathophysiology and mechanism of action, rationale, indications, technique, clinical effectiveness, and controversial aspects.",

The sum output consisted of four new deoxyribozyme-based logic gates: an ANDAND gate and three ANDNOTANDNOT gates. These gates required the design of a generic three-input deoxyribozyme-based logic gate that can use any three-way combination of activating or inactivating inputs. This generic gate design utilizes an additional inverting element that hybridizes to convert YES logic into NOT logic and vice versa. The system represents the first solution-phase, single test tube, enzymatic full adder and shows the complexity of control over molecular scale events that can be achieved with deoxyribozyme-based logic gates. Similar systems could be applied to control autonomous therapeutic and diagnostic devices.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to present some clinical and radiological manifestations of PNS in relation to bronchogenic carcinoma (BC) and to evaluate the usefulness of imaging findings in the diagnosis of asymptomatic BC. In the study group of 204 patients (146 male and 58 female) with proven bronchogenic carcinoma, PNS was present in 18 (8.62%) patients. The patients with PNS were divided into two groups. The first one consisted of 13 (72.2%) patients with symptoms related to primary tumours while the second one consisted of 5 (27.7%) patients with symptoms, at initial appearance, indicative of disorders of other organs and systems. The predominant disorder was Lambert-Eaton Syndrome, associated with small-cell carcinoma. Endocrine manifestations included: inappropriate antidiuretic hormone production syndrome (small-cell carcinoma), a gonadotropin effect with gynaecomastia and testicular atrophy (planocellular carcinoma, small-cell carcinoma), a case of Cushing Syndrome (small-cell carcinoma), and hypercalcaemia, due to the production of the parathyroid hormone-related peptide, which was associated with planocellular carcinoma. A rare case of bilateral exophthalmos was found as PNS at adenocarcinoma. Digital clubbing and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HO) were associated with planocellular and adenocarcinoma, while clubbing was much more common than HO, especially among women. The differences between the two groups were related to the time of PNS appearance. In the first group, PNS occurred late on in the illness, while in the second group, PNS preceded the diagnosis of BC. Alternatively, the disappearance of a clinical or a radiological manifestation of PNS after surgery or chemotherapy may be an indicator of an improvement in health or PNS may be the first sign of illness recurrence. Radiological manifestations of PNS in asymptomatic patients may serve as a useful screen for identifying primary BC. In symptomatic patients, it may be an indicator of a higher likelihood of metastatic disease.",

These sensors consist of: (a) a reporting domain, which signals the binding event of an analyte through binding to a fluorophore; (b) a recognition domain, which binds the analyte; and (c) a communication module, which serves as a conduit between recognition and signaling domains. We tested recognition regions specific for ATP, FMN, and theophylline in combinations with malachite green binding aptamer as a signaling domain. In each case, we were able to obtain a functional sensor capable of responding to an increase in analyte concentration with an increase in fluorescence. Similar constructs that consist only of natural RNA could be expressed in cells and used as sensors for intracellular imaging.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a molecular automaton, called MAYA, which encodes a version of the game of tic-tac-toe and interactively competes against a human opponent. The automaton is a Boolean network of deoxyribozymes that incorporates 23 molecular-scale logic gates and one constitutively active deoxyribozyme arrayed in nine wells (3x3) corresponding to the game board. To make a move, MAYA carries out an analysis of the input oligonucleotide keyed to a particular move by the human opponent and indicates a move by fluorescence signaling in a response well. The cycle of human player input and automaton response continues until there is a draw or a victory for the automaton. The automaton cannot be defeated because it implements a perfect strategy.",

        "Abstract": "We report herein a novel system for the parallel processing of molecular recognition events utilizing arrays of oligonucleotide-based fluorescent sensors to characterize hydrophobic molecules in solution. The binding domains of the sensors were based on three-way junctions that utilize double helical stems as framework regions to reliably fold regardless of variations in or around the binding domain. A reporting domain was introduced by the specific substitution of a single phosphodiester group with a phosphorothioate, followed by selective functionalization with a fluorophore. The sensors were organized into cross-reactive arrays to yield characteristic fingerprints for samples containing hydrophobic molecules. The fingerprints can be used to characterize steroids in solution, including complex biologically important fluids. Arrays have the potential for clinical applications such as the detection of gross errors in steroidogenesis.",

Two deoxyribozymes mimic i(1)ANDNOTi(2) and i(2)ANDNOTi(1) gates that cleave a fluorogenic substrate, reporting through an increase in fluorescence emission at 570 nm. The third deoxyribozyme mimics an i(1)ANDi(2) gate and cleaves the other fluorogenic substrate, reporting through an increase in fluorescence emission at 520 nm. Together, this system represents the first example of a decision-making enzymatic network with two inputs and two outputs.

        "Abstract": "Although epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are a common treatment for chronic pain conditions, it is not clear whether there is consensus on their technical aspects. The current literature suggests that variations in technical aspects may affect ESI outcomes. The goal of the survey was to help establish a standard frame of reference for the performance of ESIs. We analyzed survey results from 68 academic anesthesia programs and 28 private practices in the United States. The main finding in this survey is that there is no clear-cut consensus as to the ideal method to perform ESI. There is a wide variation among individual practices in almost every technical aspect of ESI. Private practices use significantly more fluoroscopy than academic centers. The large difference was found in the cervical region where 73% of private practices and only 39% of academic institutions polled perform the ESIs with fluoroscopic guidance (P = 0.005). A similar discrepancy was found in approaches to the epidural space after laminectomy where 61% of private practices, but only 15% of academic centers, use the transforaminal approach. The study results indicate that there is no consensus, and that there is a wide variation in current practices.",

        "Abstract": "We report herein a set of deoxyribozyme-based logic gates capable of generating any Boolean function. We construct basic NOT and AND gates, followed by the more complex XOR gate. These gates were constructed through a modular design that combines molecular beacon stem-loops with hammerhead-type deoxyribozymes. Importantly, as the gates have oligonucleotides as both inputs and output, they open the possibility of communication between various computation elements in solution. The operation of these gates is conveniently connected to a fluorescent readout.",
