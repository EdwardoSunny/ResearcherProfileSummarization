        "Title": "The stabilized supralinear network accounts for the contrast dependence of visual cortical gamma oscillations.",
        "Abstract": "When stimulated, neural populations in the visual cortex exhibit fast rhythmic activity with frequencies in the gamma band (30-80 Hz). The gamma rhythm manifests as a broad resonance peak in the power-spectrum of recorded local field potentials, which exhibits various stimulus dependencies. In particular, in macaque primary visual cortex (V1), the gamma peak frequency increases with increasing stimulus contrast. Moreover, this contrast dependence is local: when contrast varies smoothly over visual space, the gamma peak frequency in each cortical column is controlled by the local contrast in that column's receptive field. No parsimonious mechanistic explanation for these contrast dependencies of V1 gamma oscillations has been proposed. The stabilized supralinear network (SSN) is a mechanistic model of cortical circuits that has accounted for a range of visual cortical response nonlinearities and contextual modulations, as well as their contrast dependence. Here, we begin by showing that a reduced SSN model without retinotopy robustly captures the contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency, and provides a mechanistic explanation for this effect based on the observed non-saturating and supralinear input-output function of V1 neurons. Given this result, the local dependence on contrast can trivially be captured in a retinotopic SSN which however lacks horizontal synaptic connections between its cortical columns. However, long-range horizontal connections in V1 are in fact strong, and underlie contextual modulation effects such as surround suppression. We thus explored whether a retinotopically organized SSN model of V1 with strong excitatory horizontal connections can exhibit both surround suppression and the local contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency. We found that retinotopic SSNs can account for both effects, but only when the horizontal excitatory projections are composed of two components with different patterns of spatial fall-off with distance: a short-range component that only targets the source column, combined with a long-range component that targets columns neighboring the source column. We thus make a specific qualitative prediction for the spatial structure of horizontal connections in macaque V1, consistent with the columnar structure of cortex.",

        "Abstract": "Sub-additivity and variability are ubiquitous response motifs in the primary visual cortex (V1). Response sub-additivity enables the construction of useful interpretations of the visual environment, whereas response variability indicates\u00a0the factors that limit the precision with which the brain can do this. There is increasing evidence that experimental manipulations that elicit response sub-additivity often also quench response variability. Here, we provide an overview of these phenomena and suggest that they\u00a0may have common origins. We discuss empirical findings and recent model-based insights into the functional operations, computational objectives and circuit mechanisms underlying V1 activity. These different\u00a0modelling approaches all predict that response sub-additivity and variability quenching\u00a0often co-occur. The phenomenology of these two response motifs, as well as many of the insights obtained about them in V1, generalize to other cortical areas.\u00a0Thus, the connection between response sub-additivity and variability quenching may be a canonical motif across the cortex.",

The Hampton Veterans Affairs Medical Center's (HVAMC) rTMS clinic used H-coil for dTMS for Veterans with treatment-resistant depression and tracked symptomology at multiple times points up to six months post-treatment. Veterans underwent 30 session of dTMS treatment using the Hesed coil (H1 coil). The PHQ-9, PCL-5, and BSS were administered to Veterans at four time points: pretreatment, post-treatment, three months after treatment, and six months after treatment. In aggregate, there were clinically significant reductions in symptoms of depression (43.47%), PTSD (44.14%) and suicidal ideation (54.02%) at the six month follow-up relative to pretreatment. Results provide evidence of the impact and durability of dTMS on symptoms of MDD, PTSD, and suicidal ideation among Veterans with treatment-resistant depression.",

In a parallel trend, researchers have brought increased methodological rigour to their evaluation of these interventions. However, several methodological issues still constrain the quality and real-world relevance of the existing evidence base. We examine five core challenges in randomised controlled trials of mental health and psychosocial support interventions with conflict-affected and disaster-affected populations. These challenges are: translating intervention effects into metrics of real-world significance; giving adequate consideration to the selection and monitoring of control conditions; following rigorous processes to ensure outcome measures are culturally appropriate and psychometrically sound; ensuring and monitoring implementation variables, including fidelity, exposure, participant engagement, and the competence of implementation staff; and assessing mechanisms of change.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to optogenetically perturb neural circuits opens an unprecedented window into mechanisms governing circuit function. We analyzed and theoretically modeled neuronal responses to visual and optogenetic inputs in mouse and monkey V1. In both species, optogenetic stimulation of excitatory neurons strongly modulated the activity of single neurons yet had weak or no effects on the distribution of firing rates across the population. Thus, the optogenetic inputs reshuffled firing rates across the network. Key statistics of mouse and monkey responses lay on a continuum, with mice/monkeys occupying the low-/high-rate regions, respectively. We show that neuronal reshuffling emerges generically in randomly connected excitatory/inhibitory networks, provided the coupling strength (combination of recurrent coupling and external input) is sufficient that powerful inhibitory feedback cancels the mean optogenetic input. A more realistic model, distinguishing tuned visual vs. untuned optogenetic input in a structured network, reduces the coupling strength needed to explain reshuffling.",

        "Abstract": "Regional relative sea level rise is exacerbating flooding hazards in the coastal zone. In addition to changes in the ocean, vertical land motion (VLM) is a driver of spatial variation in sea level change that can either diminish or enhance flood risk. Here, we apply state-of-the-art interferometric synthetic aperture radar and global navigation satellite system time series analysis to estimate velocities and corresponding uncertainties at 30-m resolution in the New\u00a0York City metropolitan area, revealing VLM with unprecedented detail. We find broad subsidence of 1.6 mm/year, consistent with glacial isostatic adjustment to the melting of the former ice sheets, and previously undocumented hot spots of both subsidence and uplift that can be physically explained in some locations. Our results inform ongoing efforts to adapt to sea level rise and reveal points of VLM that motivate both future scientific investigations into surface geology and assessments of engineering projects.",

        "Title": "End-binding protein 1 promotes specific motor-cargo association in the cell body prior to axonal delivery of dense core vesicles.",
        "Abstract": "Axonal transport is key to neuronal function. Efficient transport requires specific motor-cargo association in the soma, yet the mechanisms regulating this early step remain poorly understood. We found that EBP-1, the C.\u00a0elegans ortholog of the canonical-microtubule-end-binding protein EB1, promotes the specific association between kinesin-3/KIF1A/UNC-104 and dense core vesicles (DCVs) prior to their axonal delivery. Using single-neuron, in\u00a0vivo labeling of endogenous cargo and EBs, we observed reduced axonal abundance and reduced secretion of DCV cargo, but not other KIF1A/UNC-104 cargoes, in ebp-1 mutants. This reduction could be traced back to fewer exit events from the cell body, where EBP-1 colocalized with the DCV sorting machinery at the trans Golgi, suggesting that this is the site of EBP-1 function. EBP-1 calponin homology (CH) domain was required for directing microtubule growth on the Golgi, and mammalian EB1 interacted with KIF1A in an EBH-domain-dependent manner. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments suggest a model in which both kinesin-3 binding and guidance of microtubule growth at the trans Golgi by EBP-1 promote motor-cargo association at sites of DCV biogenesis. In support of this model, tethering either EBP-1 or a kinesin-3/KIF1A/UNC-104-interacting domain from an unrelated protein to the Golgi restored the axonal abundance of DCV proteins in ebp-1 mutants. These results uncover an unexpected role for a microtubule-associated protein and provide insights into how specific kinesin-3 cargo is delivered to the axon.",

        "Abstract": "To identify the gait differences between cane and rolling walker (RW) use on incline and how these walking devices were received and used, 26 qualified older adults walked randomly on downward and upward with a cane and a RW respectively. With the RW use, downward walking show a faster velocity, higher cadence, less stance time, bigger steps and strides than upward walking (p\u2264.05); but no differences were seen with cane use. When comparing walking between a RW and a cane, those using a cane had faster velocity, larger step and stride lengths (P\u2264.01) but only during the upward condition. Incline surface plays a critical role in gait differences when walking with walking device. Geriatric professionals need to know the changes in gait that result from the type of device being used and need to incorporate this knowledge in the education provided to older adults for proper use of a walking device.",

        "Title": "The Case for Developing a Movement System Framework for Older Adults.",
        "Abstract": "Leaders and scholars from multiple academies of the American Physical Therapy Association are developing and defining movement system diagnoses to guide practice. However, there is no consensus on the need for or content of such frameworks. This Perspective describes current thought about movement system diagnoses in physical therapy and summarizes the work of the Academy of Geriatrics (APTA Geriatrics) Movement System Diagnosis Task Force (GMS-TF) as it contributes to the movement system diagnosis discussion within the profession. Initially convened to define movement system diagnostic labels unique to older adults, the GMS-TF's developmental process identified the need for a clearer diagnostic framework onto which specific diagnoses will later be added. Although The World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health model is a strong foundation for the patient-client management model, the GMS-TF proposes formal incorporation of the Geriatric 5Ms (mobility, medications, memory, multi-complexity, and \"what matters most\") into a movement system framework for older adults. The GMS-TF concurs with the APTA Academy of Neurology Movement System Task Force proposal that observation and analysis of key functional tasks are the foundation of any examination of older adults. The GMS-TF suggests adding several additional movement tasks that are important for older adults. The GMS-TF believes that this strategy highlights the health care needs of older adults and prioritizes physical therapist care for older adults with complex needs. This Perspective is the foundation for a future movement system diagnosis model for older adults that will complement and facilitate the development of models of care to be applied across the lifespan.",

        "Title": "The stabilized supralinear network accounts for the contrast dependence of visual cortical gamma oscillations.",
        "Abstract": "When stimulated, neural populations in the visual cortex exhibit fast rhythmic activity with frequencies in the gamma band (30-80 Hz). The gamma rhythm manifests as a broad resonance peak in the power-spectrum of recorded local field potentials, which exhibits various stimulus dependencies. In particular, in macaque primary visual cortex (V1), the gamma peak frequency increases with increasing stimulus contrast. Moreover, this contrast dependence is local: when contrast varies smoothly over visual space, the gamma peak frequency in each cortical column is controlled by the local contrast in that column's receptive field. No parsimonious mechanistic explanation for these contrast dependencies of V1 gamma oscillations has been proposed. The stabilized supralinear network (SSN) is a mechanistic model of cortical circuits that has accounted for a range of visual cortical response nonlinearities and contextual modulations, as well as their contrast dependence. Here, we begin by showing that a reduced SSN model without retinotopy robustly captures the contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency, and provides a mechanistic explanation for this effect based on the observed non-saturating and supralinear input-output function of V1 neurons. Given this result, the local dependence on contrast can trivially be captured in a retinotopic SSN which however lacks horizontal synaptic connections between its cortical columns. However, long-range horizontal connections in V1 are in fact strong, and underlie contextual modulation effects such as surround suppression. We thus explored whether a retinotopically organized SSN model of V1 with strong excitatory horizontal connections can exhibit both surround suppression and the local contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency. We found that retinotopic SSNs can account for both effects, but only when the horizontal excitatory projections are composed of two components with different patterns of spatial fall-off with distance: a short-range component that only targets the source column, combined with a long-range component that targets columns neighboring the source column. We thus make a specific qualitative prediction for the spatial structure of horizontal connections in macaque V1, consistent with the columnar structure of cortex.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who undergo lower extremity joint arthroplasty are rarely encountered. Patients with ALS are at an increased risk for perioperative anesthetic complications. Anesthetic techniques, regional or general, present different risks to patients with ALS. The historical concern of worsening pre-existing neurologic symptoms with regional anesthesia is being re-examined in light of emerging evidence supporting its use in patients with ALS. Here, we present the successful perioperative management of a patient with severe bulbar ALS undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Despite his advanced bulbar symptoms, he was independently ambulatory with severe knee pain related to osteoarthritis. During multidisciplinary planning with the patient and his wife, it became clear that his primary perioperative concern was avoiding intubation, prolonged ventilation, and tracheostomy placement. With this in mind, we planned for a neuraxial anesthetic without intraoperative sedation, a postoperative adductor canal peripheral nerve block, and multimodal non-opioid analgesia. There were no perioperative complications. At the six-week follow-up, he experienced improved ambulation and showed no signs of worsened ALS symptoms.",

The activity of deoxyalpinoid B and a known inducer of oxidative stress, sulforaphane, against Leishmania donovani and Leishmania infantatum are both reported for the first time. Both compounds exhibit potent antileishmanial activity against both species. We hypothesize that the activation of intracellular oxidative stress is a key molecular response for the inhibition of Leishmania.",

        "Abstract": "Heightened recognition of impacts to coastal salt marshes from sea-level rise has led to expanding interest in using thin-layer sediment placement (TLP) as an adaptation tool to enhance future marsh resilience. Building on successes and lessons learned from the Gulf and southeast U.S. coasts, projects are now underway in other regions, including New England where the effects of TLP on marsh ecosystems and processes are less clear. In this study, we report on early responses of a drowning, microtidal Rhode Island marsh (Ninigret Marsh, Charlestown, RI) to the application of a thick (10-48 cm) application of sandy dredged material and complimentary extensive adaptive management to quickly build elevation capital and enhance declining high marsh plant species. Physical changes occurred quickly. Elevation capital, rates of marsh elevation gain, and soil drainage all increased, while surface inundation, die-off areas, and surface ponding were greatly reduced. Much of the marsh revegetated within a few years, exhibiting aspects of classic successional processes leading to new expansive areas of high marsh species, although low marsh ",

The reasons for the research agenda for geriatric physical therapy are (1) to have a broad representation of the research conducted by physical therapist(s) working with older adults, (2) to provide guidance and assistance to emerging investigators to aid the trajectory of a research career, and (3) as a document to engage potential funding agencies, foundations, and individuals in support of physical therapist-conducted research. The design was based on the Research Agenda for Physical Therapy (APTA document), formatted to be consistent with the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, priority ratings for the research statements, and specific examples of research questions for each category of the Research Agenda. The Academy of Geriatric Physical Therapy Research Agenda generated to be a living document, with revisions to research questions and priority ratings expected in the future to enable the agenda to adapt to changes in science, practice, workforce, education, and health policy.",

        "Abstract": "Geriatric physical therapy requires a unique skill set and knowledge to provide best practice care. The skill set requires clinicians to recognize the significance of the continuum of aging from optimal to pathology-influenced aging and how psychosocial, environmental, behavioral, accessibility, and economic factors affect this aging continuum, optimal health, and wellness. Employing this distinctive skill set while also utilizing evidence-based practice, acknowledging the variability observed in older adults, and utilizing interwoven care systems that impact outcomes are key characteristics of best practice. The Academy of Geriatric Physical Therapy developed best practice guidelines consisting of 6 principles needed to ensure patients receive the care that they deserve. Best practice principles include person-centered care, anti-ageist beliefs, holistic assessment using sound outcome measures, evidence-based interventions, physical activity promotion, and interprofessional collaborative practice. This executive summary presents these principles along with suggested action steps for each element of best practice. The aims are to encourage individual self-assessment, promote improvement in practice on an individual and facility/system level, increase communication and collaboration with other health care providers about global best practices for older adults, and to further target education, resources, and advocacy toward achieving best practice on a larger scale.",

        "Abstract": "Mangroves sequester significant quantities of organic carbon (C) because of high rates of burial in the soil and storage in biomass. We estimated mangrove forest C storage and accumulation rates in aboveground and belowground components among five sites along an urbanization gradient in the San Juan Bay Estuary, Puerto Rico. Sites included the highly urbanized and clogged Ca\u00f1o Martin Pe\u00f1a in the western half of the estuary, a series of lagoons in the center of the estuary, and a tropical forest reserve (Pi\u00f1ones) in the easternmost part. Radiometrically dated cores were used to determine sediment accretion and soil C storage and burial rates. Measurements of tree dendrometers coupled with allometric equations were used to estimate aboveground biomass. Estuary-wide mangrove forest C storage and accumulation rates were estimated using interpolation methods and coastal vegetation cover data. In recent decades (1970-2016), the highly urbanized Martin Pe\u00f1a East (MPE) site with low flushing had the highest C storage and burial rates among sites. The MPE soil carbon burial rate was over twice as great as global estimates. Mangrove forest C burial rates in recent decades were significantly greater than historic decades (1930-1970) at Ca\u00f1no Martin Pe\u00f1a and Pi\u00f1ones. Although MPE and Pi\u00f1ones had similarly low flushing, the landscape settings (clogged canal vs forest reserve) and urbanization (high vs low) were different. Apparently, not only urbanization, but site-specific flushing patterns, landscape setting, and soil fertility affected soil C storage and burial rates. There was no difference in C burial rates between historic and recent decades at the San Jos\u00e9 and La Torrecilla lagoons. Mangrove forests had soil C burial rates ranging from 88 g m",

        "Abstract": "Tropical mangrove forests have been described as \"coastal kidneys,\" promoting sediment deposition and filtering contaminants, including excess nutrients. Coastal areas throughout the world are experiencing increased human activities, resulting in altered geomorphology, hydrology, and nutrient inputs. To effectively manage and sustain coastal mangroves, it is important to understand nitrogen (N) storage and accumulation in systems where human activities are causing rapid changes in N inputs and cycling. We examined N storage and accumulation rates in recent (1970 - 2016) and historic (1930 - 1970) decades in the context of urbanization in the San Juan Bay Estuary (SJBE, Puerto Rico), using mangrove soil cores that were radiometrically dated. Local anthropogenic stressors can alter N storage rates in peri-urban mangrove systems either directly by increasing N soil fertility or indirectly by altering hydrology (e.g., dredging, filling, and canalization). Nitrogen accumulation rates were greater in recent decades than historic decades at Pi\u00f1ones Forest and Martin Pe\u00f1a East. Martin Pe\u00f1a East was characterized by high urbanization, and Pi\u00f1ones, by the least urbanization in the SJBE. The mangrove forest at Martin Pe\u00f1a East fringed a poorly drained canal and often received raw sewage inputs, with N accumulation rates ranging from 17.7 to 37.9 g ",

The mass is composed of primitive myeloid cells that can occur in a variety of organs, most commonly the skin, lymph nodes, GI tract, bone, breast, and CNS. Involvement of the genitourinary tract is rare. Consensus on treatment of MS has not been established, but management typically involves systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant as well as palliative local therapies such as radiation or surgery. Outcomes of MS using novel AML therapies, such as BCL-2 inhibitors or IDH inhibitors, remain undescribed. We describe a rare case of a 70-year-old man presenting with MS of the urinary bladder complicating known secondary AML (RUNX1 and IDH2 mutated). Prior to development of bladder MS, the patient had received decitabine, enasidenib, and venetoclax. Following diagnosis, he was treated with cytarabine and venetoclax. To our knowledge, this is the first case of bladder MS treated with a BCL-2 inhibitor.",

        "Abstract": "Easy-to-use and inexpensive techniques are needed to determine the site-specific production of inflammatory mediators and neurotrophins during skin injury, inflammation, and/or sensitization. The goal of this study is to describe an epidermal-dermal separation protocol using thermolysin, a proteinase that is active at 4 \u00b0C. To illustrate this procedure, Sprague Dawley rats are anesthetized, and right hind paws are injected with carrageenan. Six and twelve hours after injection, rats with inflammation and na\u00efve rats are euthanized, and a piece of hind paw, glabrous skin is placed in cold Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium. The epidermis is then separated at the basement membrane from the dermis by thermolysin in PBS with calcium chloride. Next, the dermis is secured by microdissection forceps, and the epidermis is gently teased away. Toluidine blue staining of tissue sections show that the epidermis is separated cleanly from the dermis at the basement membrane. All keratinocyte cell layers remain intact, and the epidermal rete ridges along with indentations from dermal papillae are clearly observed. Qualitative and real-time RT-PCR is used to determine nerve growth factor and interleukin-6 expression levels. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry are finally performed to detect amounts of nerve growth factor. This report illustrates that cold thermolysin digestion is an effective method to separate epidermis from dermis for evaluation of mRNA and protein alterations during inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "Many studies have shown that the excitation and inhibition received by cortical neurons remain roughly balanced across many conditions. A key question for understanding the dynamical regime of cortex is the nature of this balancing. Theorists have shown that network dynamics can yield systematic cancellation of most of a neuron's excitatory input by inhibition. We review a wide range of evidence pointing to this cancellation occurring in a regime in which the balance is loose, meaning that the net input remaining after cancellation of excitation and inhibition is comparable in size with the factors that cancel, rather than tight, meaning that the net input is very small relative to the canceling factors. This choice of regime has important implications for cortical functional responses, as we describe: loose balance, but not tight balance, can yield many nonlinear population behaviors seen in sensory cortical neurons, allow the presence of correlated variability, and yield decrease of that variability with increasing external stimulus drive as observed across multiple cortical areas.",

        "Abstract": "Fish contaminant studies with human health protection objectives typically focus on muscle tissue, recognizing that fillets are the commonly consumed tissue fraction. Muscle biopsy punch sampling for mercury analysis has recently been used as an alternative to harvesting fish for fillets; however, there is limited information comparing fillet plug results to whole fillet results. This study was conducted to address that data gap and to test the applicability of plugs for monitoring associated with United States Environmental Protection Agency's fish tissue-based mercury and selenium water quality criteria. The mercury phase included 300 fillet homogenates and 300 field-extracted plug samples from 60 fish, and the selenium phase included 120 fillet homogenates and 120 plugs from 30 fish. Both phases showed that there were no statistically significant differences between fillet plug and homogenized fillet results at the community level; however, a selenium plug monitoring alternative must employ a sufficiently sensitive analytical method and consider total solids. Plug and fillet sampling alternatives have inherent advantages and disadvantages. Fillet sampling provides sufficient mass to consider multiple contaminants but requires fish to be harvested. Plug sampling only provides adequate mass for a single analyte but may allow fish survival, although additional research is needed on survival following plug removal.",

        "Title": "Interrogating theoretical models of neural computation with emergent property inference.",
        "Abstract": "A cornerstone of theoretical neuroscience is the circuit model: a system of equations that captures a hypothesized neural mechanism. Such models are valuable when they give rise to an experimentally observed phenomenon -- whether behavioral or a pattern of neural activity -- and thus can offer insights into neural computation. The operation of these circuits, like all models, critically depends on the choice of model parameters. A key step is then to identify the model parameters consistent with observed phenomena: to solve the inverse problem. In this work, we present a novel technique, emergent property inference (EPI), that brings the modern probabilistic modeling toolkit to theoretical neuroscience. When theorizing circuit models, theoreticians predominantly focus on reproducing computational properties rather than a particular dataset. Our method uses deep neural networks to learn parameter distributions with these computational properties. This methodology is introduced through a motivational example of parameter inference in the stomatogastric ganglion. EPI is then shown to allow precise control over the behavior of inferred parameters and to scale in parameter dimension better than alternative techniques. In the remainder of this work, we present novel theoretical findings in models of primary visual cortex and superior colliculus, which were gained through the examination of complex parametric structure captured by EPI. Beyond its scientific contribution, this work illustrates the variety of analyses possible once deep learning is harnessed towards solving theoretical inverse problems.",

        "Abstract": "Sickle cell hepatopathy is a well-described but uncommonly seen complication of sickle cell disease and is usually caused by multiple overlapping processes. A more acute liver complication is hepatic sequestration which is important to recognize in order to initiate life-saving treatment.\u202fA 33-year-old woman with sickle cell disease complicated by painful crises, splenic infarction and significant alcohol abuse presented\u00a0with gastrointestinal distress, pain crisis, acute-on-chronic anemia, and hyperbilirubinemia in the setting of greater than baseline alcohol consumption. She was found to have hepatomegaly, encephalopathy, severe jaundice, and severe hyperbilirubinemia. She was treated with red cell exchange and supportive care which resulted in an improvement in her symptoms as well as hyperbilirubinemia. She was discharged with plans for monthly red cell exchange, iron chelation therapy, and close monitoring of liver disease\u202fwas\u202fplanned\u202fupon discharge.\u202fThis case illustrates that chronic liver disease can occur in sickle cell disease (Hgb SS) especially in the setting of acquired\u202firon overload. More acutely,\u202fsequestration is a serious and\u202flife-threatening\u202fcomplication of sickle cell disease\u202fthat can culminate in acute liver\u00a0failure. Primary treatment for hepatic sequestration is red cell exchange along with management of contributing comorbidities, and symptomatic management of encephalopathy. In end-stage liver disease, transplantation may be considered in the context of the\u202fpatient's clinical status.",

        "Title": "Subcellular localization of neuronal nuclei (NeuN) antigen in size and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) populations of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons during acute peripheral inflammation.",
        "Abstract": "Pseudo-unipolar cell bodies of somatosensory primary neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The somatic and peripheral domains of DRG neurons are often studied in sensory pain research to understand molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of pain and maintenance of inflammation. Adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) is an inflammatory model that elicits a robust and rapid onset immune response with a maximal swelling period of 24-48 h and persisting for several weeks. The AIA model in the hind paw of the rat elicits a potent inflammatory response of the dermis and epidermis, leading to protein expression changes for sensitization of many DRG neurons; however, it is unknown if the AIA model in the hind paw of the rat induces DRG neuronal injury, necrosis, or apoptosis at the somatic level. Neuronal nuclei (NeuN) antigen is a biomarker for post-mitotic neurons, neuronal identification, protein alterations, injury, and loss. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is expressed in C and A\u03b4 DRG neurons, a subset of DRG neurons known to play a role in peripheral sensitization. The focus of this research was to evaluate the expression pattern of NeuN immunoreactivity, in size (soma) and CGRP subpopulations of DRG neurons in na\u00efve and inflamed groups. Confirmed by both immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, DRG neuronal expression of NeuN was localized to nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular compartments. NeuN increased within the nucleus of small CGRP positive DRG neurons during inflammation, indicating a potential role for NeuN in a subset of nociceptive neurons.",

        "Title": "Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia as Presenting Symptom of Hodgkin Lymphoma.",
        "Abstract": "Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is related to an underlying condition in an estimated 50 to 60%, while the remaining is idiopathic, as a result of a combination of immune activation, deficiency, or dysregulation. AIHA is associated with viral infections, autoimmune disorders, immunodeficiencies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and pregnancy. AIHA has predictive properties and may be a harbinger of future lymphoproliferative disorders in up to 20% of AIHA cases. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) has been associated with lymphoproliferative disorders particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Rarely is it seen in Hodgkin disease. In the following report, we describe the presentation of AIHA, ultimately resulting in the diagnosis of nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma (stage III). From the limited reports and reviews available, it is understood that advanced Hodgkin (stage III or IV) of nodular sclerosis (NS) or mixed cellularity (MC) types portend a stronger affiliation to AIHA. The majority of AIHA-associated Hodgkin lymphoma presents as stage III or IV disease with the hemolysis being the presenting symptom, as in this case. The mainstay of AIHA therapy has been corticosteroids; however, this first-line regimen appears to be less effective when treating AIHA in the setting of HL. The exact mechanism of AIHA related to HL is unclear, and it may be thought to be that tumor cell produced autoantibodies. Other hypotheses include paraneoplastic phenomena or more, perhaps immunity to tumor cells may cross-react with antigens on the red cells. Although these mechanisms require further investigation, the relationship of the AIHA and HL represents a piece to a larger puzzle between autoimmune disorders and lymphoproliferative conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a valuable tool in clinical and biological research for evaluating proteins and other antigens in spatially bound tissue. In neuroinflammatory pain research, primary afferent neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) are studied to understand molecular signaling mechanisms involved in nociception (pain) and inflammation. Measuring IHC (immunofluorescence) in DRG neurons requires manual hand tracing of nuclear and somatic boundaries, which is laborious, error-prone, and may require several weeks to collect the appropriate sample size with a mouse or pen-input display monitor. To overcome these limitations and increase standardization of sampling and measurement, we employed a reliable neuronal cytoplasmic reporter, exclusive to DRG neuronal soma, in a semi-automated algorithm-based approach of Image Cytometry in rat DRG (IC-DRG). The resulting output images are binary nuclear and somatic masks of DRG neurons, defining boundaries of measurement for CellProfiler and manually scored at 94% accurate. Herein, we successfully show a novel approach of automated image analysis for DRG neurons using a robust ImageJ/FIJI script, overcoming morphological variability and imaging artifacts native to imaging frozen tissue sections processed with immunofluorescence.",

        "Abstract": "Oyster habitat restoration seeks to recover lost ecosystem services including increased provisioning of refuge and foraging habitat for fish and invertebrate communities. The goal of this study was to quantify the ecosystem service benefit of habitat provisioning in Ninigret Pond, RI following oyster restoration. We measured four metrics, abundance, biomass, species richness and diversity, as well as isotopic composition in fish and invertebrates collected seasonally from restored oyster, aquaculture, and bare sediment sites, to examine whether the oyster habitat outperformed the bare sediment habitat. Sampling locations were chosen in Foster's Cove north and south, Grassy Point, South Sanctuary, and an Aquaculture lease; each had two restored oyster sites and one bare sediment site. Each site was sampled using a box trap, seine net, shrimp trap, and minnow trap. Oyster habitats had significantly greater metrics than did bare sediment habitats in some comparisons from the box trap and seine net samples. Restored oyster sites at South Sanctuary had lower metric values than the other oyster sites. Metrics from the Aquaculture sites were comparable to the Foster's Cove and Grassy Point restored oyster sites and often outperformed South Sanctuary restored oyster sites. Seasonally, spring and autumn samples tended to have higher abundance and biomass values than summer. Isotopic composition of five species occurring at both restored oyster and bare sediment sites demonstrated some differences in the trophic levels between species but not between habitat types. In Ninigret Pond, fish and invertebrate abundance, biomass, species richness, and diversity benefit from the use of oyster and bare sediment habitats. Coastal zone managers interested in restoring the ecological function of oyster reefs to support fish and invertebrate communities should consider strategically locating restoration projects within the mosaic of structured habitats and monitoring them for selected ecosystem services.",

        "Abstract": "Context guides perception by influencing stimulus saliency. Accordingly, in visual cortex, responses to a stimulus are modulated by context, the visual scene surrounding the stimulus. Responses are suppressed when stimulus and surround are similar but not when they differ. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we use optical recordings, manipulations, and computational modeling to show that disinhibitory circuits consisting of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing and somatostatin (SOM)-expressing inhibitory neurons modulate responses in mouse visual cortex depending on similarity between stimulus and surround, primarily by modulating recurrent excitation. When stimulus and surround are similar, VIP neurons are inactive, and activity of SOM neurons leads to suppression of excitatory neurons. However, when stimulus and surround differ, VIP neurons are active, inhibiting SOM neurons, which leads to relief of excitatory neurons from suppression. We have identified a canonical cortical disinhibitory circuit that contributes to contextual modulation and may regulate perceptual saliency.",

        "Title": "Experimental study of the proton-transfer reaction C + H",
        "Abstract": "We report absolute integral cross section (ICS) measurements using a dual-source merged-fast-beams apparatus to study the titular reactions over the relative translational energy range of Er \u223c 0.01-10 eV. We used photodetachment of C- to produce a pure beam of atomic C in the ground electronic 3P term, with statistically populated fine-structure levels. The H2+ and D2+ were formed in an electron impact ionization source, with well known vibrational and rotational distributions. The experimental work is complemented by a theoretical study of the CH2+ electronic system in the reactant and product channels, which helps to clarify the possible reaction mechanisms underlying the ICS measurements. Our measurements provide evidence that the reactions are barrierless and exoergic. They also indicate the apparent absence of an intermolecular isotope effect, to within the total experimental uncertainties. Capture models, taking into account either the charge-induced dipole interaction potential or the combined charge-quadrupole and charge-induced dipole interaction potentials, produce reaction cross sections that lie a factor of \u223c4 above the experimental results. Based on our theoretical study, we hypothesize that the reaction is most likely to proceed adiabatically through the 14A' and 14A'' states of CH2+via the reaction C(3P) + H2+(2\u03a3+g) \u2192 CH+(3\u03a0) + H(2S). We also hypothesize that at low collision energies only H2+(v \u2264 2) and D2+(v \u2264 3) contribute to the titular reactions, due to the onset of dissociative charge transfer for higher vibrational v levels. Incorporating these assumptions into the capture models brings them into better agreement with the experimental results. Still, for energies \u2a850.1 eV where capture models are most relevant, the modified charge-induced dipole model yields reaction cross sections with an incorrect energy dependence and lying \u223c10% below the experimental results. The capture cross section obtained from the combined charge-quadrupole and charge-induced dipole model better matches the measured energy dependence but lies \u223c30-50% above the experimental results. These findings provide important guidance for future quasiclassical trajectory and quantum mechanical treatments of this reaction.",

        "Abstract": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by an acute, diffuse, inflammatory lung injury, leading to increased alveolar capillary permeability, increased lung weight, and loss of aerated lung tissue (Fan, Brodie, & Slutsky, 2018). Primary treatment for ARDS is artificial mechanical ventilation (AMV) (Wu, Huang, Wu, Wang, & Lin, 2016). Given recent advances in technology, the use of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) to treat severe ARDS is growing rapidly (Combes et al., 2014).",

Parenting interventions generally prioritize the acquisition of parenting knowledge and skills, while under-attending to parental stress and distress. This paper describes the development of the Caregiver Support Intervention (CSI), a nine-session group intervention for conflict-affected parents of children aged 3-13, that aims to strengthen parenting both indirectly, by lowering stress and improving psychosocial wellbeing among parents, and directly, by increasing knowledge and skill related to positive parenting.",

        "Abstract": "Patients who develop one primary neoplasm are at increased risk for second cancers. Chemotherapeutic agents can result in DNA damage leading to clonal hematopoiesis, thereby causing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Alkylating agents and topoisomerase inhibitors are most frequently implicated in therapy-related MDS. We report four patients with gastropancreatic malignancies (two with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and two with gastric adenocarcinoma) who developed MDS during or after the treatment of their primary gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. Two of these patients were diagnosed with MDS during maintenance therapy with ramucirumab. To our knowledge, development of MDS in association with ramucirumab has not been previously reported in the literature. Our findings also suggest that with continued improvement in survival of patients with GI and pancreatic malignancies, more cases of treatment-related MDS might be identified.",

        "Abstract": "This study was to examine the effect of leaning-forward posture (LFP) on gait parameters while using a rolling walker (RW). A cross-sectional study was conducted in which 23 older female adults were asked to walk with a RW on the GaitRite walkway in two posture situations: upright posture, and LFP caused by pushing the RW forward and then following the RW. The temporal and spatial gait parameters were obtained for data analysis. Results showed that compared with the upright posture, participants with LFP demonstrated significantly increased cadence, decreased velocity and gait cycle time (both swing and stance time decreased). Of spatial parameters, both step and stride length significantly decreased, but the base of support increased significantly. These indicate that LFP during ambulation with a RW could lead participants to a shuffling-like (many steps on short distance) gait pattern. They may help clinicians find proper rehabilitation interventions and appropriate patient education for this specific postural presentation.",

        "Abstract": "Since my first exposure to the acronym 'QbD' more than ten years ago, I have been trying to understand exactly what QbD is and how I might incorporate its teachings into my twenty-odd years of experience developing transdermal systems. I feel I have made little progress since then. Eventually, I came to realize that while QbD has its merits, it is not a guide for (transdermal) product development, despite so often being described as such. Instead, I have come to consider QbD as a language useful for organizing and presenting the array of data supporting the approval of a new product, but it still leaves the experimental approach entirely up to the developer. What QbD does provide to the development community is a means of conveying product information through a consistent framework facilitating both internal and regulatory review. As a result, new 'QbD' product applications tend to be more uniform and complete than the applications that preceded the initiative.",

Persistent parental stress and distress may lead to unresponsive, anxious, or overly harsh parenting and a corresponding increase in emotional and behavior problems among children. Most parenting interventions emphasize the acquisition of knowledge and skills; however, this overlooks the deleterious effects of chronic stress on parenting.

The CSI is a nine-session psychosocial group intervention delivered by non-specialist providers. It is intended for all adult primary caregivers of children in high-adversity communities, rather than specifically targeting caregivers already showing signs of elevated distress.",

        "Abstract": "When two therapeutic agents are combined in a single formulation, i.e., coformulated, the quality and safety of the individual agents must be preserved. Here we describe an approach to evaluate the quality attributes of two individual monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), designated mAb-A and mAb-B, in coformulation. The mAbs were fractionated from heat-stressed coformulated drug product (DP) by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Each purified mAb fraction was then compared with mAb-A and mAb-B in their individual formulations from the same drug substance sources used to make the coformulated DP lot, which was subjected to the same stress conditions. Product variants were evaluated and compared by using several analytical tests, including high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), reducing and nonreducing gel electrophoresis, ion-exchange chromatography, capillary isoelectric focusing, and peptide mapping with mass spectrometry. Intermolecular interactions in coformulated and photostressed DPs were studied by evaluating aggregates fractionated from coformulated DP by HPSEC. Aggregate fractions of coformulated DP contained dimers, but not coaggregates, of mAb-A or mAb-B. Moreover, extensive assays for higher-order structure and biological interactions confirmed that there was no interaction between the two mAb molecules in the coformulation. These results demonstrate that the two coformulated therapeutic mAbs had the same quality attributes as the individually formulated mAb-A and mAb-B, no new quality attributes were formed, and no physicochemical, intermolecular, or biological interactions occurred between the two components. The approach described here can be used to monitor the product quality of other coformulated antibodies.",

        "Abstract": "Systems neuroscience seeks explanations for how the brain implements a wide variety of perceptual, cognitive and motor tasks. Conversely, artificial intelligence attempts to design computational systems based on the tasks they will have to solve. In artificial neural networks, the three components specified by design are the objective functions, the learning rules and the architectures. With the growing success of deep learning, which utilizes brain-inspired architectures, these three designed components have increasingly become central to how we model, engineer and optimize complex artificial learning systems. Here we argue that a greater focus on these components would also benefit systems neuroscience. We give examples of how this optimization-based framework can drive theoretical and experimental progress in neuroscience. We contend that this principled perspective on systems neuroscience will help to generate more rapid progress.",

        "Abstract": "Given that pain relief is often the primary goal of orthopaedic surgery, an accurate assessment of pain is paramount. The objectives of this cross-sectional analytical study were to (1) compare how the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pain interference (PI) computer adaptive test (CT) performs against the Numeric Pain Scale (NPS) measure in evaluating pain, and (2) to determine demographic, clinical, and psychosocial correlates of PI in an urban population undergoing a variety of knee surgeries. We hypothesized that there would be a strong correlation between PI and NPS, with minimal floor and ceiling effects; and that a worse PI score would be associated with a worse general health profile. The sample consisted of 412 patients undergoing knee surgery at an urban academic center. Patients were preoperatively administered measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Bivariate and multivariable statistical analyses were performed to identify significant independent predictors. The mean PI score was 60.3\u2009\u00b1\u20097.2 and had no floor or ceiling effects, whereas NPS demonstrated a greater percentage of patients scoring at the extremes of the measure. Worse PI scores were associated with older age, higher body mass index (BMI), greater comorbidity, lower income, smoking, female gender, Hispanic ethnicity, Black race, unemployment, opioid use, lower expectations, and greater American Society of Anesthesiologists score (",

        "Abstract": "Using exome sequencing, we have identified de novo variants in MAPK8IP3 in 13 unrelated individuals presenting with an overlapping phenotype of mild to severe intellectual disability. The de novo variants comprise six missense variants, three of which are recurrent, and three truncating variants. Brain anomalies such as perisylvian polymicrogyria, cerebral or cerebellar atrophy, and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum were consistent among individuals harboring recurrent de novo missense variants. MAPK8IP3 has been shown to be involved in the retrograde axonal-transport machinery, but many of its specific functions are yet to be elucidated. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to target six conserved amino acid positions in Caenorhabditis elegans, we found that two of the six investigated human alterations led to a significantly elevated density of axonal lysosomes, and five variants were associated with adverse locomotion. Reverse-engineering normalized the observed adverse effects back to wild-type levels. Combining genetic, phenotypic, and functional findings, as well as the significant enrichment of de novo variants in MAPK8IP3 within our total cohort of 27,232 individuals who underwent exome sequencing, we implicate de novo variants in MAPK8IP3 as a cause of a neurodevelopmental disorder with intellectual disability and variable brain anomalies.",

        "Abstract": "Synaptic vesicles (SVs) transmit signals by releasing neurotransmitters from specialized synaptic regions of neurons. In the synaptic region, SVs are tightly clustered around small structures called active zones. The motor KIF1A transports SVs outward through axons until they are captured in the synaptic region. This transport must be guided in the forward direction because it is opposed by the dynein motor, which causes SVs to reverse direction multiple times en route. The core synapse stability (CSS) system contributes to both guided transport and capture of SVs. We identified Sentryn as a CSS protein that contributes to the synaptic localization of SVs in ",

        "Abstract": "Dense core vesicles (DCVs) can transmit signals by releasing neuropeptides from specialized synaptic regions called active zones. DCVs reach the active zone by motorized transport through a long axon. A reverse motor frequently interrupts progress by taking DCVs in the opposite direction. \"Guided transport\" refers to the mechanism by which outward movements ultimately dominate to bring DCVs to the synaptic region. After guided transport, DCVs alter their interactions with motors and enter a \"captured\" state. The mechanisms of guided transport and capture of DCVs are unknown. Here, we discovered two proteins that contribute to both processes in ",

        "Abstract": "Incorporation of fish age into the assessment of status and trends for persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals in the Great Lakes has become an important step for the U.S. EPA's Great Lakes Fish Monitoring and Surveillance Program (GLFMSP). A slowing in the rate of decline for total PCBs in Lake Huron beginning in 2000, led the Program to complete a retrospective analysis to assess how chemical contamination may be influenced by fish age. Analytical results suggest that fish age is an important variable when assessing contaminant trends and that the Program needed to revise its compositing scheme to group fish according to age, rather than by length, prior to homogenization and chemical analysis. An Interlaboratory comparison study of multiple age structures was performed to identify the most appropriate age estimation structure for the Program. The lake trout (",

        "Abstract": "How does attentional modulation of neural activity enhance performance? Here we use a deep convolutional neural network as a large-scale model of the visual system to address this question. We model the feature similarity gain model of attention, in which attentional modulation is applied according to neural stimulus tuning. Using a variety of visual tasks, we show that neural modulations of the kind and magnitude observed experimentally lead to performance changes of the kind and magnitude observed experimentally. We find that, at earlier layers, attention applied according to tuning does not successfully propagate through the network, and has a weaker impact on performance than attention applied according to values computed for optimally modulating higher areas. This raises the question of whether biological attention might be applied at least in part to optimize function rather than strictly according to tuning. We suggest a simple experiment to distinguish these alternatives.",

There is limited literature on the biological behavior and clinical features of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of head and neck post-HSCT. We present the clinical and pathologic characteristics on six patients who were diagnosed with SCC while in remission following an allogeneic HSCT. Median follow-up was 8 years. Five patients (83%) developed SCC of tongue and one developed esophageal SCC. Five patients had oral chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD). The conventional risk factors of alcohol, tobacco, and human papillomavirus were absent. The most common presenting finding was the new-onset focal oral pain and ulcerated plaques clinically indistinguishable from a flare of their oral cGvHD lesions. We demonstrated that the SCC in three patients was of donor origin.",

A screening magnetic resonance image of the patient's head demonstrated a new bilateral pituitary mass. Initial evaluation revealed low morning cortisol, and the patient was diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency. His symptoms rapidly improved with maintenance glucocorticoids. Soon thereafter, the patient developed an acute visual deficit secondary to enlargement of the pituitary mass, and biopsy revealed EGFR T790M positive metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Hence, we present a rare case of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma to the pituitary causing secondary adrenal insufficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Correlated variability in cortical activity is ubiquitously quenched following stimulus onset, in a stimulus-dependent manner. These modulations have been attributed to circuit dynamics involving either multiple stable states (\"attractors\") or chaotic activity. Here we show that a qualitatively different dynamical regime, involving fluctuations about a single, stimulus-driven attractor in a loosely balanced excitatory-inhibitory network (the stochastic \"stabilized supralinear network\"), best explains these modulations. Given the supralinear input/output functions of cortical neurons, increased stimulus drive strengthens effective network connectivity. This shifts the balance from interactions that amplify\u00a0variability to suppressive inhibitory feedback, quenching correlated variability around more strongly driven steady states. Comparing to previously published and original data analyses, we show that this mechanism, unlike previous proposals, uniquely accounts for the spatial patterns and fast temporal dynamics of variability suppression. Specifying the cortical operating regime is key\u00a0to understanding the computations underlying perception.",

        "Abstract": "For biotherapeutics and vaccines, potency is measured in a bioassay that compares the concentration-response curves of a new batch to that of a reference standard. Acceptable accuracy and precision of potency measurement is critical to the manufacturing of these products. These characteristics of a bioassay are typically assessed in a procedure that is carried out with samples spanning the acceptable range for the product. During early development, however, a full validation study such as that which is carried out in late development can be costly as it relates to the likelihood of eventual program success. For these reasons, the laboratory may look for alternative ways to ensure the validity of the bioassay across a range that will support product development. One such alternative combines information from a reduced procedure using only reference standard and 100% relative potency concentration-response data sets, together with computer simulation, to estimate missing relative potency values across the desired range. Fits to the reduced dataset provide estimates of bioassay model parameters such as those for an S-shaped potency assay that follows a four-parameter logistic relationship, along with estimates of their variance-covariance structure and independent experimental unit (e.g., well-to-well or animal-to-animal) errors. Using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo modeling, the predictive distribution of the concentration-response data for the desired levels of relative potency is generated. Results from use of the reduced procedure are compared to results calculated from a full dataset in Monte Carlo simulation and in a motivating example.",

        "Abstract": "Over the past decade, nitrogen (N) loads to Narragansett Bay have decreased by more than 50%. These reductions were, in large part, the direct result of multiple wastewater treatment facility upgrades to tertiary treatment, a process which employs N removal. Here we document ecosystem response to the N reductions and assess how the distribution of sewage N in Narragansett Bay has changed from before, during, and shortly after the upgrades. While others have observed clear responses when data were considered annually, our seasonal and regional comparisons of pre- and post-tertiary treatment dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations and Secchi depth data, from bay-wide surveys conducted periodically from the early 1970s through 2016, resulted in only a few subtle differences. Thus we sought to use stable isotope data to assess how sewage N is incorporated into the ecology of the Bay and how its distribution may have changed after the upgrades. The nitrogen (\u03b4",

        "Abstract": "In the visual system, the response to a stimulus in a neuron's receptive field can be modulated by stimulus context, and the strength of these contextual influences vary with stimulus intensity. Recent work has shown how a theoretical model, the stabilized supralinear network (SSN), can account for such modulatory influences, using a small set of computational mechanisms. Although the predictions of the SSN have been confirmed in primary visual cortex (V1), its computational principles apply with equal validity to any cortical structure. We have therefore tested the generality of the SSN by examining modulatory influences in the middle temporal area (MT) of the macaque visual cortex, using electrophysiological recordings and pharmacological manipulations. We developed a novel stimulus that can be adjusted parametrically to be larger or smaller in the space of all possible motion directions. We found, as predicted by the SSN, that MT neurons integrate across motion directions for low-contrast stimuli, but that they exhibit suppression by the same stimuli when they are high in contrast. These results are analogous to those found in visual cortex when stimulus size is varied in the space domain. We further tested the mechanisms of inhibition using pharmacological manipulations of inhibitory efficacy. As predicted by the SSN, local manipulation of inhibitory strength altered firing rates, but did not change the strength of surround suppression. These results are consistent with the idea that the SSN can account for modulatory influences along different stimulus dimensions and in different cortical areas.",

        "Abstract": "The crisis in Syria has resulted in vast numbers of refugees seeking asylum in Syria's neighbouring countries as well as in Europe. Refugees are at considerable risk of developing common mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Most refugees do not have access to mental health services for these problems because of multiple barriers in national and refugee specific health systems, including limited availability of mental health professionals. To counter some of challenges arising from limited mental health system capacity the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a range of scalable psychological interventions aimed at reducing psychological distress and improving functioning in people living in communities affected by adversity. These interventions, including Problem Management Plus (PM+) and its variants, are intended to be delivered through individual or group face-to-face or smartphone formats by lay, non-professional people who have not received specialized mental health training, We provide an evidence-based rationale for the use of the scalable PM+ oriented programmes being adapted for Syrian refugees and provide information on the newly launched STRENGTHS programme for adapting, testing and scaling up of PM+ in various modalities in both neighbouring and European countries hosting Syrian refugees.",

        "Abstract": "Cells operate through protein interaction networks organized in space and time. Here, we describe an approach to resolve both dimensions simultaneously by using proximity labeling mediated by engineered ascorbic acid peroxidase (APEX). APEX has been used to capture entire organelle proteomes with high temporal resolution, but its breadth of labeling is generally thought to preclude the higher spatial resolution necessary to interrogate specific protein networks. We provide a solution to this problem by combining quantitative proteomics with a system of spatial references. As proof of principle, we apply this approach to interrogate proteins engaged by G-protein-coupled receptors as they dynamically signal and traffic in response to ligand-induced activation. The method resolves known binding partners, as well as previously unidentified network components. Validating its utility as a discovery pipeline, we establish that two of these proteins promote ubiquitin-linked receptor downregulation after prolonged activation.",

        "Abstract": "Little is known about the internal circuitry of the primate lateral intraparietal area (LIP). During two versions of a delayed-saccade task, we found radically different network dynamics beneath similar population average firing patterns. When neurons are not influenced by stimuli outside their receptive fields (RFs), dynamics of the high-dimensional LIP network during slowly varying activity lie predominantly in one multi-neuronal dimension, as described previously. However, when activity is suppressed by stimuli outside the RF, slow LIP dynamics markedly deviate from a single dimension. The conflicting results can be reconciled if two LIP local networks, each underlying an RF location and dominated by a single multi-neuronal activity pattern, are suppressively coupled to each other. These results demonstrate the low dimensionality of slow LIP local dynamics, and suggest that LIP local networks encoding the attentional and movement priority of competing visual locations actively suppress one another.",

Using the SEER-Medicare database from 2000 to 2007, we examined the costs and life-year benefit of Auto-HSCT for MM patients over the age of 65 by evaluating the difference over time relative to comorbidity burden. One hundred ten patients had an Auto-HSCT in the early time period (2000-2003) and 160 in the late time period (2004-2007). Patients were divided by a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of 0 or greater than 1 (CCI1+). Median overall survival was 53.5 months for the late time period patients compared to 40.3 months for the early time period patients (",

        "Abstract": "Recombinant therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) must be purified from host cell proteins (HCPs), DNA, and other impurities present in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture media. HCPs can potentially result in adverse clinical responses in patients and, in specific cases, have caused degradation of the final mAb product. As reported previously, residual traces of cathepsin D caused particle formation in the final product of mAb-1. The current work was focused on identification of a primary sequence in mAb-1 responsible for the binding and consequent co-purification of trace levels of CHO cathepsin D. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to detect binding between immobilized CHO cathepsin D and a panel of mAbs. Out of 13 mAbs tested, only mAb-1 and mAb-6 bound to cathepsin D. An LYY motif in the HC CDR2 was common, yet unique, to only these two mAbs. Mutation of LYY to AAA eliminated binding of mAb-1 to cathepsin D providing confirmation that this sequence motif was involved in the binding to CHO cathepsin D. Interestingly, the binding between mAb-1 and cathepsin D was weaker than that of mAb-6, which may be related to the fact that two aspartic acid residues near the LYY motif in mAb-1 are replaced with neutral serine residues in mAb-6. \u00a9 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

        "Abstract": "Molecularly targeted anti-cancer therapies have revolutionized cancer treatment by improving both quality of life and survival in cancer patients. However, many of these drugs are associated with cardiovascular toxicities that are sometimes dose-limiting. Moreover, the long-term cardiovascular consequences of these drugs, some of which are used chronically, are not yet known. Although the scope and mechanisms of the cardiac toxicities are better defined, the mechanisms for vascular toxicities are only beginning to be elucidated. This review summarizes what is known about the vascular adverse events associated with three classes of novel anti-cancer therapies: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, breakpoint cluster-Abelson (BCR-ABL) kinase inhibitors used to treat chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) used in myeloma therapeutics. Three of the best described vascular toxicities are reviewed including hypertension, increased risk of acute cardiovascular ischaemic events and arteriovenous thrombosis. The available data regarding the mechanism by which each therapy causes vascular complication are summarized. When data are limited, potential mechanisms are inferred from the known effects of inhibiting each target on vascular cell function and disease. Enhanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms of vascular side effects of targeted cancer therapy is necessary to effectively manage cancer patients and to design safer targeted cancer therapies for the future.",

        "Abstract": "Common and roseate terns are migratory piscivorous seabirds with major breeding colonies within feeding range of the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated New Bedford Harbor (NBH, MA, USA) Superfund site. Our longitudinal study shows that before PCB discharges into NBH ceased (late 1970s), tern eggs had very high but variable PCB concentrations. However, egg concentrations of PCBs as well as DDE (1,1-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene), the degradation product of the ubiquitous global contaminant DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane), have since declined. Rate constants for temporal decline of PCB congeners in tern eggs varied inversely with log10KOW (n-octanol-water partition coefficient), shifting egg congener patterns away from those characterizing NBH sediment. To estimate the toxic effects on tern eggs of PCB dioxin-like congener (DLC) exposures, we extrapolated published laboratory data on common terns to roseate terns by characterizing genetic and functional similarities in species aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AHRs), which mediate DLC sensitivity. Our assessment of contaminant risks suggests that terns breeding near NBH were exposed historically to toxic levels of PCBs and DDE; however, acute effects on tern egg development have become less likely since the 1970s. Our approach demonstrates how comparative genetics at target loci can effectively increase the range of inference for chemical risk assessments from tested to untested and untestable species.",

        "Title": "Characterization of glutamatergic neurons in the rat atrial intrinsic cardiac ganglia that project to the cardiac ventricular wall.",
        "Abstract": "The intrinsic cardiac nervous system modulates cardiac function by acting as an integration site for regulating autonomic efferent cardiac output. This intrinsic system is proposed to be composed of a short cardio-cardiac feedback control loop within the cardiac innervation hierarchy. For example, electrophysiological studies have postulated the presence of sensory neurons in intrinsic cardiac ganglia (ICG) for regional cardiac control. There is still a knowledge gap, however, about the anatomical location and neurochemical phenotype of sensory neurons inside ICG. In the present study, rat ICG neurons were characterized neurochemically with immunohistochemistry using glutamatergic markers: vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (VGLUT1; VGLUT2), and glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme essential for glutamate production. Glutamatergic neurons (VGLUT1/VGLUT2/GLS) in the ICG that have axons to the ventricles were identified by retrograde tracing of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) injected in the ventricular wall. Co-labeling of VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and GLS with the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) was used to evaluate the relationship between post-ganglionic autonomic neurons and glutamatergic neurons. Sequential labeling of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in adjacent tissue sections was used to evaluate the co-localization of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in ICG neurons. Our studies yielded the following results: (1) ICG contain glutamatergic neurons with GLS for glutamate production and VGLUT1 and 2 for transport of glutamate into synaptic vesicles; (2) atrial ICG contain neurons that project to ventricle walls and these neurons are glutamatergic; (3) many glutamatergic ICG neurons also were cholinergic, expressing VAChT; (4) VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 co-localization occurred in ICG neurons with variation of their protein expression level. Investigation of both glutamatergic and cholinergic ICG neurons could help in better understanding the function of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system.",

        "Abstract": "In neurons, a single motor (dynein) transports large organelles as well as synaptic and dense core vesicles toward microtubule minus ends; however, it is unclear why dynein appears more active on organelles, which are generally excluded from mature axons, than on synaptic and dense core vesicles, which are maintained at high levels. Recent studies in Zebrafish and Caenorhabditis elegans have shown that JIP3 promotes dynein-mediated retrograde transport to clear some organelles (lysosomes, early endosomes, and Golgi) from axons and prevent their potentially harmful accumulation in presynaptic regions. A JIP3 mutant suppressor screen in C. elegans revealed that JIP3 promotes the clearance of organelles from axons by blocking the action of the CSS system (Cdk5, SAD Kinase, SYD-2/Liprin). A synthesis of results in vertebrates with the new findings suggests that JIP3 blocks the CSS system from disrupting the connection between dynein and organelles. Most components of the CSS system are enriched at presynaptic active zones where they normally contribute to maintaining optimal levels of captured synaptic and dense core vesicles, in part by inhibiting dynein transport. The JIP3-CSS system model explains how neurons selectively regulate a single minus-end motor to exclude specific classes of organelles from axons, while at the same time ensuring optimal levels of synaptic and dense core vesicles.",

        "Abstract": "Research on the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of children in conflict-affected settings has undergone a significant paradigm shift in recent years. Earlier studies based on a war exposure model primarily emphasized the effects of direct exposure to armed conflict; this has gradually given way to a broader understanding of the diverse pathways by which organized violence affects children. A robustly supported comprehensive model includes risk factors at multiple points in time (prior war exposure, ongoing daily stressors) and at all levels of the social ecology. In particular, findings suggest that material deprivation and a set of family variables, including harsh parenting, parental distress, and witnessing intimate partner violence, are important mediators of the relationship between armed conflict and children's wellbeing. To date, however, interventions aimed at supporting war-affected children's wellbeing, both preventive and treatment-focused, have focused primarily on direct work with children, while paying only modest attention to ongoing risk factors in their families and broader environments. Possible reasons for the ongoing prioritization of child-focused interventions are considered, and examples are provided of recent evidence-based interventions that have reduced toxic stressors (harsh parenting and the use of violent discipline by teachers) in conflict-affected communities.",

        "Abstract": "Pluripotent stem cells exhibit cell cycle-regulated heterogeneity for trimethylation of histone-3 on lysine-4 (H3K4me3) on developmental gene promoters containing bivalent epigenetic domains. The heterogeneity of H3K4me3 can be attributed to Cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) phosphorylation and activation of the histone methyltransferase, MLL2 (KMT2B), during late-G1. The deposition of H3K4me3 on developmental promoters in late-G1 establishes a permissive chromatin architecture that enables signaling cues to promote differentiation from the G1 phase. These data suggest that the inhibition of MLL2 phosphorylation and activation will prevent the initiation of differentiation. Here, we describe a method to seamlessly modify a putative CDK2 phosphorylation site on MLL2 to restrict its phosphorylation and activation. Specifically, by utilizing dimeric CRISPR RNA-guided nucleases, RFNs (commercially known as the NextGEN\u2122 CRISPR), in combination with an excision-only piggyBac\u2122 transposase, we demonstrate how to generate a point mutation of threonine-542, a predicted site to prevent MLL2 activation. This gene editing method enables the use of both positive and negative selection, and allows for subsequent removal of the donor cassette without leaving behind any unwanted DNA sequences or modifications. This seamless \"donor-excision\" approach provides clear advantages over using single stranded oligo-deoxynucleotides (ssODN) as donors to create point mutations, as the use of ssODN necessitate additional mutations in the donor PAM sequence, along with extensive cloning efforts. The method described here therefore provides the highest targeting efficiency with the lowest \"off-target\" mutation rates possible, while removing the labor-intensive efforts associated with screening thousands of clones. In sum, this chapter describes how seamless gene editing may be utilized to examine stem cell heterogeneity of epigenetic marks, but is also widely applicable for performing precise genetic manipulations in numerous other cell types.",

        "Abstract": "The idea that there is a fundamental cortical circuit that performs canonical computations remains compelling though far from proven. Here we review evidence for two canonical operations within sensory cortical areas: a feedforward computation of selectivity; and a recurrent computation of gain in which, given sufficiently strong external input, perhaps from multiple sources, intracortical input largely, but not completely, cancels this external input. This operation leads to many characteristic cortical nonlinearities in integrating multiple stimuli. The cortical computation must combine such local processing with hierarchical processing across areas. We point to important changes in moving from sensory cortex to motor and frontal cortex and the possibility of substantial differences between cortex in rodents vs. species with columnar organization of selectivity.",

        "Abstract": "Glutamate is a neurotransmitter used at both the peripheral and central terminals of nociceptive primary sensory neurons, yet little is known concerning regulation of glutamate metabolism during peripheral inflammation. Glutaminase (GLS) is an enzyme of the glutamate-glutamine cycle that converts glutamine into glutamate for neurotransmission and is implicated in producing elevated levels of glutamate in central and peripheral terminals. A potential mechanism for increased levels of glutamate is an elevation in GLS expression. We assessed GLS expression after unilateral hind paw inflammation by measuring GLS immunoreactivity (ir) with quantitative image analysis of L4 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons after one, two, four, and eight days of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) compared to saline injected controls. No significant elevation in GLS-ir occurred in the DRG ipsilateral to the inflamed hind paw after one or two days of AIA. After four days AIA, GLS-ir was elevated significantly in all sizes of DRG neurons. After eight days AIA, GLS-ir remained elevated in small (<400 \u00b5m\u00b2), presumably nociceptive neurons. Western blot analysis of the L4 DRG at day four AIA confirmed the elevated GLS-ir. The present study indicates that GLS expression is increased in the chronic stage of inflammation and may be a target for chronic pain therapy.",

        "Title": "Evaluating the Analgesic Effect of the GLS Inhibitor 6-Diazo-5-Oxo-L-Norleucine in Vivo.",
        "Abstract": "Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter, produced by its synthetic enzyme, glutaminase (GLS), and packaged by vesicular transporters (VGluT2) into synaptic vesicles. Primary sensory peripheral nerve and spinal synaptic terminals release glutamate during nociceptive (pain) signaling. In post-incisional and inflammation models in rats, GLS and VGluT2 production is elevated in dorsal root ganglion neuronal cell bodies and transported to peripheral and spinal terminals for increased glutamate synthesis and release. 6-Diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON) is a GLS inhibitor that produces long lasting pain relief when applied to the inflamed paw of arthritic rats, but its effect in a post-incisional model has not been evaluated. In this study, we examined the analgesic efficacy of DON in a surgical incision model by measuring thermal latency and mechanical allodynia. Following behavioral evaluation, we examined the skin for VGluT2, GLS and glutamate immunoreactivity (ir). Our findings revealed that VGluT2-ir is elevated in the stratum lucidum by approximately 19%, 64 hours post-surgical incision and attenuated by approximately 5.4% after the administration of DON. During that same period GLS-ir was elevated in dermal nerve fibers by 52% and was attenuated by approximately 27.9% after the application of DON. Additionally, glutamate-ir was elevated in epidermal nerve fibers by 35% after incision and attenuated by approximately 23% after the administration of DON. Behavioral testing 24 and 48 hours after a single local administration of DON showed five out of six animals having an analgesic response to mechanical allodynia, but not to thermal hyperalgesia. Following a surgical incision, the area of injury shows increased VGluT2-, GLS-, glutamate-ir, mechanical allodynia and no change in thermal latency. After the application of the GLS inhibitor, DON, nerve fiber of the skin showed decreased VGluT2, GLS, and glutamate-ir. Furthermore, post-incision DON treated animals exhibited decreased mechanical allodynia with no change in thermal latency when compared to control animals.",

        "Abstract": "The conserved protein UNC-16 (JIP3) inhibits the active transport of some cell soma organelles, such as lysosomes, early endosomes, and Golgi, to the synaptic region of axons. However, little is known about UNC-16's organelle transport regulatory function, which is distinct from its Kinesin-1 adaptor function. We used an unc-16 suppressor screen in Caenorhabditis elegans to discover that UNC-16 acts through CDK-5 (Cdk5) and two conserved synapse assembly proteins: SAD-1 (SAD-A Kinase), and SYD-2 (Liprin-\u03b1). Genetic analysis of all combinations of double and triple mutants in unc-16(+) and unc-16(-) backgrounds showed that the three proteins (CDK-5, SAD-1, and SYD-2) are all part of the same organelle transport regulatory system, which we named the CSS system based on its founder proteins. Further genetic analysis revealed roles for SYD-1 (another synapse assembly protein) and STRAD\u03b1 (a SAD-1-interacting protein) in the CSS system. In an unc-16(-) background, loss of the CSS system improved the sluggish locomotion of unc-16 mutants, inhibited axonal lysosome accumulation, and led to the dynein-dependent accumulation of lysosomes in dendrites. Time-lapse imaging of lysosomes in CSS system mutants in unc-16(+) and unc-16(-) backgrounds revealed active transport defects consistent with the steady-state distributions of lysosomes. UNC-16 also uses the CSS system to regulate the distribution of early endosomes in neurons and, to a lesser extent, Golgi. The data reveal a new and unprecedented role for synapse assembly proteins, acting as part of the newly defined CSS system, in mediating UNC-16's organelle transport regulatory function.",

        "Title": "Synapse-Assembly Proteins Maintain Synaptic Vesicle Cluster Stability and Regulate Synaptic Vesicle Transport in Caenorhabditis elegans.",
        "Abstract": "The functional integrity of neurons requires the bidirectional active transport of synaptic vesicles (SVs) in axons. The kinesin motor KIF1A transports SVs from somas to stable SV clusters at synapses, while dynein moves them in the opposite direction. However, it is unclear how SV transport is regulated and how SVs at clusters interact with motor proteins. We addressed these questions by isolating a rare temperature-sensitive allele of Caenorhabditis elegans unc-104 (KIF1A) that allowed us to manipulate SV levels in axons and dendrites. Growth at 20\u00b0 and 14\u00b0 resulted in locomotion rates that were \u223c3 and 50% of wild type, respectively, with similar effects on axonal SV levels. Corresponding with the loss of SVs from axons, mutants grown at 14\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 showed a 10- and 24-fold dynein-dependent accumulation of SVs in their dendrites. Mutants grown at 14\u00b0 and switched to 25\u00b0 showed an abrupt irreversible 50% decrease in locomotion and a 50% loss of SVs from the synaptic region 12-hr post-shift, with no further decreases at later time points, suggesting that the remaining clustered SVs are stable and resistant to retrograde removal by dynein. The data further showed that the synapse-assembly proteins SYD-1, SYD-2, and SAD-1 protected SV clusters from degradation by motor proteins. In syd-1, syd-2, and sad-1 mutants, SVs accumulate in an UNC-104-dependent manner in the distal axon region that normally lacks SVs. In addition to their roles in SV cluster stability, all three proteins also regulate SV transport.",

        "Abstract": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Water Laboratory Alliance (WLA) currently uses ultrafiltration (UF) for concentration of biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) agents from large volumes (up to 100-L) of drinking water prior to analysis. Most UF procedures require comprehensive training and practice to achieve and maintain proficiency. As a result, there was a critical need to develop quality control (QC) criteria. Because select agents are difficult to work with and pose a significant safety hazard, QC criteria were developed using surrogates, including Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus atrophaeus. This article presents the results from the QC criteria development study and results from a subsequent demonstration exercise in which E. faecalis was used to evaluate proficiency using UF to concentrate large volume drinking water samples. Based on preliminary testing EPA Method 1600 and Standard Methods 9218, for E. faecalis and B. atrophaeus respectively, were selected for use during the QC criteria development study. The QC criteria established for Method 1600 were used to assess laboratory performance during the demonstration exercise. Based on the results of the QC criteria study E. faecalis and B. atrophaeus can be used effectively to demonstrate and maintain proficiency using ultrafiltration.",

        "Abstract": "In the past decade, the number of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplants (Auto HSCT) for older patients with multiple myeloma (MM) has increased dramatically, as has the cost of transplantation. The cost-effectiveness of this modality in patients over age 65 is unclear. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database to create a propensity-score matched sample of patients over age 65 between 2000 and 2007, we compared the survival and cost for those who received Auto HSCT to those who did not undergo transplantation but survived at least 6 months after diagnosis, and we calculated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Two hundred seventy patients underwent transplantation. Median overall survival from diagnosis in those who underwent transplantation was significantly longer than in patients who did not (58 months versus 37 months, P < .001). For patients living longer than 2 years, the median monthly cost during the first year was significantly different, but the middle and last year of life costs were similar. The median cost of the first 100 days after transplantation was $60,000 (range, $37,000 to $85,000). The resultant ICER was $72,852 per life-year gained. Survival after transplantation was comparable to that in those who underwent transplantation patients under 65 years and significantly longer than older patients who did not undergo transplantation. With an ICER less than $100,000/life-year gained, Auto HSCT is cost-effective when compared with nontransplantation care in the era of novel agents and should be considered, where clinically indicated, for patients over the age of 65.",

        "Title": "A Feminine Care Clinical Research Program Transforms Women's Lives.",
        "Abstract": "Feminine hygiene products and menstruation education have transformed the lives of women throughout the world. The P&G Feminine Care Clinical Innovation Research Program has played a key role by expanding scientific knowledge as well as developing technical insights and tools for the development of feminine hygiene products. The aim has been to meet the needs of women throughout their life stages, advancing their urogenital health beyond just menstruation, as well as helping to understand the role of sex hormones in various important health issues that women face. This review article highlights key contributions and research findings in female hygiene products, urogenital health research, and method development. The clinical research team focused on utilizing the results of clinical safety studies to advance the acceptance of feminine hygiene products world-wide. Key findings include that perception of skin sensitivity is not limited to the facial area, but is also relevant to the body and the genital area. Also, they shed light on the role of estrogen in autoimmune diseases as well as premenstrual syndrome. Efforts in the method development area focused on innovative tools that are reliable, predictive of clinical trial results and capable of measuring wear comfort, genital skin health, and the impact of product use on the consumer's quality of life. A novel method, behind-the-knee (BTK) test, developed to model irritation under normal wear conditions, was the first to account for both chemical and mechanical sources of irritation. The method has been accepted by the FDA as a substitute in clinical trials in some cases, and by American Society for Testing and Materials as a global standard test method. Additional proprietary methods were developed to enhance visual grading of irritation using cross-polarized light, to measure the amount of lotion transferred from sanitary pads, and to evaluate the skin mildness. Finally, the Farage Quality of Life tool was created to measure consumer's well-being. Based on the results of this extensive clinical research and the newly developed testing methods, the changing needs of women throughout their life stages are better met.",

        "Title": "Properties of networks with partially structured and partially random connectivity.",
        "Abstract": "Networks studied in many disciplines, including neuroscience and mathematical biology, have connectivity that may be stochastic about some underlying mean connectivity represented by a non-normal matrix. Furthermore, the stochasticity may not be independent and identically distributed (iid) across elements of the connectivity matrix. More generally, the problem of understanding the behavior of stochastic matrices with nontrivial mean structure and correlations arises in many settings. We address this by characterizing large random N\u00d7N matrices of the form A=M+LJR, where M,L, and R are arbitrary deterministic matrices and J is a random matrix of zero-mean iid elements. M can be non-normal, and L and R allow correlations that have separable dependence on row and column indices. We first provide a general formula for the eigenvalue density of A. For A non-normal, the eigenvalues do not suffice to specify the dynamics induced by A, so we also provide general formulas for the transient evolution of the magnitude of activity and frequency power spectrum in an N-dimensional linear dynamical system with a coupling matrix given by A. These quantities can also be thought of as characterizing the stability and the magnitude of the linear response of a nonlinear network to small perturbations about a fixed point. We derive these formulas and work them out analytically for some examples of M,L, and R motivated by neurobiological models. We also argue that the persistence as N\u2192\u221e of a finite number of randomly distributed outlying eigenvalues outside the support of the eigenvalue density of A, as previously observed, arises in regions of the complex plane \u03a9 where there are nonzero singular values of L(-1)(z1-M)R(-1) (for z\u2208\u03a9) that vanish as N\u2192\u221e. When such singular values do not exist and L and R are equal to the identity, there is a correspondence in the normalized Frobenius norm (but not in the operator norm) between the support of the spectrum of A for J of norm \u03c3 and the \u03c3 pseudospectrum of M.",

        "Abstract": "Neighboring neurons in cat primary visual cortex (V1) have similar preferred orientation, direction, and spatial frequency. How diverse is their degree of tuning for these properties? To address this, we used single-tetrode recordings to simultaneously isolate multiple cells at single recording sites and record their responses to flashed and drifting gratings of multiple orientations, spatial frequencies, and, for drifting gratings, directions. Orientation tuning width, spatial frequency tuning width, and direction selectivity index (DSI) all showed significant clustering: pairs of neurons recorded at a single site were significantly more similar in each of these properties than pairs of neurons from different recording sites. The strength of the clustering was generally modest. The percent decrease in the median difference between pairs from the same site, relative to pairs from different sites, was as follows: for different measures of orientation tuning width, 29-35% (drifting gratings) or 15-25% (flashed gratings); for DSI, 24%; and for spatial frequency tuning width measured in octaves, 8% (drifting gratings). The clusterings of all of these measures were much weaker than for preferred orientation (68% decrease) but comparable to that seen for preferred spatial frequency in response to drifting gratings (26%). For the above properties, little difference in clustering was seen between simple and complex cells. In studies of spatial frequency tuning to flashed gratings, strong clustering was seen among simple-cell pairs for tuning width (70% decrease) and preferred frequency (71% decrease), whereas no clustering was seen for simple-complex or complex-complex cell pairs.",

        "Abstract": "Neurons in sensory cortex integrate multiple influences to parse objects and support perception. Across multiple cortical areas, integration is characterized by two neuronal response properties: (1) surround suppression--modulatory contextual stimuli suppress responses to driving stimuli; and (2) \"normalization\"--responses to multiple driving stimuli add sublinearly. These depend on input strength: for weak driving stimuli, contextual influences facilitate or more weakly suppress and summation becomes linear or supralinear. Understanding the circuit operations underlying integration is critical to understanding cortical function and disease. We present a simple, general theory. A wealth of integrative properties, including the above, emerge robustly from four cortical circuit properties: (1) supralinear neuronal input/output functions; (2) sufficiently strong recurrent excitation; (3) feedback inhibition; and (4) simple spatial properties of intracortical connections. Integrative properties emerge dynamically as circuit properties, with excitatory and inhibitory neurons showing similar behaviors. In new recordings in visual cortex, we confirm key model predictions.",

        "Abstract": "Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter, released by primary sensory peripheral nerve and spinal synaptic terminals during nociceptive (pain) signaling. The primary source of neurotransmitter, glutamate, is provided from its synthetic enzyme, glutaminase (GLS). Neurotransmitter glutamate is packaged into synaptic vesicles in nociceptive neurons by the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2). Little is known, however, what effect a surgical incision has on GLS and VGluT2 in primary afferent neurons. In this study, an aseptic, midline incision in the proximal one-third of the rat-tail was examined to determine whether sacral dorsal root ganglia innervate the area of surgical incision, utilizing the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold\u2122. Subsequently, the amount of VGluT2 and GLS immunoreactivity (IR) in sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) was evaluated using immunofluorescence with image analysis and Western immunoblotting with density analysis. GLS messenger RNA (mRNA) changes were evaluated using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT",

        "Abstract": "Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity together refine neural circuitry, but their interactions are unclear. In most existing models, each form of plasticity directly modifies synaptic strength. Equilibrium is reached when the two are inducing equal and opposite changes. We show that such models cannot reproduce ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) because negative feedback from the slow homeostatic plasticity observed in ODP cannot stabilize the positive feedback of fast Hebbian plasticity. We propose a model in which synaptic strength is the product of a synapse-specific Hebbian factor and a postsynaptic-cell-specific homeostatic factor, with each factor separately arriving at a stable inactive state. This model captures ODP dynamics and has plausible biophysical substrates. We confirm model predictions experimentally that plasticity is inactive at stable states and that synaptic strength overshoots during recovery from visual deprivation. These results highlight the importance of multiple regulatory pathways for interactions of plasticity mechanisms operating over separate timescales.",

        "Abstract": "Earth's climate underwent a major transition from the warmth of the late Pliocene, when global surface temperatures were ~2\u00b0 to 3\u00b0C higher than today, to extensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation (NHG) ~2.73 million years ago (Ma). We show that North Pacific deep waters were substantially colder (4\u00b0C) and probably fresher than the North Atlantic Deep Water before the intensification of NHG. At ~2.73 Ma, the Atlantic-Pacific temperature gradient was reduced to <1\u00b0C, suggesting the initiation of stronger heat transfer from the North Atlantic to the deep Pacific. We posit that increased glaciation of Antarctica, deduced from the 21 \u00b1 10-meter sea-level fall from 3.15 to 2.75 Ma, and the development of a strong polar halocline fundamentally altered deep ocean circulation, which enhanced interhemispheric heat and salt transport, thereby contributing to NHG.",

        "Abstract": "We examine the effects of short-term synaptic depression on the orientation tuning of the LGN input to simple cells in cat primary visual cortex (V1). The total LGN input has an untuned component as well as a tuned component, both of which grow with stimulus contrast. The untuned component is not visible in the firing rate responses of the simple cells. The suppression of the contribution of the untuned input component to firing rate responses is key to establishing orientation selectivity and its invariance with stimulus contrast. It has been argued that synaptic depression of LGN inputs could contribute to the selective suppression of the untuned component and thus contribute to the tuning observed in simple cells. We examine this using a model fit to the depression observed at thalamocortical synapses in-vivo, and compare this to an earlier model fit based on in-vitro observations. We examine the tuning of both the conductance and the firing rate induced in simple cells by the net LGN input. We find that depression causes minimal suppression of the untuned component. The primary effect of depression is to cause the contrast response curve to saturate at lower contrasts without differentially affecting the tuned vs. untuned components. This effect is slightly weaker for in-vivo vs. in-vitro parameters. Thus, synaptic depression of LGN inputs does not appreciably contribute to the orientation tuning of V1 simple cells.",

However, other sites of primary involvement do occur and can present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We present an unusual case of HCL involving predominantly the breast that was diagnosed as an incidental finding during an elective reduction mammoplasty in an otherwise healthy asymptomatic woman. Bone marrow performed for staging revealed limited involvement by HCL. Notably, there was no splenomegaly and/or involvement of other extramedullary sites. The peripheral blood revealed minimal involvement detected by flow cytometry. Extensive immunohistochemical studies supported by positive BRAF V600E mutational status confirmed the diagnosis of HCL. The patient remains asymptomatic without treatment one year following the diagnosis. This is the first case of a well-documented HCL presenting primarily in the breast in an asymptomatic patient. We review the literature on extramedullary, extrasplenic involvement by HCL and discuss the diagnostic challenges as well as the utility of immunohistochemistry and molecular studies in the diagnosis of atypical presentations of HCL.",

Just as the principles of the medical home have been an integral part of nurse practitioners' practice, so has the concept of whole person orientation incorporating both physical and mental or behavioral health care. It is therefore encouraging that organized medicine has embraced integrated physical and behavioral health care in patient-centered medical homes, a position that could help improve the wellbeing of patients all throughout the United States. Although the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) has long supported such integration, we do not support the physician-centric joint principles included in the current issue of Annals of Family Medicine (The Working Party Group on Integrated Behavioral Healthcare et al., 2014), as they create provider and leadership roles that are too narrow and restrictive for the provision of health care in the 21st century. As written, they limit access to high-quality care and restrict patient choice of health care providers.",

        "Abstract": "Of all of the sensory areas, barrel cortex is among the best understood in terms of circuitry, yet least understood in terms of sensory function. We combined intracellular recording in rats with a multi-directional, multi-whisker stimulator system to estimate receptive fields by reverse correlation of stimuli to synaptic inputs. Spatiotemporal receptive fields were identified orders of magnitude faster than by conventional spike-based approaches, even for neurons with little spiking activity. Given a suitable stimulus representation, a linear model captured the stimulus-response relationship for all neurons with high accuracy. In contrast with conventional single-whisker stimuli, complex stimuli revealed markedly sharpened receptive fields, largely as a result of adaptation. This phenomenon allowed the surround to facilitate rather than to suppress responses to the principal whisker. Optimized stimuli enhanced firing in layers 4-6, but not in layers 2/3, which remained sparsely active. Surround facilitation through adaptation may be required for discriminating complex shapes and textures during natural sensing.",

        "Abstract": "Many medial septal neurons of the basal forebrain are dependent on nerve growth factor (NGF) from the hippocampus for survival and maintenance of a cholinergic phenotype. When deprived of their source of NGF by axotomy, medial septal neuronal cell bodies atrophy and lose their cholinergic markers. This is similar to what is observed in the basal forebrain during Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, medial septal neurons were axotomized in female rats by way of a fimbria/fornix lesion. For fourteen days following axotomy, varying NGF doses (1 - 250 \u03bcg/ml) were administered to the lateral cerebral ventricle with either mini-osmotic infusion or daily injection. The responsiveness of medial septal neurons was evaluated with choline acetyltransferase immunohistochemistry. Within the mini-osmotic pumps, NGF activity diminished greatly during the first five days of implantation, but increased dramatically in the CSF after five days of infusion. The responsiveness of medial septal neurons to NGF was dose dependent and the ED",

        "Title": "A novel CaM kinase II pathway controls the location of neuropeptide release from Caenorhabditis elegans motor neurons.",
        "Abstract": "Neurons release neuropeptides via the regulated exocytosis of dense core vesicles (DCVs) to evoke or modulate behaviors. We found that Caenorhabditis elegans motor neurons send most of their DCVs to axons, leaving very few in the cell somas. How neurons maintain this skewed distribution and the extent to which it can be altered to control DCV numbers in axons or to drive release from somas for different behavioral impacts is unknown. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified loss-of-function mutations in UNC-43 (CaM kinase II) that reduce axonal DCV levels by \u223c90% and cell soma/dendrite DCV levels by \u223c80%, leaving small synaptic vesicles largely unaffected. Blocking regulated secretion in unc-43 mutants restored near wild-type axonal levels of DCVs. Time-lapse video microscopy showed no role for CaM kinase II in the transport of DCVs from cell somas to axons. In vivo secretion assays revealed that much of the missing neuropeptide in unc-43 mutants is secreted via a regulated secretory pathway requiring UNC-31 (CAPS) and UNC-18 (nSec1). DCV cargo levels in unc-43 mutants are similarly low in cell somas and the axon initial segment, indicating that the secretion occurs prior to axonal transport. Genetic pathway analysis suggests that abnormal neuropeptide function contributes to the sluggish basal locomotion rate of unc-43 mutants. These results reveal a novel pathway controlling the location of DCV exocytosis and describe a major new function for CaM kinase II.",

        "Title": "Thermal sensitivity of DASH interferometers: the role of thermal effects during the calibration of an Echelle DASH interferometer.",
        "Abstract": "The use of a Doppler asymmetric spatial heterodyne (DASH) interferometer with an Echelle grating provides the ability to simultaneously image the 558 and 630 nm emission lines (e.g., at grating orders of n=8 and n=7, respectively) of atomic oxygen in the thermosphere. By measuring the Doppler shifts of these lines (expected relative change in wavelength on the order of 10\u207b\u2078), we are able to determine the thermospheric winds. Because the expected wavelength changes due to the Doppler shift are so small, understanding, monitoring, and accounting for thermal effects is expected to be important. Previously, the thermal behavior of a temperature-compensated monolithic DASH interferometer was found to have a higher thermal sensitivity than predicted by a simple model [Opt. Express 18, 26430, 2010]. A follow-up study [Opt. Express 20, 9535, 2012] suggested that this is due to thermal distortion of the interferometer, which consists of materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion. In this work, we characterize the thermal drift of a nonmonolithic Echelle DASH interferometer and discuss the implications of these results on the use of only a single wavelength source during calibration. Furthermore, we perform a finite element analysis of the earlier monolithic interferometer in order to determine how distortion would affect the thermal sensitivity of that device. Incorporating that data into the model, we find good agreement between the modified model and the measured thermal sensitivities. These findings emphasize the fact that distortion needs to be considered for the design of thermally compensated, monolithic DASH interferometers.",

        "Abstract": "The indications for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) continue to expand. However, the risk for pulmonary complications post-HSCT continues to be high. Early recognition and treatment of pulmonary complications may improve outcomes. This is an overview of diagnosis, manifestations, and treatment of the most common infectious and noninfectious pulmonary complications post-HSCT. Knowing the patient's timeframe post-HSCT (preengraftment, postengraftment, late), type of HSCT (allogeneic vs autologous), radiographic findings, and clinical presentation can help to differentiate between the many pulmonary complications. This article will also address pretransplantation evaluation and infectious and noninfectious complications in the patient post-HSCT. While mortality post-HSCT continues to improve, respiratory failure continues to be the leading cause of ICU admissions for patients who have undergone HSCT. Mechanical ventilation is a predictor of poor outcomes in these patients, and further research is needed regarding their critical care management, treatment options for noninfectious pulmonary complications, and mortality prediction models posttransplantation.",

        "Abstract": "What causes critical periods (CPs) to open? For the best-studied case, ocular dominance plasticity in primary visual cortex in response to monocular deprivation (MD), the maturation of inhibition is necessary and sufficient. How does inhibition open the CP? We present a theory: the transition from pre-CP to CP plasticity arises because inhibition preferentially suppresses responses to spontaneous relative to visually driven input activity, switching learning cues from internal to external sources. This differs from previous proposals in (1) arguing that the CP can open without changes in plasticity mechanisms when activity patterns become more sensitive to sensory experience through circuit development, and (2) explaining not simply a transition from no plasticity to plasticity, but a change in outcome of MD-induced plasticity from pre-CP to CP. More broadly, hierarchical organization of sensory-motor pathways may develop through a cascade of CPs induced as circuit maturation progresses from \"lower\" to \"higher\" cortical areas.",

        "Abstract": "The LIVESTRONG Centers of Excellence were funded to increase the effectiveness of survivorship care in oncology practice. This study describes the ongoing process of adopting and implementing survivorship care using the framework of the diffusion of innovation theory of change. Primary data collection included telephone interviews with 39 members from the eight centers and site visits. Organizational characteristics, overall progress, and challenges for implementation were collected from proposals and annual reports. Creating an awareness of cancer survivorship care was a major accomplishment (relative advantage). Adoption depended on the fit within the cancer center (compatibility), and changed over time based on trial and error (trialability). Implementing survivorship care within the existing culture of oncology and breaking down resistance to change was a lengthy process (complexity). Survivorship care became sustainable as it became reimbursed, and more new patients were seen (observability). Innovators and early adopters were crucial to success. Diffusion of innovation theory can provide a strategy to evaluate adoption and implementation of cancer survivorship programs into clinical practice.",

        "Abstract": "Low- and medium-resource countries are facing a significant increase in the incidence of noncommunicable diseases such as cancer. Unfortunately, the majority of patients with cancer present with advanced disease, and disease-directed treatment may be unlikely to be effective and/or not available. Globally, there will be a growing need for palliative care services. There has been significant progress in the provision and integration of palliative care into the health care policy and systems. Nonetheless, palliative care services vary significantly between regions of the world and also between countries in the same region. Some common barriers to care include the lack of a trained workforce to provide palliative care, lack of availability of opioids or the restriction of their use, cultural attitudes of physicians and patients, and also funding. Despite these challenges, there are examples of low- and medium-resource countries that are providing excellent palliative care that is being integrated into the health care system and the cancer care continuum. This article provides an overview of the progress in providing palliative care in low- and medium-resource countries. In addition, more specific information is provided on palliative care in low-resource countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Finally, a more personal perspective is presented on the development of palliative care in Ethiopia, as an example.",

        "Title": "Symptoms and symptom management in long-term cancer survivors.",
        "Abstract": "It is estimated that there are 13 million cancer survivors in the United States, and more than 65% of them are 5 or more years beyond their diagnosis. The majority are \"cancer-free and free of cancer,\" although some survivors have late or long-term effects of treatment or develop second or secondary cancers. Late and long-term effects for survivors of childhood cancers have been well studied, but less is known about the \"seasons of survivorship\" for adult cancer survivors. Symptoms during diagnosis, treatment, and then extending through the first several years of survivorship were reported in more than half of a large and heterogeneous group of cancer survivors. The incidence of late and/or long-term symptoms and health problems of long-term cancer survivors is less well characterized. These persistent symptoms are related to survivors' cancer diagnosis and the treatment they received, as well as age and other comorbidities. Health-related quality of life generally is stable for many years, although some cancer survivors experience a significant drop in health-related quality of life years after treatment, although the etiology is not clear yet. This article provides an overview of the natural history of cancer survivorship (\"The seasons of survivorship\"), disease-specific toxicities, and changes in symptoms in cancer survivors over time. Several common symptoms are used as examples including pain, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "We study a rate-model neural network composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in which neuronal input-output functions are power laws with a power greater than 1, as observed in primary visual cortex. This supralinear input-output function leads to supralinear summation of network responses to multiple inputs for weak inputs. We show that for stronger inputs, which would drive the excitatory subnetwork to instability, the network will dynamically stabilize provided feedback inhibition is sufficiently strong. For a wide range of network and stimulus parameters, this dynamic stabilization yields a transition from supralinear to sublinear summation of network responses to multiple inputs. We compare this to the dynamic stabilization in the balanced network, which yields only linear behavior. We more exhaustively analyze the two-dimensional case of one excitatory and one inhibitory population. We show that in this case, dynamic stabilization will occur whenever the determinant of the weight matrix is positive and the inhibitory time constant is sufficiently small, and analyze the conditions for supersaturation, or decrease of firing rates with increasing stimulus contrast (which represents increasing input firing rates). In work to be presented elsewhere, we have found that this transition from supralinear to sublinear summation can explain a wide variety of nonlinearities in cerebral cortical processing.",

        "Abstract": "Neurons must cope with extreme membrane trafficking demands to produce axons with organelle compositions that differ dramatically from those of the cell soma and dendrites; however, the mechanism by which they accomplish this is not understood. Here we use electron microscopy and quantitative imaging of tagged organelles to show that Caenorhabditis elegans axons lacking UNC-16 (JIP3/Sunday Driver) accumulate Golgi, endosomes, and lysosomes at levels up to 10-fold higher than wild type, while ER membranes are largely unaffected. Time lapse microscopy of tagged lysosomes in living animals and an analysis of lysosome distributions in various regions of unc-16 mutant axons revealed that UNC-16 inhibits organelles from escaping the axon initial segment (AIS) and moving to the distal synaptic part of the axon. Immunostaining of native UNC-16 in C. elegans neurons revealed a localized concentration of UNC-16 at the initial segment, although UNC-16 is also sparsely distributed in distal regions of axons, including the synaptic region. Organelles that escape the AIS in unc-16 mutants show bidirectional active transport within the axon commissure that occasionally deposits them in the synaptic region, where their mobility decreases and they accumulate. These results argue against the long-standing, untested hypothesis that JIP3/Sunday Driver promotes anterograde organelle transport in axons and instead suggest an organelle gatekeeper model in which UNC-16 (JIP3/Sunday Driver) selectively inhibits the escape of Golgi and endosomal organelles from the AIS. This is the first evidence for an organelle gatekeeper function at the AIS, which could provide a regulatory node for controlling axon organelle composition.",

        "Abstract": "Antibodies have become the fastest growing class of biological therapeutics, in part due to their exquisite specificity and ability to modulate protein-protein interactions with a high biological potency. The relatively large size and bivalency of antibodies, however, limits their use as therapeutics in certain circumstances. Antibody fragments, such as single-chain variable fragments and antigen binding-fragments, have emerged as viable alternatives, but without further modifications these monovalent formats have reduced terminal serum half-lives because of their small size and lack of an Fc domain, which is required for FcRn-mediated recycling. Using rational engineering of the IgG4 Fc domain to disrupt key interactions at the CH3-CH3 interface, we identified a number of point mutations that abolish Fc dimerization and created half-antibodies, a novel monovalent antibody format that retains a monomeric Fc domain. Introduction of these mutations into an IgG1 framework also led to the creation of half-antibodies. These half-antibodies were shown to be soluble, thermodynamically stable and monomeric, characteristics that are favorable for use as therapeutic proteins. Despite significantly reduced FcRn binding in vitro, which suggests that avidity gains in a dimeric Fc are critical to optimal FcRn binding, this format demonstrated an increased terminal serum half-life compared with that expected for most alternative antibody fragments.",

Our results show that (+)-sattabacin potently inhibits the growth of VZV at concentrations in the range of other drugs commonly prescribed for VZV infection. Experiments detailing the synthesis of (+)-sattabacin, quantification of cytotoxicity and gene expression data in human fibroblast cells are also presented. Gene expression data was obtained through microarray analysis from human fibroblast cells exposed to sattabacin in order to identify a possible mechanism by which (+)-sattabacin inhibits VZV replication.",

        "Abstract": "Colposcopic inspection of the vagina is a routine component of the safety assessment of intravaginal products. However, colposcopic findings occur frequently in healthy women, raising questions about their relevance to intravaginal product safety. Practical disadvantages limit the utility of colposcopy for evaluating menstrual tampons, among them the presence of background microtrauma, the inability to assess effects during menstruation, and, importantly, the question of whether post hoc assessments are sufficiently sensitive to detect small inflammatory changes. The Behind-The-Knee (BTK) test is an alternative for evaluating inflammatory and tissue dryness effects of physical articles by their repeated application to the popliteal fossa under an elastic bandage. It enables concurrent parallel comparisons of experimental and control articles over time and substantially increases the sensitivity of detecting small changes in tissue inflammation.",

In the last two decades, a number of instruments have been developed for use among general dermatology patients to assess the effects of treatment and disease progression, perceptions of well-being, and the value that patients place on their dermatologic state of health. This chapter reviews some health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (HRQoL) measures developed and validated specifically for dermatological conditions. However, opportunity exists for developing and validating HRQoL measures specifically for dermatological conditions most pertinent to older patients. \u00a0",

As people age, gradual changes ensue in vision, hearing, balance, coordination, and memory. Products, communication materials, and the physical environment must be thoughtfully designed to meet the needs of people of all ages. This article summarizes normal changes in sensory function, mobility, balance, memory, and attention that occur with age. It presents practical guidelines that allow design professionals to accommodate these changes and better meet the needs of older adults. Designing for older adults is inclusive design: it accommodates a range of physical and cognitive abilities and promotes simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use for people of any age.",

Most DRG neurons are glutamatergic, using glutaminase as the enzyme for glutamate production, but little is known about glutaminase following inflammation. In the present study, adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) was produced in rats with complete Freund's adjuvant into the hindpaw. At 7 days of AIA, DRG were examined with glutaminase immunohistochemistry, Western blot immunoreactivity, and enzyme activity. Image analysis revealed that glutaminase was elevated most in small-sized neurons (21%) (P < 0.05). Western blot analysis revealed a 19% increase (P < 0.05) in total glutaminase and 21% in mitochondrial glutaminase (P < 0.05). Glutaminase enzyme activity was elevated 29% (P < 0.001) from 2.20 to 2.83\u2009moles/kg/hr. Elevated glutaminase in primary sensory neurons could lead to increased glutamate production in spinal primary afferent terminals contributing to central sensitization or in the peripheral process contributing to peripheral sensitization.",

        "Abstract": "The concept of targeting cancer therapeutics toward specific mutations or abnormalities in tumor cells, which are not found in normal tissues, has the potential advantages of high selectivity for the tumor and correspondingly low secondary toxicities. Many human malignancies display activating mutations in the Ras family of signal-transducing genes or over-activity of p21(Ras)-signaling pathways. Carcinoid and other neuroendocrine tumors have been similarly demonstrated to have activation of Ras signaling directly by mutations in Ras, indirectly by loss of Ras-regulatory proteins, or via constitutive activation of upstream or downstream effector pathways of Ras, such as growth factor receptors or PI(3)-kinase and Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinases. We previously reported that aberrant activation of Ras signaling sensitizes cells to apoptosis when the activity of the PKC\u03b4 isozyme is suppressed and that PKC\u03b4 suppression is not toxic to cells with normal levels of p21(Ras) signaling. We demonstrate here that inhibition of PKC\u03b4 by a number of independent means, including genetic mechanisms (shRNA) or small-molecule inhibitors, is able to efficiently and selectively repress the growth of human neuroendocrine cell lines derived from bronchopulmonary, foregut, or hindgut tumors. PKC\u03b4 inhibition in these tumors also efficiently induced apoptosis. Exposure to small-molecule inhibitors of PKC\u03b4 over a period of 24 \u200ah is sufficient to significantly suppress cell growth and clonogenic capacity of these tumor cell lines. Neuroendocrine tumors are typically refractory to conventional therapeutic approaches. This Ras-targeted therapeutic approach, mediated through PKC\u03b4 suppression, which selectively takes advantage of the very oncogenic mutations that contribute to the malignancy of the tumor, may hold potential as a novel therapeutic modality.",

        "Abstract": "This paper reports a systematic study of the level of flavan-3-ol monomers during typical processing steps as cacao beans are dried, fermented and roasted and the results of Dutch-processing. Methods have been used that resolve the stereoisomers of epicatechin and catechin. In beans harvested from unripe and ripe cacao pods, we find only (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin with (-)-epicatechin being by far the predominant isomer. When beans are fermented there is a large loss of both (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin, but also the formation of (-)-catechin. We hypothesize that the heat of fermentation may, in part, be responsible for the formation of this enantiomer. When beans are progressively roasted at conditions described as low, medium and high roast conditions, there is a progressive loss of (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin and an increase in (-)-catechin with the higher roast levels. When natural and Dutch-processed cacao powders are analyzed, there is progressive loss of both (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin with lesser losses of (-)-catechin. We thus observe that in even lightly Dutch-processed powder, the level of (-)-catechin exceeds the level of (-)-epicatechin. The results indicate that much of the increase in the level of (-)-catechin observed during various processing steps may be the result of heat-related epimerization from (-)-epicatechin. These results are discussed with reference to the reported preferred order of absorption of (-)-epicatechin > (+)-catechin > (-)-catechin. These results are also discussed with respect to the balance that must be struck between the beneficial impact of fermentation and roasting on chocolate flavor and the healthful benefits of chocolate and cocoa powder that result in part from the flavan-3-ol monomers.",

        "Abstract": "Global cooling and the development of continental-scale Antarctic glaciation occurred in the late middle Eocene to early Oligocene (~38 to 28 million years ago), accompanied by deep-ocean reorganization attributed to gradual Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) development. Our benthic foraminiferal stable isotope comparisons show that a large \u03b4(13)C offset developed between mid-depth (~600 meters) and deep (>1000 meters) western North Atlantic waters in the early Oligocene, indicating the development of intermediate-depth \u03b4(13)C and O(2) minima closely linked in the modern ocean to northward incursion of Antarctic Intermediate Water. At the same time, the ocean's coldest waters became restricted to south of the ACC, probably forming a bottom-ocean layer, as in the modern ocean. We show that the modern four-layer ocean structure (surface, intermediate, deep, and bottom waters) developed during the early Oligocene as a consequence of the ACC.",

        "Abstract": "The effectiveness and safety of valsartan have not been assessed in hypertensive children. Therefore, hypertensive patients aged 6 to 16 years (n=261) were randomized to receive weight-stratified low- (10/20 mg), medium- (40/80 mg), or high-dose (80/160 mg) valsartan for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, patients were randomized to a 2-week placebo-controlled withdrawal phase. Dose-dependent reductions in sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP) and sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) were observed after 2 weeks (low dose, -7.9/-4.6 mm Hg; medium dose, -9.6/-5.8 mm Hg; high dose, -11.5/-7.4 mm Hg [P<.0001 for all groups]). During the withdrawal phase, SSBP and SDBP were both lower in the pooled valsartan group than in the pooled placebo group (SSBP, -2.7 mm Hg [P=.0368]; SDBP, -3.0 mm Hg [P=.0047]). Similar efficacy was observed in all subgroups. Valsartan was well tolerated and headache was the most commonly observed adverse event during both the double-blind and 52-week open-label phases.",

        "Abstract": "BCR-ABL is a key mediator in the pathogenesis of all cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a subset of precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL). Previous animal and cell-based studies have shown that the expression of members of the Forkhead family of tumor suppressors, including FoxO3, is suppressed in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. Furthermore, it has been reported that the proteasomal degradation pathway plays an important role in suppression of FoxO expression in BCR-ABL-transformed cells. In this study, a patient diagnosed with Ph+ALL and refractory to standard therapies was treated with a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib)-based chemotherapy regimen. This treatment resulted in complete hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular remission with excellent performance status for > 4 years since her initial diagnosis. FoxO3 was not detectable within the blasts of this patient at diagnosis and was 'rescued' following treatment with bortezomib therapy, leading to her recovery. As a next step, in the attempt to propose FoXO3 as a therapeutic target and a theranostic marker, we further validated FoxO3 expression in human bone marrow biopsy samples. Human core biopsy samples of Ph+ALL and Ph-negative-negative ALL, along with uninvolved controls, revealed that FoxO3 down-regulation was specific to Ph+ALL. This study provides support that FoxO3 is a good biomarker for BCR-ABL-mediated leukemogenesis. Additionally, proteasomal inhibition by bortezomib may be a promising therapeutic option in Philadelphia-positive ALL, where FoxO3 is downregulated.",

        "Abstract": "In addition to using glutamate as a neurotransmitter at central synapses, many primary sensory neurons release glutamate from peripheral terminals. Primary sensory neurons with cell bodies in dorsal root or trigeminal ganglia produce glutaminase, the synthetic enzyme for glutamate, and transport the enzyme in mitochondria to peripheral terminals. Vesicular glutamate transporters fill neurotransmitter vesicles with glutamate and they are shipped to peripheral terminals. Intense noxious stimuli or tissue damage causes glutamate to be released from peripheral afferent nerve terminals and augmented release occurs during acute and chronic inflammation. The site of action for glutamate can be at the autologous or nearby nerve terminals. Peripheral nerve terminals contain both ionotropic and metabotropic excitatory amino acid receptors (EAARs) and activation of these receptors can lower the activation threshold and increase the excitability of primary afferents. Antagonism of EAARs can reduce excitability of activated afferents and produce antinociception in many animal models of acute and chronic pain. Glutamate injected into human skin and muscle causes acute pain. Trauma in humans, such as arthritis, myalgia, and tendonitis, elevates glutamate levels in affected tissues. There is evidence that EAAR antagonism at peripheral sites can provide relief in some chronic pain sufferers.",

        "Title": "HID-1, a new component of the peptidergic signaling pathway.",
        "Abstract": "hid-1 was originally identified as a Caenorhabditis elegans gene encoding a novel conserved protein that regulates the decision to enter into the enduring dauer larval stage. We isolated a novel allele of hid-1 in a forward genetic screen for mutants mislocalizing RBF-1 rabphilin, a RAB-27 effector. Here we demonstrate that HID-1 functions in the nervous system to regulate neuromuscular signaling and in the intestine to regulate the defecation motor program. We further show that a conserved N-terminal myristoylated motif of both invertebrate and vertebrate HID-1 is essential for its association with intracellular membranes in nematodes and PC12 cells. C. elegans neuronal HID-1 resides on intracellular membranes in neuronal cell somas; however, the kinesin UNC-104 also transports HID-1 to synaptic regions. HID-1 accumulates in the axons of unc-13 and unc-31 mutants, suggesting it is associated with neurosecretory vesicles. Consistent with this, genetic studies place HID-1 in a peptidergic signaling pathway. Finally, a hid-1 null mutation reduces the levels of endogenous neuropeptides and alters the secretion of fluorescent-tagged cargos derived from neuronal and intestinal dense core vesicles (DCVs). Taken together, our findings indicate that HID-1 is a novel component of a DCV-based neurosecretory pathway and that it regulates one or more aspects of the biogenesis, maturation, or trafficking of DCVs.",

        "Abstract": "This report describes the development of a potency ELISA using a peptide derived from the motavizumab binding epitope of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F-protein. Motavizumab is an antibody therapeutic studied for the prevention of RSV disease. It binds to the RSV glycoprotein F (F-protein), blocking the ability of RSV to fuse with target cells. This binding is the basis for a potency ELISA, however, due to inefficient F-protein production, development of an alternative ligand for the potency ELISA was investigated. A series of synthetic peptides spanning the motavizumab epitope on F-protein were evaluated for motavizumab binding activity. A 26-mer peptide was identified with desirable motavizumab binding kinetics, as shown by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance. The peptide corresponds to a portion of the motavizumab binding domain on the F-protein, and is referred to as F-peptide. The binding of motavizumab to the F-peptide is used in a new motavizumab potency ELISA, which was shown to be robust and statistically comparable to the F-protein ELISA. In addition, based on a qualitative observation, this new ELISA may be able to detect motavizumab degradation with greater sensitivity compared to the F-protein ELISA.",

        "Title": "Chronic suppression of phosphodiesterase 10A alters striatal expression of genes responsible for neurotransmitter synthesis, neurotransmission, and signaling pathways implicated in Huntington's disease.",
        "Abstract": "Inhibition of phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) promotes cyclic nucleotide signaling, increases striatal activation, and decreases behavioral activity. Enhanced cyclic nucleotide signaling is a well established route to producing changes in gene expression. We hypothesized that chronic suppression of PDE10A activity would have significant effects on gene expression in the striatum. A comparison of the expression profile of PDE10A knockout (KO) mice and wild-type mice after chronic PDE10A inhibition revealed altered expression of 19 overlapping genes with few significant changes outside the striatum or after administration of a PDE10A inhibitor to KO animals. Chronic inhibition of PDE10A produced up-regulation of mRNAs encoding genes that included prodynorphin, synaptotagmin10, phosphodiesterase 1C, glutamate decarboxylase 1, and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase and a down-regulation of mRNAs encoding choline acetyltransferase and Kv1.6, suggesting long-term suppression of the PDE10A enzyme is consistent with altered striatal excitability and potential utility as a antipsychotic therapy. In addition, up-regulation of mRNAs encoding histone 3 (H3) and down-regulation of histone deacetylase 4, follistatin, and claspin mRNAs suggests activation of molecular cascades capable of neuroprotection. We used lentiviral delivery of cAMP response element (CRE)-luciferase reporter constructs into the striatum and live animal imaging of 2-{4-[-pyridin-4-yl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoro-ethyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]-phenoxymethyl}-quinoline succinic acid (TP-10)-induced luciferase activity to further demonstrate PDE10 inhibition results in CRE-mediated transcription. Consistent with potential neuroprotective cascades, we also demonstrate phosphorylation of mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 and H3 in vivo after TP-10 treatment. The observed changes in signaling and gene expression are predicted to provide neuroprotective effects in models of Huntington's disease.",

        "Abstract": "No international research community, cell biology included, can exist without an educational community to renew and replenish it. Unfortunately, cell biology researchers frequently regard their work as independent of the process of education and see little reason to reach out to science teachers. For cell biology to continue to prosper, I argue that researchers must support education in at least three ways. First, we must view education and research as part of a single scientific community. Second, we should take advantage of new technologies to connect the research laboratory to the classroom. Finally, we must take the initiative in defending the integrity of science teaching, particularly when education is under attack for political or religious reasons.",

        "Title": "Impact of fermentation, drying, roasting, and Dutch processing on epicatechin and catechin content of cacao beans and cocoa ingredients.",
        "Abstract": "Low molecular weight flavan-3-ols are thought to be responsible, in part, for the cardiovascular benefits associated with cocoa powder and dark chocolate. The levels of epicatechin and catechin were determined in raw and conventionally fermented cacao beans and during conventional processing, which included drying, roasting, and Dutch (alkali) processing. Unripe cacao beans had 29% higher levels of epicatechin and the same level of catechin compared to fully ripe beans. Drying had minimal effect on the epicatechin and catechin levels. Substantial decreases (>80%) in catechin and epicatechin levels were observed in fermented versus unfermented beans. When both Ivory Coast and Papua New Guinea beans were subjected to roasting under controlled conditions, there was a distinct loss of epicatechin when bean temperatures exceeded 70 \u00b0C. When cacao beans were roasted to 120 \u00b0C, the catechin level in beans increased by 696% in unfermented beans, by 650% in Ivory Coast beans, and by 640% in Papua New Guinea fermented beans compared to the same unroasted beans. These results suggest that roasting in excess of 70 \u00b0C generates significant amounts of (-)-catechin, probably due to epimerization of (-)-epicatechin. Compared to natural cocoa powders, Dutch processing caused a loss in both epicatechin (up to 98%) and catechin (up to 80%). The epicatechin/catechin ratio is proposed as a useful and sensitive indicator for the processing history of cacao beans.",

Herein, we report the first biosynthetic gene cluster for this class of fungal alkaloids based on whole genome sequencing of a marine-derived Aspergillus sp. Two central pathway enzymes catalyzing both normal and reverse prenyltransfer reactions were characterized in detail. Our results establish the early steps for creation of the prenylated indole alkaloid structure and suggest a scheme for the biosynthesis of stephacidin and notoamide metabolites.

        "Abstract": "Daily stressors may mediate the relation between exposure to disaster-related stressors and psychological and psychosocial distress among youth in disaster-affected countries. A sample of 427 Sri Lankan Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim youth (mean age = 14.5) completed a survey with measures of exposure to disaster-related stressors and daily stressors, psychological distress (posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety), and psychosocial distress. The results indicated that daily stressors significantly mediated relations between war- and tsunami-related stressors and psychological and psychosocial distress. Some daily stressors not directly related to disaster also predicted functioning. These results point to the need for policies and interventions that focus on reducing proximal daily stressors that are salient to Sri Lankan youth exposed to disasters.",

We have measured the antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, flavan-3-ols monomers, and procyanidin levels in milk and dark chocolate, in cocoa powder, and in cocoa beans. Results show that for the cocoa products studied, antioxidant activity, and flavan-3-ol levels are stable over typical shelf lives of one year under controlled storage and over 2 years in ambient storage in the laboratory. We also show that 80 year old cocoa powder and 116 year old cocoa beans still show very high levels of antioxidant activity and flavan-3-ol content.",

        "Abstract": "Darfur refugees face hardships associated with chronic displacement, including lack of basic needs and safety concerns. Psychiatric research on refugees has focused on trauma, but daily stressors may contribute more to variance in distress. This article reports rates of past trauma and current stressors among Darfur refugees and gauges the contribution of each to psychological distress and functional impairment. A representative sample of 848 Darfuris in 2 refugee camps were interviewed about traumatic events, stressors faced in the camps, psychological distress, and functional impairment. Basic needs and safety concerns were more strongly correlated with measures of distress (rs = .19-.31) than were war-related traumatic events (rs = .09-.20). Hierarchical regression supported models in which effects of trauma on distress were mediated by current stressors. Although war-related traumatic events are the initial causes of refugees' hardship, findings suggest that the day-to-day challenges and concerns in camps mediate psychological distress associated with these events.",

        "Title": "Peripheral inhibition of glutaminase reduces carrageenan-induced Fos expression in the superficial dorsal horn of the rat.",
        "Abstract": "In inflamed tissue, the levels of the excitatory amino acid glutamate are increased. Glutamate sensitizes peripheral axons of primary afferent neurons during inflammation leading to decreased firing threshold and hyperexcitability. One proposed source of glutamate is the primary afferent. Antagonizing glutamate receptors on peripheral axons of primary afferents during inflammation provides analgesia in animals and humans. The enzyme glutaminase is used by primary sensory neurons to convert glutamine to glutamate, and peripheral inhibition of glutaminase with 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON) provides long-lasting analgesia during inflammation. In this study, we measured the effects of glutaminase inhibition on carrageenan-induced spinal Fos expression. Rats were given intraplantar injections of carrageenan and treated locally with either vehicle or DON. After 3h of inflammation, hind paw swelling and spinal expression of Fos were examined. CellProfiler was used to automate Fos nuclei counting in five laminar groupings in the spinal cord (I-II, III-IV, V-VI, VII-IX, X). Carrageenan increased hind paw thickness by approximately 70% and spinal Fos expression in superficial (I-II) and deep (V-VI) laminae by 10-fold and 5-fold, respectively. Treatment with DON reduced hind paw swelling by approximately 13% and suppressed Fos expression in the laminae I-II by approximately 54%, but not the deep laminae. Our results further support the notion of glutamate as a peripheral inflammatory mediator and indicate that glutaminase should be considered as a novel therapeutic target for treatment of inflammatory pain.",

        "Title": "Fixative composition alters distributions of immunoreactivity for glutaminase and two markers of nociceptive neurons, Nav1.8 and TRPV1, in the rat dorsal root ganglion.",
        "Abstract": "Most, if not all, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons use the neurotransmitter glutamate. There are, however, conflicting reports of the percentages of DRG neurons that express glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme that synthesizes glutamate, ranging from 30% to 100% of DRG neurons. Defining DRG neuron populations by the expression of proteins like GLS, which indicates function, is routinely accomplished with immunolabeling techniques. Proper characterization of DRG neuron populations relies on accurate detection of such antigens. It is known intuitively that fixation can alter immunoreactivity (IR). In this study, we compared the effects of five formaldehyde concentrations between 0.25% and 4.0% (w/v) and five picric acid concentrations between 0.0% and 0.8% (w/v) on the IR of GLS, the voltage-gated sodium channel 1.8 (Na(v)1.8), and the capsaicin receptor TRPV1. We also compared the effects of five incubation time lengths from 2 to 192 hr, in primary antiserum on IR. Lowering formaldehyde concentration elevated IR for all three antigens, while raising picric acid concentration increased Na(v)1.8 and TRPV1 IR. Increasing IR improved detection sensitivity, which led to higher percentages of labeled DRG neurons. By selecting fixation conditions that optimized IR, we found that all DRG neurons express GLS, 69% of neurons express Na(v)1.8, and 77% of neurons express TRPV1, indicating that some previous studies may have underestimated the percentages of DRG neurons expressing these proteins.

        "Abstract": "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare clonal stem cell disorder, which affects women of child-bearing age. PNH is associated with thrombotic complications, which are the main causes of morbidity and mortality. Management of a pregnant woman with PNH remains a challenge due to high incidence of thrombotic complications and the difficulty of differentiating a PNH crisis from the complications of pregnancy. PNH is associated with an increased rate of premature labor and fetal loss. Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the terminal complement protein C5, has revolutionized treatment of PNH. However, the role of eculizumab in pregnancy is unclear. We review the current strategies for the management of pregnant women with PNH, underline the controversies and present our recommendations.",

        "Abstract": "This paper seeks to bridge the divisive split between advocates of trauma-focused and psychosocial approaches to understanding and addressing mental health needs in conflict and post-conflict settings by emphasizing the role that daily stressors play in mediating direct war exposure and mental health outcomes. The authors argue that trauma-focused advocates tend to overemphasize the impact of direct war exposure on mental health, and fail to consider the contribution of stressful social and material conditions (daily stressors). Drawing on the findings of recent studies that have examined the relationship of both war exposure and daily stressors to mental health status, a model is proposed in which daily stressors partially mediate the relationship of war exposure to mental health. Based on that model, and on the growing body of research that supports it, an integrative, sequenced approach to intervention is proposed in which daily stressors are first addressed, and specialized interventions are then provided for individuals whose distress does not abate with the repair of the social ecology.",

        "Abstract": "Despite a key role for dense core vesicles (DCVs) in neuronal function, there are major gaps in our understanding of DCV biogenesis. A genetic screen for Caenorhabditis elegans mutants with behavioral defects consistent with impaired DCV function yielded five mutations in UNC-108 (Rab2). A genetic analysis showed that unc-108 mutations impair a DCV function unrelated to neuropeptide release that, together with neuropeptide release, fully accounts for the role of DCVs in locomotion. An electron microscopy analysis of DCVs in unc-108 mutants, coupled with quantitative imaging of DCV cargo proteins, revealed that Rab2 acts in cell somas during DCV maturation to prevent the loss of soluble and membrane cargo. In Rab2 null mutants, two thirds of these cargoes move to early endosomes via a PI(3)P-dependent trafficking pathway, whereas aggregated neuropeptides are unaffected. These results reveal how neurons solve a challenging trafficking problem using the most highly conserved animal Rab.",

        "Title": "Survey of commercially available chocolate- and cocoa-containing products in the United States. 2. Comparison of flavan-3-ol content with nonfat cocoa solids, total polyphenols, and percent cacao.",
        "Abstract": "A survey of a broad range of chocolate- and cocoa-containing products marketed in the United States was conducted to provide a more detailed analysis of flavan-3-ol monomers, oligomers, and polymers, which can be grouped into a class of compounds called procyanidins. Samples consisted of the three or four top-selling products within the following six categories: natural cocoa powder, unsweetened baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized for percent fat (% fat), percent nonfat cocoa solids (% NFCS), antioxidant level by ORAC, total polyphenols, epicatechin, catechin, total monomers, and flavan-3-ol oligomers and polymers (procyanidins). On a gram weight basis epicatechin and catechin content of the products follow in decreasing order: cocoa powder > baking chocolate > dark chocolate = baking chips > milk chocolate > chocolate syrup. Analysis of the monomer and oligomer profiles within product categories shows there are two types of profiles: (1) products that have high monomers with decreasing levels of oligomers and (2) products in which the level of dimers is equal to or greater than the monomers. Results show a strong correlation (R(2) = 0.834) of epicatechin to the level of % NFCS and also very good correlations for N = 2-5 oligomers to % NFCS. A weaker correlation was observed for catechin to % NFCS (R(2) = 0.680). Other analyses show a similar high degree of correlation with epicatechin and N = 2-5 oligomers to total polyphenols, with catechin being less well correlated to total polyphenols. A lesser but still good correlation exists between the calculated percent cacao (calcd % cacao) content, a proxy for percent cacao, and these same flavanol measures, with catechin again showing a lesser degree of correlation to calcd % cacao. Principal component analysis (PCA) shows that the products group discretely into five classes: (1) cocoa powder, (2) baking chocolate, (3) dark chocolate and semisweet chips, (4) milk chocolates, and (5) syrup. PCA also shows that most factors group closely together including the antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, and the flavan-3-ol measures with the exception of catechin and % fat in the product, which group separately. Because catechin distribution appears to be different from the other flavan-3-ol measures, an analysis of the epicatechin to catechin ratio was done, indicating there is a >5-fold variation in this measure across the products studied. The cocoa-containing products tested range from cocoa powder with 227.34 +/- 17.23 mg of procyanidins per serving to 25.75 +/- 9.91 mg of procyanidins per serving for chocolate syrup. These results are discussed with respect to other studies on commercial products, the bioavailability of the flavanols, and the possible role of processing on the amount of catechin in products.",

        "Abstract": "BCR-ABL plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and some cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Although ABL kinase inhibitors have shown great promise in the treatment of CML, the persistence of residual disease and the occurrence of resistance have prompted investigations into the molecular effectors of BCR-ABL. Here, we show that BCR-ABL stimulates the proteasome-dependent degradation of members of the forkhead family of tumor suppressors in vitro, in an in vivo animal model, and in samples from patients with BCR-ABL-positive CML or ALL. As several downstream mediators of BCR-ABL are regulated by the proteasome degradation pathway, we also show that inhibition of this pathway, using bortezomib, causes regression of CML-like disease. Bortezomib treatment led to inhibition of BCR-ABL-induced suppression of FoxO proteins and their proapoptotic targets, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and BIM, thereby providing novel insights into the molecular effects of proteasome inhibitor therapy. We additionally show sensitivity of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL T315I cells to bortezomib. Our data delineate the involvement of FoxO proteins in BCR-ABL-induced evasion of apoptosis and provide evidence that bortezomib is a candidate therapeutic in the treatment of BCR-ABL-induced leukemia.",

        "Abstract": "This phase 3 prospective randomized trial evaluated the efficacy and long-term safety of erythropoietin (EPO) with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus supportive care (SC; n = 53) versus SC alone (n = 57) for the treatment of anemic patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. The response rates in the EPO versus SC alone arms were 36% versus 9.6%, respectively, at the initial treatment step, 47% in the EPO arm, including subsequent steps. Responding patients had significantly lower serum EPO levels (45% vs 5% responses for levels < 200 mU/mL vs > or = 200 mU/mL) and improvement in multiple quality-of-life domains. With prolonged follow-up (median, 5.8 years), no differences were found in overall survival of patients in the EPO versus SC arms (median, 3.1 vs 2.6 years) or in the incidence of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (7.5% and 10.5% patients, respectively). Increased survival was demonstrated for erythroid responders versus nonresponders (median, 5.5 vs 2.3 years). Flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentage of P-glycoprotein(+) CD34(+) marrow blasts was positively correlated with longer overall survival. In comparison with SC alone, patients receiving EPO with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus SC had improved erythroid responses, similar survival, and incidence of acute myeloid leukemia transformation.",

Other types of psychiatric symptomatology, including depression and a culturally specific measure of general distress, correlated more highly with traumatic stress than did PTSD; and PTSD accounted for limited variance in functioning beyond that explained by depression and general distress.

        "Abstract": "In what regime does the cortical circuit operate? Our intracellular studies of surround suppression in cat primary visual cortex (V1) provide strong evidence on this question. Although suppression has been thought to arise from an increase in lateral inhibition, we find that the inhibition that cells receive is reduced, not increased, by a surround stimulus. Instead, suppression is mediated by a withdrawal of excitation. Thalamic recordings and previous work show that these effects cannot be explained by a withdrawal of thalamic input. We find in theoretical work that this behavior can only arise if V1 operates as an inhibition-stabilized network (ISN), in which excitatory recurrence alone is strong enough to destabilize visual responses but feedback inhibition maintains stability. We confirm two strong tests of this scenario experimentally and show through simulation that observed cell-to-cell variability in surround effects, from facilitation to suppression, can arise naturally from variability in the ISN.",

        "Title": "Equalization of ocular dominance columns induced by an activity-dependent learning rule and the maturation of inhibition.",
        "Abstract": "Early in development, the cat primary visual cortex (V1) is dominated by inputs driven by the contralateral eye. The pattern then reorganizes into ocular dominance columns that are roughly equally distributed between inputs serving the two eyes. This reorganization does not occur if the eyes are kept closed. The mechanism of this equalization is unknown. It has been argued that it is unlikely to involve Hebbian activity-dependent learning rules, on the assumption that these would favor an initially dominant eye. The reorganization occurs at the onset of the critical period (CP) for monocular deprivation (MD), the period when MD can cause a shift of cortical innervation in favor of the nondeprived eye. In mice, the CP is opened by the maturation of cortical inhibition, which does not occur if the eyes are kept closed. Here we show how these observations can be united: under Hebbian rules of activity-dependent synaptic modification, strengthening of intracortical inhibition can lead to equalization of the two eyes' inputs. Furthermore, when the effects of homeostatic synaptic plasticity or certain other mechanisms are incorporated, activity-dependent learning can also explain how MD causes a shift toward the open eye during the CP despite the drive by inhibition toward equalization of the two eyes' inputs. Thus, assuming similar mechanisms underlie the onset of the CP in cats as in mice, this and activity-dependent learning rules can explain the interocular equalization observed in cat V1 and its failure to occur without visual experience.",

        "Title": "Maximally reliable Markov chains under energy constraints.",
        "Abstract": "Signal-to-noise ratios in physical systems can be significantly degraded if the outputs of the systems are highly variable. Biological processes for which highly stereotyped signal generations are necessary features appear to have reduced their signal variabilities by employing multiple processing steps. To better understand why this multistep cascade structure might be desirable, we prove that the reliability of a signal generated by a multistate system with no memory (i.e., a Markov chain) is maximal if and only if the system topology is such that the process steps irreversibly through each state, with transition rates chosen such that an equal fraction of the total signal is generated in each state. Furthermore, our result indicates that by increasing the number of states, it is possible to arbitrarily increase the reliability of the system. In a physical system, however, an energy cost is associated with maintaining irreversible transitions, and this cost increases with the number of such transitions (i.e., the number of states). Thus, an infinite-length chain, which would be perfectly reliable, is infeasible. To model the effects of energy demands on the maximally reliable solution, we numerically optimize the topology under two distinct energy functions that penalize either irreversible transitions or incommunicability between states, respectively. In both cases, the solutions are essentially irreversible linear chains, but with upper bounds on the number of states set by the amount of available energy. We therefore conclude that a physical system for which signal reliability is important should employ a linear architecture, with the number of states (and thus the reliability) determined by the intrinsic energy constraints of the system.",

        "Title": "Balanced amplification: a new mechanism of selective amplification of neural activity patterns.",
        "Abstract": "In cerebral cortex, ongoing activity absent a stimulus can resemble stimulus-driven activity in size and structure. In particular, spontaneous activity in cat primary visual cortex (V1) has structure significantly correlated with evoked responses to oriented stimuli. This suggests that, from unstructured input, cortical circuits selectively amplify specific activity patterns. Current understanding of selective amplification involves elongation of a neural assembly's lifetime by mutual excitation among its neurons. We introduce a new mechanism for selective amplification without elongation of lifetime: \"balanced amplification.\" Strong balanced amplification arises when feedback inhibition stabilizes strong recurrent excitation, a pattern likely to be typical of cortex. Thus, balanced amplification should ubiquitously contribute to cortical activity. Balanced amplification depends on the fact that individual neurons project only excitatory or only inhibitory synapses. This leads to a hidden feedforward connectivity between activity patterns. We show in a detailed biophysical model that this can explain the cat V1 observations.",

        "Title": "Clinical implications of aging skin: cutaneous disorders in the elderly.",
        "Abstract": "Aging skin undergoes progressive degenerative change. Structural and physiologic changes that occur as a natural consequence of intrinsic aging combined with the effects of a lifetime of ongoing cumulative extrinsic damage and environment insult (e.g. overexposure to solar radiation) can produce a marked susceptibility to dermatologic disorders in the elderly. As skin ages, the vasculature progressively atrophies. The supporting dermis also deteriorates, with collagen and elastin fibers becoming sparse and increasingly disordered. These changes leave the elderly increasingly susceptible to both vascular disorders such as stasis dermatitis and skin injuries such as pressure ulcers and skin tears, with a steadily decreasing ability to effect skin repair. A parallel erosion of normal immune function produces higher levels of autoimmune skin disorders such as bullous pemphigoid, benign mucous membrane pemphigoid, paraneoplastic pemphigoid, and pemphigus vulgaris. Lichen sclerosus, an autoimmune disorder often occurring in the genital area in older women, is not common but is an important development because of the potential for substantial discomfort as well as serious complications. The prevalence of polypharmacy in this population increases the risk for autoimmune drug reactions, and diagnosis should be undertaken with an awareness that polypharmacy in this population creates a greatly increased susceptibility to drug eruptions that can mimic other cutaneous disorders. Immunologic senescence in the elderly also sets the stage for potential reactivation of the Varicella zoster virus, in which initial dermatologic involvement expands into the major sensory ganglia. Known as shingles, this disorder can be excruciatingly painful with the potential to cause blindness if the optic nerve becomes involved. Dermatoses such as xerosis, pruritus, and eczema are also widespread in the elderly, create substantial suffering in those afflicted, and often prove recalcitrant to treatment. Individual susceptibility to specific types of contact dermatitis changes over the lifetime, and seborrheic dermatitis is substantially more prevalent in the elderly. It is not uncommon for older patients to have multiple impairments, with the potential for cognitive dysfunction as well as impaired vision, hearing, or mobility. In addition, they may not have adequate housing or nutrition, or the financial resources necessary for adequate compliance. Physicians must take into consideration the patient's physical ability to comply with the recommended therapy as well as socioeconomic factors that may impact on compliance. Simple topical regimens are preferable wherever possible in order to maximize compliance and, therefore, efficacy. Extra effort may be necessary to ensure that instructions are accurately followed and that ongoing compliance with the regimen prescribed is actually achieved. Management of dermatologic disorders in the elderly is often less than optimal, due to the fact that the special needs and limitations of this population are not adequately considered. Treatments should consider the intrinsic differences between younger and older patients that may impact on diagnosis and therapy choice. The aged patient is often afflicted with numerous co-morbidities that can influence the choice of therapy. Skin integrity in the elderly is compromised, and safety concerns are increased with the long-term use of any medication prescribed. In addition, the prevalence of polypharmacy in the aged population substantially increases the risk of cutaneous drug reactions, which can profoundly complicate accurate diagnosis of dermatologic disorders. The aged population also needs to be more closely monitored because of increased fragility of the skin and the physical limitations that may hinder compliance with prescribed regimens.",

Compounds containing azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane and azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane rings fused to cyclopentenones were efficiently constructed via the PKR of cis-2,6-disubstituted N-acyl piperidine enyne substrates, many of which can be readily prepared from 4-methoxypyridine in a few steps. Moreover, the PKR of cis-2,6-disubstituted piperazine enynes allowed the preparation of diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes fused to cyclopentenones. This new strategy for the synthesis of azabridged bicyclic frameworks was exploited as a key step in a concise, enantioselective total synthesis of the macroline alklaoid (-)-alstonerine.",

        "Abstract": "The Diels-Alder reaction is one of the most well-studied, synthetically useful organic transformations. While a significant number of naturally occurring substances are postulated to arise by biosynthetic Diels-Alder reactions, rigorous confirmation of a mechanistically distinct natural Diels-Alderase enzyme remains elusive. Within this context, several related fungi within the Aspergillus genus produce a number of metabolites of opposite absolute configuration including (+)- or (-)-versicolamide B. These alkaloids are hypothesized to arise via biosynthetic Diels-Alder reactions implying that each Aspergillus species possesses enantiomerically distinct Diels-Alderases. Herein, experimental validation of these biosynthetic proposals via deployment of the IMDA reaction as a key step in the asymmetric total syntheses of (+)- and (-)-versicolamide B is described. Laboratory validation of the proposed biosynthetic Diels-Alder construction, coupled with the secondary metabolite profile of the producing fungi, reveals that each Aspergillus species has evolved enantiomerically distinct indole oxidases, as well as enantiomerically distinct Diels-Alderases.",

For women, daily stressors were a better predictor than war experiences of all mental health outcomes except for PTSD; for men, daily stressors were a better predictor of depression and functional impairment, while war experiences and daily stressors were similarly predictive of general distress. For men, daily stressors moderated the relationship between war experiences and PTSD, which was significant only under conditions of low daily stress. The study's implications for research and intervention in conflict and post-conflict settings are considered.",

        "Abstract": "This 4-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study (N=240), 1-year open label trial (N=233), and single-dose pharmacokinetic study (N=22) evaluated candesartan cilexetil (3 doses) in hypertensive children aged 6 to 17 years. Seventy-one percent were 12 years of age or older, 71% were male, and 47% were black. Systolic (SBP)/diastolic (DBP) blood pressure declined 8.6/4.8-11.2/8.0 mm Hg with candesartan and 3.7/1.8 mm Hg with placebo (P<.01 compared to placebo for SBP and for the mid and high doses for DBP; placebo-corrected 4.9/3.0-7.5/6.2 mm Hg). The slopes for dose were not, however, different from zero (P>.05). The response rate (SBP and DBP <95th percentile) after 1 year was 53%. The pharmacokinetic profiles in 6- to 12- and 12- to 17-year-olds were similar and were comparable to adults. Eight candesartan patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. Candesartan is an effective, well-tolerated antihypertensive agent for children aged 6 to 17 years and has a pharmacokinetic profile that is similar to that in adults.",

These sources differ in regard to collection methods, cellular content and transplant outcomes. In the related setting, use of peripheral blood stem cells, when compared to bone marrow, results in faster engraftment and may confer a survival benefit in advanced disease but also may lead to an increase in chronic graft-versus-host-disease. While cord blood stem cells are the simplest to collect and allow the greatest flexibility in HLA matching, they contain the lowest stem cell dose leading to the slowest engraftment. In this review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these different stem cell sources as well as areas for further research.",

Several decades ago, most people diagnosed with cancer did not live long beyond their initial diagnosis. Today the number of cancer survivors exceeds ten million, and this group may experience unique healthcare issues related to their cancer treatment. Chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy each have their own late and long-term complications. It is imperative for clinicians who are caring for cancer survivors to be aware of long-term complications of therapy and to treat these appropriately. When cancer therapy has successfully added years of life, it is equally as important that medical care assures the best quality of life during those years.",

        "Title": "Seasons of survivorship revisited.",
        "Abstract": "Several decades ago the chance of a cancer survivor enjoying long-term survival was limited. At that time the terms cancer survivor and cancer survivorship were new. A cancer survivor was defined as a person from the moment of diagnosis onward for as long as they live. Cancer survivorship was also described in several \"seasons\" including; acute survivorship (the experience of diagnosis and treatment), extended survivorship (a time for \"watchful waiting\"), and then permanent survivorship (long-term remission). Today, acute cancer survivorship is still a time of intense emotion and medical activity surrounding the diagnosis, staging, and actual treatment. We then propose that after the intense initial therapy is completed the survivors enter a \"season\" that can be called \"transitional cancer survivorship\" reflecting the transition from active treatment to careful observation and the emotional, social, and medical adaptations that occur. Next, there are a growing number of cancer survivors who are (1) alive and \"living with cancer\" but requiring ongoing treatment for recurrent, active, and often advanced disease; (2) in a complete remission that requires ongoing therapy; or (3) in a complete remission and with a favorable prognosis. Collectively, this is a diverse group in \"extended survivorship\" and some later go on to obtain a permanent remission although others experience disease progression. Finally, there are millions of long-term or \"permanent survivors.\" This group is also very heterogeneous and is comprised of 4 subgroups including (1) survivors who are \"cancer-free but not free of cancer,\" (2) survivors who are cancer-free but continue to have significant \"fall-out\" from cancer and its treatment including psychosocial, medical, financial, or legal sequelae, (3) survivors who go on to develop second cancers which may be unrelated to the first cancer or its treatment, or may be more likely due to genetic or environmental factors, and also (4) survivors who later develop cancers that are secondary to the initial treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is predominantly expressed in liver and regulates cholesterol metabolism by down regulating liver LDL receptor (LDLR) proteins. Here we report transgenic overexpression of human PCSK9 in kidney increased plasma levels of PCSK9 and subsequently led to a dramatic reduction in liver LDLR proteins. The regulation of LDLR by PCSK9 displayed tissue specificity, with liver being the most responsive tissue. Even though the PCSK9 transgene was highly expressed in kidney, LDLR proteins were suppressed to a lower extent in this tissue than in liver. Adrenal LDLR proteins were not regulated by elevated plasma PCSK9. hPCSK9 transgene expression and subsequent reduction of liver LDLR led to increases in plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and ApoB, which were further increased by a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet. We also observed that the size distribution of hPCSK9 in transgenic mouse plasma was heterogeneous. In chow-fed mice, the majority of PCSK9 proteins were in free forms; however, feeding a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet resulted in a shift of hPCSK9 distribution toward larger complexes. PCSK9 distribution in human plasma also exhibited heterogeneity and individual variability in the percentage of PCSK9 in free form and in large complexes. We provide strong evidence to support that human PCSK9 proteins secreted from extrahepatic tissue are able to promote LDLR degradation in liver and increase plasma LDL. Our data also suggest that LDLR protein regulation by PCSK9 has tissue specificity, with liver being the most responsive tissue.",

        "Abstract": "Dietary resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene) has been implicated in the health benefits associated with grapes and red wine, more specifically with potential benefits for metabolic syndrome, energy use, and increased endurance. Levels of trans-resveratrol and its glucoside, trans-piceid, were determined in 19 top selling commercially available cocoa-containing and chocolate products from the U.S. market. Amounts of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid were closely correlated with the amount of nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) in the cocoa-containing products. Among these products, trans-resveratrol levels were highest in cocoa powders (1.85 +/- 0.43 microg/g), followed by unsweetened baking chocolates (1.24 +/- 0.22), semisweet chocolate baking chips (0.52 +/- 0.14), dark chocolates (0.35 +/- 0.08), milk chocolates (0.10 +/- 0.05), and chocolate syrups (0.09 +/- 0.02). These cocoa-containing and chocolate products have about 3-5 times more trans-piceid than trans-resveratrol. Levels of trans-piceid were highest in the cocoa powders (7.14 +/- 0.80 microg/g), followed by unsweetened baking chocolates (4.04 +/- 0.14), semisweet chocolate baking chips (2.01 +/- 0.18), dark chocolates (1.82 +/- 0.36), milk chocolates (0.44 +/- 0.06), and chocolate syrups (0.35 +/- 0.06). On an equal weight basis, cocoa powder had about half as much trans-resveratrol as the average California red wine. On a per serving basis, cocoa-containing and chocolate products had less trans-resveratrol than red wine and grape juice but more than roasted peanuts. Overall, these cocoa-containing and chocolate products rank second after red wines and grape juice in foods with the highest levels of total trans-resveratrol in the diet.",

        "Title": "Impact of alkalization on the antioxidant and flavanol content of commercial cocoa powders.",
        "Abstract": "Cocoa is a food ingredient that is important for the contribution of flavor to foods but is also associated with potential health benefits. The chemistry thought to be responsible for its cardiovascular health benefits is the flavanol (flavan-3-ol) antioxidants. Evidence from the literature indicates that natural cocoas are high in flavanols, but when the cocoa is processed with alkali, also known as Dutch processing or Dutching, the flavanols are substantially reduced. This paper provides a survey of the physical and chemical composition of representative natural cocoas and lightly, medium, and heavily alkalized cocoas. As part of the survey, both brown/black and red/brown alkali-processed cocoas were measured. Natural cocoa powders have an extractable pH of 5.3-5.8. Alkalized cocoa powders were grouped into lightly treated (pH 6.50-7.20), medium-treated (pH 7.21-7.60), and heavily treated (pH 7.61 and higher). The natural, nonalkalized powders had the highest ORAC and total polyphenols and flavanols (including procyanidins). These chemical measurements showed a linear decrease as the extractable pH of the cocoa powder increased. Likewise, the flavanol monomers, oligomers, and polymers all showed a linear decrease with increasing pH of the final cocoa powder. When brown/black cocoa powders were compared to red cocoa powders, similar decreases in flavanols were observed with increased alkalization. The average total flavanol contents were 34.6 +/- 6.8 mg/g for the natural cocoas, 13.8 +/- 7.3 mg/g for the lightly processed cocoas, 7.8 +/- 4.0 mg/g for the medium processed cocoas, and 3.9 +/- 1.8 mg/g for the heavily processed cocoa powders. The observed linear and predictable impact of alkalization on flavanol content is discussed with respect to other reports in the literature as well as what implications it may have on diet and food manufacturing.",

        "Title": "A novel molecular solution for ultraviolet light detection in Caenorhabditis elegans.",
        "Abstract": "For many organisms the ability to transduce light into cellular signals is crucial for survival. Light stimulates DNA repair and metabolism changes in bacteria, avoidance responses in single-cell organisms, attraction responses in plants, and both visual and nonvisual perception in animals. Despite these widely differing responses, in all of nature there are only six known families of proteins that can transduce light. Although the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans has none of the known light transduction systems, we show here that C. elegans strongly accelerates its locomotion in response to blue or shorter wavelengths of light, with maximal responsiveness to ultraviolet light. Our data suggest that C. elegans uses this light response to escape the lethal doses of sunlight that permeate its habitat. Short-wavelength light drives locomotion by bypassing two critical signals, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and diacylglycerol (DAG), that neurons use to shape and control behaviors. C. elegans mutants lacking these signals are paralyzed and unresponsive to harsh physical stimuli in ambient light, but short-wavelength light rapidly rescues their paralysis and restores normal levels of coordinated locomotion. This light response is mediated by LITE-1, a novel ultraviolet light receptor that acts in neurons and is a member of the invertebrate Gustatory receptor (Gr) family. Heterologous expression of the receptor in muscle cells is sufficient to confer light responsiveness on cells that are normally unresponsive to light. Our results reveal a novel molecular solution for ultraviolet light detection and an unusual sensory modality in C. elegans that is unlike any previously described light response in any organism.",

        "Abstract": "As life expectancy in the U.S. increases - and with it the proportion of the aged in the population - appropriate care of elderly skin becomes a medical concern of increasing importance. As skin ages, the intrinsic structural changes that are a natural consequence of passing time are inevitably followed by subsequent physiological changes that affect the skin's ability to function as the interface between internal and external environments. The pH of the skin surface increases with age, increasing its susceptibility to infection. Neurosensory perception of superficial pain is diminished both in intensity and speed of perception (increasing the risk of thermal injury); deep tissue pain, however, may be enhanced. A decline in lipid content as the skin ages inhibits the permeability of nonlipophilic compounds, reducing the efficacy of some topical medications. Allergic and irritant reactions are blunted, as is the inflammatory response, compromising the ability of the aged skin to affect wound repair. These functional impairments (although a predictable consequence of intrinsic structural changes) have the potential to cause significant morbidity in the elderly patient and may, as well, be greatly exacerbated by extrinsic factors like photodamage. As numbers of the elderly increase, medical as well as cosmetic dermatological interventions will be necessary to optimize the quality of life for this segment of the population.",

Patients often self-treat with over-the-counter antifungals or home remedies, although they are unable to distinguish among the possible causes of their symptoms. Telephone triage practices and time constraints on office visits may also hamper effective diagnosis. This review is a guide to distinguish potential causes of vulvovaginal symptoms. The first section describes both common and uncommon conditions associated with vulvovaginitis, including infectious vulvovaginitis, allergic contact dermatitis, systemic dermatoses, rare autoimmune diseases, and neuropathic vulvar pain syndromes. The focus is on the clinical presentation, specifically 1) the absence or presence and characteristics of vaginal discharge; 2) the nature of sensory symptoms (itch and/or pain, localized or generalized, provoked, intermittent, or chronic); and 3) the absence or presence of mucocutaneous changes, including the types of lesions observed and the affected tissue. Additionally, this review describes how such features of the clinical presentation can help identify various causes of vulvovaginitis.",

        "Abstract": "Where we allocate our visual spatial attention depends upon a continual competition between internally generated goals and external distractions. Recently it was shown that single neurons in the macaque lateral intraparietal area (LIP) can predict the amount of time a distractor can shift the locus of spatial attention away from a goal. We propose that this remarkable dynamical correspondence between single neurons and attention can be explained by a network model in which generically high-dimensional firing-rate vectors rapidly decay to a single mode. We find direct experimental evidence for this model, not only in the original attentional task, but also in a very different task involving perceptual decision making. These results confirm a theoretical prediction that slowly varying activity patterns are proportional to spontaneous activity, pose constraints on models of persistent activity, and suggest a network mechanism for the emergence of robust behavioral timing from heterogeneous neuronal populations.",

        "Abstract": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has established several methods to delineate wellhead protection areas (WHPAs) around community wells in order to protect them from surface contamination sources. Delineating a WHPA often requires defining the capture zone for a well. Generally, analytical models or arbitrary setback zones have been used to define the capture zone in areas where little is known about the distribution of hydraulic head, hydraulic conductivity, or recharge. Numerical modeling, however, even in areas of sparse data, offers distinct advantages over the more simplified analytical models or arbitrary setback zones. The systematic approach discussed here calibrates a numerical flow model to regional topography and then applies a matrix of plausible recharge to hydraulic conductivity ratios (R/K) to investigate the impact on the size and shape of the capture zone. This approach does not attempt to determine the uncertainty of the model but instead yields several possible capture zones, the composite of which is likely to contain the actual capture zone. A WHPA based on this composite capture zone will protect ground water resources better than one based on any individual capture zone. An application of the method to three communities illustrates development of the R/K matrix and demonstrates that the method is particularly well suited for determining capture zones in alluvial aquifers.",

        "Title": "On the importance of static nonlinearity in estimating spatiotemporal neural filters with natural stimuli.",
        "Abstract": "Understanding neural responses with natural stimuli has increasingly become an essential part of characterizing neural coding. Neural responses are commonly characterized by a linear-nonlinear (LN) model, in which the output of a linear filter applied to the stimulus is transformed by a static nonlinearity to determine neural response. To estimate the linear filter in the LN model, studies of responses to natural stimuli commonly use methods that are unbiased only for a linear model (in which there is no static nonlinearity): spike-triggered averages with correction for stimulus power spectrum, with or without regularization. Although these methods work well for artificial stimuli, such as Gaussian white noise, we show here that they estimate neural filters of LN models from responses to natural stimuli much more poorly. We studied simple cells in cat primary visual cortex. We demonstrate that the filters computed by directly taking the nonlinearity into account have better predictive power and depend less on the stimulus than those computed under the linear model. With noise stimuli, filters computed using the linear and LN models were similar, as predicted theoretically. With natural stimuli, filters of the two models can differ profoundly. Noise and natural stimulus filters differed significantly in spatial properties, but these differences were exaggerated when filters were computed using the linear rather than the LN model. Although regularization of filters computed under the linear model improved their predictive power, it also led to systematic distortions of their spatial frequency profiles, especially at low spatial and temporal frequencies.",

The synthesis of the two monochloro species enabled the structure of malbrancheamide B to be unambiguously assigned. The syntheses each feature an intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction of a 5-hydroxypyrazin-2(1H)-one to construct the bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane core, which has also been proposed as the biosynthetic route to these compounds.",

        "Abstract": "We identify here a novel class of loss-of-function alleles of uncoordinated locomotion(unc)-108, which encodes the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of the mammalian small guanosine triphosphatase Rab2. Like the previously isolated dominant-negative mutants, unc-108 loss-of-function mutant animals are defective in locomotion. In addition, they display unique defects in the removal of apoptotic cells, revealing a previously uncharacterized function for Rab2. unc-108 acts in neurons and engulfing cells to control locomotion and cell corpse removal, respectively, indicating that unc-108 has distinct functions in different cell types. Using time-lapse microscopy, we find that unc-108 promotes the degradation of engulfed cell corpses. It is required for the efficient recruitment and fusion of lysosomes to phagosomes and the acidification of the phagosomal lumen. In engulfing cells, UNC-108 is enriched on the surface of phagosomes. We propose that UNC-108 acts on phagosomal surfaces to promote phagosome maturation and suggest that mammalian Rab2 may have a similar function in the degradation of apoptotic cells.",

        "Abstract": "The effectiveness of low-dose omeprazole as primary prevention of gastrointestinal adverse events due to episodic use of non-selective NSAIDs was evaluated. Healthy adults aged 50-75 who did not take chronic NSAIDs were randomized to a 6.5-day treatment of naproxen 500 mg twice daily plus omeprazole 20 mg daily or naproxen 500 mg twice daily plus placebo. Seventy subjects were enrolled (mean age 58.6 years, proportion >60 = 41.4%). Subjects receiving naproxen plus omeprazole developed fewer gastroduodenal ulcers compared to subjects receiving naproxen plus placebo (11.8% vs. 46.9%, P = 0.002). Likewise, naproxen plus omeprazole was associated with a decreased risk of ulceration and/or >5 erosions (38.2% vs. 81.3%, P < or = 0.001), and a smaller change in dyspepsia score. Considering their relatively low cost, ready availability, and favorable safety profile, low-dose PPI co-prescription in healthy adults requiring short-term therapy with non-selective NSAIDs may be reasonable.",

Skin aging is a complex, multifactorial process whose baseline rate is genetically determined but that may be accelerated by environmental, mechanical, or socioeconomic factors. The intrinsic structural changes that occur with the aging of the skin increase skin fragility, decrease the ability of the skin to heal, increase risk for toxicological injuries, promote the development of various cutaneous disorders, and produce aesthetically undesirable effects like wrinkling and uneven pigmentation. As aged patients represent a larger segment of the population, increased attention to the problems of the aged skin, both cosmetic and beyond, will be necessary and should build on currently successful interventions to improve their quality of life.",

Most adults past the age of 65 suffer incontinence on some level, with significant and often devastating impact on the physical and emotional health of the patient. Incontinence in the older adult is a humiliating and disabling disorder, which causes substantial stress, depression, and limitation. It can impede interpersonal relationships, decrease sexual function, and increase the risk of debilitating falls, institutionalization, and even increase mortality. Incontinence also represents a substantial economic burden to the general population. Nonetheless, incontinence is often undiagnosed, and when diagnosed, often left untreated. Although common in older adults, incontinence is not an inevitable consequence of aging but a disorder that can and should be treated. Appropriate clinical management of incontinence can help seniors continue to lead vital, active lives as well as avoid the cutaneous sequelae of this disorder.",

        "Abstract": "A novel regio- and stereoselective [Rh(CO)2Cl]2-catalyzed allylic alkylation of unsymmetrical allylic carbonates was discovered. The regioselectivity of the reaction favors product ratios in which substitution occurs at the carbon bearing the leaving group. When an enantiomerically enriched carbonate (> or = 99% ee) was examined, the Rh(I)-catalyzed allylic alkylation proceeded stereoselectively to provide the alkylation product with retention of absolute stereochemistry (98% ee). To establish the scope of the [Rh(CO)2Cl]2-catalyzed allylic alkylation, a variety of carbon and heteroatom nucleophiles were examined and the results described. As an application of the Rh(I)-catalyzed allylic alkylation, a series of novel domino reactions have been developed that couple the unique regio- and stereoselective [Rh(CO)2Cl]2-catalyzed alkylation of allylic trifluoroacetates with an intramolecular Pauson-Khand annulation, a cycloisomerization, or a [5+2] cycloaddition. A unique aspect of the method described is the use of a single catalyst to effect sequential transformations in which the catalytic activity is moderated simply by controlling the reaction temperature. Implementation of such processes provides a rapid and efficient entry to a variety of bicyclic carbon skeletons from simple precursors.",

        "Abstract": "The Galpha(q) pathway is essential for animal life and is a central pathway for driving locomotion, egg laying, and growth in Caenorhabditis elegans, where it exerts its effects through EGL-8 (phospholipase Cbeta [PLCbeta]) and at least one other effector. To find the missing effector, we performed forward genetic screens to suppress the slow growth and hyperactive behaviors of mutants with an overactive Galpha(q) pathway. Four suppressor mutations disrupted the Rho-specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain of UNC-73 (Trio). The mutations produce defects in neuronal function, but not neuronal development, that cause sluggish locomotion similar to animals lacking EGL-8 (PLCbeta). Strains containing null mutations in both EGL-8 (PLCbeta) and UNC-73 (Trio RhoGEF) have strong synthetic phenotypes that phenocopy the arrested growth and near-complete paralysis of Galpha(q)-null mutants. Using cell-based and biochemical assays, we show that activated C. elegans Galpha(q) synergizes with Trio RhoGEF to activate RhoA. Activated Galpha(q) and Trio RhoGEF appear to be part of a signaling complex, because they coimmunoprecipitate when expressed together in cells. Our results show that Trio's Rho-specific GEF domain is a major Galpha(q) effector that, together with PLCbeta, mediates the Galpha(q) signaling that drives the locomotion, egg laying, and growth of the animal.",

        "Abstract": "Urinary and faecal incontinence affects a significant portion of the elderly population. The increase in the incidence of incontinence is not only dependent on age but also on the onset of concomitant ageing issues such as infection, polypharmacy, and decreased cognitive function. If incontinence is left untreated, a host of dermatological complications can occur, including incontinence dermatitis, dermatological infections, intertrigo, vulvar folliculitis, and pruritus ani. The presence of chronic incontinence can produce a vicious cycle of skin damage and inflammation because of the loss of cutaneous integrity. Minimizing skin damage caused by incontinence is dependent on successful control of excess hydration, maintenance of proper pH, minimization of interaction between urine and faeces, and prevention of secondary infection. Even though incontinence is common in the aged, it is not an inevitable consequence of ageing but a disorder that can and should be treated. Appropriate clinical management of incontinence can help seniors continue to lead vital active lives as well as avoid the cutaneous sequelae of incontinence.",

        "Title": "Effects of inhibitory gain and conductance fluctuations in a simple model for contrast-invariant orientation tuning in cat V1.",
        "Abstract": "The origin of orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex (V1) is a model problem for understanding cerebral cortical circuitry. A key constraint is that orientation tuning width is invariant under changes in stimulus contrast. We have previously shown that this can arise from the combination of feedforward lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) input and an orientation-untuned component of feedforward inhibition that dominates excitation. However, these models did not include the large background voltage noise observed in vivo. Here, we include this noise and examine a simple model of cat V1 response. Constraining our simulations to fit physiological data, our single model parameter is the strength of feedforward inhibition relative to LGN excitation. With physiological noise, the contrast invariance of orientation tuning depends little on inhibition level, although very weak or very strong inhibition leads to weak broadening or sharpening, respectively, of tuning with contrast. For any inhibition level, an alternative measure of orientation tuning -- the circular variance -- decreases with contrast as observed experimentally. These results arise primarily because the voltage noise causes large inputs to be much more strongly amplified than small ones in evoking spiking responses, relatively suppressing responses to nonpreferred stimuli. However, inhibition comparable to or stronger than excitation appears necessary to suppress spiking responses to nonpreferred orientations to the extent seen in vivo and to allow the emergence of a tuned mean voltage response. These two response properties provide the strongest constraints on model details. Antiphase inhibition from inhibitory simple cells, and not just untuned inhibition from inhibitory complex cells, appears necessary to fully explain these aspects of cortical orientation tuning.",

        "Abstract": "Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons connect the spinal cord and uterine cervix, and are activated at parturition with subsequent stimulation of secondary neurons in the spinal dorsal horn and autonomic areas. Neuropeptide neurotransmitters and receptors have been studied in these areas, but amino acid transmitters, e.g., glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter involved in sensory and nociceptive processing, have not been characterized. To determine if glutamate is involved in innervation of the cervix, rats were examined for markers of glutamatergic neurons in the L6-S1 spinal cord, DRG and cervix. Metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR5 in the spinal dorsal horn and their expression over pregnancy were examined in pregnant rats and pregnant rats treated continuously with an antagonist of mGluR5, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine (MPEP). Rats were allowed to deliver pups to determine if the antagonist altered the expression of an early response gene protein, Fos, in the L6-S1 cord. Immunohistochemistry showed glutamate- and vesicular glutamate transporter1 (VGluT1)-positive fibers in the cervix, glutamate- and VGluT1-expressing neurons in the DRG, some of which also exhibited retrograde tracer from cervical injections, and VGluT1 and mGluR5 immunoreactivities in the L6-S1 spinal dorsal horns. Expression of mGluR5 receptors increased over pregnancy. Fos-positive neurons were present among mGluR5-immunoreactivity in the spinal dorsal horn. Parturition-induced Fos-positive neurons in the spinal cords were abundant in control rats, but were reduced by 70% in MPEP-treated animals. These results suggest that glutamate is likely involved in the transmission of sensory signals, possibly pain, from the cervix to the spinal cord at parturition.",

        "Abstract": "Recent world events have increased concern that hospitals must be prepared for radiological emergencies. Emergency departments (EDs) must be ready to treat patients suffering from injuries in combination with radiation exposure or contamination with radioactive material. Every hospital should have a Radiological Emergency Medical Response Plan, tested through periodic drills, which will allow effective handling of contaminated and injured patients. Treatment of life-threatening or severe traumatic injuries must take priority over radiation-related issues. The risk to ED staff from radioactive contamination is minimal if universal precautions are used. The likelihood of significant radiation exposure to staff under most circumstances is small. Educating medical staff on the magnitude of the radiological hazards allows them to promptly and confidently provide the necessary patient care. Measures must be taken to prevent the \"worried well\" and uninjured people with radioactive contamination from overwhelming the ED.",

A mixed-method design was used in Kabul, Afghanistan, to identify local indicators of distress and develop the 22-item Afghan Symptom Checklist (ASCL). The ASCL contains several indigenous items and items familiar to Western mental health professionals. The ASCL was pilot tested and subsequently administered to 324 adults in 8 districts of Kabul. It demonstrated excellent reliability (alpha=.93) and good construct validity, correlating strongly with a measure of exposure to war-related violence and loss (r=.70). Results of the survey indicate moderate levels of distress among Afghan men and markedly higher levels of distress and impaired functioning among women (and widows in particular).",

The authors question the utility of the dominant focus on posttraumatic stress disorder and other disorders of Western psychiatry, and they identify a set of critical research foci related to mental health work with communities affected by political violence. Core assumptions of TFPE and its roots in logical positivism and the biomedical model of contemporary psychiatry are explored. The authors suggest that an alternative framework--social constructivism--can serve as a bridge between researchers and practitioners by helping to refocus research efforts in ways that are conceptually and methodologically more attuned to the needs of war-affected communities and those working to address their mental health needs.",

        "Title": "Responses of thoracic spinal neurons to activation and desensitization of cardiac TRPV1-containing afferents in rats.",
        "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine how upper thoracic spinal neurons responded to activation and desensitization of cardiac transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1)-containing afferent fibers. Extracellular potentials of single T3 spinal neurons were recorded in pentobarbital-anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated male rats. To activate cardiac nociceptive receptors, a catheter was placed in the pericardial sac to administer various chemicals: bradykinin (BK; 10 microg/ml, 0.2 ml), capsaicin (CAP, 10 microg/ml, 0.2 ml), or a mixture of algesic chemicals (AC; 0.2 ml) containing adenosine 10(-3) M, BK, serotonin, histamine, and PGE(2), 10(-5) M for each. Spinal neurons that responded to intrapericardial BK and/or CAP were used in this study. Results showed that 81% (35/43) of the neurons had excitatory responses to both intrapericardial BK and CAP, and the remainder responded to either BK or CAP. Intrapericardial resiniferatoxin (RTX) (0.2 microg/ml, 0.2 ml, 1 min), which desensitizes TRPV1-containing nerve endings, abolished excitatory responses to both BK (n = 8) and CAP (n = 7), and to AC (n = 5) but not to somatic stimuli. Intrapericardial capsazepine (1 mg/ml, 0.2 ml, 3 min), a specific antagonist of TRPV1, sharply attenuated excitatory responses to CAP in 5/5 neurons, but responses to BK in 5/5 neurons was maintained. Additionally, intrapericardial capsazepine had no significant effect on excitatory responses to AC in 3/3 neurons. These data indicated that intrapericardial BK-initiated spinal neuronal responses were linked to cardiac TRPV1-containing afferent fibers, but were not dependent on TRPV1. Intraspinal signaling for cardiac nociception was mediated through CAP-sensitive afferent fibers innervating the heart.",

        "Abstract": "Synaptic vesicles undergo a maturation step, termed priming, in which they become competent to fuse with the plasma membrane. To morphologically define the site of vesicle priming and identify fusion-competent synaptic vesicles, we combined a rapid physical-fixation technique with immunogold staining and high-resolution morphometric analysis at Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junctions. In these presynaptic terminals, a subset of synaptic vesicles contact the plasma membrane within approximately 100 nm of a presynaptic dense projection. UNC-13, a protein required for vesicle priming, localizes to this same region of the plasma membrane. In an unc-13 null mutant, few synaptic vesicles contact the plasma membrane, suggesting that membrane-contacting synaptic vesicles represent the morphological correlates of primed vesicles. Interestingly, a subpopulation of membrane-contacting vesicles, located within 30 nm of a dense projection, are unperturbed in unc-13 mutants. We show that UNC-10/Rim, a protein implicated in presynaptic plasticity, localizes to dense projections and that loss of UNC-10/Rim causes an UNC-13-independent reduction in membrane-contacting synaptic vesicles within 30 nm of the dense projections. Our data together identify a discrete domain for vesicle priming within 100 nm of dense projections and further suggest that UNC-10/Rim and UNC-13 separately contribute to the membrane localization of synaptic vesicles within this domain.",

        "Abstract": "Between 2002 and 2012, the number of individuals > 55 years of age in the workforce is projected to climb by approximately 50%. Few studies have substantiated that severe occupational injury to older workers is a significant problem. To identify the variables related to traumatic injuries of older workers, data were abstracted retrospectively from a regional trauma center database, including demographic and injury characteristics, length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and cost. The results showed that older workers had higher fatality rates than younger workers. As age increased, the Injury Severity Score also increased. Most injuries were the result of falls, with orthopedic injuries being the most common type of injury. Patients spent an average of 6 days in the ICU at a cost of > 4920 US dollars/day. By identifying the characteristics associated with older workers' severe occupational injuries, further research and better industry programs targeting this group can be implemented.",

        "Abstract": "In the United States, commercially available foods, including cocoa and chocolate, are being marketed with statements referring to the level of antioxidant activity and polyphenols. For cocoa-containing foods, there has been no comprehensive survey of the content of these and other chemistries. A survey of cocoa and chocolate-containing products marketed in the United States was conducted to determine antioxidant activity and polyphenol and procyanidin contents. Commercially available samples consisted of the top market share products in each of the following six categories: natural cocoa, unsweetened baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized using four different methods: oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), vitamin C equivalence antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), total polyphenols, and procyanidins. All composite lots were further characterized for percent nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) and percent fat. Natural cocoas had the highest levels of antioxidant activities, total polyphenols, and procyanidins followed by baking chocolates, dark chocolates and baking chips, and finally milk chocolate and syrups. The results showed a strong linear correlation between NFCS and ORAC (R (2) = 0.9849), total polyphenols (R (2) = 0.9793), and procyanidins (R (2) = 0.946), respectively. On the basis of principal component analysis, 81.4% of the sample set was associated with NFCS, antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, and procyanidins. The results indicated that, regardless of the product category, NFCS were the primary factor contributing to the level of cocoa antioxidants in the products tested. Results further suggested that differences in cocoa bean blends and processing, with the possible exception of Dutching, are minor factors in determining the level of antioxidants in commercially available cocoa-containing products in the United States.",

        "Abstract": "Forward genetic screens for mutations that rescue the paralysis of ric-8 (Synembryn) reduction-of-function mutations frequently reveal mutations that cause hyperactivation of one or more components of the G alpha(s) pathway. Here, we report that one of these mutations strongly reduces the function of the Dunce cAMP phosphodiesterase PDE-4 by disrupting a conserved active site residue. Loss of function and neural overexpression of PDE-4 have profound and opposite effects on locomotion rate, but drug-response assays suggest that loss of PDE-4 function does not affect steady-state acetylcholine release or reception. Our genetic analysis suggests that PDE-4 regulates both G alpha(s)-dependent and G alpha(s)-independent cAMP pools in the neurons controlling locomotion rate. By immunostaining, PDE-4 is strongly expressed throughout the nervous system, where it localizes to small regions at the outside boundaries of synaptic vesicle clusters as well as intersynaptic regions. The synaptic subregions containing PDE-4 are distinct from those containing active zones, as indicated by costaining with an antibody against the long form of UNC-13. This highly focal subsynaptic localization suggests that PDE-4 may exert its effects by spatially regulating intrasynaptic cAMP pools.",

        "Abstract": "Sensory neuroscience seeks to understand how the brain encodes natural environments. However, neural coding has largely been studied using simplified stimuli. In order to assess whether the brain's coding strategy depends on the stimulus ensemble, we apply a new information-theoretic method that allows unbiased calculation of neural filters (receptive fields) from responses to natural scenes or other complex signals with strong multipoint correlations. In the cat primary visual cortex we compare responses to natural inputs with those to noise inputs matched for luminance and contrast. We find that neural filters adaptively change with the input ensemble so as to increase the information carried by the neural response about the filtered stimulus. Adaptation affects the spatial frequency composition of the filter, enhancing sensitivity to under-represented frequencies in agreement with optimal encoding arguments. Adaptation occurs over 40 s to many minutes, longer than most previously reported forms of adaptation.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a patient with acquired alpha-thalassemia myelodysplastic syndrome (ATMDS). A previously healthy 66-year-old man presented with hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume 59 fL, and a bone marrow aspirate with increased erythroid precursors and hypolobulated megakaryocytes. Hemoglobin H inclusions were seen in most red cells after 1% brilliant cresyl blue supravital stain of the peripheral blood. At the molecular level, we identified of a novel mutation in the most 3' exon of the ATRX gene (CGA-->TGA substitution in codon 2407) resulting in a premature termination codon (p.R2407X). This case provides further evidence for a link between ATRX mutations and ATMDS, and suggests a possible role for the conserved Q-box element in ATRX function.",

        "Abstract": "We review Phanerozoic sea-level changes [543 million years ago (Ma) to the present] on various time scales and present a new sea-level record for the past 100 million years (My). Long-term sea level peaked at 100 +/- 50 meters during the Cretaceous, implying that ocean-crust production rates were much lower than previously inferred. Sea level mirrors oxygen isotope variations, reflecting ice-volume change on the 10(4)- to 10(6)-year scale, but a link between oxygen isotope and sea level on the 10(7)-year scale must be due to temperature changes that we attribute to tectonically controlled carbon dioxide variations. Sea-level change has influenced phytoplankton evolution, ocean chemistry, and the loci of carbonate, organic carbon, and siliciclastic sediment burial. Over the past 100 My, sea-level changes reflect global climate evolution from a time of ephemeral Antarctic ice sheets (100 to 33 Ma), through a time of large ice sheets primarily in Antarctica (33 to 2.5 Ma), to a world with large Antarctic and large, variable Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (2.5 Ma to the present).",

        "Abstract": "C. elegans mutants lacking the dense-core vesicle priming protein UNC-31 (CAPS) share highly similar phenotypes with mutants lacking a neuronal G alpha(s) pathway, including strong paralysis despite exhibiting near normal levels of steady-state acetylcholine release as indicated by drug sensitivity assays. Our genetic analysis shows that UNC-31 and neuronal G alpha(s) are different parts of the same pathway and that the UNC-31/G alpha(s) pathway is functionally distinct from the presynaptic G alpha(q) pathway with which it interacts. UNC-31 acts upstream of G alpha(s) because mutations that activate the G alpha(s) pathway confer similar levels of strongly hyperactive, coordinated locomotion in both unc-31 null and (+) backgrounds. Using cell-specific promoters, we show that both UNC-31 and the G alpha(s) pathway function in cholinergic motor neurons to regulate locomotion rate. Using immunostaining we show that UNC-31 is often concentrated at or near active zones of cholinergic motor neuron synapses. Our data suggest that presynaptic UNC-31 activity, likely acting via dense-core vesicle exocytosis, is required to locally activate the neuronal G alpha(s) pathway near synaptic active zones.",

        "Title": "Kinetic rates of antibody binding correlate with neutralization sensitivity of variant simian immunodeficiency virus strains.",
        "Abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that an effective AIDS vaccine will need to elicit both broadly reactive humoral and cellular immune responses. Potent and cross-reactive neutralization of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies is well documented. However, the mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization have not been defined. The current study was designed to determine whether the specificity and quantitative properties of antibody binding to SIV envelope proteins correlate with neutralization. Using a panel of rhesus monoclonal antibodies previously characterized for their ability to bind and neutralize variant SIVs, we compared the kinetic rates and affinity of antibody binding to soluble envelope trimers by using surface plasmon resonance. We identified significant differences in the kinetic rates but not the affinity of monoclonal antibody binding to the neutralization-sensitive SIV/17E-CL and neutralization-resistant SIVmac239 envelope proteins that correlated with the neutralization sensitivities of the corresponding virus strains. These results suggest for the first time that neutralization resistance may be related to quantitative differences in the rates but not the affinity of the antibody-envelope interaction and may provide one mechanism for the inherent resistance of SIVmac239 to neutralization in vitro. Further, we provide evidence that factors in addition to antibody binding, such as epitope specificity, contribute to the mechanisms of neutralization of SIV/17E-CL in vitro. This study will impact the method by which HIV/SIV vaccines are evaluated and will influence the design of candidate AIDS vaccines capable of eliciting effective neutralizing antibody responses.",

        "Abstract": "Complications of diabetes mellitus within the nervous system are peripheral and central neuropathy. In peripheral neuropathy, defects in neurofilament and microtubules have been demonstrated. In this study, we examined the effects of insulin deficiency within the brain in insulin knockout mice (I-/-). The I-/- exhibited hyperphosphorylation of tau, at threonine 231, and neurofilament. In addition, we showed hyperphosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3 beta) at serine 9. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK 1) showed decrease in phosphorylation, whereas ERK 2 showed no changes. Ultrastructural examination demonstrated swollen mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus, and dispersion of the nuclear chromatin. Microtubules showed decrease in the number of intermicrotubule bridges and neurofilament presented as bunches. Thus, lack of insulin brain stimulation induces JNK hyperphosphorylation followed by hyperphosphorylation of tau and neurofilament, and ultrastructural cellular damage, that over time may induce decrease in cognition and learning disabilities.",

        "Abstract": "Priming of leukemic cells with cytokines may enhance the efficacy of cell-cycle chemotherapy. In this study, we utilized these synergistic effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF, sargramostim [Leukine]), hydroxyurea, and low-dose cytosine arabinoside to treat elderly patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In a single-institution, retrospective study, we evaluated 94 treatments with concomitant hydroxyurea, cytosine arabinoside, and GM-CSF between the years of 1997 and 2003 in high-risk elderly patients with AML or MDS. A total of 80% of patients received all of the GM-CSF doses; 78% of patients received all of the cytosine arabinoside doses. Adverse events were minimal. No patient developed mucositis or alopecia. The most common adverse event was neutropenic fever, which was noted in 57% of patients. Twenty-one percent of patients remained neutropenic after treatment until death or relapse. Sixty-eight percent of patients reached an absolute neutrophil count of greater than 1000 microL in a median of 33.5 days. Our data show an overall response rate of 52%, with a complete response rate of 39% and a partial response rate of 13%. Overall, our study showed that low-dose cytosine arabinoside given by continuous infusion together with continuous infusion GM-CSF and hydroxyurea was well-tolerated and effective in treating elderly AML and MDS patients who were not eligible for standard induction therapy.",

        "Abstract": "A review of the operational health physics papers published in Health Physics and Operational Radiation Safety over the past fifteen years indicated seventeen general categories or areas into which the topics could be readily separated. These areas include academic research programs, use of computers in operational health physics, decontamination and decommissioning, dosimetry, emergency response, environmental health physics, industrial operations, medical health physics, new procedure development, non-ionizing radiation, radiation measurements, radioactive waste disposal, radon measurement and control, risk communication, shielding evaluation and specification, staffing levels for health physics programs, and unwanted or orphan sources. That is not to say that there are no operational papers dealing with specific areas of health physics, such as power reactor health physics, accelerator health physics, or governmental health physics. On the contrary, there have been a number of excellent operational papers from individuals in these specialty areas and they are included in the broader topics listed above. A listing and review of all the operational papers that have been published is beyond the scope of this discussion. However, a sampling of the excellent operational papers that have appeared in Health Physics and Operational Radiation Safety is presented to give the reader the flavor of the wide variety of concerns to the operational health physicist and the current areas of interest where procedures are being refined and solutions to problems are being developed.",

        "Title": "Determination of active ingredient within pharmaceutical preparations using flow injection mass spectrometry.",
        "Abstract": "Two separate pharmaceutical blends, one containing 2% caffeine by weight, the other containing 2% creatine by weight, and 200 mg caffeine tablets were examined in this study. The purpose of the analyses was to determine the feasibility of using flow injection mass spectrometry for the quantitative analysis of active ingredient within a drug product or other form of pharmaceutical preparation. For more precise and accurate measurements, it was necessary to incorporate an internal reference within the samples. Further, flow injection analysis showed to provide quicker, more facile method development than the application of chromatographic separation. Samples were analyzed over an analyte concentration range of 5.0-15.0 microg/mL. Analyte selectivity was obtained through the observance of the (M+H)(+) ions generated by positive electrospray ionization of each of the analytes (m/z 195 for caffeine and m/z 132 for creatine), and accurate quantitation was achieved by determining the ratio of the analyte response versus the response of the incorporated reference compound. Sample-to-sample precision in these measurements was less than 3%, recovery values were shown to be accurate to within +/-3% of the actual values, and both analytical methods proved to be linear over the assay range (R(2)> or =0.999). Due to the excellent selectivity and low detection limits available to mass spectrometric detection, flow injection mass spectrometric analysis could be particularly applicable for analysis of formulations that contain either low doses of active ingredient, active ingredient with low solubility, or active ingredient that does not possess a strong chromophore. Additionally, this type of methodology shows to be conducive for rapid method development.",

The interviews covered 3 areas: life in prewar Bosnia, the journey of exile, and, most centrally, life in Chicago. Primary sources of exile-related distress included social isolation and the loss of community, separation from family members, the loss of important life projects, a lack of environmental mastery, poverty and related stressors such as inadequate housing, and the loss of valued social roles. The implications of these findings for mental health interventions with refugees are considered, and the value of narrative methods in research with refugee communities is discussed.",

Fifteen therapists and 15 interpreters were interviewed at 14 refugee mental health treatment centers in the United States. Core findings concerned the impact of interpreters on the therapeutic alliance, the complex emotional reactions that may arise within the therapy triad, the effects of interpreting on interpreters' own well-being, the multiple roles that interpreters play in addition to translating language, and the training and supervision needs of interpreters and of therapists who work with them. Implications of these findings for agencies that use interpreters in their clinical work with refugees are considered, and specific recommendations are made concerning the hiring, training, and support of interpreting staff.",

        "Abstract": "The feasibility of intensified therapy in adults < 61-years-old with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was evaluated by adding high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) to conventional induction therapy and in post-remission therapy prior to peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Patients were treated with conventional induction therapy (daunorubicin days 1-3 and cytarabine days 1-7), followed by HDAC (2 gm/M2) every 12 h ( x 6) on days 8-10. Patients in complete remission (CR) with HLA-matched siblings were assigned to allogeneic PBSCT; the others received two courses of HDAC (3 gm/M2 every 12 h on days 1, 3, and 5) given 1 month apart. Peripheral blood stem cells were then harvested and infused after high-dose chemotherapy. Of 62 eligible, evaluable patients, 47 (76%) achieved CR. The mortality rate was 10% (6 patients); no deaths occurred during the two post-remission courses of HDAC. Fifteen patients were assigned to allogeneic PBSCT and 32 to autologous PBSCT. All surviving patients have been followed for more than 4 years. Including all patients scheduled to receive autoPBSCT in an intent-to-treat analysis, after a median 5-year follow-up the current, non-actuarial, four-year event-free and overall survival was 47% and 47%, respectively. Intensified induction therapy was associated with more toxicity than conventional induction therapy, and the CR rate did not improve. Nevertheless, intensive post-remission therapy was well tolerated, no treatment-related mortality occurred with autologous PBSCT, and disease-free survival and overall survival were lengthy.",

        "Abstract": "A review of the operational health physics papers published in Health Physics and Operational Radiation Safety over the past fifteen years indicated seventeen general categories or areas into which the topics could be readily separated. These areas include academic research programs, use of computers in operational health physics, decontamination and decommissioning, dosimetry, emergency response, environmental health physics, industrial operations, medical health physics, new procedure development, non-ionizing radiation, radiation measurements, radioactive waste disposal, radon measurement and control, risk communication, shielding evaluation and specification, staffing levels for health physics programs, and unwanted or orphan sources. That is not to say that there are no operational papers dealing with specific areas of health physics, such as power reactor health physics, accelerator health physics, or governmental health physics. On the contrary, there have been a number of excellent operational papers from individuals in these specialty areas and they are included in the broader topics listed above. A listing and review of all the operational papers that have been published is beyond the scope of this discussion. However, a sampling of the excellent operational papers that have appeared in Health Physics and Operational Radiation Safety is presented to give the reader the flavor of the wide variety of concerns to the operational health physicist and the current areas of interest where procedures are being refined and solutions to problems are being developed.",

        "Abstract": "We used gain-of-function and null synaptic signaling network mutants to investigate the relationship of the G alpha(q) and G alpha(s) pathways to synaptic vesicle priming and to each other. Genetic epistasis studies using G alpha(q) gain-of-function and null mutations, along with a mutation that blocks synaptic vesicle priming and the synaptic vesicle priming stimulator phorbol ester, suggest that the G alpha(q) pathway generates the core, obligatory signals for synaptic vesicle priming. In contrast, the G alpha(s) pathway is not required for the core priming function, because steady-state levels of neurotransmitter release are not significantly altered in animals lacking a neuronal G alpha(s) pathway, even though these animals are strongly paralyzed as a result of functional (nondevelopmental) defects. However, our genetic analysis indicates that these two functionally distinct pathways converge and that they do so downstream of DAG production. Further linking the two pathways, our epistasis analysis of a ric-8 null mutant suggests that RIC-8 (a receptor-independent G alpha guanine nucleotide exchange factor) is required to maintain both the G alpha(q) vesicle priming pathway and the neuronal G alpha(s) pathway in a functional state. We propose that the neuronal G alpha(s) pathway transduces critical positional information onto the core G alpha(q) pathway to stabilize the priming of selected synapses that are optimal for locomotion.",

        "Abstract": "To identify hypothesized missing components of the synaptic G alpha(o)-G alpha(q) signaling network, which tightly regulates neurotransmitter release, we undertook two large forward genetic screens in the model organism C. elegans and focused first on mutations that strongly rescue the paralysis of ric-8(md303) reduction-of-function mutants, previously shown to be defective in G alpha(q) pathway activation. Through high-resolution mapping followed by sequence analysis, we show that these mutations affect four genes. Two activate the G alpha(q) pathway through gain-of-function mutations in G alpha(q); however, all of the remaining mutations activate components of the G alpha(s) pathway, including G alpha(s), adenylyl cyclase, and protein kinase A. Pharmacological assays suggest that the G alpha(s) pathway-activating mutations increase steady-state neurotransmitter release, and the strongly impaired neurotransmitter release of ric-8(md303) mutants is rescued to greater than wild-type levels by the strongest G alpha(s) pathway activating mutations. Using transgene induction studies, we show that activating the G alpha(s) pathway in adult animals rapidly induces hyperactive locomotion and rapidly rescues the paralysis of the ric-8 mutant. Using cell-specific promoters we show that neuronal, but not muscle, G alpha(s) pathway activation is sufficient to rescue ric-8(md303)'s paralysis. Our results appear to link RIC-8 (synembryn) and a third major G alpha pathway, the G alpha(s) pathway, with the previously discovered G alpha(o) and G alpha(q) pathways of the synaptic signaling network.",

        "Abstract": "This paper examines the role of trust and the concept of access as they affect the relational context in which community research, and research with refugee communities in particular, is conducted. Sociologist Irving Goffman's metaphor of frontstage and backstage behavior is used to illustrate the complexity and importance of developing of relations of trust, and thereby gaining \"backstage\" access, in communities that are generally closed to outsiders. It is argued that gaining authentic (\"backstage\") access to refugee communities, as well as other communities that have developed a self-protective insularity, is essential if we are to gather data that accurately reflect the actual beliefs, feelings, and experiences of community members. The paper then examines the puzzling lack of discussion regarding issues of trust, access, and the relational context in the literature on refugee mental health. Explanations for this apparent inattention are sought in the influence of the prevailing scientific paradigm that guides most research with refugees, and that shapes the values of the field's \"gatekeepers,\" the editors and reviewers of scholarly journals. Throughout the paper, key points are illustrated with examples drawn from the author's research with refugees from Guatemala, Bosnia, and Afghanistan.",

        "Abstract": "Auditory neurobiology has benefited significantly from ethological approaches using acoustic communication signals. Developing an ethological model in a genetically manipulable system such as the mouse would enhance the ability to investigate the processing, learning, and recognition of sounds. Characterizing the basic acoustic structure of mouse vocalizations would help lay a foundation for such a future study. Towards this goal, ultrasound vocalizations emitted by isolated mouse pups and pairs of adult males and females have been digitally recorded and examined. Previous work suggests that these calls may have communicative significance. An analysis of the natural variability in their spectral content, median frequency, duration, and repetition period reveals acoustic structure that could be used for recognizing the calls. Other parameters, like the rate of frequency modulation, may also be informative, but have not been examined. Pup isolation calls develop systematically between postnatal day 5 and 12 towards a more stereotyped vocalization--contracting from a wide range of values into narrower clusters of frequency and duration, and shifting from longer to shorter repetition periods. Most significantly, pup isolation and adult encounter calls fall into two distinct spectral and temporal categories, making it possible for a receiver to acoustically distinguish between them, and to potentially categorically perceive them along those dimensions.",

        "Abstract": "Reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantations for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients have been limited by significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), treatment-related mortality, and disease relapse. We treated 18 MDS patients ineligible for standard allogeneic transplantation with a preparative regimen of photopheresis day -7 and -6, pentostatin 4 mg/m(2) by continuous infusion day -5 and -4, and total body irradiation 600 cGy in 3 fractions day -3 and -2, followed by allogeneic stem cell infusion from 6/6 or 5/6 HLA-matched related donors or 6/6 HLA-matched unrelated donors. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin A and a short course of methotrexate. The median age was 54 years (range, 30-70 years). Diagnoses included refractory anemia (n = 2), refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (n = 2), refractory anemia with excess blasts (n = 10), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (n = 3), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 1). Sixteen of 18 patients developed full donor chimerism with no day +100 transplant-related mortality. Grade II to IV acute GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD developed in 19% and 18% of patients, respectively. Disease relapse occurred in 2 patients. At a median follow-up of 14 months (range, 1-35 months), the 1-year failure-free and overall survival were 64% and 65%, respectively. Our photopheresis and pentostatin-based reduced-intensity preparative regimen for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in high-risk MDS patients achieves successful donor engraftment and disease remission with less transplant toxicity and grade II to IV acute GVHD.",

        "Abstract": "Previously, we proposed a model of the circuitry underlying simple-cell responses in cat primary visual cortex (V1) layer 4. We argued that the ordered arrangement of lateral geniculate nucleus inputs to a simple cell must be supplemented by a component of feedforward inhibition that is untuned for orientation and responds to high temporal frequencies to explain the sharp contrast-invariant orientation tuning and low-pass temporal frequency tuning of simple cells. The temporal tuning also requires a significant NMDA component in geniculocortical synapses. Recent experiments have revealed cat V1 layer 4 inhibitory neurons with two distinct types of receptive fields (RFs): complex RFs with mixed ON/OFF responses lacking in orientation tuning, and simple RFs with normal, sharp-orientation tuning (although, some respond to all orientations). We show that complex inhibitory neurons can provide the inhibition needed to explain simple-cell response properties. Given this complex cell inhibition, antiphase or \"push-pull\" inhibition from tuned simple inhibitory neurons acts to sharpen spatial frequency tuning, lower responses to low temporal frequency stimuli, and increase the stability of cortical activity.",

        "Abstract": "We model the effects of excitation and inhibition on the gain of cortical neurons. Previous theoretical work has concluded that excitation or inhibition alone will not cause a multiplicative gain change in the curve of firing rate versus input current. However, such gain changes in vivo are measured in the curve of firing rate versus stimulus parameter. We find that when this curve is considered, and when the nonlinear relationships between stimulus parameter and input current and between input current and firing rate in vivo are taken into account, then simple excitation or inhibition alone can induce a multiplicative gain change. In particular, the power-law relationship between voltage and firing rate that is induced by neuronal noise is critical to this result. This suggests an unexpectedly simple mechanism that may underlie the gain modulations commonly observed in cortex. More generally, it suggests that a smaller input will multiplicatively modulate the gain of a larger one when both converge on a common cortical target.",

        "Abstract": "beta-Arrestin-1 (betaArr1) plays a major role in the desensitization and internalization of G protein-coupled receptors. We previously localized betaArr1 in the sensory neurons of rat lumbar 4 and 5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and reported the predominant presence of betaArr1 in the small-diameter DRG neurons that are often implicated with nociception. Because of betaArr1's crucial role in regulating the initiation of cellular signaling, in the current study we evaluated the distribution of betaArr1 in the peripheral sensory terminals where various receptors are present. Western blotting confirmed the presence of betaArr1 immunoreactivity in the rat skin. Sciatic nerve ligation demonstrated that betaArr1 is transported peripherally from the DRG, and immunohistochemistry showed betaArr1 immunoreactivity in the glabrous skin of the rat hindpaw. In the glabrous skin, strong betaArr1 immunoreactivity was detected in nerve fibers in the dermal nerve plexus and dermal papillae. Fine varicose immunoreactive fibers were found in the epidermis. In addition, betaArr1 was observed in specialized sensory receptors such as Meissner corpuscles. Our observations thus indicate that betaArr1 may be involved in modulation of specific tactile stimulation from the skin in addition to nociception.",

        "Abstract": "Cytogenetic analysis can be important in determining the prognosis and diagnosis of a number of hematological disorders, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Here, we compared metaphase chromosomal analyses on bone marrow aspirates from MDS patients with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes specific for chromosomes nos. 5, 7, 8, 11, 13 and 20. Forty-three patients enrolled in ECOG protocol E1996 for low risk MDS and five patients enrolled in ECOG protocol E3996 for high risk MDS were studied by both metaphase chromosomal analysis and interphase FISH. Excluding those with a clonal loss of the Y chromosome, an abnormal clone was detected by cytogenetic analysis in 18 of 48 samples (37.5%). In comparison, our FISH panel detected an abnormal clone in 17 of 48 samples (35.4%). Twenty-nine of 30 samples with apparently normal karyotypes, including those with a missing Y chromosome, were also normal by our FISH panel. One patient had an occult deletion of chromosome 11 that was detected by FISH. These results indicate that around 60% of patients with MDS do not have abnormalities that are detectable by either chromosomal or FISH studies. In addition, it appears that interphase FISH studies are nearly as sensitive as cytogenetic analyses and can be a useful tool in studying bone marrow aspirates where cytogenetic analysis is not possible.",

        "Abstract": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) causes significant morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation following either a conventional or reduced-intensity preparative regimen. In a murine model, inactivation of host dendritic cells (DCs) was associated with a significant reduction in acute GVHD, suggesting that host DCs may play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute GVHD. The role of host DCs in the development of GVHD following allogeneic stem cell transplantation in humans, however, is unclear. We examined DC chimerism in patients with various hematologic malignancies who underwent a reduced-intensity preparative regimen of extracorporeal photophoresis, pentostatin, and reduced-dose total body irradiation (n = 21) or a conventional preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (n = 3). Full donor hematopoietic reconstitution was demonstrated in 19 of 21 patients who underwent a reduced-intensity preparative regimen and in all patients who underwent a conventional preparative regimen. Grade 0 to I acute GVHD and limited or no chronic GVHD were observed in 18 patients who underwent a reduced-intensity regimen and 1 patient who underwent a conventional regimen who achieved full donor DC chimerism at day +100 posttransplantation. In contrast, grade II to IV acute GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD were observed in the 2 patients who underwent a conventional regimen and the 1 patient who underwent a reduced-intensity regimen who had host rather than donor DC chimerism. The persistence of host DCs at day +100 posttransplantation is correlated with the development of severe acute and chronic GVHD (P =.001). Host DCs may represent a therapeutic target for reducing GVHD in allogeneic bone marrow transplants.",

        "Abstract": "Some evidence shows that the upper cervical spinal cord might play an important role in propriospinal processing as a sensory filter and modulator for visceral afferents. The aims of this study were to determine (1). the responses of C(1)-C(2) spinal neurons to gastric distension and (2). the relative contribution of vagal and spinal visceral afferent pathways for transmission of gastric input to the upper cervical spinal cord. Extracellular potentials of single C(1)-C(2) spinal neurons were recorded in pentobarbital anesthetized male rats. Graded gastric distension (20-80 mm Hg) was produced by air inflation of a latex balloon surgically placed in the stomach. Sixteen percent of the neurons (32/198) responded to gastric distension; 17 neurons were excited and 15 neurons were inhibited by gastric distension. Spontaneous activity of neurons with inhibitory responses was higher than those neurons with excitatory responses (18.1+/-2.7 vs. 3.8+/-1.7 impulses s(-1), p<0.001). Twenty-eight of thirty-two (87.5%) neurons responded to mechanical stimulation of somatic fields on head, neck, ears or shoulder. Most lesion sites of neurons with excitatory responses were found in laminae V, VII; however, neurons with inhibitory responses were in laminae III, IV. Bilateral cervical vagotomy abolished responses of 4/8 neurons tested. Spinal transection at C(6)-C(7) abolished responses of the other four neurons that still responded to gastric distension after bilateral vagotomy. Results of these data supported the concept that a group of C(1)-C(2) spinal neurons might play a role in processing sensory information from the stomach that travels in vagal and spinal visceral afferent fibers.",

        "Title": "Chemical activation of cardiac receptors affects activity of superficial and deeper T3-T4 spinal neurons in rats.",
        "Abstract": "The purposes of this study were to examine responses of superficial (depth <300 microm) and deeper thoracic spinal neurons to chemical stimulation of cardiac afferents and effects of descending influences on these neurons. Extracellular potentials of single T(3)-T(4) neurons were recorded in pentobarbital anesthetized, paralyzed and ventilated male rats. A catheter was placed in the pericardial sac to administer 0.2 ml of a mixture of algogenic chemicals that contained adenosine (10(-3) M), bradykinin, histamine, serotonin, prostaglandin E(2) (10(-5) M). Fifteen of 55 (27%) superficial neurons responsive to intrapericardial chemicals were compared to 80/169 (47%) deeper neurons. All 15 superficial neurons that responded to cardiac afferents were excited (E), whereas 66 deeper neurons were excited, ten were inhibited and four showed excitation-inhibition. Spontaneous activity of superficial neurons with short-lasting excitatory responses was significantly lower than that of deeper neurons (P<0.05). Somatic receptive fields on chest, axilla, arm and upper back areas were found for 77/95 (81%) neurons that responded to intrapericardial chemicals. The proportion of somatic field properties and their sizes in superficial neurons were similar to deeper neurons. After cervical spinal transection, both spontaneous activity and responses to chemical stimulation of cardiac afferents significantly increased in six out of six neurons excited by intrapericardial injections. Results showed that chemical stimulation of cardiac afferents excited superficial T(3)-T(4) spinal neurons, whereas deeper neurons exhibited multiple patterns of responses. Some characteristics of subgroups of superficial neurons were quantitatively different from deeper neurons. Thoracic spinal neurons processing cardiac nociceptive information were under tonic descending inhibition.",

        "Title": "Understanding layer 4 of the cortical circuit: a model based on cat V1.",
        "Abstract": "This paper reviews theoretical and experimental results on the processing of layer 4, the input-recipient layer, of cat primary visual cortex (V1). A wide range of experimental data can be understood from a model in which response tuning of layer 4 cells is largely determined by a local interplay of feedforward excitation (from thalamus) and feedforward inhibition (from layer 4 inhibitory interneurons driven by thalamus). Feedforward inhibition dominates excitation, inherits its tuning from the thalamic input and sharpens the tuning of excitatory cells. At least a strong component of the feedforward inhibition received by a cell is spatially opponent to the excitation it receives, meaning that inhibition is driven by dark in regions of the visual field in which excitation is driven by light, and vice versa. The idea of opponent inhibition can be generalized to mean inhibition driven by input patterns that are strongly anti-correlated with the patterns that excite a cell. This paper argues that dominant feedforward opponent inhibition may be a general principle of cortical layer 4. This leads to the suggestion that the properties that show columnar organization--invariance across the vertical depth of cortex--may be properties that are shared by 'opposite' (anticorrelated) stimulus pairs. This contrasts with the more common idea that a column represents a set of cells that all share similar stimulus preferences.",

        "Abstract": "Thrombocytopenia is a poor prognostic indicator in the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Treatment options for patients with symptomatic thrombocytopenia are limited. Danazol, an attenuated androgen, may have some efficacy in increasing the platelet count of patients with MDS. We retrospectively reviewed 33 patients with primary MDS who were treated with danazol for 6 or more weeks. After 6 weeks on danazol, the mean platelet count increased from 42 x 10(9)/L to 60 x 10(9)/L (P < 0.015), and 25 out of 33 patients (76%) had an increase in their platelet counts. Following 12 weeks of treatment, the mean platelet count increased to 67 x 10(9)/L (P < 0.005), and 21 out of 29 patients (72%) had an increase in their platelet counts. Seven out of nine patients no longer required platelet transfusions because bleeding stopped after 6 weeks on danazol. Mean duration of response was 10 months (range 2-68 months). Responses were seen in all French-American-British (FAB) subtypes and in all International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) scores. Therapy was well tolerated. Danazol may be effective in MDS patients who are thrombocytopenic.",

As hypothesized, exposure to war-related violence was highly predictive of PTSD symptoms in both groups; in addition, social isolation was significantly related to PTSD symptomatology in the community group. In contrast, depressive symptomatology was accounted for primarily by the exile-related stressors. For the clinical group, depressive symptoms were also accounted for by experiences of war-related loss. The implications of these findings for mental health interventions with refugees are considered.",

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among Western nations, and is more common in the elderly than in younger individuals. With the general acceptance of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, the current consideration is that colorectal cancer is preventable if all adenomas are removed before they have the chance to progress to cancer. To that end, physicians should now advocate screening for colorectal cancer and through this effort a large number of patients with adenomatous polyps will be discovered. It is important to understand the strategy in dealing with this growing population of patients with adenomas. After an initial polypectomy, patients with adenomas should be entered into a surveillance program to detect and remove recurrent adenomas. Recommended surveillance intervals are shorter for patients with a family history of colorectal cancer, those with multiple adenomas (>2), large adenomas (> or = 1cm), or those whose adenomas have high-grade dysplasia, villous architecture, or that are cancerous. Effective chemoprevention would be a potential method of lengthening colonoscopic surveillance intervals. Unfortunately, no treatment has been found to be effective enough to alter our current surveillance practice. The only recommendation that can be made at this time for those patients with a history of colonic adenomas is to add 3 g/day of calcium carbonate to their diet, though its effect on adenoma recurrence is modest.",

        "Abstract": "Extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) has been shown to be an effective therapy for patients with acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, but its biologic mechanism is not understood. We reported that clinical response to ECP was associated not only with normalization of skewed CD4/CD8 ratios but also with an increase in CD3(-)/CD56(+) natural killer cells and a decrease in the number of CD80(+) and CD123(+) circulating dendritic cells (DCs). To further elucidate the effects of ECP on activated lymphocyte subpopulations and the interaction between effector lymphocytes and antigen-presenting DCs, we isolated and characterized DC populations from patients with chronic GVHD undergoing ECP therapy. Antigen-presenting activity of DCs was measured as proliferation of antigen-stimulated autologous and allogeneic T cells by mixed-lymphocyte reaction (MLR). In MLR assays the proliferation of T cells was decreased in all 10 patients by a mean of 84% (range, 75%-95%; P < or =.002) after a 2-day cycle of ECP and longitudinally over the 12-month course of therapy. Immunophenotypic analysis of DC populations revealed a preponderance of DC1 monocytic dendritic cells in all patients before the initiation of ECP. Nine of 10 patients demonstrated a shift from DC1 to DC2 and as a concordant shift from a predominantly Th1 (interleukin-2 [IL-2], interferon-gamma) to Th2 (IL-4, IL-10) cytokine profile after ECP, and 8 of 10 had a clinical response to ECP. Our results suggest that ECP alters alloreactivity by affecting allo-targeted effector T cells and antigen-presenting DCs.",

        "Abstract": "Supporting glial cells of the peripheral nervous system include satellite cells of dorsal root ganglia and Schwann cells of peripheral nerves. In the central nervous system, glial cells contain enzymes related to the tricarboxylic acid and glutamine cycles: pyruvate carboxylase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and glutamine synthetase. The present study used immunohistochemistry in the rat peripheral nervous system to determine the cellular distribution of these enzymes along with glutamine. In dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerves, glutamine and glutamine related enzymes were enriched in satellite and Schwann cells. In the dorsal root ganglia, immunoreactive satellite cells surrounded neurons of all sizes. In peripheral nerve, immunoreactive Schwann cells were most easily observed surrounding large diameter, myelinated axons. These Schwann cells contained immunoreactivity in their cell bodies, nodes of Ranvier, and the rim of cytoplasm outside the myelin sheath. Myelin sheaths were non-immunoreactive. The peripheral glial tricarboxylic and glutamine cycles may be used to produce glutamine for neuronal cell uptake and conversion to glutamate for synaptic transmission. Alternatively, these cycles may function in peripheral glia similar to central nervous system astrocytes for supporting the energy demands of neurons.",

        "Title": "LGN input to simple cells and contrast-invariant orientation tuning: an analysis.",
        "Abstract": "We develop a new analysis of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) input to a cortical simple cell, demonstrating that this input is the sum of two terms, a linear term and a nonlinear term. In response to a drifting grating, the linear term represents the temporal modulation of input, and the nonlinear term represents the mean input. The nonlinear term, which grows with stimulus contrast, has been neglected in many previous models of simple cell response. We then analyze two scenarios by which contrast-invariance of orientation tuning may arise. In the first scenario, at larger contrasts, the nonlinear part of the LGN input, in combination with strong push-pull inhibition, counteracts the nonlinear effects of cortical spike threshold, giving the result that orientation tuning scales with contrast. In the second scenario, at low contrasts, the nonlinear component of LGN input is negligible, and noise smooths the nonlinearity of spike threshold so that the input-output function approximates a power-law function. These scenarios can be combined to yield contrast-invariant tuning over the full range of stimulus contrast. The model clarifies the contribution of LGN nonlinearities to the orientation tuning of simple cells and demonstrates how these nonlinearities may impact different models of contrast-invariant tuning.",

        "Title": "Neural noise can explain expansive, power-law nonlinearities in neural response functions.",
        "Abstract": "Many phenomenological models of the responses of simple cells in primary visual cortex have concluded that a cell's firing rate should be given by its input raised to a power greater than one. This is known as an expansive power-law nonlinearity. However, intracellular recordings have shown that a different nonlinearity, a linear-threshold function, appears to give a good prediction of firing rate from a cell's low-pass-filtered voltage response. Using a model based on a linear-threshold function, Anderson et al. showed that voltage noise was critical to converting voltage responses with contrast-invariant orientation tuning into spiking responses with contrast-invariant tuning. We present two separate results clarifying the connection between noise-smoothed linear-threshold functions and power-law nonlinearities. First, we prove analytically that a power-law nonlinearity is the only input-output function that converts contrast-invariant input tuning into contrast-invariant spike tuning. Second, we examine simulations of a simple model that assumes instantaneous spike rate is given by a linear-threshold function of voltage and voltage responses include significant noise. We show that the resulting average spike rate is well described by an expansive power law of the average voltage (averaged over multiple trials), provided that average voltage remains less than about 1.5 SDs of the noise above threshold. Finally, we use this model to show that the noise levels recorded by Anderson et al. are consistent with the degree to which the orientation tuning of spiking responses is more sharply tuned relative to the orientation tuning of voltage responses. Thus neuronal noise can robustly generate power-law input-output functions of the form frequently postulated for simple cells.",

        "Abstract": "We model the development of the functional circuit of layer 4 (the input-recipient layer) of cat primary visual cortex. The observed thalamocortical and intracortical circuitry codevelop under Hebb-like synaptic plasticity. Hebbian development yields opponent inhibition: inhibition evoked by stimuli anticorrelated with those that excite a cell. Strong opponent inhibition enables recognition of stimulus orientation in a manner invariant to stimulus contrast. These principles may apply to cortex more generally: Hebb-like plasticity can guide layer 4 of any piece of cortex to create opposition between anticorrelated stimulus pairs, and this enables recognition of specific stimulus patterns in a manner invariant to stimulus magnitude. Properties that are invariant across a cortical column are predicted to be those shared by opponent stimulus pairs; this contrasts with the common idea that a column represents cells with similar response properties.",

        "Abstract": "The termite gut flagellates are of interest because of their unusual motile organelles, their ability to digest cellulose, and their symbiotic relationship with prokaryotes inhabiting the insect gut. This report provides a detailed ultrastructural description of Pyrsonympha from the hind-gut of Reticulitermes flavipes. The motile axostyle is composed of 2,000-4,000 microtubules connected by cross-bridges. At its anterior end, the axostyle is associated with a \"primary row\" of microtubules which is associated with a fibrous network. The \"primary row\" is embedded in a large mass of amorphous, electron-dense material occupying the furthest anterior end of the cell. The basal bodies of the eight flagella are also embedded in this presumptive microtubule-organizing center. The flagella are associated with the cell surface throughout their length. Isolation and reactivation of the axostyle has demonstrated that although ATP dependent motility is inherent in the structure of the axostyle, its proper control may be mediated by the attachment of the axostyle to structures at the anterior end of the cell. Pyrsonympha lacks morphologically distinguishable mitochondria and Golgi complexes. The cell surface is covered by unique, previously underscribed, tubular specializations. Symbiotic microorganisms are observed associated with the cell surface and within the cytoplasm. Wood particles are taken up from the gut fluid by large phagocytic vacuoles formed at the posterior end of the cell. Even during the process of breakdown, the wood is always enclosed within the membrane of the phagocytic vacuole. The Pyrsonympha from Reticulitermes flavipes are not attached to the lining of the hind-gut and do not contain an attachment organelle, unlike the Pyrsonympha from other species of Reticulitermes.",
