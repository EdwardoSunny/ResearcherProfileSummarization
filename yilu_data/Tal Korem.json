        "Title": "Distributional bias compromises leave-one-out cross-validation.",
        "Abstract": "Cross-validation is a common method for estimating the predictive performance of machine learning models. In a data-scarce regime, where one typically wishes to maximize the number of instances used for training the model, an approach called 'leave-one-out cross-validation' is often used. In this design, a separate model is built for predicting each data instance after training on all other instances. Since this results in a single test data point available per model trained, predictions are aggregated across the entire dataset to calculate common rank-based performance metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic or precision-recall curves. In this work, we demonstrate that this approach creates a negative correlation between the average label of each training fold and the label of its corresponding test instance, a phenomenon that we term distributional bias. As machine learning models tend to regress to the mean of their training data, this distributional bias tends to negatively impact performance evaluation and hyperparameter optimization. We show that this effect generalizes to leave-P-out cross-validation and persists across a wide range of modeling and evaluation approaches, and that it can lead to a bias against stronger regularization. To address this, we propose a generalizable rebalanced cross-validation approach that corrects for distributional bias. We demonstrate that our approach improves cross-validation performance evaluation in synthetic simulations and in several published leave-one-out analyses.",

        "Abstract": "Every step in common microbiome profiling protocols has variable efficiency for each microbe. For example, different DNA extraction kits may have different efficiency for Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. These variable efficiencies, combined with technical variation, create strong processing biases, which impede the identification of signals that are reproducible across studies and the development of generalizable and biologically interpretable prediction models. \"Batch-correction\" methods have been used to alleviate these issues computationally with some success. However, many make strong parametric assumptions which do not necessarily apply to microbiome data or processing biases, or require the use of an outcome variable, which risks overfitting. Lastly and importantly, existing transformations used to correct microbiome data are largely non-interpretable, and could, for example, introduce values to features that were initially mostly zeros. Altogether, processing bias currently compromises our ability to glean robust and generalizable biological insights from microbiome data. Here, we present DEBIAS-M (",

Multiple peer-reviewed papers independently verified or extended our findings [2-12]. Given this impact, we carefully considered concerns by Gihawi et al. [13] that batch correction and database contamination with host sequences artificially created the appearance of cancer type-specific microbiomes. (1) We tested batch correction by comparing raw and Voom-SNM-corrected data per-batch, finding predictive equivalence and significantly similar features. We found consistent results with a modern microbiome-specific method (ConQuR [14]), and when restricting to taxa found in an independent, highly-decontaminated cohort. (2) Using Conterminator [15], we found low levels of human contamination in our original databases (~1% of genomes). We demonstrated that the increased detection of human reads in Gihawi et al. [13] was due to using a newer human genome reference. (3) We developed Exhaustive, a method twice as sensitive as Conterminator, to clean RefSeq. We comprehensively host-deplete TCGA with many human (pan)genome references. We repeated all analyses with this and the Gihawi et al. [13] pipeline, and found cancer type-specific microbiomes. These extensive re-analyses and updated methods validate our original conclusion that cancer type-specific microbial signatures exist in TCGA, and show they are robust to methodology.",

        "Abstract": "Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The vaginal microbiome has been associated with PTB, yet the mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood. Understanding microbial genetic adaptations to selective pressures, especially those related to the host, may yield insights into these associations. Here, we analyze metagenomic data from 705 vaginal samples collected during pregnancy from 40 women who delivered preterm spontaneously and 135 term controls from the Multi-Omic Microbiome Study-Pregnancy Initiative. We find that the vaginal microbiome of pregnancies that ended preterm exhibited unique genetic profiles. It was more genetically diverse at the species level, a result which we validate in an additional cohort, and harbored a higher richness and diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes, likely promoted by transduction. Interestingly, we find that Gardnerella species drove this higher genetic diversity, particularly during the first half of the pregnancy. We further present evidence that Gardnerella spp. underwent more frequent recombination and stronger purifying selection in genes involved in lipid metabolism. Overall, our population genetics analyses reveal associations between the vaginal microbiome and PTB and suggest that evolutionary processes acting on vaginal microbes may play a role in adverse pregnancy outcomes such as PTB.",

Microbiome alterations have been associated with progression from the precursor Barrett's esophagus (BE) to EAC, yet the oral microbiome, tightly linked to the esophageal microbiome and easier to sample, has not been extensively studied in this context. We aimed to assess the relationship between the salivary microbiome and neoplastic progression in BE to identify microbiome-related factors that may drive EAC development. We collected clinical data and oral health and hygiene history and characterized the salivary microbiome from 250 patients with and without BE, including 78 with advanced neoplasia (high grade dysplasia or early adenocarcinoma). We assessed differential relative abundance of taxa by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and associations between microbiome composition and clinical features and used microbiome metabolic modeling to predict metabolite production. We found significant shifts and increased dysbiosis associated with progression to advanced neoplasia, with these associations occurring independent of tooth loss, and the largest shifts were with the genus ",

Methods for in silico decontamination using controls are routinely used, but do not make optimal use of information shared across samples and cannot handle taxa that only partially originate in contamination or leakage of biological material into controls. Here we present Source tracking for Contamination Removal in microBiomes (SCRuB), a probabilistic in silico decontamination method that incorporates shared information across multiple samples and controls to precisely identify and remove contamination. We validate the accuracy of SCRuB in multiple data-driven simulations and experiments, including induced contamination, and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 15-20 times. We showcase the robustness of SCRuB across multiple ecosystems, data types and sequencing depths. Demonstrating its applicability to microbiome research, SCRuB facilitates improved predictions of host phenotypes, most notably the prediction of treatment response in melanoma patients using decontaminated tumor microbiome data.",

        "Abstract": "Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, yet its prevention and early risk stratification are limited. Previous investigations have suggested that vaginal microbes and metabolites may be implicated in sPTB. Here we performed untargeted metabolomics on 232 second-trimester vaginal samples, 80 from pregnancies ending preterm. We find multiple associations between vaginal metabolites and subsequent preterm birth, and propose that several of these metabolites, including diethanolamine and ethyl glucoside, are exogenous. We observe associations between the metabolome and microbiome profiles previously obtained using 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing, including correlations between bacteria considered suboptimal, such as Gardnerella\u2009vaginalis, and metabolites enriched in term pregnancies, such as tyramine. We investigate these associations using metabolic models. We use machine learning models to predict sPTB risk from metabolite levels, weeks to months before birth, with good accuracy (area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78). These models, which we validate using two external cohorts, are more accurate than microbiome-based and maternal covariates-based models (area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.55-0.59). Our results demonstrate the potential of vaginal metabolites as early biomarkers of sPTB and highlight exogenous exposures as potential risk factors for prematurity.",

        "Abstract": "Patterns of sequencing coverage along a bacterial genome-summarized by a peak-to-trough ratio (PTR)-have been shown to accurately reflect microbial growth rates, revealing a new facet of microbial dynamics and host-microbe interactions. Here, we introduce Compute PTR (CoPTR): a tool for computing PTRs from complete reference genomes and assemblies. Using simulations and data from growth experiments in simple and complex communities, we show that CoPTR is more accurate than the current state of the art while also providing more PTR estimates overall. We further develop a theory formalizing a biological interpretation for PTRs. Using a reference database of 2935 species, we applied CoPTR to a case-control study of 1304 metagenomic samples from 106 individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. We show that growth rates are personalized, are only loosely correlated with relative abundances, and are associated with disease status. We conclude by showing how PTRs can be combined with relative abundances and metabolomics to investigate their effect on the microbiome.",

        "Abstract": "Biomechanical and molecular processes of premature cervical remodeling preceding spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) likely result from interactions between the cervicovaginal microbiota and host immune responses. A non-optimal cervicovaginal microbiota confers increased risk of sPTB. The cervicovaginal space is metabolically active in pregancy; microbiota can produce, modify, and degrade metabolites within this ecosystem. We establish that cervicovaginal metabolomic output clusters by microbial community in pregnancy among Black individuals, revealing increased metabolism within the amino acid and dipeptide pathways as hallmarks of a non-optimal microbiota. Few differences were detected in metabolomic profiles when stratified by birth outcome. The study raises the possibility that metabolites could distinguish women with greater risk of sPTB among those with similar cervicovaginal microbiota, and that metabolites within the amino acid and carbohydrate pathways may play a role in this distinction.",

        "Abstract": "A central paradigm in microbiome data analysis, which we term the genome-centric paradigm, is that a linear (non-branching) DNA sequence is the ideal representation of a microbial genome. This representation is natural, as microbes indeed have non-branching genomes. Tremendous discoveries in microbiology were made under this paradigm, but is it always optimal for microbiome research? In this Commentary, we claim that the realization of this paradigm in metagenomic assembly, a fundamental step in the \"metagenomics analysis pipeline,\" suboptimally models the extensive genomic variability present in the microbiome. We outline our efforts to address these issues with a \"genome-free\" approach that eschews linear genomic representations in favor of a pan-metagenomic graph.",

        "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to affect the human microbiome in infected and uninfected individuals, having a substantial impact on human health over the long term. This pandemic intersects with a decades-long decline in microbial diversity and ancestral microbes due to hygiene, antibiotics, and urban living (the hygiene hypothesis). High-risk groups succumbing to COVID-19 include those with preexisting conditions, such as diabetes and obesity, which are also associated with microbiome abnormalities. Current pandemic control measures and practices will have broad, uneven, and potentially long-term effects for the human microbiome across the planet, given the implementation of physical separation, extensive hygiene, travel barriers, and other measures that influence overall microbial loss and inability for reinoculation. Although much remains uncertain or unknown about the virus and its consequences, implementing pandemic control practices could significantly affect the microbiome. In this Perspective, we explore many facets of COVID-19-induced societal changes and their possible effects on the microbiome, and discuss current and future challenges regarding the interplay between this pandemic and the microbiome. Recent recognition of the microbiome's influence on human health makes it critical to consider both how the microbiome, shaped by biosocial processes, affects susceptibility to the coronavirus and, conversely, how COVID-19 disease and prevention measures may affect the microbiome. This knowledge may prove key in prevention and treatment, and long-term biological and social outcomes of this pandemic.",

        "Abstract": "The gut microbiome has been implicated in multiple human chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Determining its mechanistic role in disease has been difficult due to apparent disconnects between animal and human studies and lack of an integrated multi-omics view of disease-specific physiological changes. We integrated longitudinal multi-omics data from the gut microbiome, metabolome, host epigenome, and transcriptome in the context of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) host physiology. We identified IBS subtype-specific and symptom-related variation in microbial composition and function. A subset of identified changes in microbial metabolites correspond to host physiological mechanisms that are relevant to IBS. By integrating multiple data layers, we identified purine metabolism as a novel host-microbial metabolic pathway in IBS with translational potential. Our study highlights the importance of longitudinal sampling and integrating complementary multi-omics data to identify functional mechanisms that can serve as therapeutic targets in a comprehensive treatment strategy for chronic GI diseases.

        "Abstract": "The collection of microbes that live in and on the human body - the human microbiome - can impact on cancer initiation, progression, and response to therapy, including cancer immunotherapy. The mechanisms by which microbiomes impact on cancers can yield new diagnostics and treatments, but much remains unknown. The interactions between microbes, diet, host factors, drugs, and cell-cell interactions within the cancer itself likely involve intricate feedbacks, and no single component can explain all the behavior of the system. Understanding the role of host-associated microbial communities in cancer systems will require a multidisciplinary approach combining microbial ecology, immunology, cancer cell biology, and computational biology - a systems biology approach.",

        "Abstract": "Differences in the presence of even a few genes between otherwise identical bacterial strains may result in critical phenotypic differences. Here we systematically identify microbial genomic structural variants (SVs) and find them to be prevalent in the human gut microbiome across phyla and to replicate in different cohorts. SVs are enriched for CRISPR-associated and antibiotic-producing functions and depleted from housekeeping genes, suggesting that they have a role in microbial adaptation. We find multiple associations between SVs and host disease risk factors, many of which replicate in an independent cohort. Exploring genes that are\u00a0clustered in the same SV, we uncover several possible mechanistic links between the microbiome and its host, including a region in Anaerostipes hadrus that encodes a composite inositol catabolism-butyrate biosynthesis pathway, the presence of which is associated with lower host metabolic disease risk. Overall, our results uncover a nascent layer of variability in the microbiome\u00a0that is associated with microbial adaptation and host health.",

        "Abstract": "Probiotics are widely prescribed for prevention of antibiotics-associated dysbiosis and related adverse effects. However, probiotic impact on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the gut mucosal host-microbiome niche remains elusive. We invasively examined the effects of multi-strain probiotics or autologous fecal microbiome transplantation (aFMT) on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the murine and human mucosal microbiome niche. Contrary to homeostasis, antibiotic perturbation enhanced probiotics colonization in the human mucosa but only mildly improved colonization in mice. Compared to spontaneous post-antibiotic recovery, probiotics induced a markedly delayed and persistently incomplete indigenous stool/mucosal microbiome reconstitution and host transcriptome recovery toward homeostatic configuration, while aFMT induced a rapid and near-complete recovery within days of administration. In\u00a0vitro, Lactobacillus-secreted soluble factors contributed to probiotics-induced microbiome inhibition. Collectively, potential post-antibiotic probiotic benefits may be offset by a compromised gut mucosal recovery, highlighting a need of developing aFMT or personalized probiotic approaches achieving mucosal protection without compromising microbiome recolonization in the antibiotics-perturbed host.",

        "Abstract": "Human gut microbiome composition is shaped by multiple factors but the relative contribution of host genetics remains elusive. Here we examine genotype and microbiome data from 1,046 healthy individuals with several distinct ancestral origins who share a relatively common environment, and demonstrate that the gut microbiome is not significantly associated with genetic ancestry, and that host genetics have a minor role in determining microbiome composition. We show that, by contrast, there are significant similarities in the compositions of the microbiomes of genetically unrelated individuals who share a household, and that over 20% of the inter-person microbiome variability is associated with factors related to diet, drugs and anthropometric measurements. We further demonstrate that microbiome data significantly improve the prediction accuracy for many human traits, such as glucose and obesity measures, compared to models that use only host genetic and environmental data. These results suggest that microbiome alterations aimed at improving clinical outcomes may be carried out across diverse genetic backgrounds.",

        "Abstract": "Bread is consumed daily by billions of people, yet evidence regarding its clinical effects is contradicting. Here, we performed a randomized crossover trial of\u00a0two 1-week-long dietary interventions comprising consumption of either traditionally made sourdough-leavened whole-grain bread or industrially made white bread. We found no significant differential effects of bread type on multiple clinical parameters. The gut microbiota composition remained person specific throughout this trial and was generally resilient to the intervention. We demonstrate statistically significant interpersonal variability in the glycemic response to different bread types, suggesting that\u00a0the lack of phenotypic difference between the bread types stems from a person-specific effect. We further show that the type of bread that induces the lower glycemic response in each person can be predicted based solely on microbiome data prior to\u00a0the intervention. Together, we present marked personalization in both bread metabolism and the gut microbiome, suggesting that understanding dietary effects requires integration of person-specific factors.",

        "Title": "Involvement of a gut-retina axis in protection against dietary glycemia-induced age-related macular degeneration.",
        "Abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the major cause of blindness in developed nations. AMD is characterized by retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cell dysfunction and loss of photoreceptor cells. Epidemiologic studies indicate important contributions of dietary patterns to the risk for AMD, but the mechanisms relating diet to disease remain unclear. Here we investigate the effect on AMD of isocaloric diets that differ only in the type of dietary carbohydrate in a wild-type aged-mouse model. The consumption of a high-glycemia (HG) diet resulted in many AMD features (AMDf), including RPE hypopigmentation and atrophy, lipofuscin accumulation, and photoreceptor degeneration, whereas consumption of the lower-glycemia (LG) diet did not. Critically, switching from the HG to the LG diet late in life arrested or reversed AMDf. LG diets limited the accumulation of advanced glycation end products, long-chain polyunsaturated lipids, and their peroxidation end-products and increased C3-carnitine in retina, plasma, or urine. Untargeted metabolomics revealed microbial cometabolites, particularly serotonin, as protective against AMDf. Gut microbiota were responsive to diet, and we identified microbiota in the Clostridiales order as being associated with AMDf and the HG diet, whereas protection from AMDf was associated with the Bacteroidales order and the LG diet. Network analysis revealed a nexus of metabolites and microbiota that appear to act within a gut-retina axis to protect against diet- and age-induced AMDf. The findings indicate a functional interaction between dietary carbohydrates, the metabolome, including microbial cometabolites, and AMDf. Our studies suggest a simple dietary intervention that may be useful in patients to arrest AMD.",

        "Abstract": "The intestinal microbiota undergoes diurnal compositional and functional oscillations that affect metabolic homeostasis, but the mechanisms by which the rhythmic microbiota influences host circadian activity remain elusive. Using integrated multi-omics and imaging approaches, we demonstrate that the gut microbiota features oscillating biogeographical localization and metabolome patterns that determine the rhythmic exposure of the intestinal epithelium to different bacterial species and their metabolites over the course of a day. This diurnal microbial behavior drives, in turn, the global programming of the host circadian transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolite oscillations. Surprisingly, disruption of homeostatic microbiome rhythmicity not only abrogates normal chromatin and transcriptional oscillations of the host, but also incites genome-wide de novo oscillations in both intestine and liver, thereby impacting diurnal fluctuations of host physiology and disease susceptibility. As such, the rhythmic biogeography and metabolome of the intestinal microbiota regulates the temporal organization and functional outcome of host transcriptional and epigenetic programs.",

The gut microbiome, our \"second genome,\" dynamically integrates signals from the host and its environment, impacting health and risk of disease. Herein, we summarize how individualized characterization of the microbiome composition and function may assist in personalized diagnostic assessment, risk stratification, disease prevention, treatment decision-making, and patients' follow up. We further discuss the limitations, pitfalls, and challenges that the microbiome field faces in integrating patient-specific microbial data into the clinical realm. Finally, we highlight how recent insights into personalized modulation of the microbiome, by nutritional and pre-, pro-, and post-biotic intervention, may lead to development of individualized approaches that may enable us to harness the microbiome as a central precision medicine target.",

        "Abstract": "Host-microbiome co-evolution drives homeostasis and disease susceptibility, yet regulatory principles governing the integrated intestinal host-commensal microenvironment remain obscure. While inflammasome signaling participates in these interactions, its activators and microbiome-modulating mechanisms are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the microbiota-associated metabolites taurine, histamine, and spermine shape the host-microbiome interface by co-modulating NLRP6 inflammasome signaling, epithelial IL-18 secretion, and downstream anti-microbial peptide (AMP) profiles. Distortion of this balanced AMP landscape by inflammasome deficiency drives dysbiosis development. Upon fecal transfer, colitis-inducing microbiota hijacks this microenvironment-orchestrating machinery through metabolite-mediated inflammasome suppression, leading to distorted AMP balance favoring its preferential colonization. Restoration of the metabolite-inflammasome-AMP axis reinstates a normal microbiota and ameliorates colitis. Together, we identify microbial modulators of the NLRP6 inflammasome and highlight mechanisms by which microbiome-host interactions cooperatively drive microbial community stability through metabolite-mediated innate immune modulation. Therefore, targeted \"postbiotic\" metabolomic intervention may restore a normal microenvironment as treatment or prevention of dysbiosis-driven diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Elevated postprandial blood glucose levels constitute a global epidemic and a major risk factor for prediabetes and type II diabetes, but existing dietary methods for controlling them have limited efficacy. Here, we continuously monitored week-long glucose levels in an 800-person cohort, measured responses to 46,898 meals, and found high variability in the response to identical meals, suggesting that universal dietary recommendations may have limited utility. We devised a machine-learning algorithm that integrates blood parameters, dietary habits, anthropometrics, physical activity, and gut microbiota measured in this cohort and showed that it accurately predicts personalized postprandial glycemic response to real-life meals. We validated these predictions in an independent 100-person cohort. Finally, a blinded randomized controlled dietary intervention based on this algorithm resulted in significantly lower postprandial responses and consistent alterations to gut microbiota configuration. Together, our results suggest that personalized diets may successfully modify elevated postprandial blood glucose and its metabolic consequences. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",

        "Abstract": "Metagenomic sequencing increased our understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease, yet it only provides a snapshot of a highly dynamic ecosystem. Here, we show that the pattern of metagenomic sequencing read coverage for different microbial genomes contains a single trough and a single peak, the latter coinciding with the bacterial origin of replication. Furthermore, the ratio of sequencing coverage between the peak and trough provides a quantitative measure of a species' growth rate. We demonstrate this in vitro and in vivo, under different growth conditions, and in complex bacterial communities. For several bacterial species, peak-to-trough coverage ratios, but not relative abundances, correlated with the manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease and type II diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "Non-caloric artificial sweeteners (NAS) are common food supplements consumed by millions worldwide as means of combating weight gain and diabetes, by retaining sweet taste without increasing caloric intake. While they are considered safe, there is increasing controversy regarding their potential ability to promote metabolic derangements in some humans. We recently demonstrated that NAS consumption could induce glucose intolerance in mice and distinct human subsets, by functionally altering the gut microbiome. In this commentary, we discuss these findings in the context of previous and recent works demonstrating the effects of NAS on host health and the microbiome, and the challenges and open questions that need to be addressed in understanding the effects of NAS consumption on human health.",

        "Abstract": "All domains of life feature diverse molecular clock machineries that synchronize physiological processes to diurnal environmental fluctuations. However, no mechanisms are known to cross-regulate prokaryotic and eukaryotic circadian rhythms in multikingdom ecosystems. Here, we show that the intestinal microbiota, in both mice and humans, exhibits diurnal oscillations that are influenced by feeding rhythms, leading to time-specific compositional and functional profiles over the course of a day. Ablation of host molecular clock components or induction of jet lag leads to aberrant microbiota\u00a0diurnal fluctuations and dysbiosis, driven by impaired feeding rhythmicity. Consequently, jet-lag-induced dysbiosis in both mice and humans promotes glucose intolerance and obesity that are transferrable to germ-free mice upon fecal transplantation. Together, these findings provide evidence of coordinated metaorganism diurnal rhythmicity and offer a microbiome-dependent mechanism for common metabolic disturbances in humans with aberrant circadian rhythms, such as those documented in shift workers and frequent flyers.",

NAS consumption is considered safe and beneficial owing to their low caloric content, yet supporting scientific data remain sparse and controversial. Here we demonstrate that consumption of commonly used NAS formulations drives the development of glucose intolerance through induction of compositional and functional alterations to the intestinal microbiota. These NAS-mediated deleterious metabolic effects are abrogated by antibiotic treatment, and are fully transferrable to germ-free mice upon faecal transplantation of microbiota configurations from NAS-consuming mice, or of microbiota anaerobically incubated in the presence of NAS. We identify NAS-altered microbial metabolic pathways that are linked to host susceptibility to metabolic disease, and demonstrate similar NAS-induced dysbiosis and glucose intolerance in healthy human subjects. Collectively, our results link NAS consumption, dysbiosis and metabolic abnormalities, thereby calling for a reassessment of massive NAS usage.",
