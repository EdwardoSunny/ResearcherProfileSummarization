        "Abstract": "Activating signal co-integrator complex 1 (ASCC1) acts with ASCC-ALKBH3 complex in alkylation damage responses. ASCC1 uniquely combines two evolutionarily ancient domains: nucleotide-binding K-Homology (KH) (associated with regulating splicing, transcriptional, and translation) and two-histidine phosphodiesterase (PDE; associated with hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotide phosphate bonds). Germline mutations link loss of ASCC1 function to spinal muscular atrophy with congenital bone fractures 2 (SMABF2). Herein analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) suggests ASCC1 RNA overexpression in certain tumors correlates with poor survival, Signatures 29 and 3 mutations, and genetic instability markers. We determined crystal structures of Alvinella pompejana (Ap) ASCC1 and Human (Hs) PDE domain revealing high-resolution details and features conserved over 500 million years of evolution. Extending our understanding of the KH domain Gly-X-X-Gly sequence motif, we define a novel structural Helix-Clasp-Helix (HCH) nucleotide binding motif and show ASCC1 sequence-specific binding to CGCG-containing RNA. The V-shaped PDE nucleotide binding channel has two His-\u03a6-Ser/Thr-\u03a6 (HXT) motifs (\u03a6 being hydrophobic) positioned to initiate cyclic phosphate bond hydrolysis. A conserved atypical active-site histidine torsion angle implies a novel PDE substrate. Flexible active site loop and arginine-rich domain linker appear regulatory. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) revealed aligned KH-PDE RNA binding sites with limited flexibility in solution. Quantitative evolutionary bioinformatic analyses of disease and cancer-associated mutations support implied functional roles for RNA binding, phosphodiesterase activity, and regulation. Collective results inform ASCC1's roles in transactivation and alkylation damage responses, its targeting by structure-based inhibitors, and how ASCC1 mutations may impact inherited disease and cancer.",

        "Abstract": "In addition to the main, protein-coding, open reading frame (mORF), many eukaryotic mRNAs contain upstream ORFs (uORFs) initiated at AUG or near-cognate codons residing 5' of the mORF start site. Whereas translation of uORFs generally represses translation of the mORFs, a subset of uORFs serves as a nexus for regulating translation of the mORF. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms by which uORFs can repress or stimulate mRNA translation, highlight uORF-mediated translational repression involving ribosome queuing, and critically evaluate recently described alternatives to the delayed reinitiation model for uORF-mediated regulation of the ",

        "Abstract": "Cotinus coggygria has a number of applications in traditional medicine most of which are connected with its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. Since inflammation and oxidative stress are recognized as triggering factors for cancer, anti-cancer activity has also been documented and the possible mechanisms of this activity are under investigation. Important components of C. coggygria extracts are shown to be hydrolysable gallotannins of which pentagalloyl-O-glucose has been studied in details. This compound inhibits various enzymes including prolyl oligopeptidase which is involved in tumorigenesis and tumour growth. According to our pilot studies, oligo-O-galloylglucoses with more than five galloyl residues are also presented in the herb of Bulgarian origin, but their activities have not been examined.",

        "Title": "eEF2 diphthamide modification restrains spurious frameshifting to maintain translational fidelity.",
        "Abstract": "Diphthamide (DPH), a conserved amino acid modification on eukaryotic translation elongation factor eEF2, is synthesized via a complex, multi-enzyme pathway. While DPH is non-essential for cell viability and its function has not been resolved, diphtheria and other bacterial toxins ADP-ribosylate DPH to inhibit translation. Characterizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants that lack DPH or show synthetic growth defects in the absence of DPH, we show that loss of DPH increases resistance to the fungal translation inhibitor sordarin and increases -1 ribosomal frameshifting at non-programmed sites during normal translation elongation and at viral programmed frameshifting sites. Ribosome profiling of yeast and mammalian cells lacking DPH reveals increased ribosomal drop-off during elongation, and removal of out-of-frame stop codons restores ribosomal processivity on the ultralong yeast MDN1 mRNA. Finally, we show that ADP-ribosylation of DPH impairs the productive binding of eEF2 to elongating ribosomes. Our results reveal that loss of DPH impairs the fidelity of translocation during translation elongation resulting in increased rates of ribosomal frameshifting throughout elongation and leading to premature termination at out-of-frame stop codons. We propose that the costly, yet non-essential, DPH modification has been conserved through evolution to maintain translational fidelity despite being a target for inactivation by bacterial toxins.",

        "Abstract": "Transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is a protein assembly essential for transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair (NER). Yet, understanding of the conformational switching underpinning these diverse TFIIH functions remains fragmentary. TFIIH mechanisms critically depend on two translocase subunits, XPB and XPD. To unravel their functions and regulation, we build cryo-EM based TFIIH models in transcription- and NER-competent states. Using simulations and graph-theoretical analysis methods, we reveal TFIIH's global motions, define TFIIH partitioning into dynamic communities and show how TFIIH reshapes itself and self-regulates depending on functional context. Our study uncovers an internal regulatory mechanism that switches XPB and XPD activities making them mutually exclusive between NER and transcription initiation. By sequentially coordinating the XPB and XPD DNA-unwinding activities, the switch ensures precise DNA incision in NER. Mapping TFIIH disease mutations onto network models reveals clustering into distinct mechanistic classes, affecting translocase functions, protein interactions and interface dynamics.",

        "Title": "A scanning-to-incision switch in TFIIH-XPG induced by DNA damage licenses nucleotide excision repair.",
        "Abstract": "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is critical for removing bulky DNA base lesions and avoiding diseases. NER couples lesion recognition by XPC to strand separation by XPB and XPD ATPases, followed by lesion excision by XPF and XPG nucleases. Here, we describe key regulatory mechanisms and roles of XPG for and beyond its cleavage activity. Strikingly, by combing single-molecule imaging and bulk cleavage assays, we found that XPG binding to the 7-subunit TFIIH core (coreTFIIH) stimulates coreTFIIH-dependent double-strand (ds)DNA unwinding 10-fold, and XPG-dependent DNA cleavage by up to 700-fold. Simultaneous monitoring of rates for coreTFIIH single-stranded (ss)DNA translocation and dsDNA unwinding showed XPG acts by switching ssDNA translocation to dsDNA unwinding as a likely committed step. Pertinent to the NER pathway regulation, XPG incision activity is suppressed during coreTFIIH translocation on DNA but is licensed when coreTFIIH stalls at the lesion or when ATP hydrolysis is blocked. Moreover, \u226515 nucleotides of 5'-ssDNA is a prerequisite for efficient translocation and incision. Our results unveil a paired coordination mechanism in which key lesion scanning and DNA incision steps are sequentially coordinated, and damaged patch removal is only licensed after generation of \u226515 nucleotides of 5'-ssDNA, ensuring the correct ssDNA bubble size before cleavage.",

        "Abstract": "How intestinal microbes regulate metabolic syndrome is incompletely understood. We show that intestinal microbiota protects against development of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and pre-diabetic phenotypes by inducing commensal-specific Th17 cells. High-fat, high-sugar diet promoted metabolic disease by depleting Th17-inducing microbes, and recovery of commensal Th17 cells restored protection. Microbiota-induced Th17 cells afforded protection by regulating lipid absorption across intestinal epithelium in an IL-17-dependent manner. Diet-induced loss of protective Th17 cells was mediated by the presence of sugar. Eliminating sugar from high-fat diets protected mice from obesity and metabolic syndrome in a manner dependent on commensal-specific Th17 cells. Sugar and ILC3 promoted outgrowth of Faecalibaculum rodentium that displaced Th17-inducing microbiota. These results define dietary and microbiota factors posing risk for metabolic syndrome. They also define a microbiota-dependent mechanism for immuno-pathogenicity of dietary sugar and highlight an elaborate interaction between diet, microbiota, and intestinal immunity in regulation of metabolic disorders.",

        "Abstract": "The immune system employs recognition tools to communicate with its microbial evolutionary partner. Among all the methods of microbial perception, T cells enable the widest spectrum of microbial recognition resolution, ranging from the crudest detection of whole groups of microbes to the finest detection of specific antigens. The application of this recognition capability to the crucial task of combatting infections has been the focus of classical immunology. We now appreciate that the coevolution of the immune system and the microbiota has led to development of a lush immunological decision tree downstream of microbial recognition, of which an inflammatory response is but one branch. In this review we discuss known T cell-microbe interactions in the gut and place them in the context of an algorithmic framework of recognition, context-dependent interpretation, and response circuits across multiple levels of microbial recognition resolution. The malleability of T cells in response to the microbiota presents an opportunity to edit immune response cellularity, identity, and functionality by utilizing microbiota-controlled pathways to promote human health.",

        "Abstract": "Transcription-coupled repair is essential for the removal of DNA lesions from the transcribed genome. The pathway is initiated by CSB protein binding to stalled RNA polymerase II. Mutations impairing CSB function cause severe genetic disease. Yet, the ATP-dependent mechanism by which CSB powers RNA polymerase to bypass certain lesions while triggering excision of others is incompletely understood. Here we build structural models of RNA polymerase II bound to the yeast CSB ortholog Rad26 in nucleotide-free and bound states. This enables simulations and graph-theoretical analyses to define partitioning of this complex into dynamic communities and delineate how its structural elements function together to remodel DNA. We identify an allosteric pathway coupling motions of the Rad26 ATPase modules to changes in RNA polymerase and DNA to unveil a structural mechanism for CSB-assisted progression past less bulky lesions. Our models allow functional interpretation of the effects of Cockayne syndrome disease mutations.",

        "Abstract": "Polyamines, small organic polycations, are essential for cell viability, and their physiological levels are homeostatically maintained by post-transcriptional regulation of key biosynthetic enzymes. In addition to de novo synthesis, cells can also take up polyamines; however, identifying cellular polyamine transporters has been challenging. Here we show that the S.\u00a0cerevisiae HOL1 mRNA is under translational control by polyamines, and we reveal that the encoded membrane transporter Hol1 is a high-affinity polyamine transporter and is required for yeast growth under limiting polyamine conditions. Moreover, we show that polyamine inhibition of the translation factor eIF5A impairs translation termination at a Pro-Ser-stop motif in a conserved upstream open reading frame on the HOL1 mRNA to repress Hol1 synthesis under conditions of elevated polyamines. Our findings reveal that polyamine transport, like polyamine biosynthesis, is under translational autoregulation by polyamines in yeast, highlighting the extensive control cells impose on polyamine levels.",

        "Abstract": "Proofreading by replicative DNA polymerases is a fundamental mechanism ensuring DNA replication fidelity. In proofreading, mis-incorporated nucleotides are excised through the 3'-5' exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme. The exonuclease site is distal from the polymerization site, imposing stringent structural and kinetic requirements for efficient primer strand transfer. Yet, the molecular mechanism of this transfer is not known. Here we employ molecular simulations using recent cryo-EM structures and biochemical analyses to delineate an optimal free energy path connecting the polymerization and exonuclease states of E. coli replicative DNA polymerase Pol III. We identify structures for all intermediates, in which the transitioning primer strand is stabilized by conserved Pol III residues along the fingers, thumb and exonuclease domains. We demonstrate switching kinetics on a tens of milliseconds timescale and unveil a complete pol-to-exo switching mechanism, validated by targeted mutational experiments.",

        "Abstract": "Critical for transcription initiation and bulky lesion DNA repair, TFIIH provides an exemplary system to connect molecular mechanisms to biological outcomes due to its strong genetic links to different specific human diseases. Recent advances in structural and computational biology provide a unique opportunity to re-examine biologically relevant molecular structures and develop possible mechanistic insights for the large dynamic TFIIH complex. TFIIH presents many puzzles involving how its two SF2 helicase family enzymes, XPB and XPD, function in transcription initiation and repair: how do they initiate transcription, detect and verify DNA damage, select the damaged strand for incision, coordinate repair with transcription and cell cycle through Cdk-activating-kinase (CAK) signaling, and result in very different specific human diseases associated with cancer, aging, and development from single missense mutations? By joining analyses of breakthrough cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures and advanced computation with data from biochemistry and human genetics, we develop unified concepts and molecular level understanding for TFIIH functions with a focus on structural mechanisms. We provocatively consider that TFIIH may have first evolved from evolutionary pressure for TCR to resolve arrested transcription blocks to DNA replication and later added its key roles in transcription initiation and global DNA repair. We anticipate that this level of mechanistic information will have significant impact on thinking about TFIIH, laying a robust foundation suitable to develop new paradigms for DNA transcription initiation and repair along with insights into disease prevention, susceptibility, diagnosis and interventions.",

        "Abstract": "Cells utilize transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms to alter gene expression in response to environmental cues. Gene-specific controls, including changing the translation of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs), provide a rapid means to respond precisely to different conditions. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are known to control the translation of mRNAs. Recent studies in bacteria and eukaryotes have revealed the functions of evolutionarily conserved uORF-encoded peptides. Some of these uORF-encoded nascent peptides enable responses to specific metabolites to modulate the translation of their mRNAs by stalling ribosomes and through ribosome stalling may also modulate the level of their mRNAs. In this review, we highlight several examples of conserved uORF nascent peptides that stall ribosomes to regulate gene expression in response to specific metabolites in bacteria, fungi, mammals, and plants.",

        "Abstract": "The regulatory mechanisms enabling the intestinal epithelium to maintain a high degree of regenerative capacity during mucosal injury remain unclear. Ex vivo survival and clonogenicity of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) strictly required growth response mediated by cell division control 42 (Cdc42) and Cdc42-deficient enteroids to undergo rapid apoptosis. Mechanistically, Cdc42 engaging with EGFR was required for EGF-stimulated, receptor-mediated endocytosis and sufficient to promote MAPK signaling. Proteomics and kinase analysis revealed that a physiologically, but nonconventionally, spliced Cdc42 variant 2 (V2) exhibited stronger MAPK-activating capability. Human CDC42-V2 is transcriptionally elevated in some colon tumor tissues. Accordingly, mice engineered to overexpress Cdc42-V2 in intestinal epithelium showed elevated MAPK signaling, enhanced regeneration, and reduced mucosal damage in response to irradiation. Overproducing Cdc42-V2 specifically in mouse ISCs enhanced intestinal regeneration following injury. Thus, the intrinsic Cdc42-MAPK program is required for intestinal epithelial regeneration, and elevating this signaling cascade is capable of initiating protection from genotoxic injury.",

        "Title": "Structural mechanism of helicase loading onto replication origin DNA by ORC-Cdc6.",
        "Abstract": "DNA replication origins serve as sites of replicative helicase loading. In all eukaryotes, the six-subunit origin recognition complex (Orc1-6; ORC) recognizes the replication origin. During late M-phase of the cell-cycle, Cdc6 binds to ORC and the ORC-Cdc6 complex loads in a multistep reaction and, with the help of Cdt1, the core Mcm2-7 helicase onto DNA. A key intermediate is the ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1-Mcm2-7 (OCCM) complex in which DNA has been already inserted into the central channel of Mcm2-7. Until now, it has been unclear how the origin DNA is guided by ORC-Cdc6 and inserted into the Mcm2-7 hexamer. Here, we truncated the C-terminal winged-helix-domain (WHD) of Mcm6 to slow down the loading reaction, thereby capturing two loading intermediates prior to DNA insertion in budding yeast. In \"semi-attached OCCM,\" the Mcm3 and Mcm7 WHDs latch onto ORC-Cdc6 while the main body of the Mcm2-7 hexamer is not connected. In \"pre-insertion OCCM,\" the main body of Mcm2-7 docks onto ORC-Cdc6, and the origin DNA is bent and positioned adjacent to the open DNA entry gate, poised for insertion, at the Mcm2-Mcm5 interface. We used molecular simulations to reveal the dynamic transition from preloading conformers to the loaded conformers in which the loading of Mcm2-7 on DNA is complete and the DNA entry gate is fully closed. Our work provides multiple molecular insights into a key event of eukaryotic DNA replication.",

In this review, we first provide a broad overview of modeling methods used for flexible fitting of molecular models into cryo-EM density maps. We give special attention to approaches rooted in molecular simulations-atomistic molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo. Concise descriptions of the methods are given along with discussion of their advantages, limitations, and most popular alternatives. We also describe recent extensions of the widely used molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) method and discuss how different model-building techniques could be incorporated into new hybrid modeling schemes and simulation workflows. Finally, we provide two illustrative examples of model-building and refinement strategies employing MDFF, cascade MDFF, and RosettaCM. These examples come from recent cryo-EM studies that elucidated transcription preinitiation complexes and shed light on the functional roles of these assemblies in gene expression and gene regulation.",

Cryo-EM advances have begun to uncover their structural organization. Nevertheless, functional analyses are hindered by incompletely modeled regions. Here we integrate all available cryo-EM data to build a practically complete human PIC structural model. This enables simulations that reveal the assembly's global motions, define PIC partitioning into dynamic communities and delineate how structural modules function together to remodel DNA. We identify key TFIIE-p62 interactions that link core-PIC to TFIIH. p62 rigging interlaces p34, p44 and XPD while capping the DNA-binding and ATP-binding sites of XPD. PIC kinks and locks substrate DNA, creating negative supercoiling within the Pol II cleft to facilitate promoter opening. Mapping disease mutations associated with xeroderma pigmentosum, trichothiodystrophy and Cockayne syndrome onto defined communities reveals clustering into three mechanistic classes that affect TFIIH helicase functions, protein interactions and interface dynamics.",

        "Abstract": "Sliding clamp proteins encircle duplex DNA and are involved in processive DNA replication and the DNA damage response. Clamp proteins are ring-shaped oligomers (dimers or trimers) and are loaded onto DNA by an ATP-dependent clamp loader complex that ruptures the interface between two adjacent subunits. Here we measured the solution dynamics of the human clamp protein, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, by monitoring the change in the fluorescence of a site-specifically labeled. To unravel the origins of clamp subunit interface stability, we carried out comprehensive comparative analysis of the interfaces of seven sliding clamps. We used computational modeling (molecular dynamic simulations and MM/GBSA binding energy decomposition analyses) to identify conserved networks of hydrophobic residues critical for clamp stability and ring-opening dynamics. The hydrophobic network is shared among clamp proteins and exhibits a \"key in a keyhole\" pattern where a bulky aromatic residue from one clamp subunit is anchored into a hydrophobic pocket of the opposing subunit. Bioinformatics and dynamic network analyses showed that this oligomeric latch is conserved across DNA sliding clamps from all domains of life and dictates the dynamics of clamp opening and closing.",

        "Abstract": "The MHC class I antigen presentation system enables T\u00a0cell immunosurveillance of cancers and viruses. A substantial fraction of the immunopeptidome derives from rapidly degraded nascent polypeptides (DRiPs). By knocking down each of the 80 ribosomal proteins, we identified proteins that modulate peptide generation without altering source protein expression. We show that 60S ribosomal proteins L6 (RPL6) and RPL28, which are adjacent on the\u00a0ribosome, play opposite roles in generating an influenza A virus-encoded peptide. Depleting RPL6 decreases ubiquitin-dependent peptide presentation, whereas depleting RPL28 increases ubiquitin-dependent and -independent peptide presentation. 40S ribosomal protein S28 (RPS28) knockdown increases total peptide supply in uninfected cells by increasing DRiP synthesis from non-canonical translation of \"untranslated\" regions and non-AUG start codons and sensitizes tumor cells for T\u00a0cell targeting. Our findings raise the possibility of modulating immunosurveillance by pharmaceutical targeting ribosomes.",

        "Abstract": "Regulation of gene-expression by specific targeting of protein-nucleic acid interactions has been a long-standing goal in medicinal chemistry. Transcription factors are considered \"undruggable\" because they lack binding sites well suited for binding small-molecules. In order to overcome this obstacle, we are interested in designing small molecules that bind to the corresponding promoter sequences and either prevent or modulate transcription factor association via an allosteric mechanism. To achieve this, we must design small molecules that are both sequence-specific and able to target G/C base pair sites. A thorough understanding of the relationship between binding affinity and the structural aspects of the small molecule-DNA complex would greatly aid in rational design of such compounds. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of sequence-specific DNA association of a synthetic minor groove binder using long timescale molecular dynamics. We show how binding selectivity arises from a combination of structural factors. Our results provide a framework for the rational design and optimization of synthetic small molecules in order to improve site-specific targeting of DNA for therapeutic uses in the design of selective DNA binders targeting transcription regulation.",

Within cells, polyamines contribute to both the efficiency and fidelity of protein synthesis. In addition to directly acting on the translation apparatus to stimulate protein synthesis, the polyamine spermidine serves as a precursor for the essential post-translational modification of the eukaryotic translation factor 5A (eIF5A), which is required for synthesis of proteins containing problematic amino acid sequence motifs, including polyproline tracts, and for termination of translation. The impact of polyamines on translation is highlighted by autoregulation of the translation of mRNAs encoding key metabolic and regulatory proteins in the polyamine biosynthesis pathway, including ",

Here, we determine the structures of Pol III pre-initiation complexes (PICs) using single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We observe stable Pol III-TFIIIB complexes using nucleic acid scaffolds mimicking various functional states, in which TFIIIB tightly encircles the upstream promoter DNA. There is an intricate interaction between TFIIIB and Pol III, which stabilizes the winged-helix domains of the C34 subunit of Pol III over the active site cleft. The architecture of Pol III PIC more resembles that of the Pol II PIC than the Pol I PIC. In addition, we also obtain a 3D reconstruction of Pol III in complex with TFIIIB using the elongation complex (EC) scaffold, shedding light on the mechanism of facilitated recycling of Pol III prior to transcription re-initiation.",

        "Abstract": "Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is a pivotal enzyme with dual roles in both genome maintenance and epigenetic regulation. TDG is involved in cytosine demethylation at CpG sites in DNA. Here we have used molecular modeling to delineate the lesion search and DNA base interrogation mechanisms of TDG. First, we examined the capacity of TDG to interrogate not only DNA substrates with 5-carboxyl cytosine modifications but also G:T mismatches and nonmismatched (A:T) base pairs using classical and accelerated molecular dynamics. To determine the kinetics, we constructed Markov state models. Base interrogation was found to be highly stochastic and proceeded through insertion of an arginine-containing loop into the DNA minor groove to transiently disrupt Watson-Crick pairing. Next, we employed chain-of-replicas path-sampling methodologies to compute minimum free energy paths for TDG base extrusion. We identified the key intermediates imparting selectivity and determined effective free energy profiles for the lesion search and base extrusion into the TDG active site. Our results show that DNA sculpting, dynamic glycosylase interactions, and stabilizing contacts collectively provide a powerful mechanism for the detection and discrimination of modified bases and epigenetic marks in DNA.",

        "Abstract": "Translation initiation is typically restricted to AUG codons, and scanning eukaryotic ribosomes inefficiently recognize near-cognate codons. We show that queuing of scanning ribosomes behind a paused elongating ribosome promotes initiation at upstream weak start sites. Ribosomal profiling reveals polyamine-dependent pausing of elongating ribosomes on a conserved Pro-Pro-Trp (PPW) motif in an inhibitory non-AUG-initiated upstream conserved coding region (uCC) of the antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) mRNA, encoding a regulator of cellular polyamine synthesis. Mutation of the PPW motif impairs initiation at the uCC's upstream near-cognate AUU start site and derepresses AZIN1 synthesis, whereas substitution of alternate elongation pause sequences restores uCC translation. Impairing ribosome loading reduces uCC translation and paradoxically derepresses AZIN1 synthesis. Finally, we identify the translation factor eIF5A as a sensor and effector for polyamine control of uCC translation. We propose that stalling of elongating ribosomes triggers queuing of scanning ribosomes and promotes initiation by positioning a ribosome near the start codon.",

        "Abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells is essential for tumorigenesis in which pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), the low activity isoform of pyruvate kinase, plays a critical role. Herein, we describe the identification of a nature-product-derived micheliolide (MCL) that selectively activates PKM2 through the covalent binding at residue cysteine424 (C424), which is not contained in PKM1. This interaction promotes more tetramer formation, inhibits the lysine433 (K433) acetylation, and influences the translocation of PKM2 into the nucleus. In addition, the pro-drug dimethylaminomicheliolide (DMAMCL) with similar properties as MCL significantly suppresses the growth of leukemia cells and tumorigenesis in a zebrafish xenograft model. Cell-based assay with knock down PKM2 expression verifies that the effects of MCL are dependent on PKM2 expression. DMAMCL is currently in clinical trials in Australia. Our discovery may provide a valuable pharmacological mechanism for clinical treatment and benefit the development of new anticancer agents.",

        "Abstract": "Cell-to-cell variation in gene expression creates a need for techniques that can characterize expression at the level of individual cells. This is particularly true for rare circulating tumour cells, in which subtyping and drug resistance are of intense interest. Here we describe a method for cell analysis-single-cell mRNA cytometry-that enables the isolation of rare cells from whole blood as a function of target mRNA sequences. This approach uses two classes of magnetic particles that are labelled to selectively hybridize with different regions of the target mRNA. Hybridization leads to the formation of large magnetic clusters that remain localized within the cells of interest, thereby enabling the cells to be magnetically separated. Targeting specific intracellular mRNAs enablescirculating tumour cells to be distinguished\u00a0from normal haematopoietic cells. No polymerase chain reaction amplification is required to determine RNA expression levels and genotype at the single-cell level, and minimal cell manipulation is required. To demonstrate this approach we use single-cell mRNA cytometry to detect clinically important sequences in prostate cancer specimens.",

        "Abstract": "The efficiency of start codon selection during ribosomal scanning in eukaryotic translation initiation is influenced by the context or flanking nucleotides surrounding the AUG codon. The levels of eukaryotic translation initiation factors 1 (eIF1) and 5 (eIF5) play critical roles in controlling the stringency of translation start site selection. The basic leucine zipper and W2 domain-containing proteins 1 and 2 (BZW1 and BZW2), also known as eIF5-mimic proteins, are paralogous human proteins containing C-terminal HEAT domains that resemble the HEAT domain of eIF5. We show that translation of mRNAs encoding BZW1 and BZW2 homologs in fungi, plants and metazoans is initiated by AUG codons in conserved unfavorable initiation contexts. This conservation is reminiscent of the conserved unfavorable initiation context that enables autoregulation of EIF1. We show that overexpression of BZW1 and BZW2 proteins enhances the stringency of start site selection, and that their poor initiation codons confer autoregulation on BZW1 and BZW2 mRNA translation. We also show that overexpression of these two proteins significantly diminishes the effect of overexpressing eIF5 on stringency of start codon selection, suggesting they antagonize this function of eIF5. These results reveal a surprising role for BZW1 and BZW2 in maintaining homeostatic stringency of start codon selection, and taking into account recent biochemical, genetic and structural insights into eukaryotic initiation, suggest a model for BZW1 and BZW2 function.",

        "Abstract": "The analysis of circulating tumour nucleic acids (ctNAs) provides a minimally invasive way to assess the mutational spectrum of a tumour. However, effective and practical methods for analyzing this emerging class of markers are lacking. Analysis of ctNAs using a sensor-based approach has notable challenges, as it is vital to differentiate nucleic acids from normal cells from mutation-bearing sequences emerging from tumours. Moreover, many genes related to cancer have dozens of different mutations. Herein, we report an electrochemical approach that directly detects genes with mutations in patient serum by using combinatorial probes (CPs). The CPs enable detection of all of the mutant alleles derived from the same part of the gene. As a proof of concept, we analyze mutations of the EGFR gene, which has more than 40 clinically relevant alterations that include deletions, insertions, and point mutations. Our CP-based approach accurately detects mutant sequences directly in patient serum.",

        "Abstract": "Although stop codon readthrough is used extensively by viruses to expand their gene expression, verified instances of mammalian readthrough have only recently been uncovered by systems biology and comparative genomics approaches. Previously, our analysis of conserved protein coding signatures that extend beyond annotated stop codons predicted stop codon readthrough of several mammalian genes, all of which have been validated experimentally. Four mRNAs display highly efficient stop codon readthrough, and these mRNAs have a UGA stop codon immediately followed by CUAG (UGA_CUAG) that is conserved throughout vertebrates. Extending on the identification of this readthrough motif, we here investigated stop codon readthrough, using tissue culture reporter assays, for all previously untested human genes containing UGA_CUAG. The readthrough efficiency of the annotated stop codon for the sequence encoding vitamin D receptor (VDR) was 6.7%. It was the highest of those tested but all showed notable levels of readthrough. The VDR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors, and it binds its major ligand, calcitriol, via its C-terminal ligand-binding domain.

        "Abstract": "Human flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) and related structure-specific 5'nucleases precisely identify and incise aberrant DNA structures during replication, repair and recombination to avoid genomic instability. Yet, it is unclear how the 5'nuclease mechanisms of DNA distortion and protein ordering robustly mediate efficient and accurate substrate recognition and catalytic selectivity. Here, single-molecule sub-millisecond and millisecond analyses of FEN1 reveal a protein-DNA induced-fit mechanism that efficiently verifies substrate and suppresses off-target cleavage. FEN1 sculpts DNA with diffusion-limited kinetics to test DNA substrate. This DNA distortion mutually 'locks' protein and DNA conformation and enables substrate verification with extreme precision. Strikingly, FEN1 never misses cleavage of its cognate substrate while blocking probable formation of catalytically competent interactions with noncognate substrates and fostering their pre-incision dissociation. These findings establish FEN1 has practically perfect precision and that separate control of induced-fit substrate recognition sets up the catalytic selectivity of the nuclease active site for genome stability.",

        "Abstract": "Specific targeting of protein\u2013nucleic acid interactions is an area of current interest, for example, in the regulation of gene-expression. Most transcription factor proteins bind in the DNA major groove; however, we are interested in an approach using small molecules to target the minor groove to control expression by an allosteric mechanism. In an effort to broaden sequence recognition of DNA-targeted-small-molecules to include both A\u00b7T and G\u00b7C base pairs, we recently discovered that the heterocyclic diamidine, DB2277, forms a strong monomer complex with a DNA sequence containing 5\u0384-AAAGTTT-3\u0384. Competition mass spectrometry and surface plasmon resonance identified new monomer complexes, as well as unexpected binding of two DB2277 with certain sequences. Inherent microstructural differences within the experimental DNAs were identified through computational analyses to understand the molecular basis for recognition. These findings emphasize the critical nature of the DNA minor groove microstructure for sequence-specific recognition and offer new avenues to design synthetic small molecules for effective regulation of gene-expression.",

        "Abstract": "Progress toward the development of minimally invasive liquid biopsies of disease is being bolstered by breakthroughs in the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA): DNA released from cancer cells into the bloodstream. However, robust, sensitive, and specific methods of detecting this emerging analyte are lacking. ctDNA analysis has unique challenges, since it is imperative to distinguish circulating DNA from normal cells vs mutation-bearing sequences originating from tumors. Here we report the electrochemical detection of mutated ctDNA in samples collected from cancer patients. By developing a strategy relying on the use of DNA clutch probes (DCPs) that render specific sequences of ctDNA accessible, we were able to readout the presence of mutated ctDNA. DCPs prevent reassociation of denatured DNA strands: they make one of the two strands of a dsDNA accessible for hybridization to a probe, and they also deactivate other closely related sequences in solution. DCPs ensure thereby that only mutated sequences associate with chip-based sensors detecting hybridization events. The assay exhibits excellent sensitivity and specificity in the detection of mutated ctDNA: it detects 1 fg/\u03bcL of a target mutation in the presence of 100 pg/\u03bcL of wild-type DNA, corresponding to detecting mutations at a level of 0.01% relative to wild type. This approach allows accurate analysis of samples collected from lung cancer and melanoma patients. This work represents the first detection of ctDNA without enzymatic amplification.",

We describe various mechanisms controlling ribosome scanning and initiation codon selection by 5' upstream open reading frames, translation initiation factors, and primary and secondary structures of the 5'UTR, including particular sequence motifs. We also discuss translational control via phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2, which is implicated in learning and memory, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Antibodies to DNA and chromatin drive autoimmunity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Null mutations and hypomorphic variants of the secreted deoxyribonuclease DNASE1L3 are linked to familial and sporadic SLE, respectively. We report that DNASE1L3-deficient mice rapidly develop autoantibodies to DNA and chromatin, followed by an SLE-like disease. Circulating DNASE1L3 is produced by dendritic cells and macrophages, and its levels inversely correlate with anti-DNA antibody response. DNASE1L3 is uniquely capable of digesting chromatin in microparticles released from apoptotic cells. Accordingly, DNASE1L3-deficient mice and human patients have elevated DNA levels in plasma, particularly in circulating microparticles. Murine and human autoantibody clones and serum antibodies from human SLE patients bind to DNASE1L3-sensitive chromatin on the surface of microparticles. Thus, extracellular microparticle-associated chromatin is a potential self-antigen normally digested by circulating DNASE1L3. The loss of this tolerance mechanism can contribute to SLE, and its restoration may represent a therapeutic opportunity in the disease.",

        "Abstract": "Hypoxic events are known to cause substantial damage to the hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum. The impact of hypoxic shock on other brain parts is not sufficiently studied. Recent studies show that tripeptidyl peptidase I (TPPI) activity in fish is altered after a hypoxic stress pointing out at a possible enzyme involvement in response to hypoxia. Similar studies are not performed in mammals. In this work, the effect of sodium nitrite-induced acute hypoxic shock on the rat brain was studied at different post-treatment periods. Morphological changes in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, thalamus, mesencephalon and pons were assessed using silver-copper impregnation for neurodegeneration. TPPI activity was biochemically assayed and localized by enzyme histochemistry. Although less vulnerable to oxidative stress, the studied brain areas showed different histopathological changes, such as neuronal loss and tissue vacuolization, dilatation of the smallest capillaries and impairment of neuronal processes. TPPI activity was strictly regulated following the hypoxic stress. It was found to increase 12-24h post-treatment, then decreased followed by a slow process of recovery. The enzyme histochemistry revealed a temporary enzyme deficiency in all types of neurons. These findings indicate a possible involvement of the enzyme in rat brain response to hypoxic stress.",

TDP2 inhibition could provide synergism with the Top2 poison class of chemotherapeutics. By virtual screening of the NCI diversity small molecule database, we identified selective TDP2 inhibitors and experimentally verified their selective inhibitory activity. Three inhibitors exhibited low-micromolar IC50 values. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed a common binding mode for these inhibitors, involving association to the TDP2 DNA-binding cleft. MM-PBSA per-residue energy decomposition identified important interactions of the compounds with specific TDP2 residues. These interactions could provide new avenues for synthetic optimization of these scaffolds.",

        "Abstract": "Abundant evidence for translation within the 5' leaders of many human genes is rapidly emerging, especially, because of the advent of ribosome profiling. In most cases, it is believed that the act of translation rather than the encoded peptide is important. However, the wealth of available sequencing data in recent years allows phylogenetic detection of sequences within 5' leaders that have emerged under coding constraint and therefore allow for the prediction of functional 5' leader translation. Using this approach, we previously predicted a CUG-initiated, 173 amino acid N-terminal extension to the human tumour suppressor PTEN. Here, a systematic experimental analysis of translation events in the PTEN 5' leader identifies at least two additional non-AUG-initiated PTEN proteoforms that are expressed in most human cell lines tested. The most abundant extended PTEN proteoform initiates at a conserved AUU codon and extends the canonical AUG-initiated PTEN by 146 amino acids. All N-terminally extended PTEN proteoforms tested retain the ability to downregulate the PI3K pathway. We also provide evidence for the translation of two conserved AUG-initiated upstream open reading frames within the PTEN 5' leader that control the ratio of PTEN proteoforms.",

        "Abstract": "Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expression is altered in various diseases and has been proposed as a drug target. Here we use a rational design approach to develop a therapeutic protein, which we call ProAgio, that binds to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 outside the classical ligand-binding site. We show ProAgio induces apoptosis of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23-expressing cells by recruiting and activating caspase 8 to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23. ProAgio also has anti-angiogenic activity and strongly inhibits growth of tumour xenografts, but does not affect the established vasculature. Toxicity analyses demonstrate that ProAgio is not toxic to mice. Our study reports a new integrin-targeting agent with a unique mechanism of action, and provides a template for the development of integrin-targeting therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "In eukaryotic transcription initiation, a large multi-subunit pre-initiation complex (PIC) that assembles at the core promoter is required for the opening of the duplex DNA and identification of the start site for transcription by RNA polymerase II. Here we use cryo-electron microscropy (cryo-EM) to determine near-atomic resolution structures of the human PIC in a closed state (engaged with duplex DNA), an open state (engaged with a transcription bubble), and an initially transcribing complex (containing six base pairs of DNA-RNA hybrid). Our studies provide structures for previously uncharacterized components of the PIC, such as TFIIE and TFIIH, and segments of TFIIA, TFIIB and TFIIF. Comparison of the different structures reveals the sequential conformational changes that accompany the transition from each state to the next throughout the transcription initiation process. This analysis illustrates the key role of TFIIB in transcription bubble stabilization and provides strong structural support for a translocase activity of XPB.",

        "Title": "Secondary Interaction Interfaces with PCNA Control Conformational Switching of DNA Polymerase PolB from Polymerization to Editing.",
        "Abstract": "Replicative DNA polymerases (Pols) frequently possess two distinct DNA processing activities: DNA synthesis (polymerization) and proofreading (3'-5' exonuclease activity). The polymerase and exonuclease reactions are performed alternately and are spatially separated in different protein domains. Thus, the growing DNA primer terminus has to undergo dynamic conformational switching between two distinct functional sites on the polymerase. Furthermore, the transition from polymerization (pol) mode to exonuclease (exo) mode must occur in the context of a DNA Pol holoenzyme, wherein the polymerase is physically associated with processivity factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and primer-template DNA. The mechanism of this conformational switching and the role that PCNA plays in it have remained obscure, largely due to the dynamic nature of ternary Pol/PCNA/DNA assemblies. Here, we present computational models of ternary assemblies for archaeal polymerase PolB. We have combined all available structural information for the binary complexes with electron microscopy data and have refined atomistic models for ternary PolB/PCNA/DNA assemblies in pol and exo modes using molecular dynamics simulations. In addition to the canonical PIP-box/interdomain connector loop (IDCL) interface of PolB with PCNA, contact analysis of the simulation trajectories revealed new secondary binding interfaces, distinct between the pol and exo states. Using targeted molecular dynamics, we explored the conformational transition from pol to exo mode. We identified a hinge region between the thumb and palm domains of PolB that is critical for conformational switching. With the thumb domain anchored onto the PCNA surface, the neighboring palm domain executed rotational motion around the hinge, bringing the core of PolB down toward PCNA to form a new interface with the clamp. A helix from PolB containing a patch of arginine residues was involved in the binding, locking the complex in the exo mode conformation. Together, these results provide a structural view of how the transition between the pol and exo states of PolB is coordinated through PCNA to achieve efficient proofreading.",

We show that binding to nGREs is a property of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) DNA-binding domain (DBD) not shared by other members of the steroid receptor family. Using phylogenetic, structural, biochemical, and molecular dynamics techniques, we show that the ancestral DBD from which GR and its paralogs evolved was capable of binding both nGRE and (+)GRE sequences because of the ancestral DBD's ability to assume multiple DNA-bound conformations. Subsequent amino acid substitutions in duplicated daughter genes selectively restricted protein conformational space, causing this dual DNA-binding specificity to be selectively enhanced in the GR lineage and lost in all others. Key substitutions that determined the receptors' response element-binding specificity were far from the proteins' DNA-binding interface and interacted epistatically to change the DBD's function through DNA-induced allosteric mechanisms. These amino acid substitutions subdivided both the conformational and functional space of the ancestral DBD among the present-day receptors, allowing a paralogous family of transcription factors to control disparate transcriptional programs despite high sequence identity.",

        "Abstract": "While conventional high-resolution techniques in structural biology are challenged by the size and flexibility of many biological assemblies, recent advances in low-resolution techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) have opened up new avenues to define the structures of such assemblies. By systematically combining various sources of structural, biochemical and biophysical information, integrative modeling approaches aim to provide a unified structural description of such assemblies, starting from high-resolution structures of the individual components and integrating all available information from low-resolution experimental methods. In this review, we describe integrative modeling approaches, which use complementary data from either cryo-EM or SAXS. Specifically, we focus on the popular molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) method, which has been widely used for flexible fitting into cryo-EM maps. Second, we describe hybrid molecular dynamics, Rosetta Monte-Carlo and minimum ensemble search (MES) methods that can be used to incorporate SAXS into pseudoatomic structural models. We present concise descriptions of the two methods and their most popular alternatives, along with select illustrative applications to protein/nucleic acid assemblies involved in DNA replication and repair.",

        "Title": "Unexpected Allosteric Network Contributes to LRH-1 Co-regulator Selectivity.",
        "Abstract": "Phospholipids (PLs) are unusual signaling hormones sensed by the nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), which has evolved a novel allosteric pathway to support appropriate interaction with co-regulators depending on ligand status. LRH-1 plays an important role in controlling lipid and cholesterol homeostasis and is a potential target for the treatment of metabolic and neoplastic diseases. Although the prospect of modulating LRH-1 via small molecules is exciting, the molecular mechanism linking PL structure to transcriptional co-regulator preference is unknown. Previous studies showed that binding to an activating PL ligand, such as dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, favors LRH-1's interaction with transcriptional co-activators to up-regulate gene expression. Both crystallographic and solution-based structural studies showed that dilauroylphosphatidylcholine binding drives unanticipated structural fluctuations outside of the canonical activation surface in an alternate activation function (AF) region, encompassing the \u03b2-sheet-H6 region of the protein. However, the mechanism by which dynamics in the alternate AF influences co-regulator selectivity remains elusive. Here, we pair x-ray crystallography with molecular modeling to identify an unexpected allosteric network that traverses the protein ligand binding pocket and links these two elements to dictate selectivity. We show that communication between the alternate AF region and classical AF2 is correlated with the strength of the co-regulator interaction. This work offers the first glimpse into the conformational dynamics that drive this unusual PL-mediated nuclear hormone receptor activation.",

        "Abstract": "Regulatory B cells (Breg) have immune suppressive functions in various autoimmune/inflammation models and diseases and are found to be enriched in diverse B cell subsets. The lack of a unique marker or set of markers efficiently identifying Breg cells impedes detailed investigation into their origin, development, and immunological roles. Here, we perform transcriptome analysis of IL-10-expressing B cells to identify key regulators for Breg biogenesis and function and identify CD9, a tetraspanin-family transmembrane protein, as a key surface marker for most mouse IL-10(+) B cells and their progenitors. CD9 plays a role in the suppressive function of IL-10(+) B cells in ex vivo T cell proliferation assays through a mechanism that is dependent upon B/T cell interactions. CD9(+) B cells also demonstrate inhibition of Th1-mediated contact hypersensitivity in an in vivo model system. Taken together, our findings implicate CD9 in the immunosuppressive activity of regulatory B cells.",

Here, we show that adhesion of microbes to intestinal epithelial cells (ECs) is a critical cue for Th17 induction. Upon monocolonization of germ-free mice or rats with SFB indigenous to mice (M-SFB) or rats (R-SFB), M-SFB and R-SFB showed host-specific adhesion to small intestinal ECs, accompanied by host-specific induction of Th17 cells. Citrobacter rodentium and Escherichia coli O157 triggered similar Th17 responses, whereas adhesion-defective mutants of these microbes failed to do so. Moreover, a mixture of 20 bacterial strains, which were selected and isolated from fecal samples of a patient with ulcerative colitis on the basis of their ability to cause a robust induction of Th17 cells in the mouse colon, also exhibited EC-adhesive characteristics.",

        "Abstract": "Generation of different CD4 T\u00a0cell responses to commensal and pathogenic bacteria is crucial for maintaining a healthy gut environment, but the associated cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. Dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (Mfs) integrate microbial signals and direct adaptive immunity. Although the role of DCs in initiating T\u00a0cell responses is well appreciated, how Mfs contribute to the generation of CD4 T\u00a0cell responses to intestinal microbes is unclear. Th17 cells are critical for mucosal immune protection and at steady state are induced by commensal bacteria, such as segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB). Here, we examined the roles of mucosal DCs and Mfs in Th17 induction by SFB in\u00a0vivo. We show that Mfs, and not conventional CD103(+) DCs, are essential for the generation of SFB-specific Th17 responses. Thus, Mfs drive mucosal T\u00a0cell responses to certain commensal bacteria.",

However, this requires differentiation between the nucleic acids that originate from healthy cells and the mutated sequences shed by tumour cells. Here we report an electrochemical clamp assay that directly detects mutated sequences in patient serum. This is the first successful detection of cfNAs without the need for enzymatic amplification, a step that normally requires extensive sample processing and is prone to interference. The new chip-based assay reads out the presence of mutations within 15 minutes using a collection of oligonucleotides that sequester closely related sequences in solution, and thus allow only the mutated sequence to bind to a chip-based sensor. We demonstrate excellent levels of sensitivity and specificity and show that the clamp assay accurately detects mutated sequences in a collection of samples taken from lung cancer and melanoma patients.",

        "Abstract": "The isolation and rapid molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from a liquid biopsy could enable the convenient and effective characterization of the state and aggressiveness of cancerous tumors. Existing technologies enumerate CTCs using immunostaining; however, these approaches are slow, labor-intensive, and often fail to enable further genetic characterization of CTCs. Here, we report on an integrated circuit that combines the capture of CTCs with the profiling of their gene expression signatures. Specifically, we use a velocity valley chip to efficiently capture magnetic nanoparticle-bound CTCs, which are then directly analyzed for their gene expression profiles using nanostructured microelectrode biosensors. CTCs are captured with 97% efficiency from 2 mL of whole blood, yielding a 500-fold concentration within 1 h. We show efficient capture of as few as 2 cancer cells/(mL of blood) and demonstrate that the gene expression module accurately profiles the expression of prostate-specific genes in CTCs captured from whole blood. This advance provides the first sample-to-answer solution for gene-based testing of CTCs. The approach was successfully validated using samples collected from prostate cancer patients: both CTCs and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA sequences were detected in all cancer patient samples and not in the healthy controls.",

        "Abstract": "Replication Protein A (RPA) is an essential scaffold for many DNA processing machines; its function relies on its modular architecture. Here, we report (15)N-nuclear magnetic resonance heteronuclear relaxation analysis to characterize the movements of single-stranded (ss) DNA binding and protein interaction modules in the RPA70 subunit. Our results provide direct evidence for coordination of the motion of the tandem RPA70AB ssDNA binding domains. Moreover, binding of ssDNA substrate is found to cause dramatic reorientation and full coupling of inter-domain motion. In contrast, the RPA70N protein interaction domain remains structurally and dynamically independent of RPA70AB regardless of binding of ssDNA. This autonomy of motion between the 70N and 70AB modules supports a model in which the two binding functions of RPA are mediated fully independently, but remain differentially coordinated depending on the length of their flexible tethers. A critical role for linkers between the globular domains in determining the functional dynamics of RPA is proposed.",

Described more than forty years ago, SFB have recently gained interest due to their unique ability to modulate the host immune system through induction of IgA and Th17 cells. Here, we describe a collection of methods to detect and quantify SFB and SFB adhesion in intestinal mucosa, as well as SFB-specific CD4 T cells in the lamina propria. In addition, we describe methods for purification of SFB from fecal material of SFB-monoassociated gnotobiotic mice. Using these methods we examine the kinetics of SFB colonization and Th17 cell induction. We also show that SFB colonize unevenly the intestinal mucosa and that SFB adherence occurs predominantly in the terminal ileum and correlates with an increased proportion of SFB-specific Th17 cells.",

        "Abstract": "Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a pivotal replication protein, which also controls cellular responses to DNA damage. Posttranslational modification of PCNA by SUMO and ubiquitin modulate these responses. How the modifiers alter PCNA-dependent DNA repair and damage tolerance pathways is largely unknown. We used hybrid methods to identify atomic models of PCNAK107-Ub and PCNAK164-SUMO consistent with small-angle X-ray scattering data of these complexes in solution. We show that SUMO and ubiquitin have distinct modes of association to PCNA. Ubiquitin adopts discrete docked binding positions. By contrast, SUMO associates by simple tethering and adopts extended flexible conformations. These structural differences are the result of the opposite electrostatic potentials of SUMO and Ub. The unexpected contrast in conformational behavior of Ub-PCNA and SUMO-PCNA has implications for interactions with partner proteins, interacting surfaces accessibility, and access points for pathway regulation.",

        "Title": "Violation of an evolutionarily conserved immunoglobulin diversity gene sequence preference promotes production of dsDNA-specific IgG antibodies.",
        "Abstract": "Variability in the developing antibody repertoire is focused on the third complementarity determining region of the H chain (CDR-H3), which lies at the center of the antigen binding site where it often plays a decisive role in antigen binding. The power of VDJ recombination and N nucleotide addition has led to the common conception that the sequence of CDR-H3 is unrestricted in its variability and random in its composition. Under this view, the immune response is solely controlled by somatic positive and negative clonal selection mechanisms that act on individual B cells to promote production of protective antibodies and prevent the production of self-reactive antibodies. This concept of a repertoire of random antigen binding sites is inconsistent with the observation that diversity (DH) gene segment sequence content by reading frame (RF) is evolutionarily conserved, creating biases in the prevalence and distribution of individual amino acids in CDR-H3. For example, arginine, which is often found in the CDR-H3 of dsDNA binding autoantibodies, is under-represented in the commonly used DH RFs rearranged by deletion, but is a frequent component of rarely used inverted RF1 (iRF1), which is rearranged by inversion. To determine the effect of altering this germline bias in DH gene segment sequence on autoantibody production, we generated mice that by genetic manipulation are forced to utilize an iRF1 sequence encoding two arginines. Over a one year period we collected serial serum samples from these unimmunized, specific pathogen-free mice and found that more than one-fifth of them contained elevated levels of dsDNA-binding IgG, but not IgM; whereas mice with a wild type DH sequence did not. Thus, germline bias against the use of arginine enriched DH sequence helps to reduce the likelihood of producing self-reactive antibodies.",

CTC capture devices developed to date isolate a bulk population of CTCs and do not differentiate subpopulations that may have varying phenotypes with different levels of clinical relevance. Here, we present a new device for CTC spatial sorting and profiling that sequesters blood-borne tumor cells with different phenotypes into discrete spatial bins. Validation data are presented showing that cancer cell lines with varying surface expression generate different binning profiles within the device. Working with patient blood samples, we obtain profiles that elucidate the heterogeneity of CTC populations present in cancer patients and also report on the status of CTCs within the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).",

        "Abstract": "Fucosylation of intestinal epithelial cells, catalyzed by fucosyltransferase 2 (Fut2), is a major glycosylation mechanism of host-microbiota symbiosis. Commensal bacteria induce epithelial fucosylation, and epithelial fucose is used as a dietary carbohydrate by many of these bacteria. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate the induction of epithelial fucosylation are unknown. Here, we show that type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) induced intestinal epithelial Fut2 expression and fucosylation in mice. This induction required the cytokines interleukin-22 and lymphotoxin in a commensal bacteria-dependent and -independent manner, respectively. Disruption of intestinal fucosylation led to increased susceptibility to infection by Salmonella typhimurium. Our data reveal a role for ILC3 in shaping the gut microenvironment through the regulation of epithelial glycosylation.",

Various electrophilic reagents such as sulfuryl chloride, bromine, benzenesulfenyl and benzeneselenenyl chlorides have been applied. The paper describes the reaction of 1-hydroxyalkyl-1,2-dienephosphonates with electrophiles that produces 2-methoxy-2-oxo-2,5-dihydro-1,2-oxaphospholes due to the participation of the phosphonate neighbouring group in the cyclization. On the other hand, (1E)-alk-1-en-1-yl phosphine oxides were prepared as mixtures with 2,5-dihydro-1,2-oxaphosphol-2-ium halides in a ratio of about 1:2 by chemo-, regio, and stereoselective electrophilic addition to the C(2)-C(3)-double bond in the allene moiety and subsequent concurrent attack of the external (halide anion) and internal (phosphine oxide group) nucleophiles. The paper proposes a possible mechanism that involves cyclization and additional reactions of the phosphorylated \u03b1-hydroxyallenes.",

        "Abstract": "Stop codon readthrough is used extensively by viruses to expand their gene expression. Until recent discoveries in Drosophila, only a very limited number of readthrough cases in chromosomal genes had been reported. Analysis of conserved protein coding signatures that extend beyond annotated stop codons identified potential stop codon readthrough of four mammalian genes. Here we use a modified targeted bioinformatic approach to identify a further three mammalian readthrough candidates. All seven genes were tested experimentally using reporter constructs transfected into HEK-293T cells. Four displayed efficient stop codon readthrough, and these have UGA immediately followed by CUAG. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that in the four readthrough candidates containing UGA-CUAG, this motif is conserved not only in mammals but throughout vertebrates with the first six of the seven nucleotides being universally conserved. The importance of the CUAG motif was confirmed using a systematic mutagenesis approach. One gene, OPRL1, encoding an opiate receptor, displayed extremely efficient levels of readthrough (\u223c31%) in HEK-293T cells. Signals both 5' and 3' of the OPRL1 stop codon contribute to this high level of readthrough. The sequence UGA-CUA alone can support 1.5% readthrough, underlying its importance.",

        "Abstract": "Alkylpurine glycosylase D (AlkD) exhibits a unique base excision strategy. Instead of interacting directly with the lesion, the enzyme engages the non-lesion DNA strand. AlkD induces flipping of the alkylated and opposing base accompanied by DNA stack compression. Since this strategy leaves the alkylated base solvent exposed, the means to achieve enzymatic cleavage had remained unclear. We determined a minimum energy path for flipping out a 3-methyl adenine by AlkD and computed a potential of mean force along this path to delineate the energetics of base extrusion. We show that AlkD acts as a scaffold to stabilize three distinct DNA conformations, including the final extruded state. These states are almost equivalent in free energy and separated by low barriers. Thus, AlkD acts by sculpting the global DNA conformation to achieve lesion expulsion from DNA. N-glycosidic bond scission is then facilitated by a backbone phosphate group proximal to the alkylated base.",

        "Abstract": "How commensal microbiota contributes to immune cell homeostasis at barrier surfaces is poorly understood. Lamina propria (LP) T helper 17 (Th17) cells participate in mucosal protection and are induced by commensal segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB). Here we show that MHCII-dependent antigen presentation of SFB antigens by intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) is crucial for Th17 cell induction. Expression of MHCII on CD11c(+) cells was necessary and sufficient for SFB-induced Th17 cell differentiation. Most SFB-induced Th17 cells recognized SFB in an MHCII-dependent manner. SFB primed and induced Th17 cells locally in the LP and Th17 cell induction occurred normally in mice lacking secondary lymphoid organs. The importance of other innate cells was unveiled by the finding that MHCII deficiency in group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) resulted in an increase in SFB-independent Th17 cell differentiation. Our results outline the complex role of DCs and ILCs in the regulation of intestinal Th17 cell homeostasis.",

Misregulation of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) has been linked to many pathological conditions. Most current PRMT inhibitors display limited specificity and selectivity, indiscriminately targeting many methyltransferase enzymes that use S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a cofactor. Here we report diamidine compounds for specific inhibition of PRMT1, the primary type I enzyme. Docking, molecular dynamics, and MM/PBSA analysis together with biochemical assays were conducted to understand the binding modes of these inhibitors and the molecular basis of selective inhibition for PRMT1. Our data suggest that 2,5-bis(4-amidinophenyl)furan (1, furamidine, DB75), one leading inhibitor, targets the enzyme active site and is primarily competitive with the substrate and noncompetitive toward the cofactor. Furthermore, cellular studies revealed that 1 is cell membrane permeable and effectively inhibits intracellular PRMT1 activity and blocks cell proliferation in leukemia cell lines with different genetic lesions.",

        "Abstract": "Proliferating cell nuclear antigen and the checkpoint clamp Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 topologically encircle DNA and act as mobile platforms in the recruitment of proteins involved in DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation. To fulfill these vital cellular functions, both clamps need to be opened and loaded onto DNA by a clamp loader complex-a process, which involves disruption of the DNA clamp's subunit interfaces. Herein, we compare the relative stabilities of the interfaces using the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann solvent accessible surface method. We identify the Rad9-Rad1 interface as the weakest and, therefore, most likely to open during clamp loading. We also delineate the dominant interface disruption pathways under external forces in multiple-trajectory steered molecular dynamics runs. We show that, similar to the case of protein folding, clamp opening may not proceed through a single interface breakdown mechanism. Instead, we identify an ensemble of opening pathways, some more prevalent than others, characterized by specific groups of contacts that differentially stabilize the regions of the interface and determine the spatial and temporal patterns of breakdown. In Rad9-Rad1-Hus1, the Rad9-Rad1 and Rad9-Hus1 interfaces share the same dominant unzipping pathway, whereas the Hus1-Rad1 interface is disrupted concertedly with no preferred directionality.",

        "Abstract": "Detailed mechanisms of DNA clamps in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems were investigated by probing their mechanics with single-molecule force spectroscopy. Specifically, the mechanical forces required for the Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae clamp opening were measured at the single-molecule level by optical tweezers. Steered molecular dynamics simulations further examined the forces involved in DNA clamp opening from the perspective of the interface binding energies associated with the clamp opening processes. In combination with additional molecular dynamics simulations, we identified the contact networks between the clamp subunits that contribute significantly to the interface stability of the S.cerevisiae and E. coli clamps. These studies provide a vivid picture of the mechanics and energy landscape of clamp opening and reveal how the prokaryotic and eukaryotic clamps function through different mechanisms.",

        "Title": "A TRPC1 protein-dependent pathway regulates osteoclast formation and function.",
        "Abstract": "Ca(2+) signaling is essential for bone homeostasis and skeletal development. Here, we show that the transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1) channel and the inhibitor of MyoD family, I-mfa, function antagonistically in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis. I-mfa null mice have an osteopenic phenotype characterized by increased osteoclast numbers and surface, which are normalized in mice lacking both Trpc1 and I-mfa. In vitro differentiation of pre-osteoclasts derived from I-mfa-deficient mice leads to an increased number of mature osteoclasts and higher bone resorption per osteoclast. These parameters return to normal levels in osteoclasts derived from double mutant mice. Consistently, whole cell currents activated in response to the depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores are larger in pre-osteoclasts derived from I-mfa knock-out mice compared with currents in wild type mice and normalized in cells derived from double mutant mice, suggesting a cell-autonomous effect of I-mfa on TRPC1 in these cells. A new splice variant of TRPC1 (TRPC1\u03b5) was identified in early pre-osteoclasts. Heterologous expression of TRPC1\u03b5 in HEK293 cells revealed that it is unique among all known TRPC1 isoforms in its ability to amplify the activity of the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel, mediating store-operated currents. TRPC1\u03b5 physically interacts with Orai1, the pore-forming subunit of the CRAC channel, and I-mfa is recruited to the TRPC1\u03b5-Orai1 complex through TRPC1\u03b5 suppressing CRAC channel activity. We propose that the positive and negative modulation of the CRAC channel by TRPC1\u03b5 and I-mfa, respectively, fine-tunes the dynamic range of the CRAC channel regulating osteoclastogenesis.",

Here we show that murine intestinal IgA plasma cells can be newly classified into two populations on the basis of CD11b expression, which cannot be discriminated by currently known criteria such as general plasma cell markers, B cell origin and T cell dependence. CD11b(+) IgA(+) plasma cells require the lymphoid structure of Peyer's patches, produce more IgA than CD11b(-) IgA(+) plasma cells, proliferate vigorously, and require microbial stimulation and IL-10 for their development and maintenance. These features allow CD11b(+) IgA(+) plasma cells to mediate early-phase antigen-specific intestinal IgA responses induced by oral immunization with protein antigen. These findings reveal the functional diversity of IgA(+) plasma cells in the murine intestine.",

        "Abstract": "In eukaryotic cells initiation may occur from near-cognate codons that differ from AUG by a single nucleotide. The stringency of start codon selection impacts the efficiency of initiation at near-cognate codons and the efficiency of initiation at AUG codons in different contexts. We used a codon-optimized firefly luciferase reporter initiated with AUG or each of the nine near-cognate codons in preferred context to examine the stringency of start codon selection in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. In vivo results indicated that the hierarchy of initiation at start codons in N. crassa (AUG \u226b CUG > GUG > ACG > AUA \u2248 UUG > AUU > AUC) is similar to that in human cells. Similar results were obtained by translating mRNAs in a homologous N. crassa in vitro translation system or in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. We next examined the efficiency of initiation at AUG, CUG, and UUG codons in different contexts in vitro. The preferred context was more important for efficient initiation from near-cognate codons than from AUG. These studies demonstrated that near-cognate codons are used for initiation in N. crassa. Such events could provide additional coding capacity or have regulatory functions. Analyses of the 5'-leader regions in the N. crassa transcriptome revealed examples of highly conserved near-cognate codons in preferred contexts that could extend the N termini of the predicted polypeptides.",

        "Abstract": "Non-coding apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA form spontaneously and as DNA base excision repair intermediates are the most common toxic and mutagenic in vivo DNA lesion. For repair, AP sites must be processed by 5' AP endonucleases in initial stages of base repair. Human APE1 and bacterial Nfo represent the two conserved 5' AP endonuclease families in the biosphere; they both recognize AP sites and incise the phosphodiester backbone 5' to the lesion, yet they lack similar structures and metal ion requirements. Here, we determined and analyzed crystal structures of a 2.4 \u00c5 resolution APE1-DNA product complex with Mg(2+) and a 0.92 \u00c5 Nfo with three metal ions. Structural and biochemical comparisons of these two evolutionarily distinct enzymes characterize key APE1 catalytic residues that are potentially functionally similar to Nfo active site components, as further tested and supported by computational analyses. We observe a magnesium-water cluster in the APE1 active site, with only Glu-96 forming the direct protein coordination to the Mg(2+). Despite differences in structure and metal requirements of APE1 and Nfo, comparison of their active site structures surprisingly reveals strong geometric conservation of the catalytic reaction, with APE1 catalytic side chains positioned analogously to Nfo metal positions, suggesting surprising functional equivalence between Nfo metal ions and APE1 residues. The finding that APE1 residues are positioned to substitute for Nfo metal ions is supported by the impact of mutations on activity. Collectively, the results illuminate the activities of residues, metal ions, and active site features for abasic site endonucleases.",

        "Abstract": "Commensal bacteria regulate the homeostasis of host effector immune cell subsets. The mechanisms involved in this commensal-host crosstalk are not well understood. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) not only create a physical barrier between the commensals and immune cells in host tissues, but also facilitate interactions between them. Perturbations of epithelial homeostasis or function lead to the development of intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and intestinal cancer. IECs receive signals from commensals and produce effector immune molecules. IECs also affect the function of immune cells in the lamina propria. Here we discuss some of these properties of IECs that define them as innate immune cells. We focus on how IECs may integrate and transmit signals from individual commensal bacteria to mucosal innate and adaptive immune cells for the establishment of the unique mucosal immunological equilibrium.",

        "Abstract": "By coupling the protection and organization of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with recruitment and alignment of DNA processing factors, replication protein A (RPA) lies at the heart of dynamic multi-protein DNA processing machinery. Nevertheless, how RPA coordinates biochemical functions of its eight domains remains unknown. We examined the structural biochemistry of RPA's DNA-binding activity, combining small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the architecture of RPA's DNA-binding core. The scattering data reveal compaction promoted by DNA binding; DNA-free RPA exists in an ensemble of states with inter-domain mobility and becomes progressively more condensed and less dynamic on binding ssDNA. Our results contrast with previous models proposing RPA initially binds ssDNA in a condensed state and becomes more extended as it fully engages the substrate. Moreover, the consensus view that RPA engages ssDNA in initial, intermediate and final stages conflicts with our data revealing that RPA undergoes two (not three) transitions as it binds ssDNA with no evidence for a discrete intermediate state. These results form a framework for understanding how RPA integrates the ssDNA substrate into DNA processing machinery, provides substrate access to its binding partners and promotes the progression and selection of DNA processing pathways.",

Harnessing the ability of microbiota to affect host immunity is considered an important therapeutic strategy for many mucosal and nonmucosal immune-related conditions, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), celiac disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and microbial infections. In addition to well-established immunostimulatory effects of the microbiota, the presence of individual mutualistic commensal bacteria with immunomodulatory effects has been described. These organisms are permanent members of the commensal microbiota and affect host immune homeostasis in specific ways. Identification of individual examples of such immunomodulatory commensals and understanding their mechanisms of interaction with the host will be invaluable in designing therapeutic strategies to reverse intestinal dysbiosis and recover immunological homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Processivity clamps such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the checkpoint sliding clamp Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 (9-1-1) act as versatile scaffolds in the coordinated recruitment of proteins involved in DNA replication, cell-cycle control, and DNA repair. Association and handoff of DNA-editing enzymes, such as flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), with sliding clamps are key processes in biology, which are incompletely understood from a mechanistic point of view. We have used an integrative computational and experimental approach to define the assemblies of FEN1 with double-flap DNA substrates and either proliferating cell nuclear antigen or the checkpoint sliding clamp 9-1-1. Fully atomistic models of these two ternary complexes were developed and refined through extensive molecular dynamics simulations to expose their conformational dynamics. Clustering analysis revealed the most dominant conformations accessible to the complexes. The cluster centroids were subsequently used in conjunction with single-particle electron microscopy data to obtain a 3D EM reconstruction of the human 9-1-1/FEN1/DNA assembly at 18-\u00c5 resolution. Comparing the structures of the complexes revealed key differences in the orientation and interactions of FEN1 and double-flap DNA with the two clamps that are consistent with their respective functions in providing inherent flexibility for lagging strand DNA replication or inherent stability for DNA repair.",

        "Abstract": "Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) was studied in three human lung cells - P (fetal lung-derived cells), A549 (lung adenocarcinoma) and SK-MES-1 (squamous cell carcinoma) using a fluorescent cytochemical procedure developed on the basis of the substrate 4-(glycyl-L-prolyl hydrazido)-N-hexyl-1,8-naphthalimide. The observed differences in the enzyme expression were confirmed by measuring the enzyme hydrolysis of glycyl-L-prolyl-para-nitroanilide. The surface and total dipeptidyl peptidase activities of P cells were correspondingly 7-8 and 3-10 times higher than those of SK-MES-1 and A549 cells. The ratio surface per total activity showed that in P (95%) and A549 (93%) cells the enzyme is associated with the plasmalemma while in SK-MES-1 cells (35%) it is bound to intracellular membranes. In order to compare the results from cell cultures with those in human tumor, the enzyme activity was investigated in cryo-sections of three cases of diagnosed squamous lung carcinoma. DPPIV activity was restricted to the connective tissue stroma surrounding the DPPIV-negative tumor foci.",

        "Title": "Acquisition of a multifunctional IgA+ plasma cell phenotype in the gut.",
        "Abstract": "The largest mucosal surface in the body is in the gastrointestinal tract, a location that is heavily colonized by microbes that are normally harmless. A key mechanism required for maintaining a homeostatic balance between this microbial burden and the lymphocytes that densely populate the gastrointestinal tract is the production and transepithelial transport of poly-reactive IgA (ref. 1). Within the mucosal tissues, B cells respond to cytokines, sometimes in the absence of T-cell help, undergo class switch recombination of their immunoglobulin receptor to IgA, and differentiate to become plasma cells. However, IgA-secreting plasma cells probably have additional attributes that are needed for coping with the tremendous bacterial load in the gastrointestinal tract. Here we report that mouse IgA(+) plasma cells also produce the antimicrobial mediators tumour-necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and express many molecules that are commonly associated with monocyte/granulocytic cell types. The development of iNOS-producing IgA(+) plasma cells can be recapitulated in vitro in the presence of gut stroma, and the acquisition of this multifunctional phenotype in vivo and in vitro relies on microbial co-stimulation. Deletion of TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS in B-lineage cells resulted in a reduction in IgA production, altered diversification of the gut microbiota and poor clearance of a gut-tropic pathogen. These findings reveal a novel adaptation to maintaining homeostasis in the gut, and extend the repertoire of protective responses exhibited by some B-lineage cells.",

        "Abstract": "An AUG in an optimal nucleotide context is the preferred translation initiation site in eukaryotic cells. Interactions among translation initiation factors, including eIF1 and eIF5, govern start codon selection. Experiments described here showed that high intracellular eIF5 levels reduced the stringency of start codon selection in human cells. In contrast, high intracellular eIF1 levels increased stringency. High levels of eIF5 induced translation of inhibitory upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in eIF5 mRNA that initiate with AUG codons in conserved poor contexts. This resulted in reduced translation from the downstream eIF5 start codon, indicating that eIF5 autoregulates its own synthesis. As with eIF1, which is also autoregulated through translation initiation, features contributing to eIF5 autoregulation show deep evolutionary conservation. The results obtained provide the basis for a model in which auto- and cross-regulation of eIF5 and eIF1 translation establish a regulatory feedback loop that would stabilize the stringency of start codon selection.",

        "Abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) in tissues and lymphoid organs comprise distinct functional subsets that differentiate in situ from circulating progenitors. Tissue-specific signals that regulate DC subset differentiation are poorly understood. We report that DC-specific deletion of the Notch2 receptor caused a reduction of DC populations in the spleen. Within the splenic CD11b(+) DC subset, Notch signaling blockade ablated a distinct population marked by high expression of the adhesion molecule Esam. The Notch-dependent Esam(hi) DC subset required lymphotoxin beta receptor signaling, proliferated in situ, and facilitated CD4(+) T cell priming. The Notch-independent Esam(lo) DCs expressed monocyte-related genes and showed superior cytokine responses. In addition, Notch2 deletion led to the loss of CD11b(+)CD103(+) DCs in the intestinal lamina propria and to a corresponding decrease of IL-17-producing CD4(+) T cells in the intestine. Thus, Notch2 is a common differentiation signal for T cell-priming CD11b(+) DC subsets in the spleen and intestine.",

        "Title": "Solution X-ray scattering combined with computational modeling reveals multiple conformations of covalently bound ubiquitin on PCNA.",
        "Abstract": "PCNA ubiquitination in response to DNA damage leads to the recruitment of specialized translesion polymerases to the damage locus. This constitutes one of the initial steps in translesion synthesis (TLS)--a critical pathway for cell survival and for maintenance of genome stability. The recent crystal structure of ubiquitinated PCNA (Ub-PCNA) sheds light on the mode of association between the two proteins but also revealed that paradoxically, the ubiquitin surface engaged in PCNA interactions was the same as the surface implicated in translesion polymerase binding. This finding implied a degree of flexibility inherent in the Ub-PCNA complex that would allow it to transition into a conformation competent to bind the TLS polymerase. To address the issue of segmental flexibility, we combined multiscale computational modeling and small angle X-ray scattering. This combined strategy revealed alternative positions for ubiquitin to reside on the surface of the PCNA homotrimer, distinct from the position identified in the crystal structure. Two mutations originally identified in genetic screens and known to interfere with TLS are positioned directly beneath the bound ubiquitin in the alternative models. These computationally derived positions, in an ensemble with the crystallographic and flexible positions, provided the best fit to the solution scattering, indicating that ubiquitin dynamically associated with PCNA and is capable of transitioning between a few discrete sites on the PCNA surface. The finding of new docking sites and the positional equilibrium of PCNA-Ub occurring in solution provide unexpected insight into previously unexplained biological observations.",

        "Title": "Developmental study of tripeptidyl peptidase I activity in the mouse central nervous system and peripheral organs.",
        "Abstract": "Tripeptidyl peptidase I (TPPI) - a lysosomal serine protease - is encoded by the CLN2 gene, mutations that cause late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL) connected with profound neuronal loss, severe clinical symptoms and early death at puberty. Developmental studies of TPPI activity levels and distribution have been done in the human and rat central nervous systems (CNS) and visceral organs. Similar studies have not been performed in mouse. In this paper, we follow up on the developmental changes in the enzyme activity and localization pattern in the CNS and visceral organs of mouse over the main periods of life - embryonic, neonate, suckling, infantile, juvenile, adult and aged - using biochemical assays and enzyme histochemistry. In the studied peripheral organs (liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas and lung) TPPI is present at birth but further its pattern is not consistent in different organs over different life periods. TPPI activity starts to be expressed in the brain at the 10th embryonic day but in most neuronal types it appears at the early infantile period, increases during infancy, reaches high activity levels in the juvenile period and is highest in adult and aged animals. Thus, in mice TPPI activity becomes crucial for the neuronal functions later in development (juvenile period) than in humans and does not decrease with aging. These results are essential as a basis for comparison between normal and pathological TPPI patterns in mice. They can be valuable in view of the use of animal models for studying LINCL and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Absorption and fluorescence spectra in acetonitrile for a series of substituted aryl hydrazones of N-hexyl-1,8-naphthalimide are studied with the aim of potential application of the compounds for enzyme activity localization. The influence of the substituents on the spectral characteristics has been evaluated. The absorption and fluorescence energies of substituted aryl-1,8-naphthalimide hydrazones have been calculated with the PCM TDDFT formalism. The M06 and PBE0 functionals, combined with the 6-31+G(d) atomic basis set, have been found to accurately model the excited state properties of the present set of solvated fluorophores. Absorption and fluorescence spectral characteristics have been rationalized in terms of experimental and theoretical electronic indices in order to assess their predictive abilities for application in designing analogues with good emitting properties. An excellent linear dependence is established between the experimental fluorescence and Hammett \u03c3(p)(+) substituent constants and on the other hand \u03c3(p)(+) constants correlate with the theoretically calculated values for the electrostatic potential at nuclei (EPN). A model for predicting the fluorescence properties of substituted hydrazones by means of EPN is drawn, including the polysubstituted derivatives, where Hammett constants are not applicable.",

        "Abstract": "Perturbations of the composition of the symbiotic intestinal microbiota can have profound consequences for host metabolism and immunity. In mice, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) direct the accumulation of potentially proinflammatory Th17 cells in the intestinal lamina propria. We present the genome sequence of SFB isolated from monocolonized mice, which classifies SFB phylogenetically as a unique member of Clostridiales with a highly reduced genome. Annotation analysis demonstrates that SFB depend on their environment for amino acids and essential nutrients and may utilize host and dietary glycans for carbon, nitrogen, and energy. Comparative analyses reveal that SFB are functionally related to members of the genus Clostridium and several pathogenic or commensal \"minimal\" genera, including Finegoldia, Mycoplasma, Borrelia, and Phytoplasma. However, SFB are functionally distinct from all 1200 examined genomes, indicating a gene complement representing biology relatively unique to their role as a gut commensal closely tied to host metabolism and immunity.",

        "Abstract": "The programmed, stepwise acquisition of immunocompetence that marks the development of the fetal immune response proceeds during a period when both T cell receptor and immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoires exhibit reduced junctional diversity due to physiologic terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) insufficiency. To test the effect of N addition on humoral responses, we transplanted bone marrow from TdT-deficient (TdT(-/-)) and wild-type (TdT(+/+)) BALB/c mice into recombination activation gene 1-deficient BALB/c hosts. Mice transplanted with TdT(-/-) cells exhibited diminished humoral responses to the T-independent antigens \u03b1-1-dextran and (2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) hapten conjugated to AminoEthylCarboxymethyl-FICOLL, to the T-dependent antigens NP(19)CGG and hen egg lysozyme, and to Enterobacter cloacae, a commensal bacteria that can become an opportunistic pathogen in immature and immunocompromised hosts. An exception to this pattern of reduction was the T-independent anti-phosphorylcholine response to Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is normally dominated by the N-deficient T15 idiotype. Most of the humoral immune responses in the recipients of TdT(-/-) bone marrow were impaired, yet population of the blood with B and T cells occurred more rapidly. To further test the effect of N-deficiency on B cell and T cell population growth, transplanted TdT-sufficient and -deficient BALB/c IgM(a) and congenic TdT-sufficient CB17 IgM(b) bone marrow were placed in competition. TdT(-/-) cells demonstrated an advantage in populating the bone marrow, the spleen, and the peritoneal cavity. TdT deficiency, which characterizes fetal lymphocytes, thus appears to facilitate filling both central and peripheral lymphoid compartments, but at the cost of altered responses to a broad set of antigens.",

        "Title": "Histone H4 acetylation differentially modulates arginine methylation by an in Cis mechanism.",
        "Abstract": "Histone H4 undergoes extensive post-translational modifications (PTMs) at its N-terminal tail. Many of these PTMs profoundly affect the on and off status of gene transcription. The molecular mechanism by which histone PTMs modulate genetic and epigenetic processes is not fully understood. In particular, how a PTM mark affects the presence and level of other histone modification marks needs to be addressed and is essential for better understanding the molecular basis of histone code hypothesis. To dissect the interplaying relationship between different histone modification marks, we investigated how individual lysine acetylations and their different combinations at the H4 tail affect Arg-3 methylation in cis. Our data reveal that the effect of lysine acetylation on arginine methylation depends on the site of acetylation and the type of methylation. Although certain acetylations present a repressive impact on PRMT1-mediated methylation (type I methylation), lysine acetylation generally is correlated with enhanced methylation by PRMT5 (type II dimethylation). In particular, Lys-5 acetylation decreases the activity of PRMT1 but increases that of PRMT5. Furthermore, circular dichroism study and computer simulation demonstrate that hyperacetylation increases the content of ordered secondary structures at the H4 tail region. These findings provide new insights into the regulatory mechanism of Arg-3 methylation by H4 acetylation and unravel the complex intercommunications that exist between different the PTM marks in cis. The divergent activities of PRMT1 and PRMT5 with respect to different acetyl-H4 substrates suggest that type I and type II protein-arginine methyltransferases use distinct molecular determinants for substrate recognition and catalysis.",

        "Abstract": "Viral tropism is the ability of viruses to enter and infect specific host cells and is based on the ability of viruses to bind to receptors on those cells. Testing for HIV tropism is recommended before prescribing a chemokine receptor blocker. In most European countries, HIV tropism is identified with tropism phenotype testing. New data support genotype analysis of the HIV third hypervariable loop (V3) for the identification of tropism. The European Consensus Group on clinical management of tropism testing was established to make recommendations to clinicians and clinical virologists. The panel recommends HIV-tropism testing for the following groups: drug-naive patients in whom toxic effects are anticipated or for whom few treatment options are available; patients who have poor tolerability to or toxic effects from current treatment or who have CNS pathology; and patients for whom therapy has failed and a change in treatment is considered. In general, an enhanced sensitivity Trofile assay and V3 population genotyping are the recommended methods. Genotypic methods are anticipated to be used more frequently in the clinical setting because of their greater accessibility, lower cost, and faster turnaround time than other methods. For the interpretation of V3 loop genotyping, clinically validated systems should be used when possible. Laboratories doing HIV tropism tests should have adequate quality assurance measures. Similarly, close collaboration between HIV clinicians and virologists is needed to ensure adequate diagnostic and treatment decisions.",

        "Abstract": "GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are ligand gated chloride ion channels that mediate overall inhibitory signaling in the CNS. A detailed understanding of their structure is important to gain insights in, e.g., ligand binding and functional properties of this pharmaceutically important target. Homology modeling is a necessary tool in this regard because experimentally determined structures are lacking. Here we present an exhaustive approach for creating a high quality model of the \u03b1(1)\u03b2(2)\u03b3(2) subtype of the GABA(A)R ligand binding domain, and we demonstrate its usefulness in understanding details of orthosteric ligand binding. The model was constructed by using multiple templates and by incorporation of knowledge from biochemical/pharmacological experiments. It was validated on the basis of objective energy functions, its ability to account for available residue specific information, and its stability in molecular dynamics (MD) compared with that of the two homologous crystal structures. We then combined the model with extensive structure-activity relationships available from two homologous series of orthosteric GABA(A)R antagonists to create a detailed hypothesis for their binding modes. Excellent agreement with key experimental data was found, including the ability of the model to accommodate and explain a previously developed pharmacophore model. A coupling to agonist binding was thereby established and discussed in relation to activation mechanisms. Our results highlight the importance of critical evaluation and optimization of each step in the homology modeling process. The approach taken here can greatly aid in increasing the understanding of GABA(A)Rs and related receptors where structural insight is limited and reliable models are difficult to obtain.",

        "Abstract": "In eukaryotes, it is generally assumed that translation initiation occurs at the AUG codon closest to the messenger RNA 5' cap. However, in certain cases, initiation can occur at codons differing from AUG by a single nucleotide, especially the codons CUG, UUG, GUG, ACG, AUA and AUU. While non-AUG initiation has been experimentally verified for a handful of human genes, the full extent to which this phenomenon is utilized--both for increased coding capacity and potentially also for novel regulatory mechanisms--remains unclear. To address this issue, and hence to improve the quality of existing coding sequence annotations, we developed a methodology based on phylogenetic analysis of predicted 5' untranslated regions from orthologous genes. We use evolutionary signatures of protein-coding sequences as an indicator of translation initiation upstream of annotated coding sequences. Our search identified novel conserved potential non-AUG-initiated N-terminal extensions in 42 human genes including VANGL2, FGFR1, KCNN4, TRPV6, HDGF, CITED2, EIF4G3 and NTF3, and also affirmed the conservation of known non-AUG-initiated extensions in 17 other genes. In several instances, we have been able to obtain independent experimental evidence of the expression of non-AUG-initiated products from the previously published literature and ribosome profiling data.",

        "Abstract": "The proton-gated ion channel from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC) is a prokaryotic homolog of the eukaryotic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that responds to the binding of neurotransmitter acetylcholine and mediates fast signal transmission. Recent emergence of a high-resolution crystal structure of GLIC captured in a potentially open state allowed detailed, atomic-level insight into ion conduction and selectivity mechanisms in these channels. Herein, we have examined the barriers to ion conduction and origins of ion selectivity in the GLIC channel by the construction of potential-of-mean-force profiles for sodium and chloride ions inside the transmembrane region. Our calculations reveal that the GLIC channel is open for a sodium ion to transport, but presents a \u223c11 kcal/mol free energy barrier for a chloride ion. Our collective findings identify three distinct contributions to the observed preference for the permeant ions. First, there is a substantial contribution due to a ring of negatively charged glutamate residues (E-2') at the narrow intracellular end of the channel. The negative electrostatics of this region and the ability of the glutamate side chains to directly bind cations would strongly favor the passage of sodium ions while hindering translocation of chloride ions. Second, our results imply a significant hydrophobic contribution to selectivity linked to differences in the desolvation penalty for the sodium versus chloride ions in the central hydrophobic region of the pore. This hydrophobic contribution is evidenced by the large free energy barriers experienced by Cl\u207b in the middle of the pore for both GLIC and the E-2'A mutant. Finally, there is a distinct contribution arising from the overall negative electrostatics of the channel.",

        "Abstract": "Intestinal bacteria form a resident community that has co-evolved with the mammalian host. In addition to playing important roles in digestion and harvesting energy, commensal bacteria are crucial for the proper functioning of mucosal immune defenses. Most of these functions have been attributed to the presence of large numbers of 'innocuous' resident bacteria that dilute or occupy niches for intestinal pathogens or induce innate immune responses that sequester bacteria in the lumen, thus quenching excessive activation of the mucosal immune system. However it has recently become obvious that commensal bacteria are not simply beneficial bystanders, but are important modulators of intestinal immune homeostasis and that the composition of the microbiota is a major factor in pre-determining the type and robustness of mucosal immune responses. Here we review specific examples of individual members of the microbiota that modify innate and adaptive immune responses, and we focus on potential mechanisms by which such species-specific signals are generated and transmitted to the host immune system.",

        "Abstract": "Compared with adult bone marrow (BM), the composition of the perinatal liver CDR-3 of the Ig H chain (CDR-H3) repertoire is marked by a paucity of N nucleotides and by enrichment for use of J(H) proximal DQ52 and D(H) proximal V(H) and J(H) gene segments. To test the extent to which these differences reflect limited perinatal TdT activity versus differences in the fetal/adult environment, we used the Hardy scheme to sort fractions B-F B lineage cells from TdT-deficient BALB/c adult BM. V(H)7183-containing VDJC\u03bc transcripts from these cells were amplified, cloned, sequenced, and compared with transcripts from wild-type perinatal liver and adult BM. The pattern of V(H)DJ(H) usage in TdT-deficient BM largely matched that of TdT-sufficient adult cells. What minor differences were detected in the pro-B cell stage tended to diminish with B cell maturation, suggesting strong environmental or Ag-driven pressure to achieve a specific range of V(H)DJ(H) usage regardless of the extent of N nucleotide addition. However, although the patterns of V(H)DJ(H) usage in the TdT-deficient B lineage cells paralleled that of wild-type adult cells, the length distribution, global amino acid composition, and charge distribution of the CDR-H3 repertoire proved to be a close, although not exact, homologue of the CDR-H3 repertoire first expressed by late pre-B cells in the TdT-insufficient perinatal liver. Thus, although differing in V(H) content, TdT-deficient mice appear to represent a good, although not perfect, model for testing the role of perinatal CDR-H3 limitations on late B cell development and Ab responses.",

        "Abstract": "The central feature of standard eukaryotic translation initiation is small ribosome subunit loading at the 5' cap followed by its 5' to 3' scanning for a start codon. The preferred start is an AUG codon in an optimal context. Elaborate cellular machinery exists to ensure the fidelity of start codon selection. Eukaryotic initiation factor 1 (eIF1) plays a central role in this process. Here we show that the translation of eIF1 homologs in eukaryotes from diverse taxa involves initiation from an AUG codon in a poor context. Using human eIF1 as a model, we show that this poor context is necessary for an autoregulatory negative feedback loop in which a high level of eIF1 inhibits its own translation, establishing that variability in the stringency of start codon selection is used for gene regulation in eukaryotes. We show that the stringency of start codon selection (preferential utilization of optimal start sites) is increased to a surprising degree by overexpressing eIF1. The capacity for the cellular level of eIF1 to impact initiation through the variable stringency of initiation codon selection likely has significant consequences for the proteome in eukaryotes.",

        "Title": "Sequence requirements for ribosome stalling by the arginine attenuator peptide.",
        "Abstract": "The 5' regions of eukaryotic mRNAs often contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs). The Neurospora crassa arg-2 uORF encodes the 24-residue arginine attenuator peptide (AAP). This regulatory uORF-encoded peptide, which is evolutionarily conserved in fungal transcripts specifying an arginine biosynthetic enzyme, functions as a nascent peptide within the ribosomal tunnel and negatively regulates gene expression. The nascent AAP causes ribosomes to stall at the uORF stop codon in response to arginine, thus, blocking ribosomes from reaching the ARG-2 initiation codon. Here scanning mutagenesis with alanine and proline was performed to systematically determine which AAP residues were important for conferring regulation. Changing many of the most highly conserved residues (Asp-12, Tyr-13, Lys-14, and Trp-19) abolished regulatory function. The minimal functional domain of the AAP was determined by positioning AAP sequences internally within a large polypeptide. Pulse-chase analyses revealed that residues 9-20 of the AAP composed the minimal domain that was sufficient to confer regulatory function. An extensive analysis of predicted fungal AAPs revealed that the minimal functional domain of the N. crassa AAP corresponded closely to the region that was most highly conserved among the fungi. We also observed that the tripeptide RGD could function similarly to arginine in triggering AAP-mediated ribosome stalling. These studies provide a better understanding of the elements required for a nascent peptide and a small regulatory molecule to control translational processes.",

        "Abstract": "Commensal microbes can have a substantial impact on autoimmune disorders, but the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain largely unexplored. We report that autoimmune arthritis was strongly attenuated in the K/BxN mouse model under germ-free (GF) conditions, accompanied by reductions in serum autoantibody titers, splenic autoantibody-secreting cells, germinal centers, and the splenic T helper 17 (Th17) cell population. Neutralization of interleukin-17 prevented arthritis development in specific-pathogen-free K/BxN mice resulting from a direct effect of this cytokine on B cells to inhibit germinal center formation. The systemic deficiencies of the GF animals reflected a loss of Th17 cells from the small intestinal lamina propria. Introduction of a single gut-residing species, segmented filamentous bacteria, into GF animals reinstated the lamina propria Th17 cell compartment and production of autoantibodies, and arthritis rapidly ensued. Thus, a single commensal microbe, via its ability to promote a specific Th cell subset, can drive an autoimmune disease.",

        "Abstract": "Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, sliding clamp) is a toroidal-shaped protein that encircles DNA and plays a pivotal role in DNA replication, modification and repair. To perform its vital functions, the clamp has to be opened and resealed at primer-template junctions by a clamp loader molecular machine, replication factor C (RFC). The mechanism of this process constitutes a significant piece in the puzzle of processive DNA replication. We show that upon clamp opening the RFC/PCNA complex undergoes a large conformational rearrangement, leading to the formation of an extended interface between the clamp and RFC. Binding of ring-open PCNA to all five RFC subunits transforms the free-energy landscape underlying the closed- to open state transition, trapping PCNA in an open conformation. Careful comparison of free-energy profiles for clamp opening in the presence and absence of RFC allowed us to substantiate the role of RFC in the initial stage of the clamp-loading cycle. RFC does not appreciably destabilize the closed state of PCNA. Instead, the function of the clamp loader is dependent on the selective stabilization of the open conformation of the clamp.",

        "Title": "Innate lymphoid cells drive interleukin-23-dependent innate intestinal pathology.",
        "Abstract": "The key role of interleukin (IL)-23 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders is supported by the identification of IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) susceptibility alleles associated with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. IL-23-driven inflammation has primarily been linked to the actions of T-helper type 17 (TH17) cells. Somewhat overlooked, IL-23 also has inflammatory effects on innate immune cells and can drive T-cell-independent colitis. However, the downstream cellular and molecular pathways involved in this innate intestinal inflammatory response are poorly characterized. Here we show that bacteria-driven innate colitis is associated with an increased production of IL-17 and interferon-gamma in the colon. Stimulation of colonic leukocytes with IL-23 induced the production of IL-17 and interferon-gamma exclusively by innate lymphoid cells expressing Thy1, stem cell antigen 1 (SCA-1), retinoic-acid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-gammat and IL-23R, and these cells markedly accumulated in the inflamed colon. IL-23-responsive innate intestinal cells are also a feature of T-cell-dependent models of colitis. The transcription factor ROR-gammat, which controls IL-23R expression, has a functional role, because Rag-/-Rorc-/- mice failed to develop innate colitis. Last, depletion of Thy1+ innate lymphoid cells completely abrogated acute and chronic innate colitis. These results identify a previously unrecognized IL-23-responsive innate lymphoid population that mediates intestinal immune pathology and may therefore represent a target in inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "Abstract": "Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) catalyzes the first and rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of polyamines in most eukaryotes. Because polyamines have pleiotropic and often dramatic effects on cellular processes at both high and low concentrations, ODC expression is tightly controlled. ODC is regulated by a family of polyamine-induced proteins, antizymes, which bind to, and inactivate it. In mammals, and apparently most vertebrates, antizymes are in turn antagonized by proteins called antizyme inhibitors. Antizyme inhibitors are homologs of ODC that have lost their decarboxylation activity but have retained their ability to bind antizyme, in most cases even more tightly than ODC. We present a phylogenetic analysis of over 200 eukaryotic homologs of ODC and evaluate their potential to be either true ODCs or catalytically inactive proteins that might be analogs of the previously identified antizyme inhibitors. This analysis yielded several orthologous groups of putative novel antizyme inhibitors each apparently arising independently. In the process we also identify previously unrecognized ODC paralogs in several evolutionary branches, including a previously unrecognized ODC paralog in mammals, and we evaluate their biochemical potential based on their pattern of amino acid conservation.",

Upstream ORFs are functionally diverse as illustrated by their variety of features in polyamine pathway biosynthetic mRNAs.

The uORF-mediated polyamine responsive autoregulatory circuits found in polyamine pathway mRNAs exemplify the translationally regulated dynamic interface between components of the proteome and metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "The gastrointestinal tract of mammals is inhabited by hundreds of distinct species of commensal microorganisms that exist in a mutualistic relationship with the host. How commensal microbiota influence the host immune system is poorly understood. We show here that colonization of the small intestine of mice with a single commensal microbe, segmented filamentous bacterium (SFB), is sufficient to induce the appearance of CD4(+) T helper cells that produce IL-17 and IL-22 (Th17 cells) in the lamina propria. SFB adhere tightly to the surface of epithelial cells in the terminal ileum of mice with Th17 cells but are absent from mice that have few Th17 cells. Colonization with SFB was correlated with increased expression of genes associated with inflammation and antimicrobial defenses and resulted in enhanced resistance to the intestinal pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Thus, manipulation of this commensal-regulated pathway may provide new opportunities for enhancing mucosal immunity and treating autoimmune disease.",

        "Abstract": "The specificity of 10 recombinant caspases was investigated using a set of competitive substrates. The caspase activity was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography using highly fluorescent peptides containing 2-aminoacridone (AMAC) as reporting group. The sequences of the used substrates were designed according to literature data for being specific for 10 of the caspases. The described approach allows the concentration changes of several substrates to be monitored simultaneously in a single sample. Because the substrates are in competitive conditions, the preferences of particular caspases to given peptide sequences are most clearly demonstrated. In the studied competitive assay conditions, all tested caspases except caspase 2 exhibit activity toward more than one substrate. None of the used peptide sequences was found to be highly specific for a defined caspase. The results obtained indicate that there is well-expressed group specificity among the caspases.",

        "Title": "Molecular-dynamics simulations of ELIC-a prokaryotic homologue of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.",
        "Abstract": "The ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) is a prokaryotic homolog of the eukaryotic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) that responds to the binding of neurotransmitter acetylcholine and mediates fast signal transmission. ELIC is similar to the nAChR in its primary sequence and overall subunit organization, but despite their structural similarity, it is not clear whether these two ligand-gated ion channels operate in a similar manner. Further, it is not known to what extent mechanistic insights gleaned from the ELIC structure translate to eukaryotic counterparts such as the nAChR. Here we use molecular-dynamics simulations to probe the conformational dynamics and hydration of the transmembrane pore of ELIC. The results are compared with those from our previous simulation of the human alpha7 nAChR. Overall, ELIC displays increased stability compared to the nAChR, whereas the two proteins exhibit remarkable similarity in their global motion and flexibility patterns. The majority of the increased stability of ELIC does not stem from the deficiency of the models used in the simulations, and but rather seems to have a structural basis. Slightly altered dynamical correlation features are also observed among several loops within the membrane region. In sharp contrast to the nAChR, ELIC is completely dehydrated from the pore center to the extracellular end throughout the simulation. Finally, the simulation of an ELIC mutant substantiates the important role of F246 on the stability, hydration and possibly function of the ELIC channel.",

        "Title": "Do N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases indeed have a single amino acid catalytic center?",
        "Abstract": "A new set of experimental kinetic data on the hydrolysis of a series of phenylacetyl p-substituted anilides catalyzed by penicillin G acylase from Escherichia coli (PGA) is presented in this article. The Hammett plot of log(k(cat,R)/k(cat,H)) versus sigma(p) (-) has three linear segments, which distinguishes the enzyme from the other N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases for which data are available. Three amino acids in the vicinity of the catalytic SerB1 (AsnB241, AlaB69, and GlnB23) were included in the quantum mechanical model. The stable structures and the transition states for acylation were optimized by molecular mechanical modeling and at the AM1 level of theory for three model substrates (with H, a methoxy group or a nitro group in the para position in the leaving group). Intrinsic interactions of several functional groups at the active site of PGA are discussed in relation to the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. The energy barrier computed for the first step of acylation (the nucleophilic attack of SerB1) is lower than that for the second step (the collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate). However, the electronic properties of the substituent on the leaving group affect the structure of the second transition state. It is shown that the main chain carbonyl group of GlnB23 forms a hydrogen bond with the leaving group nitrogen, thus influencing the hydrolysis rate. On the basis of our computations, we propose an interpretation of the complex character of the Hammett plot for the reaction catalyzed by PGA. We suggest a modified scheme of the catalytic mechanism in which some of the intramolecular interactions essential for catalysis are included.",

        "Abstract": "The comparative dynamics and inhibitor binding free energies of group-1 and group-2 pathogenic influenza A subtype neuraminidase (NA) enzymes are of fundamental biological interest and relevant to structure-based drug design studies for antiviral compounds. In this work, we present seven generalized Born molecular dynamics simulations of avian (N1)- and human (N9)-type NAs in order to probe the comparative flexibility of the two subtypes, both with and without the inhibitor oseltamivir bound. The enhanced sampling obtained through the implicit solvent treatment suggests several provocative insights into the dynamics of the two subtypes, including that the group-2 enzymes may exhibit similar motion in the 430-binding site regions but different 150-loop motion. End-point free energy calculations elucidate the contributions to inhibitor binding free energies and suggest that entropic considerations cannot be neglected when comparing across the subtypes. We anticipate the findings presented here will have broad implications for the development of novel antiviral compounds against both seasonal and pandemic influenza strains.",

        "Title": "Lymphoid tissue inducer-like cells are an innate source of IL-17 and IL-22.",
        "Abstract": "The interleukin (IL) 17 family of cytokines has emerged to be critical for host defense as well as the pathogenesis of autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders, and serves to link adaptive and innate responses. Recent studies have identified a new subset of T cells that selectively produce IL-17 (Th17 cells; Bettelli, E., T. Korn, and V.K. Kuchroo. 2007. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 19:652-657; Kolls, J.K., and A. Linden. 2004. Immunity. 21:467-476), but the regulation of IL-17 production by innate immune cells is less well understood. We report that in vitro stimulation with IL-23 induced IL-17 production by recombination activating gene (Rag) 2(-/-) splenocytes but not Rag2(-/-) common gamma chain(-/-) splenocytes. We found that a major source of IL-17 was CD4(+)CD3(-)NK1.1(-)CD11b(-)Gr1(-)CD11c(-)B220(-) cells, a phenotype that corresponds to lymphoid tissue inducer-like cells (LTi-like cells), which constitutively expressed the IL-23 receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and CCR6. In vivo challenge with the yeast cell wall product zymosan rapidly induced IL-17 production in these cells. Genetic deletion of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 reduced but did not abrogate IL-17 production in LTi-like cells. Thus, it appears that splenic LTi-like cells are a rapid source of IL-17 and IL-22, which might contribute to dynamic organization of secondary lymphoid organ structure or host defense.",

In the gut, expression of the transcription factor RORgammat, which is involved in the development of lymphoid tissue-inducer cells, defined a previously unknown subset of NKp46+CD3- lymphocytes. Unlike RORgammat- lamina propria and dermis natural killer cells, gut RORgammat+NKp46+ cells produced interleukin 22. Our data show that lymphoid tissue-inducer cells and natural killer cells shared unanticipated similarities and emphasize the heterogeneity of NKp46+CD3- cells in innate immunity, lymphoid organization and local tissue repair.",

        "Abstract": "The requirements for in vivo steady state differentiation of IL-17-producing T-helper (Th17) cells, which are potent inflammation effectors, remain obscure. We report that Th17 cell differentiation in the lamina propria (LP) of the small intestine requires specific commensal microbiota and is inhibited by treating mice with selective antibiotics. Mice from different sources had marked differences in their Th17 cell numbers and animals lacking Th17 cells acquired them after introduction of bacteria from Th17 cell-sufficient mice. Differentiation of Th17 cells correlated with the presence of cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroidetes (CFB) bacteria in the intestine and was independent of toll-like receptor, IL-21 or IL-23 signaling, but required appropriate TGF-beta activation. Absence of Th17 cell-inducing bacteria was accompanied by increase in Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) in the LP. Our results suggest that composition of intestinal microbiota regulates the Th17:Treg balance in the LP and may thus influence intestinal immunity, tolerance, and susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is generated in the gut by both T cell-dependent and T cell-independent processes. The sites and the mechanisms for T cell-independent IgA synthesis remain elusive. Here we show that isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs) were sites where induction of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and IgA class switching of B cells took place in the absence of T cells. We also show that formation of ILFs was regulated by interactions between lymphoid tissue-inducer cells expressing the nuclear receptor ROR gamma t (ROR gamma t(+)LTi cells) and stromal cells (SCs). Activation of SCs by ROR gamma t(+)LTi cells through lymphotoxin (LT)-beta receptor (LT beta R) and simultaneously by bacteria through TLRs induced recruitment of dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells and formation of ILFs. These findings provide insight into the crosstalk between bacteria, ROR gamma t(+)LTi cells, SCs, DCs, and B cells required for ILF formation and establish a critical role of ILFs in T cell-independent IgA synthesis in gut.",

        "Abstract": "In a minority of eukaryotic mRNAs, a small functional upstream ORF (uORF), often performing a regulatory role, precedes the translation start site for the main product(s). Here, conserved uORFs in numerous ornithine decarboxylase homologs are identified from yeast to mammals. Most have noncanonical evolutionarily conserved start codons, the main one being AUU, which has not been known as an initiator for eukaryotic chromosomal genes. The AUG-less uORF present in mouse antizyme inhibitor, one of the ornithine decarboxylase homologs in mammals, mediates polyamine-induced repression of the downstream main ORF. This repression is part of an autoregulatory circuit, and one of its sensors is the AUU codon, which suggests that translation initiation codon identity is likely used for regulation in eukaryotes.",

A baseline separation of derivatives is achieved by isocratic elution on reverse phase column within 6 min. The method is linear in the range of 0.5-25 microM for homocysteine and glutathione, and in the range of 0.5-200 microM for cysteine. The limits of detection for homocysteine, cysteine and glutathione are 1.2, 1.4 and 2.0 pmol, respectively, per 20 microl injection. Within and between-run precision expressed as relative standard deviations are in the range of 1.35-4.38% and 0.89-4.13%, respectively.",

Enzyme hydrolysis releases 2-hexyl-6-hydrazino-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione, which couples with piperonal to form insoluble fluorescent hydrazone, precipitating on the enzyme locations and marking them. The fluorescent technique reveals precisely the enzymes locations at the lack of background noise in a single incubation step. It avoids most of the drawbacks of the previously proposed fluorescent histochemical techniques and can be valuable for the in situ studies of these enzymes in norm and pathology.",

        "Abstract": "Ornithine decarboxylase antizymes are proteins which negatively regulate cellular polyamine levels via their affects on polyamine synthesis and cellular uptake. In virtually all organisms from yeast to mammals, antizymes are encoded by two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). A +1 frameshift between frames is required for the synthesis of antizyme. Ribosomes change translation phase at the end of the first ORF in response to stimulatory signals embedded in mRNA. Since standard sequence analysis pipelines are currently unable to recognise sites of programmed ribosomal frameshifting, proper detection of full length antizyme coding sequences (CDS) requires conscientious manual evaluation by a human expert. The rapid growth of sequence information demands less laborious and more cost efficient solutions for this problem. This manuscript describes a rapid and accurate computer tool for antizyme CDS detection that requires minimal human involvement.",

        "Title": "TGF-beta-induced Foxp3 inhibits T(H)17 cell differentiation by antagonizing RORgammat function.",
        "Abstract": "T helper cells that produce IL-17 (T(H)17 cells) promote autoimmunity in mice and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory diseases. At mucosal surfaces, T(H)17 cells are thought to protect the host from infection, whereas regulatory T (T(reg)) cells control immune responses and inflammation triggered by the resident microflora. Differentiation of both cell types requires transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), but depends on distinct transcription factors: RORgammat (encoded by Rorc(gammat)) for T(H)17 cells and Foxp3 for T(reg) cells. How TGF-beta regulates the differentiation of T cells with opposing activities has been perplexing. Here we demonstrate that, together with pro-inflammatory cytokines, TGF-beta orchestrates T(H)17 cell differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner. At low concentrations, TGF-beta synergizes with interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-21 (refs 9-11) to promote IL-23 receptor (Il23r) expression, favouring T(H)17 cell differentiation. High concentrations of TGF-beta repress IL23r expression and favour Foxp3+ T(reg) cells. RORgammat and Foxp3 are co-expressed in naive CD4+ T cells exposed to TGF-beta and in a subset of T cells in the small intestinal lamina propria of the mouse. In vitro, TGF-beta-induced Foxp3 inhibits RORgammat function, at least in part through their interaction. Accordingly, lamina propria T cells that co-express both transcription factors produce less IL-17 (also known as IL-17a) than those that express RORgammat alone. IL-6, IL-21 and IL-23 relieve Foxp3-mediated inhibition of RORgammat, thereby promoting T(H)17 cell differentiation. Therefore, the decision of antigen-stimulated cells to differentiate into either T(H)17 or T(reg) cells depends on the cytokine-regulated balance of RORgammat and Foxp3.",

        "Abstract": "Infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance are now considered the most imperative global healthcare problem. In the search for new treatments, host defense, or antimicrobial, peptides have attracted considerable attention due to their various unique properties; however, attempts to develop in vivo therapies have been severely limited. Efforts to develop synthetic mimics of antimicrobial peptides (SMAMPs) have increased significantly in the last decade, and this review will focus primarily on the structural evolution of SMAMPs and their membrane activity. This review will attempt to make a bridge between the design of SMAMPs and the fundamentals of SMAMP-membrane interactions. In discussions regarding the membrane interaction of SMAMPs, close attention will be paid to the lipid composition of the bilayer. Despite many years of study, the exact conformational aspects responsible for the high selectivity of these AMPs and SMAMPs toward bacterial cells over mammalian cells are still not fully understood. The ability to design SMAMPs that are potently antimicrobial, yet nontoxic to mammalian cells has been demonstrated with a variety of molecular scaffolds. Initial animal studies show very good tissue distribution along with more than a 4-log reduction in bacterial counts. The results on SMAMPs are not only extremely promising for novel antibiotics, but also provide an optimistic picture for the greater challenge of general proteomimetics.",

This subset, referred to as Th17, is centrally involved in autoimmune disease and is important in host defense at mucosal surfaces. In mouse, a series of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-21, IL-23, and TGF-beta, function sequentially or synergistically to induce the Th17 lineage. Other cytokines, including IL-2, IL-4, IFNgamma, and IL-27, inhibit differentiation of this lineage.

        "Title": "Dynamics of the acetylcholinesterase tetramer.",
        "Abstract": "Acetylcholinesterase rapidly hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in cholinergic synapses, including the neuromuscular junction. The tetramer is the most important functional form of the enzyme. Two low-resolution crystal structures have been solved. One is compact with two of its four peripheral anionic sites (PAS) sterically blocked by complementary subunits. The other is a loose tetramer with all four subunits accessible to solvent. These structures lacked the C-terminal amphipathic t-peptide (WAT domain) that interacts with the proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD). A complete tetramer model (AChEt) was built based on the structure of the PRAD/WAT complex and the compact tetramer. Normal mode analysis suggested that AChEt could exist in several conformations with subunits fluctuating relative to one another. Here, a multiscale simulation involving all-atom molecular dynamics and C alpha-based coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations was carried out to investigate the large-scale intersubunit dynamics in AChEt. We sampled the ns-mus timescale motions and found that the tetramer indeed constitutes a dynamic assembly of monomers. The intersubunit fluctuation is correlated with the occlusion of the PAS. Such motions of the subunits \"gate\" ligand-protein association. The gates are open more than 80% of the time on average, which suggests a small reduction in ligand-protein binding. Despite the limitations in the starting model and approximations inherent in coarse graining, these results are consistent with experiments which suggest that binding of a substrate to the PAS is only somewhat hindered by the association of the subunits.",

        "Abstract": "T helper cells that produce interleukin 17 (IL-17; 'T(H)-17 cells') are a distinct subset of proinflammatory cells whose in vivo function requires IL-23 but whose in vitro differentiation requires only IL-6 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). We demonstrate here that IL-6 induced expression of IL-21 that amplified an autocrine loop to induce more IL-21 and IL-23 receptor in naive CD4(+) T cells. Both IL-21 and IL-23, along with TGF-beta, induced IL-17 expression independently of IL-6. The effects of IL-6 and IL-21 depended on STAT3, a transcription factor required for the differentiation of T(H)-17 cells in vivo. IL-21 and IL-23 induced the orphan nuclear receptor RORgammat, which in synergy with STAT3 promoted IL-17 expression. IL-6 therefore orchestrates a series of 'downstream' cytokine-dependent signaling pathways that, in concert with TGF-beta, amplify RORgammat-dependent differentiation of T(H)-17 cells.",

        "Abstract": "We explore the conformational dynamics of a homology model of the human alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor using molecular dynamics simulation and analyses of root mean-square fluctuations, block partitioning of segmental motion, and principal component analysis. The results reveal flexible regions and concerted global motions of the subunits encompassing extracellular and transmembrane domains of the subunits. The most relevant motions comprise a bending, hinged at the beta10-M1 region, accompanied by concerted tilting of the M2 helices that widens the intracellular end of the channel. Despite the nanosecond timescale, the observations suggest that tilting of the M2 helices may initiate opening of the pore. The results also reveal direct coupling between a twisting motion of the extracellular domain and dynamic changes of M2. Covariance analysis of interresidue motions shows that this coupling arises through a network of residues within the Cys and M2-M3 loops where Phe135 is stabilized within a hydrophobic pocket formed by Leu270 and Ile271. The resulting concerted motion causes a downward shift of the M2 helices that disrupts a hydrophobic girdle formed by 9' and 13' residues.",

        "Abstract": "Heterosubtypic immunity (HSI) is defined as cross-protection to infection with an influenza A virus serotype other than the one used for primary infection. Although HSI has been thought to be mediated by serotype cross-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that recognize conserved epitopes of structural proteins, recent studies suggest that antibodies (Abs) may make a significant contribution. In this study, we provide further evidence for the role of Abs in HSI using transgenic mice lacking terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase (TdT), which adds N nucleotides to V-D and D-J junctions of the complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) (TdT(-/-)) and mice with altered Ab repertoires due to replacement of the complete locus of heavy chain diversity segments (D(H)) with an altered D(H) segment (namely, Delta D-iD). Both types of mice failed to generate complete HSI, although they were able to mount protective immunity to a homologous challenge. Lower levels of virus-specific antibodies along with more severely impaired HSI were observed in TdT(-/-) mice compared to those in Delta D-iD mice, while CTL activity remained unchanged in both types of mice. These findings indicate that a properly diversified antibody repertoire is required for HSI and that N addition by TdT is a more effective mechanism in the induction of a properly diversified antibody repertoire and, therefore, complete HSI. The results suggest that the diversity of the antibody repertoire as determined by the composition of the D region of HCDR3 and by N addition are among the mechanisms selected for in evolution to create a favorable environment to resolve infections with mutated viruses.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms of gating and ion permeation in biological channels and receptors has been a long-standing challenge in biophysics. Recent advances in structural biology have revealed the architecture of a number of transmembrane channels and allowed detailed, molecular-level insight into these systems. Herein, we have examined the barriers to ion conductance and origins of ion selectivity in models of the cationic human alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and the anionic alpha1 glycine receptor (GlyR), based on the structure of Torpedo nAChR. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine water density profiles along the channel length, and they established that both receptor pores were fully hydrated. The very low water density in the middle of the nAChR pore indicated the existence of a hydrophobic constriction. By contrast, the pore of GlyR was lined with hydrophilic residues and remained well-hydrated throughout. Adaptive biasing force simulations allowed us to reconstruct potentials of mean force (PMFs) for chloride and sodium ions in the two receptors. For the nicotinic receptor we observed barriers to ion translocation associated with rings of hydrophobic residues-Val13' and Leu9'-in the middle of the transmembrane domain. This finding further substantiates the hydrophobic gating hypothesis for nAChR. The PMF revealed no significant hydrophobic barrier for chloride translocation in GlyR. For both receptors nonpermeant ions displayed considerable barriers. Thus, the overall electrostatics and the presence of rings of charged residues at the entrance and exit of the channels were sufficient to explain the experimentally observed anion and cation selectivity.",

Ribosomes synthesizing antizyme start in one ORF and at the codon 5' adjacent to its stop codon, shift +1 to a second and partially overlapping ORF which encodes most of the protein. The ribosomal frameshifting is a sensor and effector of an autoregulatory circuit which is conserved in animals, fungi and protists. Stimulatory signals encoded 5' and 3' of the shift site act to program the frameshifting. Despite overall conservation, many individual branches have evolved specific features surrounding the frameshift site. Among these are RNA pseudoknots, RNA stem-loops, conserved primary RNA sequences, nascent peptide sequences and branch-specific 'shifty' codons.",

        "Abstract": "Endonuclease IV belongs to a class of important apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases involved in DNA repair. Although a structure-based mechanistic hypothesis has been put forth for this enzyme, the detailed catalytic mechanism has remained unknown. Using thermodynamic integration in the context of ab initio quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics, we examined certain aspects of the phosphodiester cleavage step in the mechanism. We found the reaction proceeded through a synchronous bimolecular (A(N)D(N)) mechanism with reaction free energy and barrier of -3.5 and 20.6 kcal/mol, in agreement with experimental estimates. In the course of the reaction the trinuclear active site of endonuclease IV underwent dramatic local conformational changes: shifts in the mode of coordination of both substrate and first-shell ligands. This qualitative finding supports the notion that structural rearrangements in the active sites of multinuclear enzymes are integral to biological function.",

        "Abstract": "Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) acts as a biologically essential processivity factor that encircles DNA and provides binding sites for polymerase, flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1) and ligase during DNA replication and repair. We have computationally characterized the interactions of human and Archaeoglobus fulgidus PCNA trimer with double-stranded DNA (ds DNA) using multi-nanosecond classical molecular dynamics simulations. The results reveal the interactions of DNA passing through the PCNA trimeric ring including the contacts formed, overall orientation and motion with respect to the sliding clamp. Notably, we observe pronounced tilting of the axis of dsDNA with respect to the PCNA ring plane reflecting interactions between the DNA phosphodiester backbone and positively charged arginine and lysine residues lining the PCNA inner surface. Covariance matrix analysis revealed a pattern of correlated motions within and between the three equivalent subunits involving the PCNA C-terminal region and linker strand associated with partner protein binding sites. Additionally, principal component analysis identified low frequency global PCNA subunit motions suitable for translocation along duplex DNA. The PCNA motions and interactions with the DNA minor groove, identified here computationally, provide an unexpected basis for PCNA to act in the coordinated handoff of intermediates from polymerase to FEN-1 to ligase during DNA replication and repair.",

        "Abstract": "The synthesis of the protein antizyme requires a +1 ribosomal frameshift event. The frameshifting serves as a regulatory sensor. Antizyme homologs have been identified in diverse organisms ranging from yeast to human and characterized in a disparate subset. Most vertebrates have multiple antizyme paralogs. Here we present identification in the zebrafish Danio rerio of a heretofore unknown member of the antizyme gene family. This novel antizyme does not correspond to any of the known orthologous groups in vertebrates and unlike most other antizymes is preferentially expressed in the retinal ganglion cell layer of the eye. In addition to the retina, it is also expressed in the brain and somites.",

        "Abstract": "IL-17-producing T lymphocytes have been recently shown to comprise a distinct lineage of proinflammatory T helper cells, termed Th17 cells, that are major contributors to autoimmune disease. We show here that the orphan nuclear receptor RORgammat is the key transcription factor that orchestrates the differentiation of this effector cell lineage. RORgammat induces transcription of the genes encoding IL-17 and the related cytokine IL-17F in na\u00efve CD4(+) T helper cells and is required for their expression in response to IL-6 and TGF-beta, the cytokines known to induce IL-17. Th17 cells are constitutively present throughout the intestinal lamina propria, express RORgammat, and are absent in mice deficient for RORgammat or IL-6. Mice with RORgammat-deficient T cells have attenuated autoimmune disease and lack tissue-infiltrating Th17 cells. Together, these studies suggest that RORgammat is a key regulator of immune homeostasis and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Tyrosine and glycine constitute 40% of complementarity determining region 3 of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (CDR-H3), the center of the classic antigen-binding site. To assess the role of D(H) RF1-encoded tyrosine and glycine in regulating CDR-H3 content and potentially influencing B cell function, we created mice limited to a single D(H) encoding asparagine, histidine, and arginines in RF1. Tyrosine and glycine content in CDR-H3 was halved. Bone marrow and spleen mature B cell and peritoneal cavity B-1 cell numbers were also halved, whereas marginal zone B cell numbers increased. Serum immunoglobulin G subclass levels and antibody titers to T-dependent and T-independent antigens all declined. Thus, violation of the conserved preference for tyrosine and glycine in D(H) RF1 alters CDR-H3 content and impairs B cell development and antibody production.",

        "Abstract": "cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) is a key transcription factor in the differentiation of round spermatids into mature spermatozoa. During spermiogenesis, CREM is regulated in part by activator of CREM in the testis (ACT), which activates CREM in a phosphorylation-independent fashion. We hypothesized that the ACT gene, which is expressed exclusively in the testis, could be involved in male factor infertility in patients with idiopathic-impaired spermatogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced the coding regions and flanking intronic regions of the ACT gene in 96 azoo- or oligospermic patients and 69 fertile controls. A total of 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was identified, and four of them leading to amino acid substitutions. An association study was performed based on calculated haplotype frequencies, and statistically significant differences were found between the patient and control populations for some haplotypes. To help establish the evolutionary relationships between the haplotypes, the coding regions of both the chimpanzee and the gorilla ACT gene were sequenced and evaluated. To test whether the different haplotypes conferred a functional change to the ACT protein, a yeast two-hybrid assay was designed to test the interaction between the two most divergent ACT haplotypes and their known binding partners, CREM and KIF17b. We identified one ACT haplotype that had a 45% reduction in its interaction with CREM. Our results suggest that different haplotypes within the ACT gene may contribute to male factor subfertility.",

A strong link has been established between these functions and the conformation that the polymers adopt in solution and at lipid bilayer interfaces. Thus, it is imperative for molecular dynamics simulations designed to probe the conformational behavior of these systems to accurately describe the torsional degrees of freedom. Standard force fields were shown to be deficient in this respect. Therefore, we have computed the relevant torsional energy profiles using a series of constrained geometry optimizations. We have also determined electrostatic parameters using our results in combination with standard RESP charge optimization. Force constants for bond and angle potentials were calculated by iteratively matching quantum and classical normal modes via a Monte Carlo scheme. The resulting new set of parameters accurately described the conformation and dynamical behavior of the arylamide polymers.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate calculation of pK(a) values and free energies for acid/base reactions in the condensed phase has been a long-standing goal of theoretical chemistry. We present a novel application of the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics method to the problem of relative pK(a) determination. As a particular example, we focus on the second stage in the dissociation of histidine, a process that holds special importance for biology. Using constrained molecular dynamics, we have analyzed the structural, electronic, and dynamical transformations taking place along a preselected, intuitive reaction coordinate. By integrating the potentials of mean force for the deprotonation of histidine and for a reference reaction, autodissociation of water, we obtain a pK(a) value of 6.8, which appears to be in good agreement with the experimental estimate of 6.1. Detailed analysis was undertaken to determine the value of the constraint, which transformed the N*-H* from a covalent to a hydrogen bond. This helped to identify a number of properties that could be successfully used in monitoring the dissociation process. Additional analysis in terms of electron localization functions provided valuable insight into the nature of the deprotonation reaction.",

        "Abstract": "The antizyme family is a group of small proteins that play a role in cell growth and division by regulating the biosynthesis of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, spermine). Antizymes regulate polyamine levels primarily through binding ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), an enzyme key to polyamine production, and targeting ODC for destruction by the 26S proteosome. Ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 3 (OAZ3) is a testis-specific antizyme paralog and the only antizyme expressed in the mid to late stages of spermatogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Using quantum chemistry plus ab initio molecular dynamics and classical molecular dynamics methods, we address the relationship between molecular conformation and the biomedical function of arylamide polymers. Specifically, we have developed new torsional parameters for a class of these polymers and applied them in a study of the interaction between a representative arylamide and one of its biomedical targets, the anticoagulant drug heparin. Our main finding is that the torsional barrier of a C(aromatic)-C(carbonyl) bond increases significantly upon addition of an o-OCH2CH2NH3+ substituent on the benzene ring. Our molecular dynamics studies that are based on the original general AMBER force field (GAFF) and GAFF modified to include our newly developed torsional parameters show that the binding mechanism between the arylamide and heparin is very sensitive to the choice of torsional potentials. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation of the arylamide independently confirms the degree of flexibility we obtain by classical molecular dynamics when newly developed torsional potentials are used.",

        "Abstract": "We have applied molecular dynamics to investigate the structural properties and activity of recently synthesized amphiphilic polymethacrylate derivatives, designed to mimic the antimicrobial activity of natural peptides. The composition, molecular weight, and hydrophobicity (ratio of hydrophobic and cationic units) of these short copolymers can be modulated to achieve structural diversity, which is crucial in controlling the antimicrobial activity. We have carried out all-atom molecular dynamics to systematically investigate the conformations adopted by these copolymers in water and at the water-lipid interface as a function of sequence and the chemical nature of the monomers. For two sequences, we observe partial insertion into the bilayer. Formation of strong interactions between the lipid headgroups and the amine groups of the polymers assists in the initial association with the lipids. However, the primary driving force for the observed partial insertion appears to be the hydrophobic effect. Our results indicate sensitive dependence of the overall shape on the sequence, suggesting that experimentally observed changes in activity can be correlated with particular sequences, providing an avenue for rational design.",

        "Abstract": "An autoregulatory translational shift to the +1 frame is required for the expression of ornithine decarboxylase antizyme from fungi to mammals. In most eukaryotes, including all vertebrates and a majority of the studied fungi/yeast, the site on antizyme mRNA where the shift occurs is UCC-UGA. The mechanism of the frameshift on this sequence likely involves nearly universal aspects of the eukaryotic translational machinery. Nevertheless, a mammalian antizyme frameshift cassette yields predominantly -2 frameshift in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, instead of the +1 in mammals. The recently identified endogenous S. cerevisiae antizyme mRNA has an atypical shift site: UGC-GCG-UGA. It is shown here that endogenous S. cerevisiae antizyme frameshifting is +1 rather than -2. We discuss how antizyme frameshifting in budding yeasts exploits peculiarities of their tRNA balance, and relate this to prior studies on Ty frameshifting.",

        "Abstract": "A recently identified gene, hclA (synonym: ort), codes for an ionotrophic histamine receptor subunit in Drosophila melanogaster, and known hclA mutations lead to defects in the visual system, neurologic disorders and changed responsiveness to neurotoxins. To investigate whether this novel class of receptors is common across the Insecta, we analysed the genomes of 15 other insect species (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera) and revealed orthologs of hclA in all of them. The predicted receptor domain of HCLA is extensively conserved (86-100% of identity) among the 16 proteins. Minor changes in the amino acid sequence that includes the putative transmembrane domains (TMs) 1-3 were found in non-drosophilid species only. Substantial amino acid variability was observed in the signal polypeptides, the intracellular loop domains and in TM4, in good accordance with known data on sequence variations in ligand-gated ion channels. Pairwise comparisons revealed three consensus sequences for N-glycosylation, conserved in HCLAs of all species studied, as well as a drosophilid-specific putative phosphorylation site. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that hclA-mRNA is abundant in heads of adult Drosophila. However, species- and sex-specific variations of the hclA expression levels were also observed.",

        "Abstract": "To test the contribution of individual D gene segments to B cell development and function, we used gene targeting to create mice that contain only DFL16.1 in the DH locus. We term this D-limited IgH allele DeltaD-DFL. Although the absolute number of IgM+IgD- B cells in the bone marrow was decreased, homozygous DeltaD-DFL BALB/c mice contained normal numbers of IgM+IgD+ B cells in bone marrow and spleen and normal numbers of B1a, B1b, and B2 cells in the peritoneal cavity. Bone marrow IgM+IgD+ B cells express a CDR-H3 repertoire similar in length and amino acid composition to the DFL16.1 subset of the wild-type BALB/c repertoire but divergent from sequences that do not contain DFL16.1. This similarity in content is the product of both germline bias and somatic selection, especially in the transition to the mature IgM+IgD+ stage of development. Serum Ig concentrations and the humoral immune response to a T-dependent Ag ([4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl]acetyl hapten) were nearly identical to wild-type littermate controls. A greater variance in the immune response to the T-independent Ag (alpha(1-->3)-dextran) was observed in DeltaD-DFL homozygotes, with half of the mice exhibiting levels below the range exhibited by controls. Although limited to a repertoire specific to DFL16.1, the presence of a single DH gene segment of normal sequence was sufficient for development of normal numbers of mature B cells and for robust humoral immune function.",

        "Title": "Development of the expressed Ig CDR-H3 repertoire is marked by focusing of constraints in length, amino acid use, and charge that are first established in early B cell progenitors.",
        "Abstract": "To gain insight into the mechanisms that regulate the development of the H chain CDR3 (CDR-H3), we used the scheme of Hardy to sort mouse bone marrow B lineage cells into progenitor, immature, and mature B cell fractions, and then performed sequence analysis on V(H)7183-containing Cmu transcripts. The essential architecture of the CDR-H3 repertoire observed in the mature B cell fraction F was already established in the early pre-B cell fraction C. These architectural features include V(H) gene segment use preference, D(H) family usage, J(H) rank order, predicted structures of the CDR-H3 base and loop, and the amino acid composition and average hydrophobicity of the CDR-H3 loop. With development, the repertoire was focused by eliminating outliers to what appears to be a preferred repertoire in terms of length, amino acid composition, and average hydrophobicity. Unlike humans, the average length of CDR-H3 increased during development. The majority of this increase came from enhanced preservation of J(H) sequence. This was associated with an increase in the prevalence of tyrosine. With an accompanying increase in glycine, a shift in hydrophobicity was observed in the CDR-H3 loop from near neutral in fraction C (-0.08 +/- 0.03) to mild hydrophilic in fraction F (-0.17 +/- 0.02). Fundamental constraints on the sequence and structure of CDR-H3 are thus established before surface IgM expression.",

        "Abstract": "We have used ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) to investigate the dynamical flexibility of the bridged binuclear structural motif in the active site of arginase. Dynamical transformations play a crucial role in catalysis. We have provided direct insight into the motions of the first-shell ligands with emphasis on the chelating and bridging carboxylates. In the case of the terminal Asp234 residue we observe changes in the binding mode (carboxylate shifts). AIMD dynamics of sufficient duration has allowed us to observe proton transfer from the bridging nucleophile to the catalytically essential Asp 128 residue and to map the underlying free energy surface in terms of simple reaction coordinates, such as the oxygen-oxygen distance Ro-o and the asymmetric stretch delta. This has provided valuable insight into the nature of the last step of the catalytic cycle. In addition, constrained molecular dynamics permitted us to compare the deprotonation free energy of the bridging nucleophile in the case of native versus metal-depleted arginase.",

        "Abstract": "Molecular dynamics results are presented for a coarse-grain model of 1,2-di-n-alkanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, water, and a capped cylindrical model of a transmembrane peptide. We first demonstrate that different alkanoyl-length lipids are miscible in the liquid-disordered lamellar (Lalpha) phase. The transmembrane peptide is constructed of hydrophobic sites with hydrophilic caps. The hydrophobic length of the peptide is smaller than the hydrophobic thickness of a bilayer consisting of an equal mixture of long and short alkanoyl tail lipids. When incorporated into the membrane, a meniscus forms in the vicinity of the peptide and the surrounding area is enriched in the short lipid. The meniscus region draws water into it. In the regions that are depleted of water, the bilayers can fuse. The lipid headgroups then rearrange to solvate the newly formed water pores, resulting in an inverted phase. This mechanism appears to be a viable pathway for the experimentally observed Lalpha-to-inverse hexagonal (HII) peptide-induced phase transition.",

Quantum mechanical molecular modelling of enzyme-substrate interactions in the enzyme active site shows that in the case of substrates lacking local symmetry, the productive binding implies two nonsymmetrical arrangements with respect to the two positively charged guanidinium residues of ArgA145 and ArgB263. This indicates a crucial role of the specified arginine pair in the substrate- and stereoselectivity of penicillin acylase.",

        "Abstract": "The expression of eukaryotic antizyme genes requires +1 translational frameshifting. The frameshift in decoding most vertebrate antizyme mRNAs is stimulated by an RNA pseudoknot 3' of the frameshift site. Although the frameshifting event itself is conserved in a wide variety of organisms from yeast to mammals, until recently no corresponding 3' RNA pseudoknot was known in invertebrate antizyme mRNAs. A pseudoknot, different in structure and origin from its vertebrate counterparts, is now shown to be encoded by the antizyme genes of distantly related invertebrates. Identification of the 3' frameshifting stimulator in intermediate species or other invertebrates remains unresolved.",

        "Abstract": "A well-established feature of the translation initiation region, which attracts the ribosomes to the prokaryotic mRNAs, is a purine rich area called Shine/Dalgarno sequence (SD). There are examples of various other sequences, which despite having no similarity to an SD sequence are capable of enhancing and/or initiating translation. The mechanisms by which these sequences affect translation remain unclear, but a base pairing between mRNA and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is proposed to be the likely mechanism. In this study, using a computational approach, we identified a non-SD signal found specifically in the translation initiation regions of Escherichia coli mRNAs, which contain super strong SD sequences. Nine of the 11 E. coli translation initiation regions, which were previously identified for having super strong SD sequences, also contained six or more nucleotides complementary to box-17 on the 16S rRNA (nucleotides 418-554). Mutational analyses of those initiation sequences indicated that when complementarity to box-17 was eliminated, the efficiency of the examined sequences to mediate the translation of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) mRNA was reduced. The results suggest that mRNA sequences with complementarity to box-17 of 16S rRNA may function as enhancers for translation in E. coli.",

        "Abstract": "Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) methods were used to investigate the structural features of the active site of the binuclear enzyme rat liver arginase. Special emphasis was placed on the crucial role of the second shell ligand interactions. These interactions were systematically studied by performing calculations on models of varying size. It was determined that a water molecule, and not hydroxide, is the bridging exogenous ligand. The carboxylate ligands facilitate the close approach of the Mn (II) ions by attenuating the metal-metal electrostatic repulsion. Of the two metals, Mn(A) was shown to carry a larger positive charge. Analysis of the electronic properties of the active site revealed that orbitals involving the terminal Asp234 residue, as well as the flexible micro-1,1 bridging Asp232, lie at high energies, suggesting weaker coordination. This is reflected in certain structural variability present in our models and is also consistent with recent experimental findings. Finally, implications of our findings for the biological function of the enzyme are delineated.",

The calculated effect of H/D isotope substitution on the water structure is much smaller than the difference between the classical and quantum path integral results, and is in excellent agreement with the measured H/D difference data from both neutron and x-ray scattering.",

        "Abstract": "In a search for non-Shine-Dalgarno (non-SD) translational initiators, two combinatorial expression libraries (denoted R(1) and R(2)) were constructed containing randomized decanucleotide regions placed at either 6 (R(1)) or 11 (R(2)) nucleotides upstream of a modified chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. To prevent sporadic formation of SD-like sequences the content of G in the randomized region was restricted to 3% only. The two libraries were transformed in Escherichia coli cells and screened for chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance. More than 50 clones capable of tolerating Cm concentrations from 50 micro g/ml to more than 800 micro g/ml were selected. With few exceptions only, the non-SD sequences found in the Cm-resistant clones did not show any significant homology with other known non-SD initiators or enhancers of translation. Statistical (chi(2)) analysis of the distribution of nucleotides in the new non-SD translational initiators showed a different pattern from that of the conventional SD sequences. In few of the clones the yield of CAT exceeded that of the referent (SD-containing) construct. The most productive clones carried the decanucleotides ATTTACCTCC, CCAATCTAC, TTCAATATTT, and TATTCCCCCA, and the corresponding yield of CAT obtained with them was 2.70, 2.06, 2.12 and 1.32 times, respectively, higher than that of the SD-bearing construct.",

        "Abstract": "During translation, a string of non-overlapping triplet codons in messenger RNA is decoded into protein. The ability of a ribosome to decode mRNA without shifting between reading frames is a strict requirement for accurate protein biosynthesis. Despite enormous progress in understanding the mechanism of transfer RNA selection, the mechanism by which the correct reading frame is maintained remains unclear. In this report, evidence is presented that supports the idea that the translational frame is controlled mainly by the stability of codon-anticodon interactions at the P site. The relative instability of such interactions may lead to dissociation of the P-site tRNA from its codon, and formation of a complex with an overlapping codon, the process known as P-site tRNA slippage. We propose that this process is central to all known cases of +1 ribosomal frameshifting, including that required for the decoding of the yeast transposable element Ty3. An earlier model for the decoding of this element proposed 'out-of-frame' binding of A-site tRNA without preceding P-site tRNA slippage.",

Both linear and coordination constraints were employed, and the structural, electronic, and dynamical transformations along the respective reaction coordinates were analyzed. The calculated potentials of mean force for the dissociation of a hydrogen atom from the Nepsilon and Ndelta positions of the imidazole ring reveal that protonated forms are approximately 9.0-9.5 kcal/mol more stable than the deprotonated. This result seems to agree well with the experimental estimate based on pKa. A possible transition state for the deprotonation has also been identified. Analysis of the electron localization function indicates that the proton transfer along the selected reaction path is not a fully concerted process.",

The program was used to calculate and evaluate the distribution of 7-base oligonucleotides in the 6000+ putative protein-coding sequences of S. cerevisiae preliminary to the laboratory testing of the most highly underrepresented oligos for frameshifting efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out for aqueous NaOH and KOH solutions under ambient conditions over a wide range of concentrations. From these simulations, we have observed a continuous change of the water structure with added hydroxide, characterized by a significant shift of the second peak of the OO radial distribution functions to shorter distances. At the highest concentration investigated, the normal tetrahedral coordination of pure water is completely missing, a result that is consistent with a recent neutron diffraction experiment. The added hydroxide also gives rise to some unique spectroscopic features, including a \"free\" O-H stretch, a broadening of the normal water OH stretching band, and a large blue shift of both the librational band and the low-frequency translation. These results are in good agreement with the experimental data. Finally, it was demonstrated that the structural and dynamical behavior is inextricably linked to the formation of compact hydroxide-water complexes.",
