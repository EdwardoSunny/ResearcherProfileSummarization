        "Abstract": "One-third of the mammalian proteome is comprised of transmembrane and secretory proteins that are synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we investigate the spatial distribution and regulation of mRNAs encoding these membrane and secretory proteins (termed \"secretome\" mRNAs) through live cell, single molecule tracking to directly monitor the position and translation states of secretome mRNAs on ER and their relationship to other organelles. Notably, translation of secretome mRNAs occurred preferentially near lysosomes on ER marked by the ER junction-associated protein, Lunapark. Knockdown of Lunapark reduced the extent of secretome mRNA translation without affecting translation of other mRNAs. Less secretome mRNA translation also occurred when lysosome function was perturbed by raising lysosomal pH or inhibiting lysosomal proteases. Secretome mRNA translation near lysosomes was enhanced during amino acid deprivation. Addition of the integrated stress response inhibitor, ISRIB, reversed the translation inhibition seen in Lunapark knockdown cells, implying an eIF2 dependency. Altogether, these findings uncover a novel coordination between ER and lysosomes, in which local release of amino acids and other factors from ER-associated lysosomes patterns and regulates translation of mRNAs encoding secretory and membrane proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Peroxisomal disorders (PDs) are a heterogenous group of diseases caused by defects in peroxisome biogenesis or functions. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is the most prevalent form of PDs and results from mutations in the ABCD1 gene, which encodes a transporter mediating the uptake of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). The curative approaches for PDs are very limited. Here, we investigated whether cholesterol accumulation in the lysosomes is a biochemical feature shared by a broad spectrum of PDs. We individually knocked down fifteen PD-associated genes in cultured cells and found ten induced cholesterol accumulation in the lysosome. 2-Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HPCD) effectively alleviated the cholesterol accumulation phenotype in PD-mimicking cells through reducing intracellular cholesterol content as well as promoting cholesterol redistribution to other cellular membranes. In ABCD1 knockdown cells, HPCD treatment lowered reactive oxygen species and VLCFA to normal levels. In Abcd1 knockout mice, HPCD injections reduced cholesterol and VLCFA sequestration in the brain and adrenal cortex. The plasma levels of adrenocortical hormones were increased and the behavioral abnormalities were greatly ameliorated upon HPCD administration. Together, our results suggest that defective cholesterol transport underlies most, if not all, PDs, and that HPCD can serve as a novel and effective strategy for the treatment of PDs.",

        "Abstract": "Long-distance RNA transport enables local protein synthesis at metabolically-active sites distant from the nucleus. This process ensures an appropriate spatial organization of proteins, vital to polarized cells such as neurons. Here, we present a mechanism for RNA transport in which RNA granules \"hitchhike\" on moving lysosomes. In\u00a0vitro biophysical modeling, live-cell microscopy, and unbiased proximity labeling proteomics reveal that annexin A11 (ANXA11), an RNA granule-associated phosphoinositide-binding protein, acts as a molecular tether between RNA granules and lysosomes. ANXA11 possesses an N-terminal low complexity domain, facilitating its phase separation into membraneless RNA granules, and a C-terminal membrane binding domain, enabling interactions with lysosomes. RNA granule transport requires ANXA11, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated mutations in ANXA11 impair RNA granule transport by disrupting their interactions with lysosomes. Thus, ANXA11 mediates neuronal RNA transport by tethering RNA granules to actively-transported lysosomes, performing a critical cellular function that is disrupted in ALS.",

        "Abstract": "Most mammalian cells take up cholesterol from low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) via receptor-mediated endocytosis. After reaching lysosomes, LDL-derived cholesterol continues to transport to downstream organelles including the ER for specific structural and functional needs. Peroxisomes are recently found to receive cholesterol from lysosomes through lysosome-peroxisome membrane contacts. However, whether and how cholesterol is conveyed from peroxisomes to the ER remain unknown. Here, by combining high-resolution microscopic analyses and in vitro reconstitution of highly purified organelles or artificial liposomes, we demonstrate that peroxisomes form membrane contacts with the ER through the interaction between peroxisomal PI(4,5)P",

        "Abstract": "Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) is a lysosome luminal protein that functions in concert with NPC1 to mediate egress of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol from lysosome. The nuclear factor kappa B subunit 2 (NF-\u03baB2) protein is a component of NF-\u03baB transcription factor complex critically implicated in immune and inflammatory responses. Here, we report that NF-\u03baB2 regulates intracellular cholesterol transport by controlling NPC2 expression. RNAi-mediated disruption of NF-\u03baB2, as well as other signaling members of the non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway, caused intracellular cholesterol accumulation. Blockage of the non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway suppressed NPC2 expression, whereas Lymphotoxin \u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R) activation or Baff receptor (BaffR) stimulation up-regulated the mRNA abundance and protein level of NPC2. Further, NF-\u03baB2 activated NPC2 transcription through direct binding to its promoter region. We also observed cholesterol accumulation in NF-\u03baB2-deficient zebrafish embryo and NF-\u03baB2 mutant mice. Collectively, these data identify a regulatory role for the non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway in intracellular cholesterol trafficking and suggest a link between cholesterol transport and immune system.",

However, the mechanism underlying intracellular cholesterol transport has remained largely unknown. We established an amphotericin B-based assay enabling a genome-wide shRNA screen for delayed LDL-cholesterol transport and identified 341 hits with particular enrichment of peroxisome genes, suggesting a previously unappreciated pathway for cholesterol transport. We show dynamic membrane contacts between peroxisome and lysosome, which are mediated by lysosomal Synaptotagmin VII binding to the lipid PI(4,5)P2 on peroxisomal membrane. LDL-cholesterol enhances such contacts, and cholesterol is transported from lysosome to peroxisome. Disruption of critical peroxisome genes leads to cholesterol accumulation in lysosome. Together, these findings reveal an unexpected role of peroxisome in intracellular cholesterol transport. We further demonstrate massive cholesterol accumulation in human patient cells and mouse model of peroxisomal disorders, suggesting a contribution of abnormal cholesterol accumulation to these diseases.",
