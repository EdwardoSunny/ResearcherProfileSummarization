        "Abstract": "Human genetic studies of critical COVID-19 pneumonia have revealed the essential role of type I interferon-dependent innate immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, an association between the HLA-B\u221715:01 allele and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated individuals was recently reported, suggesting a contribution of pre-existing T\u00a0cell-dependent adaptive immunity. We report a lack of association of classical HLA alleles, including HLA-B\u221715:01, with pre-omicron asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated participants in a prospective population-based study in the United States (191 asymptomatic vs. 945 symptomatic COVID-19 cases). Moreover, we found no such association in the international COVID Human Genetic Effort cohort (206 asymptomatic vs. 574 mild or moderate COVID-19 cases and 1,625 severe or critical COVID-19 cases). Finally, in the Human Challenge Characterisation study, the three HLA-B\u221715:01 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed symptoms. As with other acute primary infections studied, no classical HLA alleles favoring an asymptomatic course of SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified.",

        "Abstract": "New Jersey was among the first states impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with one of the highest overall death rates in the nation. Nevertheless, relatively few reports have been published focusing specifically on New Jersey. Here we report on molecular, clinical, and epidemiologic observations, from the largest healthcare network in the state, in a cohort of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We conducted molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal swabs collected in nine hospitals from December 2020 through June 2022, using both whole genome sequencing (WGS) and a real-time RT-PCR screening assay targeting spike protein mutations found in variants of concern (VOCs) within our region. De-identified clinical data were obtained retrospectively, including demographics, COVID-19 vaccination status, ICU admission, ventilator support, mortality, and medical history. Statistical analyses were performed to identify associations between SARS-CoV-2 variants, vaccination status, clinical outcomes, and medical risk factors. A total of 5007 SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal swabs were successfully screened and/or sequenced. Variant screening identified three predominant VOCs, including Alpha (",

        "Abstract": "Light touch sensation begins with activation of low-threshold mechanoreceptor (LTMR) endings in the skin and propagation of their signals to the spinal cord and brainstem. We found that the clustered protocadherin gamma (Pcdhg) gene locus, which encodes 22 cell-surface homophilic binding proteins, is required in somatosensory neurons for normal behavioral reactivity to a range of tactile stimuli. Developmentally, distinct Pcdhg isoforms mediate LTMR synapse formation through neuron-neuron interactions and peripheral axonal branching through neuron-glia interactions. The Pcdhgc3 isoform mediates homophilic interactions between sensory axons and spinal cord neurons to promote synapse formation in\u00a0vivo and is sufficient to induce postsynaptic specializations in\u00a0vitro. Moreover, loss of Pcdhgs and somatosensory synaptic inputs to the dorsal horn leads to fewer corticospinal synapses on dorsal horn neurons. These findings reveal essential roles for Pcdhg isoform diversity in somatosensory neuron synapse formation, peripheral axonal branching, and stepwise assembly of central mechanosensory circuitry.",

        "Abstract": "X-linked recessive deficiency of TLR7, a MyD88- and IRAK-4-dependent endosomal ssRNA sensor, impairs SARS-CoV-2 recognition and type I IFN production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), thereby underlying hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia with high penetrance. We report 22 unvaccinated patients with autosomal recessive MyD88 or IRAK-4 deficiency infected with SARS-CoV-2 (mean age: 10.9 yr; 2 mo to 24 yr), originating from 17 kindreds from eight countries on three continents. 16 patients were hospitalized: six with moderate, four with severe, and six with critical pneumonia, one of whom died. The risk of hypoxemic pneumonia increased with age. The risk of invasive mechanical ventilation was also much greater than in age-matched controls from the general population (OR: 74.7, 95% CI: 26.8-207.8, P < 0.001). The patients' susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 can be attributed to impaired TLR7-dependent type I IFN production by pDCs, which do not sense SARS-CoV-2 correctly. Patients with inherited MyD88 or IRAK-4 deficiency were long thought to be selectively vulnerable to pyogenic bacteria, but also have a high risk of hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia.",

        "Abstract": "Autoantibodies neutralizing type I interferons (IFNs) can underlie critical COVID-19 pneumonia and yellow fever vaccine disease. We report here on 13 patients harboring autoantibodies neutralizing IFN-\u03b12 alone (five patients) or with IFN-\u03c9 (eight patients) from a cohort of 279 patients (4.7%) aged 6-73 yr with critical influenza pneumonia. Nine and four patients had antibodies neutralizing high and low concentrations, respectively, of IFN-\u03b12, and six and two patients had antibodies neutralizing high and low concentrations, respectively, of IFN-\u03c9. The patients' autoantibodies increased influenza A virus replication in both A549 cells and reconstituted human airway epithelia. The prevalence of these antibodies was significantly higher than that in the general population for patients <70 yr of age (5.7 vs. 1.1%, P = 2.2 \u00d7 10-5), but not >70 yr of age (3.1 vs. 4.4%, P = 0.68). The risk of critical influenza was highest in patients with antibodies neutralizing high concentrations of both IFN-\u03b12 and IFN-\u03c9 (OR = 11.7, P = 1.3 \u00d7 10-5), especially those <70 yr old (OR = 139.9, P = 3.1 \u00d7 10-10). We also identified 10 patients in additional influenza patient cohorts. Autoantibodies neutralizing type I IFNs account for \u223c5% of cases of life-threatening influenza pneumonia in patients <70 yr old.",

        "Abstract": "Examining the neutralizing capacity of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) used to treat COVID-19, as well as antibodies recovered from unvaccinated, previously vaccinated, and infected individuals, against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) remains critical to study. Here, we report on a SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 R.1 variant harboring the E484K mutation in a 281-bed psychiatric facility in New Jersey among unvaccinated inpatients and health care professionals (HCPs). A total of 81 inpatients and HCPs tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from 29 October 9 to 30 November 2020. The R.1 variant exhibits partial or complete resistance to two MAbs in clinical use, as well as 2 receptor binding domain MAbs and 4 N-terminal domain (NTD) MAbs. NTD MAbs against pseudovirus harboring single characteristic R.1 mutations highlight the role of S255F in loss of activity. Additionally, we note dampened neutralization capacity by plasma from individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or sera from vaccinated individuals. The relative resistance of the R.1 variant is likely lower than that of B.1.351 and closer to that of P.1 and B.1.526. The R.1 lineage has been reported in 47 states in the United States and 40 countries. Although high proportions exhibited symptoms (26% and 61% among patients and HCPs, respectively) and relative antibody resistance, we detected only 10 R.1 variants from over 2,900 samples (~0.34%) collected from January to October 2021. Among 3 vaccinated individuals previously infected with R.1, we observed robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and VOCs. ",

        "Abstract": "Recessive or dominant inborn errors of type I interferon (IFN) immunity can underlie critical COVID-19 pneumonia in unvaccinated adults. The risk of COVID-19 pneumonia in unvaccinated children, which is much lower than in unvaccinated adults, remains unexplained. In an international cohort of 112 children (<16 yr old) hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia, we report 12 children (10.7%) aged 1.5-13 yr with critical (7 children), severe (3), and moderate (2) pneumonia and 4 of the 15 known clinically recessive and biochemically complete inborn errors of type I IFN immunity: X-linked recessive TLR7 deficiency (7 children) and autosomal recessive IFNAR1 (1), STAT2 (1), or TYK2 (3) deficiencies. Fibroblasts deficient for IFNAR1, STAT2, or TYK2 are highly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. These 15 deficiencies were not found in 1,224 children and adults with benign SARS-CoV-2 infection without pneumonia (P = 1.2 \u00d7 10-11) and with overlapping age, sex, consanguinity, and ethnicity characteristics. Recessive complete deficiencies of type I IFN immunity may underlie \u223c10% of hospitalizations for COVID-19 pneumonia in children.",

        "Abstract": "Autosomal recessive IRF7 deficiency was previously reported in three patients with single critical influenza or COVID-19 pneumonia episodes. The patients' fibroblasts and plasmacytoid dendritic cells produced no detectable type I and III IFNs, except IFN-\u03b2. Having discovered four new patients, we describe the genetic, immunological, and clinical features of seven IRF7-deficient patients from six families and five ancestries. Five were homozygous and two were compound heterozygous for IRF7 variants. Patients typically had one episode of pulmonary viral disease. Age at onset was surprisingly broad, from 6 mo to 50 yr (mean age 29 yr). The respiratory viruses implicated included SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus. Serological analyses indicated previous infections with many common viruses. Cellular analyses revealed strong antiviral immunity and expanded populations of influenza- and SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. IRF7-deficient individuals are prone to viral infections of the respiratory tract but are otherwise healthy, potentially due to residual IFN-\u03b2 and compensatory adaptive immunity.",

        "Title": "Human genetic and immunological determinants of critical COVID-19 pneumonia.",
        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection is benign in most individuals but, in around 10% of cases, it triggers hypoxaemic COVID-19 pneumonia, which leads to critical illness in around 3% of cases. The ensuing risk of death (approximately 1%\u00a0across age and gender) doubles every five years from childhood onwards and is around 1.5 times greater in men than in women. Here we review the molecular and cellular determinants of critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Inborn errors of type I interferons\u00a0(IFNs), including autosomal TLR3 and X-chromosome-linked TLR7 deficiencies, are found in around 1-5% of patients with critical pneumonia under 60 years old, and a lower proportion in older patients. Pre-existing auto-antibodies neutralizing IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2 and/or IFN\u03c9, which are more common in men than in women, are found in approximately 15-20% of patients with critical pneumonia over 70 years old, and a lower proportion in younger patients. Thus, at least 15% of cases of critical COVID-19 pneumonia can be explained. The TLR3- and TLR7-dependent production of type I IFNs by respiratory epithelial cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, respectively, is essential for host defence against SARS-CoV-2. In ways that can depend on age and sex, insufficient type I IFN immunity in the respiratory tract during the first few days of infection may account for the spread of the virus, leading to pulmonary and systemic inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 with high transmission and immune evasion potential, the so-called variants of concern (VOC), is a major concern. We describe the early genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from vaccinated health care professionals (HCP). Our postvaccination COVID-19 symptoms-based surveillance program among HCPs in a 17-hospital network identified all vaccinated HCPs who tested positive for COVID-19 after routine screening or after self-reporting. From 1 January 2021 to 30 April 2021, 23,687 HCPs received either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. All available postvaccination SARS-CoV-2 samples and a random collection from nonvaccinated patients during the similar time frame were subjected to VOC screening and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Sixty-two percent (23,697/37,500) of HCPs received at least one vaccine dose, with 60% (22,458) fully vaccinated. We detected 138 (0.58%, 138/23,697) COVID-19 cases, 105 among partially vaccinated and 33 (0.15%, 33/22,458) among fully vaccinated. Five partially vaccinated required hospitalization, four with supplemental oxygen. VOC screening from 16 fully vaccinated HCPs identified 6 (38%) harboring N501Y and 1 (6%) with E484K polymorphisms; percentage of concurrent nonvaccinated samples was 37% (523/1,404) and 20% (284/1,394), respectively. There was an upward trend from January to April for E484K/Q (3% to 26%) and N501Y (1% to 49%). WGS analysis from vaccinated and nonvaccinated individuals indicated highly congruent phylogenies. We did not detect an increased frequency of any receptor-binding domain (RBD)/N-terminal domain (NTD) polymorphism between groups (",

        "Abstract": "Circulating autoantibodies (auto-Abs) neutralizing high concentrations (10 ng/mL, in plasma diluted 1 to 10) of IFN-\u03b1 and/or -\u03c9 are found in about 10% of patients with critical COVID-19 pneumonia, but not in subjects with asymptomatic infections. We detect auto-Abs neutralizing 100-fold lower, more physiological, concentrations of IFN-\u03b1 and/or -\u03c9 (100 pg/mL, in 1/10 dilutions of plasma) in 13.6% of 3,595 patients with critical COVID-19, including 21% of 374 patients > 80 years, and 6.5% of 522 patients with severe COVID-19. These antibodies are also detected in 18% of the 1,124 deceased patients (aged 20 days-99 years; mean: 70 years). Moreover, another 1.3% of patients with critical COVID-19 and 0.9% of the deceased patients have auto-Abs neutralizing high concentrations of IFN-\u03b2. We also show, in a sample of 34,159 uninfected subjects from the general population, that auto-Abs neutralizing high concentrations of IFN-\u03b1 and/or -\u03c9 are present in 0.18% of individuals between 18 and 69 years, 1.1% between 70 and 79 years, and 3.4% >80 years. Moreover, the proportion of subjects carrying auto-Abs neutralizing lower concentrations is greater in a subsample of 10,778 uninfected individuals: 1% of individuals <70 years, 2.3% between 70 and 80 years, and 6.3% >80 years. By contrast, auto-Abs neutralizing IFN-\u03b2 do not become more frequent with age. Auto-Abs neutralizing type I IFNs predate SARS-CoV-2 infection and sharply increase in prevalence after the age of 70 years. They account for about 20% of both critical COVID-19 cases in the over-80s, and total fatal COVID-19 cases.",

        "Title": "ALS- and FTD-associated missense mutations in TBK1 differentially disrupt mitophagy.",
        "Abstract": "TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is a multifunctional kinase with an essential role in mitophagy, the selective clearance of damaged mitochondria. More than 90 distinct mutations in TBK1 are linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto-temporal dementia, including missense mutations that disrupt the abilities of TBK1 to dimerize, associate with the mitophagy receptor optineurin (OPTN), autoactivate, or catalyze phosphorylation. We investigated how ALS-associated mutations in TBK1 affect Parkin-dependent mitophagy using imaging to dissect the molecular mechanisms involved in clearing damaged mitochondria. Some mutations cause severe dysregulation of the pathway, while others induce limited disruption. Mutations that abolish either TBK1 dimerization or kinase activity were insufficient to fully inhibit mitophagy, while mutations that reduced both dimerization and kinase activity were more disruptive. Ultimately, both TBK1 recruitment and OPTN phosphorylation at S177 are necessary for engulfment of damaged mitochondra by autophagosomal membranes. Surprisingly, we find that ULK1 activity contributes to the phosphorylation of OPTN in the presence of either wild-type or kinase-inactive TBK1. In primary neurons, TBK1 mutants induce mitochondrial stress under basal conditions; network stress is exacerbated with further mitochondrial insult. Our study further refines the model for TBK1 function in mitophagy, demonstrating that some ALS-linked mutations likely contribute to disease pathogenesis by inducing mitochondrial stress or inhibiting mitophagic flux. Other TBK1 mutations exhibited much less impact on mitophagy in our assays, suggesting that cell-type-specific effects, cumulative damage, or alternative TBK1-dependent pathways such as innate immunity and inflammation also factor into the development of ALS in affected individuals.",

        "Abstract": "Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) emerged in April 2020 in communities with high COVID-19 rates. This new condition is heterogenous but resembles Kawasaki disease (KD), a well-known but poorly understood and clinically heterogenous pediatric inflammatory condition for which weak associations have been found with a myriad of viral illnesses. Epidemiological data clearly indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is the trigger for MIS-C, which typically occurs about 1 mo after infection. These findings support the hypothesis of viral triggers for the various forms of classic KD. We further suggest that rare inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) altering the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may underlie the pathogenesis of MIS-C in some children. The discovery of monogenic IEIs underlying MIS-C would shed light on its pathogenesis, paving the way for a new genetic approach to classic KD, revisited as a heterogeneous collection of IEIs to viruses.",

In samples from the Ashkenazi Jewish population, we report that schizophrenia cases had a greater frequency of novel missense or loss of function (MisLoF) ultra-rare variants (URVs) compared to controls, and the MisLoF URV burden was inversely correlated with polygenic risk scores in cases. Characterizing 141 \"case-only\" genes (MisLoF URVs in\u00a0\u22653 cases with none in controls), the cadherin gene set was associated with schizophrenia. We\u00a0report\u00a0a recurrent case mutation in PCDHA3 that results in the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates\u00a0and failure to engage in homophilic interactions on the plasma membrane in cultured cells.\u00a0Modeling purifying selection, we demonstrate that deleterious URVs are greatly overrepresented in the Ashkenazi\u00a0population, yielding enhanced power for association studies.

        "Abstract": "Interindividual clinical variability in the course of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is vast. We report that at least 101 of 987 patients with life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia had neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies (auto-Abs) against interferon-\u03c9 (IFN-\u03c9) (13 patients), against the 13 types of IFN-\u03b1 (36), or against both (52) at the onset of critical disease; a few also had auto-Abs against the other three type I IFNs. The auto-Abs neutralize the ability of the corresponding type I IFNs to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. These auto-Abs were not found in 663 individuals with asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and were present in only 4 of 1227 healthy individuals. Patients with auto-Abs were aged 25 to 87 years and 95 of the 101 were men. A B cell autoimmune phenocopy of inborn errors of type I IFN immunity accounts for life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in at least 2.6% of women and 12.5% of men.",

We have found an enrichment in rare variants predicted to be loss-of-function (LOF) at the 13 human loci known to govern Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus in 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia relative to 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. By testing these and other rare variants at these 13 loci, we experimentally defined LOF variants underlying autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant deficiencies in 23 patients (3.5%) 17 to 77 years of age. We show that human fibroblasts with mutations affecting this circuit are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity can underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with no prior severe infection.",

        "Abstract": "During development, individual neurons extend highly branched arbors that innervate the surrounding territory, enabling the formation of appropriate synaptic connections. The clustered protocadherins (cPCDH), a family of diverse cell-surface homophilic proteins, provide each neuron with a cell specific identity required for distinguishing between self versus non-self. While only 52 unique cPcdh isoforms are encoded in the human genome, a combination of stochastic promoter choice and the formation of a protein lattice through engagement of adjacent cPCDH protein cis/trans-tetramers confer the high degree of cellular specificity required for self-recognition. Studies of mice bearing deletions of individual cPcdh gene clustees have identified deficits in circuit formation and behavior. In humans, single nucleotide variants scattered across the cPCDH locus have been identified, which associate with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. To advance our understanding of cPCDH stochastic choice and maintenance, function across cell types, and contribution to neuropsychiatric disease pathogenesis, hiPSC-based models have been developed. Ultimately, integration of human genetic data, biochemical assays, and functional studies is needed to uncover the mechanism underlying neurite repulsion, which has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders.",

        "Abstract": "The assembly of functional neural circuits in vertebrate organisms requires complex mechanisms of self-recognition and self-avoidance. Neurites (axons and dendrites) from the same neuron recognize and avoid self, but engage in synaptic interactions with other neurons. Vertebrate neural self-avoidance requires the expression of distinct repertoires of clustered Protocadherin (Pcdh) cell-surface protein isoforms, which act as cell-surface molecular barcodes that mediate highly specific homophilic self-recognition, followed by repulsion. The generation of sufficiently diverse cell-surface barcodes is achieved by the stochastic and combinatorial activation of a subset of clustered Pcdh promoters in individual neurons. This remarkable mechanism leads to the generation of enormous molecular diversity at the cell surface. Here we review recent studies showing that stochastic expression of individual Pcdh\u03b1 isoforms is accomplished through an extraordinary mechanism involving the activation of 'antisense strand' promoter within Pcdh\u03b1 'variable' exons, antisense transcription of a long non-coding RNA through the upstream 'sense strand' promoter, demethylation of this promoter, binding of the CTCF/cohesin complex and DNA looping to a distant enhancer through a mechanism of chromatin 'extrusion'.",

        "Abstract": "Stochastic activation of clustered Protocadherin (Pcdh) \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 genes generates a cell-surface identity code in individual neurons that functions in neural circuit assembly. Here, we show that Pcdh\u03b1 gene choice involves the activation of an antisense promoter located in the first exon of each Pcdh\u03b1 alternate gene. Transcription of an antisense long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) from this antisense promoter extends through the sense promoter, leading to DNA demethylation of the CTCF binding sites proximal to each promoter. Demethylation-dependent CTCF binding to both promoters facilitates cohesin-mediated DNA looping with a distal enhancer (HS5-1), locking in the transcriptional state of the chosen Pcdh\u03b1 gene. Uncoupling DNA demethylation from antisense transcription by Tet3 overexpression in mouse olfactory neurons promotes CTCF binding to all Pcdh\u03b1 promoters, resulting in proximity-biased DNA looping of the HS5-1 enhancer. Thus, antisense\u00a0transcription-mediated promoter demethylation functions as a mechanism for distance-independent enhancer/promoter DNA looping to ensure stochastic Pcdh\u03b1 promoter choice.",

        "Abstract": "Large-scale sequencing efforts in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have implicated novel genes using gene-based collapsing methods. However, pathogenic mutations may be concentrated in specific genic regions. To address this, we developed two collapsing strategies: One focuses rare variation collapsing on homology-based protein domains as the unit for collapsing, and the other is a gene-level approach that, unlike standard methods, leverages existing evidence of purifying selection against missense variation on said domains. The application of these two collapsing methods to 3093 ALS cases and 8186 controls of European ancestry, and also 3239 cases and 11,808 controls of diversified populations, pinpoints risk regions of ALS genes, including ",

        "Abstract": "The ability of neurites of individual neurons to distinguish between themselves and neurites from other neurons and to avoid self (self-avoidance) plays a key role in neural circuit assembly in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Similarly, when individual neurons of the same type project into receptive fields of the brain, they must avoid each other to maximize target coverage (tiling). Counterintuitively, these processes are driven by highly specific homophilic interactions between cell surface proteins that lead to neurite repulsion rather than adhesion. Among these proteins in vertebrates are the clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs), and key to their function is the generation of enormous cell surface structural diversity. Here we review recent advances in understanding how a Pcdh cell surface code is generated by stochastic promoter choice; how this code is amplified and read by homophilic interactions between Pcdh complexes at the surface of neurons; and, finally, how the Pcdh code is translated to cellular function, which mediates self-avoidance and tiling and thus plays a central role in the development of complex neural circuits. Not surprisingly, Pcdh mutations that diminish homophilic interactions lead to wiring defects and abnormal behavior in mice, and sequence variants in the Pcdh gene cluster are associated with autism spectrum disorders in family-based genetic studies in humans.",

This one-step enrichment procedure captures s4U-RNA by using highly efficient methane thiosulfonate (MTS) chemistry in an immobilized format. Like solution-based methods, this solid-phase enrichment can distinguish mature RNAs (mRNA) with differential stability, and can be used to reveal transient RNAs such as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) from short metabolic labeling. Most importantly, the efficiency of this solid-phase chemistry made possible the first large scale measurements of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) elongation rates in mouse cortical neurons. Thus, our approach provides the means to study regulation of RNA metabolism in specific tissue contexts as a means to better understand gene expression in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "To identify novel genes associated with ALS, we undertook two lines of investigation. We carried out a genome-wide association study comparing 20,806 ALS cases and 59,804 controls. Independently, we performed a rare variant burden analysis comparing 1,138 index familial ALS cases and 19,494 controls. Through both approaches, we identified kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) as a novel gene associated with ALS. Interestingly, mutations predominantly in the N-terminal motor domain of KIF5A are causative for two neurodegenerative diseases: hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG10) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 (CMT2). In contrast, ALS-associated mutations are primarily located at the C-terminal cargo-binding tail domain and patients harboring loss-of-function mutations displayed an extended survival relative to typical ALS cases. Taken together, these results broaden the phenotype spectrum resulting from mutations in KIF5A and strengthen the role of cytoskeletal defects in the pathogenesis of ALS.",

Recent structural, biophysical, computational, and cell-based studies on protocadherin structure and function have led to a compelling molecular model for the barcoding mechanism. Protocadherin isoforms assemble into promiscuous cis-dimeric recognition units and mediate cell-cell recognition through homophilic trans-interactions. Each recognition unit is composed of two arms extending from the membrane proximal EC6 domains. A cis-dimeric recognition unit with each arm coding adhesive trans homophilic specificity can generate a zipper-like assembly that in turn suggests a chain termination mechanism for self-vs-non-self-discrimination among vertebrate neurons.",

Understanding of cell fate has been advanced by studying single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) but is limited by the assumptions of current analytic methods regarding the structure of data. We present single-cell topological data analysis (scTDA), an algorithm for topology-based computational analyses to study temporal, unbiased transcriptional regulation. Unlike other methods, scTDA is a nonlinear, model-independent, unsupervised statistical framework that can characterize transient cellular states. We applied scTDA to the analysis of murine embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation in vitro in response to inducers of motor neuron differentiation. scTDA resolved asynchrony and continuity in cellular identity over time and identified four transient states (pluripotent, precursor, progenitor, and fully differentiated cells) based on changes in stage-dependent combinations of transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). scTDA can be applied to study asynchronous cellular responses to either developmental cues or environmental perturbations.",

        "Abstract": "Actin, spectrin, and associated molecules form a periodic, submembrane cytoskeleton in the axons of neurons. For a better understanding of this membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), it is important to address how prevalent this structure is in different neuronal types, different subcellular compartments, and across different animal species. Here, we investigated the organization of spectrin in a variety of neuronal- and glial-cell types. We observed the presence of MPS in all of the tested neuronal types cultured from mouse central and peripheral nervous systems, including excitatory and inhibitory neurons from several brain regions, as well as sensory and motor neurons. Quantitative analyses show that MPS is preferentially formed in axons in all neuronal types tested here: Spectrin shows a long-range, periodic distribution throughout all axons but appears periodic only in a small fraction of dendrites, typically in the form of isolated patches in subregions of these dendrites. As in dendrites, we also observed patches of periodic spectrin structures in a small fraction of glial-cell processes in four types of glial cells cultured from rodent tissues. Interestingly, despite its strong presence in the axonal shaft, MPS is disrupted in most presynaptic boutons but is present in an appreciable fraction of dendritic spine necks, including some projecting from dendrites where such a periodic structure is not observed in the shaft. Finally, we found that spectrin is capable of adopting a similar periodic organization in neurons of a variety of animal species, including Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, Gallus gallus, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens.",

        "Abstract": "Clustered protocadherin proteins (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-Pcdhs) provide a high level of cell-surface diversity to individual vertebrate neurons, engaging in highly specific homophilic interactions to mediate important roles in mammalian neural circuit development. How Pcdhs bind homophilically through their extracellular cadherin (EC) domains among dozens of highly similar isoforms has not been determined. Here, we report crystal structures for extracellular regions from four mouse Pcdh isoforms (\u03b14, \u03b17, \u03b26, and \u03b28), revealing a canonical head-to-tail interaction mode for homophilic trans dimers comprising primary intermolecular EC1:EC4 and EC2:EC3 interactions. A subset of trans interface residues exhibit isoform-specific conservation, suggesting roles in recognition specificity. Mutation of these residues, along with trans-interacting partner residues, altered the specificities of Pcdh interactions. Together, these data show how sequence variation among Pcdh isoforms encodes their diverse strict homophilic recognition specificities, which are required for their key roles in neural circuit assembly.",

        "Abstract": "Self-avoidance, a process preventing interactions of axons and dendrites from the same neuron during development, is mediated in vertebrates through the stochastic single-neuron expression of clustered protocadherin protein isoforms. Extracellular cadherin (EC) domains mediate isoform-specific homophilic binding between cells, conferring cell recognition through a poorly understood mechanism. Here, we report crystal structures for the EC1-EC3 domain regions from four protocadherin isoforms representing the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 subfamilies. All are rod shaped and monomeric in solution. Biophysical measurements, cell aggregation assays, and computational docking reveal that trans binding between cells depends on the EC1-EC4 domains, which interact in an antiparallel orientation. We also show that the EC6 domains are required for the formation of cis-dimers. Overall, our results are consistent with a model in which protocadherin cis-dimers engage in a head-to-tail interaction between EC1-EC4 domains from apposed cell surfaces, possibly forming a zipper-like protein assembly, and thus providing a size-dependent self-recognition mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "CTCF and the associated cohesin complex play a central role in insulator function and higher-order chromatin organization of mammalian genomes. Recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of CTCF-binding sites (CBSs) and chromatin loops. To test the functional significance of this observation, we combined CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic-DNA-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of CBSs determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (Pcdh) and \u03b2-globin as model genes. Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity. These findings reveal how 3D chromosome architecture can be encoded by linear genome sequences.",

        "Abstract": "We report that mice lacking the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U) in the heart develop lethal dilated cardiomyopathy and display numerous defects in cardiac pre-mRNA splicing. Mutant hearts have disorganized cardiomyocytes, impaired contractility, and abnormal excitation-contraction coupling activities. RNA-seq analyses of Hnrnpu mutant hearts revealed extensive defects in alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs encoding proteins known to be critical for normal heart development and function, including Titin and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (Camk2d). Loss of hnRNP U expression in cardiomyocytes also leads to aberrant splicing of the pre-mRNA encoding the excitation-contraction coupling component Junctin. We found that the protein product of an alternatively spliced Junctin isoform is N-glycosylated at a specific asparagine site that is required for interactions with specific protein partners. Our findings provide conclusive evidence for the essential role of hnRNP U in heart development and function and in the regulation of alternative splicing.",

        "Abstract": "Astrocytes contribute to the maintenance of the health and function of the central nervous system (CNS). Thus, it is not surprising that these multifunctional cells have been implicated in the onset and progression of several neurodegenerative diseases. The involvement of astrocytes in the neuropathology of these diseases is likely a consequence of both the loss of normal homeostatic functions and gain of toxic functions. Intracellular aggregates in astrocytes are a common feature of various neurodegenerative diseases, and these aggregates perturb normal astrocytic functions in ways that can be harmful to neuronal viability. Here, we review the role of astrocytes in neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on their dysfunction in Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).",

We report the results of a moderate-scale sequencing study aimed at increasing the number of genes known to contribute to predisposition for ALS. We performed whole-exome sequencing of 2869 ALS patients and 6405 controls. Several known ALS genes were found to be associated, and TBK1 (the gene encoding TANK-binding kinase 1) was identified as an ALS gene. TBK1 is known to bind to and phosphorylate a number of proteins involved in innate immunity and autophagy, including optineurin (OPTN) and p62 (SQSTM1/sequestosome), both of which have also been implicated in ALS. These observations reveal a key role of the autophagic pathway in ALS and suggest specific targets for therapeutic intervention.",

        "Abstract": "The major cell classes of the brain differ in their developmental processes, metabolism, signaling, and function. To better understand the functions and interactions of the cell types that comprise these classes, we acutely purified representative populations of neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, newly formed oligodendrocytes, myelinating oligodendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, and pericytes from mouse cerebral cortex. We generated a transcriptome database for these eight cell types by RNA sequencing and used a sensitive algorithm to detect alternative splicing events in each cell type. Bioinformatic analyses identified thousands of new cell type-enriched genes and splicing isoforms that will provide novel markers for cell identification, tools for genetic manipulation, and insights into the biology of the brain. For example, our data provide clues as to how neurons and astrocytes differ in their ability to dynamically regulate glycolytic flux and lactate generation attributable to unique splicing of PKM2, the gene encoding the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. This dataset will provide a powerful new resource for understanding the development and function of the brain. To ensure the widespread distribution of these datasets, we have created a user-friendly website (http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html) that provides a platform for analyzing and comparing transciption and alternative splicing profiles for various cell classes in the brain.",

        "Abstract": "Individual mammalian neurons stochastically express distinct repertoires of \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 protocadherin (Pcdh) proteins, which function in neural circuit assembly. We report that all three subfamilies of clustered Pcdhs can engage in specific homophilic interactions, that cell surface delivery of Pcdh\u03b1 isoforms requires cis interactions with other Pcdhs, and that the extracellular cadherin domain EC6 plays a critical role in this process. Examination of homophilic interactions between specific combinations of multiple Pcdh isoforms revealed that Pcdh combinatorial recognition specificities depend on the identity of all of the expressed isoforms. A single mismatched Pcdh isoform can interfere with these combinatorial homophilic interactions. A theoretical analysis reveals that assembly of Pcdh isoforms into multimeric recognition units and the observed tolerance for mismatched isoforms can generate cell surface diversity sufficient for single-cell identity. However, the competing demands of nonself discrimination and self-recognition place limitations on the mechanisms by which homophilic recognition units can function.",

        "Title": "Allele-specific knockdown of ALS-associated mutant TDP-43 in neural stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells.",
        "Abstract": "TDP-43 is found in cytoplasmic inclusions in 95% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 60% of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Approximately 4% of familial ALS is caused by mutations in TDP-43. The majority of these mutations are found in the glycine-rich domain, including the variant M337V, which is one of the most common mutations in TDP-43. In order to investigate the use of allele-specific RNA interference (RNAi) as a potential therapeutic tool, we designed and screened a set of siRNAs that specifically target TDP-43(M337V) mutation. Two siRNA specifically silenced the M337V mutation in HEK293T cells transfected with GFP-TDP-43(wt) or GFP-TDP-43(M337V) or TDP-43 C-terminal fragments counterparts. C-terminal TDP-43 transfected cells show an increase of cytosolic inclusions, which are decreased after allele-specific siRNA in M337V cells. We then investigated the effects of one of these allele-specific siRNAs in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from an ALS patient carrying the M337V mutation. These lines showed a two-fold increase in cytosolic TDP-43 compared to the control. Following transfection with the allele-specific siRNA, cytosolic TDP-43 was reduced by 30% compared to cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA. We conclude that RNA interference can be used to selectively target the TDP-43(M337V) allele in mammalian and patient cells, thus demonstrating the potential for using RNA interference as a therapeutic tool for ALS.",

        "Abstract": "The RNA-binding protein TDP-43 regulates RNA metabolism at multiple levels, including transcription, RNA splicing, and mRNA stability. TDP-43 is a\u00a0major component of the cytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and some types of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The importance of TDP-43 in disease is underscored by the fact that dominant missense mutations are sufficient to cause disease, although the role of TDP-43 in pathogenesis is unknown. Here we show that TDP-43 forms cytoplasmic mRNP granules that\u00a0undergo bidirectional, microtubule-dependent transport in neurons in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo and facilitate delivery of target mRNA to distal neuronal compartments. TDP-43 mutations impair this mRNA transport function in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro, including in stem cell-derived motor neurons from ALS patients bearing any one of three different TDP-43 ALS-causing mutations. Thus, TDP-43 mutations that cause ALS lead to partial loss of a novel cytoplasmic function of TDP-43.",

        "Abstract": "The majority of vertebrate protocadherin (Pcdh) genes are clustered in a single genomic locus, and this remarkable genomic organization is highly conserved from teleosts to humans. These clustered Pcdhs are differentially expressed in individual neurons, they engage in homophilic trans-interactions as multimers and they are required for diverse neurodevelopmental processes, including neurite self-avoidance. Here, we provide a concise overview of the molecular and cellular biology of clustered Pcdhs, highlighting how they generate single cell diversity in the vertebrate nervous system and how such diversity may be used in neural circuit assembly.",

        "Abstract": "Microglia are resident immune cells of the CNS that are activated by infection, neuronal injury, and inflammation. Here, we utilize flow cytometry and deep RNA sequencing of acutely isolated spinal cord microglia to define their activation in\u00a0vivo. Analysis of resting microglia identified 29 genes that distinguish microglia from other CNS cells and peripheral macrophages/monocytes. We then analyzed molecular changes in microglia during neurodegenerative disease activation using the SOD1(G93A) mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We found that SOD1(G93A) microglia are not derived from infiltrating monocytes, and that both potentially neuroprotective and toxic factors, including Alzheimer's disease genes, are concurrently upregulated. Mutant microglia differed from SOD1(WT), lipopolysaccharide-activated microglia, and M1/M2 macrophages, defining an ALS-specific phenotype. Concurrent messenger RNA/fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed posttranscriptional regulation of microglia surface receptors and T\u00a0cell-associated changes in the transcriptome. These results provide insights into microglia biology and establish a resource for future studies of neuroinflammation.",

        "Abstract": "Imaging single fluorescent proteins in living mammalian cells is challenged by out-of-focus fluorescence excitation. To reduce out-of-focus fluorescence we developed reflected light-sheet microscopy (RLSM), a fluorescence microscopy method allowing selective plane illumination throughout the nuclei of living mammalian cells. A thin light sheet parallel to the imaging plane and close to the sample surface is generated by reflecting an elliptical laser beam incident from the top by 90\u00b0 with a small mirror. The thin light sheet allows for an increased signal-to-background ratio superior to that in previous illumination schemes and enables imaging of single fluorescent proteins with up to 100-Hz time resolution. We demonstrated the single-molecule sensitivity of RLSM by measuring the DNA-bound fraction of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and determining the residence times on DNA of various oligomerization states and mutants of GR and estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER), which permitted us to resolve different modes of DNA binding of GR. We demonstrated two-color single-molecule imaging by observing the spatiotemporal colocalization of two different protein pairs. Our single-molecule measurements and statistical analysis revealed dynamic properties of transcription factors.",

        "Abstract": "Tank-binding kinase I (TBK1) plays a key role in the innate immune system by integrating signals from pattern-recognition receptors. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structures of inhibitor-bound inactive and active TBK1 determined to 2.6 \u00c5 and 4.0 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. The structures reveal a compact dimer made up of trimodular subunits containing an N-terminal kinase domain (KD), a ubiquitin-like domain (ULD), and an \u03b1-helical scaffold dimerization domain (SDD). Activation rearranges the KD into an active conformation while maintaining the overall dimer conformation. Low-resolution SAXS studies reveal that the missing C-terminal domain (CTD) extends away from the main body of the kinase dimer. Mutants that interfere with TBK1 dimerization show significantly reduced trans-autophosphorylation but retain the ability to bind adaptor proteins through the CTD. Our results provide detailed insights into the architecture of TBK1 and the molecular mechanism of activation.",

        "Abstract": "Glial proliferation and activation are associated with disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar dementia. In this study, we describe a unique platform to address the question of cell autonomy in transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) proteinopathies. We generated functional astroglia from human induced pluripotent stem cells carrying an ALS-causing TDP-43 mutation and show that mutant astrocytes exhibit increased levels of TDP-43, subcellular mislocalization of TDP-43, and decreased cell survival. We then performed coculture experiments to evaluate the effects of M337V astrocytes on the survival of wild-type and M337V TDP-43 motor neurons, showing that mutant TDP-43 astrocytes do not adversely affect survival of cocultured neurons. These observations reveal a significant and previously unrecognized glial cell-autonomous pathological phenotype associated with a pathogenic mutation in TDP-43 and show that TDP-43 proteinopathies do not display an astrocyte non-cell-autonomous component in cell culture, as previously described for SOD1 ALS. This study highlights the utility of induced pluripotent stem cell-based in vitro disease models to investigate mechanisms of disease in ALS and other TDP-43 proteinopathies.",

Although the underlying disease mechanisms remain unknown, glial cells have been implicated in ALS disease progression. Here, we examine the effects of glial cell/motor neuron interactions on gene expression using the hSOD1(G93A) (the G93A allele of the human superoxide dismutase gene) mouse model of ALS. We detect striking cell autonomous and nonautonomous changes in gene expression in cocultured motor neurons and glia, revealing that the two cell types profoundly affect each other. In addition, we found a remarkable concordance between the cell culture data and expression profiles of whole spinal cords and acutely isolated spinal cord cells during disease progression in the G93A mouse model, providing validation of the cell culture approach. Bioinformatics analyses identified changes in the expression of specific genes and signaling pathways that may contribute to motor neuron degeneration in ALS, among which are TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways.",

        "Abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells are a promising source of differentiated cells for developmental studies, cell transplantation, disease modeling, and drug testing. However, their widespread use even for intensely studied cell types like spinal motor neurons is hindered by the long duration and low yields of existing protocols for in vitro differentiation and by the molecular heterogeneity of the populations generated. We report a combination of small molecules that within 3 weeks induce motor neurons at up to 50% abundance and with defined subtype identities of relevance to neurodegenerative disease. Despite their accelerated differentiation, motor neurons expressed combinations of HB9, ISL1, and column-specific markers that mirror those observed in vivo in human embryonic spinal cord. They also exhibited spontaneous and induced activity, and projected axons toward muscles when grafted into developing chick spinal cord. Strikingly, this novel protocol preferentially generates motor neurons expressing markers of limb-innervating lateral motor column motor neurons (FOXP1(+)/LHX3(-)). Access to high-yield cultures of human limb-innervating motor neuron subtypes will facilitate in-depth study of motor neuron subtype-specific properties, disease modeling, and development of large-scale cell-based screening assays.",

        "Abstract": "The closely linked human protocadherin (Pcdh) \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 gene clusters encode 53 distinct protein isoforms, which are expressed in a combinatorial manner to generate enormous diversity on the surface of individual neurons. This diversity is a consequence of stochastic promoter choice and alternative pre-mRNA processing. Here, we show that Pcdh\u03b1 promoter choice is achieved by DNA looping between two downstream transcriptional enhancers and individual promoters driving the expression of alternate Pcdh\u03b1 isoforms. In addition, we show that this DNA looping requires specific binding of the CTCF/cohesin complex to two symmetrically aligned binding sites in both the transcriptionally active promoters and in one of the enhancers. These findings have important implications regarding enhancer/promoter interactions in the generation of complex Pcdh cell surface codes for the establishment of neuronal identity and self-avoidance in individual neurons.",

        "Abstract": "The genome-wide identification of pairs of interacting proteins is an important step in the elucidation of cell regulatory mechanisms. Much of our present knowledge derives from high-throughput techniques such as the yeast two-hybrid assay and affinity purification, as well as from manual curation of experiments on individual systems. A variety of computational approaches based, for example, on sequence homology, gene co-expression and phylogenetic profiles, have also been developed for the genome-wide inference of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Yet comparative studies suggest that the development of accurate and complete repertoires of PPIs is still in its early stages. Here we show that three-dimensional structural information can be used to predict PPIs with an accuracy and coverage that are superior to predictions based on non-structural evidence. Moreover, an algorithm, termed PrePPI, which combines structural information with other functional clues, is comparable in accuracy to high-throughput experiments, yielding over 30,000 high-confidence interactions for yeast and over 300,000 for human. Experimental tests of a number of predictions demonstrate the ability of the PrePPI algorithm to identify unexpected PPIs of considerable biological interest. The surprising effectiveness of three-dimensional structural information can be attributed to the use of homology models combined with the exploitation of both close and remote geometric relationships between proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in the RNA binding protein FUS cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal adult motor neuron disease. Decreased expression of SMN causes the fatal childhood motor neuron disorder spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The SMN complex localizes in both the cytoplasm and nuclear Gems, and loss of Gems is a cellular hallmark of fibroblasts in patients with SMA. Here, we report that FUS associates with the SMN complex, mediated by U1 snRNP and by direct interactions between FUS and SMN. Functionally, we show that FUS is required for Gem formation in HeLa cells, and expression of FUS containing a severe ALS-causing mutation (R495X) also results in Gem loss. Strikingly, a reduction in Gems is observed in ALS patient fibroblasts expressing either mutant FUS or TDP-43, another ALS-causing protein that interacts with FUS. The physical and functional interactions among SMN, FUS, TDP-43, and Gems indicate that ALS and SMA share a biochemical pathway, providing strong support for the view that these motor neuron diseases are related.",

        "Abstract": "Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of many neurological disorders has been greatly enhanced by the discovery of mutations in genes linked to familial forms of these diseases. These have facilitated the generation of cell and animal models that can be used to understand the underlying molecular pathology. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the use of patient-derived cells, due to the development of induced pluripotent stem cells and their subsequent differentiation into neurons and glia. Access to patient cell lines carrying the relevant mutations is a limiting factor for many centres wishing to pursue this research. We have therefore generated an open-access collection of fibroblast lines from patients carrying mutations linked to neurological disease. These cell lines have been deposited in the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Repository at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research and can be requested by any research group for use in in vitro disease modelling. There are currently 71 mutation-defined cell lines available for request from a wide range of neurological disorders and this collection will be continually expanded. This represents a significant resource that will advance the use of patient cells as disease models by the scientific community.",

        "Abstract": "We have found that the \u03b32 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor (\u03b32-GABA(A)R) specifically interacts with protocadherin-\u03b3C5 (Pcdh-\u03b3C5) in the rat brain. The interaction occurs between the large intracellular loop of the \u03b32-GABA(A)R and the cytoplasmic domain of Pcdh-\u03b3C5. In brain extracts, Pcdh-\u03b3C5 coimmunoprecipitates with GABA(A)Rs. In cotransfected HEK293 cells, Pcdh-\u03b3C5 promotes the transfer of \u03b32-GABA(A)R to the cell surface. We have previously shown that, in cultured hippocampal neurons, endogenous Pcdh-\u03b3C5 forms clusters, some of which associate with GABAergic synapses. Overexpression of Pcdh-\u03b3C5 in hippocampal neurons increases the density of \u03b32-GABA(A)R clusters but has no significant effect on the number of GABAergic contacts that these neurons receive, indicating that Pcdh-\u03b3C5 is not synaptogenic. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of Pcdh-\u03b3C5 enhanced its surface expression but decreased the association with both \u03b32-GABA(A)R clusters and presynaptic GABAergic contacts. Cultured hippocampal neurons from the Pcdh-\u03b3 triple C-type isoform knock-out (TCKO) mouse (Pcdhg(tcko/tcko)) showed plenty of GABAergic synaptic contacts, although their density was reduced compared with sister cultures from wild-type and heterozygous mice. Knocking down Pcdh-\u03b3C5 expression with shRNA decreased \u03b32-GABA(A)R cluster density and GABAergic innervation. The results indicate that, although Pcdh-\u03b3C5 is not essential for GABAergic synapse formation or GABA(A)R clustering, (1) Pcdh-\u03b3C5 regulates the surface expression of GABA(A)Rs via cis-cytoplasmic interaction with \u03b32-GABA(A)R, and (2) Pcdh-\u03b3C5 plays a role in the stabilization and maintenance of some GABAergic synapses.",

        "Abstract": "The mammalian Protocadherin (Pcdh) alpha, beta, and gamma gene clusters encode a large family of cadherin-like transmembrane proteins that are differentially expressed in individual neurons. The 22 isoforms of the Pcdhg gene cluster are diversified into A-, B-, and C-types, and the C-type isoforms differ from all other clustered Pcdhs in sequence and expression. Here, we show that mice lacking the three C-type isoforms are phenotypically indistinguishable from the Pcdhg null mutants, displaying virtually identical cellular and synaptic alterations resulting from neuronal apoptosis. By contrast, mice lacking three A-type isoforms exhibit no detectable phenotypes. Remarkably, however, genetically blocking apoptosis rescues the neonatal lethality of the C-type isoform knockouts, but not that of the Pcdhg null mutants. We conclude that the role of the Pcdhg gene cluster in neuronal survival is primarily, if not specifically, mediated by its C-type isoforms, whereas a separate role essential for postnatal development, likely in neuronal wiring, requires isoform diversity.",

        "Title": "Protocadherins mediate dendritic self-avoidance in the mammalian nervous system.",
        "Abstract": "Dendritic arborizations of many neurons are patterned by a process called self-avoidance, in which branches arising from a single neuron repel each other. By minimizing gaps and overlaps within the arborization, self-avoidance facilitates complete coverage of a neuron\u2019s territory by its neurites. Remarkably, some neurons that display self-avoidance interact freely with other neurons of the same subtype, implying that they discriminate self from non-self. Here we demonstrate roles for the clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) in dendritic self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination. The Pcdh locus encodes 58 related cadherin-like transmembrane proteins, at least some of which exhibit isoform-specific homophilic adhesion in heterologous cells and are expressed stochastically and combinatorially in single neurons. Deletion of all 22 Pcdh genes in the mouse \u03b3-subcluster (Pcdhg genes) disrupts self-avoidance of dendrites in retinal starburst amacrine cells (SACs) and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Further genetic analysis of SACs showed that Pcdhg proteins act cell-autonomously during development, and that replacement of the 22 Pcdhg proteins with a single isoform restores self-avoidance. Moreover, expression of the same single isoform in all SACs decreases interactions among dendrites of neighbouring SACs (heteroneuronal interactions). These results suggest that homophilic Pcdhg interactions between sibling neurites (isoneuronal interactions) generate a repulsive signal that leads to self-avoidance. In this model, heteroneuronal interactions are normally permitted because dendrites seldom encounter a matched set of Pcdhg proteins unless they emanate from the same soma. In many respects, our results mirror those reported for Dscam1 (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule) in Drosophila: this complex gene encodes thousands of recognition molecules that exhibit stochastic expression and isoform-specific interactions, and mediate both self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination. Thus, although insect Dscam and vertebrate Pcdh proteins share no sequence homology, they seem to underlie similar strategies for endowing neurons with distinct molecular identities and patterning their arborizations.",

        "Title": "Role of CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin in the generation of single-cell diversity of protocadherin-\u03b1 gene expression.",
        "Abstract": "Extraordinary single-cell diversity is generated in the vertebrate nervous system by the combinatorial expression of the clustered protocadherin genes (Pcdh\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -\u03b3). This diversity is generated by a combination of stochastic promoter choice and alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Here we show that both the insulator-binding protein CTCF and the cohesin complex subunit Rad21 bind to two highly conserved DNA sequences, the first within and the second downstream of transcriptionally active Pcdh\u03b1 promoters. Both CTCF and Rad21 bind to these sites in vitro and in vivo, this binding directly correlates with alternative isoform expression, and knocking down CTCF expression reduces alternative isoform expression. Remarkably, a similarly spaced pair of CTCF/Rad21 binding sites was identified within a distant enhancer element (HS5-1), which is required for normal levels of alternative isoform expression. We also identify an additional, unique regulatory role for cohesin, as Rad21 binds to another enhancer (HS7) independently of CTCF, and knockdown of Rad21 reduces expression of the constitutive, biallelically expressed Pcdh\u03b1 isoforms \u03b1c1 and \u03b1c2. We propose that CTCF and the cohesin complex initiate and maintain Pcdh\u03b1 promoter choice by mediating interactions between Pcdh\u03b1 promoters and enhancers.",

        "Abstract": "Transactive response DNA-binding (TDP-43) protein is the dominant disease protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and a subgroup of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). Identification of mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 (TARDBP) in familial ALS confirms a mechanistic link between misaccumulation of TDP-43 and neurodegeneration and provides an opportunity to study TDP-43 proteinopathies in human neurons generated from patient fibroblasts by using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Here, we report the generation of iPSCs that carry the TDP-43 M337V mutation and their differentiation into neurons and functional motor neurons. Mutant neurons had elevated levels of soluble and detergent-resistant TDP-43 protein, decreased survival in longitudinal studies, and increased vulnerability to antagonism of the PI3K pathway. We conclude that expression of physiological levels of TDP-43 in human neurons is sufficient to reveal a mutation-specific cell-autonomous phenotype and strongly supports this approach for the study of disease mechanisms and for drug screening.",

        "Abstract": "Virus infection of mammalian cells induces the production of high levels of type I interferons (IFN\u03b1 and \u03b2), cytokines that orchestrate antiviral innate and adaptive immunity. Previous studies have shown that only a fraction of the infected cells produce IFN. However, the mechanisms responsible for this stochastic expression are poorly understood. Here we report an in depth analysis of IFN-expressing and non-expressing mouse cells infected with Sendai virus. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts in which an internal ribosome entry site/yellow fluorescent protein gene was inserted downstream from the endogenous IFN\u03b2 gene were used to distinguish between the two cell types, and they were isolated from each other using fluorescence-activated cell sorting methods. Analysis of the separated cells revealed that stochastic IFN\u03b2 expression is a consequence of cell-to-cell variability in the levels and/or activities of limiting components at every level of the virus induction process, ranging from viral replication and expression, to the sensing of viral RNA by host factors, to activation of the signaling pathway, to the levels of activated transcription factors. We propose that this highly complex stochastic IFN\u03b2 gene expression evolved to optimize both the level and distribution of type I IFNs in response to virus infection.",

        "Abstract": "Virus infection induces the production of type I and type II interferons (IFN-I and IFN-II), cytokines that mediate the antiviral response. IFN-I (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) induces the assembly of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), a multimeric transcriptional activation complex composed of STAT1, STAT2, and IFN regulatory factor 9. IFN-II (IFN-\u03b3) induces the homodimerization of STAT1 to form the gamma-activated factor (GAF) complex. ISGF3 and GAF bind specifically to unique regulatory DNA sequences located upstream of IFN-I- and IFN-II-inducible genes, respectively, and activate the expression of distinct sets of antiviral genes. The balance between type I and type II IFN pathways plays a critical role in orchestrating the innate and adaptive immune systems. Here, we show that the phosphorylation of STAT1 by I\u03baB kinase epsilon (IKK\u03b5) inhibits STAT1 homodimerization, and thus assembly of GAF, but does not disrupt ISGF3 formation. Therefore, virus and/or IFN-I activation of IKK\u03b5 suppresses GAF-dependent transcription and promotes ISGF3-dependent transcription. In the absence of IKK\u03b5, GAF-dependent transcription is enhanced at the expense of ISGF3-mediated transcription, rendering cells less resistant to infection. We conclude that IKK\u03b5 plays a critical role in regulating the balance between the IFN-I and IFN-II signaling pathways.",

        "Abstract": "The mouse protocadherin (Pcdh) -\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -\u03b3 gene clusters encode more than 50 protein isoforms, the combinatorial expression of which generates vast single-cell diversity in the brain. At present, the mechanisms by which this diversity is expressed are not understood. Here we show that two transcriptional enhancer elements, HS5-1 and HS7, play a critical role in Pcdh\u03b1 gene expression in mice. We show that the HS5-1 element functions as an enhancer in neurons and a silencer in nonneuronal cells. The enhancer activity correlates with the binding of zinc finger DNA binding protein CTCF to the target promoters, and the silencer activity requires the binding of the REST/NRSF repressor complex in nonneuronal cells. Thus, the HS5-1 element functions as a neuron-specific enhancer and nonneuronal cell repressor. In contrast, the HS7 element functions as a Pcdh\u03b1 cluster-wide transcription enhancer element. These studies reveal a complex organization of regulatory elements required for generating single cell Pcdh diversity.",

        "Title": "Negative regulation of interferon-\u03b2 gene expression during acute and persistent virus infections.",
        "Abstract": "The production of type I interferons (IFNs) in response to viral infections is critical for antiviral immunity. However, IFN production is transient, and continued expression can lead to inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying the negative regulation of IFN expression could lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to the treatment of these diseases. We report that the transcription factor IRF3 plays a central role in the negative regulation of interferon-\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2) expression during both acute and persistent (chronic) virus infections. We show that the degradation of IRF3 during acute infections, rather than the activation of transcriptional repressors, leads to the down regulation of IFN\u03b2 expression. We also show that the block to IFN\u03b2 expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that are persistently infected with Sendai virus (SeV) correlates with the absence of transcriptionally active IRF3. Remarkably, ongoing protein synthesis and viral replication are required to maintain repression of the IFN\u03b2 gene in persistently infected cells, as the gene can be activated by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, or by the antiviral drug ribavirin. Finally, we show that the SeV V protein inhibits IRF3 activity in persistently infected cells. Thus, in conjunction with the known interference with STAT1 by the SeV C protein, both IFN activation and its signaling pathways are blocked in persistently infected cells. We conclude that the transcription factor IRF3 is targeted for turnover and inactivation through distinct mechanisms from both the host cells and virus, leading to the inhibition of IFN\u03b2 gene expression during acute and persistent viral infections. These observations show that IRF3 plays a critical role, not only in the activation of the IFN\u03b2 gene, but also in the controlling the duration of its expression. (284 words).",

Cardiac glycosides increase the intracellular sodium concentration, which appears to inhibit the ATPase activity of the RNA sensor RIG-I, an essential and early component in the IFN\u03b2 activation pathway. This, in turn, prevents the activation of the critical transcription factors IRF3 and NF\u03baB. Bufalin inhibition can be overcome by expressing a drug-resistant variant of the sodium pump and knocking down the pump by short hairpin RNA inhibits IFN\u03b2 expression. Thus, bufalin acts exclusively through the sodium pump. We also show that bufalin inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling, at least in part by interfering with the nuclear translocation of NF\u03baB. These findings suggest that bufalin could be used to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in which IFN or TNF are hyperactivated.",

These proteins contain six cadherin-like extracellular domains, and proteolysis of Pcdh\u03b1 and Pcdh\u03b3 by the \u03b3-secretase complex releases their intracellular domains into the cytoplasm where they may function locally and/or enter the nucleus and affect gene expression. Thus, cleavage of Pcdhs may function to link intercellular contacts and intracellular signaling. Here we report that shedding of the Pcdh\u03b1 extracellular domain and subsequent processing by \u03b3-secretase require endocytosis and that Pcdhs interact with the regulator of vesicular sorting ESCRT-0 in undifferentiated cells. We also find that the accumulation of Pcdh cleavage products is regulated during development. Differentiation leads to an increase in the interactions between Pcdh proteins and a decrease in the accumulation of cleavage products. We conclude that Pcdh processing requires endocytosis and that the level of cleavage products is regulated during neuronal differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "The clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) are a large family of cadherin-like transmembrane proteins expressed in the nervous system. Stochastic expression of Pcdh genes and alternative splicing of their pre-mRNAs have the potential to generate enormous protein diversity at the cell surface of neurons. At present, the regulation and function of Pcdh proteins are largely unknown. Here, we show that Pcdhs form a heteromeric signaling complex(es), consisting of multiple Pcdh isoforms, receptor tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, and cell adhesion molecules. In particular, we find that the receptor tyrosine kinase rearranged during transformation (Ret) binds to Pcdhs in differentiated neuroblastoma cells and is required for stabilization and differentiation-induced phosphorylation of Pcdh proteins. In addition, the Ret ligand glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor induces phosphorylation of Pcdhgamma in motor neurons and phosphorylation of Pcdhalpha and Pcdhgamma in sympathetic neurons. Conversely, Pcdh proteins are also required for the stabilization of activated Ret in neuroblastoma cells and sympathetic ganglia. Thus, Pcdhs and Ret are functional components of a phosphorylation-dependent signaling complex.",

        "Abstract": "The Toll signaling pathway is required for the innate immune response against fungi and Gram-positive bacteria in Drosophila. Here we show that the endosomal proteins Myopic (Mop) and Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) are required for the activation of the Toll signaling pathway. This requirement is observed in cultured cells and in flies, and epistasis experiments show that the Mop protein functions upstream of the MyD88 adaptor and the Pelle kinase. Mop and Hrs, which are critical components of the ESCRT-0 endocytosis complex, colocalize with the Toll receptor in endosomes. We conclude that endocytosis is required for the activation of the Toll signaling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "During injury to the nervous system, innate immune cells mediate phagocytosis of debris, cytokine production, and axon regeneration. In the neuro-degenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), innate immune cells in the CNS are activated. However, the role of innate immunity in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) has not been well defined. In this study, we characterized robust activation of CD169/CD68/Iba1+ macrophages throughout the PNS in mutant SOD1(G93A) and SOD1(G37R) transgenic mouse models of ALS. Macrophage activation occurred pre-symptomatically, and expanded from focal arrays within nerve bundles to a tissue-wide distribution following symptom onset. We found a striking dichotomy for immune cells within the spinal cord and PNS. Flow cytometry and GFP bone marrow chimeras showed that spinal cord microglia were mainly tissue resident derived, dendritic-like cells, whereas in peripheral nerves, the majority of activated macrophages infiltrated from the circulation. Humoral antibodies and complement localized to PNS tissue in tandem with macrophage recruitment, and deficiency in complement C4 led to decreased macrophage activation. Therefore, cross-talk between nervous and immune systems occurs throughout the PNS during ALS disease progression. These data reveal a progressive innate and humoral immune response in peripheral nerves that is separate and distinct from spinal cord immune activation in ALS transgenic mice.",

        "Abstract": "The transcription factor NFATp integrates multiple signal transduction pathways through coordinate binding with basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins and other transcription factors. The NFATp monomer, even in the absence of its activation domains, recruits bZIP proteins to canonical NFAT-bZIP composite DNA elements. By contrast, the NFATp dimer and its bZIP partner bind noncooperatively to the NFAT-bZIP element of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene promoter. This observation raises the possibility that the function of the activation domains of NFATp is dimer-specific. Here, we determine the consensus DNA binding site of the NFATp dimer, describe monomer- and dimer-specific NFATp-DNA contact patterns, and demonstrate that NFATp dimerization and dimer-specific activation subdomains are required for transcriptional activation from the TNF NFAT-bZIP element. We also show that these NFATp subdomains interact with the coactivator CBP (CREB-binding protein), which is required for NFATp-dependent TNF gene transcription. Thus, the context-specific function of the activation domains of NFAT can be potentiated by DNA-directed dimerization.",

Some miRNAs are expressed in a cell- or tissue-specific manner and may contribute to the establishment and/or maintenance of cellular identity. Recent studies indicate that tissue-specific miRNAs may function at multiple hierarchical levels of gene regulatory networks, from targeting hundreds of effector genes incompatible with the differentiated state to controlling the levels of global regulators of transcription and alternative pre-mRNA splicing. This multilevel regulation may allow individual miRNAs to profoundly affect the gene expression program of differentiated cells.",

        "Abstract": "Both microRNAs and alternative pre-mRNA splicing have been implicated in the development of the nervous system (NS), but functional interactions between these two pathways are poorly understood. We demonstrate that the neuron-specific microRNA miR-124 directly targets PTBP1 (PTB/hnRNP I) mRNA, which encodes a global repressor of alternative pre-mRNA splicing in nonneuronal cells. Among the targets of PTBP1 is a critical cassette exon in the pre-mRNA of PTBP2 (nPTB/brPTB/PTBLP), an NS-enriched PTBP1 homolog. When this exon is skipped, PTBP2 mRNA is subject to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). During neuronal differentiation, miR-124 reduces PTBP1 levels, leading to the accumulation of correctly spliced PTBP2 mRNA and a dramatic increase in PTBP2 protein. These events culminate in the transition from non-NS to NS-specific alternative splicing patterns. We also present evidence that miR-124 plays a key role in the differentiation of progenitor cells to mature neurons. Thus, miR-124 promotes NS development, at least in part by regulating an intricate network of NS-specific alternative splicing.",

These factors bind cooperatively to the IFN-beta enhancer and recruit coactivators and chromatin-remodeling proteins to the IFN-beta promoter. We describe here a crystal structure of the DNA-binding domains of IRF-3, IRF-7, and NFkappaB, bound to one half of the enhancer, and use a previously described structure of the remaining half to assemble a complete picture of enhanceosome architecture in the vicinity of the DNA. Association of eight proteins with the enhancer creates a continuous surface for recognizing a composite DNA-binding element. Paucity of local protein-protein contacts suggests that cooperative occupancy of the enhancer comes from both binding-induced changes in DNA conformation and interactions with additional components such as CBP. Contacts with virtually every nucleotide pair account for the evolutionary invariance of the enhancer sequence.",

IRF-3 is activated through phosphorylation by the kinases IKK epsilon and/or TBK1. Phosphorylation results in IRF-3 dimerization and removal of an autoinhibitory structure to allow interaction with the coactivators CBP/p300. The precise role of the different phosphorylation sites has remained controversial. Using purified proteins we show that TBK1 can directly phosphorylate full-length IRF-3 in vitro. Phosphorylation at residues in site 2 (Ser(396)-Ser(405)) alleviates autoinhibition to allow interaction with CBP (CREB-binding protein) and facilitates phosphorylation at site 1 (Ser(385) or Ser(386)). Phosphorylation at site 1 is, in turn, required for IRF-3 dimerization. The data support a two-step phosphorylation model for IRF-3 activation mediated by TBK1.",

        "Abstract": "Here we report an in vitro model system for studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from mice carrying normal or mutant transgenic alleles of the human SOD1 gene were used to generate motor neurons by in vitro differentiation. These motor neurons could be maintained in long-term coculture either with additional cells that arose during differentiation or with primary glial cells. Motor neurons carrying either the nonpathological human SOD1 transgene or the mutant SOD1(G93A) allele showed neurodegenerative properties when cocultured with SOD1(G93A) glial cells. Thus, our studies demonstrate that glial cells carrying a human SOD1(G93A) mutation have a direct, non-cell autonomous effect on motor neuron survival. More generally, our results show that ESC-based models of disease provide a powerful tool for studying the mechanisms of neural degeneration. These phenotypes displayed in culture could provide cell-based assays for the identification of new ALS drugs.",

We report that, although mice lacking IKKepsilon produce normal amounts of IFNbeta, they are hypersusceptible to viral infection because of a defect in the IFN signaling pathway. Specifically, a subset of type I IFN-stimulated genes are not activated in the absence of IKKepsilon because the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 complex (ISGF3) does not bind to promoter elements of the affected genes. We demonstrate that IKKepsilon is activated by IFNbeta and that IKKepsilon directly phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), a component of ISGF3. We conclude that IKKepsilon plays a critical role in the IFN-inducible antiviral transcriptional response.",

        "Title": "Identification of long-range regulatory elements in the protocadherin-alpha gene cluster.",
        "Abstract": "The clustered protocadherins (Pcdh) are encoded by three closely linked gene clusters (Pcdh-alpha, -beta, and -gamma) that span nearly 1 million base pairs of DNA. The Pcdh-alpha gene cluster encodes a family of 14 distinct cadherin-like cell surface proteins that are expressed in neurons and are present at synaptic junctions. Individual Pcdh-alpha mRNAs are assembled from one of 14 \"variable\" (V) exons and three \"constant\" exons in a process that involves both differential promoter activation and alternative pre-mRNA splicing. In individual neurons, only one (and rarely two) of the Pcdh alpha1-12 promoters is independently and randomly activated on each chromosome. Thus, in most cells, this unusual form of monoallelic expression leads to the expression of two different Pcdh-alpha 1-12 V exons, one from each chromosome. The two remaining V exons in the cluster (Pcdh-alphaC1 and alphaC2) are expressed biallelically in every neuron. The mechanisms that underlie promoter choice and monoallelic expression in the Pcdh-alpha gene cluster are not understood. Here we report the identification of two long-range cis-regulatory elements in the Pcdh-alpha gene cluster, HS5-1 and HS7. We show that HS5-1 is required for maximal levels of expression from the Pcdh alpha1-12 and alphaC1 promoters, but not the Pcdh-alphaC2 promoter. The nearly cluster-wide requirement of the HS5-1 element is consistent with the possibility that the monoallelic expression of Pcdh-alpha V exons is a consequence of competition between individual V exon promoters for the two regulatory elements.",

        "Abstract": "Here, we develop computational methods to assess and consolidate large, diverse protein interaction data sets, with the objective of identifying proteins involved in the coupling of multicomponent complexes within the yeast gene expression pathway. From among approximately 43 000 total interactions and 2100 proteins, our methods identify known structural complexes, such as the spliceosome and SAGA, and functional modules, such as the DEAD-box helicases, within the interaction network of proteins involved in gene expression. Our process identifies and ranks instances of three distinct, biologically motivated motifs, or patterns of coupling among distinct machineries involved in different subprocesses of gene expression. Our results confirm known coupling among transcription, RNA processing, and export, and predict further coupling with translation and nonsense-mediated decay. We systematically corroborate our analysis with two independent, comprehensive experimental data sets. The methods presented here may be generalized to other biological processes and organisms to generate principled, systems-level network models that provide experimentally testable hypotheses for coupling among biological machines.",

        "Abstract": "Infection of Drosophila by Gram-negative bacteria triggers a signal transduction pathway (the IMD pathway) culminating in the expression of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides. A key component in this pathway is a Drosophila IkappaB kinase (DmIKK) complex, which stimulates the cleavage and activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor Relish. Activation of the DmIKK complex requires the MAP3K dTAK1, but the mechanism of dTAK1 activation is not understood. In human cells, the activation of TAK1 and IKK requires the human ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc13 and UEV1a. Here we demonstrate that the Drosophila homologs of Ubc13 and UEV1a are similarly required for the activation of dTAK1 and the DmIKK complex. Surprisingly, we find that the Drosophila caspase DREDD and its partner dFADD are required for the activation of DmIKK and JNK, in addition to their role in Relish cleavage. These studies reveal an evolutionarily conserved role of ubiquitination in IKK activation, and provide new insights into the hierarchy of signaling components in the Drosophila antibacterial immunity pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Premessenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing can occur within an individual pre-mRNA (cis-splicing) or between separate pre-mRNAs (trans-splicing). Although a number of examples of mammalian trans-splicing have been reported, the molecular mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of Sp1 pre-mRNA trans-splicing with human cells expressing modified Sp1 transgenes. We find that the presence of a long intron or the insertion of an RNA polymerase II pause site within an intron promotes trans-splicing. We also add examples of naturally occurring trans-splicing. We propose that Sp1 trans-splicing, and other examples of mammalian trans-splicing, are a consequence of low-frequency disruption of the normal mechanisms that couple transcription and splicing.",

        "Abstract": "The 5' and 3' splice sites within an intron can, in principle, be joined to those within any other intron during pre-mRNA splicing. However, exons are joined in a strict 5' to 3' linear order in constitutively spliced pre-mRNAs. Thus, specific mechanisms must exist to prevent the random joining of exons. Here we report that insertion of exon sequences into an intron can inhibit splicing to the downstream 3' splice site and that this inhibition is independent of intron size. The exon sequences required for splicing inhibition were found to be exonic enhancer elements, and their inhibitory activity requires the binding of serine/arginine-rich splicing factors. We conclude that exonic enhancers can act as barriers to prevent exon skipping and thereby may play a key role in ensuring the correct 5' to 3' linear order of exons in spliced mRNA.",

These factors cooperatively bind a composite DNA site and activate expression of the IFN-beta gene. The 3.0 A crystal structure of the DNA-binding domains of ATF-2/c-Jun and two IRF-3 molecules in a complex with 31 base pairs (bp) of the PRDIV-PRDIII region of the IFN-beta enhancer shows that association of the four proteins with DNA creates a continuous surface for the recognition of 24 bp. The structure, together with in vitro binding studies and protein mutagenesis, shows that protein-protein interactions are not critical for cooperative binding. Instead, cooperativity arises mainly through nucleotide sequence-dependent structural changes in the DNA that allow formation of complementary DNA conformations. Because the binding sites overlap on the enhancer, the unit of recognition is the entire nucleotide sequence, not the individual subsites.",

        "Title": "IFN-regulatory factor 3-dependent gene expression is defective in Tbk1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts.",
        "Abstract": "Virus infection, double-stranded RNA, and lipopolysaccharide each induce the expression of genes encoding IFN-alpha and -beta and chemokines, such as RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and IP-10 (IFN-gamma inducible protein 10). This induction requires the coordinate activation of several transcription factors, including IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). The signaling pathways leading to IRF3 activation are triggered by the binding of pathogen-specific products to Toll-like receptors and culminate in the phosphorylation of specific serine residues in the C terminus of IRF3. Recent studies of human cell lines in culture have implicated two noncanonical IkappaB kinase (IKK)-related kinases, IKK-epsilon and Traf family member-associated NF-kappaB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), in the phosphorylation of IRF3. Here, we show that purified recombinant IKK-epsilon and TBK1 directly phosphorylate the critical serine residues in IRF3. We have also examined the expression of IRF3-dependent genes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Tbk1(-/-) mice, and we show that TBK1 is required for the activation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 in these cells. Moreover, Tbk1(-/-) MEFs show marked defects in IFN-alpha and -beta, IP-10, and RANTES gene expression after infection with either Sendai or Newcastle disease viruses or after engagement of the Toll-like receptors 3 and 4 by double-stranded RNA and lipopolysaccharide, respectively. Finally, TRIF (TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing IFN-beta), fails to activate IRF3-dependent genes in Tbk1(-/-) MEFs. We conclude that TBK1 is essential for IRF3-dependent antiviral gene expression.",

        "Abstract": "Stimulation of the Drosophila immune response activates NF-kappaB and JNK signaling pathways. For example, infection by Gram-negative bacteria induces the Imd signaling pathway, leading to the activation of the NF-kappaB-like transcription factor Relish and the expression of a battery of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides. Bacterial infection also activates the JNK pathway, but the role of this pathway in the immune response has not yet been established. Genetic experiments suggest that the Drosophila homolog of the mammalian MAPK kinase kinase, TAK1 (transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1), activates both the JNK and NF-kappaB pathways following immune stimulation. In this report, we demonstrate that Drosophila TAK1 functions as both the Drosophila IkappaB kinase-activating kinase and the JNK kinase-activating kinase. However, we found that JNK signaling is not required for antimicrobial peptide gene expression but is required for the activation of other immune inducible genes, including Punch, sulfated, and malvolio. Thus, JNK signaling appears to play an important role in the cellular immune response and the stress response.",

Unlike other NF-kappaB proteins, Relish is activated by endoproteolytic cleavage to generate a DNA-binding Rel homology domain and a stable IkappaB-like fragment. This signal-induced endoproteolysis requires the activity of several gene products, including the IkappaB kinase complex and the caspase Dredd. Here we used mutational analysis and protein microsequencing to demonstrate that a caspase target site, located in the linker region between the Rel and the IkappaB-like domain, is the site of signal-dependent cleavage. We also show physical interaction between Relish and Dredd, suggesting that Dredd indeed is the Relish endoprotease. In addition to the caspase target site, the C-terminal 107 aa of Relish are required for endoproteolysis and signal-dependent phosphorylation by the Drosophila IkappaB kinase beta. Finally, an N-terminal serine-rich region in Relish and the PEST domain were found to negatively regulate Relish activation.",

        "Abstract": "The transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-kappaB are required for the expression of many genes involved in the innate immune response. Viral infection, or the binding of double-stranded RNA to Toll-like receptor 3, results in the coordinate activation of IRF3 and NF-kappaB. Activation of IRF3 requires signal-dependent phosphorylation, but little is known about the signaling pathway or kinases involved. Here we report that the noncanonical IkappaB kinase homologs, IkappaB kinase-epsilon (IKKepsilon) and TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1), which were previously implicated in NF-kappaB activation, are also essential components of the IRF3 signaling pathway. Thus, IKKepsilon and TBK1 have a pivotal role in coordinating the activation of IRF3 and NF-kappaB in the innate immune response.",

        "Abstract": "A family of mammalian protocadherin (Pcdh) proteins is encoded by three closely linked gene clusters (alpha, beta, and gamma). Multiple alpha and gamma Pcdh mRNAs are expressed in distinct patterns in the nervous system and are generated by alternative pre-mRNA splicing between different \"variable\" exons and three \"constant\" exons within each cluster. We show that each Pcdh variable exon is preceded by a promoter and that promoter choice determines which variable exon is included in a Pcdh mRNA. In addition, we provide evidence that alternative splicing of variable exons within a gene cluster occurs via a cis-splicing mechanism. However, virtually every variable exon can engage in trans-splicing with constant exons from another cluster, albeit at a far lower level.",

        "Abstract": "The protein coding sequences of most eukaryotic messenger RNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) are interrupted by non-coding sequences called introns. Pre-mRNA splicing is the process by which introns are removed and the protein coding elements assembled into mature mRNAs. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing selectively joins different protein coding elements to form mRNAs that encode proteins with distinct functions, and is therefore an important source of protein diversity. The elaboration of this mechanism may have had a significant role in the expansion of metazoan proteomes during evolution.",

        "Abstract": "Gene expression in eukaryotes requires several multi-component cellular machines. Each machine carries out a separate step in the gene expression pathway, which includes transcription, several pre-messenger RNA processing steps and the export of mature mRNA to the cytoplasm. Recent studies lead to the view that, in contrast to a simple linear assembly line, a complex and extensively coupled network has evolved to coordinate the activities of the gene expression machines. The extensive coupling is consistent with a model in which the machines are tethered to each other to form 'gene expression factories' that maximize the efficiency and specificity of each step in gene expression.",
