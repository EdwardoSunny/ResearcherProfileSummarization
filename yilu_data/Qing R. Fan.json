        "Abstract": "Human calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that maintains extracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis through the regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion. It functions as a disulfide-tethered homodimer composed of three main domains, the Venus Flytrap module, cysteine-rich domain, and seven-helix transmembrane region. Here, we present the crystal structures of the entire extracellular domain of CaSR in the resting and active conformations. We provide direct evidence that L-amino acids are agonists of the receptor. In the active structure, L-Trp occupies the orthosteric agonist-binding site at the interdomain cleft and is primarily responsible for inducing extracellular domain closure to initiate receptor activation. Our structures reveal multiple binding sites for Ca(2+) and PO4(3-) ions. Both ions are crucial for structural integrity of the receptor. While Ca(2+) ions stabilize the active state, PO4(3-) ions reinforce the inactive conformation. The activation mechanism of CaSR involves the formation of a novel dimer interface between subunits.",

        "Abstract": "Access to experimental X-ray diffraction image data is fundamental for validation and reproduction of macromolecular models and indispensable for development of structural biology processing methods. Here, we established a diffraction data publication and dissemination system, Structural Biology Data Grid (SBDG; data.sbgrid.org), to preserve primary experimental data sets that support scientific publications. Data sets are accessible to researchers through a community driven data grid, which facilitates global data access. Our analysis of a pilot collection of crystallographic data sets demonstrates that the information archived by SBDG is sufficient to reprocess data to statistics that meet or exceed the quality of the original published structures. SBDG has extended its services to the entire community and is used to develop support for other types of biomedical data sets. It is anticipated that access to the experimental data sets will enhance the paradigm shift in the community towards a much more dynamic body of continuously improving data analysis.",

        "Title": "Heterodimeric coiled-coil interactions of human GABAB receptor.",
        "Abstract": "Metabotropic GABAB receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates inhibitory neurotransmission in the CNS. It functions as an obligatory heterodimer of GABAB receptor 1 (GBR1) and GABAB receptor 2 (GBR2) subunits. The association between GBR1 and GBR2 masks an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal in the cytoplasmic region of GBR1 and facilitates cell surface expression of both subunits. Here, we present, to our knowledge, the first crystal structure of an intracellular coiled-coil heterodimer of human GABAB receptor. We found that polar interactions buried within the hydrophobic core determine the specificity of heterodimer pairing. Disruption of the hydrophobic coiled-coil interface with single mutations in either subunit impairs surface expression of GBR1, confirming that the coiled-coil interaction is required to inactivate the adjacent ER retention signal of GBR1. The coiled-coil assembly buries an internalization motif of GBR1 at the heterodimer interface. The ER retention signal of GBR1 is not part of the core coiled-coil structure, suggesting that it is sterically shielded by GBR2 upon heterodimer formation.",

        "Abstract": "Human GABA(B) (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid class B) receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor central to inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. It functions as an obligatory heterodimer of the subunits GBR1 and GBR2. Here we present the crystal structures of a heterodimeric complex between the extracellular domains of GBR1 and GBR2 in the apo, agonist-bound and antagonist-bound forms. The apo and antagonist-bound structures represent the resting state of the receptor; the agonist-bound complex corresponds to the active state. Both subunits adopt an open conformation at rest, and only GBR1 closes on agonist-induced receptor activation. The agonists and antagonists are anchored in the interdomain crevice of GBR1 by an overlapping set of residues. An antagonist confines GBR1 to the open conformation of the inactive state, whereas an agonist induces its domain closure for activation. Our data reveal a unique activation mechanism for GABA(B) receptor that involves the formation of a novel heterodimer interface between subunits.",

        "Abstract": "Inhibitory neurotransmission is mediated primarily by GABA. The metabotropic GABA(B) receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor central to mammalian brain function. Malfunction of GABA(B) receptor has been implicated in several neurological disorders. GABA(B) receptor functions as a heterodimeric assembly of GBR1 and GBR2 subunits, where GBR1 is responsible for ligand-binding and GBR2 is responsible for G protein coupling. Here we demonstrate that the GBR2 ectodomain directly interacts with the GBR1 ectodomain to increase agonist affinity by selectively stabilizing the agonist-bound conformation of GBR1. We present the crystal structure of the GBR2 ectodomain, which reveals a polar heterodimeric interface. We also identify specific heterodimer contacts from both subunits, and GBR1 residues involved in ligand recognition. Lastly, our structural and functional data indicate that the GBR2 ectodomain adopts a constitutively open conformation, suggesting a structural asymmetry in the active state of GABA(B) receptor that is unique to the GABAergic system.",

        "Abstract": "Proteins with leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) specialize in mediating protein-protein interactions. The hormone binding portion of the receptor for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is an LRR protein by sequence, and the crystal structure of this domain from human FSH receptor in a complex with FSH shows that it does indeed have an LRR structure. It differs from other LRR domains, however, in being an all-beta protein composed of highly irregular repeats and having only slight overall curvature. Despite these distinctions and a superficial resemblance to beta-helical proteins, the binding domain of FSH receptor clearly is an LRR protein. The structure does consist of two parts with distinctively different curvatures. Comparison with the structures of other LRR-containing proteins shows a correlation between curvature and main-chain hydrogen bonding pattern of the parallel beta-sheet. The hormone-binding site is located at the concave surface of the receptor structure, a feature common to proteins with LRR motifs. Analysis of the ligand-binding site of LRR-containing proteins reveals that they generally utilize extensive interface area and a large number of charged residues to facilitate high-affinity protein-protein interactions.",

FSH signals through a G-protein coupled receptor (FSHR) on the target cell surface. We describe here the strategy to produce a soluble FSH-FSHR complex that involves the co-secretion of a truncated FSHR ectodomain (FSHR(HB)) and a covalently linked FSHalphabeta heterodimer from baculovirus-infected insect cells. FSH binds to FSHR(HB) with a high affinity comparable to that for the full-length receptor. The crystal structure of the FSH-FSHR(HB) complex provides explanations for the high affinity and specificity of FSH interaction with FSHR, and it shows an unexpected dimerization of these complexes. Here we also compare the crystal structure with theoretical models of the FSH-FSHR-binding mode. We conclude that the FSH-FSHR(HB) structure gives an authentic representation of FSH binding to intact FSHR.",

It acts through a G-protein-coupled receptor on the surface of target cells to stimulate testicular and ovarian functions. We present here the 2.9-A-resolution structure of a partially deglycosylated complex of human FSH bound to the extracellular hormone-binding domain of its receptor (FSHR(HB)). The hormone is bound in a hand-clasp fashion to an elongated, curved receptor. The buried interface of the complex is large (2,600 A2) and has a high charge density. Our analysis suggests that all glycoprotein hormones bind to their receptors in this mode and that binding specificity is mediated by key interaction sites involving both the common alpha- and hormone-specific beta-subunits. On binding, FSH undergoes a concerted conformational change that affects protruding loops implicated in receptor activation. The FSH-FSHR(HB) complexes form dimers in the crystal and at high concentrations in solution. Such dimers may participate in transmembrane signal transduction.",
