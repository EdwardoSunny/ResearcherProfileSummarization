        "Abstract": "Despite decades of international entreaties for improvement, education about and provision of healthcare for people with disabilities remains harmfully inferior to that of the non-disabled population. Many obstacles confound efforts to ameliorate this inequity, perhaps the most pernicious of which is negative bias on the part of providers. Narrative medicine offers a means to address healthcare attitudes towards people with disabilities, in particular negative attitudes based on 'ableism'. Through absorbing, writing, and sharing of diverse perspectives, narrative medicine kindles imagination and empathy, promoting self-reflection. This approach enriches the students' capacity to absorb what their patients are trying to say, and to appreciate, respect, and hopefully meet the healthcare needs of people with disability. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Narrative medicine is a pedagogical tool to help providers listen and reflect on patients with disabilities.",

This interdisciplinary engagement between philosophers and Covid medical professionals reports the challenges as well as the discrepancies between ethical guidelines and reality. This collection of presentations identifies four key ethical dilemmas regarding responsibility, fairness, dignity and honouring death. In looking into accountability and consistency in medical humanities, it examines whether the contextuality of coronavirus across countries and cultures affected the ethical decision-making processes. This work aims to provide a seminal resource for the development of a high-quality roadmap in medical ethics for future health crises.",

        "Abstract": "Interprofessional education (IPE) is a\u00a0critical component of medical education and is affected by the characteristics of the clinical teams in which students and residents train. However, clinical teams are often shaped by professional silos and hierarchies which may hinder interprofessional collaborative practice (IPCP). Narrative medicine, a\u00a0branch of health humanities that focuses on close reading, reflective writing, and sharing in groups, could be an innovative approach for improving IPE and IPCP. In this report, we describe the structure, feasibility, and a\u00a0process-oriented program evaluation of a\u00a0narrative medicine program implemented in interprofessional team meetings in three academic primary care clinics. Program evaluation revealed that a\u00a0year-long narrative medicine program with modest monthly exposure was feasible in academic clinical settings. Staff members expressed engagement and acceptability as well as support for ongoing implementation. Program success required administrative buy-in and sustainability may require staff training in narrative medicine.",

        "Abstract": "The day-to-day rigors of medical education often preclude learners from gaining a longitudinal perspective on who they are becoming. Furthermore, the current focus on competencies, coupled with concerning rates of trainee burnout and a decline in empathy, have fueled the search for pedagogic tools to foster students' reflective capacity. In response, many scholars have looked to the tradition of narrative medicine to foster \"reflective spaces\" wherein holistic professional identity construction can be supported. This article focuses on the rationale, content, and early analysis of the reflective space created by the narrative medicine-centered portfolio at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. In January 2015, the authors investigated learning outcomes derived from students' \"Signature Reflections,\" end-of-semester meta-reflections on their previous portfolio work. The authors analyzed the Signature Reflections of 97 (of 132) first-year medical students using a constant comparative process. This iterative approach allowed researchers to identify themes within students' writings and interpret the data. The authors identified two overarching interpretive themes-recognition and grappling-and six subthemes. Recognition included comments about self-awareness and empathy. Grappling encompassed the subthemes of internal change, dichotomies, wonder and questioning, and anxiety. Based on the authors' analyses, the Signature Reflection seems to provide a structured framework that encourages students' reflective capacity and the construction of holistic professional identity. Other medical educators may adopt meta-reflection, within the reflective space of a writing portfolio, to encourage students' acquisition of a longitudinal perspective on who they are becoming and how they are constructing their professional identity.",

        "Abstract": "The author notes the impressive growth in medical humanities programs, scholarly journals, textbooks, and national and international conferences as well as the convening of two recent national forums or boards addressing the potential of the humanities and the arts to improve medical practice. She also notes that the field of medical humanities seems to have shifted from addressing topics on the margins of medical education to equipping students with the foundational skills required for effective doctoring. This Invited Commentary proposes a number of personal, relational, and interpretive consequences to rigorous training in the humanities or the arts that might lead to improvement in the skills of doctoring. Where else but in hospitals with very ill patients and very young doctors who care for them are such skills needed the most? The author suggests that to see the suffering might be what the humanities in medicine are for, and that those who become capable of seeing the suffering around them in medical practice both experience the cost of countenancing the full burden of illness and death and, simultaneously, comprehend with clarity the worth of this thing, this life.",

        "Title": "Close Reading and Creative Writing in Clinical Education: Teaching Attention, Representation, and Affiliation.",
        "Abstract": "Medical educators increasingly have embraced literary and narrative means of pedagogy, such as the use of learning portfolios, reading works of literature, reflective writing, and creative writing, to teach interpersonal and reflective aspects of medicine. Outcomes studies of such pedagogies support the hypotheses that narrative training can deepen the clinician's attention to a patient and can help to establish the clinician's affiliation with patients, colleagues, teachers, and the self. In this article, the authors propose that creative writing in particular is useful in the making of the physician. Of the conceptual frameworks that explain why narrative training is helpful for clinicians, the authors focus on aesthetic theories to articulate the mechanisms through which creative and reflective writing may have dividends in medical training. These theories propose that accurate perception requires representation and that representation requires reception, providing a rationale for teaching clinicians and trainees how to represent what they perceive in their clinical work and how to read one another's writings. The authors then describe the narrative pedagogy used at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. Because faculty must read what their students write, they receive robust training in close reading. From this training emerged the Reading Guide for Reflective Writing, which has been useful to clinicians as they develop their skills as close readers. This institution-wide effort to teach close reading and creative writing aims to equip students and faculty with the prerequisites to provide attentive, empathic clinical care.",

This response may in turn lead to further reflection, representation, and response in a circular pattern. A unique feature of this program is that it pays attention to the representation itself as the pivotal activity within reflective learning. Using the narrative methods that are the hallmark of this program, faculty writings were analyzed to characterize the essential benefits that derive from these practices.",

        "Abstract": "This commentary reflects on the first decade of the Teaching and Learning Moments (TLM) feature of Academic Medicine. The author places the feature within the context of a growing movement within health care to improve reflective practice through the practice of reflective writing and reading. As an example of the opportunity these reflective activities afford, the author depicts a seminar in which students and faculty from four health sciences schools learn together about culture, illness, and health care. The participants find that their own capacity to examine and write about aspects of their own lived experience contributes to their understanding of patients. The seminar has been a meaningful adventure for these students and clinicians, as the TLM feature has been for its authors and readers. Meeting on the grounds of stories of patients and of themselves, readers and writers demonstrate for themselves how their source of commitment to health is to be found very deep within the self. As a dividend, these moments of teaching and learning provide what is needed to become members of effective health care teams.",

        "Title": "At the membranes of care: stories in narrative medicine.",
        "Abstract": "Recognizing clinical medicine as a narrative undertaking fortified by learnable skills in understanding stories has helped doctors and teachers to face otherwise vexing problems in medical practice and education in the areas of professionalism, medical interviewing, reflective practice, patient-centered care, and self-awareness. The emerging practices of narrative medicine give clinicians fresh methods with which to make contact with patients and to come to understand their points of view. This essay provides a brief review of narrative theory regarding the structure of stories, suggesting that clinical texts contain and can reveal information in excess of their plots. Through close reading of the form and content of two clinical texts-an excerpt from a medical chart and a portion of an audiotaped interview with a medical student-and a reflection on a short section of a modernist novel, the author suggests ways to expand conventional medical routines of recognizing the meanings of patients' situations. The contributions of close reading and reflective writing to clinical practice may occur by increasing the capacities to perceive and then to represent the perceived, thereby making available to a writer that which otherwise might remain out of awareness. A clinical case is given to exemplify the consequences in practice of adopting the methods of narrative medicine. A metaphor of the activated cellular membrane is proposed as a figure for the effective clinician/patient contact.",

        "Abstract": "Reflective writing is being introduced in many medical schools in the United States and abroad for a variety of reasons and with a variety of goals in mind. As Wald and colleagues write, multiple methods, including the rubric introduced in their study, have been proposed for rating or grading this writing to quantify the gains obtained. The authors of this commentary detail the assumptions both about reflection and about writing implied in Wald and colleagues' work. They then describe a reciprocal model of writing as discovery, suggesting that the writing itself is what teaches the skills of reflection. Equipping medical students with a sense of story may well be the active ingredient in whatever gains are observed in teaching reflective writing.",

        "Abstract": "The inclusion of humanities in medical school curriculum has generated much pedagogic experimentation and assessment. Publications in medical journals in the past decade reflect the experience of teaching humanities in medical schools and the motives for which they are taught. As Ousager and Johannessen demonstrate elsewhere in this issue, short- and medium-range outcomes are available for examination, but the author of this commentary argues that the long view of change in clinical practice will not be available for another decade or more as the undergraduate student slowly becomes a full-fledged clinician. Rather than beg off the need to measure these teaching efforts, teachers in the humanities can embrace the demanding task of delineating how medicine changes when fortified by narrative competence and humanities-derived skills. To do so requires an examination of the institutional cultures in which patients and clinicians together try to address problems of the sick.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to test the feasibility and effectiveness of providing narrative training to a mixed group of doctors, nurses, social workers, and child life therapists on a pediatric oncology service for the purpose of promoting empathy, building teams, and preventing burnout. All staff members were invited to attend a weekly narrative training seminar for 6 weeks. During these seminars, participants wrote about their attachment to patients, their emotional responses to patients and families, and their attempts to imagine clinical situations from the perspectives of patients and family members; participants then read aloud their narratives to one another during a facilitated discussion. Baseline and post-intervention assessments used the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and the Stressor Scale for Pediatric Oncology Nurses (SSPON), and a focus group was convened to assess qualitative outcomes at the study's conclusion. Nineteen staff members who consented and participated in the training completed all baseline and postintervention measures.THE IRI subset of Perspective Taking improved at a statistically significant level (P = 0.029), and the Empathic Concern subset trended toward significant improvement (P= 0.056). Reported stress levels on the SSPON increased at varying rates over the course of the study. Focus group reports indicated that teamwork and resilience improved in the 6 weeks of the seminar. A narrative training approach aimed at an inter-disciplinary group of healthcare professionals has promise as a means to address some of the most difficult aspects of pediatric oncology care facing clinicians.",

        "Title": "Personal illness narratives: using reflective writing to teach empathy.",
        "Abstract": "Reflective writing is one established method for teaching medical students empathetic interactions with patients. Most such exercises rely on students' reflecting upon clinical experiences. To effectively elicit, interpret, and translate the patient's story, however, a reflective practitioner must also be self-aware, personally and professionally. Race, gender, and other embodied sources of identity of practitioners and patients have been shown to influence the nature of clinical communication. Yet, although medical practice is dedicated to examining, diagnosing, and treating bodies, the relationship of physicians to their own physicality is vexed. Medical training creates a dichotomy whereby patients are identified by their bodies while physicians' bodies are secondary to physicians' minds. As a result, little opportunity is afforded to physicians to deal with personal illness experiences, be they their own or those of loved ones. This article describes a reflective writing exercise conducted in a second-year medical student humanities seminar. The \"personal illness narrative\" exercise created a medium for students to elicit, interpret, and translate their personal illness experiences while witnessing their colleagues' stories. Qualitative analysis of students' evaluation comments indicated that the exercise, although emotionally challenging, was well received and highly recommended for other students and residents. The reflective writing exercise may be incorporated into medical curricula aimed at increasing trainees' empathy. Affording students and residents an opportunity to describe and share their illness experiences may counteract the traditional distancing of physicians' minds from their bodies and lead to more empathic and self-aware practice.",
