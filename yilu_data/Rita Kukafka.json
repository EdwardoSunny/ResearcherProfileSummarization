        "Abstract": "Orthodox Jewish women face unique social, cultural, and religious factors that may influence uptake of BRCA1/2 genetic testing. We examined the impact of a web-based decision aid (DA) on BRCA1/2 genetic testing intention/completion among Orthodox Jewish women. We conducted a single-arm pilot study among 50 Orthodox Jewish women who were given access to a web-based DA entitled RealRisks and administered serial surveys at baseline and 1 and 6 months after exposure to the DA. Descriptive statistics were conducted for baseline characteristics and study measures. Comparisons were made to assess changes in study measures over time. Fifty Orthodox Jewish women enrolled in the study with a mean age of 43.9 years (standard deviation [SD] 14.6), 70% Modern Orthodox, 2% with personal history of breast cancer, and 68% and 16% with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, respectively. At baseline, 27 (54%) participants intended to complete genetic testing. Forty-three participants (86%) completed RealRisks and the 1-month survey and 38 (76%) completed the 6-month survey. There was a significant improvement in BRCA1/2 genetic testing knowledge and decrease in decisional conflict after exposure to the DA. At 1 month, only 20 (46.5%) completed or intended to complete genetic testing (p\u2009=\u20090.473 compared to baseline). While the DA improved genetic testing knowledge and reduced decisional conflict, genetic testing intention/completion did not increase over time. Future interventions should directly address barriers to BRCA1/2 genetic testing uptake and include input from leaders in the Orthodox Jewish community.",

        "Abstract": "Research on polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for common, genetically complex chronic diseases aims to improve health-related predictions, tailor risk-reducing interventions, and improve health outcomes. Yet, the study and use of PRSs in clinical settings raise equity, clinical, and regulatory challenges that can be greater for individuals from historically marginalized racial, ethnic, and other minoritized communities. As part of the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics IV Network, we conducted online focus groups with patients/community members, clinicians, and members of institutional review boards to explore their views on key issues, including PRS research, return of PRS results, clinical translation, and barriers and facilitators to health behavioral changes in response to PRS results. Across stakeholder groups, our findings indicate support for PRS development and a strong interest in having PRS results returned to research participants. However, we also found multi-level barriers and significant differences in stakeholders' views about what is needed and possible for successful implementation. These include researcher-participant interaction formats, health and genomic literacy, and a range of structural barriers, such as financial instability, insurance coverage, and the absence of health-supporting infrastructure and affordable healthy food options in poorer neighborhoods. Our findings highlight the need to revisit and implement measures in PRS studies (e.g., incentives and resources for follow-up care), as well as system-level policies to promote equity in genomic research and health outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Breast cancer chemoprevention with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) or aromatase inhibitors (AI) remains underutilized among high-risk women. A potential barrier to chemoprevention is competing comorbidities such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), due to concern for additional medication side effects. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among women with atypical hyperplasia (AH) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), an important target population for chemoprevention. We compared risks for breast cancer and ASCVD, as well as use of SERMs/AIs versus statins among high-risk women (defined as a 5-year invasive breast cancer risk \u22651.67% and 10-year ASCVD risk \u22657.5%, respectively). We used clinical data extracted from the electronic health record to calculate breast cancer risk according to the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium model and ASCVD risk according to the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association risk calculator. Among 298 evaluable women, mean age was 58.2 years (SD, 8.34), with 33% non-Hispanic White, 41% Hispanic, 9% non-Hispanic Black, 6% Asian, and 11% other/unknown race/ethnicity. About 98% of women met high-risk criteria for breast cancer, whereas 30% were high-risk for ASCVD. Mean 10-year risk of breast cancer was higher than mean 10-year risk of ASCVD (9.14% vs. 6.69%; P < 0.001). Among women who met high-risk criteria for both diseases, use of statins was higher compared with SERMs/AIs (58% vs. 21%; P < 0.001). Among women with AH or LCIS, statin use was higher compared with breast cancer chemoprevention among eligible women, despite having a higher mean risk of breast cancer than ASCVD.",

        "Abstract": "A cross-sectional survey was conducted among high-risk, racially/ethnically diverse adults at the point in time when New York City (NYC) became the COVID-19 pandemic's global epicenter. The study objective was to assess the threat and coping appraisals (cognitive factors known to correspond with people's willingness to adopt behaviorally focused interventions) and levels of distress, anxiety, and intolerance for uncertainty (emotional factors). Survey respondents were recruited in April 2020 using an online survey with unpaid recruitment on the GetHealthyHeights.org community-oriented website. We also recruited participants that engaged in previous research studies to gain survey responses from community members at higher risk for COVID-19 complications due to comorbidities compared to the general population. Analysis was performed to test for differences in survey responses by comorbidities, age, race, ethnicity, and employment status. Results show that the devastating effects of the pandemic appear to have uniquely impacted minority respondents, who reported significantly higher levels of anxiety and were significantly more likely to report having little control over whether they will get COVID-19 compared with White/non-Hispanic respondents. Minority respondents also had significantly higher mean scores on the behaviorally focused dimension of the intolerance of uncertainty (IU) scale, which measures avoidance and paralysis in the face of uncertainty. In multivariate analysis, IU predicted anxiety levels, and this association was not mediated by cognitive factors (threat and coping appraisals). By conducting this survey early in the pandemic, our study uniquely evaluated cognitive and emotional factors among a racially/ethnically diverse group of NYC residents during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest the need to acknowledge the disparities that appear to exist in pandemic response and for culturally tailored messaging and interventions. Few studies have reported differences by race and ethnicity during pandemic exposure. Therefore, further research on factors that may influence pandemic response among minority populations is needed.",

        "Abstract": "Dense breast notification (DBN) legislation aims to increase a woman's awareness of her personal breast density and the implications of having dense breasts for breast cancer detection and risk. This information may adversely affect women's breast cancer worry, perceptions of risk, and uncertainty about screening, which may persist over time or vary by sociodemographic factors. We examined short- and long-term psychological responses to DBN and awareness of breast density (BD).",

        "Abstract": "Significant underutilization of breast cancer chemoprevention remains, despite guidelines stating that physicians should recommend chemoprevention with antiestrogen therapy to high-risk women. We randomized women, ages 35 to 75 years, who met high-risk criteria for breast cancer, without a personal history of breast cancer or prior chemoprevention use, to standard educational materials alone or combined with a web-based decision aid. All healthcare providers, including primary care providers and breast specialists, were given access to a web-based decision support tool. The primary endpoint was chemoprevention uptake at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included decision antecedents (perceived breast cancer risk/worry, chemoprevention knowledge, self-efficacy) and decision quality (decision conflict, chemoprevention informed choice) based upon patient surveys administered at baseline, 1 and 6 months after randomization. Among 282 evaluable high-risk women enrolled from November 2016 to March 2020, mean age was 57 years (SD, 9.9) and mean 5-year invasive breast cancer risk was 2.98% (SD, 1.42). There was no significant difference in chemoprevention uptake at 6 months between the intervention and control groups (2.1% vs. 3.5%). Comparing the intervention and control arms at 1 month, there were significant differences among high-risk women in accurate breast cancer risk perceptions (56% vs. 39%, P = 0.017), adequate chemoprevention knowledge (49% vs. 27%, P < 0.001), mean decision conflict (34.0 vs. 47.0, P < 0.001), and informed choice (41% vs. 23%, P = 0.003). These differences were no longer significant at 6 months. Although our decision support tools did not result in a significant increase in chemoprevention uptake, we did observe improvements in decision antecedents and decision quality measures.",

        "Abstract": "We evaluated strategies to identify and recruit a racially/ethnically diverse cohort of women at high-risk for breast cancer to a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We enrolled 300 high-risk women and 50 healthcare providers to a RCT of standard educational materials alone or in combination with web-based decision support tools. We implemented five strategies to identify high-risk women: (i) recruitment among patients previously enrolled in a study evaluating breast cancer risk; (ii) automated breast cancer risk calculation using information extracted from the electronic health record (EHR); (iii) identification of women with atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10 diagnostic codes; (iv) clinical encounters with enrolled healthcare providers; (v) recruitment flyers/online resources. Breast cancer risk was calculated using either the Gail or Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) models. We identified 6,229 high-risk women and contacted 3,459 (56%), of whom 17.2% were identified from prior study cohort, 37.5% through EHR risk information, 14.8% with atypical hyperplasia/LCIS, 29.0% by clinical encounters, and 1.5% through recruitment flyers. Women from the different recruitment sources varied by age and 5-year invasive breast cancer risk. Of 300 enrolled high-risk women, 44.7% came from clinical encounters and 27.3% from prior study cohort. Comparing enrolled with not-enrolled participants, there were significant differences in mean age (57.2 vs. 59.1 years), proportion of non-Whites (41.5% vs. 54.8%), and mean 5-year breast cancer risk (3.0% vs. 2.3%). We identified and successfully recruited diverse high-risk women from multiple sources. These strategies may be implemented in future breast cancer chemoprevention trials.",

A critical component of the survey was to assess how credible and trustworthy respondents found various information sources. To advertise and distribute the survey, we embedded an invitation to participate using a popup on the GetHealthyHeights.org website. GetHealthyHeights was designed using community-based participatory research for the medically-underserved, urban, and largely Latinx community of Washington Heights-Inwood, New York City. We received 321 responses from April through July 2020. Participant ages ranged from 25 to 87, and 25% were Latinx. Results showed that the choice of and trust in different COVID-19 information sources were observed to be significantly different across demographic variables, including gender, age, race, and chronic health conditions. In the domains of trust and information source credibility, designers should account for perspectives of diverse subgroups.",

However, limited time during clinical encounters is one barrier to routine breast cancer risk assessment. We evaluated if electronic health record (EHR) data downloaded using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is sufficient for breast cancer risk calculation in our decision support tools, RealRisks and BNAV. We accessed EHR data using FHIR for six patient advocates, and downloaded and parsed XML documents. We searched for relevant clinical variables, and evaluated if data was sufficient to calculate risk using validated models (Gail, Breast Cancer Screening Consortium [BCSC], BRCAPRO). While only one advocate had sufficient EHR data to calculate risk using the BCSC model only, we identified variables including age, race/ethnicity, mammographic density, and prior breast biopsy in most advocates. EHR data from FHIR could be incorporated into automated breast cancer risk calculation in clinical decision support tools.",

        "Abstract": "Genetic counseling is under-utilized in women who meet family history criteria for BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) testing, particularly among racial/ethnic minorities. We evaluated the uptake of BRCA1/2 genetic testing among women presenting for screening mammography in a predominantly Hispanic, low-income population of Washington Heights in New York City. We administered the Six-Point Scale (SPS) to women presenting for screening mammography at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York, NY. The SPS is a family history screener to determine eligibility for BRCA1/2 genetic testing based upon U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines that has been validated in low-income, multiethnic populations. Among women who underwent screening mammography at CUIMC between November 2014 and June 2016, 3,055 completed the SPS family history screener. Participants were predominantly Hispanic (76.7%), and 12% met family history criteria for BRCA1/2 testing, of whom <5% had previously undergone testing. In a multiethnic population, a significant proportion met family history criteria for BRCA1/2 testing, but uptake of genetic testing was low. Such underutilization of BRCA1/2 genetic testing among minorities further underscores the need to develop programs to engage high-risk women from underrepresented populations in genetic testing services.",

The six-point-scale (SPS) is a validated family history screener that is used to determine eligibility for BRCA genetic counseling. We automated the calculation of the SPS score using structured family history data along with free text from the electronic health record (EHR) to detect detailed family history information of breast cancer. We extracted data for all women aged 35 to 74 who had screening mammography at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) from January 2015 to May 2017 (N=37,596). After we calculated SPS scores using structured and free-text EHR data, we compared the results with SPS score calculated from a baseline survey conducted for a prospective study called Know Your Risks: Assessment at Screening (KYRAS). Among 1,202 patients with EHR structured family history data, we found 1.43% had an SPS score of 6 higher which meets criteria for genetic counseling referral, while 12.05% of the survey respondents had SPS score of 6 or higher. Results show there is a need for more efficient methods to identify patients eligible for genetic counseling through EHR analysis.",

        "Abstract": "The United States Preventive Services Taskforce recommends that primary care providers screen patients for an increased risk of carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and refer those who meet family history criteria to genetic counseling. Such screening requires detailed and accurate family history data, which often goes uncollected during a primary care visit due to time constraints, competing priorities, and lack of awareness on behalf of both patients and providers. In order to address these barriers and promote appropriate genetic counseling referral, we developed a user-centered framework that collects and communicates relevant data in order to prepare patients and their primary care providers for an informed discussion on genetic counseling referral.

For this reason, the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended that all women be screened in the primary care setting for a family history indicative of a mutation, and women with strong family histories of breast or ovarian cancer be referred to genetic counseling. However, few high-risk women are being routinely screened and fewer are referred to genetic counseling. To address this need we have developed two decision support tools that are integrated into clinical care.",

Addressing social determinants and population health requires mobilization of health-related resources in communities. We present a framework for evaluating the process and outcomes of a CEHI platform designed to improve connectivity among community health resources. The GetHealthyHeights.org CEHI platform was implemented in an urban low-income community. It was designed to facilitate connectivity among health-related community-based organizations (CBOs). To evaluate the process towards and the achievement of connectivity, a conceptual framework, methodology, and operational measures were defined. A system-level approach, such as social network analysis, is required to capture the community as one dynamic unit. The evaluation framework specifies network connectivity metrics based on a social network survey. A network survey of CBOs (n=35) at baseline demonstrates utility of social network data for characterizing connectivity among community resources. The evaluation framework models how informatics and community resources improve population health.",

        "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the United States, and current routine screening prevention methods are costly and expose patients to unnecessary risks of overtreatment. The utilization of a risk-based stratification model, genetic testing, and chemoprevention could decrease the incidence of invasive breast cancer but uptake has been low among high-risk women. The goal of this project was to implement a comprehensive informatics framework to promote breast cancer risk assessment and chemoprevention in the primary care setting that was informed by potential user feedback. The framework provides evidence-based decision support to both providers and patients. For providers we developed a novel breast cancer risk navigation (BNAV) tool which incorporates an evidence-based breast cancer risk model into the electronic health record. For patients a decision aid was designed that allows participants to experience risk through an activity and to address patient-related barriers to chemoprevention. We conducted usability testing to determine barriers and facilitators affecting the toolbox use by providers. A total of seven subjects were recruited and completed the usability testing. Using think-aloud protocols, semi-structured interviews, and subject recordings, we identified recurring themes related to the usability of BNAV. Themes specifically aligned with the content, ease of use, and navigation of the application. This feedback was used to make interface changes to the application that more appropriately tailored BNAV to engage the target population of primary care providers and thus more effectively optimizing shared decision-making associated with breast cancer risk assessment and prevention in clinical practice. A comprehensive informatics framework to increase breast cancer risk assessment and chemoprevention in the primary care setting has been successfully introduced to address this challenge. Given the proven efficacy of breast cancer chemoprevention in high-risk populations, higher uptake may significantly reduce the public health burden of this disease.",

        "Abstract": "Chemoprevention with antiestrogens could decrease the incidence of invasive breast cancer but uptake has been low among high-risk women in the United States. We have designed a web-based patient-facing decision aid, called RealRisks, to inform high-risk women about the risks and benefits of chemoprevention and facilitate shared decision-making with their primary care provider. We conducted two rounds of usability testing to determine how subjects engaged with and understood the information in RealRisks. A total of 7 English-speaking and 4 Spanish-speaking subjects completed testing. Using surveys, think-aloud protocols, and subject recordings, we identified several themes relating to the usability of RealRisks, specifically in the content, ease of use, and navigability of the application. By conducting studies in two languages with a diverse multi-ethnic population, we were able to implement interface changes to make RealRisks accessible to users with varying health literacy and acculturation.",

        "Abstract": "Given the high prevalence (1 in 40) of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations among Ashkenazi Jews, population-based BRCA genetic testing in this ethnic subgroup may detect more mutation carriers. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among Orthodox Jewish women in New York City to assess breast cancer risk, genetic testing knowledge, self-efficacy, perceived breast cancer risk and worry, religious and cultural factors affecting medical decision-making. We used descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression models to identify predictors of genetic testing intention/uptake. Among evaluable respondents (n = 243, 53% response rate), median age was 25 and nearly half (43%) had a family history of breast cancer. Only 49% of the women had adequate genetic testing knowledge and 46% had accurate breast cancer risk perceptions. Five percent had already undergone BRCA genetic testing, 20% stated that they probably/definitely will get tested, 28% stated that they probably/definitely will not get tested, and 46% had not thought about it. High decision self-efficacy, adequate genetic testing knowledge, higher breast cancer risk, and overestimation of risk were associated with genetic testing intention/uptake. Decision support tools that improve knowledge and self-efficacy about genetic testing may facilitate population-based BRCA testing among Orthodox Jews.",

TLC DA can be delivered via web, smartphones and tablets. The system collects a significant amount of information that is used to generate tailored messages to consumers to persuade them in certain healthy lifestyles. One limitation is the necessity to collect vast amounts of information from users who manually enter. By identifying an optimal set of self-reported parameters we will be able to minimize the data entry burden of the app users. The study was to identify primary determinants of health behavior choices made by patients after using the system. Using discriminant analysis an optimal set of predictors was identified. The resulting set included smoking status, smoking cessation success estimate, self-efficacy, body mass index and diet status. Predicting smoking cessation choice was the most accurate, followed by weight management. Physical activity and diet choices were better identified in a combined cluster.",

The resulting set included smoking status, smoking cessation success estimate, self-efficacy, BMI and diet status. Prediction of smoking cessation choice was the most accurate (73%) followed by weight management choice (67%). Physical activity and diet choices were much better identified in a combined cluster (76%-87%) indicating that the decision about these two behaviors was affected by the same variables and the variables that could separate them may have been missing from the dataset. Presence of variables related to individual risks and levels of success in accepting certain health behaviors in the final set of predictors confirmed significance of the computer-mediated decision aid which presented these very variables for the user consideration.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify barriers and facilitators to patient-provider communication when discussing breast cancer risk to aid in the development of decision support tools. Four patient focus groups (N=34) and eight provider focus groups (N=10) took place in Northern Manhattan. A qualitative analysis was conducted using Atlas.ti software. The coding yielded 62.3%-94.5% agreement. The results showed that 1) barriers are time constraints, lack of knowledge, low health literacy, and language barriers, and 2) facilitators are information needs, desire for personalization, and autonomy when communicating risk in patient-provider encounters. These results will inform the development of a patient-centered decision aid (RealRisks) and a provider-facing breast cancer risk navigation (BNAV) tool, which are designed to facilitate patient-provider risk communication and shared decision-making about breast cancer prevention strategies, such as chemoprevention.",

Our objective was to translate the concept of CEHI into a usable and replicable informatics platform that will facilitate community-engaged practice and research. The setting is a diverse urban neighborhood in New York City. The methods included community asset mapping, stakeholder interviews, logic modeling, analysis of affordances in open-source tools, elicitation of use cases and requirements, and a survey of early adopters. Based on synthesis of data collected, GetHealthyHeigths.org (GHH) was developed using open-source LAMP stack and Drupal content management software. Drupal's organic groups module was used for novel participatory functionality, along with detailed user roles and permissions. Future work includes evaluation of GHH and its impact on agency and service networks. We plan to expand GHH with additional functionality to further support CEHI by combining informatics solutions with community engagement to improve health.",

Low levels of health literacy contribute to poor comprehension and undermine the confidence necessary for health self-management. Visualizations are useful for minimizing comprehension gaps when communicating complex quantitative information. The process of developing visualizations that accommodate the needs of individuals with varying levels of health literacy remains undefined. In this paper we provide detailed descriptions of a) an iterative methodological approach to the development of visualizations, b) the resulting types of visualizations and examples thereof, and c) the types of data the visualizations will be used to convey. We briefly describe subsequent phases in which the visualizations will be tested and refined. Web deployment of the final visualizations will support the ethical obligation to return the data to the research participants and community that contributed it.",

        "Abstract": "Personalized medicine is a model of healthcare that is predictive, personalized, preventive and participatory (\"P4 Medicine\"). Genetic counselors are an ideal group to study when designing tools to support cancer P4 Medicine activities more broadly. The goal for this work was to gain a better understanding of the information cancer genetic counselors seek from their patients to facilitate effective information exchange for discussing risk. This was an analysis of a qualitative data set from interviews of eight cancer genetic counselors, recruited from three institutions. Genetic counselors at each site were interviewed using a semi-structured, open-ended questionnaire. A selective coding approach was used to determine major themes associated with genetic counseling information needs for communicating risk. We generated a model for understanding categories of genetic counseling information needs to support risk communication activities. Common activities for risk communication included risk assessment and tailoring communication. Categories of information needs included: (a) clinical patient characteristics, (b) social and cognitive patient characteristics and (c) patient motivation and goals for the genetic counseling session. A logical next step is for this model to inform the design of software systems for pre-visit patient planning and delivering just-in-time educational information to facilitate cancer risk communication activities.",

        "Abstract": "Solutions are employed to support clinical research trial tasks in community-based practice settings. Using the IT Implementation Framework (ITIF), an integrative framework intended to guide the synthesis of theoretical perspectives for planning multi-level interventions to enhance IT use, we sought to understand the barriers and facilitators to clinical research in community-based practice settings preliminary to implementing new informatics solutions for improving clinical research infrastructure. The studies were conducted in practices within the Columbia University Clinical Trials Network. A mixed-method approach, including surveys, interviews, time-motion studies, and observations was used. The data collected, which incorporates predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors in IT use, were analyzed according to each phase of ITIF. Themes identified in the first phase of ITIF were 1) processes and tools to support clinical trial research and 2) clinical research peripheral to patient care processes. Not all of the problems under these themes were found to be amenable to IT solutions. Using the multi-level orientation of the ITIF, we set forth strategies beyond IT solutions that can have an impact on reengineering clinical research tasks in practice-based settings. Developing strategies to target enabling and reinforcing factors, which focus on organizational factors, and the motivation of the practice at large to use IT solutions to integrate clinical research tasks with patient care processes, is most challenging. The ITIF should be used to consider both IT and non-IT solutions concurrently for reengineering of clinical research in community-based practice settings.",

Optimal design may foster better patient comprehension and health literacy, which can improve health outcomes. We developed a patient-centric decision aid, Tailored Lifestyle Conversations (TLC), to help patients comprehend behavioral risks and set behavior change priorities for reducing risk of cardiovascular disease. The TLC decision aid was developed using a design framework based on Gestalt Principles of Perception. Further iteration was informed by qualitative user feedback. Preliminary analysis showed that the TLC decision aid helped patients understand their risk and supported their decisions on health behavior change. We identified design elements that supported patient comprehension, and other elements that were not effective, to inform iterative revision. This paper describes an effective methodology for the development of consumer health informatics tools that includes grounding in design principles complemented by iterative revision based on user testing and feedback.",

With this systematic literature review, complemented by key informant interviews, the authors sought to identify evidence regarding health IT and quality outcomes in URSs. The review included 105 peer-reviewed studies (2004-2009) in all settings. Only 15 studies included URSs, and 8 focused on URSs. Based on literature across settings, most evidence was available for quality impact of order entry, clinical decision support systems, and computerized reminders. Study designs were predominantly quasi-experimental (37%) or descriptive (35%); 90% of the studies focused on the microsystem level of quality improvement, indicating a need for expanding research into patient experience and organizational and environmental levels. Key informants highlighted organizational partnerships and health IT champions and emphasized that for health IT to have an impact on quality, there must be an organizational culture of quality improvement.",

        "Abstract": "Recent findings suggest that interactive game-like graphics might be useful in communicating probabilities. We developed a prototype for a risk communication module, focusing on eliciting users' preferences for different interactive graphics and assessing usability and user interpretations. Feedback from five focus groups was used to design the graphics. The final version displayed a matrix of square buttons; clicking on any button allowed the user to see whether the stick figure underneath was affected by the health outcome. When participants used this interaction to learn about a risk, they expressed more emotional responses, both positive and negative, than when viewing any static graphic or numerical description of a risk. Their responses included relief about small risks and concern about large risks. The groups also commented on static graphics: arranging the figures affected by disease randomly throughout a group of figures made it more difficult to judge the proportion affected but often was described as more realistic. Interactive graphics appear to have potential for expressing risk magnitude as well as the feeling of risk. This affective impact could be useful in increasing perceived threat of high risks, calming fears about low risks, or comparing risks. Quantitative studies are planned to assess the effect on perceived risks and estimated risk magnitudes.",

In this article, the summary of a workgroup discussion, we discuss key methods through which such web-based peer-to-peer communication may affect health promotion and disease prevention behavior (exchanges of information, emotional and instrumental support, and establishment of group norms and models). We also discuss several theoretical models for studying online peer communication, including social theory, health communication models, and health behavior models. Although online peer communication about health and disease is very common, research evaluating effects on health behaviors, mediators, and outcomes is still relatively sparse. We suggest that future research in this field should include formative evaluation and studies of effects on mediators of behavior change, behaviors, and outcomes. It also will be important to examine spontaneously emerging peer communication efforts to see how they can be integrated with theory-based efforts initiated by researchers.",

        "Abstract": "An important task performed during the analysis of health news coverage is the identification of news articles that are related to a specific health topic (e.g. obesity). This is often done using a combination of keyword searching and manual encoding of news content. Statistical language models and their evaluation metric, perplexity, may help to automate this task. A perplexity study of obesity news was performed to evaluate perplexity as a measure of the similarity of news corpora to obesity news content. The results of this study showed that perplexity increased as news coverage became more general relative to obesity news (obesity news approximately 187, general health news approximately 278, general news approximately 378, general news across multiple publishers approximately 382). This indicates that language model perplexity can measure the similarity news content to obesity news coverage, and could be used as the basis for an automated health news classifier.",

Behavioral and lifestyle changes could significantly reduce the burden of CVD, but provider counseling for behavior change is a very challenging, and often ineffective task. We have developed a patient-centric decision support tool to be incorporated into an Electronic Health Record system (EHR). The tool provides tailored feedback on behavioral risk, readiness and confidence in an effort to empower patients to make decisions about improving health behaviors. In turn, the tool will facilitate an informed and balanced discussion between patients and their providers about behavioral changes, incorporating both the clinical view and the individual's preferences for choosing among multiple behavior change goals based on their psychosocial characteristics, and evaluation of benefits and barriers.",

        "Abstract": "To explore how patients and providers respond to Tailored Lifestyle Conversations (TLC), an evidence-based decision aid to help patients set priorities for selecting among multiple health behavior change goals, we conducted a study utilizing key informant interviews. Based on patient level assessment data, TLC presents tailored outputs that include 1) behavioral and clinical risk; 2) readiness and confidence scores for changing each of four behaviors; and 3) qualitative equations to elicit patient priorities for change. Patient priorities are documented in an action plan to be discussed with their provider during a clinical encounter. Interview questions probed how patients and providers responded to this output, and how heavily they valued the chance of success versus health benefit in deciding which behavior to work on first. The interviews also revealed how TLC might mediate the conversation around behavior change between patients and providers. TLC has potential to drive a more evidence based and patient centric approach to behavioral counseling in clinical settings.",

        "Title": "Assessing the need for an online decision-support tool to promote evidence-based practices of psychosocial counseling in HIV care.",
        "Abstract": "Psychosocial counselors have a vital and challenging role in supporting persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH/A) to better manage their disease. However, gaps in training, education, and skills limit the effectiveness of counselors' efforts. We propose that the use of a decision-support tool for counselors at the point of care can support them in their work as well as help alleviate many training and practice gaps. Decision-support tools aimed at reducing knowledge and practice gaps are used extensively to assist clinical providers at the point of care; however, there is a need for decision-support tools designed specifically for HIV/AIDS counselors. To identify requirements for such a tool, we conducted a needs assessment through interviews of 19 HIV/AIDS clinic counselors who provide 20 or more hours per week of psychosocial support to PLWH/A. The assessment explored their education and training backgrounds, the extent to which evidence-based practices are implemented, and how a decision-support tool can support counselor work practices. Qualitative analysis was organized around seven main categories: counselor characteristics, patient characteristics, barriers, definitions of key concepts, use of guidelines, client assessments, and resources. The resulting coding schemes revealed knowledge and practice gaps among the interviewees, as well as barriers and challenges of counseling. Education and training background of the counseling staff varied widely. When asked to define five key concepts related to HIV counseling, 26-47% of respondents were unable to articulate an adequate definition. Less than half of the interviewees recalled sources of guidelines used in their work and specific models of care introduced during trainings. Interviews identified environmental barriers, language and literacy, patient education, and patient communication as the most prominent challenges to counseling work. The results from this study inform the need for and development of a decision-support tool to support the training and practices of HIV/AIDS counselors.",

This paper is part of a series of studies under the NIH Roadmap initiative, which examines workflow of clinical research in community practices. We describe three common work activities, detailing the main actors involved, the tools used and the challenges faced. These activities illustrate inefficiencies in the clinical research workflow which include: a) lack of supporting tools to perform routine work activities, b) redundancy, low reuse of data and poor interoperability between systems and c) the fragmented and distributed nature of the workflow. We identify opportunities for re-engineering at both a micro (activity) and macro level (organization).",

In developing a patient-centric electronic health record (PC-EHR), our project aims to build an evidence-based support system to facilitate patient-provider interaction, foster cooperative chronic disease management, and promote adherence to TLC guidelines by both providers and patients. In this paper we report on the findings of a modified Delphi method (MDM) study to determine the behavioral and psychosocial elements needed to extend the clinical data model and support the TLC decision support algorithm. An eight-member expert advisory committee reviewed a list of 83 proposed data elements including those from the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines and finalized a set of 30 data elements for inclusion. The MDM proved to be an effective approach for prioritizing data elements.",

Methods and results that begin with data collection and move onto elucidating requirements for the web portal are discussed. Sentiments of distrust in medical institutions, and the desire for community specific content and resources were among the needs emanating from our data analysis. These findings guided our decision to customize social software designed to foster connections, collaborations, flexibility, and interactivity; an \"architecture of participation\". While, we maintain that the leveraging of social software may indeed be the way to build healthy communities and support learning and engagement in underserved communities, our conclusion calls for careful thinking, testing and evaluation research to establish best practice models for leveraging these emerging technologies to support health improvements in the community.",

        "Abstract": "Descriptions of health risks in words, numbers, and graphics can all cause comprehension problems. Our novel risk communication tool involves a game-like interaction to allow users to experience the probability of a health event. The underlying principles are grounded in cognitive theory, but laboratory demonstrations do not guarantee usefulness in the real world. To help us create software on the basis of the theory, we have developed a qualitative method incorporating elements of focus groups and scenario-based usability testing in a community-based participatory research setting in Harlem, NY. In this procedure, a facilitator mediates discussion between software developers and community participants. Using this method, we have elicited guidance from focus groups and found that the interactive game appears to carry an emotional impact that static graphics do not. Additional testing is expected to help develop a useful risk communication tool and lead to richer understanding of lay models of health risk.",

In recent years, there has been a significant impetus for promoting the adoption of electronic health records, as evidenced by the numerous public and private initiatives across the United States. However, currently available electronic health records have not focused on the unique clinical, psychosocial, and health educational needs and requirements of the adolescent age group. In this chapter we discuss briefly the history, development, and adoption of electronic health records and provide examples of how electronic health records can be extended to focus on the needs of adolescents and those who care for them.",

Understanding end-users' workflow is critical to developing technology systems that are grounded in the context of the users' environment and are designed to fulfill their needs. Community practices are becoming the prevailing setting for conducting clinical research. Few studies have assessed clinical research workflow in such settings. We have conducted a series of investigations to model the workflow and have previously reported on some basic aspects of it, like the lack of information systems to support the workflow. In this paper we describe finer details of the workflow, using results of observational studies. These findings highlight the needs and inefficiencies that suggest the kind of information system that must be developed to enhance collaboration, communication and improve efficiency. This preliminary investigation also opens ground for more extensive studies to further elucidate the workflow.",

        "Abstract": "Framed messaging has emerged as an important means of promoting a number of health behaviors, including breast cancer screening. However, studies of message framing have infrequently considered race and income as possible moderators of framing effects, despite their importance to screening behavior. The current study examined whether demographic characteristics moderated participant responses to message framing. In the study, 102 Black and 42 White low-income, low-screening women were randomized to a loss, gain, or empowerment frame telephone intervention and re-contacted at 6 and 12 months. Contrary to expectation, there was no main effect for framing condition, although both loss and empowerment conditions elicited superior screening than the gain condition at 12 months. Income proved an important moderator of framing effects, interacting with both condition and race to influence screening. Message frames may differ in the amount of time they require to manifest in behavioral outcomes and may lead to changes in different screening outcomes. Understanding how framing effects vary as a function of key demographic characteristics such as race and income is likely to prove important as such variables facilitate targeting of frames.",

        "Abstract": "Current electronic health record systems are primarily clinical in focus, designed to provide patient-level data and provider-level decision support. Adapting EHR systems to serve public health needs provides the possibility of enormous advances for public health practice and policy. In this review, we evaluate EHR functionality and map it to the three core functions of public health: assessment, policy development, and assurance. In doing so, we identify and discuss important design, implementation, and methodological issues with current systems. For example, in order to support public health's traditional focus on preventive health and socio-behavioral factors, EHR data models would need to be expanded to incorporate environmental, psychosocial, and other non-medical data elements, and workflow would have to be examined to determine the optimal way of collecting these data. We also argue that redesigning EHR systems to support public health offers benefits not only to the public health system but also to consumers, health-care institutions, and individual providers.",

As the Internet grows and evolves as a powerful information medium, the ability to mine real-time news feeds for disease surveillance has become viable. We propose a system, GODSN that monitors global news for disease outbreaks and surveillance. The system processes real-time news feeds using natural language processing to obtain disease information and the geographical reference to plot them on a geographic information system. GODSN provides an effective approach to visualize the spatial and temporal trends of infectious disease outbreaks or disease specific developments.",

        "Abstract": "The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, The Community Health Care Association of New York State and Clinical Directors Network are collaborating on the \"eClinician Project,\" which has distributed seven hundred public health-friendly, wireless (WiFi) enabled Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) to primary care clinicians working in New York City, federally funded, Community Health Centers (CHC) which serve minority underserved communities that suffer a disproportionate burden of chronic disease and lack access to health promotion disease prevention services. Each participating health center also received a wireless router to create an onsite internet hot spot to enable clinicians to have internet access. The goals of the eClinician Project are to: 1) To encourage adoption of information technology among providers in Community Health Centers in New York City by providing PDAs as a first line strategy towards achieving this goal, 2) enhance access to information on emergency preparedness, 3) improve patient outcomes by providing PDA-based clinical decision-support tools that support evidence-based care, 4) encourage chronic care management and health promotion/disease prevention activities, and 5) increase productivity and efficiency. CHC clinicians have received a hands-on, on-site orientation to PDAs. Ongoing training has continued via online CME-accredited webcasts (see www.CDNetwork.org). Clinical decision-support tools are available for download via the eClinician project web portal (see www.eClinician.org ). Public health alerts can be delivered to the PDAs or to the clinicians' desktop computers. Pre and post training surveys, in addition to a case study, have been used to evaluate the population demographics, PDA adoption by the clinicians, clinician attitudes towards using PDAs, PDA influence on clinical-decision making and barriers to adoption of PDAs and information technology in general.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical research is vital to the translation of biomedical knowledge into standard clinical practice. Efforts are underway under the NIH Roadmap initiative to re-engineer the national research enterprise to sustain the rapid pace of innovation in the biomedical domain. As part of these efforts, we have embarked on an empirical evaluation of clinical research workflow in community practice settings. The reasons for this focus are three-fold. First, there is an increasing tendency by trial sponsors to conduct clinical trials in community, rather than academic, settings. Second, understanding workflow is critical to developing re-engineering strategies. Third, workflow associated with the conduct of clinical research in community practices have received virtually no attention in the scientific literature. In this paper, we describe a pilot study using time-motion observations, to determine the workflow of clinical research coordinators, the tools they use to conduct the constituent activities of those workflows, and their ultimate outcomes. The preliminary findings provide insights and understanding of clinical research workflow in community practice settings - knowledge that may significantly impact the way in which information technology based re-engineering can be deployed in such an environment.",

        "Abstract": "The future success of the translational research spectrum depends on the clinical research enterprise's ability to break through the barriers that constrain its productivity. As more basic science discoveries emerge, our ability to effectively translate this knowledge into improved patient care rests squarely on the manner in which we answer clinical questions. Informatics--the science of effective information use--is poised to help advance the conduct of science. However, incorporating informatics into the enterprise comes with its own set of challenges. To harness the benefits of improved information use, it is important to first establish how information flows within research. A thoughtful implementation of informatics--one that factors in social and organizational nuances--will undoubtedly lead to a more efficient and effective clinical research enterprise.",

        "Abstract": "This paper proposes a new model that provides assistance in understanding the reasons why individuals would use new ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) to perform a healthcare change in their lifestyle. Achieving a lifestyle change by the use of ICT is a multifold issue that can be broadly addressed by analysing, in parallel two dimensions: the individuals' attitude towards their health condition and their approach and readiness to monitor and change their attitude by the use of ICT. Our work has been to conceive and develop a model that explains the different stages the user is at both in terms of the perception of healthcare and of the use of technology to perform any desired or recommended change. In order to place the user at each dimension a set of questionnaires were designed and implemented. These questionnaires assisted us in understanding what personalised information needs to be provided according to the stage the user is at as well as to other variables (such as age, cultural background, etc). The novelty of this model is that it proposes a general framework that may be applied to the conception, design and evaluation of any e-health application. Moreover, it can be applied to different application targets (medical informatics, public health informatics, etc) and to different audiences (healthy individuals, patients, professionals, etc) as it proposes an enhanced user modelling process by taking into account both healthcare behaviour aspects as well as technological issues, which up to this moment, have not been taken into account and may be part of the explanation of e-health uptake failure in the healthcare field. The application of this model promotes the empowerment of the individuals by providing tailored information, as well as guidance, monitoring, through ICT and it will certainly make an impact on health-related behaviour. Besides, it will allow to understand some of the reasons of the success or failure of different e-health platforms. Overall, this model is likely to provide deeper insights into the process of improving e-health so it can meet ongoing individuals' needs and become an increasingly valued part of health care services.",

        "Abstract": "This review describes recent experimental and focus group research on graphics as a method of communication about quantitative health risks. Some of the studies discussed in this review assessed effect of graphs on quantitative reasoning, others assessed effects on behavior or behavioral intentions, and still others assessed viewers' likes and dislikes. Graphical features that improve the accuracy of quantitative reasoning appear to differ from the features most likely to alter behavior or intentions. For example, graphs that make part-to-whole relationships available visually may help people attend to the relationship between the numerator (the number of people affected by a hazard) and the denominator (the entire population at risk), whereas graphs that show only the numerator appear to inflate the perceived risk and may induce risk-averse behavior. Viewers often preferred design features such as visual simplicity and familiarity that were not associated with accurate quantitative judgments. Communicators should not assume that all graphics are more intuitive than text; many of the studies found that patients' interpretations of the graphics were dependent upon expertise or instruction. Potentially useful directions for continuing research include interactions with educational level and numeracy and successful ways to communicate uncertainty about risk.",

The primary objective of this working congress was to develop a framework for a national agenda in information and communication technology to enhance the health and health care of underserved populations. Discussions during four tracks addressed issues and trends in information and communication technologies for underserved populations, strategies learned from successful programs, evaluation methodologies for measuring the impact of informatics, and dissemination of information for replication of successful programs. Each track addressed current status, ideal state, barriers, strategies, and recommendations. Recommendations of the breakout sessions were summarized under the overarching themes of Policy, Funding, Research, and Education and Training. The general recommendations emphasized four key themes: revision in payment and reimbursement policies, integration of health care standards, partnerships as the key to success, and broad dissemination of findings including specific feedback to target populations and other key stakeholders.",

        "Abstract": "The HIV TIPS project will pilot and evaluate the use of web-based information technology on prescription errors and quality of care by providing tailored practice guidelines and patient education in ambulatory practice settings of the National AIDS Education and Training Centers (NAETC) network. In the first phase of the project, we tailored messages to guide patient adherence and self-care, using DHHS guidelines. We developed a method based on communication theory to ensure complete and effective messages.",

        "Title": "Grounding a new information technology implementation framework in behavioral science: a systematic analysis of the literature on IT use.",
        "Abstract": "Many interventions to improve the success of information technology (IT) implementations are grounded in behavioral science, using theories, and models to identify conditions and determinants of successful use. However, each model in the IT literature has evolved to address specific theoretical problems of particular disciplinary concerns, and each model has been tested and has evolved using, in most cases, a more or less restricted set of IT implementation procedures. Functionally, this limits the perspective for taking into account the multiple factors at the individual, group, and organizational levels that influence use behavior. While a rich body of literature has emerged, employing prominent models such as the Technology Adoption Model, Social-Cognitive Theory, and Diffusion of Innovation Theory, the complexity of defining a suitable multi-level intervention has largely been overlooked. A gap exists between the implementation of IT and the integration of theories and models that can be utilized to develop multi-level approaches to identify factors that impede usage behavior. We present a novel framework that is intended to guide synthesis of more than one theoretical perspective for the purpose of planning multi-level interventions to enhance IT use. This integrative framework is adapted from PRECEDE/PROCEDE, a conceptual framework used by health planners in hundreds of published studies to direct interventions that account for the multiple determinants of behavior. Since we claim that the literature on IT use behavior does not now include a multi-level approach, we undertook a systematic literature analysis to confirm this assertion. Our framework facilitated organizing this literature synthesis and our analysis was aimed at determining if the IT implementation approaches in the published literature were characterized by an approach that considered at least two levels of IT usage determinants. We found that while 61% of studies mentioned or referred to theory, none considered two or more levels. In other words, although the researchers employ behavioral theory, they omit two fundamental propositions: (1) IT usage is influenced by multiple factors and (2) interventions must be multi-dimensional. Our literature synthesis may provide additional insight into the reason for high failure rates associated with underutilized systems, and underscores the need to move beyond the current dominant approach that employs a single model to guide IT implementation plans that aim to address factors associated with IT acceptance and subsequent positive use behavior.",

        "Abstract": "This paper reports the effects of a tailored Web-based delivery system on self-efficacy as it relates to a patients' response to acute myocardial information (AMI) symptoms. The data reported are from MI-HEART, a randomized trial examining ways in which a clinical information system can favorably influence the appropriateness and rapidity of decision-making in patients suffering from symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. Participants were randomized into one of three groups: tailored Web-based, non-tailored Web-based and non-tailored paper based. A theoretically based behavioral-cognitive model was used to identify key variables upon which to tailor education material. A key variable in the model is self-efficacy, operationalized with a three-dimensional scaling. Results show trends in improved self-efficacy scores for all groups at 1-month follow up, with sustained significant increases in baseline to 3-month scores only in the tailored Web-based group. One possible explanation could be related to \"hit-count\", which was significantly higher in the tailored group. This study is a first step in quantifying the contribution of Web-based tailoring over non-tailoring in changing key determinants of patient delay to AMI symptoms.",
