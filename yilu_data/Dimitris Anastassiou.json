        "Abstract": "Subclonal reconstruction algorithms use bulk DNA sequencing data to quantify parameters of tumor evolution, allowing an assessment of how cancers initiate, progress and respond to selective pressures. We launched the ICGC-TCGA (International Cancer Genome Consortium-The Cancer Genome Atlas) DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling Tumor Heterogeneity and Evolution Challenge to benchmark existing subclonal reconstruction algorithms. This 7-year community effort used cloud computing to benchmark 31 subclonal reconstruction algorithms on 51 simulated tumors. Algorithms were scored on seven independent tasks, leading to 12,061 total runs. Algorithm choice influenced performance substantially more than tumor features but purity-adjusted read depth, copy-number state and read mappability were associated with the performance of most algorithms on most tasks. No single algorithm was a top performer for all seven tasks and existing ensemble strategies were unable to outperform the best individual methods, highlighting a key research need. All containerized methods, evaluation code and datasets are available to support further assessment of the determinants of subclonal reconstruction accuracy and development of improved methods to understand tumor evolution.",

        "Abstract": "Existing clustering methods for characterizing cell populations from single-cell RNA sequencing are constrained by several limitations stemming from the fact that clusters often cannot be homogeneous, particularly for transitioning populations. On the other hand, dominant cell populations within samples can be identified independently by their strong gene co-expression signatures using methods unrelated to partitioning. Here, we introduce a clustering method, CASCC (co-expression-assisted single-cell clustering), designed to improve biological accuracy using gene co-expression features identified using an unsupervised adaptive attractor algorithm. CASCC outperformed other methods as evidenced by multiple evaluation metrics, and our results suggest that CASCC can improve the analysis of single-cell transcriptomics, enabling potential new discoveries related to underlying biological mechanisms.",

This cell population has previously been labeled as consisting of inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts (iCAFs). The same signature characterizes naturally occurring fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) as well as stromal cells abundant in normal adipose tissue. Our analysis of human gene expression databases provides evidence that adipose stromal cells (ASCs) are recruited by tumors and undergo differentiation into CAFs during cancer progression to invasive and chemotherapy-resistant stages.",

        "Abstract": "Cancer aggressiveness has been linked with obesity, and studies have shown that adipose tissue can enhance cancer progression. In this issue of Cancer Research, Hosni and colleagues discover a paracrine mechanism mediated by adipocyte precursor cells through which urothelial carcinomas become resistant to erdafitinib, a recently approved therapy inhibiting fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR). They identified neuregulin 1 (NRG1) secreted by adipocyte precursor cells as an activator of HER3 signaling that enables resistance. The NRG1-mediated FGFR inhibitor resistance was amenable to intervention with pertuzumab, an antibody blocking the NRG1/HER3 axis. To investigate the nature of the resistance-associated NRG1-expressing cells in human patients, the authors analyzed published single-cell RNA sequencing data and observed that such cells appear in a cluster assigned as inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts (iCAF). Notably, the gene signature corresponding to these CAFs is highly similar to that shared by adipose stromal cells (ASC) in fat tissue and fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAP) in skeletal muscle of cancer-free individuals. Because fibroblasts with the ASC/FAP signature are enriched in various carcinomas, it is possible that the paracrine signaling conferred by NRG1 is a pan-cancer mechanism of FGFR inhibitor resistance and tumor aggressiveness.

        "Title": "Single-cell analysis reveals the pan-cancer invasiveness-associated transition of adipose-derived stromal cells into COL11A1-expressing cancer-associated fibroblasts.",
        "Abstract": "During the last ten years, many research results have been referring to a particular type of cancer-associated fibroblasts associated with poor prognosis, invasiveness, metastasis and resistance to therapy in multiple cancer types, characterized by a gene expression signature with prominent presence of genes COL11A1, THBS2 and INHBA. Identifying the underlying biological mechanisms responsible for their creation may facilitate the discovery of targets for potential pan-cancer therapeutics. Using a novel computational approach for single-cell gene expression data analysis identifying the dominant cell populations in a sequence of samples from patients at various stages, we conclude that these fibroblasts are produced by a pan-cancer cellular transition originating from a particular type of adipose-derived stromal cells naturally present in the stromal vascular fraction of normal adipose tissue, having a characteristic gene expression signature. Focusing on a rich pancreatic cancer dataset, we provide a detailed description of the continuous modification of the gene expression profiles of cells as they transition from APOD-expressing adipose-derived stromal cells to COL11A1-expressing cancer-associated fibroblasts, identifying the key genes that participate in this transition. These results also provide an explanation to the well-known fact that the adipose microenvironment contributes to cancer progression.",

        "Abstract": "We developed 2DImpute, an imputation method for correcting false zeros (known as dropouts) in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. It features preventing excessive correction by predicting the false zeros and imputing their values by making use of the interrelationships between both genes and cells in the expression matrix. We showed that 2DImpute outperforms several leading imputation methods by applying it on datasets from various scRNA-seq protocols.",

        "Abstract": "Bulk samples of the same patient are heterogeneous in nature, comprising of different subpopulations (subclones) of cancer cells. Cells in a tumor subclone are characterized by unique mutational genotype profile. Resolving tumor heterogeneity by estimating the genotypes, cellular proportions and the number of subclones present in the tumor can help in understanding cancer progression and treatment. We present a novel method, ChaClone2, to efficiently deconvolve the observed variant allele fractions (VAFs), with consideration for possible effects from copy number aberrations at the mutation loci. Our method describes a state-space formulation of the feature allocation model, deconvolving the observed VAFs from samples of the same patient into three matrices: subclonal total and variant copy numbers for mutated genes, and proportions of subclones in each sample. We describe an efficient sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm to estimate these matrices. Extensive simulation shows that the ChaClone2 yields better accuracy when compared with other state-of-the-art methods for addressing similar problem and it offers scalability to large datasets. Also, ChaClone2 features that the model parameter estimates can be refined whenever new mutation data of freshly sequenced genomic locations are available.

        "Abstract": "Tumor DNA sequencing data can be interpreted by computational methods that analyze genomic heterogeneity to infer evolutionary dynamics. A growing number of studies have used these approaches to link cancer evolution with clinical progression and response to therapy. Although the inference of tumor phylogenies is rapidly becoming standard practice in cancer genome analyses, standards for evaluating them are lacking. To address this need, we systematically assess methods for reconstructing tumor subclonality. First, we elucidate the main algorithmic problems in subclonal reconstruction and develop quantitative metrics for evaluating them. Then we simulate realistic tumor genomes that harbor all known clonal and subclonal mutation types and processes. Finally, we benchmark 580 tumor reconstructions, varying tumor read depth, tumor type and somatic variant detection. Our analysis provides a baseline for the establishment of gold-standard methods to analyze tumor heterogeneity.",

        "Abstract": "Tumors are heterogeneous in the sense that they consist of multiple subpopulations of cells, referred to as subclones, each of which is characterized by a distinct profile of genomic variations such as somatic mutations. Inferring the underlying clonal landscape has become an important topic in that it can help in understanding cancer development and progression, and thereby help in improving treatment. We describe a novel state-space model, based on the feature allocation framework and an efficient sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm, using the somatic mutation data obtained from tumor samples to estimate the number of subclones, as well as their characterization. Our approach, by design, is capable of handling any number of mutations. Via extensive simulations, our method exhibits high accuracy, in most cases, and compares favorably with existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrated the validity of our method through analyzing real tumor samples from patients from multiple cancer types (breast, prostate, and lung). Our results reveal driver mutation events specific to cancer types, and indicate clonal expansion by manual phylogenetic analysis.

        "Abstract": "Similar environmental risk factors have been implicated in different neuropsychiatric disorders (including major psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases), indicating the existence of common epigenetic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis shared by different illnesses. To investigate such commonality, we applied an unsupervised computational approach identifying several consensus co-expression and co-methylation signatures from a data cohort of postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples from individuals with six different neuropsychiatric disorders-schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, alcoholism, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's-as well as healthy controls. Among our results, we identified a pair of strongly interrelated co-expression and co-methylation (E-M) signatures showing consistent and significant disease association in multiple types of disorders. This E-M signature was enriched for interneuron markers, and we further demonstrated that it is unlikely for this enrichment to be due to varying subpopulation abundance of normal interneurons across samples. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis revealed overrepresentation of stress-related biological processes in this E-M signature. Our integrative analysis of expression and methylation profiles, therefore, suggests a stress-related epigenetic mechanism in the brain, which could be associated with the pathogenesis of multiple neuropsychiatric diseases.",

Specific driver mutations correlated with lower (CTNNB1, NRAS, or IDH1) or higher (BRAF, TP53, or CASP8) leukocyte levels across all cancers. Multiple control modalities of the intracellular and extracellular networks (transcription, microRNAs, copy number, and epigenetic processes) were involved in tumor-immune cell interactions, both across and within immune subtypes. Our immunogenomics pipeline to characterize these heterogeneous tumors and the resulting data are intended to serve as a resource for future targeted studies to further advance the field.",

        "Title": "Discovering Genome-Wide Tag SNPs Based on the Mutual Information of the Variants.",
        "Abstract": "Exploring linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns among the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites can improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of genomic association studies, whereby representative (tag) SNPs are identified to sufficiently represent the genomic diversity in populations. There has been considerable amount of effort in developing efficient algorithms to select tag SNPs from the growing large-scale data sets. Methods using the classical pairwise-LD and multi-locus LD measures have been proposed that aim to reduce the computational complexity and to increase the accuracy, respectively. The present work solves the tag SNP selection problem by efficiently balancing the computational complexity and accuracy, and improves the coverage in genomic diversity in a cost-effective manner. The employed algorithm makes use of mutual information to explore the multi-locus association between SNPs and can handle different data types and conditions. Experiments with benchmark HapMap data sets show comparable or better performance against the state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, as a novel application, the genome-wide SNP tagging is performed in the 1000 Genomes Project data sets, and produced a well-annotated database of tagging variants that capture the common genotype diversity in 2,504 samples from 26 human populations. Compared to conventional methods, the algorithm requires as input only the genotype (or haplotype) sequences, can scale up to genome-wide analyses, and produces accurate solutions with more information-rich output, providing an improved platform for researchers towards the subsequent association studies.",

        "Abstract": "Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a fatal hematological cancer. The genetic abnormalities underlying AML are extremely heterogeneous among patients, making prognosis and treatment selection very difficult. While clinical proteomics data has the potential to improve prognosis accuracy, thus far, the quantitative means to do so have yet to be developed. Here we report the results and insights gained from the DREAM 9 Acute Myeloid Prediction Outcome Prediction Challenge (AML-OPC), a crowdsourcing effort designed to promote the development of quantitative methods for AML prognosis prediction. We identify the most accurate and robust models in predicting patient response to therapy, remission duration, and overall survival. We further investigate patient response to therapy, a clinically actionable prediction, and find that patients that are classified as resistant to therapy are harder to predict than responsive patients across the 31 models submitted to the challenge. The top two performing models, which held a high sensitivity to these patients, substantially utilized the proteomics data to make predictions. Using these models, we also identify which signaling proteins were useful in predicting patient therapeutic response.",

        "Abstract": "Genetic studies of type 1 diabetes (T1D) have identified 50 susceptibility regions, finding major pathways contributing to risk, with some loci shared across immune disorders. To make genetic comparisons across autoimmune disorders as informative as possible, a dense genotyping array, the Immunochip, was developed, from which we identified four new T1D-associated regions (P < 5 \u00d7 10(-8)). A comparative analysis with 15 immune diseases showed that T1D is more similar genetically to other autoantibody-positive diseases, significantly most similar to juvenile idiopathic arthritis and significantly least similar to ulcerative colitis, and provided support for three additional new T1D risk loci. Using a Bayesian approach, we defined credible sets for the T1D-associated SNPs. The associated SNPs localized to enhancer sequences active in thymus, T and B cells, and CD34(+) stem cells. Enhancer-promoter interactions can now be analyzed in these cell types to identify which particular genes and regulatory sequences are causal.",

        "Abstract": "Copy number variations (CNVs) are abundant in the human genome. They have been associated with complex traits in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expected to continue playing an important role in identifying the etiology of disease phenotypes. As a result of current high throughput whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, we currently have datasets that simultaneously have integer copy numbers in CNV regions as well as SNP genotypes. At the same time, haplotypes that have been shown to offer advantages over genotypes in identifying disease traits even though available for SNP genotypes are largely not available for CNV/SNP data due to insufficient computational tools. We introduce a new framework for inferring haplotypes in CNV/SNP data using a sequential Monte Carlo sampling scheme 'Tree-Based Deterministic Sampling CNV' (TDSCNV). We compare our method with polyHap(v2.0), the only currently available software able to perform inference in CNV/SNP genotypes, on datasets of varying number of markers. We have found that both algorithms show similar accuracy but TDSCNV is an order of magnitude faster while scaling linearly with the number of markers and number of individuals and thus could be the method of choice for haplotype inference in such datasets. Our method is implemented in the TDSCNV package which is available for download at http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~anastas/tdscnv.",

        "Title": "JAK2 expression is associated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and improved breast cancer outcomes: implications for evaluating JAK2 inhibitors.",
        "Abstract": "Janus kinase-2 (JAK2) supports breast cancer growth, and clinical trials testing JAK2 inhibitors are under way. In addition to the tumor epithelium, JAK2 is also expressed in other tissues including immune cells; whether the JAK2 mRNA levels in breast tumors correlate with outcomes has not been evaluated. Using a case-control design, JAK2 mRNA was measured in 223 archived breast tumors and associations with distant recurrence were evaluated by logistic regression. The frequency of correct pairwise comparisons of patient rankings based on JAK2 levels versus survival outcomes, the concordance index (CI), was evaluated using data from 2,460 patients in three cohorts. In the case-control study, increased JAK2 was associated with a decreasing risk of recurrence (multivariate P = 0.003, n = 223). Similarly, JAK2 was associated with a protective CI (<0.5) in the public cohorts: NETHERLANDS CI = 0.376, n = 295; METABRIC CI = 0.462, n = 1,981; OSLOVAL CI = 0.452, n = 184. Furthermore, JAK2 was strongly correlated with the favorable prognosis LYM metagene signature for infiltrating T cells (r = 0.5; P < 2 \u00d7 10(-16); n = 1,981) and with severe lymphocyte infiltration (P = 0.00003, n = 156). Moreover, the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib potently inhibited the anti-CD3-dependent production of IFN-\u03b3, a marker of the differentiation of Th cells along the tumor-inhibitory Th1 pathway. The potential for JAK2 inhibitors to interfere with the antitumor capacities of T cells should be evaluated.",

In DNA pooling, equimolar amounts of DNA from different individuals are mixed into one sample and the frequency of each allele in each position is observed in a single genotype experiment. The identification of haplotype frequencies from pooled data in addition to single locus analysis is of separate interest within these studies as haplotypes could increase statistical power and provide additional insight.",

        "Abstract": "The accuracy with which cancer phenotypes can be predicted by selecting and combining molecular features is compromised by the large number of potential features available. In an effort to design a robust prognostic model to predict breast cancer survival, we hypothesized that signatures consisting of genes that are coexpressed in multiple cancer types should correspond to molecular events that are prognostic in all cancers, including breast cancer. We previously identified several such signatures--called attractor metagenes--in an analysis of multiple tumor types. We then tested our attractor metagene hypothesis as participants in the Sage Bionetworks-DREAM Breast Cancer Prognosis Challenge. Using a rich training data set that included gene expression and clinical features for breast cancer patients, we developed a prognostic model that was independently validated in a newly generated patient data set. We describe our model, which was based on three attractor metagenes associated with mitotic chromosomal instability, mesenchymal transition, or lymphocyte-based immune recruitment.",

        "Abstract": "Mining gene expression profiles has proven valuable for identifying signatures serving as surrogates of cancer phenotypes. However, the similarities of such signatures across different cancer types have not been strong enough to conclude that they represent a universal biological mechanism shared among multiple cancer types. Here we present a computational method for generating signatures using an iterative process that converges to one of several precise attractors defining signatures representing biomolecular events, such as cell transdifferentiation or the presence of an amplicon. By analyzing rich gene expression datasets from different cancer types, we identified several such biomolecular events, some of which are universally present in all tested cancer types in nearly identical form. Although the method is unsupervised, we show that it often leads to attractors with strong phenotypic associations. We present several such multi-cancer attractors, focusing on three that are prominent and sharply defined in all cases: a mesenchymal transition attractor strongly associated with tumor stage, a mitotic chromosomal instability attractor strongly associated with tumor grade, and a lymphocyte-specific attractor.",

        "Abstract": "Many large genome-wide association studies include nuclear families with more than one child (trio families), allowing for analysis of differences between siblings (sib pair analysis). Statistical power can be increased when haplotypes are used instead of genotypes. Currently, haplotype inference in families with more than one child can be performed either using the familial information or statistical information derived from the population samples but not both. Building on our recently proposed tree-based deterministic framework (TDS) for trio families, we augment its applicability to general nuclear families. We impose a minimum recombinant approach locally and independently on each multiple children family, while resorting to the population-derived information to solve the remaining ambiguities. Thus our framework incorporates all available information (familial and population) in a given study. We demonstrate that using all the constraints in our approach we can have gains in the accuracy as opposed to breaking the multiple children families to separate trios and resorting to a trio inference algorithm or phasing each family in isolation. We believe that our proposed framework could be the method of choice for haplotype inference in studies that include nuclear families with multiple children.

        "Abstract": "Gene expression profiling has provided insights into different cancer types and revealed tissue-specific expression signatures. Alterations in microRNA expression contribute to the pathogenesis of many types of human diseases. Few studies have integrated all levels of gene expression, miRNA and methylation to uncover correlations between these data types. We performed an integrated profiling to discover instances of miRNAs associated with a gene expression and DNA methylation signature across multiple cancer types. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we revealed a concordant gene expression and methylation signature associated with the microRNA hsa-miR-142 across the same samples. In all cancer types examined, we found a signature of co-expression of a gene set R and methylated sites M, which correlate positively (M+) or negatively (M-) with the expression of hsa-miR-142. The set R consistently contains many genes, such as TRAF3IP3, NCKAP1L, CD53, LAPTM5, PTPRC, EVI2B, DOCK2, LCP2, CYBB and FYB. The signature is preserved across glioblastoma, ovarian, breast, colon, kidney, lung, uterine and rectum cancer. There is 28% overlap of methylation sites in M between glioblastoma (GBM) and ovarian cancer. There is 60% overlap of genes in R between GBM and ovarian (P = 1.3e(-11)). Most of the genes in R are known to be expressed in lymphocytes and haematopoietic stem cells, while M reflects membrane proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion functions. We speculate that the hsa-miR-142 associated signature may signal haematopoietic-specific processes and an accumulation of methylation events triggering a progressive loss of cell-cell adhesion. We also observed that GBM samples belonging to the proneural subtype tend to have underexpressed hsa-miR-142 and R genes, hypomethylated M+ and hypermethylated M-, while the mesenchymal samples have the opposite profile.",

        "Abstract": "A stage-associated gene expression signature of coordinately expressed genes, including the transcription factor Slug (SNAI2) and other epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers has been found present in samples from publicly available gene expression datasets in multiple cancer types, including nonepithelial cancers. The expression levels of the co-expressed genes vary in a continuous and coordinate manner across the samples, ranging from absence of expression to strong co-expression of all genes. These data suggest that tumor cells may pass through an EMT-like process of mesenchymal transition to varying degrees. Here we show that, in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), this signature is associated with time to recurrence following initial treatment. By analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we found that GBM patients who responded to therapy and had long time to recurrence had low levels of the signature in their tumor samples (P\u200a=\u200a3\u00d710(-7)). We also found that the signature is strongly correlated in gliomas with the putative stem cell marker CD44, and is highly enriched among the differentially expressed genes in glioblastomas vs. lower grade gliomas. Our results suggest that long delay before tumor recurrence is associated with absence of the mesenchymal transition signature, raising the possibility that inhibiting this transition might improve the durability of therapy in glioma patients.",

        "Abstract": "Analysis of large gene expression data sets in the presence and absence of a phenotype can lead to the selection of a group of genes serving as biomarkers jointly predicting the phenotype. Among gene selection methods, filter methods derived from ranked individual genes have been widely used in existing products for diagnosis and prognosis. Univariate filter approaches selecting genes individually, although computationally efficient, often ignore gene interactions inherent in the biological data. On the other hand, multivariate approaches selecting gene subsets are known to have a higher risk of selecting spurious gene subsets due to the overfitting of the vast number of gene subsets evaluated. Here we propose a framework of statistical significance tests for multivariate feature selection that can reduce the risk of selecting spurious gene subsets. Using three existing data sets, we show that our proposed approach is an essential step to identify such a gene set that is generated by a significant interaction of its members, even improving classification performance when compared to established approaches. This technique can be applied for the discovery of robust biomarkers for medical diagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes HLA-DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 are the strongest genetic factors for type 1 diabetes (T1D). Additional loci in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are difficult to identify due to the region's high gene density and complex linkage disequilibrium (LD). To facilitate the association analysis, two novel algorithms were implemented in this study: one for phasing the multi-allelic HLA genotypes in trio families, and one for partitioning the HLA strata in conditional testing. Screening and replication were performed on two large and independent datasets: the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) dataset of 2,000 cases and 1,504 controls, and the T1D Genetics Consortium (T1DGC) dataset of 2,300 nuclear families. After imputation, the two datasets have 1,941 common SNPs in the MHC, of which 22 were successfully tested and replicated based on the statistical testing stratifying on the detailed DRB1 and DQB1 genotypes. Further conditional tests using the combined dataset confirmed eight novel SNP associations around 31.3 Mb on chromosome 6 (rs3094663, p = 1.66 \u00d7 10(-11) and rs2523619, p = 2.77 \u00d7 10(-10) conditional on the DR/DQ genotypes). A subsequent LD analysis established TCF19, POU5F1, CCHCR1 and PSORS1C1 as potential causal genes for the observed association.",

Existing algorithms use the pairwise correlations of the expression levels of genes, which provide valuable but insufficient information for the inference of regulatory interactions. Here we present a computational approach based on the recently developed context likelihood of related (CLR) algorithm, extracting additional complementary information using the information theoretic measure of synergy and assigning a score to each ordered pair of genes measuring the degree of confidence that the first gene regulates the second. When tested on a set of publicly available Escherichia coli gene-expression data with known assumed ground truth, the synergy augmented CLR (SA-CLR) algorithm had significantly improved prediction performance when compared to CLR. There is also enhanced potential for biological discovery as a result of the identification of the most likely synergistic partner genes involved in the interactions.",

        "Abstract": "It has been shown that electropherograms of DNA sequences can be modeled with hidden Markov models. Basecalling, the procedure that determines the sequence of bases from the given eletropherogram, can then be performed using the Viterbi algorithm. A training step is required prior to basecalling in order to estimate the HMM parameters. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach which employs the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to perform basecalling. Such an approach not only allows one to naturally encode the prior biological knowledge into the basecalling algorithm, it also exploits both the training data and the basecalling data in estimating the HMM parameters, leading to more accurate estimates. Using the recently sequenced genome of the organism Legionella pneumophila we show that the MCMC basecaller outperforms the state-of-the-art basecalling algorithm in terms of total errors while requiring much less training than other proposed statistical basecallers.",

        "Abstract": "Diseases such as cancer are often related to collaborative effects involving interactions of multiple genes within complex pathways, or to combinations of multiple SNPs. To understand the structure of such mechanisms, it is helpful to analyze genes in terms of the purely cooperative, as opposed to independent, nature of their contributions towards a phenotype. Here, we present an information-theoretic analysis that provides a quantitative measure of the multivariate synergy and decomposes sets of genes into submodules each of which contains synergistically interacting genes. When the resulting computational tools are used for the analysis of gene expression or SNP data, this systems-based methodology provides insight into the biological mechanisms responsible for disease.",

        "Title": "Inference of disease-related molecular logic from systems-based microarray analysis.",
        "Abstract": "Computational analysis of gene expression data from microarrays has been useful for medical diagnosis and prognosis. The ability to analyze such data at the level of biological modules, rather than individual genes, has been recognized as important for improving our understanding of disease-related pathways. It has proved difficult, however, to infer pathways from microarray data by deriving modules of multiple synergistically interrelated genes, rather than individual genes. Here we propose a systems-based approach called Entropy Minimization and Boolean Parsimony (EMBP) that identifies, directly from gene expression data, modules of genes that are jointly associated with disease. Furthermore, the technique provides insight into the underlying biomolecular logic by inferring a logic function connecting the joint expression levels in a gene module with the outcome of disease. Coupled with biological knowledge, this information can be useful for identifying disease-related pathways, suggesting potential therapeutic approaches for interfering with the functions of such pathways. We present an example providing such gene modules associated with prostate cancer from publicly available gene expression data, and we successfully validate the results on additional independently derived data. Our results indicate a link between prostate cancer and cellular damage from oxidative stress combined with inhibition of apoptotic mechanisms normally triggered by such damage.",

        "Abstract": "The intrinsic dynamic response of a transcriptional regulatory network depends directly on molecular interactions in the cellular transcription, translation, and degradation machineries. These interactions can be incorporated into dynamic mathematical models of the biochemical system using the biophysical relationship with the model parameters. Modifications of such interactions bring changes to the biological behavior of the cells, and therefore, many normal and pathological cellular states depend on them. It is important for analysis, prediction, diagnosis, and treatment of cellular function to have an experimentally derived model with parameters that adequately represent the molecular interactions of interest. Finding the model and parameters of a transcriptional regulatory network is a difficult task that has been approached at different levels and with different techniques. We develop here a new analysis method (based on previous work on network inference, modeling, and parameter identification) that finds the most changed parameters from yeast oligonucleotide microarray expression patterns in cases where a phenotype difference exists between two samples. We then relate and examine the changed parameters with their associated genes, corresponding genetic functional categories, and particular subnetworks and connectivities. The biophysical bases for these changes are also identified by studying the relationship of the changed parameters with the transcription, translation, and degradation mechanisms. The method is improved to cases where there are two or more transcription factors influencing transcription, and a statistical analysis is performed to give a measurement of the uniqueness and robustness of the parameter fit.",

Presented here is the design of tools for the evaluation of the network's model structure and parameters. The most effective tools are found to be based on evolution strategies. We evaluate models of increasing complexity, from lumped, algebraic phenomenological models to Hill functions and thermodynamically derived functions. These last functions provide the free energies of binding of transcription factors to their operators, as well as cooperativity energies. Optimization results based on published experimental data from a synthetic network in Escherichia coli are presented. The free energies of binding and cooperativity found by our tools are in the same physiological ranges as those experimentally derived in the bacteriophage lambda system. We also use time-series data from high-density oligonucleotide microarrays of yeast meiotic expression patterns. The algorithm appropriately finds the parameters of pairs of regulated regulatory yeast genes, showing that for related genes an overall reasonable computation effort is sufficient to find the strength and causality of the connectivity of large numbers of them.",
