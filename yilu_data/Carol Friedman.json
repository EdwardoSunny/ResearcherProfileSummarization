        "Abstract": "Manually curating standardized phenotypic concepts such as Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms from narrative text in electronic health records (EHRs) is time consuming and error prone. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate automated phenotype extraction and thus improve the efficiency of curating clinical phenotypes from clinical texts. While individual NLP systems can perform well for a single cohort, an ensemble-based method might shed light on increasing the portability of NLP pipelines across different cohorts.",

        "Abstract": "This study used Amazon Mechanical Turk to crowdsource public opinions about sharing medical records for clinical research. The 1,508 valid respondents comprised 58.7% males, 54% without college degrees, 41.5% students or unemployed, and 84.3% under 40 years old. More than 74% were somewhat willing to share de-identified records. Education level, employment status, and gender were identified as significant predictors of willingness to share one's own or one's family's medical records (partially identifiable, completely identifiable, or de-identified). Thematic analysis applied to respondent comments uncovered barriers to sharing, including the inability to track uses and users of their information, potential harm (such as identity theft or healthcare denial), lack of trust, and worries about information misuse. Our study suggests that implementing reliable medical record de-identification and emphasizing trust development are essential to addressing such concerns. Amazon Mechanical Turk proved cost-effective for collecting public opinions with short surveys.",

        "Abstract": "This study investigated the automated detection of antiretroviral toxicities in structured electronic health records data. The evaluation compared responses generated by 5 clinical pharmacists and 1 prototype knowledge-based application for 15 randomly selected test cases. The main outcomes were inter-subject dissimilarity of responses quantified by the Jaccard distance, and the mean proportion of correct responses by each subject. The statistical differences in inter-subject Jaccard distances suggested that the prototype was inferior to clinical pharmacists in the detection of possible antiretroviral toxicity associations from structured data. The reason for dissimilarities was attributable to inadequate domain coverage by the prototype. The differences in the mean proportion of correct responses between the clinical pharmacists and the prototype were statistically indistinguishable. Overall, this study suggests that knowledge-based applications have the potential to support automated detection of antiretroviral toxicities from structured patient records. Furthermore, the study demonstrates a systematic approach for validating such applications quantitatively.",

As a rich source of phenotype information, electronic health records (EHRs) promise to empower diagnostic variant interpretation. However, how to accurately and efficiently extract phenotypes from heterogeneous EHR narratives remains a challenge. Here, we present EHR-Phenolyzer, a high-throughput EHR framework for extracting and analyzing phenotypes. EHR-Phenolyzer extracts and normalizes Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts from EHR narratives and then prioritizes genes with causal variants on the basis of the HPO-coded phenotype manifestations. We assessed EHR-Phenolyzer on 28 pediatric individuals with confirmed diagnoses of monogenic diseases and found that the genes with causal variants were ranked among the top 100 genes selected by EHR-Phenolyzer for 16/28 individuals (p < 2.2\u00a0\u00d7 10",

        "Abstract": "Medication regimen may be optimized based on individual drug efficacy identified by pharmacogenomic testing. However, majority of current pharmacogenomic decision support tools provide assessment only of single drug-gene interactions without taking into account complex drug-drug and drug-drug-gene interactions which are prevalent in people with polypharmacy and can result in adverse drug events or insufficient drug efficacy. The main objective of this project was to develop comprehensive pharmacogenomic decision support for medication risk assessment in people with polypharmacy that simultaneously accounts for multiple drug and gene effects. To achieve this goal, the project addressed two aims: (1) development of comprehensive knowledge repository of actionable pharmacogenes; (2) introduction of scoring approaches reflecting potential adverse effect risk levels of complex medication regimens accounting for pharmacogenomic polymorphisms and multiple drug metabolizing pathways. After pharmacogenomic knowledge repository was introduced, a scoring algorithm has been built and pilot-tested using a limited data set. The resulting total risk score for frequently hospitalized older adults with polypharmacy (72.04\u00b117.84) was statistically significantly different (p<0.05) from the total risk score for older adults with polypharmacy with low hospitalization rate (8.98\u00b12.37). An initial prototype assessment demonstrated feasibility of our approach and identified steps for improving risk scoring algorithms.",

        "Abstract": "Pharmacogenetics-related publications, which are increasing rapidly, provide important new pharmacogenetics knowledge. Automated approaches to extract information of new alleles and to identify their impact on metabolic phenotypes from publications are urgently needed to facilitate personalized medicine and improve clinical outcomes. Cytochrome polymorphisms, responsible for a wide variation of drug pharmacodynamics, individual efficacy and adverse effects, have significant potential for optimizing drug therapy. A few studies have addressed specialized efforts to automatically extract cytochrome polymorphisms and their characterizations regarding metabolic phenotypes from the literature. In this paper, we present a novel rule-based text-mining system to extract metabolic phenotypes of polymorphisms from PubMed abstracts with a focus on cytochrome P450. This system is promising as it achieved a precision of 85.71% in a preliminary proof-of-concept evaluation and is expected to automatically provide up-to-date metabolic information for cytochrome polymorphisms, which is critical to advance personalized medicine and improve clinical care.",

They are considered the cause of many adverse drug effects exposing patients to higher risks and increasing public health system costs. Methods to follow-up and discover possible DDIs causing harm to the population are a primary aim of drug safety researchers. Here, we review different methodologies and recent advances using data mining to detect DDIs with impact on patients. We focus on data mining of different pharmacovigilance sources, such as the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System and electronic health records from medical institutions, as well as on the diverse data mining studies that use narrative text available in the scientific biomedical literature and social media. We pay attention to the strengths but also further explain challenges related to these methods. Data mining has important applications in the analysis of DDIs showing the impact of the interactions as a cause of adverse effects, extracting interactions to create knowledge data sets and gold standards and in the discovery of novel and dangerous DDIs.",

        "Abstract": "Pharmacogenetic testing identifies genetic biomarkers that are predictive of individual sensitivity to particular drugs. A significant proportion of medications that are widely prescribed for older adults are metabolized by enzymes that are encoded by highly polymorphic genes. Pharmacogenetic testing is increasingly used to optimize the medication regimen; however, its potential in older adults with polypharmacy has not been systematically explored. Following the initial case-series study, this study hypothesized that frequently hospitalized older adults with polypharmacy have higher frequency of pharmacogenetic polymorphism as compared to older adults with polypharmacy who are rarely admitted to a hospital. To test this hypothesis, a nested case-control study was conducted with pharmacogenetic polymorphism as an exposure and hospitalization rate as an outcome. In this study, frequently hospitalized older adults (\u226565 years of age) with polypharmacy were matched with rarely hospitalized older adults with poly-pharmacy by age, gender, race, ethnicity, and chronic disease score. Average age and number of prescription drugs did not differ in cases and controls (77.2\u00b15.0 and 78.3\u00b15.1 years, 14.3\u00b15.3 and 14.0\u00b12.9 medications, respectively). No statistically significant difference in sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics that are known to affect hospitalization risk was found between the cases and controls. Major pharmacogenetic polymorphism defined as presence of at least one allelic combination resulting in poor or rapid metabolizer status was identified in all the cases. No major pharmacogenetic polymorphisms were detected in controls. Based on the exact McNemar's test, the difference in major pharmacogenetic polymorphism frequency between cases and controls was statistically significant (",

        "Abstract": "Recent research has suggested that the case-control study design, unlike the self-controlled study design, performs poorly in controlling confounding in the detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from administrative claims and electronic health record (EHR) data, resulting in biased estimates of the causal effects of drugs on health outcomes of interest (HOI) and inaccurate confidence intervals. Here we show that using rich data on comorbidities and automatic variable selection strategies for selecting confounders can better control confounding within a case-control study design and provide a more solid basis for inference regarding the causal effects of drugs on HOIs. Four HOIs are examined: acute kidney injury, acute liver injury, acute myocardial infarction and gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. For each of these HOIs we use a previously published reference set of positive and negative control drugs to evaluate the performance of our methods. Our methods have AUCs that are often substantially higher than the AUCs of a baseline method that only uses demographic characteristics for confounding control. Our methods also give confidence intervals for causal effect parameters that cover the expected no effect value substantially more often than this baseline method. The case-control study design, unlike the self-controlled study design, can be used in the fairly typical setting of EHR databases without longitudinal information on patients. With our variable selection method, these databases can be more effectively used for the detection of ADRs.",

        "Abstract": "An automated, user-friendly and accurate system for retrieving herb-drug interaction (HDIs) related articles in MEDLINE can increase the safety of patients, as well as improve the physicians' article retrieving ability regarding speed and experience. Previous studies show that MeSH based queries associated with negative effects of drugs can be customized, resulting in good performance in retrieving relevant information, but no study has focused on the area of herb-drug interactions (HDI). This paper adapted the characteristics of HDI related papers and created a multilayer HDI article searching system. It achieved a sensitivity of 92% at a precision of 93% in a preliminary evaluation. Instead of requiring physicians to conduct PubMed searches directly, this system applies a more user-friendly approach by employing a customized system that enhances PubMed queries, shielding users from having to write queries, dealing with PubMed, or reading many irrelevant articles. The system provides automated processes and outputs target articles based on the input.",

        "Abstract": "Academic literature provides rich and up-to-date information concerning adverse drug reactions (ADR), but it is time consuming and labor intensive for physicians to obtain information of ADRs from academic literature because they would have to generate queries, review retrieved articles and summarize the results. In this study, a method is developed to automatically detect and summarize ADRs from journal articles, rank them and present them to physicians in a user-friendly interface. The method studied ADRs for 6 drugs and returned on average 4.8 ADRs that were correct. The results demonstrated this method was feasible and effective. This method can be applied in clinical practice for assisting physicians to efficiently obtain information about ADRs associated with specific drugs. Automated summarization of ADR information from recent publications may facilitate translation of academic research into actionable information at point of care.",

        "Title": "Potential utility of precision medicine for older adults with polypharmacy: a case series study.",
        "Abstract": "Pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing has been increasingly used to optimize drug regimens; however, its potential in older adults with polypharmacy has not been systematically studied. In this hypothesis-generating study, we employed a case series design to explore potential utility of PGx testing in older adults with polypharmacy and to highlight barriers in implementing this methodology in routine clinical practice. Three patients with concurrent chronic heart and lung disease aged 74, 78, and 83 years and whose medication regimen comprised 26, 17, and 18 drugs, correspondingly, served as cases for this study. PGx testing identified major genetic polymorphisms in the first two cases. The first case was identified as \"CYP3A4/CYP3A5 poor metabolizer\", which affected metabolism of eleven prescribed drugs. The second case had \"CYP2D6 rapid metabolizer\" status affecting three prescribed medications, two of which were key drugs for managing this patient's chronic conditions. Both these patients also had VKORC1 allele *A, resulting in higher sensitivity to warfarin. All cases demonstrated a significant number of potential drug-drug interactions. Both patients with significant drug-gene interactions had a history of frequent hospitalizations (six and 23, respectively), whereas the person without impaired cytochrome P450 enzyme activity had only two acute episodes in the last 5 years, although he was older and had multiple comorbidities. Since all patients received guideline-concordant therapy from the same providers and were adherent to their drug regimen, we hypothesized that genetic polymorphism may represent an additional risk factor for higher hospitalization rates in older adults with polypharmacy. However, evidence to support or reject this hypothesis is yet to be established. Studies evaluating clinical impact of PGx testing in older adults with polypharmacy are warranted. For practical implementation of pharmacogenomics in routine clinical care, besides providing convincing evidence of its clinical effectiveness, multiple barriers must be addressed. Introduction of intelligent clinical decision support in electronic medical record systems is required to address complexities of simultaneous drug-gene and drug-drug interactions in older adults with polypharmacy. Physician training, clear clinical pathways, evidence-based guidelines, and patient education materials are necessary for unlocking full potential of pharmacogenomics into routine clinical care of older adults.",

        "Abstract": "Co-administration of drugs is a primary cause of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) and a drain on the health care industry costing billions of dollars and reducing quality of life. Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) account for as much as 30% of all ADRs. Unfortunately, DDIs are not systematically explored pre-clinically and are difficult to detect in post-marketing drug surveillance. For this reason, the detection and prediction of DDIs is an important problem in both drug development and pharmacovigilance. The comparison of the 3D drug structures provides a powerful tool for DDI prediction. In this article, we present the first large scale model for predicting DDIs using the drug's 3D molecular structure. In addition to identifying putative drug interactions we can also isolate the pharmacological or clinical effect associated with the predicted interactions. The model has good performance in two different hold-out validations and in external test sets. We found that the top scored drug pairs were significantly enriched for known clinically relevant interactions and that 3D structure data is providing significantly independent information from other approaches, including 2D structure (p=0.003). We demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed methodology to systematically identify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions, provided an exploratory tool that can be used for patient safety and pre-clinical toxicity screening, and reviewed the state of the art methods used to detect DDIs.",

DDI detection is, therefore, an important objective in patient safety, one whose pursuit affects drug development and pharmacovigilance. In this article, we describe a protocol applicable on a large scale to predict novel DDIs based on similarity of drug interaction candidates to drugs involved in established DDIs. The method integrates a reference standard database of known DDIs with drug similarity information extracted from different sources, such as 2D and 3D molecular structure, interaction profile, target and side-effect similarities. The method is interpretable in that it generates drug interaction candidates that are traceable to pharmacological or clinical effects. We describe a protocol with applications in patient safety and preclinical toxicity screening. The time frame to implement this protocol is 5-7 h, with additional time potentially necessary, depending on the complexity of the reference standard DDI database and the similarity measures implemented.",

        "Abstract": "Inappropriate medications use (IMU) is a serious issue of global concern that leads to a waste of resources and potentially harms the patients. IMU can usually be identified by extracting information about the patient's conditions and treatments, and comparing them with \"medication appropriateness criteria\". To enable automation of these criteria, we developed a formal representation for them, which we called Objective Medication Appropriateness Criteria (OMAC). OMAC represents four aspects of the criteria: trigger, rules, action and metadata. Our evaluation showed that OMAC can completely represent explicitly defined medication appropriateness criteria using links to external knowledge sources. OMAC is the first formal representation for medication appropriateness criteria, and will enable development of structured rules for appropriate use of medications that can be implemented using standards for clinical decision support.",

        "Abstract": "Developing electronic health record (EHR) phenotyping algorithms involves generating queries that run across the EHR data repository. Algorithms are commonly assessed within demonstration studies. There remains, however, little emphasis on assessing the precision and accuracy of measurement methods during the evaluation process. Depending on the complexity of an algorithm, interim refinements may be required to improve measurement methods. Therefore, we develop an evaluation framework that incorporates both measurement and demonstration studies. We evaluate a baseline EHR phenotyping algorithm for drug induced liver injury (DILI) developed in collaboration with electronic Medical Records Genomics (eMERGE) network participants. We conduct a measurement study and report qualitative (i.e., perceptions of evaluation approach effectiveness) and quantitative (i.e., inter-rater reliability) measures. We also conduct a demonstration study and report qualitative (i.e., appropriateness of results) and quantitative (i.e., positive predictive value) measures. Given results from the measurement study, our evaluation approach underwent multiple changes including the addition of laboratory value visualization and an expanded review of clinical notes. Results from the demonstration study informed changes to our algorithm. For example, given the goal of eMERGE to identify patients who may have a genetic susceptibility to DILI, we excluded overdose patients.",

        "Abstract": "Extracting comorbidity information is crucial for phenotypic studies because of the confounding effect of comorbidities. We developed an automated method that accurately determines comorbidities from electronic medical records. Using a modified version of the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), two physicians created a reference standard of comorbidities by manual review of 100 admission notes. We processed the notes using the MedLEE natural language processing system, and wrote queries to extract comorbidities automatically from its structured output. Interrater agreement for the reference set was very high (97.7%). Our method yielded an F1 score of 0.761 and the summed CCI score was not different from the reference standard (p=0.329, power 80.4%). In comparison, obtaining comorbidities from claims data yielded an F1 score of 0.741, due to lower sensitivity (66.1%). Because CCI has previously been validated as a predictor of mortality and readmission, our method could allow automated prediction of these outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) is crucial for advancing healthcare because it is needed to transform relevant information locked in text into structured data that can be used by computer processes aimed at improving patient care and advancing medicine. In light of the importance of NLP to health, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) recently sponsored a workshop to review the state of the art in NLP focusing on text in English, both in biomedicine and in the general language domain. Specific goals of the NLM-sponsored workshop were to identify the current state of the art, grand challenges and specific roadblocks, and to identify effective use and best practices. This paper reports on the main outcomes of the workshop, including an overview of the state of the art, strategies for advancing the field, and obstacles that need to be addressed, resulting in recommendations for a research agenda intended to advance the field.",

Now in its sixth year and second funding cycle, and comprising nine research groups and a coordinating center, the network has played a major role in validating the concept that clinical data derived from electronic medical records can be used successfully for genomic research. Current work is advancing knowledge in multiple disciplines at the intersection of genomics and health-care informatics, particularly for electronic phenotyping, genome-wide association studies, genomic medicine implementation, and the ethical and regulatory issues associated with genomics research and returning results to study participants. Here, we describe the evolution, accomplishments, opportunities, and challenges of the network from its inception as a five-group consortium focused on genotype-phenotype associations for genomic discovery to its current form as a nine-group consortium pivoting toward the implementation of genomic medicine.",

        "Abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) constitute an important problem in postmarketing pharmacovigilance and in the development of new drugs. The effectiveness or toxicity of a medication could be affected by the co-administration of other drugs that share pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic pathways. For this reason, a great effort is being made to develop new methodologies to detect and assess DDIs. In this article, we present a novel method based on drug interaction profile fingerprints (IPFs) with successful application to DDI detection. IPFs were generated based on the DrugBank database, which provided 9,454 well-established DDIs as a primary source of interaction data. The model uses IPFs to measure the similarity of pairs of drugs and generates new putative DDIs from the non-intersecting interactions of a pair. We described as part of our analysis the pharmacological and biological effects associated with the putative interactions; for example, the interaction between haloperidol and dicyclomine can cause increased risk of psychosis and tardive dyskinesia. First, we evaluated the method through hold-out validation and then by using four independent test sets that did not overlap with DrugBank. Precision for the test sets ranged from 0.4-0.5 with more than two fold enrichment factor enhancement. In conclusion, we demonstrated the usefulness of the method in pharmacovigilance as a DDI predictor, and created a dataset of potential DDIs, highlighting the etiology or pharmacological effect of the DDI, and providing an exploratory tool to facilitate decision support in DDI detection and patient safety.",

        "Abstract": "A series of (coumarin-3-yl)carbamates was synthesized and evaluated in\u00a0vitro as monoamine oxidase (MAO-A and MAO-B) inhibitors. Most of the new compounds selectively inhibited MAO-B isoenzyme with IC50 values in the micro or nanoMolar ranges. Since these compounds must achieve the brain cells, theoretical evaluation of ADME properties were also carried out. Compound 8 (benzyl(coumarin-3-yl)carbamate), which presented the most interesting in\u00a0vitro MAO-B inhibitory profile (IC50 against MAO-B\u00a0=\u00a045\u00a0nM), was subjected to further studies. This in\u00a0vitro MAO-B inhibitory activity is comparable with that of the selegiline, the reference compound (IC50 against MAO-B\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0nM). Taking into account the in\u00a0vitro results of compound 8, in\u00a0vivo assays and docking calculations were also carried out for this derivative.",

        "Abstract": "Abbreviations are widely used in clinical notes and are often ambiguous. Word sense disambiguation (WSD) for clinical abbreviations therefore is a critical task for many clinical natural language processing (NLP) systems. Supervised machine learning based WSD methods are known for their high performance. However, it is time consuming and costly to construct annotated samples for supervised WSD approaches and sense frequency information is often ignored by these methods. In this study, we proposed a profile-based method that used dictated discharge summaries as an external source to automatically build sense profiles and applied them to disambiguate abbreviations in hospital admission notes via the vector space model. Our evaluation using a test set containing 2,386 annotated instances from 13 ambiguous abbreviations in admission notes showed that the profile-based method performed better than two baseline methods and achieved a best average precision of 0.792. Furthermore, we developed a strategy to combine sense frequency information estimated from a clustering analysis with the profile-based method. Our results showed that the combined approach largely improved the performance and achieved a highest precision of 0.875 on the same test set, indicating that integrating sense frequency information with local context is effective for clinical abbreviation disambiguation.",

        "Title": "Predicting monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity through ligand-based models.",
        "Abstract": "The evolution of bio- and cheminformatics associated with the development of specialized software and increasing computer power has produced a great interest in theoretical in silico methods applied in drug rational design. These techniques apply the concept that \"similar molecules have similar biological properties\" that has been exploited in Medicinal Chemistry for years to design new molecules with desirable pharmacological profiles. Ligand-based methods are not dependent on receptor structural data and take into account two and three-dimensional molecular properties to assess similarity of new compounds in regards to the set of molecules with the biological property under study. Depending on the complexity of the calculation, there are different types of ligand-based methods, such as QSAR (Quantitative Structure- Activity Relationship) with 2D and 3D descriptors, CoMFA (Comparative Molecular Field Analysis) or pharmacophoric approaches. This work provides a description of a series of ligand-based models applied in the prediction of the inhibitory activity of monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes. The controlled regulation of the enzymes' function through the use of MAO inhibitors is used as a treatment in many psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. For this reason, multiple scaffolds, such as substituted coumarins, indolylmethylamine or pyridazine derivatives were synthesized and assayed toward MAO-A and MAO-B inhibition. Our intention is to focus on the description of ligand-based models to provide new insights in the relationship between the MAO inhibitory activity and the molecular structure of the different inhibitors, and further study enzyme selectivity and possible mechanisms of action.",

        "Abstract": "Abbreviations are widely used in clinical documents and they are often ambiguous. Building a list of possible senses (also called sense inventory) for each ambiguous abbreviation is the first step to automatically identify correct meanings of abbreviations in given contexts. Clustering based methods have been used to detect senses of abbreviations from a clinical corpus [1]. However, rare senses remain challenging and existing algorithms are not good enough to detect them. In this study, we developed a new two-phase clustering algorithm called Tight Clustering for Rare Senses (TCRS) and applied it to sense generation of abbreviations in clinical text. Using manually annotated sense inventories from a set of 13 ambiguous clinical abbreviations, we evaluated and compared TCRS with the existing Expectation Maximization (EM) clustering algorithm for sense generation, at two different levels of annotation cost (10 vs. 20 instances for each abbreviation). Our results showed that the TCRS-based method could detect 85% senses on average; while the EM-based method found only 75% senses, when similar annotation effort (about 20 instances) was used. Further analysis demonstrated that the improvement by the TCRS method was mainly from additionally detected rare senses, thus indicating its usefulness for building more complete sense inventories of clinical abbreviations.",

An executable standardized knowledgebase of drug-ADE relations which is publicly available would be valuable so that it could be used for ADE detection. The literature is an important source that could be used to generate a knowledgebase of drug-ADE pairs. In this paper, we report on a method that automatically determines whether a specific adverse event (AE) is caused by a specific drug based on the content of PubMed citations. A drug-ADE classification method was initially developed to detect neutropenia based on a pre-selected set of drugs. This method was then applied to a different set of 76 drugs to determine if they caused neutropenia. For further proof of concept this method was applied to 48 drugs to determine whether they caused another AE, myocardial infarction. Results showed that AUROC was 0.93 and 0.86 respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Knowledge of medication indications is significant for automatic applications aimed at improving patient safety, such as computerized physician order entry and clinical decision support systems. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) contains pertinent information related to patient safety such as information related to appropriate prescribing. However, the reasons for medication prescriptions are usually not explicitly documented in the patient record. This paper describes a method that determines the reasons for medication uses based on information occurring in outpatient notes. The method utilizes drug-indication knowledge that we acquired, and natural language processing. Evaluation showed the method obtained a sensitivity of 62.8%, specificity of 93.9%, precision of 90% and F-measure of 73.9%. This pilot study demonstrated that linking external drug indication knowledge to the EHR for determining the reasons for medication use was promising, but also revealed some challenges. Future work will focus on increasing the accuracy and coverage of the indication knowledge and evaluating its performance using a much larger set of drugs frequently used in the outpatient population.",

The increasing number of clinical record entries that have become available electronically provides access to rich, large sets of patients' longitudinal medical information. By integrating and comparing relations found in the EHRs with those already reported in the literature, we are able to verify existing and to identify rare or novel associations. Of particular interest is the identification of rare disease co-morbidities, where the small numbers of diagnosed patients make robust statistical analysis difficult. Here, we introduce ADAMS, an Application for Discovering Disease Associations using Multiple Sources, which contains various statistical and language processing operations. We apply ADAMS to the New York-Presbyterian Hospital's EHR to combine the information from the relational diagnosis tables and textual discharge summaries with those from PubMed and Wikipedia in order to investigate the co-morbidities of the rare diseases Kaposi sarcoma, toxoplasmosis, and Kawasaki disease. In addition to finding well-known characteristics of diseases, ADAMS can identify rare or previously unreported associations. In particular, we report a statistically significant association between Kawasaki disease and diagnosis of autistic disorder.",

        "Abstract": "Biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) is a useful technique that unlocks valuable information stored in textual data for practice and/or research. Syntactic parsing is a critical component of BioNLP applications that rely on correctly determining the sentence and phrase structure of free text. In addition to dealing with the vast amount of domain-specific terms, a robust biomedical parser needs to model the semantic grammar to obtain viable syntactic structures. With either a rule-based or corpus-based approach, the grammar engineering process requires substantial time and knowledge from experts, and does not always yield a semantically transferable grammar. To reduce the human effort and to promote semantic transferability, we propose an automated method for deriving a probabilistic grammar based on a training corpus consisting of concept strings and semantic classes from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a comprehensive terminology resource widely used by the community. The grammar is designed to specify noun phrases only due to the nominal nature of the majority of biomedical terminological concepts. Evaluated on manually parsed clinical notes, the derived grammar achieved a recall of 0.644, precision of 0.737, and average cross-bracketing of 0.61, which demonstrated better performance than a control grammar with the semantic information removed. Error analysis revealed shortcomings that could be addressed to improve performance. The results indicated the feasibility of an approach which automatically incorporates terminology semantics in the building of an operational grammar. Although the current performance of the unsupervised solution does not adequately replace manual engineering, we believe once the performance issues are addressed, it could serve as an aide in a semi-supervised solution.",

We have utilized the BioMedLEE NLP system to extract and encode, using standard ontologies (e.g., Cell Type Ontology, Mammalian Phenotype, Gene Ontology), biomolecular mechanisms and clinical phenotypes from the scientific literature. We subsequently applied semantic processing techniques to the structured BioMedLEE output to determine the relationships between these biomolecular and clinical phenotype concepts.

        "Abstract": "Many adverse drug effects (ADEs) can be attributed to drug interactions. Spontaneous reporting systems (SRS) provide a rich opportunity to detect novel post-marketed drug interaction adverse effects (DIAEs), as they include populations not well represented in clinical trials. However, their identification in SRS is nontrivial. Most existing research have addressed the statistical issues used to test or verify DIAEs, but not their identification as part of a systematic large scale database-wide mining process as discussed in this work. This paper examines the application of a highly optimized and tailored implementation of the Apriori algorithm, as well as methods addressing data quality issues, to the identification of DIAEs in FDAs SRS.",

Notable revisions to the 2006 recommendations include 1) revisions to the tables of contraindications and precautions to vaccination, as well as a separate table of conditions that are commonly misperceived as contraindications and precautions; 2) reordering of the report content, with vaccine risk-benefit screening, managing adverse reactions, reporting of adverse events, and the vaccine injury compensation program presented immediately after the discussion of contraindications and precautions; 3) stricter criteria for selecting an appropriate storage unit for vaccines; 4) additional guidance for maintaining the cold chain in the event of unavoidable temperature deviations; and 5) updated revisions for vaccination of patients who have received a hematopoietic cell transplant. The most recent ACIP recommendations for each specific vaccine should be consulted for comprehensive details.

        "Abstract": "Multi-item adverse drug event (ADE) associations are associations relating multiple drugs to possibly multiple adverse events. The current standard in pharmacovigilance is bivariate association analysis, where each single drug-adverse effect combination is studied separately. The importance and difficulty in the detection of multi-item ADE associations was noted in several prominent pharmacovigilance studies. In this paper we examine the application of a well established data mining method known as association rule mining, which we tailored to the above problem, and demonstrate its value. The method was applied to the FDAs spontaneous adverse event reporting system (AERS) with minimal restrictions and expectations on its output, an experiment that has not been previously done on the scale and generality proposed in this work.",

        "Abstract": "Knowledge acquisition of relations between biomedical entities is critical for many automated biomedical applications, including pharmacovigilance and decision support. Automated acquisition of statistical associations from biomedical and clinical documents has shown some promise. However, acquisition of clinically meaningful relations (i.e. specific associations) remains challenging because textual information is noisy and co-occurrence does not typically determine specific relations. In this work, we focus on acquisition of two types of relations from clinical reports: disease-manifestation related symptom (MRS) and drug-adverse drug event (ADE), and explore the use of filtering by sections of the reports to improve performance. Evaluation indicated that applying the filters improved recall (disease-MRS: from 0.85 to 0.90; drug-ADE: from 0.43 to 0.75) and precision (disease-MRS: from 0.82 to 0.92; drug-ADE: from 0.16 to 0.31). This preliminary study demonstrates that selecting information in narrative electronic reports based on the sections improves the detection of disease-MRS and drug-ADE types of relations. Further investigation of complementary methods, such as more sophisticated statistical methods, more complex temporal models and use of information from other knowledge sources, is needed.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE It is vital to detect the full safety profile of a drug throughout its market life. Current pharmacovigilance systems still have substantial limitations, however. The objective of our work is to demonstrate the feasibility of using natural language processing (NLP), the comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR), and association statistics for pharmacovigilance purposes. DESIGN Narrative discharge summaries were collected from the Clinical Information System at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH). MedLEE, an NLP system, was applied to the collection to identify medication events and entities which could be potential adverse drug events (ADEs). Co-occurrence statistics with adjusted volume tests were used to detect associations between the two types of entities, to calculate the strengths of the associations, and to determine their cutoff thresholds. Seven drugs/drug classes (ibuprofen, morphine, warfarin, bupropion, paroxetine, rosiglitazone, ACE inhibitors) with known ADEs were selected to evaluate the system. RESULTS One hundred thirty-two potential ADEs were found to be associated with the 7 drugs. Overall recall and precision were 0.75 and 0.31 for known ADEs respectively. Importantly, qualitative evaluation using historic roll back design suggested that novel ADEs could be detected using our system. CONCLUSIONS This study provides a framework for the development of active, high-throughput and prospective systems which could potentially unveil drug safety profiles throughout their entire market life. Our results demonstrate that the framework is feasible although there are some challenging issues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using comprehensive unstructured data from the EHR for pharmacovigilance.",

This a computationally-derived resource is primarily intended to provide phenotypic context (cell type, tissue, organ, and disease) for mining existing associations between gene products and GO terms specified in the Gene Ontology Databases Automated natural language processing (BioMedLEE) and computational ontology (PhenOS) methods were used to derive these relationships from the literature, expanding the database with information from ten additional species to include over 600,000 phenotypic contexts spanning eleven species from five GO annotation databases. A comprehensive evaluation evaluating the mappings (n = 300) found precision (positive predictive value) at 85%, and recall (sensitivity) at 76%. Phenotypes are encoded in general purpose ontologies such as Cell Ontology, the Unified Medical Language System, and in specialized ontologies such as the Mouse Anatomy and the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology. A web portal has also been developed, allowing for advanced filtering and querying of the database as well as download of the entire dataset http://www.phenogo.org.",

        "Abstract": "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) determines the correct meaning of a word that has more than one meaning, and is a critical step in biomedical natural language processing, as interpretation of information in text can be correct only if the meanings of their component terms are correctly identified first. Quality evaluation sets are important to WSD because they can be used as representative samples for developing automatic programs and as referees for comparing different WSD programs. To help create quality test sets for WSD, we developed a MeSH-based automatic sense-tagging method that preferentially annotates terms being topical of the text. Preliminary results were promising and revealed important issues to be addressed in biomedical WSD research. We also suggest that, by cross-validating with 2 or 3 annotators, the method should be able to efficiently generate quality WSD test sets.

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of electronic medical record (EMR) systems has made mass-screening for clinical trials viable through secondary uses of clinical data, which often exist in both structured and free text formats. The tradeoffs of using information in either data format for clinical trials screening are understudied. This paper compares the results of clinical trial eligibility queries over ICD9-encoded diagnoses and NLP-processed textual discharge summaries. The strengths and weaknesses of both data sources are summarized along the following dimensions: information completeness, expressiveness, code granularity, and accuracy of temporal information. We conclude that NLP-processed patient reports supplement important information for eligibility screening and should be used in combination with structured data.",

In this work, we develop automated methods for acquisition and discovery of medical knowledge embedded in clinical narrative reports. MedLEE, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system, is applied to extract and encode clinical entities from narrative clinical reports obtained from New York-Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH), and associations between the clinical entities are determined based on statistical methods adjusted by volume tests. We focus on two types of entities, disease and symptom, in this study. Evaluation based on a random sample of disease-symptom associations indicates an overall recall of 90% and a precision of 92%. In conclusion, the preliminary study demonstrated that this method for knowledge acquisition of disease-symptom pairs from clinical reports is effective. The automated method is generalizable, and can be applied to detect other clinical associations, such as between diseases and medications.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate concept identification is crucial to biomedical natural language processing. However,ambiguity is common during the process of mapping terms to biomedical concepts (one term can be mapped to several concepts). A cost-effective approach to disambiguation relating to training is via semantic classification of the ambiguous terms,provided that the semantic classes of the concepts are available and are all different. We propose such a semantic classification based method to disambiguate ambiguous mappings with different semantic type(s), which can be used with any program that maps terms to UMLS concepts.Classifiers for the semantic types were built using abundant features extracted from a huge corpus with terms mapped to UMLS concepts. The method achieved a precision of 0.709, with unique advantages not achievable by the other comparable methods. Our results also demonstrate a need to further investigate the complementary properties of different methods.",

        "Abstract": "Various natural language processing (NLP) systems have been developed to unlock patient information from narrative clinical notes in order to support knowledge based applications such as error detection, surveillance and decision support. In many clinical notes, abbreviations are widely used without mention of their definitions, which is very different from the use of abbreviations in the biomedical literature. Thus, it is critical, but more challenging, for NLP systems to correctly interpret abbreviations in these notes. In this paper we describe a study of a two-step model for building a clinical abbreviation database: first, abbreviations in a text corpus were detected and then a sense inventory was built for those that were found. Four detection methods were developed and evaluated. Results showed that the best detection method had a precision of 91.4% and recall of 80.3%. A simple method was used to build sense inventories from two different knowledge sources: the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and a MEDLINE abbreviation database (ADAM). Evaluation showed the inventory from the UMLS appeared to be the more appropriate of the two for defining the sense of abbreviations, but was not ideal. It covered 35% of the senses and had an ambiguity rate of 40% for those that were covered. However, annotation by domain experts appears necessary for uncovered abbreviations and to determine the correct senses.",

        "Abstract": "Semantic classification is important for biomedical terminologies and the many applications that depend on them. Previously we developed two classifiers for 8 broad clinically relevant classes to reclassify and validate UMLS concepts. We found them to be complementary, and then combined them using a manual approach. In this paper, we extended the classifiers by adding an \"other\" class to categorize concepts not belonging to any of the 8 classes. In addition, we focused on automating the method for combining the two classifiers by training a meta-classifier that performs dynamic combination to exploit the strength of each classifier. The automated method performed as well as manual combination, achieving classification accuracy of about 0.81.",

        "Abstract": "The study of protein-protein interactions is essential to define the molecular networks that contribute to maintain homeostasis of an organism's body functions. Disruptions in protein interaction networks have been shown to result in diseases in both humans and animals. Monogenic diseases disrupting biochemical pathways such as hereditary coagulopathies (e.g. hemophilia), provided a deep insight in the biochemical pathways of acquired coagulopathies of complex diseases. Indeed, a variety of complex liver diseases can lead to decreased synthesis of the same set of coagulation factors as in hemophilia. Similarly, more complex diseases such as different cancers have been shown to result from malfunctions of common proteins pathways. In order to discover, in high throughput, the molecular underpinnings of poorly characterized diseases, we present a statistical method to identify shared protein interaction network(s) between diseases. Integrating (i) a protein interaction network with (ii) disease to protein relationships derived from mining Gene Ontology annotations and the biomedical literature with natural language understanding (PhenoGO), we identified protein-protein interactions that were associated with pairs of diseases and calculated the statistical significance of the occurrence of interactions in the protein interaction knowledgebase. Significant correlations between diseases and shared protein networks were identified and evaluated in this study, demonstrating the high precision of the approach and correct non-trivial predictions, signifying the potential for discovery. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the associations between diseases are directly correlated to their underlying protein-protein interaction networks, possibly providing insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of phenotypes and biological processes disrupted in related diseases.",

It specifies biomedical concepts and their semantic categories, and therefore is valuable for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other knowledge-based systems. However, the UMLS semantic classification is not always accurate, which adversely affects performance of these systems. Therefore, it is desirable to automatically validate, or, when necessary, to semantically reclassify UMLS concepts. We applied a distributional similarity method based on syntactic dependencies and -skew divergence to classify concepts in the T033 Finding class in order to determine which ones were biologic functions or disorders. A gold standard of 100 randomly sampled concepts was created that was based on a majority annotation of three experts. Precision of 0.54 and recall of 0.654 was achieved by the top prediction; precision of 0.64 and recall of 0.769 was achieved by the top 2 predictions. Error analysis revealed problems in the current method, and provided insight into future improvements.",

The effectiveness of these systems is heavily dependent on the quality of the ontological terms and their classifications. To assist in developing and maintaining the ontologies objectively, we propose automatic approaches to classify and/or validate their semantic categories. In previous work, we developed an approach using contextual syntactic features obtained from a large domain corpus to reclassify and validate concepts of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a comprehensive resource of biomedical terminology. In this paper, we introduce another classification approach based on words of the concept strings and compare it to the contextual syntactic approach.",

The availability of a \u00e2euro tabular' format that simplifies the content and structure of NLP output may facilitate the dissemination and use by users who are more familiar with common spreadsheet, database, or statistical tools. In this paper, we describe the knowledge-based design of a tabular representation for NLP output and development of a transformation program for the structured output of MedLEE, an NLP system at our institution. Through an evaluation, we found that the simplified tabular format is comparable to existing more complex NLP formats in effectiveness for identifying clinical conditions in narrative reports.",

Cochrane Scientific Reviews are currently considered to be the \"gold standard\" for evidence-based medicine (EBM), because of their well-defined systematic approach to assessing the available medical information. In order to develop semantic approaches for enabling the reuse of these Reviews, a system for producing executable knowledge was designed using a natural language processing (NLP) system we developed (BioMedLEE), and semantic processing techniques. Though BioMedLEE was not designed for or trained over the Cochrane Reviews, this study shows that disease, therapy and drug concepts can be extracted and correlated with an overall recall of 80.3%, coding precision of 94.1%, and concept-concept relationship precision of 87.3%.",

        "Title": "PhenoGO: assigning phenotypic context to gene ontology annotations with natural language processing.",
        "Abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) is a high throughput technology because it can process vast quantities of text within a reasonable time period. It has the potential to substantially facilitate biomedical research by extracting, linking, and organizing massive amounts of information that occur in biomedical journal articles as well as in textual fields of biological databases. Until recently, much of the work in biological NLP and text mining has revolved around recognizing the occurrence of biomolecular entities in articles, and in extracting particular relationships among the entities. Now, researchers have recognized a need to link the extracted information to ontologies or knowledge bases, which is a more difficult task. One such knowledge base is Gene Ontology annotations (GOA), which significantly increases semantic computations over the function, cellular components and processes of genes. For multicellular organisms, these annotations can be refined with phenotypic context, such as the cell type, tissue, and organ because establishing phenotypic contexts in which a gene is expressed is a crucial step for understanding the development and the molecular underpinning of the pathophysiology of diseases. In this paper, we propose a system, PhenoGO, which automatically augments annotations in GOA with additional context. PhenoGO utilizes an existing NLP system, called BioMedLEE, an existing knowledge-based phenotype organizer system (PhenOS) in conjunction with MeSH indexing and established biomedical ontologies. More specifically, PhenoGO adds phenotypic contextual information to existing associations between gene products and GO terms as specified in GOA. The system also maps the context to identifiers that are associated with different biomedical ontologies, including the UMLS, Cell Ontology, Mouse Anatomy, NCBI taxonomy, GO, and Mammalian Phenotype Ontology. In addition, PhenoGO was evaluated for coding of anatomical and cellular information and assigning the coded phenotypes to the correct GOA; results obtained show that PhenoGO has a precision of 91% and recall of 92%, demonstrating that the PhenoGO NLP system can accurately encode a large number of anatomical and cellular ontologies to GO annotations. The PhenoGO Database may be accessed at the following URL: http://www.phenoGO.org",

        "Abstract": "Molecular imaging is at the crossroads of genomic sciences and medical imaging. Information within the molecular imaging literature could be used to link to genomic and imaging information resources and to organize and index images in a way that is potentially useful to researchers. A number of natural language processing (NLP) systems are available to automatically extract information from genomic literature. One existing NLP system, known as BioMedLEE, automatically extracts biological information consisting of biomolecular substances and phenotypic data. This paper focuses on the adaptation, evaluation, and application of BioMedLEE to the molecular imaging domain. In order to adapt BioMedLEE for this domain, we extend an existing molecular imaging terminology and incorporate it into BioMedLEE. BioMedLEE's performance is assessed with a formal evaluation study. The system's performance, measured as recall and precision, is 0.74 (95% CI: [.70-.76]) and 0.70 (95% CI [.63-.76]), respectively. We adapt a JAVA viewer known as PGviewer for the simultaneous visualization of images with NLP extracted information.",

        "Abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) techniques are increasingly being used in biology to automate the capture of new biological discoveries in text, which are being reported at a rapid rate. Yet, information represented in NLP data structures is classically very different from information organized with ontologies as found in model organisms or genetic databases. To facilitate the computational reuse and integration of information buried in unstructured text with that of genetic databases, we propose and evaluate a translational schema that represents a comprehensive set of phenotypic and genetic entities, as well as their closely related biomedical entities and relations as expressed in natural language. In addition, the schema connects different scales of biological information, and provides mappings from the textual information to existing ontologies, which are essential in biology for integration, organization, dissemination and knowledge management of heterogeneous phenotypic information. A common comprehensive representation for otherwise heterogeneous phenotypic and genetic datasets, such as the one proposed, is critical for advancing systems biology because it enables acquisition and reuse of unprecedented volumes of diverse types of knowledge and information from text.",

Automated techniques have been developed that address the WSD problem for a number of text processing situations, but the problem is still a challenging one. Supervised WSD machine learning (ML) methods have been applied in the biomedical domain and have shown promising results, but the results typically incorporate a number of confounding factors, and it is problematic to truly understand the effectiveness and generalizability of the methods because these factors interact with each other and affect the final results. Thus, there is a need to explicitly address the factors and to systematically quantify their effects on performance.",

We propose an architecture for an integrated approach to process temporal information in clinical narrative reports. The goal is to initiate and build a foundation that supports applications which assist healthcare practice and research by including the ability to determine the time of clinical events (e.g., past vs. present). Key components include: (1) an annotation schema for temporal expressions and the development of an associated tagger; (2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for encoding and extracting medical events and associating them with formalized temporal data; (3) a post-processor, with a knowledge-based subsystem to help discover implicit information, that resolves temporal expressions and deals with issues such as granularity and vagueness; and (4) a reasoning mechanism which models clinical reports as Simple Temporal Problems (STPs).",

The traditional manual method of developing terminology models is time-consuming and limited in the number of phrases that a human developer can examine. In this paper, we present an automated method for developing medical terminology models based on natural language processing (NLP) and information visualization techniques. Surgical pathology reports were selected as the testing corpus for developing a pathology procedure terminology model. The use of a general NLP processor for the medical domain, MedLEE, provides an automated method for acquiring semantic structures from a free text corpus and sheds light on a new high-throughput method of medical terminology model development. The use of an information visualization technique supports the summarization and visualization of the large quantity of semantic structures generated from medical documents. We believe that a general method based on NLP and information visualization will facilitate the modeling of medical terminologies.",

        "Abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) is critical for improvement of the healthcare process because it can encode clinical data in patient documents. Many clinical applications such as decision support require coded data to function appropriately. However, in order to be applicable for healthcare, performance must be adequate. A valuable automated application is the detection of infectious diseases, such as surveillance of pneumonia in newborns (e.g., neonates) because the disease produces significant rates of morbidity and mortality, and manual surveillance is challenging. Studies have demonstrated that automated surveillance using NLP is a useful adjunct to manual surveillance and an effective tool for infection control practitioners. This paper presents a study evaluating the feasibility of an NLP-based monitoring system to screen for healthcare-associated pneumonia in neonates. We estimated sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value by comparing results with clinicians' judgments. Sensitivity was 71% and specificity was 99%. Our results demonstrated that the automated method was feasible.",

        "Abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) systems have demonstrated utility in parsing narrative texts for purposes such as surveillance and decision support. However, there has been little work related to NLP of nursing narratives. The purpose of this study was to compare the semantic categories of a NLP system (Medical Language Extraction and Encoding [MedLEE] system) with the semantic domains, categories, and attributes of the International Standards Organization (ISO) reference terminology models for nursing diagnoses and nursing actions. All but two MedLEE diagnosis and procedure-related semantic categories mapped to ISO models. In some instances, we found exact correspondence between the semantic structures of MedLEE and the ISO models. In other situations (e.g. aspects of Site or Location), the ISO model was not as granular as MedLEE. For clinical procedure and non-invasive examination, two ISO nursing action model components (Action and Target) mapped to a single MedLEE semantic category. The ISO models are applicable to NLP of nursing narratives. However, the ISO models require additional specification of selected semantic categories for the abstract semantic domains in order to achieve the objective of using NLP to parse and encode data from nursing narratives. Our analysis also suggests areas for extension of MedLEE particularly in regard to represent nursing actions.",

        "Title": "Extracting phenotypic information from the literature via natural language processing.",
        "Abstract": "In recent years, the amount of biomedical knowledge has been increasing exponentially. Several Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems have been developed to help researchers extract, encode and organize new information automatically from textual literature or narrative reports. Some of these systems focus on extracting biological entities or molecular interactions while others retrieve and encode clinical information. To exploit gene functions in the post-genome era, it is necessary to extract phenotypic information automatically from the literature as well. However, few NLP projects have focused on this. We present the development of a system called BioMedLEE that extracts a broad variety of phenotypic information from the biomedical literature. The system was developed by adapting MedLEE, an existing clinical information extraction NLP engine. A feasibility evaluation study of BioMedLEE was performed using 300 randomly chosen journal titles. Results showed that experts achieved an average precision rate of 65.4%, (95%CI: [58.0%, 72.8%]) and a recall rate of 73.0%, (95%CI: [66.2%, 80.0%]). BioMedLEE had 64.0% precision and 77.1% recall respectively, according to expert agreements.",

        "Abstract": "With the evolving use of computers in healthcare, the electronic medical record (EMR) is becoming more and more popular. A tool is needed that would enable physicians to accurately and efficiently access clinical information in multiple medical records associated with a particular patient. Both natural language processing (NLP) and the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) have been used in the clinical domain for capturing, representing, and utilizing clinical information and both have shown great potential. In this paper, we demonstrate another use of XML and NLP through CliniViewer, a tool that organizes and presents the clinical information in multiple records. We also describe the flexibility and capability provided when combining XML and NLP to summarize, navigate, and conceptualize structured information. The tool has been fully implemented and tested using patients with multiple discharge summaries.",

        "Abstract": "Many ongoing clinical research projects, such as projects involving studies associated with cancer, involve manual capture of information in surgical pathology reports so that the information can be used to determine the eligibility of recruited patients for the study and to provide other information, such as cancer prognosis. Natural language processing (NLP) systems offer an alternative to automated coding, but pathology reports have certain features that are difficult for NLP systems. This paper describes how a preprocessor was integrated with an existing NLP system (MedLEE) in order to reduce modification to the NLP system and to improve performance. The work was done in conjunction with an ongoing clinical research project that assesses disparities and risks of developing breast cancer for minority women. An evaluation of the system was performed using manually coded data from the research project's database as a gold standard. The evaluation outcome showed that the extended NLP system had a sensitivity of 90.6% and a precision of 91.6%. Results indicated that this system performed satisfactorily for capturing information for the cancer research project.",

        "Abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) systems have demonstrated utility in parsing narrative texts for purposes such as surveillance and decision support. However, there has been little work related to NLP of nursing narratives. The purpose of this study was to compare the semantic categories of a NLP system (Medical Language Extraction and Encoding [MedLEE] system) with the semantic domains, categories, and attributes of the International Standards Organization(ISO) reference terminology models for nursing diagnoses and nursing actions. All but two MedLEE diagnosis and procedure-related semantic categories mapped to ISO models. In some instances, we found exact correspondence between the semantic structures of MedLEE and the ISO models. In other situations (e.g. aspects of site or location), the ISO model was not as granular as MedLEE. For clinical procedure and non-invasive examination, two ISO nursing action model components (action and target) were required to represent the MedLEE semantic category. The ISO model requires additional specification of selected semantic categories for the abstract semantic domains in order to achieve the objective of using NLP to parse and encode data from nursing narratives. Our analysis also suggests areas for extension of MedLEE.",

        "Abstract": "With more and more scientific literature published online, the effective management and reuse of this knowledge has become problematic. Natural language processing (NLP) may be a potential solution by extracting, structuring and organizing biomedical information in online literature in a timely manner. One essential task is to recognize and identify genomic entities in text. 'Recognition' can be accomplished using pattern matching and machine learning. But for 'identification' these techniques are not adequate. In order to identify genomic entities, NLP needs a comprehensive resource that specifies and classifies genomic entities as they occur in text and that associates them with normalized terms and also unique identifiers so that the extracted entities are well defined. Online organism databases are an excellent resource to create such a lexical resource. However, gene name ambiguity is a serious problem because it affects the appropriate identification of gene entities. In this paper, we explore the extent of the problem and suggest ways to address it.",

        "Abstract": "Information on molecular networks, such as networks of interacting proteins, comes from diverse sources that contain remarkable differences in distribution and quantity of errors. Here, we introduce a probabilistic model useful for predicting protein interactions from heterogeneous data sources. The model describes stochastic generation of protein-protein interaction networks with real-world properties, as well as generation of two heterogeneous sources of protein-interaction information: research results automatically extracted from the literature and yeast two-hybrid experiments. Based on the domain composition of proteins, we use the model to predict protein interactions for pairs of proteins for which no experimental data are available. We further explore the prediction limits, given experimental data that cover only part of the underlying protein networks. This approach can be extended naturally to include other types of biological data sources.",

Concurrently, the value of narrative as the clinician's rich description of the encounter and source of vital information has been reaffirmed. Natural language processing (NLP) offers a strategy for integrating these approaches to provide structured reports for further computer processing. As part of a larger project aimed at using narrative data to enrich the online medical record, we analyzed a small sample of documents in a corpus of progress notes to identify potential challenges associated with using NLP for HIV/AIDS clinic notes. We provide illustrative examples of five types of challenges.",

One such measure is the use of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). DALYs were calculated for the General Motors (GM) population for 1994 through 1998 using data from GM's Mortality Registry, published life tables, and age- and sex-specific disease incidence and disability data from the U.S. Burden of Disease Study. Chronic diseases accounted for 45% (245,844 of 540,450) of total DALYs lost. Ischemic heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease led the list for both men and women and accounted for 39% and 31%, respectively, of the top 10 DALYs lost. Disease burden among employees could be reduced through targeted interventions aimed at the risk factors associated with the leading causes of DALYs.",

        "Abstract": "Medical terminologies are critical for automated healthcare systems. Some terminologies, such as the UMLS and SNOMED are comprehensive, whereas others specialize in limited domains (i.e., BIRADS) or are developed for specific applications. An important feature of a terminology is comprehensive coverage of relevant clinical terms and ease of use by users, which include computerized applications. We have developed a method for facilitating vocabulary development and maintenance that is based on utilization of natural language processing to mine large collections of clinical reports in order to obtain information on terminology as expressed by physicians. Once the reports are processed and the terms structured and collected into an XML representational schema, it is possible to determine information about terms, such as frequency of occurrence, compositionality, relations to other terms (such as modifiers), and correspondence to a controlled vocabulary. This paper describes the method and discusses how it can be used as a tool to help vocabulary builders navigate through the terms physicians use, visualize their relations to other terms via a flexible viewer, and determine their correspondence to a controlled vocabulary.",

        "Abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) systems have been developed to provide access to the tremendous body of data and knowledge that is available in the biomedical domain in the form of natural language text. These NLP systems are valuable because they can encode and amass the information in the text so that it can be used by other automated processes to improve patient care and our understanding of disease processes and treatments. Zellig Harris proposed a theory of sublanguage that laid the foundation for natural language processing in specialized domains. He hypothesized that the informational content and structure form a specialized language that can be delineated in the form of a sublanguage grammar. The grammar can then be used by a language processor to capture and encode the salient information and relations in text. In this paper, we briefly summarize his language and sublanguage theories. In addition, we summarize our prior research, which is associated with the sublanguage grammars we developed for two different biomedical domains. These grammars illustrate how Harris' theories provide a basis for the development of language processing systems in the biomedical domain. The two domains and their associated sublanguages discussed are: the clinical domain, where the text consists of patient reports, and the biomolecular domain, where the text consists of complete journal articles.",

        "Abstract": "Terminological knowledge of the biomedical domain is important for natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) applications, and a number of terminological knowledge sources, such as LocusLink, GeneBank, and the UMLS, already exist. However, because of the tremendous amount of research activity in the field, new terms and symbols are continually being created, many of which are published in the literature, but are not available in any of the other resources. Therefore, effective mining of the literature for new terminology is critical for furthering NLP and IR applications. Abbreviations are widely used in the biomedical domain, and the understanding of abbreviations requires a terminological knowledge base that consists of abbreviations with their associated senses. In previous work, several methods have been developed for automatic construction of abbreviation knowledge bases from parenthetical expressions. However, these methods pair abbreviations and their expansions based on manually crafted patterns or rules. In this paper, we propose an automatic method, which is not based on patterns or rules but is based on the use of collocations, to extract a set of related terms from parenthetical expressions including abbreviations associated with their expansions and other types of related terms such as synonyms, or hyponyms etc. Our method is based on the observation that terms associated with parenthetical expressions i) are usually related, and ii) are often collocations because they tend to co-occur more often than expected by chance. Our method was applied to the collection of MEDLINE abstracts. The method and the results were evaluated using two collections: Berman's handcrafted abbreviation list and the LocusLink collection.",

        "Abstract": "Genes and proteins are often associated with multiple names, and more names are added as new functional or structural information is discovered. Because authors often alternate between these synonyms, information retrieval and extraction benefits from identifying these synonymous names. We have developed a method to extract automatically synonymous gene and protein names from MEDLINE and journal articles. We first identified patterns authors use to list synonymous gene and protein names. We developed SGPE (for synonym extraction of gene and protein names), a software program that recognizes the patterns and extracts from MEDLINE abstracts and full-text journal articles candidate synonymous terms. SGPE then applies a sequence of filters that automatically screen out those terms that are not gene and protein names. We evaluated our method to have an overall precision of 71% on both MEDLINE and journal articles, and 90% precision on the more suitable full-text articles alone",

        "Abstract": "Abbreviations are widely used in writing, and the understanding of abbreviations is important for natural language processing applications. Abbreviations are not always defined in a document and they are highly ambiguous. A knowledge base that consists of abbreviations with their associated senses and a method to resolve the ambiguities are needed. In this paper, we studied the UMLS coverage, textual variants of senses, and the ambiguity of abbreviations in MEDLINE abstracts. We restricted our study to three-letter abbreviations which were defined using parenthetical expressions. When grouping similar expansions together and representing senses using groups, we found that after ignoring senses where the total number of occurrences within the corresponding group was less than 100, 82.8% of the senses matched the UMLS, covered over 93% of occurrences that were considered, and had an average of 7.74 expansions for each sense. Abbreviations are highly ambiguous: 81.2% of the abbreviations were ambiguous, and had an average of 16.6 senses. However, after ignoring senses with occurrences of less than 5, 64.6% of the abbreviations were ambiguous, and had an average of 4.91 senses.",

        "Abstract": "XML has been widely adopted as an important data interchange language. The structure of XML enables sharing of data elements with variable degrees of nesting as long as the elements are grouped in a strict tree-like fashion. This requirement potentially restricts the usefulness of XML for marking up written text, which often includes features that do not properly nest within other features. We encountered this problem while marking up medical text with structured semantic information from a Natural Language Processor. Traditional approaches to this problem separate the structured information from the actual text mark up. This paper introduces an alternative solution, which tightly integrates the semantic structure with the text. The resulting XML markup preserves the linearity of the medical texts and can therefore be easily expanded with additional types of information.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to develop a medical language processing (MLP) system, which consisted of MedLEE and a set of inference rules, to identify 19 Charlson comorbidities from discharge summaries and chest x-ray reports. We used 233 cases to learn the patterns that were indicative of comorbidities for developing the inference rules. We then used an independent data set of 3,662 pneumonia patients to identify comorbidities by MLP compared with administrative data (ICD-9 codes). A stratified random sample of 190 records from disagreement cases was manually reviewed. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the MLP system/ICD-9 codes in this testing set were 0.84/0.16, 0.70/0.30, and 0.77/0.23 respectively. Thirteen of the 19 comorbidities studied were underreported in the administrative data. The kappa values ranged from 0.19 for peptic ulcer to 0.70 for lymphoma. We conclude that comorbidities derived from natural language processing of medical records can improve ICD-9-based approaches.",

The mapping of free-text to UMLS concepts is important for these applications. To improve the mapping, we need a method to disambiguate terms that possess multiple UMLS concepts. In the general English domain, machine-learning techniques have been applied to sense-tagged corpora, in which senses (or concepts) of ambiguous terms have been annotated (mostly manually). Sense disambiguation classifiers are then derived to determine senses (or concepts) of those ambiguous terms automatically. However, manual annotation of a corpus is an expensive task. We propose an automatic method that constructs sense-tagged corpora for ambiguous terms in the UMLS using MEDLINE abstracts.",

        "Abstract": "Knowledge on interactions between molecules in living cells is indispensable for theoretical analysis and practical applications in modern genomics and molecular biology. Building such networks relies on the assumption that the correct molecular interactions are known or can be identified by reading a few research articles. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold, as truth is rather an emerging property based on many potentially conflicting facts. This paper explores the processes of knowledge generation and publishing in the molecular biology literature using modelling and analysis of real molecular interaction data. The data analysed in this article were automatically extracted from 50000 research articles in molecular biology using a computer system called GeneWays containing a natural language processing module. The paper indicates that truthfulness of statements is associated in the minds of scientists with the relative importance (connectedness) of substances under study, revealing a potential selection bias in the reporting of research results. Aiming at understanding the statistical properties of the life cycle of biological facts reported in research articles, we formulate a stochastic model describing generation and propagation of knowledge about molecular interactions through scientific publications. We hope that in the future such a model can be useful for automatically producing consensus views of molecular interaction data.",
