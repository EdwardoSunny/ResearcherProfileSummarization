        "Abstract": "Many physiological osteocalcin-regulated functions are affected in adult offspring of mothers experiencing unhealthy pregnancy. Furthermore, osteocalcin signaling during gestation influences cognition and adrenal steroidogenesis in adult mice. Together these observations suggest that osteocalcin may broadly function during pregnancy to determine organismal homeostasis in adult mammals. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed in unchallenged wildtype and Osteocalcin-deficient, newborn and adult mice of various genotypes and origin maintained on different genetic backgrounds, the functions of osteocalcin in the pancreas, liver and testes and their molecular underpinnings. This analysis revealed that providing mothers are Osteocalcin-deficient, Osteocalcin haploinsufficiency in embryos hampers insulin secretion, liver gluconeogenesis, glucose homeostasis, testes steroidogenesis in adult offspring; inhibits cell proliferation in developing pancreatic islets and testes; and disrupts distinct programs of gene expression in these organs and in the brain. This study indicates that osteocalcin exerts dominant functions in most organs it influences. Furthermore, through their synergistic regulation of multiple physiological functions, osteocalcin of maternal and embryonic origins contributes to the establishment and maintenance of organismal homeostasis in newborn and adult offspring.",

        "Abstract": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase N2 (PTPN2) is a type 1 diabetes (T1D) candidate gene identified from human genome-wide association studies. PTPN2 is highly expressed in human and murine islets and becomes elevated upon inflammation and models of T1D, suggesting that PTPN2 may be important for \u03b2-cell survival in the context of T1D. To test whether PTPN2 contributed to \u03b2-cell dysfunction in an inflammatory environment, we generated a \u03b2-cell-specific deletion of Ptpn2 in mice (PTPN2-\u03b2 knockout [\u03b2KO]). Whereas unstressed animals exhibited normal metabolic profiles, low- and high-dose streptozotocin-treated PTPN2-\u03b2KO mice displayed hyperglycemia and accelerated death, respectively. Furthermore, cytokine-treated Ptpn2-KO islets resulted in impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, mitochondrial defects, and reduced glucose-induced metabolic flux, suggesting \u03b2-cells lacking Ptpn2 are more susceptible to inflammatory stress associated with T1D due to maladaptive metabolic fitness. Consistent with the phenotype, proteomic analysis identified an important metabolic enzyme, ATP-citrate lyase, as a novel PTPN2 substrate.",

Following its binding to one of three receptors, osteocalcin exerts a profound influence on various aspects of energy metabolism as well as steroidogenesis, neurotransmitter biosynthesis and thereby male fertility, electrolyte homeostasis, cognition, the acute stress response, and exercise capacity. Although this review focuses mostly on the regulation of energy metabolism by osteocalcin, it also touches on its other functions. Lastly, it proposes what could be a common theme between the functions of osteocalcin and between these functions and the structural functions of bone.",

Given its recently demonstrated role as a mediator of the bone to muscle to bone crosstalk during exercise, we hypothesized that interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling in bone may contribute to the beneficial effect that exercise has on bone homeostasis. In this study, we first show that aerobic exercise increases the expression of Il6r in bones of WT mice.

        "Abstract": "Genetics in model organisms has progressively broken down walls that previously separated different disciplines of biology. One example of this holistic evolution is the recognition of the complex relationship that exists between the control of bone mass (bone remodeling) and energy metabolism in mammals. Numerous hormones orchestrate this crosstalk. In particular, the study of the leptin-mediated regulation of bone mass has not only revealed the existence of a central control of bone mass but has also led to the realization that sympathetic innervation is a major regulator of bone remodeling. This happened at a time when the use of drugs aiming at treating osteoporosis, the most frequent bone disease, has dwindled. This review will highlight the main aspects of the leptin-mediated regulation of bone mass and how this led to the realization that \u03b2-blockers, which block the effects of the sympathetic nervous system, may be a viable option to prevent osteoporosis.",

In our search to identify redox-sensitive targets that contribute to redox signaling, we found that protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was reversibly oxidized and inactivated in hearts undergoing hypertrophy. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of PTP1B in mice (PTP1B cKO mice) caused a hypertrophic phenotype that was exacerbated by pressure overload. Furthermore, we showed that argonaute 2 (AGO2), a key component of the RNA-induced silencing complex, was a substrate of PTP1B in cardiomyocytes and in the heart.

Exploring this issue has been an extraordinarily powerful way to improve our knowledge of bone development and physiology. More recently, a second question has emerged: does bone have other functions besides making bone? Addressing this conundrum revealed that the bone-derived hormone osteocalcin affects a surprisingly large number of organs and physiological processes, including acute stress response. This review will focus on this emerging aspect of bone biology taking osteocalcin as a case study and will show how classical and endocrine functions of bone help to define a new functional identity for this tissue.",

        "Abstract": "Through their ability to regulate gene expression in most organs, glucocorticoid (GC) hormones influence numerous physiological processes and are therefore key regulators of organismal homeostasis. In bone, GC hormones inhibit expression of the hormone Osteocalcin for poorly understood reasons. Here, we show that in a classical endocrine feedback loop, osteocalcin in return enhanced the biosynthesis of GC as well as mineralocorticoid hormones (adrenal steroidogenesis) in rodents and primates. Conversely, inactivation of osteocalcin signaling in adrenal glands significantly impaired adrenal growth and steroidogenesis in mice. Embryo-made osteocalcin was necessary for normal Sf1 expression in fetal adrenal cells and adrenal cell steroidogenic differentiation and therefore determined the number of steroidogenic cells present in the adrenal glands of adult animals. Embryonic, not postnatal, osteocalcin also governed adrenal growth, adrenal steroidogenesis, blood pressure, electrolyte equilibrium, and the rise in circulating corticosterone levels during the acute stress response in adult offspring. This osteocalcin-dependent regulation of adrenal development and steroidogenesis occurred even in the absence of a functional hypothalamus/pituitary/adrenal axis and explains why osteocalcin administration during pregnancy promoted adrenal growth and steroidogenesis and improved the survival of adrenocorticotropic hormone signaling-deficient animals. This study reveals that a bone-derived embryonic hormone influences lifelong adrenal functions and organismal homeostasis in the mouse.",

        "Abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) plays an important role in protein metabolism and cell growth. We here show that mice (M-PDK1KO mice) with skeletal muscle-specific deficiency of 3'-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), a key component of PI3K signaling pathway, manifest a reduced skeletal muscle mass under the static condition as well as impairment of mechanical load-induced muscle hypertrophy. Whereas mechanical load-induced changes in gene expression were not affected, the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and S6 induced by mechanical load was attenuated in skeletal muscle of M-PDK1KO mice, suggesting that PDK1 regulates muscle hypertrophy not through changes in gene expression but through stimulation of kinase cascades such as the S6K-S6 axis, which plays a key role in protein synthesis.

        "Abstract": "Supraphysiological levels of the osteoblast-enriched mineralization regulator ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase or phosphodiesterase-1 (NPP1) is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We determined the impact of osteoblast-specific Enpp1 ablation on skeletal structure and metabolic phenotype in mice. Female, but not male, 6-week-old mice lacking osteoblast NPP1 expression (osteoblast-specific knockout [KO]) exhibited increased femoral bone volume or total volume (17.50% vs. 11.67%; p\u2009<\u2009.01), and reduced trabecular spacing (0.187 vs. 0.157\u2009mm; p\u2009<\u2009.01) compared with floxed (control) mice. Furthermore, an enhanced ability of isolated osteoblasts from the osteoblast-specific KO to calcify their matrix in vitro compared to fl/fl osteoblasts was observed (p\u2009<\u2009.05). Male osteoblast-specific KO and fl/fl mice showed comparable glucose and insulin tolerance despite increased levels of insulin-sensitizing under-carboxylated osteocalcin (195% increase; p\u2009<\u2009.05). However, following high-fat-diet challenge, osteoblast-specific KO mice showed impaired glucose and insulin tolerance compared with fl/fl mice. These data highlight a crucial local role for osteoblast NPP1 in skeletal development and a secondary metabolic impact that predominantly maintains insulin sensitivity.",

However, cell-specific gene deletions in the mouse and human genetic studies have identified the skeleton as a key endocrine regulator of metabolism. The bone-specific phosphatase, Phosphatase, Orphan 1 (PHOSPHO1), which is indispensable for bone mineralisation, has been recently implicated in the regulation of energy metabolism in humans, but its role in systemic metabolism remains unclear.

        "Abstract": "The alternation of resorption of preexisting bone by the osteoclasts followed by de novo bone formation by osteoblasts is called bone modeling during childhood and bone remodeling during adulthood. A central question raised by this physiological process that is fundamental to longitudinal growth during childhood and adolescence and that is attacked at the other end of life in the context of osteoporosis is to know how it is regulated. This question was rejuvenated in the late 1990s and early 2000s years when the application of mouse genetics made it feasible to test whether there were new endocrine determinants of bone (re)modeling. Addressing this question, taking into account fundamental cell biology features of bone led to the hypothesis that there should be a coordinated control of bone growth/mass, energy metabolism, and reproduction. Testing genetically and molecularly, this hypothesis revealed that, in vivo, the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin is a powerful inhibitor of bone mass accrual following its signaling in the brain. This chapter details the molecular bases and biological relevance of this regulation of bone mass accrual by leptin.",

        "Abstract": "Given the numerous health benefits of exercise, understanding how exercise capacity is regulated is a question of paramount importance. Circulating interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels surge during exercise and IL-6 favors exercise capacity. However, neither the cellular origin of circulating IL-6 during exercise nor the means by which this cytokine enhances exercise capacity has been formally established yet. Here we show through genetic means that the majority of circulating IL-6 detectable during exercise originates from muscle and that to increase exercise capacity, IL-6 must signal in osteoblasts to favor osteoclast differentiation and the release of bioactive osteocalcin in the general circulation. This explains why mice lacking the IL-6 receptor only in osteoblasts exhibit a deficit in exercise capacity of similar severity to the one seen in mice lacking muscle-derived IL-6 (mIL-6), and why this deficit is correctable by osteocalcin but not by IL-6. Furthermore, in agreement with the notion that IL-6 acts through osteocalcin, we demonstrate that mIL-6 promotes nutrient uptake and catabolism into myofibers during exercise in an osteocalcin-dependent manner. Finally, we show that the crosstalk between osteocalcin and IL-6 is conserved between rodents and humans. This study provides evidence that a muscle-bone-muscle endocrine axis is necessary to increase muscle function during exercise in rodents and humans.",

        "Abstract": "Osteocalcin (OCN) is a bone-derived hormone involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. In serum, OCN exists in carboxylated and uncarboxylated forms (ucOCN), and studies in rodents suggest that ucOCN is the bioactive form of this hormone. Whether this is also the case in humans is unclear, because a reliable assay to measure ucOCN is not available. Here, we established and validated a new immunoassay (ELISA) measuring human ucOCN and used it to determine the level of bioactive OCN in two cohorts of overweight or obese subjects, with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D). The ELISA could specifically detect ucOCN concentrations ranging from 0.037 to 1.8 ng/mL. In a first cohort of overweight or obese postmenopausal women without diabetes (",

The bone-specific protein osteocalcin (OCN) is an established marker of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) osteochondrogenic transdifferentiation and a known regulator of glucose metabolism. However, the role of OCN in controlling arterial calcification is unclear. We hypothesized that OCN regulates calcification in VSMCs and sought to identify the underpinning signaling pathways. Immunohistochemistry revealed OCN co-localization with VSMC calcification in human calcified carotid artery plaques. Additionally, 3\u2009mM phosphate treatment stimulated OCN mRNA expression in cultured VSMCs (1.72-fold, p <\u20090.001). Phosphate-induced calcification was blunted in VSMCs derived from OCN null mice (Ocn ",

        "Abstract": "We hypothesized that bone evolved, in part, to enhance the ability of bony vertebrates to escape danger in the wild. In support of this notion, we show here that a bone-derived signal is necessary to develop an acute stress response (ASR). Indeed, exposure to various types of stressors in mice, rats (rodents), and humans leads to a rapid and selective surge of circulating bioactive osteocalcin because stressors favor the uptake by osteoblasts of glutamate, which prevents inactivation of osteocalcin prior to its secretion. Osteocalcin permits manifestations of the ASR to unfold by signaling in post-synaptic parasympathetic neurons to inhibit their activity, thereby leaving the sympathetic tone unopposed. Like wild-type animals, adrenalectomized rodents and adrenal-insufficient patients can develop an ASR, and genetic studies suggest that this is due to their high circulating osteocalcin levels. We propose that osteocalcin defines a bony-vertebrate-specific endocrine mediation of the ASR.",

Although recent studies suggest the neuroprotective effects of oligodendrocytes in neurodegenerative diseases, it remains unknown whether oligodendrocyte death induced by inflammatory attacks contributes to neurodegeneration in MS and EAE. Upon endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, activation of pancreatic ER kinase (PERK) promotes cell survival through induction of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) by phosphorylating eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1). We have generated a mouse model that allows for temporally controlled activation of PERK specifically in oligodendrocytes. Our previous study has demonstrated that PERK activation specifically in oligodendrocytes attenuates EAE disease severity and ameliorates EAE-induced oligodendrocyte apoptosis, demyelination, and axon degeneration, without altering inflammation.",

Although neurodegeneration is the major contributor to chronic disability in MS, mechanisms governing the viability of axons and neurons in MS and EAE remain elusive. Data indicate that activation of pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) influences, positively or negatively, neuron and axon viability in various neurodegenerative diseases through induction of ATF4. In this study, we demonstrate that the PERK pathway was activated in neurons during EAE. We found that neuron-specific PERK inactivation impaired EAE resolution and exacerbated EAE-induced axon degeneration, neuron loss, and demyelination. Surprisingly, neuron-specific ATF4 inactivation did not alter EAE disease course or EAE-induced axon degeneration, neuron loss, and demyelination. These results suggest that PERK activation in neurons protects axons and neurons against inflammation in MS and EAE through ATF4-independent mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing in worldwide prevalence, closely tracking the obesity epidemic, but specific pharmaceutical treatments for NAFLD are lacking. Defining the key molecular pathways underlying the pathogenesis of NAFLD is essential for developing new drugs. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of gut-derived serotonin synthesis ameliorates hepatic steatosis through a reduction in liver serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A) signaling. Local serotonin concentrations in the portal blood, which can directly travel to and affect the liver, are selectively increased by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding in mice. Both gut-specific Tph1 knockout mice and liver-specific Htr2a knockout mice are resistant to HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, without affecting systemic energy homeostasis. Moreover, selective HTR2A antagonist treatment prevents HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. Thus, the gut TPH1-liver HTR2A axis shows promise as a drug target to ameliorate NAFLD with minimal systemic metabolic effects.",

        "Abstract": "Epithelial-neuronal signaling is essential for sensory encoding in touch, itch, and nociception; however, little is known about the release mechanisms and neurotransmitter receptors through which skin cells govern neuronal excitability. Merkel cells are mechanosensory epidermal cells that have long been proposed to activate neuronal afferents through chemical synaptic transmission. We employed a set of classical criteria for chemical neurotransmission as a framework to test this hypothesis. RNA sequencing of adult mouse Merkel cells demonstrated that they express presynaptic molecules and biosynthetic machinery for adrenergic transmission. Moreover, live-cell imaging directly demonstrated that Merkel cells mediate activity- and VMAT-dependent release of fluorescent catecholamine neurotransmitter analogs. Touch-evoked firing in Merkel-cell afferents was inhibited either by pre-synaptic silencing of SNARE-mediated vesicle release from Merkel cells or by neuronal deletion of \u03b2",

        "Abstract": "A remarkable, unexpected aspect of the bone-derived hormone osteocalcin is that it is necessary for both brain development and brain function in the mouse, as its absence results in a profound deficit in spatial learning and memory and an exacerbation of anxiety-like behaviour. The regulation of cognitive function by osteocalcin, together with the fact that its circulating levels decrease in midlife compared with adolescence in all species tested, raised the prospect that osteocalcin might be an anti-geronic hormone that could prevent age-related cognitive decline. As presented in this Review, recent data indicate that this is indeed the case and that osteocalcin is necessary for the anti-geronic activity recently ascribed to the plasma of young wild-type mice. The diversity and amplitude of the functions of osteocalcin in the brain, during development and postnatally, had long called for the identification of its receptor in the brain, which was also recently achieved. This Review presents our current understanding of the biology of osteocalcin in the brain, highlighting the bony vertebrate specificity of the regulation of cognitive function and pointing toward where therapeutic opportunities might exist.",

        "Abstract": "A genetics approach has uncovered that bone has more functions than expected. In particular, bone is an endocrine organ that secretes a growing number of hormones. In that context, the discovery of the osteoblast-derived hormone osteocalcin has significantly broadened the field of bone biology because of the number of physiologic processes regulated by this hormone. At present, osteocalcin has been shown to enhance several aspects of energy metabolism, brain development, and cognition. These discoveries shed light on the cross-talk between multiple organs and provide credence to the search for additional endocrine functions of bone.",

        "Abstract": "PTP1B and TC-PTP are highly related protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that regulate the JAK/STAT signaling cascade essential for cytokine-receptor activation in immune cells. Here, we describe a novel immunotherapy approach whereby monocyte-derived dendritic cell (moDC) function is enhanced by modulating the enzymatic activities of PTP1B and TC-PTP. To downregulate or delete the activity/expression of these PTPs, we generated mice with PTP-specific deletions in the dendritic cell compartment or used PTP1B and TC-PTP specific inhibitor. While total ablation of PTP1B or TC-PTP expression leads to tolerogenic DCs via STAT3 hyperactivation, downregulation of either phosphatase remarkably shifts the balance toward an immunogenic DC phenotype due to hyperactivation of STAT4, STAT1 and Src kinase. The resulting increase in IL-12 and IFN\u03b3 production subsequently amplifies the IL-12/STAT4/IFN\u03b3/STAT1/IL-12 positive autocrine loop and enhances the therapeutic potential of mature moDCs in tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of both PTPs improves the maturation of defective moDCs derived from pancreatic cancer (PaC) patients. Our study provides a new advance in the use of DC-based cancer immunotherapy that is complementary to current cancer therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an autosomal dominant human disorder characterized by abnormal bone development that is mainly due to defective intramembranous bone formation by osteoblasts. Here, we describe a mouse strain lacking the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF146 that shows phenotypic similarities to CCD. Loss of RNF146 stabilized its substrate AXIN1, leading to impairment of WNT3a-induced \u03b2-catenin activation and reduced Fgf18 expression in osteoblasts. We show that FGF18 induces transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) expression, which is required for osteoblast proliferation and differentiation through transcriptional enhancer associate domain (TEAD) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) transcription factors, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that adipogenesis is enhanced in Rnf146-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Moreover, mice with loss of RNF146 within the osteoblast lineage had increased fat stores and were glucose intolerant with severe osteopenia because of defective osteoblastogenesis and subsequent impaired osteocalcin production. These findings indicate that RNF146 is required to coordinate \u03b2-catenin signaling within the osteoblast lineage during embryonic and postnatal bone development.",

        "Abstract": "Exercise is an evolutionary conserved survival function that nowadays has beneficial health effects. The increased metabolic activity of contracting skeletal muscle affects the biology of many organs involved in regulating muscle functions. The discovery of hormones and cytokines secreted by bone and skeletal muscle during exercise, has recently added experimental credence to the notion that a crosstalk exists between these organs. Bone through the hormone osteocalcin, promotes exercise capacity in the mouse. After binding to a G-coupled protein receptor, Gprc6a, osteocalcin increases nutrients uptake and catabolism in myofibers during exercise. The catabolic aspect of osteocalcin distinguishes it from insulin signaling. In addition, osteocalcin regulates the endocrine function of skeletal muscle because it enhances the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6 is produced and secreted by contracting skeletal muscle and exerts autocrine, paracrine and systemic effects. One of the systemic functions of IL-6 is to drive the generation of bioactive osteocalcin. Altogether, these studies have revealed a feed-forward loop between bone and skeletal muscle that are necessary and sufficient for optimum exercise capacity. This endocrine regulation of exercise biology, suggest novel and adapted strategies for the prevention or treatment of age related muscle loss.",

        "Abstract": "Circulating levels of undercarboxylated and bioactive osteocalcin double during aerobic exercise at the time levels of insulin decrease. In contrast, circulating levels of osteocalcin plummet early during adulthood in mice, monkeys, and humans of both genders. Exploring these observations revealed that osteocalcin signaling in myofibers is necessary for adaptation to exercise by favoring uptake and catabolism of glucose and fatty acids, the main nutrients of myofibers. Osteocalcin signaling in myofibers also accounts for most of the exercise-induced release of interleukin-6, a myokine that promotes adaptation to exercise in part by driving the generation of bioactive osteocalcin. We further show that\u00a0exogenous osteocalcin is sufficient to enhance the exercise capacity of young mice and to restore to 15-month-old mice the exercise capacity of 3-month-old mice. This study uncovers a bone-to-muscle feedforward endocrine axis that favors adaptation to exercise and can reverse the age-induced decline in exercise capacity.",

        "Abstract": "High-fat diet (HFD) feeding induces rapid reprogramming of systemic metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that HFD feeding of mice downregulates glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 expression in blood-brain barrier (BBB) vascular endothelial cells (BECs) and reduces brain glucose uptake. Upon prolonged HFD feeding, GLUT1 expression is restored, which is paralleled by increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in macrophages at the BBB. In turn, inducible reduction of GLUT1 expression specifically in BECs reduces brain glucose uptake and increases VEGF serum concentrations in lean mice. Conversely, myeloid-cell-specific deletion of VEGF in VEGF(\u0394myel) mice impairs BBB-GLUT1 expression, brain glucose uptake, and memory formation in obese, but not in\u00a0lean mice. Moreover, obese VEGF(\u0394myel) mice exhibit exaggerated progression of cognitive decline and neuroinflammation on an Alzheimer's disease background. These experiments reveal that transient, HFD-elicited reduction of brain glucose uptake initiates a compensatory increase of VEGF production and assign obesity-associated\u00a0macrophage activation a homeostatic role to\u00a0restore cerebral glucose metabolism, preserve cognitive function, and limit neurodegeneration in obesity.",

        "Abstract": "The E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 targets the master regulator of osteoblast differentiation, Runx2, for degradation, yet the function of Smurf1, if any, during osteoblast differentiation in vivo is ill defined. Here, we show that Smurf1 prevents osteoblast differentiation by decreasing Runx2 accumulation in osteoblasts. Remarkably, mice harboring a substitution mutation at serine 148 (S148) in Smurf1 that prevents its phosphorylation by AMPK (Smurf1(ki/ki)) display a premature osteoblast differentiation phenotype that is equally severe as that of Smurf1(-/-) mice, as well as a high bone mass, and are also hyperinsulinemic and hypoglycemic. Consistent with the fact that Smurf1 targets the insulin receptor for degradation, there is, in Smurf1(ki/ki) mice, an increase in insulin signaling in osteoblasts that triggers a rise in the circulating levels of osteocalcin, a hormone that favors insulin secretion. These results identify Smurf1 as a determinant of osteoblast differentiation during the development of bone formation and glucose homeostasis post-natally and demonstrate the necessity of S148 for these functions.",

Although some evidence indicated the involvement of JMJD3 in osteoblast differentiation in vitro, its role as a whole in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in vivo remains unknown. Here we showed that homozygous deletion of Jmjd3 resulted in severe delay of osteoblast differentiation and bone ossification in mice. By biochemical and genetical methods, we demonstrated that JMJD3 mediated RUNX2 transcriptional activity and cooperated with RUNX2 to promote osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in vivo.

        "Abstract": "The synthesis of type I collagen, the main component of bone matrix, precedes the expression of Runx2, the earliest determinant of osteoblast differentiation. We hypothesized that the energetic needs of osteoblasts might explain this apparent paradox. We show here that glucose, the main nutrient of osteoblasts, is transported in these cells through Glut1, whose expression precedes that of Runx2. Glucose uptake favors osteoblast differentiation by suppressing the AMPK-dependent proteasomal degradation of Runx2 and promotes bone formation by inhibiting another function of AMPK. While RUNX2 cannot induce osteoblast differentiation when glucose uptake is compromised, raising blood glucose levels restores collagen synthesis in Runx2-null osteoblasts and initiates bone formation in Runx2-deficient embryos. Moreover, RUNX2 favors Glut1 expression, and this feedforward regulation between RUNX2 and Glut1 determines the onset of osteoblast differentiation during development and the extent of bone formation throughout life. These results reveal an unexpected intricacy between bone and glucose metabolism.",

        "Title": "DLK1 Regulates Whole-Body Glucose Metabolism: A Negative Feedback Regulation of the Osteocalcin-Insulin Loop.",
        "Abstract": "The endocrine role of the skeleton in regulating energy metabolism is supported by a feed-forward loop between circulating osteoblast (OB)-derived undercarboxylated osteocalcin (Glu-OCN) and pancreatic \u03b2-cell insulin; in turn, insulin favors osteocalcin (OCN) bioactivity. These data suggest the existence of a negative regulation of this cross talk between OCN and insulin. Recently, we identified delta like-1 (DLK1) as an endocrine regulator of bone turnover. Because DLK1 is colocalized with insulin in pancreatic \u03b2-cells, we examined the role of DLK1 in insulin signaling in OBs and energy metabolism. We show that Glu-OCN specifically stimulates Dlk1 expression by the pancreas. Conversely, Dlk1-deficient (Dlk1(-/-) ) mice exhibited increased circulating Glu-OCN levels and increased insulin sensitivity, whereas mice overexpressing Dlk1 in OB displayed reduced insulin secretion and sensitivity due to impaired insulin signaling in OB and lowered Glu-OCN serum levels. Furthermore, Dlk1(-/-) mice treated with Glu-OC experienced significantly lower blood glucose levels than Glu-OCN-treated wild-type mice. The data suggest that Glu-OCN-controlled production of DLK1 by pancreatic \u03b2-cells acts as a negative feedback mechanism to counteract the stimulatory effects of insulin on OB production of Glu-OCN, a potential mechanism preventing OCN-induced hypoglycemia.",

        "Abstract": "Central serotonin (5-HT) is an anorexigenic neurotransmitter in the brain. However, accumulating evidence suggests peripheral 5-HT may affect organismal energy homeostasis. Here we show 5-HT regulates white and brown adipose tissue function. Pharmacological inhibition of 5-HT synthesis leads to inhibition of lipogenesis in epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT), induction of browning in inguinal WAT and activation of adaptive thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Mice with inducible Tph1 KO in adipose tissues exhibit a similar phenotype as mice in which 5-HT synthesis is inhibited pharmacologically, suggesting 5-HT has localized effects on adipose tissues. In addition, Htr3a KO mice exhibit increased energy expenditure and reduced weight gain when fed a high-fat diet. Treatment with an Htr2a antagonist reduces lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These data suggest important roles for adipocyte-derived 5-HT in controlling energy homeostasis.",

        "Title": "An overview of the metabolic functions of osteocalcin.",
        "Abstract": "A recent unexpected development of bone biology is that bone is an endocrine organ regulating a growing number of physiological processes. One of the functions regulated by bone through the hormone osteocalcin is glucose homeostasis. In this overview, we will explain why we hypothesized that bone mass and energy metabolism should be subjected to a coordinated endocrine regulation. We will then review the experiments that revealed the endocrine function of osteocalcin and the cell biology events that allow osteocalcin to become a hormone. We will also illustrate the importance of this regulation to understand whole-body glucose homeostasis in the physiological state and in pathological conditions. Lastly, we will mention epidemiological and genetic evidence demonstrating that this function of osteocalcin is conserved in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Osteocalcin (OCN) is an osteoblast-derived hormone favoring glucose homeostasis, energy expenditure, male fertility, brain development, and cognition. Before being secreted by osteoblasts in the bone extracellular matrix, OCN is \u03b3-carboxylated by the \u03b3-carboxylase (GGCX) on three glutamic acid residues, a cellular process requiring reduction of vitamin K (VK) by a second enzyme, a reductase called VKORC1. Although circumstantial evidence suggests that \u03b3-carboxylation may inhibit OCN endocrine functions, genetic evidence that it is the case is still lacking. Here we show using cell-specific gene inactivation models that \u03b3-carboxylation of OCN by GGCX inhibits its endocrine function. We further show that VKORC1 is required for OCN \u03b3-carboxylation in osteoblasts, whereas its paralogue, VKORC1L1, is dispensable for this function and cannot compensate for the absence of VKORC1 in osteoblasts. This study genetically and biochemically delineates the functions of the enzymes required for OCN modification and demonstrates that it is the uncarboxylated form of OCN that acts as a hormone.",

OSA, the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing, has been linked to multiple cardiovascular, metabolic, hormonal, and inflammatory derangements and may have adverse effects on bone. However, little is known about how OSA (including the associated hypoxia and sleep loss) affects bone metabolism. In order to gain insight into the relationship between sleep and bone, we review the growing information on OSA and metabolic bone disease and discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms by which OSA may affect bone metabolism/architecture.",

One model suggests that perisinusoidal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) give rise to osteoblasts, chondrocytes, marrow stromal cells, and adipocytes, although the existence of these cells has not been proven through fate-mapping experiments. We demonstrate here that expression of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist gremlin 1 defines a population of osteochondroreticular (OCR) stem cells in the bone marrow. OCR stem cells self-renew and generate osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and reticular marrow stromal cells, but not adipocytes. OCR stem cells are concentrated within the metaphysis of long bones not in the perisinusoidal space and are needed for bone development, bone remodeling, and fracture repair. Grem1 expression also identifies intestinal reticular stem cells (iRSCs) that are cells of origin for the periepithelial intestinal mesenchymal sheath. Grem1 expression identifies distinct connective tissue stem cells in both the bone (OCR stem cells) and the intestine (iRSCs).",

        "Abstract": "JMJD3 (KDM6B) is an H3K27me3 demethylase and counteracts polycomb-mediated transcription repression. However, the function of JMJD3 in vivo is not well understood. Here we show that JMJD3 is highly expressed in cells of the chondrocyte lineage, especially in prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes, during endochondral ossification. Homozygous deletion of Jmjd3 results in severely decreased proliferation and delayed hypertrophy of chondrocytes, and thereby marked retardation of endochondral ossification in mice. Genetically, JMJD3 associates with RUNX2 to promote proliferation and hypertrophy of chondrocytes. Biochemically, JMJD3 associates with and enhances RUNX2 activity by derepression of Runx2 and Ihh transcription through its H3K27me3 demethylase activity. These results demonstrate that JMJD3 is a key epigenetic regulator in the process of cartilage maturation during endochondral bone formation.",

        "Abstract": "A recent unexpected development of bone biology is that bone is an endocrine organ contributing to the regulation of a number of physiological processes. One of the functions regulated by bone through osteocalcin, an osteoblast specific hormone, is glucose homeostasis. In this overview, we explain the rationale why we hypothesized that there should be a coordinated endocrine regulation between bone mass and energy metabolism. We then review the experiments that identified the endocrine function of osteocalcin and the cell biology events that allow osteocalcin to become a hormone. We also demonstrate the importance of this regulation to understand whole-body glucose homeostasis in the physiological state and in pathological conditions. Lastly we discuss the epidemiological and genetic evidence demonstrating that this function of osteocalcin is conserved in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Our knowledge of whole organism physiology has greatly advanced in the past decades through mouse genetics. In particular, genetic studies have revealed that most organs interact with one another through hormones in order to maintain normal physiological functions and the homeostasis of the entire organism. Remarkably, through these studies many unexpected novel endocrine means to regulate physiological functions have been uncovered. The skeletal system is one example. In this article, we review a series of studies that over the years have identified bone as an endocrine organ. The mechanism of action, pathological relevance, and therapeutic implications of the functions of the bone-derived hormone osteocalcin are discussed. In the last part of this review we discuss the possibility that additional endocrine functions of the skeleton may exist.",

        "Title": "Functional role of serotonin in insulin secretion in a diet-induced insulin-resistant state.",
        "Abstract": "The physiological role of serotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), in pancreatic \u03b2-cell function was previously elucidated using a pregnant mouse model. During pregnancy, 5-HT increases \u03b2-cell proliferation and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) through the G\u03b1q-coupled 5-HT2b receptor (Htr2b) and the 5-HT3 receptor (Htr3), a ligand-gated cation channel, respectively. However, the role of 5-HT in \u03b2-cell function in an insulin-resistant state has yet to be elucidated. Here, we characterized the metabolic phenotypes of \u03b2-cell-specific Htr2b(-/-) (Htr2b \u03b2KO), Htr3a(-/-) (Htr3a knock-out [KO]), and \u03b2-cell-specific tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1)(-/-) (Tph1 \u03b2KO) mice on a high-fat diet (HFD). Htr2b \u03b2KO, Htr3a KO, and Tph1 \u03b2KO mice exhibited normal glucose tolerance on a standard chow diet. After 6 weeks on an HFD, beginning at 4 weeks of age, both Htr3a KO and Tph1 \u03b2KO mice developed glucose intolerance, but Htr2b \u03b2KO mice remained normoglycemic. Pancreas perfusion assays revealed defective first-phase insulin secretion in Htr3a KO mice. GSIS was impaired in islets isolated from HFD-fed Htr3a KO and Tph1 \u03b2KO mice, and 5-HT treatment improved insulin secretion from Tph1 \u03b2KO islets but not from Htr3a KO islets. Tph1 and Htr3a gene expression in pancreatic islets was not affected by an HFD, and immunostaining could not detect 5-HT in pancreatic islets from mice fed an HFD. Taken together, these results demonstrate that basal 5-HT levels in \u03b2-cells play a role in GSIS through Htr3, which becomes more evident in a diet-induced insulin-resistant state.",

        "Abstract": "The emergence of bone as an endocrine regulator has prompted a re-evaluation of the role of bone mineralization factors in the development of metabolic disease. Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1 (NPP1) controls bone mineralization through the generation of pyrophosphate, and levels of NPP1 are elevated both in dermal fibroblast cultures and muscle of individuals with insulin resistance. We investigated the metabolic phenotype associated with impaired bone metabolism in mice lacking the gene that encodes NPP1 (Enpp1(-/-) mice). Enpp1(-/-) mice exhibited mildly improved glucose homeostasis on a normal diet but showed a pronounced resistance to obesity and insulin resistance in response to chronic high-fat feeding. Enpp1(-/-) mice had increased levels of the insulin-sensitizing bone-derived hormone osteocalcin but unchanged insulin signalling within osteoblasts. A fuller understanding of the pathways of NPP1 could inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating insulin resistance.",

        "Abstract": "The transcription factor FoxO1 regulates multiple physiological processes. Here, we show that FoxO1 is highly expressed in neurons of the locus coeruleus and of various sympathetic ganglions, but not in the adrenal medulla. Consistent with this pattern of expression, mice lacking FoxO1 only in sympathetic neurons (FoxO1 Dbh-/-) display a low sympathetic tone without modification of the catecholamine content in the adrenal medulla. As a result, FoxO1 Dbh-/- mice demonstrate an increased insulin secretion, improved glucose tolerance, low energy expenditure, and high bone mass. FoxO1 favors catecholamine synthesis because it is a potent regulator of the expression of Dbh that encodes the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of these neurotransmitters. By identifying FoxO1 as a transcriptional regulator of the sympathetic tone, these results advance our understanding of the control of some aspects of metabolism and of bone mass accrual.",

        "Title": "HDAC4 integrates PTH and sympathetic signaling in osteoblasts.",
        "Abstract": "Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the sympathetic tone promote Rankl expression in osteoblasts and osteoclast differentiation by enhancing cyclic adenosine monophosphate production through an unidentified transcription factor for PTH and through ATF4 for the sympathetic tone. How two extracellular cues using the same second messenger in the same cell elicit different transcriptional events is unknown. In this paper, we show that PTH favors Rankl expression by triggering the ubiquitination of HDAC4, a class II histone deacetylase, via Smurf2. HDAC4 degradation releases MEF2c, which transactivates the Rankl promoter. Conversely, sympathetic signaling in osteoblasts favors the accumulation of HDAC4 in the nucleus and its association with ATF4. In this context, HDAC4 increases Rankl expression. Because of its ability to differentially connect two extracellular cues to the genome of osteoblasts, HDAC4 is a critical regulator of osteoclast differentiation.",

        "Title": "FGF-21 and skeletal remodeling during and after lactation in C57BL/6J mice.",
        "Abstract": "Lactation is associated with significant alterations in both body composition and bone mass. Systemic and local skeletal factors such as receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03ba-B ligand (RANKL), PTHrP, calcitonin, and estrogen are known to regulate bone remodeling during and after lactation. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) may function as an endocrine factor to regulate body composition changes during lactation by inducing gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. In this study, we hypothesized that the metabolic changes during lactation were due in part to increased circulating FGF-21, which in turn could accentuate bone loss. We longitudinally characterized body composition in C57BL/6J (B6) mice during (day 7 and day 21 of lactation) and after normal lactation (day 21 postlactation). At day 7 of lactation, areal bone density declined by 10% (P < .001), bone resorption increased (P < .0001), percent fat decreased by 20%, energy expenditure increased (P < .01), and markers of brown-like adipogenesis were suppressed in the inguinal depot and in preformed brown adipose tissue. At day 7 of lactation there was a 2.4-fold increase in serum FGF-21 vs baseline (P < .0001), a 8-fold increase in hepatic FGF-21 mRNA (P < .03), a 2-fold increase in undercarboxylated osteocalcin (Glu13 OCn) (P < .01), and enhanced insulin sensitivity. Recovery of total areal bone density was noted at day 21 of lactation, whereas the femoral trabecular bone volume fraction was still reduced (P < .01). Because FGF-21 levels rose rapidly at day 7 of lactation in B6 lactating mice, we next examined lactating mice with a deletion in the Fgf21 gene. Trabecular and cortical bone masses were maintained throughout lactation in FGF-21(-/-) mice, and pup growth was normal. Compared with lactating control mice, lactating FGF-21(-/-) mice exhibited an increase in bone formation, but no change in bone resorption. In conclusion, in addition to changes in calciotropic hormones, systemic FGF-21 plays a role in skeletal remodeling and changes in body composition during lactation in B6 mice.",

        "Abstract": "Insulin signaling in osteoblasts has been shown recently to contribute to whole-body glucose homeostasis in animals fed a normal diet; however, it is unknown whether bone contributes to the insulin resistance that develops in animals challenged by a high-fat diet (HFD). Here, we evaluated the consequences of osteoblast-specific overexpression of or loss of insulin receptor in HFD-fed mice. We determined that the severity of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance that mice develop when fed a HFD is in part a consequence of osteoblast-dependent insulin resistance. Insulin resistance in osteoblasts led to a decrease in circulating levels of the active form of osteocalcin, thereby decreasing insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. Insulin resistance developed in osteoblasts as the result of increased levels of free saturated fatty acids, which promote insulin receptor ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Together, these results underscore the involvement of bone, among other tissues, in the disruption of whole-body glucose homeostasis resulting from a HFD and the involvement of insulin and osteocalcin cross-talk in glucose intolerance. Furthermore, our data indicate that insulin resistance develops in bone as the result of lipotoxicity-associated loss of insulin receptors.",

        "Abstract": "Insulin signaling in osteoblasts regulates global energy balance by stimulating the production of osteocalcin, a bone-derived protein that promotes insulin production and action. To identify the signaling pathways in osteoblasts that mediate insulin's effects on bone and energy metabolism, we examined the function of the tuberous sclerosis 2 (Tsc2) protein, a key target important in coordinating nutrient signaling. Here, we show that loss of Tsc2 in osteoblasts constitutively activates mTOR and destabilizes Irs1, causing osteoblasts to differentiate poorly and become resistant to insulin. Young Tsc2 mutant mice demonstrate hypoglycemia with increased levels of insulin and undercarboxylated osteocalcin. However, with age, Tsc2 mutants develop metabolic features similar to mice lacking the insulin receptor in the osteoblast, including peripheral adiposity, hyperglycemia, and decreased pancreatic \u03b2 cell mass. These metabolic abnormalities appear to result from chronic elevations in undercarboxylated osteocalcin that lead to downregulation of the osteocalcin receptor and desensitization of the \u03b2 cell to this hormone. Removal of a single mTOR allele from the Tsc2 mutant mice largely normalizes the bone and metabolic abnormalities. Together, these findings suggest that Tsc2 serves as a key checkpoint in the osteoblast that is required for proper insulin signaling and acts to ensure normal bone acquisition and energy homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Osteocalcin is a hormone produced in bones by osteoblasts and regulating energy metabolism. While osteocalcin exists in two forms, \u03b3-carboxylated and undercarboxylated only the latter appears to function as a hormone in vivo. It has been proposed recently that osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells, are responsible of decarboxylating, i.e. activating osteocalcin. To address the role of osteoclasts in the maintenance of energy metabolism we analyzed mutant mouse strains harboring either an increase or a decrease in osteoclasts number. Osteoprotegerin-deficient mice that are characterized by an increase in the number of osteoclasts demonstrate an increase in serum levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin and are significantly more glucose tolerant than WT animals. Conversely, osteoclasts ablation in mice results in a decrease in serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels and in reduced glucose tolerance. These results support the notion that osteoclasts are controlling glucose metabolism at least in part through the regulation of osteocalcin decarboxylation.",

        "Abstract": "Traditionally, bone has been viewed as a relatively static tissue only fulfilling mechanical and scaffolding function. In the past decade however, this classical view of the bone has considerably evolved towards a more complex picture. It is now clear that the skeleton is not only a recipient for hormonal input but it is also an endocrine organ itself. Through the secretion of an osteoblast-derived molecule, osteocalcin, the skeleton regulates glucose homeostasis and male reproductive functions. When undercarboxylated, osteocalcin acts following its binding to a G-coupled receptor, Gprc6a, on pancreatic \u03b2 cells to increase insulin secretion, on muscle and white adipose tissue to promote glucose homeostasis and on Leydig cells of the testis to favor testosterone biosynthesis. More recently, it was also shown that osteocalcin acts via a pancreas-bone-testis axis that regulates, independently of and in parallel to the hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis, male reproductive functions by promoting testosterone biosynthesis. Lastly, in trying to expand the biological relevance of osteocalcin from mouse to human, it was shown that Gprc6a is a potential new susceptibility locus for primary testicular failure in humans. Altogether, these results shed new light on the importance of the endocrine role of the skeleton and also provide credence to the search for additional endocrine functions of this organ.",

        "Abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common endocrine disorder in females of reproductive age and is believed to have a developmental origin in which gestational androgenization programs reproductive and metabolic abnormalities in offspring. During gestation, both male and female fetuses are exposed to potential androgen excess. In this study, we determined the consequences of developmental androgenization in male mice exposed to neonatal testosterone (NTM). Adult NTM displayed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with decreased serum testosterone and gonadotropin concentrations. Hypothalamic KiSS1 neurons are believed to be critical to the onset of puberty and are the target of leptin. Adult NTM exhibited lower hypothalamic Kiss1 expression and a failure of leptin to upregulate Kiss1 expression. NTM displayed an early reduction in lean mass, decreased locomotor activity, and decreased energy expenditure. They displayed a delayed increase in subcutaneous white adipose tissue amounts. Thus, excessive neonatal androgenization disrupts reproduction and energy homeostasis and predisposes to hypogonadism and obesity in adult male mice.",

        "Abstract": "The powerful regulation of bone mass exerted by the brain suggests the existence of bone-derived signals modulating this regulation or other functions of the brain. We show here that the osteoblast-derived hormone osteocalcin crosses the blood-brain barrier, binds to neurons of the brainstem, midbrain, and hippocampus, enhances the synthesis of monoamine neurotransmitters, inhibits GABA synthesis, prevents anxiety and depression, and favors learning and memory independently of its metabolic functions. In addition to these postnatal functions, maternal osteocalcin crosses the placenta during pregnancy and prevents neuronal apoptosis before embryos synthesize this hormone. As a result, the severity of the neuroanatomical defects and learning and memory deficits of Osteocalcin(-/-) mice is determined by the maternal genotype, and delivering osteocalcin to pregnant Osteocalcin(-/-) mothers rescues these abnormalities in their Osteocalcin(-/-) progeny. This study reveals that the skeleton via osteocalcin influences cognition and contributes to the maternal influence on fetal brain development.",

        "Abstract": "Expanding \u03b2-cell mass through \u03b2-cell proliferation is considered a potential therapeutic approach to treat \u03b2-cell failure in diabetic patients. A necessary step toward achieving this goal is to identify signaling pathways that regulate \u03b2-cell proliferation in vivo. Here we show that osteocalcin, a bone-derived hormone, regulates \u03b2-cell replication in a cyclin D1-dependent manner by signaling through the Gprc6a receptor expressed in these cells. Accordingly, mice lacking Gprc6a in the \u03b2-cell lineage only are glucose intolerant due to an impaired ability to produce insulin. Remarkably, this regulation occurs during both the perinatal peak of \u03b2-cell proliferation and in adulthood. Hence, the loss of osteocalcin/Gprc6a signaling has a profound effect on \u03b2-cell mass accrual during late pancreas morphogenesis. This study extends the endocrine role of osteocalcin to the developmental period and establishes osteocalcin/Gprc6a signaling as a major regulator of \u03b2-cell endowment that can become a potential target for \u03b2-cell proliferative therapies.",

        "Abstract": "In order to resorb the mineralized bone extracellular matrix, the osteoclast relies on the generation of a resorption lacuna characterized by the presence of specific proteases and a low pH. Hence, bone resorption by osteoclasts is highly dependent on lysosomes, the organelles specialized in intra- and extracellular material degradation. This is best illustrated by the fact that multiple forms of human osteopetrosis are caused by mutations in genes encoding for lysosomal proteins. Yet, until recently, the molecular mechanisms regulating lysosomal biogenesis and function in osteoclasts were poorly understood. Here we review the latest developments in the study of lysosomal biogenesis and function in osteoclasts with an emphasis on the transcriptional control of these processes.",

        "Abstract": "The osteoblast-derived hormone osteocalcin promotes testosterone biosynthesis in the mouse testis by binding to GPRC6A in Leydig cells. Interestingly, Osteocalcin-deficient mice exhibit increased levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), a pituitary hormone that regulates sex steroid synthesis in the testes. These observations raise the question of whether LH regulates osteocalcin's reproductive effects. Additionally, there is growing evidence that osteocalcin levels are a reliable marker of insulin secretion and sensitivity and circulating levels of testosterone in humans, but the endocrine function of osteocalcin is unclear. Using mouse models, we found that osteocalcin and LH act in 2 parallel pathways and that osteocalcin-stimulated testosterone synthesis is positively regulated by bone resorption and insulin signaling in osteoblasts. To determine the importance of osteocalcin in humans, we analyzed a cohort of patients with primary testicular failure and identified 2 individuals harboring the same heterozygous missense variant in one of the transmembrane domains of GPRC6A, which prevented the receptor from localizing to the cell membrane. This study uncovers the existence of a second endocrine axis that is necessary for optimal male fertility in the mouse and suggests that osteocalcin modulates reproductive function in humans.",

        "Abstract": "The synthesis of adiponectin, an adipokine with ill-defined functions in animals fed a normal diet, is enhanced by the osteoblast-derived hormone osteocalcin. Here we show that adiponectin signals back in osteoblasts to hamper their proliferation and favor their apoptosis, altogether decreasing bone mass and circulating osteocalcin levels. Adiponectin fulfills these functions, independently of its known receptors and signaling pathways, by decreasing FoxO1 activity in a PI3-kinase-dependent manner. Over time, however, these local effects are masked because adiponectin signals in neurons of the locus coeruleus, also through FoxO1, to decrease the sympathetic tone, thereby increasing bone mass and decreasing energy expenditure. This study reveals that adiponectin has the unusual ability to regulate the same function in two opposite manners depending on where it acts and that it opposes, partially, leptin's influence on the sympathetic nervous system. It also proposes that adiponectin regulation of bone mass occurs through a PI3-kinase-FoxO1 pathway.",

        "Title": "Developmental androgen excess programs sympathetic tone and adipose tissue dysfunction and predisposes to a cardiometabolic syndrome in female mice.",
        "Abstract": "Among women, the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is considered a form of metabolic syndrome with reproductive abnormalities. Women with PCOS show increased sympathetic tone, visceral adiposity with enlarged adipocytes, hypoadiponectinemia, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, increased inactive osteocalcin, and hypertension. Excess fetal exposure to androgens has been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. Previously, we showed that neonatal exposure to the androgen testosterone (NT) programs leptin resistance in adult female mice. Here, we studied the impact of NT on lean and adipose tissues, sympathetic tone in cardiometabolic tissues, and the development of metabolic dysfunction in mice. Neonatally androgenized adult female mice (NTF) displayed masculinization of lean tissues with increased cardiac and skeletal muscle as well as kidney masses. NTF mice showed increased and dysfunctional white adipose tissue with increased sympathetic tone in both visceral and subcutaneous fat as well as increased number of enlarged and insulin-resistant adipocytes that displayed altered expression of developmental genes and hypoadiponectinemia. NTF exhibited dysfunctional brown adipose tissue with increased mass and decreased energy expenditure. They also displayed decreased undercarboxylated and active osteocalcin and were predisposed to obesity during chronic androgen excess. NTF showed increased renal sympathetic tone associated with increased blood pressure, and they developed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Thus, developmental exposure to testosterone in female mice programs features of cardiometabolic dysfunction, as can be observed in women with PCOS, including increased sympathetic tone, visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, prediabetes, and hypertension.",

        "Abstract": "Bone resorption by osteoclasts requires a large number of lysosomes that release proteases in the resorption lacuna. Whether lysosomal biogenesis is a consequence of the action of transcriptional regulators of osteoclast differentiation or is under the control of a different and specific transcriptional pathway remains unknown. We show here, through cell-based assays and cell-specific gene deletion experiments in mice, that the osteoclast differentiation factor RANKL promotes lysosomal biogenesis once osteoclasts are differentiated through the selective activation of TFEB, a member of the MITF/TFE family of transcription factors. This occurs following PKC\u03b2 phosphorylation of TFEB on three serine residues located in its last 15 amino acids. This post-translational modification stabilizes and increases the activity of this transcription factor. Supporting these biochemical observations, mice lacking in osteoclasts--either TFEB or PKC\u03b2--show decreased lysosomal gene expression and increased bone mass. Altogether, these results uncover a RANKL-dependent signaling pathway taking place in differentiated osteoclasts and culminating in the activation of TFEB to enhance lysosomal biogenesis-a necessary step for proper bone resorption.",

        "Abstract": "The role of brain stem serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in autoresuscitation in neonatal life is unclear. We hypothesized that a specific loss of 5-HT would compromise gasping and autoresuscitation mainly in the second postnatal week and that acute restoration of 5-HT would reverse the defects. We exposed postnatal day (P)4-5, P8-9, and P11-12 tryptophan-hydroxylase-2 knockout (TPH2(-/-)) and wild-type littermates (WT) to 10 episodes of anoxia (97% N2, 3% CO2), measuring survival, gasp latency, gasp frequency (fB), and the time required to restore eupnea and heart rate. We also tested P8-9 TPH2(-/-) mice after restoring 5-HT with a single injection of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) 1-2 h before testing or with multiple injections beginning 24 h before testing. At P4-5 and P8-9, but not at P11-12, gasp latency and the recovery of eupnea were delayed ~2- to 3-fold in TPH2(-/-) pups compared with WT (P < 0.001). At all ages, TPH2(-/-) pups displayed reduced gasp fB (~20-30%; P < 0.001) and delayed heart rate recovery (~60%; P = 0.002) compared with WT littermates. TPH2(-/-) survival was reduced compared with WT (P < 0.001), especially at P8-9 and P11-12 (P = 0.004). Whereas 1-2 h of 5-HTP treatment improved the gasp latency and fB of P8-9 TPH2(-/-) pups, improved cardiorespiratory recovery and survival required 24 h of treatment. Our data suggest that 5-HT operates over a long time span (24 h) to improve survival during episodic severe hypoxia. Early in development (P4-9), 5-HT is critical for both respiratory and cardiovascular components of autoresuscitation; later (P11-12), it is critical mainly for cardiovascular components. Nevertheless, the effect of 5-HT deficiency on survival is most striking from P8 to P12.",

        "Abstract": "Global gene deletion studies in mice and humans have established the pivotal role of runt related transcription factor-2 (Runx2) in both intramembranous and endochondral ossification processes during skeletogenesis. In this study, we for the first time generated mice carrying a conditional Runx2 allele with exon 4, which encodes the Runt domain, flanked by loxP sites. These mice were crossed with \u03b11(I)-collagen-Cre or \u03b11(II)-collagen-Cre transgenic mice to obtain osteoblast-specific or chondrocyte-specific Runx2 deficient mice, respectively. As seen in Runx2(-/-) mice, perinatal lethality was observed in \u03b11(II)-Cre;Runx2(flox/flox) mice, but this was not the case in animals in which \u03b11(I)-collagen-Cre was used to delete Runx2. When using double-staining with Alizarin red for mineralized matrix and Alcian blue for cartilaginous matrix, we observed previously that mineralization was totally absent at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) throughout the body in Runx2(-/-) mice, but was found in areas undergoing intramembranous ossification such as skull and clavicles in \u03b11(II)-Cre;Runx2(flox/flox) mice. In newborn \u03b11(II)-Cre;Runx2(flox/flox) mice, mineralization impairment was restricted to skeletal areas undergoing endochondral ossification including long bones and vertebrae. In contrast, no apparent skeletal abnormalities were seen in mutant embryo, newborn, and 3-week-old to 6-week old-mice in which Runx2 had been deleted with the \u03b11(I)-collagen-Cre driver. These results suggest that Runx2 is absolutely required for endochondral ossification during embryonic and postnatal skeletogenesis, but that disrupting its expression in already committed osteoblasts as achieved here with the \u03b11(I)-collagen-Cre driver does not affect overtly intramembranous and endochondral ossification. The Runx2 floxed allele established here is undoubtedly useful for investigating the role of Runx2 in particular cells.",

        "Abstract": "Early B-cell factor 1 (Ebf1) is a transcription factor whose inactivation in all cells results in high bone mass because of an increase in bone formation. This observation suggests Ebf1 may be an inhibitor of osteoblast differentiation. To test this contention, we analyzed Ebf1 pattern of expression and function in osteoblasts ex vivo and in vivo through osteoblast-specific inactivation in the mouse. We show here that in vivo deletion of Ebf1 in osteoblast progenitors does not affect osteoblast differentiation or bone formation accrual post-natally. These observations indicate that the phenotype described in Ebf1(-/)(-) mice is not osteoblast-autonomous.",

        "Title": "Vitamin D receptor in osteoblasts is a negative regulator of bone mass control.",
        "Abstract": "The physiological and beneficial actions of vitamin D in bone health have been experimentally and clinically proven in mammals. The active form of vitamin D [1\u03b1,25(OH)(2)D(3)] binds and activates its specific nuclear receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Activated VDR prevents the release of calcium from its storage in bone to serum by stimulating intestinal calcium absorption and renal reabsorption. However, the direct action of VDR in bone tissue is poorly understood because serum Ca(2+) homeostasis is maintained through tightly regulated ion transport by the kidney, intestine, and bone. In addition, conventional genetic approaches using VDR knockout (VDR-KO, VDR(-/-)) mice could not identify VDR action in bone because of the animals' systemic defects in calcium metabolism. In this study, we report that systemic VDR heterozygous KO (VDR(+/L-)) mice generated with the Cre/loxP system as well as conventional VDR heterozygotes (VDR(+/-)) showed increased bone mass in radiological assessments. Because mineral metabolism parameters were unaltered in both types of mice, these bone phenotypes imply that skeletal VDR plays a role in bone mass regulation. To confirm this assumption, osteoblast-specific VDR-KO (VDR(\u0394Ob/\u0394Ob)) mice were generated with 2.3 kb \u03b11(I)-collagen promoter-Cre transgenic mice. They showed a bone mass increase without any dysregulation of mineral metabolism. Although bone formation parameters were not affected in bone histomorphometry, bone resorption was obviously reduced in VDR(\u0394Ob/\u0394Ob) mice because of decreased expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (an essential molecule in osteoclastogenesis) in VDR(\u0394Ob/\u0394Ob) osteoblasts. These findings establish that VDR in osteoblasts is a negative regulator of bone mass control.",

        "Abstract": "Mastermind-like 1 (MAML1) is a transcriptional co-activator in the Notch signaling pathway. Recently, however, several reports revealed novel and unique roles for MAML1 that are independent of the Notch signaling pathway. We found that MAML1 enhances the transcriptional activity of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), a transcription factor essential for osteoblastic differentiation and chondrocyte proliferation and maturation. MAML1 significantly enhanced the Runx2-mediated transcription of the p6OSE2-Luc reporter, in which luciferase expression was controlled by six copies of the osteoblast specific element 2 (OSE2) from the Runx2-regulated osteocalcin gene promoter. Interestingly, a deletion mutant of MAML1 lacking the N-terminal Notch-binding domain also enhanced Runx2-mediated transcription. Moreover, inhibition of Notch signaling did not affect the action of MAML1 on Runx2, suggesting that the activation of Runx2 by MAML1 may be caused in a Notch-independent manner. Overexpression of MAML1 transiently enhanced the Runx2-mediated expression of alkaline phosphatase, an early marker of osteoblast differentiation, in the murine pluripotent mesenchymal cell line C3H10T1/2. MAML1(-/-) embryos at embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) had shorter bone lengths than wild-type embryos. The area of primary spongiosa of the femoral diaphysis was narrowed. At E14.5, extended zone of collagen type II alpha 1 (Col2a1) and Sox9 expression, markers of chondrocyte differentiation, and decreased zone of collagen type X alpha 1 (Col10a1) expression, a marker of hypertrophic chondrocyte, were observed. These observations suggest that chondrocyte maturation was impaired in MAML1(-/-) mice. MAML1 enhances the transcriptional activity of Runx2 and plays a role in bone development.",

        "Abstract": "Impaired lung function caused by decreased airway diameter (bronchoconstriction) is frequently observed whether body weight is abnormally high or low. That these opposite conditions affect the airways similarly suggests that the regulation of airway diameter and body weight are intertwined. We show here that, independently of its regulation of appetite, melanocortin pathway, or sympathetic tone, leptin is\u00a0necessary and sufficient to increase airway diameter by signaling through its cognate receptor in cholinergic neurons. The latter decreases parasympathetic signaling through the M(3) muscarinic receptor in airway smooth muscle cells, thereby increasing airway diameter without affecting local inflammation.\u00a0Accordingly, decreasing parasympathetic tone genetically or pharmacologically corrects bronchoconstriction and normalizes lung function in obese mice regardless of bronchial inflammation. This study reveals an adipocyte-dependent regulation of bronchial diameter whose disruption contributes to the impaired lung function caused by abnormal body weight. These findings may be of use in the management of obesity-associated asthma.",

        "Abstract": "Energy release from cellular storage is mandatory for survival during fasting. This is achieved through lipolysis and liver gluconeogenesis. We show here that in the mouse, gut-derived serotonin (GDS) is upregulated during fasting and that it favors both mechanisms. In adipocytes, GDS signals through the Htr2b receptor to favor lipolysis by increasing phosphorylation and activity of hormone-sensitive lipase. In hepatocytes, GDS signaling through Htr2b promotes gluconeogenesis by enhancing activity of two rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzymes, FBPase and G6Pase. In addition, GDS signaling in hepatocytes prevents glucose uptake in a Glut2-dependent manner, thereby further favoring maintenance of blood glucose levels. As a result, inhibition of GDS synthesis can improve glucose intolerance caused by high-fat diet. Hence, GDS opposes deleterious consequences of food deprivation by favoring lipolysis and liver gluconeogenesis while preventing glucose uptake by hepatocytes. As a result, pharmacological inhibition of its synthesis may contribute to improve type 2 diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "A screen of microRNAs preferentially expressed in osteoblasts identified members of the miR-34 family as regulators of osteoblast proliferation and/or differentiation. Osteoblast-specific gain- and loss-of-function experiments performed in vivo revealed that miR-34b and -c affected skeletogenesis during embryonic development, as well as bone mass accrual after birth, through two complementary cellular and molecular mechanisms. First, they inhibited osteoblast proliferation by suppressing Cyclin D1, CDK4, and CDK6 accumulation. Second, they inhibited terminal differentiation of osteoblasts, at least in part through the inhibition of SATB2, a nuclear matrix protein that is a critical determinant of osteoblast differentiation. Genetic evidence obtained in the mouse confirmed the importance of SATB2 regulation by miR-34b/c. These results are the first to identify a family of microRNAs involved in bone formation in vivo and to identify a specific genetic pathway by which these microRNAs regulate osteoblast differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "Parathyroid hormone (PTH), the major calcium-regulating hormone, and norepinephrine (NE), the principal neurotransmitter of sympathetic nerves, regulate bone remodeling by activating distinct cell-surface G protein-coupled receptors in osteoblasts: the parathyroid hormone type 1 receptor (PTHR) and the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(2)AR), respectively. These receptors activate a common cAMP/PKA signal transduction pathway mediated through the stimulatory heterotrimeric G protein. Activation of \u03b2(2)AR via the sympathetic nervous system decreases bone formation and increases bone resorption. Conversely, daily injection of PTH (1-34), a regimen known as intermittent (i)PTH treatment, increases bone mass through the stimulation of trabecular and cortical bone formation and decreases fracture incidences in severe cases of osteoporosis. Here, we show that iPTH has no osteoanabolic activity in mice lacking the \u03b2(2)AR. \u03b2(2)AR deficiency suppressed both iPTH-induced increase in bone formation and resorption. We showed that the lack of \u03b2(2)AR blocks expression of iPTH-target genes involved in bone formation and resorption that are regulated by the cAMP/PKA pathway. These data implicate an unexpected functional interaction between PTHR and \u03b2(2)AR, two G protein-coupled receptors from distinct families, which control bone formation and PTH anabolism.",

        "Abstract": "It has long been known that sex steroid hormones regulate bone mass accrual. This observation raises the testable hypothesis that bone may in turn regulate the synthesis and secretion of sex steroid hormones in one or both genders. This hypothesis is comprised within a more general hypothesis that bone mass, energy metabolism, and reproduction are regulated coordinately. The identification of osteocalcin as an osteoblast-specific secreted molecule allows us to address this question in molecular terms. This review details how the regulation of male fertility by osteocalcin was unraveled, and how osteocalcin signaling in Leydig cells of the testis occurs. It also discusses the implication of this novel mode of regulation of testosterone synthesis observed in males but not in females.",

        "Title": "Sulfatases are determinants of alveolar formation.",
        "Abstract": "Alveolar formation or alveolarization is orchestrated by a finely regulated and complex interaction between growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins. The lung parenchyma contains various extracellular matrix proteins including proteoglycans, which are composed of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked to a protein core. Although GAGs are known to regulate growth factor distribution and activity according to their degree of sulfation the role of sulfated GAG in the respiratory system is not well understood. The degree of sulfation of GAGs is regulated in part, by sulfatases that remove sulfate groups. In vertebrates, the enzyme Sulfatase-Modifying Factor 1 (Sumf1) activates all sulfatases. Here we utilized mice lacking Sumf1(-/-) to study the importance of proteoglycan desulfation in lung development. The Sumf1(-/-) mice have normal lungs up until the onset of alveolarization at post-natal day 5 (P5). We detected increased deposition of sulfated GAG throughout the lung parenchyma and a decrease in alveolar septa formation. Moreover, stereological analysis showed that the alveolar volume is 20% larger in Sumf1(-/-) as compared to wild type (WT) mice at P10 and P30. Additionally, pulmonary function test was consistent with increased alveolar volume. Genetic experiments demonstrate that in Sumf1(-/-) mice arrest of alveolarization is independent of fibroblast growth factor signaling. In turn, the Sumf1(-/-) mice have increased transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) signaling and in vivo injection of TGF\u03b2 neutralizing antibody leads to normalization of alveolarization. Thus, absence of sulfatase activity increases sulfated GAG deposition in the lungs causing deregulation of TGF\u03b2 signaling and arrest of alveolarization.",

        "Abstract": "The lysosome plays a key role in cellular homeostasis by controlling both cellular clearance and energy production to respond to environmental cues. However, the mechanisms mediating lysosomal adaptation are largely unknown. Here, we show that the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, colocalizes with master growth regulator mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) on the lysosomal membrane. When nutrients are present, phosphorylation of TFEB by mTORC1 inhibits TFEB activity. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1, as well as starvation and lysosomal disruption, activates TFEB by promoting its nuclear translocation. In addition, the transcriptional response of lysosomal and autophagic genes to either lysosomal dysfunction or pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 is suppressed in TFEB-/- cells. Interestingly, the Rag GTPase complex, which senses lysosomal amino acids and activates mTORC1, is both necessary and sufficient to regulate starvation- and stress-induced nuclear translocation of TFEB. These data indicate that the lysosome senses its content and regulates its own biogenesis by a lysosome-to-nucleus signalling mechanism that involves TFEB and mTOR.",

        "Title": "Cross-talk between insulin and Wnt signaling in preadipocytes: role of Wnt co-receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-5 (LRP5).",
        "Abstract": "Disturbed Wnt signaling has been implicated in numerous diseases, including type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. In the present study, we have investigated cross-talk between insulin and Wnt signaling pathways using preadipocytes with and without knockdown of the Wnt co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 and with and without knock-out of insulin and IGF-1 receptors. We find that Wnt stimulation leads to phosphorylation of insulin signaling key mediators, including Akt, GSK3\u03b2, and ERK1/2, although with a lower fold stimulation and slower time course than observed for insulin. These Wnt effects are insulin/IGF-1 receptor-dependent and are lost in insulin/IGF-1 receptor double knock-out cells. Conversely, in LRP5 knockdown preadipocytes, insulin-induced phosphorylation of IRS1, Akt, GSK3\u03b2, and ERK1/2 is highly reduced. This effect is specific to insulin, as compared with IGF-1, stimulation and appears to be due to an inducible interaction between LRP5 and the insulin receptor as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. These data demonstrate that Wnt and insulin signaling pathways exhibit cross-talk at multiple levels. Wnt induces phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and GSK3\u03b2, and this is dependent on insulin/IGF-1 receptors. Insulin signaling also involves the Wnt co-receptor LRP5, which has a positive effect on insulin signaling. Thus, altered Wnt and LRP5 activity can serve as modifiers of insulin action and insulin resistance in the pathophysiology of diabetes and metabolic syndrome.",

        "Title": "T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase regulates bone resorption and whole-body insulin sensitivity through its expression in osteoblasts.",
        "Abstract": "Insulin signaling in osteoblasts contributes to whole-body glucose homeostasis in the mouse and in humans by increasing the activity of osteocalcin. The osteoblast insulin signaling cascade is negatively regulated by ESP, a tyrosine phosphatase dephosphorylating the insulin receptor. Esp is one of many tyrosine phosphatases expressed in osteoblasts, and this observation suggests that other protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) may contribute to the attenuation of insulin receptor phosphorylation in this cell type. In this study, we sought to identify an additional PTP(s) that, like ESP, would function in the osteoblast to regulate insulin signaling and thus affect activity of the insulin-sensitizing hormone osteocalcin. For that purpose, we used as criteria expression in osteoblasts, regulation by isoproterenol, and ability to trap the insulin receptor in a substrate-trapping assay. Here we show that the T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP) regulates insulin receptor phosphorylation in the osteoblast, thus compromising bone resorption and bioactivity of osteocalcin. Accordingly, osteoblast-specific deletion of TC-PTP promotes insulin sensitivity in an osteocalcin-dependent manner. This study increases the number of genes involved in the bone regulation of glucose homeostasis.",

The use of mouse genetics has changed this approach and has rejuvenated the concept of a whole-body study of physiology. One physiological system that has been profoundly influenced by mouse genetics is skeletal physiology. Indeed, genetic approaches have identified several unexpected organs that affect bone physiology. These new links have begun to provide a plausible explanation for the evolutionary involvement of hormones such as leptin with bone physiology. These genetic approaches have also revealed bone as a true endocrine organ capable of regulating energy metabolism and reproduction.

        "Abstract": "The sympathetic nervous system suppresses bone mass by mechanisms that remain incompletely elucidated. Using cell-based and murine genetics approaches, we show that this activity of the sympathetic nervous system requires osteopontin (OPN), a cytokine and one of the major members of the noncollagenous extracellular matrix proteins of bone. In this work, we found that the stimulation of the sympathetic tone by isoproterenol increased the level of OPN expression in the plasma and bone and that mice lacking OPN (OPN-KO) suppressed the isoproterenol-induced bone loss by preventing reduced osteoblastic and enhanced osteoclastic activities. In addition, we found that OPN is necessary for changes in the expression of genes related to bone resorption and bone formation that are induced by activation of the sympathetic tone. At the cellular level, we showed that intracellular OPN modulated the capacity of the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor to generate cAMP with a corresponding modulation of cAMP-response element binding (CREB) phosphorylation and associated transcriptional events inside the cell. Our results indicate that OPN plays a critical role in sympathetic tone regulation of bone mass and that this OPN regulation is taking place through modulation of the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor/cAMP signaling system.",

        "Abstract": "Usually vertebrate physiology is studied within the confined limits of a given organ, if not cell type. This approach has progressively changed with the emergence of mouse genetics that has rejuvenated the concept of a whole body study of physiology. A vivid example of how mouse genetics has profoundly affected our understanding of physiology is skeleton physiology. A genetic approach to bone physiology revealed that bone via osteocalcin, an osteoblast-secreted molecule, is a true endocrine organ regulating energy metabolism and male reproduction. This ongoing body of work that takes bone out of its traditional roles is connecting it to a growing number of peripheral organs. These novel important hormonal connections between bone, energy metabolism and reproduction underscore the concept of functional dependence in physiology and the importance of genetic approaches to identify novel endocrine regulations.",

First, it provides a molecular explanation for 2 human genetic diseases-osteoporosis, pseudoglioma, and high bone mass syndrome; second, it suggests a novel and anabolic way to treat osteoporosis.

        "Abstract": "In a proof-of-concept study it was shown that decreasing synthesis of gut serotonin through a small molecule inhibitor of Tph1 could prevent and treat ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in young mice and rats. In this study, we define the minimal efficacy of this Tph1 inhibitor, demonstrate that its activity is improved with the duration of treatment, and show that its anabolic effect persists on interruption. Importantly, given the prevalence of osteoporosis in the aging population, we then show that Tph1 inhibition rescues ovariectomy-induced bone loss in aged mice. It also cures the low bone mass of Lrp5-deficient mice through a sole anabolic effect. Lastly, we provide evidence that inhibition of gut serotonin synthesis can work in concert with an antiresorptive agent to increase bone mass in ovariectomized mice. This study provides a more comprehensive view of the anabolic efficacy of Tph1 inhibitors and further establishes the spectrum of their therapeutic potential in the treatment of bone-loss disorders.",

Historically, the hypothalamus has been viewed as the site for leptin signaling in the brain. Recent genetic studies, however, indicate that these physiological functions, notably the regulation of appetite and bone mass accrual by leptin, take place for the most part through inhibition of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) synthesis and release by brainstem neurons. Here, we review how these findings have redefined the roadmap of leptin signaling in the brain. This has led to proof-of-principle studies showing that selective inhibition of the leptin-serotonin axis is a viable therapeutic approach to treat appetite disorders.",

        "Abstract": "The uncarboxylated form of the osteoblast-specific secreted molecule osteocalcin is a hormone favoring glucose handling and increasing energy expenditure. As a result, the absence of osteocalcin leads to glucose intolerance in mice, while genetically modified mice with an increase in uncarboxylated osteocalcin are protected from type 2 diabetes and obesity. Here, we tested in the mouse the therapeutic potential of intermittent administration of osteocalcin. We found that daily injections of osteocalcin at either 3 or 30 ng/g/day significantly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in mice fed a normal diet. This was attributable, in part, to an increase in both \u03b2-cell mass and insulin secretion. When mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD), daily injections of osteocalcin partially restored insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Moreover, mice treated with intermittent osteocalcin injections displayed additional mitochondria in their skeletal muscle, had increased energy expenditure and were protected from diet-induced obesity. Finally, the hepatic steatosis induced by the HFD was completely rescued in mice receiving osteocalcin daily. Overall, these results provide evidence that daily injections of osteocalcin can improve glucose handling and prevent the development of type 2 diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "The sympathetic nervous system, whose activity is regulated by leptin signaling in the brain, is a major regulator of bone mass accrual. To determine the identity of the cell type in which the sympathetic tone signals to inhibit bone mass accrual, we performed a systematic, cell-specific analysis of the function of the \u03b22 adrenergic receptor (Adr\u03b22) and various genes implicated in the pathway in the mouse. This was followed by leptin intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion and bone histomorphometric analyses of bone parameters. We show that the sympathetic tone signals in the osteoblasts to inhibit CREB (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein) phosphorylation and thus decrease osteoblast proliferation and to promote ATF4 phosphorylation and thus increase RANKL (receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand) expression, which then stimulates osteoclast differentiation. Leptin ICV infusion in various mouse models established that leptin-dependent inhibition of bone mass accrual relies on both transcriptional events taking place in osteoblasts. Thus, this study formally identifies the osteoblast as the major cell type in which the molecular events triggered by the sympathetic regulation of bone mass accrual take place. As such, it suggests that inhibiting sympathetic signaling could be beneficial in the treatment of low bone mass conditions.",

        "Title": "The osteoblast: an insulin target cell controlling glucose homeostasis.",
        "Abstract": "The past five years have witnessed the emergence and discovery of unexpected functions played by the skeleton in whole-organism physiology. Among these newly described tasks is the role of bone in the control of energy metabolism, which is achieved through the secretion of osteocalcin, an osteoblasts-derived hormone regulating insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, and energy expenditure. These initial findings raised several fundamental questions on the nature of insulin action in bone. Discoveries made independently by our two groups have provided answers recently to some of these questions. Through the analysis of mice lacking insulin receptor (InsR) only in osteoblasts, we found that insulin signaling in these cells favors whole-body glucose homeostasis. Importantly, this function of insulin signaling in osteoblasts was achieved through the negative regulation of osteocalcin carboxylation and bioavailability. Our studies also established that insulin signaling in osteoblasts was a positive regulator not only of postnatal bone acquisition but also of bone resorption. Interestingly, it appears that insulin signaling in osteoblasts induced osteocalcin activation by stimulating osteoclast activity. Indeed, the low pH generated during bone resorption is a sufficient means to decarboxylate osteocalcin. Our findings establish that the osteoblast is an important target used by insulin to control whole-body glucose homeostasis and identify bone resorption as the mechanism regulating osteocalcin activation.",

        "Abstract": "Interactions between bone and the reproductive system have until now been thought to be limited to the regulation of bone remodeling by the gonads. We now show that, in males, bone acts as a regulator of fertility. Using coculture assays, we demonstrate that osteoblasts are able to induce testosterone production by the testes, though they fail to influence estrogen production by the ovaries. Analyses of cell-specific loss- and gain-of-function models reveal that the osteoblast-derived hormone osteocalcin performs this endocrine function. By binding to a G protein-coupled receptor expressed in the Leydig cells of the testes, osteocalcin regulates in a CREB-dependent manner the expression of enzymes that is required for testosterone synthesis, promoting germ cell survival. This study expands the physiological repertoire of osteocalcin and provides the first evidence that the skeleton is an endocrine regulator of reproduction.",

        "Abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that leptin regulates appetite and energy expenditure, at least in part by inhibiting serotonin synthesis and release from brainstem neurons. To demonstrate that this pathway works postnatally, we used a conditional, brainstem-specific mouse CreER(T2) driver to show that leptin signals in brainstem neurons after birth to decrease appetite by inhibiting serotonin synthesis. Cell-specific gene deletion experiments and intracerebroventricular leptin infusions reveal that serotonin signals in arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus through the Htr1a receptor to favor food intake and that this serotonin function requires the expression of Creb, which regulates the expression of several genes affecting appetite. Accordingly, a specific antagonist of the Htr1a receptor decreases food intake in leptin-deficient but not in Htr1a(-/-) mice. Collectively, these results establish that leptin inhibition of serotonin is necessary to inhibit appetite postnatally and provide a proof of principle that selective inhibition of this pathway may be a viable option to treat appetite disorders.",

The existence of this coordinated regulation is motivated by the energetic needs of the skeleton; therefore, this regulation relies on hormones that appear during evolution with the skeleton, not with energy metabolism. Leptin is such a hormone, and it is a critical regulator of bone mass as well as of appetite and energy expenditure. This review goes over the anatomical route and molecular pathways used by leptin to inhibit both bone mass accrual and appetite through its signaling in the brain.",

        "Title": "CREB mediates brain serotonin regulation of bone mass through its expression in ventromedial hypothalamic neurons.",
        "Abstract": "Serotonin is a bioamine regulating bone mass accrual differently depending on its site of synthesis. It decreases accrual when synthesized in the gut, and increases it when synthesized in the brain. The signal transduction events elicited by gut-derived serotonin once it binds to the Htr1b receptor present on osteoblasts have been identified and culminate in cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) regulation of osteoblast proliferation. In contrast, we do not know how brain-derived serotonin favors bone mass accrual following its binding to the Htr2c receptor on neurons of the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus (VMH). We show here--through gene expression analysis, serotonin treatment of wild-type and Htr2c(-/-) hypothalamic explants, and cell-specific gene deletion in the mouse--that, following its binding to the Htr2c receptor on VMH neurons, serotonin uses a calmodulin kinase (CaMK)-dependent signaling cascade involving CaMKK\u03b2 and CaMKIV to decrease the sympathetic tone and increase bone mass accrual. We further show that the transcriptional mediator of these events is CREB, whose phosphorylation on Ser 133 is increased by CaMKIV following serotonin treatment of hypothalamic explants. A microarray experiment identified two genes necessary for optimum sympathetic activity whose expression is regulated by CREB. These results provide a molecular understanding of how serotonin signals in hypothalamic neurons to regulate bone mass accrual and identify CREB as a critical determinant of this function, although through different mechanisms depending on the cell type, neuron, or osteoblast in which it is expressed.",

        "Abstract": "The serotonin molecule has some remarkable properties. It is synthesized by two different genes at two different sites, and, surprisingly, plays antagonistic functions on bone mass accrual at these two sites. When produced peripherally, serotonin acts as a hormone to inhibit bone formation. In contrast, when produced in the brain, serotonin acts as a neurotransmitter to exert a positive and dominant effect on bone mass accrual by enhancing bone formation and limiting bone resorption. The effect of serotonin on bone biology could be harnessed pharmacologically to treat diseases such as osteoporosis.",

        "Abstract": "Extracellular regulation of signaling by transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 family members is emerging as a key aspect of organ formation and tissue remodeling. In this study, we demonstrate that fibrillin-1 and -2, the structural components of extracellular microfibrils, differentially regulate TGF-\u03b2 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) bioavailability in bone. Fibrillin-2-null (Fbn2(-/-)) mice display a low bone mass phenotype that is associated with reduced bone formation in vivo and impaired osteoblast maturation in vitro. This Fbn2(-/-) phenotype is accounted for by improper activation of latent TGF-\u03b2 that selectively blunts expression of osterix, the transcriptional regulator of osteoblast maturation, and collagen I, the structural template for bone mineralization. Cultured osteoblasts from Fbn1(-/-) mice exhibit improper latent TGF-\u03b2 activation as well, but mature faster because of increased availability of otherwise matrix-bound BMPs. Additional in vitro evidence excludes a direct role of microfibrils in supporting mineral deposition. Together, these findings identify the extracellular microfibrils as critical regulators of bone formation through the modulation of endogenous TGF-\u03b2 and BMP signaling.",

        "Abstract": "During the last 20 years, the emergence of sophisticated genetic tools has extraordinarily improved our understanding of a large number of physiological functions, among which the physiology of the skeleton. Bone, recently described as an endocrine organ, has the ability to constantly renew itself through bone remodeling, which requires a constant supply of energy. Hence, we hypothesized that there must be a coregulation of bone mass and energy metabolism, and focused on leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, which regulates both energy metabolism and bone remodeling through a central relay. Through a careful analysis of leptin neuronal targets, we unraveled that leptin regulation of bone mass occurs indirectly by inhibiting serotonin release and synthesis in neurons of the brainstem. Surprisingly, we observed that the other pool of serotonin, produced in enterochromaffin cells of the duodenum, negatively regulates bone mass accrual. Thus, serotonin is a molecule with two distinct functional identities depending on its site of synthesis. Finally, a recent study provides a proof of principle that inhibiting gut-derived serotonin (GDS) biosynthesis could become a new anabolic treatment for osteoporosis. double dagger.",

        "Abstract": "The broad expression of the insulin receptor suggests that the spectrum of insulin function has not been fully described. A cell type expressing this receptor is the osteoblast, a bone-specific cell favoring glucose metabolism through a hormone, osteocalcin, that becomes active once uncarboxylated. We show here that insulin signaling in osteoblasts is necessary for whole-body glucose homeostasis because it increases osteocalcin activity. To achieve this function insulin signaling in osteoblasts takes advantage of the regulation of osteoclastic bone resorption exerted by osteoblasts. Indeed, since bone resorption occurs at a pH acidic enough to decarboxylate proteins, osteoclasts determine the carboxylation status and function of osteocalcin. Accordingly, increasing or decreasing insulin signaling in osteoblasts promotes or hampers glucose metabolism in a bone resorption-dependent manner in mice and humans. Hence, in a feed-forward loop, insulin signals in osteoblasts activate a hormone, osteocalcin, that promotes glucose metabolism.",

In mice and humans, osteocalcin can be present in the serum in carboxylated or undercarboxylated forms and it has been shown that it is the undercarboxylated form of osteocalcin which acts as a hormone. The study of osteocalcin different circulating forms in mouse serum, however, has been hampered by the absence of quantitative methodology. Here we described a triple enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system for quantification of mouse total, carboxylated and uncarboxylated osteocalcin. That carboxylation of osteocalcin was decreased in mouse osteoblasts cultures treated with warfarin, an inhibitor of carboxylation validated this assay. This ELISA could also detect elevated levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin in the serum of mice treated with warfarin and in the serum of Esp -/- mice, a mouse model known to have more undercarboxylated, i.e., active osteocalcin. These results show that this new ELISA system is a reliable method to assess carboxylation status of osteocalcin in cell culture supernatants as well as in mouse serum. Its use should facilitate the analysis of culture system or mouse model in which the hormonal activity of osteocalcin needs to be evaluated.",

It has been demonstrated recently to achieve this function by hampering the synthesis of gut-derived serotonin, which is a powerful inhibitor of bone formation. In this study we analyzed plasma serotonin levels in patients with a high-bone-mass (HBM) phenotype owing to gain-of-function mutation of Lrp5 (T253I). A total of 9 HBM patients were compared with 18 sex- and age-matched controls. In HBM patients, the serotonin concentrations in platelet-poor plasma were significantly lower than in the controls (mean +/- SEM: 2.16 +/- 0.28 ng/mL versus 3.51 +/- 0.49 ng/mL, respectively, p < .05). Our data support the hypothesis that circulating serotonin levels mediate the increased bone mass resulting from gain-of-function mutations in Lrp5 in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Bone remodeling is regulated by various neuronal inputs, including sympathetic tone, which is known to inhibit bone mass accrual. This aspect of sympathetic nervous system function raises the prospect that the other arm of the autonomic nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system, may also affect bone remodeling. Here, we use various mutant mouse strains, each lacking one of the muscarinic receptors that mediate parasympathetic activity, to show that the parasympathetic nervous system acting through the M(3) muscarinic receptor is a positive regulator of bone mass accrual, increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption. Gene expression studies, cell-specific gene deletion experiments, and analysis of compound mutant mice showed that the parasympathetic nervous system favors bone mass accrual by acting centrally and by decreasing the sympathetic tone. By showing that both arms of the autonomic nervous system affect bone remodeling, this study further underscores the importance of neuronal regulation of bone.",

        "Abstract": "The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin inhibits appetite and bone mass accrual. To fulfill these two functions leptin requires the integrity of hypothalamic neurons but not the expression of its receptor, ObRb on these neurons. These results suggested that leptin acts first elsewhere in the brain to mediate these functions. However, this neuroanatomical site of leptin action in the brain remained elusive. Recent mouse genetic, electrophysiological and neuroanatomical studies provide evidence that leptin inhibits appetite and bone mass accrual through a two-step pathway: it decreases synthesis and the release by brainstem neurons of serotonin that in turn targets hypothalamic neurons to regulate appetite and bone mass accrual.",

        "Abstract": "Osteoporosis is a disease of low bone mass most often caused by an increase in bone resorption that is not sufficiently compensated for by a corresponding increase in bone formation. As gut-derived serotonin (GDS) inhibits bone formation, we asked whether hampering its biosynthesis could treat osteoporosis through an anabolic mechanism (that is, by increasing bone formation). We synthesized and used LP533401, a small molecule inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (Tph-1), the initial enzyme in GDS biosynthesis. Oral administration of this small molecule once daily for up to six weeks acts prophylactically or therapeutically, in a dose-dependent manner, to treat osteoporosis in ovariectomized rodents because of an isolated increase in bone formation. These results provide a proof of principle that inhibiting GDS biosynthesis could become a new anabolic treatment for osteoporosis.",

        "Abstract": "Osteoblasts have recently been found to play a role in regulating glucose metabolism through secretion of osteocalcin. It is unknown, however, how this osteoblast function is regulated transcriptionally. As FoxO1 is a forkhead family transcription factor known to regulate several key aspects of glucose homeostasis, we investigated whether its expression in osteoblasts may contribute to its metabolic functions. Here we show that mice lacking Foxo1 only in osteoblasts had increased pancreatic beta cell proliferation, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity. The ability of osteoblast-specific FoxO1 deficiency to affect metabolic homeostasis was due to increased osteocalcin expression and decreased expression of Esp, a gene that encodes a protein responsible for decreasing the bioactivity of osteocalcin. These results indicate that FoxO1 expression in osteoblasts contributes to FoxO1 control of glucose homeostasis and identify FoxO1 as a key modulator of the ability of the skeleton to function as an endocrine organ regulating glucose metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "Parathyroid hormone (PTH) plays an essential role in regulating calcium and bone homeostasis in the adult, but whether PTH is required at all for regulating fetal-placental mineral homeostasis and skeletal development is uncertain. We hypothesized that despite its low circulating levels during fetal life, PTH plays a critical role in regulating these processes. To address this, we examined two different genetic models of PTH deficiency. Pth null mice have enlarged parathyroids that are incapable of making PTH, whereas Gcm2 null mice lack parathyroids but have PTH that arises from the thymus. Pth nulls served as a model of complete absence of PTH, whereas Gcm2 nulls were a model of severe hypoparathyroidism. We determined that PTH contributes importantly to fetal mineral homeostasis because in its absence a fetal hypoparathyroid phenotype results with hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperphosphatemia, low amniotic fluid mineral content, and reduced skeletal mineral content. We also determined that PTH is expressed in the placenta, regulates the placental expression of genes involved in calcium and other solute transfer, and may directly stimulate placental calcium transfer. Although parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) acts in concert with PTH to regulate fetal mineral homeostasis and placental calcium transfer, unlike PTH, it does not upregulate in response to fetal hypocalcemia.",

        "Abstract": "Our work focuses on genetic and molecular mechanisms for the reciprocal regulation of bone and energy metabolism orchestrated by leptin and osteocalcin. In the context of this reciprocal regulation, the finding that leptin inhibits insulin secretion by beta cells while osteocalcin favors it is surprising. In exploring the molecular bases of this paradox we found that leptin, as is the case for most of its functions, uses a neuronal relay to inhibit insulin secretion. Cell-specific gene-deletion experiments revealed that a component of this neuronal regulation is the sympathetic innervation to osteoblasts. Under the control of leptin the sympathetic tone favors expression in osteoblasts of Esp, which inhibits the metabolic activity of osteocalcin. We further identify ATF4 as a transcription factor that regulates Esp expression and thereby insulin secretion and sensitivity. Taken together these data illustrate the tight connections between bone remodeling and energy metabolism and add further credence to the notion that the osteoblast is a bona fide endocrine cell type.",

        "Abstract": "Leptin inhibition of bone mass accrual requires the integrity of specific hypothalamic neurons but not expression of its receptor on these neurons. The same is true for its regulation of appetite and energy expenditure. This suggests that leptin acts elsewhere in the brain to achieve these three functions. We show here that brainstem-derived serotonin (BDS) favors bone mass accrual following its binding to Htr2c receptors on ventromedial hypothalamic neurons and appetite via Htr1a and 2b receptors on arcuate neurons. Leptin inhibits these functions and increases energy expenditure because it reduces serotonin synthesis and firing of serotonergic neurons. Accordingly, while abrogating BDS synthesis corrects the bone, appetite and energy expenditure phenotypes caused by leptin deficiency, inactivation of the leptin receptor in serotonergic neurons recapitulates them fully. This study modifies the map of leptin signaling in the brain and identifies a molecular basis for the common regulation of bone and energy metabolisms.

        "Title": "The transcription factor ATF4 regulates glucose metabolism in mice through its expression in osteoblasts.",
        "Abstract": "The recent demonstration that osteoblasts have a role in controlling energy metabolism suggests that they express cell-specific regulatory genes involved in this process. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a transcription factor that accumulates predominantly in osteoblasts, where it regulates virtually all functions linked to the maintenance of bone mass. Since Atf4-/- mice have smaller fat pads than littermate controls, we investigated whether ATF4 also influences energy metabolism. Here, we have shown, through analysis of Atf4-/- mice, that ATF4 inhibits insulin secretion and decreases insulin sensitivity in liver, fat, and muscle. Several lines of evidence indicated that this function of ATF4 occurred through its osteoblastic expression. First, insulin sensitivity is enhanced in the liver of Atf4-/- mice, but not in cultured hepatocytes from these mice. Second, mice overexpressing ATF4 in osteoblasts only [termed here alpha1(I)Collagen-Atf4 mice] displayed a decrease in insulin secretion and were insulin insensitive. Third, the alpha1(I)Collagen-Atf4 transgene corrected the energy metabolism phenotype of Atf4-/- mice. Fourth, and more definitely, mice lacking ATF4 only in osteoblasts presented the same metabolic abnormalities as Atf4-/- mice. Molecularly, ATF4 favored expression in osteoblasts of Esp, which encodes a product that decreases the bioactivity of osteocalcin, an osteoblast-specific secreted molecule that enhances secretion of and sensitivity to insulin. These results provide a transcriptional basis to the observation that osteoblasts fulfill endocrine functions and identify ATF4 as a regulator of most functions of osteoblasts.",

        "Abstract": "Thanks to integrative physiology, new relationships between organs and homeostatic functions have emerged. This approach to physiology based on a whole organism approach has allowed the bone field to make fundamental progress. In the last decade, clinical observations and scientific evidences in vivo have uncovered that fat with leptin controls bone mass through brain including a hypothalamic relay and sympathetic nervous system. The finding that energy metabolism affects bone remodelling suggested that in an endocrine perspective, a feedback loop should exist. Beside its classical functions, bone can now be considered as a true endocrine organ secreting osteocalcin, a hormone pharmacologically active on glucose and fat metabolism. Indeed osteocalcin stimulates insulin secretion and beta-cell proliferation. Simultaneously, osteocalcin acts on adipocytes to induce Adiponectin which secondarily reduce insulin resistance. This cross regulation between bone and energy metabolism offers novel therapeutic targets in type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis.",

These include t(4;14) multiple myeloma associated with ectopic expression of FGFR3 and t(4;12)(p16;p13) acute myeloid leukemia associated with expression of a constitutively activated fusion tyrosine kinase, TEL-FGFR3. We recently reported that FGFR3 directly tyrosine phosphorylates RSK2 at Y529, which consequently regulates RSK2 activation. Here we identified Y707 as an additional tyrosine in RSK2 that is phosphorylated by FGFR3. Phosphorylation at Y707 contributes to RSK2 activation, through a putative disruption of the autoinhibitory alphaL-helix on the C terminus of RSK2, unlike Y529 phosphorylation, which facilitates ERK binding. Moreover, we found that FGFR3 interacts with RSK2 through residue W332 in the linker region of RSK2 and that this association is required for FGFR3-dependent phosphorylation of RSK2 at Y529 and Y707, as well as the subsequent RSK2 activation. Furthermore, in a murine bone marrow transplant assay, genetic deficiency in RSK2 resulted in a significantly delayed and attenuated myeloproliferative syndrome induced by TEL-FGFR3 as compared with wild-type cells, suggesting a critical role of RSK2 in FGFR3-induced hematopoietic transformation. Our current and previous findings represent a paradigm for tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent regulation of serine-threonine kinases.",

        "Abstract": "The osteoblast-secreted molecule osteocalcin favors insulin secretion, but how this function is regulated in vivo by extracellular signals is for now unknown. In this study, we show that leptin, which instead inhibits insulin secretion, partly uses the sympathetic nervous system to fulfill this function. Remarkably, for our purpose, an osteoblast-specific ablation of sympathetic signaling results in a leptin-dependent hyperinsulinemia. In osteoblasts, sympathetic tone stimulates expression of Esp, a gene inhibiting the activity of osteocalcin, which is an insulin secretagogue. Accordingly, Esp inactivation doubles hyperinsulinemia and delays glucose intolerance in ob/ob mice, whereas Osteocalcin inactivation halves their hyperinsulinemia. By showing that leptin inhibits insulin secretion by decreasing osteocalcin bioactivity, this study illustrates the importance of the relationship existing between fat and skeleton for the regulation of glucose homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "The leptin regulation of bone remodeling, which has been documented through studies of loss-of-function mutations of this hormone or of its receptor in mice and humans, still raised several unanswered questions. For instance, it has been assumed but not formally demonstrated that this regulation occurs through neuronal means. Likewise, it has not been possible until now to dissociate the influence leptin exerts on appetite and energy expenditure from this function. We show here through mouse genetic studies that a deletion of the leptin receptor in neurons results in an increase in bone formation and bone resorption, resulting in a high bone mass as seen in leptin-deficient mice. In contrast, the same deletion in osteoblasts only does not influence bone remodeling. Furthermore, through the use of l/l mice, a model of gain of function in leptin signaling harboring a Y985L substitution in the leptin receptor, we show that leptin signaling inhibits bone mass accrual by up-regulating sympathetic activity independently of any change in appetite or energy expenditure. This work establishes that in vivo leptin regulates bone mass accrual by acting through neuronal means and provides a direct demonstration that this function of leptin can occur independently of its regulation of energy metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "Loss- and gain-of-function mutations in the broadly expressed gene Lrp5 affect bone formation, causing osteoporosis and high bone mass, respectively. Although Lrp5 is viewed as a Wnt coreceptor, osteoblast-specific disruption of beta-Catenin does not affect bone formation. Instead, we show here that Lrp5 inhibits expression of Tph1, the rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme for serotonin in enterochromaffin cells of the duodenum. Accordingly, decreasing serotonin blood levels normalizes bone formation and bone mass in Lrp5-deficient mice, and gut- but not osteoblast-specific Lrp5 inactivation decreases bone formation in a beta-Catenin-independent manner. Moreover, gut-specific activation of Lrp5, or inactivation of Tph1, increases bone mass and prevents ovariectomy-induced bone loss. Serotonin acts on osteoblasts through the Htr1b receptor and CREB to inhibit their proliferation. By identifying duodenum-derived serotonin as a hormone inhibiting bone formation in an Lrp5-dependent manner, this study broadens our understanding of bone remodeling and suggests potential therapies to increase bone mass.",

Accordingly, lysosomal dysfunctions are often associated with impaired autophagy. We demonstrated that inactivation of the sulfatase modifying factor 1 gene (Sumf1), a gene mutated in multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD), causes glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) to accumulate in lysosomes, which in turn disrupts autophagy. We utilized a murine model of MSD to study how impairment of this process affects chondrocyte viability and thus skeletal development.",

        "Abstract": "Cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) contains large amounts of proteoglycans made of a protein core decorated by highly sulfated sugar chains, the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs desulfation, a necessary step for their degradation, is exerted by sulfatases that are activated by another enzyme, Sulfatase-Modifying Factor 1 (SUMF1), whose inactivation in humans leads to severe skeletal abnormalities. We show here that despite being expressed in both osteoblasts and chondrocytes Sumf1 does not affect osteoblast differentiation. Conversely, in chondrocytes it favors ECM production and autophagy and promotes proliferation and differentiation by limiting FGF signaling. Thus, proteoglycan desulfation is a critical regulator of chondrogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is one of the two known mediators of the leptin regulation of bone mass. Cart is expressed in both the brain and peripheral tissues such as the pituitary gland and the pancreatic islets. Cart(-/-) mice present a low bone mass phenotype due to an isolated increase in osteoclast number. In an effort to rescue their bone phenotype, we delivered recombinant CART in the third ventricle of the mutant mice but never recorded any improvement of the low bone mass, although this procedure could affect fat pad mass. In contrast, transgenic mice harboring a 2-fold increase in CART circulating level display a high bone mass due to an isolated decrease in osteoclast number and could rescue the low bone mass phenotype of the Cart(-/-) mice. Thus, our results suggest that in its capacity of a regulator of bone remodeling, CART may act more as a circulating molecule than a neuropeptide.",

        "Abstract": "The osteoblast-specific secreted molecule osteocalcin behaves as a hormone regulating glucose metabolism and fat mass in two mutant mouse strains. Here, we ask two questions: is the action of osteocalcin on beta cells and adipocytes elicited by the same concentrations of the molecule, and more importantly, does osteocalcin regulate energy metabolism in WT mice? Cell-based assays using isolated pancreatic islets, a beta cell line, and primary adipocytes showed that picomolar amounts of osteocalcin are sufficient to regulate the expression of the insulin genes and beta cell proliferation markers, whereas nanomolar amounts affect adiponectin and Pgc1alpha expression in white and brown adipocytes, respectively. In vivo the same difference exists in osteocalcin's ability to regulate glucose metabolism on the one hand and affect insulin sensitivity and fat mass on the other hand. Furthermore, we show that long-term treatment of WT mice with osteocalcin can significantly weaken the deleterious effect on body mass and glucose metabolism of gold thioglucose-induced hyperphagia and high-fat diet. These results establish in WT mice the importance of this novel molecular player in the regulation of glucose metabolism and fat mass and suggest that osteocalcin may be of value in the treatment of metabolic diseases.",

        "Abstract": "The regulation of bone remodeling by an adipocyte-derived hormone implies that bone may exert a feedback control of energy homeostasis. To test this hypothesis we looked for genes expressed in osteoblasts, encoding signaling molecules and affecting energy metabolism. We show here that mice lacking the protein tyrosine phosphatase OST-PTP are hypoglycemic and are protected from obesity and glucose intolerance because of an increase in beta-cell proliferation, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity. In contrast, mice lacking the osteoblast-secreted molecule osteocalcin display decreased beta-cell proliferation, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. Removing one Osteocalcin allele from OST-PTP-deficient mice corrects their metabolic phenotype. Ex vivo, osteocalcin can stimulate CyclinD1 and Insulin expression in beta-cells and Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, in adipocytes; in vivo osteocalcin can improve glucose tolerance. By revealing that the skeleton exerts an endocrine regulation of sugar homeostasis this study expands the biological importance of this organ and our understanding of energy metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "FILAMIN B, which encodes a cytoplasmic actin binding protein, is mutated in several skeletal dysplasias. To further investigate how an actin binding protein influences skeletogenesis, we generated mice lacking intact Filamin B. As observed in spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome patients, Filamin B mutant mice display ectopic mineralization in many cartilaginous elements. This aberrant mineralization is due to ectopic chondrocyte hypertrophy similar to that seen in mice expressing Runx2 in chondrocytes. Accordingly, removing one copy of Runx2 rescues the Filamin B mutant phenotype, indicating that Filamin B is a regulator of Runx2 function during chondrocyte differentiation. Filamin B binds Smad3, which is known to interact with Runx2. Smad3 phosphorylation is increased in the mutant mice. Thus, Filamin B inhibits Runx2 activity, at least in part, through the Smad3 pathway. Our results uncover the involvement of actin binding proteins during chondrogenesis and provide a molecular basis to a human genetic disease.",

        "Abstract": "Bone remodeling requires osteoblasts and osteoclasts working in concert to maintain a constant bone mass. The dysregulation of signaling pathways that affect osteoblast or osteoclast differentiation or function leads to either osteopenia or high bone mass. The discovery that activating and inactivating mutations in low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5, a putative Wnt coreceptor, led to high bone mass and low bone mass in human beings, respectively, generated a tremendous amount of interest in the possible role of the Wnt signaling pathway in the regulation of bone remodeling. A number of mouse models have been generated to study a collection of Wnt signaling molecules that have been identified as regulators of bone mass. These mouse models help establish the canonical Wnt signaling pathway as a major regulator of chondrogenesis, osteoblastogenesis, and osteoclastogenesis. This review will summarize these advances.",

To examine its pathogenic role in vivo, we generated transgenic mice that overexpressed GGT in a tissue-specific manner utilizing the Cre-loxP recombination system. Systemic as well as local production of GGT accelerated osteoclast development and bone resorption in vivo by increasing the sensitivity of bone marrow macrophages to receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand, an essential cytokine for osteoclastogenesis. Mutated GGT devoid of enzyme activity was as potent as the wild-type molecule in inducing osteoclast formation, suggesting that GGT acts not as an enzyme but as a cytokine. Recombinant GGT protein increased receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand expression in marrow stromal cells and also stimulated osteoclastogenesis from bone marrow macrophages at lower concentrations. Thus, GGT is implicated as being involved in diseases characterized by accelerated osteoclast development and bone destruction and provides a new target for therapeutic intervention.",

        "Abstract": "Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a potent inhibitor of soft tissue calcification, and Mgp gene deletion in mice results in arterial calcification. Our aim was to examine osteopontin (OPN) expression and localization, and posttranslational processing of OPN by the crosslinking enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2), in the calcified aorta of Mgp-deficient (Mgp(-/-)) mice. Using immunohistochemistry and light and electron microscopy, we report that following mineralization occurring in the arterial media of Mgp(-/-) aortas, OPN is upregulated and accumulates at the surface of the calcified elastic lamellae. Macrophages were observed in direct contact with this OPN-rich layer. Western blot analysis of extracted Mgp(-/-) aortas revealed that the majority of the OPN was in high molecular mass protein complexes, indicating modification by a crosslinking enzyme. Consistent with this observation, TG2 expression and gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysyl crosslink levels were also increased in Mgp(-/-) aortas. In addition to the mineral-inhibiting actions of OPN, and based on data linking OPN and TG2 with cell adhesion in various cell types including monocytes and macrophages, we propose that TG2 interactions with OPN lead to protein polymerization that facilitates macrophage adhesion to the calcified elastic lamellae to promote clearance of the ectopic mineral deposits.",

Here, we show that in contrast, RSK2 activity, ATF4-dependent collagen synthesis, and bone formation are increased in mice lacking neurofibromin in osteoblasts (Nf1(ob)(-/-) mice). Independently of RSK2, ATF4 phosphorylation by PKA is enhanced in Nf1(ob)(-/-) mice, thereby increasing Rankl expression, osteoclast differentiation, and bone resorption. In agreement with ATF4 function in amino acid transport, a low-protein diet decreased bone protein synthesis and normalized bone formation and bone mass in Nf1(ob)(-/-) mice without affecting other organ weight, while a high-protein diet overcame Atf4(-/-) and Rsk2(-/-) mice developmental defects, perinatal lethality, and low bone mass. By showing that ATF4-dependent skeletal dysplasiae are treatable by dietary manipulations, this study reveals a molecular connection between nutrition and skeletal development.",

        "Abstract": "The observation that obesity protects from osteoporosis suggested that energy metabolism and bone mass could be regulated by the same hormones. Testing this hypothesis revealed that leptin regulates bone mass through a hypothalamic relay and using two neural mediators, the sympathetic tone and CART, both acting on one cell type the osteoblast. This review summarizes the genetic and molecular bases of this regulation and discusses its potential clinical implications.",

        "Abstract": "The perichondrium, a structure made of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells surrounding growth plate cartilage, regulates chondrocyte maturation through poorly understood mechanisms. Analyses of loss- and gain-of-function models show that Twist-1, whose expression in cartilage is restricted to perichondrium, favors chondrocyte maturation in a Runx2-dependent manner. Runx2, in turn, enhances perichondrial expression of Fgf18, a regulator of chondrocyte maturation. Accordingly, compound heterozygous embryos for Runx2 and Fgf18 deletion display the same chondrocyte maturation phenotype as Fgf18-null embryos. This study identifies a transcriptional basis for the inhibition of chondrocyte maturation by perichondrium and reveals that Runx2 fulfills antagonistic functions during chondrogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Collagen V is a quantitatively minor component of collagen I fibrils and the defective product of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). To provide new insights into its embryonic function, a continuous evaluation of the expression pattern of proalpha1(V), a chain common to all collagen V molecular forms, was performed by in situ hybridization of developing mouse from 7.5 days after conception (dpc) to birth. Proalpha1(V) transcripts were first detected at 8.5 dpc, signals being considerably augmented at 16.5 dpc and declining at birth. Hybridization signals were, at first, exclusively detected in the dorsal aorta wall, heart, and adnexa. At 10.5 dpc, col5a1 expression was found in the heart, dorsal aorta wall, branchial arches, mesonephrotic tubules, and intestinal mesenchyme and coincided with proalpha1(I) developmental expression. Later stages exhibited an intense signal in more restricted regions, notably the skin, the bones and vertebral column, the cornea, the tendons and ligaments, the peritoneal membranes, the umbilical cord, and the salivary gland. The data revealed the important contribution of collagen V to the development of functional connective tissues. Proalpha1(V) signals were exclusively detected in the flattened cells of the surface ectoderm at 10.5 dpc. By 12.5 dpc, when cells had become cuboidal, the signal switched to the dermal fibroblasts. Thus, type V collagen appears to contribute to epidermis differentiation. Our data also suggest that collagen V participates in bone formation and/or mineralization and in the renewal of stromal cells in the cornea. The results underscore the role of collagen V in developing embryos and provide important clues for analyzing the phenotype of mouse models for EDS.",

        "Abstract": "Mice with circadian gene Period and Cryptochrome mutations develop high bone mass early in life. Such a phenotype is accompanied by an increase in osteoblast numbers in mutant bone and cannot be corrected by leptin intracerebroventricular infusion. Thus, the molecular clock plays a key role in leptin-mediated sympathetic regulation of bone formation. Indeed, we found that leptin-dependent sympathetic signaling induces the expression of AP1 and circadian genes in bone and in osteoblasts with similar kinetics, and these two pathways play opposite roles in controlling c-myc expression. Mutations in the Period 1 and 2 genes result in uncontrolled c-myc signaling, overexpression of G1 cyclins, and increased osteoblast proliferation and bone-formation parameters. These results indicate that the role of leptin-dependent sympathetic signaling in bone formation is achieved through regulating two antagonistic pathways in osteoblasts.",

Here we show that Tcf1 and Tcf4 are expressed in osteoblasts during development and after birth; stabilization of beta-catenin, an essential component of canonical Wnt signaling, in differentiated osteoblasts results in high bone mass while its deletion from differentiated osteoblasts leads to osteopenia. Histological analysis showed that these mutations affect bone resorption. Cellular and molecular studies showed that beta-catenin together with TCF proteins regulates in osteoblasts the expression of Osteoprotegerin, a major inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation. These findings demonstrate that, in differentiated osteoblasts, beta-catenin and presumably Wnt signaling are negative regulators of osteoclast differentiation; thus they broaden our knowledge about functions that Wnt proteins may have at various stages of skeletogenesis.",

Genetics play a major role in determining peak bone mass and fracture risk, but few genes have been demonstrated conclusively to be involved, much less the signaling pathways with which they are affiliated. The identification of mutations in the gene Lrp5, a Wnt coreceptor, as the cause for both osteoporotic and high-bone mass disorders implicated the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in bone mass regulation. Since Lrp5, other Wnt components have been identified as being regulators of bone mass, and Wnt target genes affecting bone homeostasis have begun to be elucidated. This chapter looks at the various components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and the data indicating that this pathway plays a major role in the control of both bone formation and bone resorption, the two key aspects of bone remodeling.",

        "Abstract": "Vertebrate skeletogenesis involves two processes, skeletal patterning and osteoblast differentiation. Here, we show that Satb2, encoding a nuclear matrix protein, is expressed in branchial arches and in cells of the osteoblast lineage. Satb2-/- mice exhibit both craniofacial abnormalities that resemble those observed in humans carrying a translocation in SATB2 and defects in osteoblast differentiation and function. Multiple osteoblast-specific genes were identified as targets positively regulated by SATB2. In addition, SATB2 was found to repress the expression of several Hox genes including Hoxa2, an inhibitor of bone formation and regulator of branchial arch patterning. Molecular analysis revealed that SATB2 directly interacts with and enhances the activity of both Runx2 and ATF4, transcription factors that regulate osteoblast differentiation. This synergy was genetically confirmed by bone formation defects in Satb2/Runx2 and Satb2/Atf4 double heterozygous mice. Thus, SATB2 acts as a molecular node in a transcriptional network regulating skeletal development and osteoblast differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "Development and repair of the vertebrate skeleton requires the precise coordination of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. In diseases such as osteoporosis, bone resorption dominates over bone formation, suggesting a failure to harmonize osteoclast and osteoblast function. Here, we show that mice expressing a constitutively nuclear NFATc1 variant (NFATc1(nuc)) in osteoblasts develop high bone mass. NFATc1(nuc) mice have massive osteoblast overgrowth, enhanced osteoblast proliferation, and coordinated changes in the expression of Wnt signaling components. In contrast, viable NFATc1-deficient mice have defects in skull bone formation in addition to impaired osteoclast development. NFATc1(nuc) mice have increased osteoclastogenesis despite normal levels of RANKL and OPG, indicating that an additional NFAT-regulated mechanism influences osteoclastogenesis in vivo. Calcineurin/NFATc signaling in osteoblasts controls the expression of chemoattractants that attract monocytic osteoclast precursors, thereby coupling bone formation and bone resorption. Our results indicate that NFATc1 regulates bone mass by functioning in both osteoblasts and osteoclasts.",

        "Title": "Cart overexpression is the only identifiable cause of high bone mass in melanocortin 4 receptor deficiency.",
        "Abstract": "The neural regulation of bone remodeling has proven to be increasingly complex at the molecular level because it involves both positive and negative mediators of bone formation and resorption. One of the mediators expressed in hypothalamic neurons that leptin uses to inhibit osteoclast differentiation and thereby bone resorption is cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). CART expression in the hypothalamus is increased in mice lacking melanocortin 4 receptor (Mc4r(-/-) mice). Moreover, we show here that humans or mice lacking only one allele of Mc4r display a decrease in bone resorption parameters, high bone mass, and an increase in CART serum levels and/or hypothalamic expression. To demonstrate that the Cart overexpression is the only identifiable cause for the high bone mass observed upon Mc4r inactivation, we removed one allele of Cart from mice either heterozygous or homozygous for Mc4r inactivation. This manipulation sufficed to either significantly improve or normalize bone resorption parameters, without improving the energy metabolism disturbance that characterizes Mc4r-deficient mice. These results identify CART signaling as the main if not only molecular pathway accounting for the decrease in bone resorption leading to high bone mass in mice and humans deficient in Mc4r. As importantly, they also indicate that CART regulates bone resorption independently of the role it may exert in energy metabolism, suggesting that the neural control of appetite and bone remodeling are independent of each other.",

        "Abstract": "The transcription factor, Runx2, promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy, whereas parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) delays this process. To examine whether PTHrP suppresses chondrocyte hypertrophy via Runx2-dependent or -independent pathways, Runx2 expression and chondrocyte differentiation were analyzed using bones from embryonic limbs of wild type and Runx2(-/-) mice. Treatment of cultured rudiments with PTH dramatically suppresses Runx2 mRNA levels in hypertrophic chondrocytes. PTH-induced delay of chondrocyte hypertrophy was observed in cultured tibiae from both Runx2(-/-) and wild-type embryos. This delay was also seen after PTH administration to limbs from wild type and Runx2(-/-) mice expressing Runx2 in chondrocytes via a collagen 2 promoter-driven transgene. To further explore Runx2-dependent and -independent effects of PTHrP, we examined embryonic tibiae and femurs from littermates null for PTHrP, Runx2, or both genes. Runx2(-/-) femurs exhibited no vascular invasion or chondrocytes expressing collagen type X or osteopontin mRNA. In contrast, Runx2(-/-)/PTHrP(-/-) mice exhibited limited vascular invasion and some chondrocytes expressing collagen X or osteopontin mRNA. In both tibia and femur, Runx2(-/-)/PTHrP(-/-) mice exhibited expanded regions of proliferating chondrocytes when compared to the same regions in PTHrP(-/-) mice. These data indicate that the delayed hypertrophy induced by PTHrP is mediated by both Runx2-dependent and -independent mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "p53 is a well known tumor suppressor. We show that p53 also regulates osteoblast differentiation, bone formation, and osteoblast-dependent osteoclast differentiation. Indeed, p53(-/-) mice display a high bone mass phenotype, and p53(-/-) osteoblasts show accelerated differentiation, secondary to an increase in expression of the osteoblast differentiation factor osterix, as a result. Reporter assays indicate that p53 represses osterix transcription by the minimal promoter in a DNA-binding-independent manner. In addition, p53(-/-) osteoblasts have an enhanced ability to favor osteoclast differentiation, in association with an increase in expression of macrophage-colony stimulating factor, which is under the control of osterix. Furthermore, inactivating p53 is sufficient to rescue the osteoblast differentiation defects observed in mice lacking c-Abl, a p53-interacting protein. Thus, these results identify p53 as a novel regulator of osteoblast differentiation, osteoblast-dependent osteoclastogenesis, and bone remodeling.",

        "Abstract": "Macrophages have a critical role in inflammatory and immune responses through their ability to recognize and engulf apoptotic cells. Here we show that macrophages initiate a cell-death programme in target cells by activating the canonical WNT pathway. We show in mice that macrophage WNT7b is a short-range paracrine signal required for WNT-pathway responses and programmed cell death in the vascular endothelial cells of the temporary hyaloid vessels of the developing eye. These findings indicate that macrophages can use WNT ligands to influence cell-fate decisions--including cell death--in adjacent cells, and raise the possibility that they do so in many different cellular contexts.",

        "Abstract": "The hormone leptin is a regulator of bone remodeling, a homeostatic function maintaining bone mass constant. Mice lacking molecular-clock components (Per and Cry), or lacking Per genes in osteoblasts, display high bone mass, suggesting that bone remodeling may also be subject to circadian regulation. Moreover, Per-deficient mice experience a paradoxical increase in bone mass following leptin intracerebroventricular infusion. Thus, clock genes may mediate the leptin-dependent sympathetic regulation of bone formation. We show that expression of clock genes in osteoblasts is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system and leptin. Clock genes mediate the antiproliferative function of sympathetic signaling by inhibiting G1 cyclin expression. Partially antagonizing this inhibitory loop, leptin also upregulates AP-1 gene expression, which promotes cyclin D1 expression, osteoblast proliferation, and bone formation. Thus, leptin determines the extent of bone formation by modulating, via sympathetic signaling, osteoblast proliferation through two antagonistic pathways, one of which involves the molecular clock.",

        "Title": "Cooperative interactions between activating transcription factor 4 and Runx2/Cbfa1 stimulate osteoblast-specific osteocalcin gene expression.",
        "Abstract": "The role of ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4) in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation was recently described using ATF4-deficient mice (Yang, X., Matsuda, K., Bialek, P., Jacquot, S., Masuoka, H. C., Schinke, T., Li, L., Brancorsini, S., Sassone-Corsi, P., Townes, T. M., Hanauer, A., and Karsenty, G. (2004) Cell 117, 387-398). However, the mechanisms of ATF4 in bone cells are still not clear. In this study, we determined the molecular mechanisms through which ATF4 activates the mouse osteocalcin (Ocn) gene 2 (mOG2) expression and mOG2 promoter activity. ATF4 increased the levels of Ocn mRNA and mOG2 promoter activity in Runx2-containing osteoblasts but not in non-osteoblastic cells that lack detectable Runx2 protein. However, ATF4 increased Ocn mRNA and mOG2 promoter activity in non-osteoblastic cells when Runx2 was co-expressed. Mutational analysis of the OSE1 (ATF4-binding site) and the two OSE2s (Runx2-binding sites) in the 657-bp mOG2 promoter demonstrated that ATF4 and Runx2 activate Ocn via cooperative interactions with these sites. Pull-down assays using nuclear extracts from osteoblasts or COS-7 cells overexpressing ATF4 and Runx2 showed that both factors are present in either anti-ATF4 and anti-Runx2 immunoprecipitates. In contrast, pull-down assays using purified glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were unable to demonstrate a direct physical interaction between ATF4 and Runx2. Thus, accessory factors are likely involved in stabilizing interactions between these two molecules. Regions within Runx2 required for ATF4 complex formation and activation were identified. Deletion analysis showed that the leucine zipper domain of ATF4 is critical for Runx2 activation. This study is the first demonstration that cooperative interactions between ATF4 and Runx2/Cbfa1 stimulate osteoblast-specific Ocn expression and suggests that this regulation may represent a novel intramolecular mechanism regulating Runx2 activity and, thereby, osteoblast differentiation and bone formation.",

        "Title": "Unloading induces osteoblastic cell suppression and osteoclastic cell activation to lead to bone loss via sympathetic nervous system.",
        "Abstract": "Osteoporosis is one of the major health problems in our modern world. Especially, disuse (unloading) osteoporosis occurs commonly in bedridden patients, a population that is rapidly increasing due to aging-associated diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying such unloading-induced pathological bone loss have not yet been fully understood. Since sympathetic nervous system could control bone mass, we examined whether unloading-induced bone loss is controlled by sympathetic nervous tone. Treatment with beta-blocker, propranolol, suppressed the unloading-induced reduction in bone mass. Conversely, beta-agonist, isoproterenol, reduced bone mass in loaded mice, and under such conditions, unloading no longer further reduced bone mass. Analyses on the cellular bases indicated that unloading-induced reduction in the levels of osteoblastic cell activities, including mineral apposition rate, mineralizing surface, and bone formation rate, was suppressed by propranolol treatment and that isoproterenol-induced reduction in these levels of bone formation parameters was no longer suppressed by unloading. Unloading-induced reduction in the levels of mineralized nodule formation in bone marrow cell cultures was suppressed by propranolol treatment in vivo. In addition, loss of a half-dosage in the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene suppressed the unloading-induced bone loss and reduction in mineralized nodule formation. Unloading-induced increase in the levels of osteoclastic activities such as osteoclast number and surface as well as urinary deoxypyridinoline was all suppressed by the treatment with propranolol. These observations indicated that sympathetic nervous tone mediates unloading-induced bone loss through suppression of bone formation by osteoblasts and enhancement of resorption by osteoclasts.",

        "Title": "Canonical Wnt signaling in differentiated osteoblasts controls osteoclast differentiation.",
        "Abstract": "Inactivation of beta-catenin in mesenchymal progenitors prevents osteoblast differentiation; inactivation of Lrp5, a gene encoding a likely Wnt coreceptor, results in low bone mass (osteopenia) by decreasing bone formation. These observations indicate that Wnt signaling controls osteoblast differentiation and suggest that it may regulate bone formation in differentiated osteoblasts. Here, we study later events and find that stabilization of beta-catenin in differentiated osteoblasts results in high bone mass, while its deletion from differentiated osteoblasts leads to osteopenia. Surprisingly, histological analysis showed that these mutations primarily affect bone resorption rather than bone formation. Cellular and molecular studies showed that beta-catenin together with TCF proteins regulates osteoblast expression of Osteoprotegerin, a major inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation. These findings demonstrate that beta-catenin, and presumably Wnt signaling, promote the ability of differentiated osteoblasts to inhibit osteoclast differentiation; thus, they broaden our knowledge of the functions Wnt proteins have at various stages of skeletogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) mineralization is a physiological process in bone and a pathological one in soft tissues. The mechanisms determining the spatial restriction of ECM mineralization to bone physiologically are poorly understood. Here we show that a normal extracellular phosphate concentration is required for bone mineralization, while lowering this concentration prevents mineralization of any ECM. However, simply raising extracellular phosphate concentration is not sufficient to induce pathological mineralization, this is because of the presence in all ECMs of pyrophosphate, an inhibitor of mineralization. ECM mineralization occurs only in bone because of the exclusive coexpression in osteoblasts of Type I collagen and Tnap, an enzyme that cleaves pyrophosphate. This dual requirement explains why Tnap ectopic expression in cells producing fibrillar collagen is sufficient to induce pathological mineralization. This study reveals that coexpression in osteoblasts of otherwise broadly expressed genes is necessary and sufficient to induce bone mineralization and provides evidence that pathological mineralization can be prevented by modulating extracellular phosphate concentration.",

        "Abstract": "The G-protein alpha-subunit G(s)alpha is required for the intracellular cAMP responses to hormones and other agonists. G(s)alpha is known to mediate the cAMP response to parathyroid hormone and other hormones and cytokines in bone and cartilage. To analyze the in vivo role of G(s)alpha signaling in osteoblasts, we developed mice with osteoblast/osteocyte-specific G(s)alpha deficiency (BGsKO) by mating G(s)alpha-floxed mice with collagen Ialpha1 promoter-Cre recombinase transgenic mice. Early skeletal development was normal in BGsKO mice, because formation of the initial cartilage template and bone collar was unaffected. The chondrocytic zones of the growth plates also appeared normal in BGsKO mice. BGsKO mice had a defect in the formation of the primary spongiosa with reduced immature osteoid (new bone formation) and overall length, which led to reduced trabecular bone volume. In contrast, cortical bone was thickened with narrowing of the bone marrow cavity. This was probably due to decreased cortical bone resorption, because osteoclasts were markedly reduced on the endosteal surface of cortical bone. In addition, the expression of alkaline phosphatase, an early osteoblastic differentiation marker, was normal, whereas the expression of the late osteoblast differentiation markers osteopontin and osteocalcin was reduced, suggesting that the number of mature osteoblasts in bone is reduced. Expression of the osteoclast-stimulating factor receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand was also reduced. Overall, our findings have similarities to parathyroid hormone null mice and confirm that the differential effects of parathyroid hormone on trabecular and cortical bone are primarily mediated via G(s)alpha in osteoblasts. Osteoblast-specific G(s)alpha deficiency leads to reduced bone turnover.",

        "Abstract": "Human aging is characterized by debilitating diseases, including heart failure, cardiac pacemaker defects, muscle wasting, and osteoporosis, in heart, skeletal muscle, and bone. Recent studies are identifying pathways for these aging-related diseases by examining how the process of aging influences tissue-specific progenitors and differentiated cell lineages in these organ systems. These advances form a foundation for new therapeutic strategies to delay the onset of aging-related disorders.",

        "Title": "Leptin regulation of bone resorption by the sympathetic nervous system and CART.",
        "Abstract": "Bone remodelling, the mechanism by which vertebrates regulate bone mass, comprises two phases, namely resorption by osteoclasts and formation by osteoblasts; osteoblasts are multifunctional cells also controlling osteoclast differentiation. Sympathetic signalling via beta2-adrenergic receptors (Adrb2) present on osteoblasts controls bone formation downstream of leptin. Here we show, by analysing Adrb2-deficient mice, that the sympathetic nervous system favours bone resorption by increasing expression in osteoblast progenitor cells of the osteoclast differentiation factor Rankl. This sympathetic function requires phosphorylation (by protein kinase A) of ATF4, a cell-specific CREB-related transcription factor essential for osteoblast differentiation and function. That bone resorption cannot increase in gonadectomized Adrb2-deficient mice highlights the biological importance of this regulation, but also contrasts sharply with the increase in bone resorption characterizing another hypogonadic mouse with low sympathetic tone, the ob/ob mouse. This discrepancy is explained, in part, by the fact that CART ('cocaine amphetamine regulated transcript'), a neuropeptide whose expression is controlled by leptin and nearly abolished in ob/ob mice, inhibits bone resorption by modulating Rankl expression. Our study establishes that leptin-regulated neural pathways control both aspects of bone remodelling, and demonstrates that integrity of sympathetic signalling is necessary for the increase in bone resorption caused by gonadal failure.",

We describe a two-component conditional ablation technology using a mouse carrying an X-linked puDeltatk transgene, which is only activated in cells expressing Cre. Ablation of the Cre-expressing cells can be temporally regulated by the time of ganciclovir (GCV) administration. This strategy was demonstrated using a Col2Cre transgenic line. Differentiating chondrocytes in bigenic animals could be ablated at different developmental stages resulting in disorganized growth plates and dwarfism. Macrocephaly, macroglossia and umbilical hernia were also observed in ablated 18.5 dpc embryos. Crosses between the puDeltatk selector transgenic line and existing cre lines will facilitate numerous temporally regulated tissue-specific ablation experiments.",

        "Abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modulate cell growth and differentiation by governing chromatin structure and repressing the activity of specific transcription factors. We showed previously that HDAC9 acts as a negative regulator of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and skeletal muscle differentiation. Here we report that HDAC4, which is expressed in prehypertrophic chondrocytes, regulates chondrocyte hypertrophy and endochondral bone formation by interacting with and inhibiting the activity of Runx2, a transcription factor necessary for chondrocyte hypertrophy. HDAC4-null mice display premature ossification of developing bones due to ectopic and early onset chondrocyte hypertrophy, mimicking the phenotype that results from constitutive Runx2 expression in chondrocytes. Conversely, overexpression of HDAC4 in proliferating chondrocytes in vivo inhibits chondrocyte hypertrophy and differentiation, mimicking a Runx2 loss-of-function phenotype. These results establish HDAC4 as a central regulator of chondrocyte hypertrophy and skeletogenesis and suggest general roles for class II HDACs in the control of cellular hypertrophy.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie regulation of transcription of the human osteopontin encoding gene (OPN) may help to clarify several processes, such as fibrotic evolution of organ damage, tumorigenesis and metastasis, and immune response, in which OPN overexpression is observed. With the aim to evaluate variants with functional effect on transcription, we have analyzed the promoter region and focused our investigation on three common variants present in the first 500 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Transfection of constructs carrying the four most frequent haplotypes relative to variants at -66, -156, and -443 fused to the luciferase reporter gene in a panel of different cell lines showed that one haplotype conferred a significantly reduced level of reporter gene expression in all tested cell lines. We describe that the -66 polymorphism modifies the binding affinity for the SP1/SP3 transcription factors, the -156 polymorphism is included in a yet uncharacterized RUNX2 binding site, and the -443 polymorphism causes differential binding of an unknown factor. The finding of differential effects of various combination of variants in haplotypes may contribute to explain data of association studies reported in several already published articles. Future association studies using haplotypes instead of single OPN variants will allow to achieve more accurate results referable to differential expression of OPN in several common diseases, in which OPN is considered a candidate susceptibility gene.",

        "Abstract": "Based on the analysis of a loss-of-function model, we recently showed that ATF4 regulates osteoblast terminal differentiation and function and is implicated in the pathophysiology of Coffin-Lowry syndrome. That study, however, did not address whether forced expression of Atf4 in non-osteoblastic cells would lead to osteoblast-specific gene expression, one of the most important features of a cell differentiation factor. To address this question we searched for cell lines that would not express Atf4. Contrasting with the restricted pattern of its protein accumulation, Atf4 mRNA was found in all cell lines and mouse tissues tested. Treatment of non-osteoblastic cells with MG115, a proteasome inhibitor, induced ATF4 accumulation and resulted in activation of an Osteocalcin promoter luciferase construct as well as expression of endogenous Osteocalcin, a molecular marker of differentiated osteoblasts and a target gene of ATF4. Eliminating the expression of beta-TrCP1, an ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase interacting with ATF4 by RNA interference, led to ATF4 accumulation and to endogenous Osteocalcin expression in fibroblasts. These results indicate that the absence of ATF4 in most cell types is determined, at least in part, by an ubiquitination-dependent process. To our knowledge ATF4 is the first cell-specific transcription factor in which cell-specific distribution is achieved post-translationally. This study also establishes that ATF4, like other osteoblast differentiation factors, such as Runx2 and Osterix, has the ability to induce osteoblast-specific gene expression in non-osteoblastic cells.",

        "Abstract": "The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) controls adipogenesis and metabolism. We demonstrate here that the absence of PPARgamma in fat has potent osteogenic activities, which affect haematopoiesis. The congenital absence of PPARgamma in fat of lipodystrophic PPARgamma(hyp/hyp) mice, strongly enhanced bone mass and consequentially reduced the bone-marrow cavity. Consistent with this, PPARgamma(hyp/hyp) mice had a significant decrease in bone marrow cellularity and resorted to extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen to maintain haematopoiesis. Our data indicate that antagonizing PPARgamma activity in fat could be an effective way to combat osteoporosis and suggest that haematopoietic function should be scrutinized in lipodystrophic subjects.",

        "Abstract": "Extracellular matrix mineralization (ECMM) is a physiologic process in the skeleton and in teeth and a pathologic one in other organs. The molecular mechanisms controlling ECMM are poorly understood. Inactivation of Matrix gla protein (Mgp) revealed that MGP is an inhibitor of ECMM. The fact that MGP is present in the general circulation raises the question of whether ECMM is regulated locally and/or systemically. Here, we show that restoration of Mgp expression in arteries rescues the arterial mineralization phenotype of Mgp-/- mice, whereas its expression in osteoblasts prevents bone mineralization. In contrast, raising the serum level of MGP does not affect mineralization of any ECM. In vivo mutagenesis experiments show that the anti-ECMM function of MGP requires four amino acids which are gamma-carboxylated (gla residues). Surprisingly, another gla protein specific to bone and teeth (osteocalcin) does not display the anti-ECMM function of MGP. These results indicate that ECMM is regulated locally in animals and uncover a striking disparity of function between proteins sharing identical structural motifs.",

        "Abstract": "Runx2-Cbfa1, a Runt transcription factor, plays important roles during skeletal development. It is required for differentiation and function of osteoblasts. In its absence, chondrocyte hypertrophy is severely impaired and there is no vascularization of cartilage templates during skeletal development. These tissue-specific functions of Runx2 are likely to be dependent on its interaction with other proteins. We have therefore searched for proteins that may modulate the activity of Runx2. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify a groucho homologue, Grg5, as a Runx2-interacting protein. Grg5 enhances Runx2 activity in a cell culture-based assay and by analyses of postnatal growth in mice we demonstrate that Grg5 and Runx2 interact genetically. We also show that Runx2 haploinsufficiency in the absence of Grg5 results in a more severe delay in ossification of cranial sutures and fontanels than occurs with Runx2 haploinsufficiency on a wild-type background. Finally, we find shortening of the proliferative and hypertrophic zones, and expansion of the resting zone in the growth plates of Runx2(+/-) Grg5(-/-) mice that are associated with reduced Ihh expression and Indian hedgehog (Ihh) signaling. We therefore conclude that Grg5 enhances Runx2 activity in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Coffin-Lowry Syndrome (CLS) is an X-linked mental retardation condition associated with skeletal abnormalities. The gene mutated in CLS, RSK2, encodes a growth factor-regulated kinase. However, the cellular and molecular bases of the skeletal abnormalities associated with CLS remain unknown. Here, we show that RSK2 is required for osteoblast differentiation and function. We identify the transcription factor ATF4 as a critical substrate of RSK2 that is required for the timely onset of osteoblast differentiation, for terminal differentiation of osteoblasts, and for osteoblast-specific gene expression. Additionally, RSK2 and ATF4 posttranscriptionally regulate the synthesis of Type I collagen, the main constituent of the bone matrix. Accordingly, Atf4-deficiency results in delayed bone formation during embryonic development and low bone mass throughout postnatal life. These findings identify ATF4 as a critical regulator of osteoblast differentiation and function, and indicate that lack of ATF4 phosphorylation by RSK2 may contribute to the skeletal phenotype of CLS.",

        "Abstract": "Runx2 is necessary and sufficient for osteoblast differentiation, yet its expression precedes the appearance of osteoblasts by 4 days. Here we show that Twist proteins transiently inhibit Runx2 function during skeletogenesis. Twist-1 and -2 are expressed in Runx2-expressing cells throughout the skeleton early during development, and osteoblast-specific gene expression occurs only after their expression decreases. Double heterozygotes for Twist-1 and Runx2 deletion have none of the skull abnormalities observed in Runx2(+/-) mice, a Twist-2 null background rescues the clavicle phenotype of Runx2(+/-) mice, and Twist-1 or -2 deficiency leads to premature osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, Twist-1 overexpression inhibits osteoblast differentiation without affecting Runx2 expression. Twist proteins' antiosteogenic function is mediated by a novel domain, the Twist box, which interacts with the Runx2 DNA binding domain to inhibit its function. In vivo mutagenesis confirms the antiosteogenic function of the Twist box. Thus, relief of inhibition by Twist proteins is a mandatory event precluding osteoblast differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "Amylin is a member of the calcitonin family of hormones cosecreted with insulin by pancreatic beta cells. Cell culture assays suggest that amylin could affect bone formation and bone resorption, this latter function after its binding to the calcitonin receptor (CALCR). Here we show that Amylin inactivation leads to a low bone mass due to an increase in bone resorption, whereas bone formation is unaffected. In vitro, amylin inhibits fusion of mononucleated osteoclast precursors into multinucleated osteoclasts in an ERK1/2-dependent manner. Although Amylin +/- mice like Amylin-deficient mice display a low bone mass phenotype and increased bone resorption, Calcr +/- mice display a high bone mass due to an increase in bone formation. Moreover, compound heterozygote mice for Calcr and Amylin inactivation displayed bone abnormalities observed in both Calcr +/- and Amylin +/- mice, thereby ruling out that amylin uses CALCR to inhibit osteoclastogenesis in vivo. Thus, amylin is a physiological regulator of bone resorption that acts through an unidentified receptor.",

        "Abstract": "STAT3 is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is indispensable during early embryogenesis. To study the functions of STAT3 postnatally, we generated conditional STAT3-deficient mice. To that end, STAT3(lox/lox) mice were crossed with mice expressing Cre under the control of rat insulin II gene promoter (RIP-Cre mice). Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses showed that STAT3 is deleted from beta cells in the islets of Langerhans. Genomic DNA PCR revealed that STAT3 deletion also occurred in the hypothalamus. Hypothalamic Cre expression was further confirmed by crossing RIP-Cre/STAT3(lox/lox) mice with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain and staining for lacZ activity. Double immunohistochemical staining confirmed that deletion of STAT3 occurred in leptin receptor (OB-Rb isoform)-positive neurons. RIP-Cre/STAT3(lox/lox) mice are mildly hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic at the time of weaning, become hyperphagic immediately after weaning, and exhibit impaired glucose tolerance. Body weight, body fat, and mRNA and protein levels of leptin are all significantly increased in RIP-Cre/STAT3(lox/lox) mice. Administration of recombinant leptin by intracerebroventricular infusion failed to cause complete loss of body fat in RIP-Cre/STAT3(lox/lox) mice. Transplantation of wild-type islets into RIP-Cre/STAT3(lox/lox) mice also failed to decrease adiposity or to correct other abnormalities in these mice. These data thus suggest that loss of STAT3 in the hypothalamus caused by RIP-Cre action likely interferes with normal body weight homeostasis and glucose metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "Using chemical lesioning we previously identified hypothalamic neurons that are required for leptin antiosteogenic function. In the course of these studies we observed that destruction of neurons sensitive to monosodium glutamate (MSG) in arcuate nuclei did not affect bone mass. However MSG treatment leads to hypogonadism, a condition inducing bone loss. Therefore the normal bone mass of MSG-treated mice suggested that MSG-sensitive neurons may be implicated in the control of bone mass. To test this hypothesis we assessed bone resorption and bone formation parameters in MSG-treated mice. We show here that MSG-treated mice display the expected increase in bone resorption and that their normal bone mass is due to a concomitant increase in bone formation. Correction of MSG-induced hypogonadism by physiological doses of estradiol corrected the abnormal bone resorptive activity in MSG-treated mice and uncovered their high bone mass phenotype. Because neuropeptide Y (NPY) is highly expressed in MSG-sensitive neurons we tested whether NPY regulates bone formation. Surprisingly, NPY-deficient mice had a normal bone mass. This study reveals that distinct populations of hypothalamic neurons are involved in the control of bone mass and demonstrates that MSG-sensitive neurons control bone formation in a leptin-independent manner. It also indicates that NPY deficiency does not affect bone mass.",

        "Title": "Stat1 functions as a cytoplasmic attenuator of Runx2 in the transcriptional program of osteoblast differentiation.",
        "Abstract": "Bone remodeling is central to maintaining the integrity of the skeletal system, wherein the developed bone is constantly renewed by the balanced action of osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic bone resorption. In the present study, we demonstrate a novel function of the Stat1 transcription factor in the regulation of bone remodeling. In the bone of the Stat1-deficient mice, excessive osteoclastogenesis is observed, presumably caused by a loss of negative regulation of osteoclast differentiation by interferon (IFN)-beta. However, the bone mass is unexpectedly increased in these mice. This increase is caused by excessive osteoblast differentiation, wherein Stat1 function is independent of IFN signaling. Actually, Stat1 interacts with Runx2 in its latent form in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting the nuclear localization of Runx2, an essential transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation. The new function of Stat1 does not require the Tyr 701 that is phosphorylated when Stat1 becomes a transcriptional activator. Our study provides a unique example in which a latent transcription factor attenuates the activity of another transcription factor in the cytoplasm, and reveals a new regulatory mechanism in bone remodeling.",

We previously reported that coculturing MDA PCa 2b prostate cancer cells with primary mouse osteoblasts (PMOs) induced PMO proliferation and differentiation. An osteoblastic reaction was also observed in vivo after injection of MDA PCa 2b cells into the bones of severe combined immunodeficient disease mice. The aim of this study was to identify the sequence of events that leads to these osteoblastic lesions in vivo and, using this in vitro model, to define the contributions of various genes and cellular pathways in the pathophysiology of osteoblastic bone metastases of prostate cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation requires their attachment to the collagen type II-rich matrix of developing bone. This interaction is mediated by integrins and their cytoplasmic effectors, such as the integrin-linked kinase (ILK). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms whereby integrins control these processes, we have specifically inactivated the ILK gene in growth plate chondrocytes using the Cre-lox methodology. Mice carrying an ILK allele flanked by loxP sites (ILK-fl) were crossed to transgenic mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the collagen type II promoter. Inactivation of both copies of the ILK-fl allele lead to a chondrodysplasia characterized by a disorganized growth plate and to dwarfism. Expression of chondrocyte differentiation markers such as collagen type II, collagen type X, Indian hedgehog and the PTH-PTHrP receptor was normal in ILK-deficient growth plates. In contrast, chondrocyte proliferation, assessed by BrdU or proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling, was markedly reduced in the mutant growth plates. Cell-based assays showed that integrin-mediated adhesion of primary cultures of chondrocytes from mutant animals to collagen type II was impaired. ILK inactivation in chondrocytes resulted in reduced cyclin D1 expression, and this most likely explains the defect in chondrocyte proliferation observed when ILK is inactivated in growth plate cells.",

        "Abstract": "Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is a widely distributed ectopeptidase responsible for the degradation of glutathione in the gamma-glutamyl cycle. This cycle is implicated in the metabolism of cysteine, and absence of GGT causes a severe intracellular decrease in this amino acid. GGT-deficient (GGT-/-) mice have multiple metabolic abnormalities and are dwarf. We show here that this latter phenotype is due to a decreased of the growth plate cartilage total height resulting from a proliferative defect of chondrocytes. In addition, analysis of vertebrae and tibiae of GGT-/- mice revealed a severe osteopenia. Histomorphometric studies showed that this low bone mass phenotype results from an increased osteoclast number and activity as well as from a marked decrease in osteoblast activity. Interestingly, neither osteoblasts, osteoclasts, nor chondrocytes express GGT, suggesting that the observed defects are secondary to other abnormalities. N-acetylcysteine supplementation has been shown to reverse the metabolic abnormalities of the GGT-/- mice and in particular to restore the level of IGF-1 and sex steroids in these mice. Consistent with these previous observations, N-acetylcysteine treatment of GGT-/- mice ameliorates their skeletal abnormalities by normalizing chondrocytes proliferation and osteoblastic function. In contrast, resorbtion parameters are only partially normalized in GGT-/- N-acetylcysteine-treated mice, suggesting that GGT regulates osteoclast biology at least partly independently of these hormones. These results establish the importance of cysteine metabolism for the regulation of bone remodeling and longitudinal growth.",

        "Abstract": "Bone mass is maintained constant between puberty and menopause by the balance between osteoblast and osteoclast activity. The existence of a hormonal control of osteoblast activity has been speculated for years by analogy to osteoclast biology. Through the search for such humoral signal(s) regulating bone formation, leptin has been identified as a strong inhibitor of bone formation. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular infusion of leptin has shown that the effect of this adipocyte-derived hormone on bone is mediated via a brain relay. Subsequent studies have led to the identification of hypothalamic groups of neurons involved in leptin's antiosteogenic function. In addition, those neurons or neuronal pathways are distinct from neurons responsible for the regulation of energy metabolism. Finally, the peripheral mediator of leptin's antiosteogenic function has been identified as the sympathetic nervous system. Sympathomimetics administered to mice decreased bone formation and bone mass. Conversely, beta-blockers increased bone formation and bone mass and blunted the bone loss induced by ovariectomy.",

        "Abstract": "To understand the role of the calcium-sensing receptor (CasR) in the skeleton, we used a genetic approach to ablate parathyroid glands and remove the confounding effects of elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) in CasR-deficient mice. CasR deficiency was transferred onto the glial cells missing 2-deficient (Gcm2-deficient) background by intercrossing CasR- and Gcm2-deficient mice. Superimposed Gcm2 deficiency rescued the perinatal lethality in CasR-deficient mice in association with ablation of the parathyroid glands and correction of the severe hyperparathyroidism. In addition, the double homozygous CasR- and Gcm2-deficient mice demonstrated healing of the abnormal mineralization of cartilage and bone associated with CasR deficiency, indicating that rickets and osteomalacia in CasR-deficient mice are not due to an independent function of CasR in bone and cartilage but to the effect of severe hyperparathyroidism in the neonate. Analysis of the skeleton of 6-week-old homozygous CasR- and Gcm2-deficient mice also failed to identify any essential, nonredundant role for CasR in regulating chondrogenesis or osteogenesis, but further studies are needed to establish the function of CasR in the skeleton. In contrast, concomitant Gcm2 and CasR deficiency failed to rescue the hypocalciuria in CasR-deficient mice, consistent with direct regulation of urinary calcium excretion by CasR in the kidney. Double Gcm2- and CasR-deficient mice provide an important model for evaluating the extraparathyroid functions of CasR.",

        "Title": "Transcriptional coactivation of bone-specific transcription factor Cbfa1 by TAZ.",
        "Abstract": "Core-binding factor 1 (Cbfa1; also called Runx2) is a transcription factor belonging to the Runt family of transcription factors that binds to an osteoblast-specific cis-acting element (OSE2) activating the expression of osteocalcin, an osteoblast-specific gene. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified a transcriptional coactivator, TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif), that binds to Cbfa1. A functional relationship between Cbfa1 and TAZ is demonstrated by the coimmunoprecipitation of TAZ by Cbfa1 and by the fact that TAZ induces a dose-dependent increase in the activity of osteocalcin promoter-luciferase constructs by Cbfa1. A dominant-negative construct of TAZ in which the coactivation domains have been deleted reduces osteocalcin gene expression down to basal levels. NIH 3T3, MC 3T3, and ROS 17/2.8 cells showed the expected nuclear localization of Cbfa1, whereas TAZ was distributed throughout the cytoplasm with some nuclear localization when transfected with either Cbfa1 or TAZ. Upon cotransfection by both Cbfa1 and TAZ, the transfected TAZ shows predominant nuclear localization. The dominant-negative construct of TAZ shows minimal nuclear localization upon cotransfection with Cbfa1. These data indicate that TAZ is a transcription coactivator for Cbfa1 and may be involved in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "Cbfa1/Runx2 is an essential transcription factor for osteoblast and odontoblast differentiation. Heterogeneous mutations of Cbfa1 gene result in cleidocranial dysplasia, an autosomal dominant syndrome, characterized by abnormal skeletal genesis and dental disorders. Recently three Cbfa1/Runx isoforms (Pebp2 alpha A/type I, til-1/type II, and Osf2/type III) have been identified that differ in their amino-terminal sequences. The precise roles of Cbfa1/Runx2 isoforms in odontoblast development are not known. The purpose of this study was to determine and compare expression patterns of the three Cbfa1/Runx2 isoforms in newborn tooth organs. Toward this aim, we developed three probes: type I and type II, which specifically hybridize with Pebp2 alpha A and til-1, respectively, and type II/III, which hybridizes with osf2 and partially with til-1. In addition, Cbfa1/Runx2 binding sites were identified in the regulatory elements of mouse dentin sialophosphoprotein (mDSPP) gene, which encodes a matrix protein expressed during odontogenesis. In situ hybridization performed with the specific Cbfa1/Runx2 isoform probes demonstrated that all isoforms are expressed in teeth and bone. The type I isoform was expressed at higher levels than isoforms type II and type II/III in developing newborn mouse incisors. Genomic mDSPP clones were isolated and characterized containing approximately 2.6 kb of the promoter region. Computer analysis of the promoter segment and intron 1 revealed a number of potential transcriptional factor binding sites including five Cbfa1/Runx2 binding sites, three in the promoter region and two within intron 1. DNA-protein assay and antibody supershift experiments showed that these binding sites interact with nuclear extracts isolated from the mouse odontoblast cell line MO6-G3. Further characterization of the functional role of Cbfa1/Runx2 in the regulation of the mDSPP gene expression is being investigated.",

        "Abstract": "We previously showed that leptin inhibits bone formation by an undefined mechanism. Here, we show that hypothalamic leptin-dependent antiosteogenic and anorexigenic networks differ, and that the peripheral mediators of leptin antiosteogenic function appear to be neuronal. Neuropeptides mediating leptin anorexigenic function do not affect bone formation. Leptin deficiency results in low sympathetic tone, and genetic or pharmacological ablation of adrenergic signaling leads to a leptin-resistant high bone mass. beta-adrenergic receptors on osteoblasts regulate their proliferation, and a beta-adrenergic agonist decreases bone mass in leptin-deficient and wild-type mice while a beta-adrenergic antagonist increases bone mass in wild-type and ovariectomized mice. None of these manipulations affects body weight. This study demonstrates a leptin-dependent neuronal regulation of bone formation with potential therapeutic implications for osteoporosis.",

        "Abstract": "Functional expression of the transcriptional activator Runx2/Cbfal is essential for osteoblastic differentiation and bone formation and maintenance. Forced expression of Runx2 in nonosteoblastic cells induces expression of osteoblast-specific genes, but the effects of Runx2 overexpression on in vitro matrix mineralization have not been determined. To examine whether exogenous Runx2 expression is sufficient to direct in vitro mineralization, we investigated sustained expression of Runx2 in nonosteoblastic and osteoblast-like cell lines using retroviral gene delivery. As expected, forced expression of Runx2 induced several osteoblast-specific genes in NIH3T3 and C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts and up-regulated expression in MC3T3-E1 immature osteoblast-like cells. However, Runx2 expression enhanced matrix mineralization in a cell-type-dependent manner. NIH3T3 and IMR-90 fibroblasts overexpressing Runx2 did not produce a mineralized matrix, indicating that forced expression of Runx2 in these nonosteogenic cell lines is not sufficient to direct in vitro mineralization. Consistent with the pluripotent nature of the cell line, a fraction (25%) of Runx2-expressing C3H10T1/2 fibroblast cultures produced mineralized nodules in a viral supernatant-dependent manner. Notably, bone sialoprotein (BSP) gene expression was detected at significantly higher levels in mineralizing Runx2-infected C3H10T1/2 cells compared with Runx2-expressing cultures which did not mineralize. Treatment of Runx2-infected C3H10T1/2 cultures with dexamethasone enhanced osteoblastic phenotype expression, inducing low levels of mineralization independent of viral supernatant. Finally, Runx2 overexpression in immature osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells resulted in acceleration and robust up-regulation of matrix mineralization compared with controls. These results suggest that, although functional Runx2 is essential to multiple osteoblast-specific activities, in vitro matrix mineralization requires additional tissue-specific cofactors, which supplement Runx2 activity.",

        "Abstract": "Osteopontin (OPN) is abundantly expressed in human calcified arteries. To examine the role of OPN in vascular calcification, OPN mutant mice were crossed with matrix Gla protein (MGP) mutant mice. Mice deficient in MGP alone (MGP(-/-) OPN(+/+)) showed calcification of their arteries as early as 2 weeks (wk) after birth (0.33 +/- 0.01 mmol/g dry weight), and the expression of OPN in the calcified arteries was greatly up-regulated compared with MGP wild-types. OPN accumulated adjacent to the mineral and colocalized to surrounding cells in the calcified media. Cells synthesizing OPN lacked smooth muscle (SM) lineage markers, SM alpha-actin and SM22alpha. However, most of them were not macrophages. Importantly, mice deficient in both MGP and OPN had twice as much arterial calcification as MGP(-/-) OPN(+/+) at 2 wk, and over 3 times as much at 4 wk, suggesting an inhibitory effect of OPN in vascular calcification. Moreover, these mice died significantly earlier (4.4 +/- 0.2 wk) than MGP(-/-) OPN(+/+) counterparts (6.6 +/- 1.0 wk). The cause of death in these animals was found to be vascular rupture followed by hemorrhage, most likely due to enhanced calcification. These studies are the first to demonstrate a role for OPN as an inducible inhibitor of ectopic calcification in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a member of the vitamin K-dependent gamma carboxylase protein family expressed in cartilage. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1) stimulates chondrocyte differentiation, whereas basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) acts in an opposite manner. We explored the differential expression and regulation by IGF1 and FGF2 of the MGP gene during chondrocyte differentiation. We used a primary culture system of rabbit epiphyseal chondrocytes to show that MGP mRNA is mainly expressed during serum-induced proliferation. Much lower MGP mRNA content is observed in post-mitotic chondrocytes, which newly express alpha 1X procollagen mRNA, a marker of late-differentiated cells. From studies of a series of growth factors, it was shown that IGF1 decreased chondrocyte MGP transcripts, whereas FGF2 had the opposite effect. FGF2 stimulated chondrocyte MGP production in a dose- and time-dependent manner at the mRNA and protein levels. FGF2 acted in a dose- and time-dependent manner, reaching a maximum at 10 ng/ml at 20 h. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not modify FGF2 action, in agreement with a direct effect. Actinomycin D abolished FGF2-induced stimulation, strongly suggesting that FGF2 modulated MGP gene transcription. We transiently transfected chondrocytes with a construct containing the mouse MGP promoter from -5000 to -168 base pairs, relative to the transcription start site of the gene linked to the luciferase gene (MGP-Luc). In transfected cells, FGF2 stimulated luciferase activity up to sevenfold while IGF1 had no effect. Hence, FGF2 induces transcription of the MGP gene via the 5'-flanking region of the gene. Using a series of deleted MGP-Luc constructs, we identified a sequence of 748 base pairs which was sufficient for transcriptional activation by FGF2. These results led us to postulate that the inhibitory chondrogenic action of FGF2 involves a mechanism whereby MGP gene transcription and protein are induced.",

        "Abstract": "The skeleton in vertebrates is composed of bone and cartilage, which contains three specific types: osteoblasts and osteoclasts in bone and chondrocytes in cartilage. Like other cell types in the body, skeletal cell differentiation is controlled by multiple transcription factors at various stages of their development. Cbfa1 and Osx, a newly identified zinc-finger containing protein, are osteoblast-specific transcription factors. Loss of function of either one of them leads to absence of bone in mammals. Here, we discuss transcription factors involved in controlling the differentiation of osteoclasts, such as Pu.1 and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, and chondrocytes, such as Sox proteins. Finally, recent progress in identifying mutations in transcription factors affecting skeletal patterning and development is also described.",

        "Abstract": "Cell- and time-specific gene inactivation should enhance our knowledge of bone biology. Implementation of this technique requires construction of transgenic mouse lines expressing Cre recombinase in osteoblasts, the bone forming cell. We tested several promoter fragments for their ability to drive efficient Cre expression in osteoblasts. In the first mouse transgenic line, the Cre gene was placed under the control of the 2.3-kb proximal fragment of the alpha1(I)-collagen promoter, which is expressed at high levels in osteoblasts throughout their differentiation. Transgenic mice expressing this transgene in bone were bred with the ROSA26 reporter (R26R) strain in which the ROSA26 locus is targeted with a conditional LacZ reporter cassette. In R26R mice, Cre expression and subsequent Cre-mediated recombination lead to expression of the LacZ reporter gene, an event that can be monitored by LacZ staining. LacZ staining was detected in virtually all osteoblasts of alpha1(I)-Cre;R26R mice indicating that homologous recombination occurred in these cells. No other cell type stained blue. In the second line studied, the 1.3-kb fragment of osteocalcin gene 2 (OG2) promoter, which is active in differentiated osteoblasts, was used to drive Cre expression. OG2-Cre mice expressed Cre specifically in bone. However, cross of OG2-Cre mice with R26R mice did not lead to any detectable LacZ staining in osteoblasts. Lastly, we tested a more active artificial promoter derived from the OG2 promoter. The artificial OG2-Cre transgene was expressed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in cartilage and bone samples. After cross of the artificial OG2-Cre mice with R26R mice, we detected a LacZ staining in articular chondrocytes but not in osteoblasts. Our data suggest that the only promoter able to drive Cre expression at a level sufficient to induce recombination in osteoblasts is the alpha1(I)-collagen promoter.",

        "Title": "PTHrP and Indian hedgehog control differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes at multiple steps.",
        "Abstract": "In developing murine growth plates, chondrocytes near the articular surface (periarticular chondrocytes) proliferate, differentiate into flat column-forming proliferating cells (columnar chondrocytes), stop dividing and finally differentiate into hypertrophic cells. Indian hedgehog (Ihh), which is predominantly expressed in prehypertrophic cells, stimulates expression of parathyroid hormone (PTH)-related peptide (PTHrP) which negatively regulates terminal chondrocyte differentiation through the PTH/PTHrP receptor (PPR). However, the roles of PTHrP and Ihh in regulating earlier steps in chondrocyte differentiation are unclear. We present novel mouse models with PPR abnormalities that help clarify these roles. In mice with chondrocyte-specific PPR ablation and mice with reduced PPR expression, chondrocyte differentiation was accelerated not only at the terminal step but also at an earlier step: periarticular to columnar differentiation. In these models, upregulation of Ihh action in the periarticular region was also observed. In the third model in which the PPR was disrupted in about 30% of columnar chondrocytes, Ihh action in the periarticular chondrocytes was upregulated because of ectopically differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes that had lost PPR. Acceleration of periarticular to columnar differentiation was also noted in this mouse, while most of periarticular chondrocytes retained PPR signaling. These data suggest that Ihh positively controls differentiation of periarticular chondrocytes independently of PTHrP. Thus, chondrocyte differentiation is controlled at multiple steps by PTHrP and Ihh through the mutual regulation of their activities.",

        "Abstract": "The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (Lrp)-5 functions as a Wnt coreceptor. Here we show that mice with a targeted disruption of Lrp5 develop a low bone mass phenotype. In vivo and in vitro analyses indicate that this phenotype becomes evident postnatally, and demonstrate that it is secondary to decreased osteoblast proliferation and function in a Cbfa1-independent manner. Lrp5 is expressed in osteoblasts and is required for optimal Wnt signaling in osteoblasts. In addition, Lrp5-deficient mice display persistent embryonic eye vascularization due to a failure of macrophage-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. These results implicate Wnt proteins in the postnatal control of vascular regression and bone formation, two functions affected in many diseases. Moreover, these features recapitulate human osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome, caused by LRP5 inactivation.",

        "Title": "p53 mutant mice that display early ageing-associated phenotypes.",
        "Abstract": "The p53 tumour suppressor is activated by numerous stressors to induce apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, or senescence. To study the biological effects of altered p53 function, we generated mice with a deletion mutation in the first six exons of the p53 gene that express a truncated RNA capable of encoding a carboxy-terminal p53 fragment. This mutation confers phenotypes consistent with activated p53 rather than inactivated p53. Mutant (p53+/m) mice exhibit enhanced resistance to spontaneous tumours compared with wild-type (p53+/+) littermates. As p53+/m mice age, they display an early onset of phenotypes associated with ageing. These include reduced longevity, osteoporosis, generalized organ atrophy and a diminished stress tolerance. A second line of transgenic mice containing a temperature-sensitive mutant allele of p53 also exhibits early ageing phenotypes. These data suggest that p53 has a role in regulating organismal ageing.",

        "Abstract": "Previously, we determined that the activator protein-1 (AP-1)-binding site and the runt domain (RD)-binding site and their binding proteins, c-Fos.c-Jun and Cbfa, regulate the collagenase-3 promoter in parathyroid hormone-treated and differentiating osteoblasts. Here we show that Cbfa1 and c-Fos.c-Jun appear to cooperatively bind the RD- and AP-1-binding sites and form ternary structures in vitro. Both in vitro and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid studies further demonstrate interaction between Cbfa1 with c-Fos and c-Jun in the absence of phosphorylation and without binding to DNA. Additionally, only the runt domain of Cbfa1 was required for interaction with c-Jun and c-Fos. In mammalian cells, overexpression of Cbfa1 enhanced c-Jun activation of AP-1-binding site promoter activity, demonstrating functional interaction. Finally, insertion of base pairs that disrupted the helical phasing between the AP-1- and RD-binding sites also inhibited collagenase-3 promoter activation. Thus, we provide direct evidence that Cbfa1 and c-Fos.c-Jun physically interact and cooperatively bind the AP-1- and RD-binding sites in the collagenase-3 promoter. Moreover, the AP-1- and RD-binding sites appear to be organized in a specific required helical arrangement that facilitates transcription factor interaction and enables promoter activation.",
