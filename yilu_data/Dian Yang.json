        "Abstract": "To access degradable polyolefin plastic, non-alternating copolymerization of ethylene (E) and carbon monoxide (CO) for producing polyethylene (PE) with in-chain ketones is particularly appealing; however, it still presents significant challenges such as molecular weight modulation (hydrogen response) and chain endgroup control (functional terminal). In this study, we achieved hydrogen-controlled E/CO non-alternating copolymerization using late transition metal catalysts. This process results in linear PEs containing the desired non-alternating in-chain keto groups (1.0-9.3 mol%) and with tunable molecular weights ranging from 43 to 195 kDa. In this reaction, H2 serves as a chain transfer agent, modulating the polymer's molecular weight, forming unique aldehyde endgroups and eliminating usual olefinic endgroups; CO undergoes non-alternating insertion into the PE chain, resulting in a strictly non-alternating structure (> 99%) for the keto-PE. The dispersed incorporation of in-chain keto groups retains bulk properties of PE and makes PE susceptible to photodegradation, which produces significantly lower molecular weight polymers and oligomers with unambiguous vinyl and acetyl terminals.",

        "Abstract": "Seed endophytes played a crucial role on host plants stress tolerance and heavy metal (HM) accumulation. Dysphania ambrosioides is a hyperaccumulator and showed strong tolerance and extraordinary accumulation capacities of multiple HMs. However, little is known about its seed endophytes response to field HM-contamination, and its role on host plants HM tolerance and accumulation. In this study, the seed endophytic community of D. ambrosioides from HM-contaminated area (H) and non-contaminated area (N) were investigated by both culture-dependent and independent methods. Moreover, Cd tolerance and the plant growth promoting (PGP) traits of dominant endophytes from site H and N were evaluated. The results showed that in both studies, HM-contamination reduced the diversity and richness of endophytic community and changed the most dominant endophyte, but increased resistant species abundance. By functional trait assessments, a great number of dominant endophytes displayed multiple PGP traits and Cd tolerance. Interestingly, soil HM-contamination significantly increased the percentage of Cd tolerance isolates of Agrobacterium and Epicoccum, but significantly decreased the ration of Agrobacterium with the siderophore production ability. However, the other PGP traits of isolates from site H and N showed no significant difference. Therefore, it was suggested that D. ambrosioides might improve its HM tolerance and accumulation through harboring more HM-resistant endophytes rather than PGP endophytes, but to prove this, more work need to be conducted in the future.",

        "Title": "Identifying influential nodes based on the disassortativity and community structure of complex network.",
        "Abstract": "The complex networks exhibit significant heterogeneity in node connections, resulting in a few nodes playing critical roles in various scenarios, including decision-making, disease control, and population immunity. Therefore, accurately identifying these influential nodes that play crucial roles in networks is very important. Many methods have been proposed in different fields to solve this issue. This paper focuses on the different types of disassortativity existing in networks and innovatively introduces the concept of disassortativity of the node, namely, the inconsistency between the degree of a node and the degrees of its neighboring nodes, and proposes a measure of disassortativity of the node (DoN) by a step function. Furthermore, the paper analyzes and indicates that in many real-world network applications, such as online social networks, the influence of nodes within the network is often associated with disassortativity of the node and the community boundary structure of the network. Thus, the influential metric of node based on disassortativity and community structure (mDC) is proposed. Extensive experiments are conducted in synthetic and real networks, and the performance of the DoN and mDC is validated through network robustness experiments and immune experiment of disease infection. Experimental and analytical results demonstrate that compared to other state-of-the-art centrality measures, the proposed methods (DoN and mDC) exhibits superior identification performance and efficiency, particularly in non-disassortative networks and networks with clear community structures. Furthermore, we find that the DoN and mDC exhibit high stability to network noise and inaccuracies of the network data.",

        "Abstract": "Embryogenesis requires substantial coordination to translate genetic programs to the collective behavior of differentiating cells, but understanding how cellular decisions control tissue morphology remains conceptually and technically challenging. Here, we combine continuous Cas9-based molecular recording with a mouse embryonic stem cell-based model of the embryonic trunk to build single-cell phylogenies that describe the behavior of transient, multipotent neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs) as they commit into neural and somitic cell types. We find that NMPs show subtle transcriptional signatures related to their recent differentiation and contribute to downstream lineages through a surprisingly broad distribution of individual fate outcomes. Although decision-making can be heavily influenced by environmental cues to induce morphological phenotypes, axial progenitors intrinsically mature over developmental time to favor the neural lineage. Using these data, we present an experimental and analytical framework for exploring the non-homeostatic dynamics of transient progenitor populations as they shape complex tissues during critical developmental windows.",

        "Abstract": "Macrophage immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-CD47 antibodies, show promise in clinical trials for solid and hematologic malignancies. However, the best strategies to use these therapies remain unknown, and ongoing studies suggest they may be most effective when used in combination with other anticancer agents. Here, we developed an unbiased, high-throughput screening platform to identify drugs that render lung cancer cells more vulnerable to macrophage attack, and we found that therapeutic synergy exists between genotype-directed therapies and anti-CD47 antibodies. In validation studies, we found that the combination of genotype-directed therapies and CD47 blockade elicited robust phagocytosis and eliminated persister cells in vitro and maximized antitumor responses in vivo. Importantly, these findings broadly applied to lung cancers with various RTK/MAPK pathway alterations - including EGFR mutations, ALK fusions, or KRASG12C mutations. We observed downregulation of \u03b22-microglobulin and CD73 as molecular mechanisms contributing to enhanced sensitivity to macrophage attack. Our findings demonstrate that dual inhibition of the RTK/MAPK pathway and the CD47/SIRPa axis is a promising immunotherapeutic strategy. Our study provides strong rationale for testing this therapeutic combination in patients with lung cancers bearing driver mutations.",

        "Abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe genetic disease caused by the loss of the dystrophin protein. Exon skipping is a promising strategy to treat DMD by restoring truncated dystrophin. Here, we demonstrate that base editors (e.g., targeted AID-mediated mutagenesis [TAM]) are able to efficiently induce exon skipping by disrupting functional redundant exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). By developing an unbiased and high-throughput screening to interrogate exonic sequences, we successfully identify novel ESEs in DMD exons 51 and 53. TAM-CBE (cytidine base editor) induces near-complete skipping of the respective exons by targeting these ESEs in patients' induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. Combined with strategies to disrupt splice sites, we identify suitable single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with TAM-CBE to efficiently skip most DMD hotspot exons without substantial double-stranded breaks. Our study thus expands the repertoire of potential targets for CBE-mediated exon skipping in treating DMD and other RNA mis-splicing diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Brain metastases represent an important clinical problem for patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, the mechanisms underlying SCLC growth in the brain remain poorly understood. Here, using intracranial injections in mice and assembloids between SCLC aggregates and human cortical organoids in culture, we found that SCLC cells recruit reactive astrocytes to the tumour microenvironment. This crosstalk between SCLC cells and astrocytes drives the induction of gene expression programmes that are similar to those found during early brain development in neurons and astrocytes. Mechanistically, the brain development factor Reelin, secreted by SCLC cells, recruits astrocytes to brain metastases. These astrocytes in turn promote SCLC growth by secreting neuronal pro-survival factors such as SERPINE1. Thus, SCLC brain metastases grow by co-opting mechanisms involved in reciprocal neuron-astrocyte interactions during brain development. Targeting such developmental programmes activated in this cancer ecosystem may help prevent and treat brain metastases.",

        "Abstract": "The ubiquitin-proteasome system governs a wide spectrum of cellular events and offers therapeutic opportunities for pharmacological intervention in cancer treatment. Renal clear cell carcinoma represents the predominant histological subtype and accounts for the majority of cancer death related to kidney malignancies. Through a systematic survey in the association of human ubiquitin-specific proteases with patient prognosis of renal clear cell carcinoma and subsequent phenotypic validation, we uncovered the tumor-promoting role of USP35. Biochemical characterizations confirmed the stabilizing effects of USP35 towards multiple members of the IAP family in an enzymatic activity-dependent manner. USP35 silencing led to reduced expression levels of IAP proteins, which were accompanied with increased cellular apoptosis. Further transcriptomic analysis revealed that USP35 knockdown affected the expression levels of NRF2 downstream transcripts, which were conferred by compromised NRF2 abundance. USP35 functions to maintain NRF2 levels by catalyzing its deubiquitylation and thus antagonizing degradation. NRF2 reduction imposed by USP35 silencing rendered renal clear cell carcinoma cells increased sensitivity to ferroptosis induction. Finally, induced USP35 knockdown markedly attenuated xenograft formation of renal clear cell carcinoma in nude mice. Hence, our findings reveal a number of USP35 substrates and uncover the protecting roles of USP35 against both apoptosis and ferroptosis in renal clear cell carcinoma.",

        "Abstract": "Copper (Cu) was recently demonstrated to play a critical role in cellular physiological and biochemical processes, including energy production and maintenance, antioxidation and enzymatic activity, and signal transduction. Antioxidant 1 (ATOX1), a chaperone of Cu previously named human ATX1 homologue (HAH1), has been found to play an indispensable role in maintaining cellular Cu homeostasis, antioxidative stress, and transcriptional regulation. In the past decade, it has also been found to be involved in a variety of diseases, including numerous neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and metabolic diseases. Recently, increasing evidence has revealed that ATOX1 is involved in the regulation of cell migration, proliferation, autophagy, DNA damage repair (DDR), and death, as well as in organism development and reproduction. This review summarizes recent advances in the research on the diverse physiological and cytological functions of ATOX1 and the underlying mechanisms of its action in human health and diseases. The potential of ATOX1 as a therapeutic target is also discussed. This review aims to pose unanswered questions related to ATOX1 biology and explore the potential use of ATOX1 as a therapeutic target.",

However, the best strategies to use these therapies remain unknown and ongoing studies suggest they may be most effective when used in combination with other anticancer agents. Here, we developed a novel screening platform to identify drugs that render lung cancer cells more vulnerable to macrophage attack, and we identified therapeutic synergy exists between genotype-directed therapies and anti-CD47 antibodies. In validation studies, we found the combination of genotype-directed therapies and CD47 blockade elicited robust phagocytosis and eliminated persister cells in vitro and maximized anti-tumor responses in vivo.

        "Abstract": "Green tides attack the Yellow Sea every year since 2007 and have caused substantial financial loss. Based on Haiyang-1C/Coastal zone imager (HY-1C/CZI) and Terra/MODIS satellite images, the temporal and spatial distribution of green tides floating in the Yellow Sea during 2019 was extracted. The relationships between the growth rate of the green tides and the environmental factors including sea surface temperature (SST), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), sea surface salinity (SSS), nitrate and phosphate during the green tides' dissipation phase has been detected. Based on the maximum likelihood estimation, a regression model that includes SST, PAR and phosphate was recommended to predict the growth rate of the green tides in the dissipation phase (R",

        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor. The purpose of this study is to estimate the potential effects and underlying mechanisms of a ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8) small-molecule inhibitor on the phenotypic characteristics of GBM cells. The growth, migration, invasion, and stemness of GBM LN229 and T98G cells were evaluated by conducting cell proliferation, colony formation, wound healing, transwell, Ki-67 staining, spheroid formation, and ionizing radiation assays, and the results collectively showed the suppressive effects of USP8 inhibition on GBM cells. Furthermore, transcriptomic profiling of GBM cells treated with the USP8 inhibitor deubiquitinase (DUB)-IN-1 revealed significantly altered mRNA expression induced by pharmacological USP8 inhibition, from which we confirmed downregulated Aurora kinase A (AURKA) protein levels using immunoblotting assays. Our findings indicated that the proliferation, invasion, and stemness of LN229 and T98G cells were markedly suppressed by USP8 inhibition. Pharmacological USP8 suppression elicits multiple tumor-inhibitory effects, likely through dysregulating various mRNA expression events, including that of the key cell cycle regulator and oncogenic protein AURKA. Therefore, our observations corroborate the GBM-supportive roles of USP8 and suggest pharmacological USP8 inhibition is a viable therapeutic approach to target GBM. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of action of the USP8 inhibitor DUB-IN-1 on GBM.",

        "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most common histological subtype, accounts for 40% of all cases. While existing genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) recapitulate the histological progression and transcriptional evolution of human LUAD, they are time-consuming and technically demanding. In contrast, cell line transplant models are fast and flexible, but these models fail to capture the full spectrum of disease progression. Organoid technologies provide a means to create next-generation cancer models that integrate the most advantageous features of autochthonous and transplant-based systems. However, robust and faithful LUAD organoid platforms are currently lacking. Here, we describe optimized conditions to continuously expand murine alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, a prominent cell of origin for LUAD, in organoid culture. These organoids display canonical features of AT2 cells, including marker gene expression, the presence of lamellar bodies, and an ability to differentiate into the AT1 lineage. We used this system to develop flexible and versatile immunocompetent organoid-based models of ",

        "Abstract": "Tumor evolution is driven by the progressive acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations that enable uncontrolled growth and expansion to neighboring and distal tissues. The study of phylogenetic relationships between cancer cells provides key insights into these processes. Here, we introduced an evolving lineage-tracing system with a single-cell RNA-seq readout into a mouse model of Kras;Trp53(KP)-driven lung adenocarcinoma and tracked tumor evolution from single-transformed cells to metastatic tumors at unprecedented resolution. We found that the loss of the initial, stable alveolar-type2-like state was accompanied by a transient increase in plasticity. This was followed by the adoption of distinct transcriptional programs that enable rapid expansion and, ultimately, clonal sweep of stable subclones capable of metastasizing. Finally, tumors develop through stereotypical evolutionary trajectories, and perturbing additional tumor suppressors accelerates progression by creating novel trajectories. Our study elucidates the hierarchical nature of tumor evolution and, more broadly, enables in-depth studies of tumor progression.",

        "Abstract": "Single-cell (sc)RNA-seq, together with RNA velocity and metabolic labeling, reveals cellular states and transitions at unprecedented resolution. Fully exploiting these data, however, requires kinetic models capable of unveiling governing regulatory functions. Here, we introduce an analytical framework dynamo (https://github.com/aristoteleo/dynamo-release), which infers absolute RNA velocity, reconstructs continuous vector fields that predict cell fates, employs differential geometry to extract underlying regulations, and ultimately predicts optimal reprogramming paths and perturbation outcomes. We highlight dynamo's power to overcome fundamental limitations of conventional splicing-based RNA velocity analyses to enable accurate velocity estimations on a metabolically labeled human hematopoiesis scRNA-seq dataset. Furthermore, differential geometry analyses reveal mechanisms driving early megakaryocyte appearance and elucidate asymmetrical regulation within the PU.1-GATA1 circuit. Leveraging the least-action-path method, dynamo accurately predicts drivers of numerous hematopoietic transitions. Finally, in silico perturbations predict cell-fate diversions induced by gene perturbations. Dynamo, thus, represents an important step in advancing quantitative and predictive theories of cell-state transitions.",

        "Abstract": "Cells repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through a complex set of pathways critical for maintaining genomic integrity. To systematically map these pathways, we developed a high-throughput screening approach called Repair-seq that measures the effects of thousands of genetic perturbations on mutations introduced at targeted DNA lesions. Using Repair-seq, we profiled DSB repair products induced by two programmable nucleases (Cas9 and Cas12a) in the presence or absence of oligonucleotides for homology-directed repair (HDR) after knockdown of 476 genes involved in DSB repair or associated processes. The resulting data enabled principled, data-driven inference of DSB end joining and HDR pathways. Systematic interrogation of this data uncovered unexpected relationships among DSB repair genes and demonstrated that repair outcomes with superficially similar sequence architectures can have markedly different genetic dependencies. This work provides a foundation for mapping DNA repair pathways and for optimizing genome editing across diverse modalities.",

Such data often occur in many areas, including epidemiological studies, medical studies, and social sciences. For the problem, a class of semiparametric transformation nonmixture cure models is presented and for estimation, the maximum likelihood estimation procedure is derived. For the implementation of the proposed method, we develop a novel EM algorithm based on a Poisson variable-based augmentation. An extensive simulation study is conducted and suggests that the proposed approach works well in practical situations. Finally the method is applied to an example that motivated this study.",

        "Abstract": "Programmable C\u2022G-to-G\u2022C base editors (CGBEs) have broad scientific and therapeutic potential, but their editing outcomes have proved difficult to predict and their editing efficiency and product purity are often low. We describe a suite of engineered CGBEs paired with machine learning models to enable efficient, high-purity C\u2022G-to-G\u2022C base editing. We performed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen targeting DNA repair genes to identify factors that affect C\u2022G-to-G\u2022C editing outcomes and used these insights to develop CGBEs with diverse editing profiles. We characterized ten promising CGBEs on a library of 10,638\u2009genomically integrated target sites in mammalian cells and trained machine learning models that accurately predict the purity and yield of editing outcomes (R\u2009=\u20090.90) using these data. These CGBEs enable correction to the wild-type coding sequence of 546\u2009disease-related transversion single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) with\u2009>90% precision (mean 96%) and up to 70% efficiency (mean 14%). Computational prediction of optimal CGBE-single-guide RNA pairs enables high-purity transversion base editing at over fourfold more target sites than achieved using any single CGBE variant.",

        "Abstract": "The presence of excessive ROS can cause much harm to the human body and can even cause diseases. Therefore, it is important to detect and remove ROS, but there is no ideal method available for this at present. In this research, using procyanidins, a type of plant extract with strong reducibility, as raw materials, fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) were prepared by a hydrothermal method. The proanthocyanidin-based carbon dots (PCDs) emit a light-green colored light under UV irradiation. The PCDs retain the strong reducibility of procyanidins and are highly water-soluble compared with procyanidins. The PCDs, in addition to having good biocompatibility, also have the superior properties of radical scavenging activity and cell imaging. In in vitro experiments, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH; 100 \u03bcM) was reduced by 30% when PCDs were added up to a concentration of 87.5 \u03bcg mL",

It is well known that harmful high levels of ROS can cause many problems in living organisms in a variety of ways. One effective way to remove intracellular ROS is to use reducing materials that can enter the cell. Herein, we developed a strong reducing carbon nano-dot from a natural product, lutein, as an initial raw material. This is a hydrothermal synthesis method with the advantages of simplicity, high yield, mild reaction conditions, and environmental friendliness. The prepared carbon dots exhibit bright blue fluorescence, and have good water solubility and biocompatibility. In particular, the carbon dots can easily enter the cell and effectively remove ROS.

At the present time, clinical and forensic autopsies have given guidance and explanations in relation to the problem of COVID-19 transmission and defense. However, less attention is paid to the handling of COVID-19 biological samples in forensic practice. Particularly, COVID-19 can survive on some surfaces for days. Since there were many cases involving COVID-19 during the epidemic, this article shares the methods and strategies for handling such inspection materials and the biological samples related specifically to COVID-19 cases.",

        "Title": "Application of Y-chromosomal microdeletions in a homicide case.",
        "Abstract": "A case study involving an intentional homicide case in November 2018, in which the autosomal genotypes of the suspect were unavailable and only part of deletions of Y-STR loci were identified by Y-chromosomal typing. The suspect, male, was charged with beating the decedent, female, over the head with an iron water pipe to death. The use of standard autosomal DNA profiling to identify the suspect was unattainable due to the extensive volume blood of the decedent on the murder weapon which was inevitably cleaned by running water at the crime scene. As a result, autosomal genotypes of the suspect were unavailable and only partial samples of deletions of Y-STR loci were identified by Y-chromosomal typing. Y-STR analysis (Yfiler\u2122 plus and AGCU Y36) was used on the collected DNA extracts and compared to reference samples of the suspect, as well as his father and brother in an attempt to positively identify the suspect as the perpetrator of the murder. Subsequent Y-STR genotyping for the suspect, his father and brother indicated that Y-STR genotype of the suspect was consistent with that discovered on the physical evidence and the deleted Y-STR loci were identical for both. No deletions of Y-STR genotype were observed in the suspect's father and brother. After changing a Y-STR kit, the deleted loci were still present in the suspect. In Addition, sequencing of the whole Y-chromosomal genes was performed on the samples taken from the suspect and his father and brother. Segmental deletions at Yq 11.222-Yq 11.23 of the suspect were observed and the deleted Y-STR markers were right on the deleted Y-chromosomal segments. In this case, although the suspect could not be identified by the autosomal STR profiles detected on the physical evidence, the discovery of identical Y-STR genotype and the identical deletions of Y-chromosomal segments made it plausible that DNA on the murder weapon was left behind by the suspect. This case study shows that in criminal cases like this, where the autosomal STR evidence is unattainable, Y-STR evidence can be used effectively as a substitute to identify the suspect.",

        "Abstract": "Metastasis is the main cause of death in cancer patients but remains a poorly understood process. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most lethal and most metastatic cancer types. SCLC cells normally express neuroendocrine and neuronal gene programs but accumulating evidence indicates that these cancer cells become relatively more neuronal and less neuroendocrine as they gain the ability to metastasize. Here we show that mouse and human SCLC cells in culture and in vivo can grow cellular protrusions that resemble axons. The formation of these protrusions is controlled by multiple neuronal factors implicated in axonogenesis, axon guidance, and neuroblast migration. Disruption of these axon-like protrusions impairs cell migration in culture and inhibits metastatic ability in vivo. The co-option of developmental neuronal programs is a novel molecular and cellular mechanism that contributes to the high metastatic ability of SCLC.",

        "Abstract": "It is well known that the calcium ion is essential for maintaining life activities in living organisms, and it is of great significance to detect the intracellular calcium concentration. For the detection of calcium ions, we developed a new type of fluorescent carbon dots (CDs), whose surface was modified by ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)tetraacetic acid (EGTA) through a secondary hydrothermal method. This is a simple and convenient chemical preparation method because all reactions are carried out in the same autoclave, and the final product is directly the EGTA-modified CDs. The CDs exhibit bright blue fluorescence, and as the calcium concentration increases, the fluorescence intensity drops sharply. The fluorescence quenching correlates with the concentration of calcium ions and has a good linearity in the range of 15-300 \u03bcM with a detection limit of 0.38 \u03bcM. The experimental results confirmed that the detection of calcium ions by CDs is a static fluorescence quenching process. Also, cytotoxicity test and cellular imaging experiments have shown that the CDs are nontoxic and biocompatible.",

        "Abstract": "Ontogeny describes the emergence of complex multicellular organisms from single totipotent cells. This field is particularly challenging in mammals, owing to the indeterminate relationship between self-renewal and differentiation, variation in progenitor field sizes, and internal gestation in these animals. Here we present a flexible, high-information, multi-channel molecular recorder with a single-cell readout and apply it as an evolving lineage tracer to assemble mouse cell-fate maps from fertilization through gastrulation. By combining lineage information with single-cell RNA sequencing profiles, we recapitulate canonical developmental relationships between different tissue types and reveal the nearly complete transcriptional convergence of endodermal cells of extra-embryonic and embryonic origins. Finally, we apply our cell-fate maps to estimate the number of embryonic progenitor cells and their degree of asymmetric partitioning during specification. Our approach enables massively parallel, high-resolution recording of lineage and other information in mammalian systems, which will facilitate the construction of a quantitative framework for understanding developmental processes.",

        "Abstract": "Bilayer-type hydrogel composites that respond to multiple stimuli provide a useful approach for manufacturing soft actuators and intelligent sensors. In this study, we propose two types of bilayer hydrogel composites (referred to as \"N\" type and \"D\" type). The \"N\" type and the \"D\" type separately consist of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) bilayer hydrogels, with acrylamide (AM) as the co-monomer. The \"N\" type hydrogel composite exhibits oriented bending as temperature increases or as environmental salt concentration increases. The \"D\" type also presents oriented bending as temperature increases. Additionally, it demonstrates bending and changes color based on the pH of the surrounding solution, since it is doped with an acid-based pH-indicator. In a demonstration, we present several straight rods composed of a mixture of \"N\" and \"D\" type hydrogel composites that are able to morph into the letters \"SOS\" under environmental changes (temperature or pH). This can be used as a visual environmental indicator, or as an alarm. Furthermore, we show structures composed of a mixture of \"N\" and \"D\" composites imitating the flexible motions of a ballet dancer or a Tai Chi master. These mixed bilayer polymer composites may be used for applications in soft robotics, biomimetic devices, and environmental sensors.",

Here, using genetically defined mouse models of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), we uncovered distinct metastatic programs attributable to the cell type of origin. In one model, tumors gain metastatic ability through amplification of the transcription factor NFIB and a widespread increase in chromatin accessibility, whereas in the other model, tumors become metastatic in the absence of NFIB-driven chromatin alterations. Gene-expression and chromatin accessibility analyses identify distinct mechanisms as well as markers predictive of metastatic progression in both groups. Underlying the difference between the two programs was the cell type of origin of the tumors, with NFIB-independent metastases arising from mature neuroendocrine cells. Our findings underscore the importance of the identity of cell type of origin in influencing tumor evolution and metastatic mechanisms.",

This robot was built using buckling pneumatic actuators (vacuum-actuated muscle-inspired pneumatic structures, or VAMPs). The tube climber can navigate through a tube with turns, inclines, and varying diameters. The robot is also able to remove obstacles (of more than 10 times its own weight) from tubes to perform a clearing function. It maintains climbing and clearing performance in wet conditions and under water. The tube climber is lightweight and completely soft and thus has the potential to be collaborative (i.e., work with humans) and also to interact safely with delicate environments.",

        "Abstract": "This article describes a soft pneumatic actuator that generates cyclical motion. The actuator consists of several (three, four, or five) chambers (arranged around the circumference of a circle surrounding a central rod) that can be actuated independently using negative pressure (or partial vacuum). Sequential actuation of the four-chamber device using reduced pressure moves the central rod cyclically in an approximately square path. We characterize the trajectory of the actuator and the force exerted by it, as we vary the material used for fabrication, the number of chambers, and the size of the actuator. We demonstrate two applications of this actuator: to deliver fluid while stirring (by replacing the central rod with a needle) and for locomotion that mimics a reptilian gait (by combining four actuators together).",

        "Abstract": "There is a pressing need to develop nanoplatforms that integrate multimodal therapeutics to improve treatment responses and prolong the survival of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mesoporous silica-coated gold nanomaterials have emerged as a novel multifunctional platform combining tunable surface plasmon resonance and mesoporous properties that exhibit multimodality properties in cancer theranostics. However, their reduced radiation-absorption efficiency and limited surface area hinder their further radiochemotherapeutic applications. To address these issues, we designed Janus-structured gold-mesoporous silica nanoparticles using a modified sol-gel method. This multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform was subsequently modified via the conjugation of folic acid for enhanced HCC targeting and internalization. The loaded anticancer agent doxorubicin can be released from the mesopores in a pH-responsive manner, facilitating selective and safe chemotherapy. Additionally, the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy induced synergistic anticancer effects in vitro and exhibited remarkable inhibition of tumor growth in vivo along with significantly reduced systematic toxicity. Additionally, the Janus NPs acted as targeted computed tomography (CT)-imaging agents for HCC diagnosis. Given their better performance in chemoradiotherapy and CT imaging as compared with that of their core-shell counterparts, this new nanoplatform designed with dual functionalities provides a promising strategy for unresectable HCC theranostics.",

        "Abstract": "Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as a promising tool for suicide gene therapy. However, the separate delivery of the suicide gene and prodrug in current systems limits their clinical translation. Therefore, improving magnetically mediated suicide gene therapy by exploring higher performance magnetic NP-based hybrid nanoplatforms is an important challenge. In the current study, shape-controlled magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (M-MSNs) were prepared, and their performance in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided, magnetically targeted and hyperthermia-enhanced suicide gene therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was investigated. Compared with sphere-like MSNs, rod-like MSNs exhibited higher loading capacity, faster prodrug release behavior, stronger magnetically enhanced gene delivery and better magnetic hyperthermia properties. Utilizing the improved magnetic properties of the M-MSNs allowed us to demonstrate highly effective dual magnetically enhanced suicide gene therapy in\u00a0vivo with decreased systematic toxicity and with the ability to monitor therapeutic outcome by MRI. Because of their magnetic targeting abilities, magnetic hyperthermia performance and MRI properties, these M-MSNs might prove to be a potentially superior candidate for suicide gene therapy of HCC.",

In this study, we designed a light-responsive nanoplatform with folic acid-targeting properties to surmount the poor aqueous stability and photostability of indocyanine green (ICG). In this Janus nanostructure, ICG was released on-demand from mesoporous silica compartments in response to near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, exhibiting predominant properties to convert light to heat in the cytoplasm to kill liver cancer cells. Importantly, the silver ions released from the silver compartment that were triggered by light could induce efficient chemotherapy to supplement photothermal therapy. Under NIR irradiation, ICG-loaded Janus nanoplatforms exhibited synergistic therapeutic capabilities both in vitro and in vivo compared with free ICG and ICG-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles themselves. Hence, our Janus nanoplatform could integrate ICG-based photothermal therapy and silver ion-based chemotherapy in a cascade manner, which might provide an efficient and safe strategy for combined liver cancer therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most metastatic and deadly cancers. Despite the clinical significance of metastatic spread, our understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive PDAC metastatic ability remains limited. By generating a genetically engineered mouse model of human PDAC, we uncover a transient subpopulation of cancer cells with exceptionally high metastatic ability. Global gene expression profiling and functional analyses uncovered the transcription factor BLIMP1 as a driver of PDAC metastasis. The highly metastatic PDAC subpopulation is enriched for hypoxia-induced genes, and hypoxia-mediated induction of BLIMP1 contributes to the regulation of a subset of hypoxia-associated gene expression programs. These findings support a model in which upregulation of BLIMP1 links microenvironmental cues to a metastatic stem cell character.",

        "Abstract": "In this study, we exploited a one-pot method to fabricate cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-loaded Janus silver mesoporous silica nanoparticles (Janus Ag-MSNs@CTAB). These bullet-like nanoparticles had a silver head (80nm in diameter) attached to a mesoporous silica stick (200-300nm in length). The CTAB-loaded nanobullets exhibited a marked affinity for the bacterial cell surface and the simultaneously sustained release behavior of CTAB and silver ions. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of Janus Ag-MSNs@CTAB were determined to be 10\u03bcg/mL and 20\u03bcg/mL for E. coli and S. Aureus, respectively. Importantly, Janus Ag-MSNs@CTAB provided a single-particle nanoplatform with a synergistic effect against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. A thorough investigation indicated that CTAB induces a dramatic loss of bacterial membrane integrity, which facilitated the internalization of silver. This report described an efficient and convenient method of synthesizing Janus silver mesoporous silica nanoparticles, and these nanobullets show promising potential in biomedical applications.",

However, it remains a challenge to simultaneously enhance the radio-sensitivity of tumor tissue, develop tumor tissue-focused radiation therapies and combine dual therapeutic modalities. In this study, core-shell type magnetic gold (Fe\u2083O\u2084@Au) nanoparticles are exploited to achieve the synergistic efficacy of radio-photothermal therapy in cervical cancer. Fe\u2083O\u2084@Au nanoparticles (NPs) with uniform morphology exhibited superior surface plasmon resonance properties, excellent superparamagnetic properties, good biocompatibility and high photothermal conversion efficiency. For the in vitro tests, a low concentration of Fe\u2083O\u2084@Au NPs after a short period of near-infrared irradiation lead to the time-dependent death of cervical cancer cells. Further, the combination of RT and PTT induced synergistic anti-cancer effects in vitro. More importantly, an external magnetic field could significantly enhance the synergistic efficacy of Fe\u2083O\u2084@Au NPs by improving their internalization. Hence, the reported Fe\u2083O\u2084@Au NPs have the potential to be good nanoagents with excellent magnetic targeting ability for cervical cancer radio-photothermal treatment.",

        "Title": "Intratumoural heterogeneity generated by Notch signalling promotes small-cell lung cancer.",
        "Abstract": "The Notch signalling pathway mediates cell fate decisions and is tumour suppressive or oncogenic depending on the context. During lung development, Notch pathway activation inhibits the differentiation of precursor cells to a neuroendocrine fate. In small-cell lung cancer, an aggressive neuroendocrine lung cancer, loss-of-function mutations in NOTCH genes and the inhibitory effects of ectopic Notch activation indicate that Notch signalling is tumour suppressive. Here we show that Notch signalling can be both tumour suppressive and pro-tumorigenic in small-cell lung cancer. Endogenous activation of the Notch pathway results in a neuroendocrine to non-neuroendocrine fate switch in 10-50% of tumour cells in a mouse model of small-cell lung cancer and in human tumours. This switch is mediated in part by Rest (also known as Nrsf), a transcriptional repressor that inhibits neuroendocrine gene expression. Non-neuroendocrine Notch-active small-cell lung cancer cells are slow growing, consistent with a tumour-suppressive role for Notch, but these cells are also relatively chemoresistant and provide trophic support to neuroendocrine tumour cells, consistent with a pro-tumorigenic role. Importantly, Notch blockade in combination with chemotherapy suppresses tumour growth and delays relapse in pre-clinical models. Thus, small-cell lung cancer tumours generate their own microenvironment via activation of Notch signalling in a subset of tumour cells, and the presence of these cells may serve as a biomarker for the use of Notch pathway inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy in select patients with small-cell lung cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with the majority of mortality resulting from metastatic spread. However, the molecular mechanism by which cancer cells acquire the ability to disseminate from primary tumors, seed distant organs, and grow into tissue-destructive metastases remains incompletely understood. We combined tumor barcoding in a mouse model of human lung adenocarcinoma with unbiased genomic approaches to identify a transcriptional program that confers metastatic ability and predicts patient survival. Small-scale in vivo screening identified several genes, including Cd109, that encode novel pro-metastatic factors. We uncovered signaling mediated by Janus kinases (Jaks) and the transcription factor Stat3 as a critical, pharmacologically targetable effector of CD109-driven lung cancer metastasis. In summary, by coupling the systematic genomic analysis of purified cancer cells in distinct malignant states from mouse models with extensive human validation, we uncovered several key regulators of metastatic ability, including an actionable pro-metastatic CD109-Jak-Stat3 axis.",

However, such screens are generally performed in vitro under conditions that do not necessarily model complex physiological conditions or disease states. Here, we use molecular cell barcoding to enable direct in vivo phenotypic screening of small-molecule libraries. The multiplexed nature of this approach allows rapid in vivo analysis of hundreds to thousands of compounds. Using this platform, we screened >700 covalent inhibitors directed toward hydrolases for their effect on pancreatic cancer metastatic seeding. We identified multiple hits and confirmed the relevant target of one compound as the lipase ABHD6. Pharmacological and genetic studies confirmed the role of this enzyme as a regulator of metastatic fitness. Our results highlight the applicability of this multiplexed screening platform for investigating complex processes in vivo.",

We isolated pure populations of cancer cells from primary tumors and metastases from a genetically engineered mouse model of human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) to investigate the mechanisms that drive the metastatic spread of\u00a0this lethal cancer. Genome-wide characterization of chromatin accessibility revealed the opening of large numbers of distal regulatory elements across the genome during metastatic progression. These changes correlate with copy number amplification of the Nfib locus, and differentially accessible sites were highly enriched for Nfib transcription factor binding sites. Nfib is necessary and sufficient to increase chromatin accessibility at a large subset of the intergenic regions. Nfib promotes pro-metastatic neuronal gene expression programs and drives the metastatic ability of SCLC cells. The identification of widespread chromatin changes during SCLC progression reveals an unexpected global reprogramming during metastatic progression.",

        "Abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a neuroendocrine lung cancer characterized by fast growth, early dissemination, and rapid resistance to chemotherapy. We identified a population of long-term tumor-propagating cells (TPCs) in a mouse model of SCLC. This population, marked by high levels of EpCAM and CD24, is also prevalent in human primary SCLC tumors. Murine SCLC TPCs are numerous and highly proliferative but not intrinsically chemoresistant, indicating that not all clinical features of SCLC\u00a0are linked to TPCs. SCLC TPCs possess a distinct transcriptional profile compared to non-TPCs, including elevated MYC activity. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of MYC in SCLC cells to non-TPC levels inhibits long-term propagation but not short-term growth. These studies identify a highly tumorigenic population of SCLC cells in mouse models, cell lines, and patient tumors and a means to target them in this most fatal form of lung cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive subtype of lung cancer with limited treatment options. CD47 is a cell-surface molecule that promotes immune evasion by engaging signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRP\u03b1), which serves as an inhibitory receptor on macrophages. Here, we found that CD47 is highly expressed on the surface of human SCLC cells; therefore, we investigated CD47-blocking immunotherapies as a potential approach for SCLC treatment. Disruption of the interaction of CD47 with SIRP\u03b1 using anti-CD47 antibodies induced macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of human SCLC patient cells in culture. In a murine model, administration of CD47-blocking antibodies or targeted inactivation of the Cd47 gene markedly inhibited SCLC tumor growth. Furthermore, using comprehensive antibody arrays, we identified several possible therapeutic targets on the surface of SCLC cells. Antibodies to these targets, including CD56/neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), promoted phagocytosis in human SCLC cell lines that was enhanced when combined with CD47-blocking therapies. In light of recent clinical trials for CD47-blocking therapies in cancer treatment, these findings identify disruption of the CD47/SIRP\u03b1 axis as a potential immunotherapeutic strategy for SCLC. This approach could enable personalized immunotherapeutic regimens in patients with SCLC and other cancers.",

        "Abstract": "Projecting the distribution of malaria vectors under climate change is essential for planning integrated vector control activities for sustaining elimination and preventing reintroduction of malaria. In China, however, little knowledge exists on the possible effects of climate change on malaria vectors. Here we assess the potential impact of climate change on four dominant malaria vectors (An. dirus, An. minimus, An. lesteri and An. sinensis) using species distribution models for two future decades: the 2030\u2009s and the 2050\u2009s. Simulation-based estimates suggest that the environmentally suitable area (ESA) for An. dirus and An. minimus would increase by an average of 49% and 16%, respectively, under all three scenarios for the 2030\u2009s, but decrease by 11% and 16%, respectively in the 2050\u2009s. By contrast, an increase of 36% and 11%, respectively, in ESA of An. lesteri and An. sinensis, was estimated under medium stabilizing (RCP4.5) and very heavy (RCP8.5) emission scenarios. in the 2050\u2009s. In total, we predict a substantial net increase in the population exposed to the four dominant malaria vectors in the decades of the 2030\u2009s and 2050\u2009s, considering land use changes and urbanization simultaneously. Strategies to achieve and sustain malaria elimination in China will need to account for these potential changes in vector distributions and receptivity.",

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a genomically diverse, prevalent, and almost invariably fatal malignancy. Although conventional genetically engineered mouse models of human PDAC have been instrumental in understanding pancreatic cancer development, these models are much too labor-intensive, expensive, and slow to perform the extensive molecular analyses needed to adequately understand this disease. Here we demonstrate that retrograde pancreatic ductal injection of either adenoviral-Cre or lentiviral-Cre vectors allows titratable initiation of pancreatic neoplasias that progress into invasive and metastatic PDAC. To enable in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene inactivation in the pancreas, we generated a Cre-regulated Cas9 allele and lentiviral vectors that express Cre and a single-guide RNA. CRISPR-mediated targeting of Lkb1 in combination with oncogenic Kras expression led to selection for inactivating genomic alterations, absence of Lkb1 protein, and rapid tumor growth that phenocopied Cre-mediated genetic deletion of Lkb1. This method will transform our ability to rapidly interrogate gene function during the development of this recalcitrant cancer.",

        "Abstract": "We have sequenced the genomes of 110 small cell lung cancers (SCLC), one of the deadliest human cancers. In nearly all the tumours analysed we found bi-allelic inactivation of TP53 and RB1, sometimes by complex genomic rearrangements. Two tumours with wild-type RB1 had evidence of chromothripsis leading to overexpression of cyclin D1 (encoded by the CCND1 gene), revealing an alternative mechanism of Rb1 deregulation. Thus, loss of the tumour suppressors TP53 and RB1 is obligatory in SCLC. We discovered somatic genomic rearrangements of TP73 that create an oncogenic version of this gene, TP73\u0394ex2/3. In rare cases, SCLC tumours exhibited kinase gene mutations, providing a possible therapeutic opportunity for individual patients. Finally, we observed inactivating mutations in NOTCH family genes in 25% of human SCLC. Accordingly, activation of Notch signalling in a pre-clinical SCLC mouse model strikingly reduced the number of tumours and extended the survival of the mutant mice. Furthermore, neuroendocrine gene expression was abrogated by Notch activity in SCLC cells. This first comprehensive study of somatic genome alterations in SCLC uncovers several key biological processes and identifies candidate therapeutic targets in this highly lethal form of cancer.",

        "Abstract": "This paper describes several noncontact methods of orienting objects in 3D space using Magnetic Levitation (MagLev). The methods use two permanent magnets arranged coaxially with like poles facing and a container containing a paramagnetic liquid in which the objects are suspended. Absent external forcing, objects levitating in the device adopt predictable static orientations; the orientation depends on the shape and distribution of mass within the objects. The orientation of objects of uniform density in the MagLev device shows a sharp geometry-dependent transition: an analytical theory rationalizes this transition and predicts the orientation of objects in the MagLev device. Manipulation of the orientation of the levitating objects in space is achieved in two ways: (i) by rotating and/or translating the MagLev device while the objects are suspended in the paramagnetic solution between the magnets; (ii) by moving a small external magnet close to the levitating objects while keeping the device stationary. Unlike mechanical agitation or robotic selection, orienting using MagLev is possible for objects having a range of different physical characteristics (e.g., different shapes, sizes, and mechanical properties from hard polymers to gels and fluids). MagLev thus has the potential to be useful for sorting and positioning components in 3D space, orienting objects for assembly, constructing noncontact devices, and assembling objects composed of soft materials such as hydrogels, elastomers, and jammed granular media.",

        "Title": "Chirality-dependent friction of bulk molecular solids.",
        "Abstract": "We show that the solid-solid friction between bulk chiral molecular solids can depend on the relative chirality of the two materials. In menthol and 1-phenyl-1-butanol, heterochiral friction is smaller than homochiral friction, while in ibuprofen, heterochiral friction is larger. Chiral asymmetries in the coefficient of sliding friction vary with temperature and can be as large as 30%. In the three compounds tested, the sign of the difference between heterochiral and homochiral friction correlated with the sign of the difference in melting point between racemate (compound or conglomerate) and pure enantiomer. Menthol and ibuprofen each form a stable racemic compound, while 1-phenyl-1-butanol forms a racemic conglomerate. Thus, a difference between heterochiral and homochiral friction does not require the formation of a stable interfacial racemic compound. Measurements of chirality-dependent friction provide a unique means to distinguish the role of short-range intermolecular forces from all other sources of dissipation in the friction of bulk molecular solids.",

        "Abstract": "Despite its clinical importance, very little is known about the natural history and molecular underpinnings of lung cancer dissemination and metastasis. Here, we used a genetically engineered mouse model of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma in which cancer cells are fluorescently marked to determine whether dissemination is an inherent ability or a major acquired phenotype during lung adenocarcinoma metastasis. We find very little evidence for dissemination from oncogenic KRAS-driven hyperplasias or most adenocarcinomas. p53 loss is insufficient to drive dissemination but rather enables rare cancer cells in a small fraction of primary adenocarcinomas to gain alterations that drive dissemination. Molecular characterization of disseminated tumor cells indicates that downregulation of the transcription factor Nkx2-1 precedes dissemination. Finally, we show that metastatic primary tumors possess a highly proliferative subpopulation of cells with characteristics matching those of disseminating cells. We propose that dissemination is a major hurdle during the natural course of lung adenocarcinoma metastasis.",

        "Abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine subtype of lung cancer with high mortality. We used a systematic drug repositioning bioinformatics approach querying a large compendium of gene expression profiles to identify candidate U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to treat SCLC. We found that tricyclic antidepressants and related molecules potently induce apoptosis in both chemona\u00efve and chemoresistant SCLC cells in culture, in mouse and human SCLC tumors transplanted into immunocompromised mice, and in endogenous tumors from a mouse model for human SCLC. The candidate drugs activate stress pathways and induce cell death in SCLC cells, at least in part by disrupting autocrine survival signals involving neurotransmitters and their G protein-coupled receptors. The candidate drugs inhibit the growth of other neuroendocrine tumors, including pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and Merkel cell carcinoma. These experiments identify novel targeted strategies that can be rapidly evaluated in patients with neuroendocrine tumors through the repurposing of approved drugs.",

        "Abstract": "The MiniChromosome Maintenance 2-7 (MCM2-7) complex provides essential replicative helicase function. Insufficient MCMs impair the cell cycle and cause genomic instability (GIN), leading to cancer and developmental defects in mice. Remarkably, depletion or mutation of one Mcm can decrease all Mcm levels. Here, we use mice and cells bearing a GIN-causing hypomophic allele of Mcm4 (Chaos3), in conjunction with disruption alleles of other Mcms, to reveal two new mechanisms that regulate MCM protein levels and pre-RC formation. First, the Mcm4(Chaos3) allele, which disrupts MCM4:MCM6 interaction, triggers a Dicer1 and Drosha-dependent \u2248 40% reduction in Mcm2-7 mRNAs. The decreases in Mcm mRNAs coincide with up-regulation of the miR-34 family of microRNAs, which is known to be Trp53-regulated and target Mcms. Second, MCM3 acts as a negative regulator of the MCM2-7 helicase in vivo by complexing with MCM5 in a manner dependent upon a nuclear-export signal-like domain, blocking the recruitment of MCMs onto chromatin. Therefore, the stoichiometry of MCM components and their localization is controlled post-transcriptionally at both the mRNA and protein levels. Alterations to these pathways cause significant defects in cell growth reflected by disease phenotypes in mice.",

        "Abstract": "Similar to the Debye-H\u00fcckel plasma, charged groups in solutions of rigid rod polyelectrolytes attract each other. We derive expression for the correlation free energy of electrostatic attraction of the rods within the random phase approximation. In this theory, we explicitly take into account positions of charged groups on the chains and examine both charge and polymer concentration fluctuations. The correlation free energies and the osmotic pressures are calculated for isotropic and completely ordered nematic phase. The results of the discrete model are compared with results of a continuous model. The discrete model gives rise to a stronger attraction between the charged groups both in the isotropic and nematic phases and to a stronger orienting action of the electrostatic forces.",
