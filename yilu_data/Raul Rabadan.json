        "Abstract": "Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been used for cancer detection. However, DNA hemi-methylation, present at about 10% CpG dinucleotides, has been less well studied. Here we show that a majority of differentially hemi-methylated regions (DHMRs) in liver tumor DNA or plasma cells free (cf) DNA do not overlap with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of the same samples, indicating that DHMRs could serve as independent biomarkers. Furthermore, we analyzed the cfDNA methylomes of 215 samples from individuals with liver or brain cancer and individuals without cancer (controls), and trained machine learning models using DMRs, DHMRs or both. The models incorporated with both DMRs and DHMRs show a superior performance compared to models trained with DMRs or DHMRs, with AUROC being 0.978, 0.990, and 0.983 in distinguishing control, liver and brain cancer, respectively, in a validation cohort. This study supports the potential of utilizing both DMRs and DHMRs for multi-cancer detection.",

        "Abstract": "Transcriptional regulation, involving the complex interplay between regulatory sequences and proteins, directs all biological processes. Computational models of transcription lack generalizability to accurately extrapolate in unseen cell types and conditions. Here, we introduce GET, an interpretable foundation model designed to uncover regulatory grammars across 213 human fetal and adult cell types. Relying exclusively on chromatin accessibility data and sequence information, GET achieves experimental-level accuracy in predicting gene expression even in previously unseen cell types. GET showcases remarkable adaptability across new sequencing platforms and assays, enabling regulatory inference across a broad range of cell types and conditions, and uncovering universal and cell type specific transcription factor interaction networks. We evaluated its performance on prediction of regulatory activity, inference of regulatory elements and regulators, and identification of physical interactions between transcription factors. Specifically, we show GET outperforms current models in predicting lentivirus-based massive parallel reporter assay readout with reduced input data. In fetal erythroblasts, we identify distal (>1Mbp) regulatory regions that were missed by previous models. In B cells, we identified a lymphocyte-specific transcription factor-transcription factor interaction that explains the functional significance of a leukemia-risk predisposing germline mutation. In sum, we provide a generalizable and accurate model for transcription together with catalogs of gene regulation and transcription factor interactions, all with cell type specificity.",

        "Abstract": "The rapid advancement of sequencing technologies has led to the identification of numerous mutations in cancer genomes, many of which are variants of unknown significance (VUS). Computational models are increasingly being used to predict the functional impact of these mutations, in both coding and noncoding regions. Integration of these models with emerging genomic datasets will refine our understanding of mutation effects and guide clinical decision making. Future advancements in modeling protein interactions and transcriptional regulation will further enhance our ability to interpret VUS. Periodic incorporation of these developments into VUS reclassification practice has the potential to significantly improve personalized cancer care.",

        "Abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor protein, a sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor, regulates the expression of a large number of genes, in response to various forms of cellular stress. Although the protein coding target genes of p53 have been well studied, less is known about its role in regulating long noncoding genes and their functional relevance to cancer. Here we report the genome-wide identification of a large set (>1,000) of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA), which are putative p53 targets in a colon cancer cell line and in human patient datasets from five different common types of cancer. These lncRNAs have not been annotated by other studies of normal unstressed systems. In the colon cancer cell line, a high proportion of these lncRNAs are uniquely induced by different chemotherapeutic agents that activate p53, whereas others are induced by more than one agent tested. Further, subsets of these lncRNAs independently predict overall and disease-free survival of patients across the five different common cancer types. Interestingly, both genetic alterations and patient survival associated with different lncRNAs are unique to each cancer tested, indicating extraordinary tissue-specific variability in the p53 noncoding response. The newly identified noncoding p53 target genes have allowed us to construct a classifier for tumor diagnosis and prognosis.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have facilitated studies of cell states and plasticity in tissue maintenance and cancer, including in the prostate. Here we present meta-analyses of multiple new and published scRNA-seq datasets to establish reference cell type classifications for the normal mouse and human prostate. Our analyses demonstrate transcriptomic similarities between epithelial cell states in the normal prostate, in the regressed prostate after androgen-deprivation, and in primary prostate tumors. During regression in the mouse prostate, all epithelial cells shift their expression profiles towards a proximal periurethral (PrU) state, demonstrating an androgen-dependent plasticity that is restored to normal during androgen restoration and regeneration. In the human prostate, we find progressive rewiring of transcriptional programs across epithelial cell types in benign prostate hyperplasia and treatment-na\u00efve prostate cancer. Notably, we detect copy number variants predominantly within Luminal Acinar cells in prostate tumors, suggesting a bias in their cell type of origin, as well as a larger field of transcriptomic alterations in non-tumor cells. Finally, we observe that Luminal Acinar tumor cells in treatment-na\u00efve prostate cancer display heterogeneous androgen receptor (AR) signaling activity, including a split between high-AR and low-AR profiles with similarity to PrU-like states. Taken together, our analyses of cellular heterogeneity and plasticity provide important translational insights into the origin and treatment response of prostate cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Viral respiratory infections are an important public health concern due to their prevalence, transmissibility, and potential to cause serious disease. Disease severity is the product of several factors beyond the presence of the infectious agent, including specific host immune responses, host genetic makeup, and bacterial coinfections. To understand these interactions within natural infections, we designed a longitudinal cohort study actively surveilling respiratory viruses over the course of 19 months (2016 to 2018) in a diverse cohort in New York City. We integrated the molecular characterization of 800+ nasopharyngeal samples with clinical data from 104 participants. Transcriptomic data enabled the identification of respiratory pathogens in nasopharyngeal samples, the characterization of markers of immune response, the identification of signatures associated with symptom severity, individual viruses, and bacterial coinfections. Specific results include a rapid restoration of baseline conditions after infection, significant transcriptomic differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, and qualitatively similar responses across different viruses. We created an interactive computational resource (Virome Data Explorer) to facilitate access to the data and visualization of analytical results.",

Here, we introduce Smoother, a unified framework that integrates positional information into non-spatial models via modular priors and losses. In simulated and real datasets, Smoother enables accurate data imputation, cell-type deconvolution, and dimensionality reduction with remarkable efficiency. In colorectal cancer, Smoother-guided deconvolution reveals plasma cell and fibroblast subtype localizations linked to tumor microenvironment restructuring. Additionally, joint modeling of spatial and single-cell human prostate data with Smoother allows for spatial mapping of reference populations with significantly reduced ambiguity.",

The \u03baB-Ras proteins were previously shown to inhibit both NF-\u03baB and Ras activation through independent mechanisms, implicating them as tumor suppressors with potentially broad relevance to human cancers. In this study, we have used two mouse models to establish the relevance of the \u03baB-Ras proteins for tumorigenesis. Additionally, we have utilized a pan-cancer bioinformatics analysis to explore the role of the \u03baB-Ras proteins in human cancers. Surprisingly, we find that the genes encoding \u03baB-Ras 1 (",

        "Title": "Aberrant pace of cortical neuron development in brain organoids from patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and schizophrenia.",
        "Abstract": "Adults and children afflicted with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) exhibit cognitive, social, and emotional impairments, and are at significantly heightened risk for schizophrenia (SCZ). The impact of this deletion on early human brain development, however, has remained unclear. Here we harness organoid models of the developing human cerebral cortex, cultivated from subjects with 22q11.2DS and SCZ, as well as unaffected control samples, to identify cell-type-specific developmental abnormalities arising from this genomic lesion. Leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing in conjunction with experimental validation, we find that the loss of genes within the 22q11.2 locus leads to a delayed development of cortical neurons. This compromised development was reflected in an elevated proportion of actively proliferating neural progenitor cells, coupled with a decreased fraction of more mature neurons. Furthermore, we identify perturbed molecular imprints linked to neuronal maturation, observe the presence of sparser neurites, and note a blunted amplitude in glutamate-induced Ca2+ transients. The aberrant transcription program underlying impaired development contains molecular signatures significantly enriched in neuropsychiatric genetic liability. MicroRNA profiling and target gene investigation suggest that microRNA dysregulation may drive perturbations of genes governing the pace at which maturation unfolds. Using protein-protein interaction network analysis we define complementary effects stemming from additional genes residing within the deleted locus. Our study uncovers reproducible neurodevelopmental and molecular alterations due to 22q11.2 deletions. These findings have the potential to facilitate disease modeling and promote the pursuit of therapeutic interventions.",

        "Title": "Radiation therapy promotes unsaturated fatty acids to maintain survival of glioblastoma.",
        "Abstract": "Radiation therapy (RT) is essential for the management of glioblastoma (GBM). However, GBM frequently relapses within the irradiated margins, thus suggesting that RT might stimulate mechanisms of resistance that limits its efficacy. GBM is recognized for its metabolic plasticity, but whether RT-induced resistance relies on metabolic adaptation remains unclear. Here, we show in vitro and in vivo that irradiated GBM tumors switch their metabolic program to accumulate lipids, especially unsaturated fatty acids. This resulted in an increased formation of lipid droplets to prevent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The reduction of lipid accumulation with genetic suppression and pharmacological inhibition of the fatty acid synthase (FASN), one of the main lipogenic enzymes, leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased apoptosis of irradiated GBM cells. Combination of FASN inhibition with focal RT improved the median survival of GBM-bearing mice. Supporting the translational value of these findings, retrospective analysis of the GLASS consortium dataset of matched GBM patients revealed an enrichment in lipid metabolism signature in recurrent GBM compared to primary. Overall, these results demonstrate that RT drives GBM resistance by generating a lipogenic environment permissive to GBM survival. Targeting lipid metabolism might be required to develop more effective anti-GBM strategies.",

        "Abstract": "Insertions and deletions (indels) are common sources of structural variation, and insertions originating from spontaneous DNA lesions are frequent in cancer. We developed a highly sensitive assay called insertion and deletion sequencing (Indel-seq) to monitor rearrangements in human cells at the TRIM37 acceptor locus that reports indels stemming from experimentally induced and spontaneous genome instability. Templated insertions, which derive from sequences genome wide, require contact between donor and acceptor loci, require homologous recombination, and are stimulated by DNA end-processing. Insertions are facilitated by transcription and involve a DNA/RNA hybrid intermediate. Indel-seq reveals that insertions are generated via multiple pathways. The broken acceptor site anneals with a resected DNA break or invades the displaced strand of a transcription bubble or R-loop, followed by DNA synthesis, displacement, and then ligation by non-homologous end joining. Our studies identify transcription-coupled insertions as a critical source of spontaneous genome instability that is distinct from cut-and-paste events.",

        "Abstract": "The ATR kinase, which coordinates cellular responses to DNA replication stress, is also essential for the proliferation of normal unstressed cells. Although its role in the replication stress response is well defined, the mechanisms by which ATR supports normal cell proliferation remain elusive. Here, we show that ATR is dispensable for the viability of G0-arrested na\u00efve B cells. However, upon cytokine-induced proliferation, Atr-deficient B cells initiate DNA replication efficiently, but by mid-S phase they display dNTP depletion, fork stalling, and replication failure. Nonetheless, productive DNA replication and dNTP levels\u00a0can be restored in Atr-deficient cells by suppressing origin firing, such as partial inhibition of CDC7 and CDK1 kinase activities. Together, these findings indicate that ATR supports the proliferation of normal unstressed cells by tempering the pace of origin firing during the early S phase to avoid exhaustion of dNTPs and importantly also\u00a0other replication factors.",

        "Title": "ATR kinase supports normal proliferation in the early S phase by preventing replication resource exhaustion.",
        "Abstract": "The ATR kinase, which coordinates cellular responses to DNA replication stress, is also essential for the proliferation of normal unstressed cells. Although its role in the replication stress response is well defined, the mechanisms by which ATR supports normal cell proliferation remain elusive. Here, we show that ATR is dispensable for the viability of G0-arrested na\u00efve B cells. However, upon cytokine-induced proliferation, Atr-deficient B cells initiate DNA replication efficiently in early S phase, but by mid-S phase they display dNTP depletion, fork stalling, and replication failure. Nonetheless, productive DNA replication can be restored in Atr-deficient cells by pathways that suppress origin firing, such as downregulation of CDC7 and CDK1 kinase activities. Together, these findings indicate that ATR supports the proliferation of normal unstressed cells by tempering the pace of origin firing during the early S phase to avoid exhaustion of dNTPs and other replication factors.",

        "Abstract": "DNA transposable elements and transposase-derived genes are present in most living organisms, including vertebrates, but their function is largely unknown. PiggyBac Transposable Element Derived 5 (PGBD5) is an evolutionarily conserved vertebrate DNA transposase-derived gene with retained nuclease activity in cells. Vertebrate brain development is known to be associated with prominent neuronal cell death and DNA breaks, but their causes and functions are not well understood. Here, we show that PGBD5 contributes to normal brain development in mice and humans, where its deficiency causes disorder of intellectual disability, movement and seizures. In mice, Pgbd5 is required for the developmental induction of post-mitotic DNA breaks and recurrent somatic genome rearrangements in neurons. Together, these studies nominate PGBD5 as the long-hypothesized neuronal DNA nuclease required for brain function in mammals.",

        "Abstract": "Whereas the contribution of tumor microenvironment to the profound immune suppression of glioblastoma (GBM) is clear, tumor-cell intrinsic mechanisms that regulate resistance to CD8 T cell mediated killing are less understood. Kinases are potentially druggable targets that drive tumor progression and might influence immune response. Here, we perform an in vivo CRISPR screen to identify glioma intrinsic kinases that contribute to evasion of tumor cells from CD8 T cell recognition. The screen reveals checkpoint kinase 2 (Chek2) to be the most important kinase contributing to escape from CD8 T-cell recognition. Genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of Chek2 with blood-brain-barrier permeable drugs that are currently being evaluated in clinical trials, in combination with PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade, lead to survival benefit in multiple preclinical glioma models. Mechanistically, loss of Chek2 enhances antigen presentation, STING pathway activation and PD-L1 expression in mouse gliomas. Analysis of human GBMs demonstrates that Chek2 expression is inversely associated with antigen presentation and T-cell activation. Collectively, these results support Chek2 as a promising target for enhancement of response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in GBM.",

The incidence varies worldwide, with a majority affecting developing countries. Here, we present a comparative analysis of virus-positive and virus-negative tumors in nine cancers linked to five viruses. We find that virus-positive tumors occur more frequently in males and show geographical disparities in incidence. Genomic analysis of 1,658 tumors reveals virus-positive tumors exhibit distinct mutation signatures and driver gene mutations and possess a lower somatic mutation burden compared to virus-negative tumors of the same cancer type. For example, compared to the respective virus-negative counterparts, virus-positive cases across different cancer histologies had less often mutations of ",

While global deregulated expression of HLA-I has also been reported in different tumor types, the role of HLA-I allele-specific expression loss - that is, the preferential RNA expression loss of specific HLA-I alleles - has not been fully characterized in cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Nuclear actin-based movements have been shown to orchestrate clustering of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) into homology-directed repair domains. Here we describe multiscale three-dimensional genome reorganization following DNA damage and analyze the contribution of the nuclear WASP-ARP2/3-actin pathway toward chromatin topology alterations and pathologic repair. Hi-C analysis reveals genome-wide, DNA damage-induced chromatin compartment flips facilitated by ARP2/3 that enrich for open, A compartments. Damage promotes interactions between DSBs, which in turn facilitate aberrant, actin-dependent intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangements. Our work establishes that clustering of resected DSBs into repair domains by nuclear actin assembly is coordinated with multiscale alterations in genome architecture that enable homology-directed repair while also increasing nonhomologous end-joining-dependent translocation frequency.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have distant metastases have a poor prognosis. To determine which genomic factors of the primary tumor are associated with metastasis, we analyzed data from 759 patients originally diagnosed with stage I-III NSCLC as part of the AACR Project GENIE Biopharma Collaborative consortium. We found that TP53 mutations were significantly associated with the development of new distant metastases. TP53 mutations were also more prevalent in patients with a history of smoking, suggesting that these patients may be at increased risk for distant metastasis. Our results suggest that additional investigation of the optimal management of patients with early-stage NSCLC harboring TP53 mutations at diagnosis is warranted in light of their higher likelihood of developing new distant metastases.",

        "Abstract": "The factors driving therapy resistance in diffuse glioma remain poorly understood. To identify treatment-associated cellular and genetic changes, we analyzed RNA and/or DNA sequencing data from the temporally separated tumor pairs of 304 adult patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wild-type and IDH-mutant glioma. Tumors recurred in distinct manners that were dependent on IDH mutation status and attributable to changes in histological feature composition, somatic alterations, and microenvironment interactions. Hypermutation and acquired CDKN2A deletions were associated with an increase in proliferating neoplastic cells at recurrence in both glioma subtypes, reflecting active tumor growth. IDH-wild-type tumors were more invasive at recurrence, and their neoplastic cells exhibited increased expression of neuronal signaling programs that reflected a possible role for neuronal interactions in promoting glioma progression. Mesenchymal transition was associated with the presence of a myeloid cell state defined by specific ligand-receptor interactions with neoplastic cells. Collectively, these recurrence-associated phenotypes represent potential targets to alter disease progression.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have a grim prognosis despite complete surgical resection and intense systemic therapies. While immunotherapies have been beneficial with many different types of solid tumors, they have almost uniformly failed in the treatment of PDAC. Understanding how therapies affect the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) can provide insights for the development of strategies to treat PDAC. We used quantitative multiplexed immunofluorescence (qmIF) quantitative spatial analysis (qSA), and immunogenomic (IG) analysis to analyze formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) primary tumor specimens from 44 patients with PDAC including 18 treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) and 26 patients receiving no treatment (NT) and compared them with tissues from 40 treatment-na\u00efve melanoma patients. We find that relative to NT tumors, CD3",

        "Title": "Loss of PBRM1 Alters Promoter Histone Modifications and Activates ALDH1A1 to Drive Renal Cell Carcinoma.",
        "Abstract": "Subunits of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are frequently mutated in human malignancies. The PBAF complex is composed of multiple subunits, including the tumor-suppressor protein PBRM1 (BAF180), as well as ARID2 (BAF200), that are unique to this SWI/SNF complex. PBRM1 is mutated in various cancers, with a high mutation frequency in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Here, we integrate RNA-seq, histone modification ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq data to show that loss of PBRM1 results in de novo gains in H3K4me3 peaks throughout the epigenome, including activation of a retinoic acid biosynthesis and signaling gene signature. We show that one such target gene, ALDH1A1, which regulates a key step in retinoic acid biosynthesis, is consistently upregulated with PBRM1 loss in ccRCC cell lines and primary tumors, as well as non-malignant cells. We further find that ALDH1A1 increases the tumorigenic potential of ccRCC cells. Using biochemical methods, we show that ARID2 remains bound to other PBAF subunits after loss of PBRM1 and is essential for increased ALDH1A1 after loss of PBRM1, whereas other core SWI/SNF components are dispensable, including the ATPase subunit BRG1. In total, this study uses global epigenomic approaches to uncover novel mechanisms of PBRM1 tumor suppression in ccRCC.",

        "Abstract": "Only a subset of recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) responds to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Previously, we reported enrichment of BRAF/PTPN11 mutations in 30% of rGBM that responded to PD-1 blockade. Given that BRAF and PTPN11 promote MAPK/ERK signaling, we investigated whether activation of this pathway is associated with response to PD-1 inhibitors in rGBM, including patients that do not harbor BRAF/PTPN11 mutations. Here we show that immunohistochemistry for ERK1/2 phosphorylation (p-ERK), a marker of MAPK/ERK pathway activation, is predictive of overall survival following adjuvant PD-1 blockade in two independent rGBM patient cohorts. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and multiplex immunofluorescence analyses revealed that p-ERK was mainly localized in tumor cells and that high-p-ERK GBMs contained tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells and microglia with elevated expression of MHC class\u2009II and associated genes. These findings indicate that ERK1/2 activation in rGBM is predictive of response to PD-1 blockade and is associated with a distinct myeloid cell phenotype.",

        "Abstract": "Remodeling of the microenvironment by tumor cells can activate pathways that favor cancer growth. Molecular delineation and targeting of such malignant-cell nonautonomous pathways may help overcome resistance to targeted therapies. Herein we leverage genetic mouse models, patient-derived xenografts, and patient samples to show that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exploits peripheral serotonin signaling to remodel the endosteal niche to its advantage. AML progression requires the presence of serotonin receptor 1B (HTR1B) in osteoblasts and is driven by AML-secreted kynurenine, which acts as an oncometabolite and HTR1B ligand. AML cells utilize kynurenine to induce a proinflammatory state in osteoblasts that, through the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA), acts in a positive feedback loop on leukemia cells by increasing expression of IDO1-the rate-limiting enzyme for kynurenine synthesis-thereby enabling AML progression. This leukemia-osteoblast cross-talk, conferred by the kynurenine-HTR1B-SAA-IDO1 axis, could be exploited as a niche-focused therapeutic approach against AML, opening new avenues for cancer treatment.",

In the betacoronavirus genus, which also includes SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination frequently encompasses the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein, which is responsible for viral binding to host cell receptors. In this work, we reconstruct the evolutionary events that have accompanied the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, with a special emphasis on the RBD and its adaptation for binding to its receptor, human ACE2.",

Progression-free survival (PFS), time to treatment discontinuation (TTD), and time to next treatment (TTNT) are alternative end points, but their utility as surrogates for OS in real-world clinicogenomic data sets has not been well characterized.",

        "Abstract": "Here, we identify iPLA2\u03b2 as a critical regulator for p53-driven ferroptosis upon reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress. The calcium-independent phospholipase iPLA2\u03b2 is known to cleave acyl tails from the glycerol backbone of lipids and release oxidized fatty acids from phospholipids. We found that iPLA2\u03b2-mediated detoxification of peroxidized lipids is sufficient to suppress p53-driven ferroptosis upon ROS-induced stress, even in GPX4-null cells. Moreover, iPLA2\u03b2 is overexpressed in human cancers; inhibition of endogenous iPLA2\u03b2 sensitizes tumor cells to p53-driven ferroptosis and promotes p53-dependent tumor suppression in xenograft mouse models. These results demonstrate that iPLA2\u03b2 acts as a major ferroptosis repressor in a GPX4-independent manner. Notably, unlike GPX4, loss of iPLA2\u03b2 has no obvious effect on normal development or cell viability in normal tissues but iPLA2\u03b2 plays an essential role in regulating ferroptosis upon ROS-induced stress. Thus, our study suggests that iPLA2\u03b2 is a promising therapeutic target for activating ferroptosis-mediated tumor suppression without serious toxicity concerns.",

Here we show that, across B cell lymphomas, loss of MHC-I, but not MHC-II, is preferentially restricted to DLBCL.

        "Abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are a poorly characterized cell population in the context of liver cancer. Our study investigates CAF functions in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a highly desmoplastic liver tumor. Genetic tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and ligand-receptor analyses uncovered hepatic stellate cells (HSC) as the main source of CAF and HSC-derived CAF as the dominant population interacting with tumor cells. In mice, CAF promotes ICC progression, as revealed by HSC-selective CAF depletion. In patients, a high panCAF signature is associated with decreased survival and increased recurrence. Single-cell RNA sequencing segregates CAF into inflammatory and growth factor-enriched (iCAF) and myofibroblastic (myCAF) subpopulations, displaying distinct ligand-receptor interactions. myCAF-expressed hyaluronan synthase 2, but not type I collagen, promotes ICC. iCAF-expressed hepatocyte growth factor enhances ICC growth via tumor-expressed MET, thus directly linking CAF to tumor cells. In summary, our data demonstrate promotion of desmoplastic ICC growth by therapeutically targetable CAF subtype-specific mediators, but not by type I collagen.",

        "Abstract": "Multi-agent combination chemotherapy can be curative in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Still, patients with primary refractory disease or with relapsed leukemia have a very poor prognosis. Here we integrate an in-depth dissection of the mutational landscape across diagnostic and relapsed pediatric and adult ALL samples with genome-wide CRISPR screen analysis of gene-drug interactions across seven ALL chemotherapy drugs. By combining these analyses, we uncover diagnostic and relapse-specific mutational mechanisms as well as genetic drivers of chemoresistance. Functionally, our data identifies common and drug-specific pathways modulating chemotherapy response and underscores the effect of drug combinations in restricting the selection of resistance-driving genetic lesions. In addition, by identifying actionable targets for the reversal of chemotherapy resistance, these analyses open novel therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of relapse and refractory disease.",

Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is a pleiotropic kinase that acts as a key effector downstream of PI3K in many cell types. In T cells, PDK1 has been shown to be critical for activation of NF-\u03baB and AKT signaling upon TCR ligation and is therefore essential for effector T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production. Using Treg cell-specific conditional deletion, we now demonstrate that PDK1 is also essential for Treg cell suppressive activity in vivo. Ablation of ",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in DNA damage response (DDR) genes endanger genome integrity and predispose to cancer and genetic disorders. Here, using CRISPR-dependent cytosine base editing screens, we identify > 2,000 sgRNAs that generate nucleotide variants in 86 DDR genes, resulting in altered cellular fitness upon DNA damage. Among those variants, we discover loss- and gain-of-function mutants in the Tudor domain of the DDR regulator 53BP1 that define a non-canonical surface required for binding the deubiquitinase USP28. Moreover, we characterize variants of the TRAIP ubiquitin ligase that define a domain, whose loss renders cells resistant to topoisomerase I inhibition. Finally, we identify mutations in the ATM kinase with opposing genome stability phenotypes and loss-of-function mutations in the CHK2 kinase previously categorized as variants of uncertain significance for breast cancer. We anticipate that this resource will enable the discovery of additional DDR gene functions and expedite studies of DDR variants in human disease.",

        "Abstract": "Viral recombination is a major evolutionary mechanism driving adaptation processes, such as the ability of host-switching. Understanding global patterns of recombination could help to identify underlying mechanisms and to evaluate the potential risks of rapid adaptation. Conventional approaches (e.g., those based on linkage disequilibrium) are computationally demanding or even intractable when sequence alignments include hundreds of sequences, common in viral data sets. We present a comprehensive analysis of recombination across 30 genomic alignments from viruses infecting humans. In order to scale the analysis and avoid the computational limitations of conventional approaches, we apply newly developed topological data analysis methods able to infer recombination rates for large data sets. We show that viruses, such as ZEBOV and MARV, consistently displayed low levels of recombination, whereas high levels of recombination were observed in Sarbecoviruses, HBV, HEV, Rhinovirus A, and HIV. We observe that recombination is more common in positive single-stranded RNA viruses than in negatively single-stranded RNA ones. Interestingly, the comparison across multiple viruses suggests an inverse correlation between genome length and recombination rate. Positional analyses of recombination breakpoints along viral genomes, combined with our approach, detected at least 39 nonuniform patterns of recombination (i.e., cold or hotspots) in 18 viral groups. Among these, noteworthy hotspots are found in MERS-CoV and Sarbecoviruses (at spike, Nucleocapsid and ORF8). In summary, we have developed a fast pipeline to measure recombination that, combined with other approaches, has allowed us to find both common and lineage-specific patterns of recombination among viruses with potential relevance in viral adaptation.",

        "Abstract": "Technological and computational advances in genomics and interactomics have made it possible to identify how disease mutations perturb protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks within human cells. Here, we show that disease-associated germline variants are significantly enriched in sequences encoding PPI interfaces compared to variants identified in healthy participants from the projects 1000\u2009Genomes and ExAC. Somatic missense mutations are also significantly enriched in PPI interfaces compared to noninterfaces in 10,861\u2009tumor exomes. We computationally identified 470\u2009putative oncoPPIs in a pan-cancer analysis and demonstrate that oncoPPIs are highly correlated with patient survival and drug resistance/sensitivity. We experimentally validate the network effects of 13\u2009oncoPPIs using a systematic binary interaction assay, and also demonstrate the functional consequences of two of these on tumor cell growth. In summary, this human interactome network framework provides a powerful tool for prioritization of alleles with PPI-perturbing mutations to inform pathobiological mechanism- and genotype-based therapeutic discovery.",

        "Abstract": "Personalized cancer treatments based on the molecular profile of a patient's tumor are an emerging and exciting class of treatments in oncology. As genomic tumor profiling is becoming more common, targeted treatments for specific molecular alterations are gaining traction. To discover new potential therapeutics that may apply to broad classes of tumors matching some molecular pattern, experimentalists and pharmacologists rely on high-throughput, in vitro screens of many compounds against many different cell lines. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model of how cancer cell lines respond to drugs in these experiments and develop a method for fitting the model to real-world high-throughput screening data. Through a case study, the model is shown to capture nontrivial associations between molecular features and drug response, such as requiring both wild type TP53 and overexpression of MDM2 to be sensitive to Nutlin-3(a). In quantitative benchmarks, the model outperforms a standard approach in biology, with $\\approx20\\%$ lower predictive error on held out data. When combined with a conditional randomization testing procedure, the model discovers markers of therapeutic response that recapitulate known biology and suggest new avenues for investigation.

        "Abstract": "Cancer cells develop strong genetic dependencies, enabling survival under oncogenic stress. MYC is a key oncogene activated across most cancers, and identifying associated synthetic lethality or sickness can provide important clues about its activity and potential therapeutic strategies. On the basis of previously conducted genome-wide screenings in MCF10A cells expressing MYC fused to an estrogen receptor fragment, we identified UVSSA, a gene involved in transcription-coupled repair, whose knockdown or knockout decreased cell viability when combined with MYC expression. Synthetic sick interactions between MYC expression and UVSSA down-regulation correlated with ATM/CHK2 activation, suggesting increased genome instability. We show that the synthetic sick interaction is diminished by attenuating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity; yet, it is independent of UV-induced damage repair, suggesting that UVSSA has a critical function in regulating RNAPII in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. Supporting this hypothesis, RNAPII ChIP-seq revealed that MYC-dependent increases in RNAPII promoter occupancy are reduced or abrogated by UVSSA knockdown, suggesting that UVSSA influences RNAPII dynamics during MYC-dependent transcription. Taken together, our data show that the UVSSA complex has a significant function in supporting MYC-dependent RNAPII dynamics and maintaining cell survival during MYC addiction. While the role of UVSSA in regulating RNAPII has been documented thus far only in the context of UV-induced DNA damage repair, we propose that its activity is also required to cope with transcriptional changes induced by oncogene activation.",

        "Abstract": "Analyzing data from large-scale, multi-experiment studies requires scientists to both analyze each experiment and to assess the results as a whole. In this article, we develop double empirical Bayes testing (DEBT), an empirical Bayes method for analyzing multi-experiment studies when many covariates are gathered per experiment. DEBT is a two-stage method: in the first stage, it reports which experiments yielded significant outcomes; in the second stage, it hypothesizes which covariates drive the experimental significance. In both of its stages, DEBT builds on Efron (2008), which lays out an elegant empirical Bayes approach to testing. DEBT enhances this framework by learning a series of black box predictive models to boost power and control the false discovery rate (FDR). In Stage 1, it uses a deep neural network prior to report which experiments yielded significant outcomes. In Stage 2, it uses an empirical Bayes version of the knockoff filter (Candes et al., 2018) to select covariates that have significant predictive power of Stage-1 significance. In both simulated and real data, DEBT increases the proportion of discovered significant outcomes and selects more features when signals are weak. In a real study of cancer cell lines, DEBT selects a robust set of biologically-plausible genomic drivers of drug sensitivity and resistance in cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Single-cell technologies provide the opportunity to identify new cellular states. However, a major obstacle to the identification of biological signals is noise in single-cell data. In addition, single-cell data are very sparse. We propose a new method based on random matrix theory to analyze and denoise single-cell sequencing data. The method uses the universal distributions predicted by random matrix theory for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of random covariance/Wishart matrices to distinguish noise from signal. In addition, we explain how sparsity can cause spurious eigenvector localization, falsely identifying meaningful directions in the data. We show that roughly 95% of the information in single-cell data is compatible with the predictions of random matrix theory, about 3% is spurious signal induced by sparsity, and only the last 2% reflects true biological signal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing with alternative techniques in a variety of examples with marked cell populations.",

Here we identify midkine (MDK) as a melanoma-secreted driver of an inflamed, but immune evasive, microenvironment that defines poor patient prognosis and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. Mechanistically, MDK was found to control the transcriptome of melanoma cells, allowing for coordinated activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB and downregulation of interferon-associated pathways. The resulting MDK-modulated secretome educated macrophages towards tolerant phenotypes that promoted CD8",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in the core RNA splicing factor SF3B1 are prevalent in leukemias and uveal melanoma, but hotspot SF3B1 mutations are also seen in epithelial malignancies such as breast cancer. Although hotspot mutations in SF3B1 alter hematopoietic differentiation, whether SF3B1 mutations contribute to epithelial cancer development and progression is unknown. Here, we identify that SF3B1 mutations in mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells induce a recurrent pattern of aberrant splicing leading to activation of AKT and NF-\u03baB, enhanced cell migration, and accelerated tumorigenesis. Transcriptomic analysis of human cancer specimens, MMTV-cre Sf3b1K700E/WT mice, and isogenic mutant cell lines identified hundreds of aberrant 3' splice sites (3'ss) induced by mutant SF3B1. Consistently between mouse and human tumors, mutant SF3B1 promoted aberrant splicing (dependent on aberrant branchpoints as well as pyrimidines downstream of the cryptic 3'ss) and consequent suppression of PPP2R5A and MAP3K7, critical negative regulators of AKT and NF-\u03baB. Coordinate activation of NF-\u03baB and AKT signaling was observed in the knockin models, leading to accelerated cell migration and tumor development in combination with mutant PIK3CA but also hypersensitizing cells to AKT kinase inhibitors. These data identify hotspot mutations in SF3B1 as an important contributor to breast tumorigenesis and reveal unique vulnerabilities in cancers harboring them.",

        "Abstract": "To generate antibodies with different effector functions, B cells undergo Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain (IgH) class switch recombination (CSR). The ligation step of CSR is usually mediated by the classical nonhomologous end-joining (cNHEJ) pathway. In cNHEJ-deficient cells, a remarkable \u223c25% of CSR can be achieved by the alternative end-joining (Alt-EJ) pathway that preferentially uses microhomology (MH) at the junctions. While A-EJ-mediated repair of endonuclease-generated breaks requires DNA end resection, we show that CtIP-mediated DNA end resection is dispensable for A-EJ-mediated CSR using cNHEJ-deficient B cells. High-throughput sequencing analyses revealed that loss of ATM/ATR phosphorylation of CtIP at T855 or ATM kinase inhibition suppresses resection without altering the MH pattern of the A-EJ-mediated switch junctions. Moreover, we found that ATM kinase promotes Alt-EJ-mediated CSR by suppressing interchromosomal translocations independent of end resection. Finally, temporal analyses reveal that MHs are enriched in early internal deletions even in cNHEJ-proficient B cells. Thus, we propose that repetitive IgH switch regions represent favored substrates for MH-mediated end-joining contributing to the robustness and resection independence of A-EJ-mediated CSR.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the cellular constituents of the prostate is essential for identifying the cell of origin for prostate adenocarcinoma. Here, we describe a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the adult mouse prostate epithelium, which displays extensive heterogeneity. We observe distal lobe-specific luminal epithelial populations (LumA, LumD, LumL, and LumV), a proximally enriched luminal population (LumP) that is not lobe-specific, and a periurethral population (PrU) that shares both basal and luminal features. Functional analyses suggest that LumP and PrU cells have multipotent progenitor activity in organoid formation and tissue reconstitution assays. Furthermore, we show that mouse distal and proximal luminal cells are most similar to human acinar and ductal populations, that a PrU-like population is conserved between species, and that the mouse lateral prostate is most similar to the human peripheral zone. Our findings elucidate new prostate epithelial progenitors, and help resolve long-standing questions about anatomical relationships between the mouse and human prostate.",

        "Abstract": "Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent used for the treatment of glioblastoma and is now becoming a chemotherapeutic option in patients diagnosed with high-risk low-grade gliomas. The O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is responsible for the direct repair of the main TMZ-induced toxic DNA adduct, the O6-Methylguanine lesion. MGMT promoter hypermethylation is currently the only known biomarker for TMZ response in glioblastoma patients. Here we show that a subset of recurrent gliomas carries MGMT genomic rearrangements that lead to MGMT overexpression, independently from changes in its promoter methylation. By leveraging the CRISPR/Cas9 technology we generated some of these MGMT rearrangements in glioma cells and demonstrated that the MGMT genomic rearrangements contribute to TMZ resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Lastly, we showed that such fusions can be detected in tumor-derived exosomes and could potentially represent an early detection marker of tumor recurrence in a subset of patients treated with TMZ.",

While some such mutations are recurrently found in many tumors, many others exist solely within a few samples, precluding detection by conventional recurrence-based statistical approaches. Integrated analysis of somatic mutations and RNA expression data across 12 tumor types reveals that mutations of cancer genes are usually accompanied by substantial changes in expression. We use topological data analysis to leverage this observation and uncover 38 elusive candidate cancer-associated genes, including inactivating mutations of the metalloproteinase ADAMTS12 in lung adenocarcinoma.

        "Abstract": "Breast implant-associated lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) has recently been recognized as an independent peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) entity. In this study, we generated the first BIA-ALCL patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) model (IL89) and a matching continuous cell line (IL89_CL#3488) to discover potential vulnerabilities and druggable targets. We characterized IL89 and IL89_CL#3488, both phenotypically and genotypically, and demonstrated that they closely resemble the matching human primary lymphoma. The tumor content underwent significant enrichment along passages, as confirmed by the increased variant allele frequency (VAF) of mutations. Known aberrations (JAK1 and KMT2C) were identified, together with novel hits, including PDGFB, PDGFRA, and SETBP1. A deep sequencing approach allowed the detection of mutations below the Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) sensitivity threshold, including JAK1G1097D, in the primary sample. RNA sequencing confirmed the expression of a signature of differentially expressed genes in BIA-ALCL. Next, we tested IL89's sensitivity to the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib and observed a potent anti-tumor effect, both in vitro and in vivo. We also implemented a high-throughput drug screening approach to identify compounds associated with increased responses in the presence of ruxolitinib. In conclusion, these new IL89 BIA-ALCL models closely recapitulate the primary correspondent lymphoma and represent an informative platform for dissecting the molecular features of BIA-ALCL and performing pre-clinical drug discovery studies, fostering the development of new precision medicine approaches.",

        "Abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 underscores the need to better understand the evolutionary processes that drive the emergence and adaptation of zoonotic viruses in humans. In the betacoronavirus genus, which also includes SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike protein, which, in turn, is responsible for viral binding to host cell receptors. Here, we find evidence of a recombination event in the RBD involving ancestral linages to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Although we cannot specify the recombinant nor the parental strains, likely due to the ancestry of the event and potential undersampling, our statistical analyses in the space of phylogenetic trees support such an ancestral recombination. Consequently, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share an RBD sequence that includes two insertions (positions 432-436 and 460-472), as well as the variants 427N and 436Y. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that interacts directly with the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor. Reconstruction of ancestral states, combined with protein-binding affinity analyses using the physics-based trRosetta algorithm, reveal that the recombination event involving ancestral strains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 led to an increased affinity for hACE2 binding, and that alleles 427N and 436Y significantly enhanced affinity as well. Structural modeling indicates that ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 may have acquired the ability to infect humans decades ago. The binding affinity with the human receptor was subsequently boosted in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through further mutations in RBD. In sum, we report an ancestral recombination event affecting the RBD of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that was associated with an increased binding affinity to hACE2.",

        "Abstract": "The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex is necessary for antigen presentation and regulates both innate and adaptive immune responses. In the context of cancer and treatment therapies, the HLA locus plays a critical role in tumor recognition and tolerance mechanisms. In silico HLA class I and class II typing, as well as expression quantification from next-generation RNA sequencing, can therefore have great potential clinical applications. However, HLA typing from short-read data is a challenging task given the high polymorphism and homology at the HLA locus. In this chapter, we present our highly accurate HLA typing solution, arcasHLA. We provide a detailed outline for practitioners using our protocol to perform HLA typing and demonstrate the applicability of arcasHLA in several clinical samples from tumors.",

        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain tumor with few treatment options. The survival of glioma-initiating cells (GICs) is one of the major factors contributing to treatment failure. GICs frequently produce and respond to their own growth factors that support cell proliferation and survival. In this study, we aimed to identify critical autocrine factors mediating GIC survival and to evaluate the anti-GBM effect of antagonizing these factors. Proteomic analysis was performed using conditioned media from two different patient-derived GBM tumor spheres under a growth factor-depleted status. Then, the antitumor effects of inhibiting an identified autocrine factor were evaluated by bioinformatic analysis and molecular validation. Proteins secreted by sphere-forming GICs promote cell proliferation/survival and detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS). Among these proteins, we focused on midkine (MDK) as a clinically significant and pathologically relevant autocrine factor. Antagonizing MDK reduced the survival of GBM tumor spheres through the promotion of cell cycle arrest and the consequent apoptotic cell death caused by oxidative stress-induced DNA damage. We also identified PCBP4, a novel molecular predictor of resistance to anti-MDK treatment. Collectively, our results indicate that MDK inhibition is an important therapeutic option by suppressing GIC survival through the induction of ROS-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.",

        "Abstract": "Many studies have highlighted the role of dysregulated glucagon secretion in the etiology of hyperglycemia and diabetes. Accordingly, understanding the mechanisms underlying pancreatic islet \u03b1 cell development and function has important implications for the discovery of new therapies for diabetes. In this study, comparative transcriptome analyses between embryonic mouse pancreas and adult mouse islets identified several pancreatic lncRNAs that lie in close proximity to essential pancreatic transcription factors, including the Pax6-associated lncRNA Paupar. We demonstrate that Paupar is enriched in glucagon-producing \u03b1 cells where it promotes the alternative splicing of Pax6 to an isoform required for activation of essential \u03b1 cell genes. Consistently, deletion of Paupar in mice resulted in dysregulation of PAX6 \u03b1 cell target genes and corresponding \u03b1 cell dysfunction, including blunted glucagon secretion. These findings illustrate a distinct mechanism by which a pancreatic lncRNA can coordinate glucose homeostasis by cell-specific regulation of a broadly expressed transcription factor.",

        "Abstract": "SF3B1, which encodes an essential spliceosomal protein, is frequently mutated in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and many cancers. However, the defect of mutant SF3B1 is unknown. Here, we analyzed RNA sequencing data from MDS patients and confirmed that SF3B1 mutants use aberrant 3' splice sites. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we purified complexes containing either wild-type or the hotspot K700E mutant SF3B1 and found that levels of a poorly studied spliceosomal protein, SUGP1, were reduced in mutant spliceosomes. Strikingly, SUGP1 knockdown completely recapitulated the splicing errors, whereas SUGP1 overexpression drove the protein, which our data suggest plays an important role in branchsite recognition, into the mutant spliceosome and partially rescued splicing. Other hotspot SF3B1 mutants showed similar altered splicing and diminished interaction with SUGP1. Our study demonstrates that SUGP1 loss is a common defect of spliceosomes with disease-causing SF3B1 mutations and, because this defect can be rescued, suggests possibilities for therapeutic intervention.",

Here, we implement an in silico computational framework (pathogen host interactome prediction using structure similarity [P-HIPSTer]) that employs structural information to predict \u223c282,000 pan viral-human PPIs with an experimental validation rate of \u223c76%. In addition to rediscovering known biology, P-HIPSTer has yielded a series of new findings: the discovery of shared and unique machinery employed across human-infecting viruses, a likely role for ZIKV-ESR1 interactions in modulating viral replication, the identification of PPIs that discriminate between human papilloma viruses (HPVs) with high and low oncogenic potential, and a structure-enabled history of evolutionary selective pressure imposed on the human proteome. Further, P-HIPSTer enables discovery of previously unappreciated cellular circuits that act on human-infecting viruses and provides insight into experimentally intractable viruses.",

        "Abstract": "To repurpose compounds for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we screened a library of drugs and other targeted compounds approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on 9 cell lines and validated the results on a panel of 32 genetically characterized DLBCL cell lines. Dasatinib, a multikinase inhibitor, was effective against 50% of DLBCL cell lines, as well as against in vivo xenografts. Dasatinib was more broadly active than the Bruton kinase inhibitor ibrutinib and overcame ibrutinib resistance. Tumors exhibiting dasatinib resistance were commonly characterized by activation of the PI3K pathway and loss of PTEN expression as a specific biomarker. PI3K suppression by mTORC2 inhibition synergized with dasatinib and abolished resistance in vitro and in vivo. These results provide a proof of concept for the repurposing approach in DLBCL, and point to dasatinib as an attractive strategy for further clinical development in lymphomas.",

        "Abstract": "Whether the nom de guerre is Mathematical Oncology, Computational or Systems Biology, Theoretical Biology, Evolutionary Oncology, Bioinformatics, or simply Basic Science, there is no denying that mathematics continues to play an increasingly prominent role in cancer research. Mathematical Oncology-defined here simply as the use of mathematics in cancer research-complements and overlaps with a number of other fields that rely on mathematics as a core methodology. As a result, Mathematical Oncology has a broad scope, ranging from theoretical studies to clinical trials designed with mathematical models. This Roadmap differentiates Mathematical Oncology from related fields and demonstrates specific areas of focus within this unique field of research. The dominant theme of this Roadmap is the personalization of medicine through mathematics, modelling, and simulation. This is achieved through the use of patient-specific clinical data to: develop individualized screening strategies to detect cancer earlier; make predictions of response to therapy; design adaptive, patient-specific treatment plans to overcome therapy resistance; and establish domain-specific standards to share model predictions and to make models and simulations reproducible. The cover art for this Roadmap was chosen as an apt metaphor for the beautiful, strange, and evolving relationship between mathematics and cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Five-year survival for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients remains below 7% due to the lack of effective treatments. Here, we report that combined ablation of EGFR and c-RAF expression results in complete regression of a significant percentage of PDAC tumors driven by Kras/Trp53 mutations in genetically engineered mice. Moreover, systemic elimination of these targets induces toxicities that are well tolerated. Response to this targeted therapy correlates with transcriptional profiles that resemble those observed in human PDACs. Finally, inhibition of EGFR and c-RAF expression effectively blocked tumor progression in nine independent patient-derived xenografts carrying KRAS and TP53 mutations. These results open the door to the development of targeted therapies for PDAC patients.",

        "Abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been successful across several tumor types; however, their efficacy has been uncommon and unpredictable in glioblastomas (GBM), where <10% of patients show long-term responses. To understand the molecular determinants of immunotherapeutic response in GBM, we longitudinally profiled 66 patients, including 17 long-term responders, during standard therapy and after treatment with PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab or pembrolizumab). Genomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant enrichment of PTEN mutations associated with immunosuppressive expression signatures in non-responders, and an enrichment of MAPK pathway alterations (PTPN11, BRAF) in responders. Responsive tumors were also associated with branched patterns of evolution from the elimination of neoepitopes as well as with differences in T cell clonal diversity and tumor microenvironment profiles. Our study shows that clinical response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in GBM is associated with specific molecular alterations, immune expression signatures, and immune infiltration that reflect the tumor's clonal evolution during treatment.",

Although many readthrough events have been previously discovered in Nature, a broader description of the stimulatory RNA signals would help to identify new reprogramming events in eukaryotic genes and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of readthrough. Here, we explore the RNA reprogramming landscape by performing in vitro translation selections to enrich RNA readthrough signals de novo from a starting randomized library comprising >10",

        "Title": "Hypermutagenesis in untreated adult gliomas due to inherited mismatch mutations.",
        "Abstract": "Hypermutagenesis refers to marked increase in the number of mutations due to continuous mutagenic process. Hypermutated tumors, have being found in several tumor types, are associated with inherited or acquired alterations in the DNA repair pathways. Hypermutation has been observed in a subset of adult glioma patients as a direct result of temozolomide(TMZ)-induced mutagenesis. In our study, we have identified a rare subset of treatment-na\u00efve adult gliomas with de novo hypermutator phenotype and explored the evolution of spontaneous and treatment-induced hypermutagenesis. We conducted Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES), Whole-Transcriptome Sequencing (WTS), and Single-Cell Sequencing (SCS) of TMZ-na\u00efve and post-TMZ-treated hypermutated tumors to identify distinct clinical or genomic manifestations that contribute to the development of hypermutation in untreated adult gliomas. TMZ-na\u00efve hypermutated tumors were marked by absence of IDH1 somatic mutation and MGMT promoter (pMGMT) methylation, two genomic traits that were significantly associated with the TMZ-induced hypermutagenic event in glioblastoma, and harbored inherited alterations in the mismatch repair (MMR) machinery. The immediate family members of the TMZ-naive hypermutated glioma patients were also previous diagnosed with cancer development history, suggesting that germline dysfunction of the MMR pathway could potentially pose hereditary risk to genetic predisposition of carcinogenesis in gliomas. Lastly, both TMZ-na\u00efve and post-TMZ-treated hypermutated tumors exhibited a significant accumulation of neoantigen loads, suggesting immunotherapeutic alternatives. Our results present new and unique understanding of hypermutagenic process in adult gliomas and an important step towards clinical implication of immunotherapy in glioma treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Outcomes of anticancer therapy vary dramatically among patients due to diverse genetic and molecular backgrounds, highlighting extensive intertumoral heterogeneity. The fundamental tenet of precision oncology defines molecular characterization of tumors to guide optimal patient-tailored therapy. Towards this goal, we have established a compilation of pharmacological landscapes of 462 patient-derived tumor cells (PDCs) across 14 cancer types, together with genomic and transcriptomic profiling in 385 of these tumors. Compared with the traditional long-term cultured cancer cell line models, PDCs recapitulate the molecular properties and biology of the diseases more precisely. Here, we provide insights into dynamic pharmacogenomic associations, including molecular determinants that elicit therapeutic resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and the potential repurposing of ibrutinib (currently used in hematological malignancies) for EGFR-specific therapy in gliomas. Lastly, we present a potential implementation of PDC-derived drug sensitivities for the prediction of clinical response to targeted therapeutics using retrospective clinical studies.",

        "Abstract": "One cause of cancer mortality is tumor evolution to therapy-resistant disease. First line therapy often targets the dominant clone, and drug resistance can emerge from preexisting clones that gain fitness through therapy-induced natural selection. Such mutations may be identified using targeted sequencing assays by analysis of noise in high-depth data. Here, we develop a comprehensive, unbiased model for sequencing error background. We find that noise in sufficiently deep DNA sequencing data can be approximated by aggregating negative binomial distributions. Mutations with frequencies above noise may have prognostic value. We evaluate our model with simulated exponentially expanded populations as well as data from cell line and patient sample dilution experiments, demonstrating its utility in prognosticating tumor progression. Our results may have the potential to identify significant mutations that can cause recurrence. These results are relevant in the pre-treatment clinical setting to determine appropriate therapy and prepare for potential recurrence pretreatment.",

        "Abstract": "The relationship between anti-tumoral immunity and cancer progression is complex. Recently, immune editing has emerged as a model to explain the interplay between the immune system and the selection of genetic alterations in cancer. In this model, the immune system selects cancer cells that grow as these are fit to escape immune surveillance during tumor development. Gliomas and glioblastoma, the most aggressive and most common of all primary malignant brain tumors are genetically heterogeneous, are relatively less antigenic, and are less responsive to immunotherapy than other cancers. In this review, we provide an overview of the relationship between glioma\u00b4s immune suppressive features, anti-tumoral immunity and cancer genomics. In this context, we provide a critical discussion of evidence suggestive of immune editing in this disease and discuss possible alternative explanations for these findings.",

        "Abstract": "Bats harbor many viruses asymptomatically, including several notorious for causing extreme virulence in humans. To identify differences between antiviral mechanisms in humans and bats, we sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the genome of Rousettus aegyptiacus, a natural reservoir of Marburg virus and the only known reservoir for any filovirus. We found an expanded and diversified KLRC/KLRD family of natural killer cell receptors, MHC class I genes, and type I interferons, which dramatically differ from their functional counterparts in other mammals. Such concerted evolution of key components of bat immunity is strongly suggestive of novel modes of antiviral defense. An evaluation of the theoretical function of these genes suggests that an inhibitory immune state may exist in bats. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that tolerance of viral infection, rather than enhanced potency of antiviral defenses, may be a key mechanism by which bats asymptomatically host viruses that are pathogenic in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor prognosis. Gain-of-function mutations in the 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic II (NT5C2) gene induce resistance to 6-mercaptopurine and are selectively present in relapsed ALL. Yet, the mechanisms involved in NT5C2 mutation-driven clonal evolution during the initiation of leukaemia, disease progression and relapse remain unknown. Here we use a conditional-and-inducible leukaemia model to demonstrate that expression of NT5C2(R367Q), a highly prevalent relapsed-ALL NT5C2 mutation, induces resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine at the cost of impaired leukaemia cell growth and leukaemia-initiating cell activity.

        "Title": "Precision Medicine for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Redefining AKI by Agnostic Kidney Tissue Interrogation and Genetics.",
        "Abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) currently is diagnosed by a temporal trend of a single blood analyte: serum creatinine. This measurement is neither sensitive nor specific to kidney injury or its protean forms. Newer biomarkers, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL, Lipocalin 2, Siderocalin), or kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1, Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 1), accelerate the diagnosis of AKI as well as prospectively distinguish rapidly reversible from prolonged causes of serum creatinine increase. Nonetheless, these biomarkers lack the capacity to subfractionate AKI further (eg, sepsis versus ischemia versus nephrotoxicity from medications, enzymes, or metals) or inform us about the primary and secondary sites of injury. It also is unknown whether all nephrons are injured in AKI, whether all cells in a nephron are affected, and whether injury responses can be stimulus-specific or cell type-specific or both. In this review, we summarize fully agnostic tissue interrogation approaches that may help to redefine AKI in cellular and molecular terms, including single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing technology. These approaches will empower a shift in the current paradigm of AKI diagnosis, classification, and staging, and provide the renal community with a significant advance toward precision medicine in the analysis AKI.",

However, integrated germline and somatic analysis remains uncommon. We present a framework that uses machine learning to learn features of recurrent somatic mutations to (1) predict somatic variants from tumor-only samples and (2) identify somatic-like germline variants for integrated analysis of tumor-normal DNA. Using data from 1769 patients from seven cancer types (bladder, glioblastoma, low-grade glioma, lung, melanoma, stomach, and pediatric glioma), we show that \"somatic-like\" germline variants are enriched for autosomal-dominant cancer-predisposition genes (",

        "Abstract": "A taxonomy is a standardized framework to classify and organize items into categories. Hierarchical taxonomies are ubiquitous, ranging from the classification of organisms to the file system on a computer. Characterizing the typical distribution of items within taxonomic categories is an important question with applications in many disciplines. Ecologists have long sought to account for the patterns observed in species-abundance distributions (the number of individuals per species found in some sample), and computer scientists study the distribution of files per directory. Is there a universal statistical distribution describing how many items are typically found in each category in large taxonomies? Here, we analyze a wide array of large, real-world datasets - including items lost and found on the New York City transit system, library books, and a bacterial microbiome - and discover such an underlying commonality. A simple, non-parametric branching model that randomly categorizes items and takes as input only the total number of items and the total number of categories is quite successful in reproducing the observed abundance distributions. This result may shed light on patterns in species-abundance distributions long observed in ecology. The model also predicts the number of taxonomic categories that remain unrepresented in a finite sample.",

        "Abstract": "To ensure the completion of DNA replication and maintenance of genome integrity, DNA repair factors protect stalled replication forks upon replication stress. Previous studies have identified a critical role for the tumor suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2 in preventing the degradation of nascent DNA by the MRE11 nuclease after replication stress. Here we show that depletion of SMARCAL1, a SNF2-family DNA translocase that remodels stalled forks, restores replication fork stability and reduces the formation of replication stress-induced DNA breaks and chromosomal aberrations in BRCA1/2-deficient cells. In addition to SMARCAL1, other SNF2-family fork remodelers, including ZRANB3 and HLTF, cause nascent DNA degradation and genomic instability in BRCA1/2-deficient cells upon replication stress. Our observations indicate that nascent DNA degradation in BRCA1/2-deficient cells occurs as a consequence of MRE11-dependent nucleolytic processing of reversed forks generated by fork remodelers. These studies provide mechanistic insights into the processes that cause genome instability in BRCA1/2-deficient cells.",

        "Abstract": "T-cell clonality of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is routinely evaluated with a PCR-based method using genomic DNA. However, there are limitations with this approach. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of RNA-seq for assessing T-cell clonality and T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) repertoire of the neoplastic T-cells in 108 PTCL samples. TCR transcripts, including complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences, were assessed. In normal T cells, the CDR3 sequences were extremely diverse, without any clonotype representing more than 2% of the overall TCR population. Dominant clones could be identified in 65 out of 76 PTCL cases (86%) with adequate TCR transcript expression. In monoclonal cases, the dominant clone varied between 11% and 99% of TCR\u03b2 transcripts. No unique V\u03b1 or V\u03b2 usage was observed. Small T-cell clones were often observed in T- and NK-cell tumors in a percentage higher than observed in reactive conditions. \u03b3 chain expression was very low in tumors expressing TCR\u03b1\u03b2, but its expression level was high and clonality was detected in a TCR\u03b3\u03b4 expressing tumor. NK cell lymphoma (NKCL) did not express significant levels of TCR V\u03b2 or V\u03b3 genes. RNA-seq is a useful tool for detecting and characterizing clonal TCR rearrangements in PTCL.",

        "Abstract": "Both conventional T (Tconv) cells and regulatory T\u00a0(Treg) cells are activated through ligation of the T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR) complex, leading to the induction of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. In Tconv cells, NF-\u03baB regulates expression of genes essential for T\u00a0cell activation, proliferation, and function. However the role of NF-\u03baB in Treg function remains unclear. We conditionally deleted canonical NF-\u03baB members p65 and c-Rel in developing and mature Treg cells and found they have unique but partially redundant roles. c-Rel was critical for thymic Treg development while p65 was essential for mature Treg identity and maintenance of immune tolerance. Transcriptome and NF-\u03baB p65 binding analyses demonstrated a lineage specific, NF-\u03baB-dependent transcriptional program, enabled by enhanced chromatin accessibility. These dual roles of canonical NF-\u03baB in Tconv and Treg cells highlight the functional plasticity of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and underscores the need for more selective strategies to therapeutically target NF-\u03baB.",

The identification of activating BCR mutations and the growth disadvantage upon BCR knockdown of cells of certain lymphoma entities has led to the view that BCR signalling is required for tumour cell survival. Consequently, the BCR signalling machinery has become an established target in the therapy of B-cell malignancies. Here we study the effects of BCR ablation on MYC-driven mouse B-cell lymphomas and compare them with observations in human Burkitt lymphoma.

        "Abstract": "Transcriptional programs control cellular lineage commitment and differentiation during development. Understanding of cell fate has been advanced by studying single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) but is limited by the assumptions of current analytic methods regarding the structure of data. We present single-cell topological data analysis (scTDA), an algorithm for topology-based computational analyses to study temporal, unbiased transcriptional regulation. Unlike other methods, scTDA is a nonlinear, model-independent, unsupervised statistical framework that can characterize transient cellular states. We applied scTDA to the analysis of murine embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation in vitro in response to inducers of motor neuron differentiation. scTDA resolved asynchrony and continuity in cellular identity over time and identified four transient states (pluripotent, precursor, progenitor, and fully differentiated cells) based on changes in stage-dependent combinations of transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). scTDA can be applied to study asynchronous cellular responses to either developmental cues or environmental perturbations.",

        "Abstract": "The distribution of sense and antisense strand DNA mutations on transcribed duplex DNA contributes to the development of immune and neural systems along with the progression of cancer. Because developmentally matured B cells undergo biologically programmed strand-specific DNA mutagenesis at focal DNA/RNA hybrid structures, they make a convenient system to investigate strand-specific mutagenesis mechanisms. We demonstrate that the sense and antisense strand DNA mutagenesis at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus and some other regions of the B cell genome depends upon localized RNA processing protein complex formation in the nucleus. Both the physical proximity and coupled activities of RNA helicase Mtr4 (and senataxin) with the noncoding RNA processing function of RNA exosome determine the strand-specific distribution of DNA mutations. Our study suggests that strand-specific DNA mutagenesis-associated mechanisms will play major roles in other undiscovered aspects of organismic development.",

        "Abstract": "Cytosolic sensing of nucleic acids initiates tightly regulated programs to limit infection. Oocyte fertilization represents a scenario wherein inappropriate responses to exogenous yet non-pathogen-derived nucleic acids would have negative consequences. We hypothesized that germ cells express negative regulators of nucleic acid sensing (NAS) in steady state and applied an integrated data-mining and functional genomics approach to identify a rheostat of DNA and RNA sensing-the inflammasome component NLRP14. We demonstrated that NLRP14 interacted physically with the nucleic acid sensing pathway and targeted TBK1 (TANK binding kinase\u00a01) for ubiquitination and degradation. We further mapped domains in NLRP14 and TBK1 that mediated the inhibitory function. Finally, we identified a human nonsense germline variant associated with male sterility that results in loss of NLRP14 function and hyper-responsiveness to nucleic acids. The discovery points to a mechanism of nucleic acid sensing regulation that may be of particular importance in fertilization.",

        "Abstract": "Precision medicine in cancer proposes that genomic characterization of tumors can inform personalized targeted therapies. However, this proposition is complicated by spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Here we study genomic and expression profiles across 127 multisector or longitudinal specimens from 52 individuals with glioblastoma (GBM). Using bulk and single-cell data, we find that samples from the same tumor mass share genomic and expression signatures, whereas geographically separated, multifocal tumors and/or long-term recurrent tumors are seeded from different clones. Chemical screening of patient-derived glioma cells (PDCs) shows that therapeutic response is associated with genetic similarity, and multifocal tumors that are enriched with PIK3CA mutations have a heterogeneous drug-response pattern. We show that targeting truncal events is more efficacious than targeting private events in reducing the tumor burden. In summary, this work demonstrates that evolutionary inference from integrated genomic analysis in multisector biopsies can inform targeted therapeutic interventions for patients with GBM.",

        "Abstract": "Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) accounts for the majority of S.\u00a0aureus infections globally, and yet surprisingly little is known about its clonal evolution. We applied comparative whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analyses to epidemiologically and geographically diverse ST398-MSSA, a pandemic lineage affecting both humans and livestock. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis predicted divergence of human-associated ST398-MSSA ~40\u00a0years ago. Isolates from Midwestern pigs and veterinarians differed substantially from those in New York City (NYC). Pig ST398 strains contained a large region of recombination representing imports from multiple sequence types (STs). Phylogeographic analyses supported the spread of ST398-MSSA along local cultural and migratory links between parts of the Caribbean, North America, and France, respectively. Applying pairwise single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distances as a measure of genetic relatedness between isolates, we observed that ST398 not only clustered in households but also frequently extended across local social networks. Isolates collected from environmental surfaces reflected the full diversity of colonizing individuals, highlighting their potentially critical role as reservoirs for transmission and diversification. Strikingly, we observed high within-host SNP variability compared to our previous studies on the dominant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clone USA300. Our data indicate that the dynamics of colonization, persistence, and transmission differ substantially between USA300-MRSA and ST398-MSSA. Taken together, our study reveals local and international routes of transmission for a major MSSA clone, indicating key impacts of recombination and mutation on genetic diversification and highlighting important ecological differences from epidemic USA300. Our study demonstrates extensive local and international routes of transmission for a major MSSA clone despite the lack of substantial antibiotic resistance.",

        "Abstract": "Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas frequently associated with poor prognosis and for which genetic mechanisms of transformation remain incompletely understood. Using RNA sequencing and targeted sequencing, here we identify a recurrent in-frame deletion (VAV1 \u0394778-786) generated by a focal deletion-driven alternative splicing mechanism as well as novel VAV1 gene fusions (VAV1-THAP4, VAV1-MYO1F, and VAV1-S100A7) in PTCL. Mechanistically these genetic lesions result in increased activation of VAV1 catalytic-dependent (MAPK, JNK) and non-catalytic-dependent (nuclear factor of activated T cells, NFAT) VAV1 effector pathways. These results support a driver oncogenic role for VAV1 signaling in the pathogenesis of PTCL.",

        "Abstract": "Amidst the growing literature on cancer genomics and intratumor heterogeneity, essential principles in evolutionary biology recur time and time again. Here we use these principles to guide the reader through major advances in cancer research, highlighting issues of \"hit hard, hit early\" treatment strategies, drug resistance, and metastasis. We distinguish between two frameworks for understanding heterogeneous tumors, both of which can inform treatment strategies: (1) The tumor as diverse ecosystem, a Darwinian population of sometimes-competing, sometimes-cooperating cells; (2) The tumor as tightly integrated, self-regulating organ, which may hijack developmental signals to restore functional heterogeneity after treatment. While the first framework dominates literature on cancer evolution, the second framework enjoys support as well. Throughout this review, we illustrate how mathematical models inform understanding of tumor progression and treatment outcomes. Connecting models to genomic data faces computational and technical hurdles, but high-throughput single-cell technologies show promise to clear these hurdles. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Evolutionary principles - heterogeneity in cancer?, edited by Dr. Robert A. Gatenby.",

        "Abstract": "A well-defined risk factor and precursor for cutaneous melanoma is the dysplastic nevus. These benign tumors represent clonal hyperproliferation of melanocytes that are in a senescent-like state, but with occasional malignant transformation events. To portray the mutational repertoire of dysplastic nevi in patients with the dysplastic nevus syndrome and to determine the discriminatory profiles of melanocytic nevi (including dysplastic nevi) from melanoma, we sequenced exomes of melanocytic nevi including dysplastic nevi (n\u00a0= 19), followed by a targeted gene panel (785 genes) characterization of melanocytic nevi (n\u00a0= 46) and primary melanomas (n\u00a0= 42). Exome sequencing revealed that dysplastic nevi harbored a substantially lower mutational load than melanomas (21 protein-changing mutations versus >100). Known \"driver\" mutations in genes for melanoma, including CDKN2A, TP53, NF1, RAC1, and PTEN, were not found among any melanocytic nevi sequenced. Additionally, melanocytic nevi including dysplastic nevi showed a significantly lower frequency and a different UV-associated mutational signature. These results show that although melanocytic nevi and dysplastic nevi harbor stable genomes with relatively few alterations, progression into melanomas requires additional mutational processes affecting key tumor suppressors. This study identifies molecular parameters that could be useful for diagnostic platforms.",

        "Abstract": "Although multiagent combination chemotherapy is curative in a significant fraction of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, 20% of cases relapse and most die because of chemorefractory disease. Here we used whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing to analyze the mutational landscape at relapse in pediatric ALL cases. These analyses identified numerous relapse-associated mutated genes intertwined in chemotherapy resistance-related protein complexes. In this context, RAS-MAPK pathway-activating mutations in the neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), and protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) genes were present in 24 of 55 (44%) cases in our series. Interestingly, some leukemias showed retention or emergence of RAS mutant clones at relapse, whereas in others RAS mutant clones present at diagnosis were replaced by RAS wild-type populations, supporting a role for both positive and negative selection evolutionary pressures in clonal evolution of RAS-mutant leukemia. Consistently, functional dissection of mouse and human wild-type and mutant RAS isogenic leukemia cells demonstrated induction of methotrexate resistance but also improved the response to vincristine in mutant RAS-expressing lymphoblasts. These results highlight the central role of chemotherapy-driven selection as a central mechanism of leukemia clonal evolution in relapsed ALL, and demonstrate a previously unrecognized dual role of RAS mutations as drivers of both sensitivity and resistance to chemotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "The recent explosion of genomic data has underscored the need for interpretable and comprehensive analyses that can capture complex phylogenetic relationships within and across species. Recombination, reassortment and horizontal gene transfer constitute examples of pervasive biological phenomena that cannot be captured by tree-like representations. Starting from hundreds of genomes, we are interested in the reconstruction of potential evolutionary histories leading to the observed data. Ancestral recombination graphs represent potential histories that explicitly accommodate recombination and mutation events across orthologous genomes. However, they are computationally costly to reconstruct, usually being infeasible for more than few tens of genomes. Recently, Topological Data Analysis (TDA) methods have been proposed as robust and scalable methods that can capture the genetic scale and frequency of recombination. We build upon previous TDA developments for detecting and quantifying recombination, and present a novel framework that can be applied to hundreds of genomes and can be interpreted in terms of minimal histories of mutation and recombination events, quantifying the scales and identifying the genomic locations of recombinations. We implement this framework in a software package, called TARGet, and apply it to several examples, including small migration between different populations, human recombination, and horizontal evolution in finches inhabiting the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.",

        "Abstract": "Meiotic recombination is a fundamental evolutionary process driving diversity in eukaryotes. In mammals, recombination is known to occur preferentially at specific genomic regions. Using topological data analysis (TDA), a branch of applied topology that extracts global features from large data sets, we developed an efficient method for mapping recombination at fine scales. When compared to standard linkage-based methods, TDA can deal with a larger number of SNPs and genomes without incurring prohibitive computational costs. We applied TDA to 1,000 Genomes Project data and constructed high-resolution whole-genome recombination maps of seven human populations. Our analysis shows that recombination is generally under-represented within transcription start sites. However, the binding sites of specific transcription factors are enriched for sites of recombination. These include transcription factors that regulate the expression of meiosis- and gametogenesis-specific genes, cell cycle progression, and differentiation blockage. Additionally, our analysis identifies an enrichment for sites of recombination at repeat-derived loci matched by piwi-interacting RNAs.",

        "Abstract": "Nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL) is a rare, indolent B-cell tumor that is distinguished from splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) by the different pattern of dissemination. NMZL still lacks distinct markers and remains orphan of specific cancer gene lesions. By combining whole-exome sequencing, targeted sequencing of tumor-related genes, whole-transcriptome sequencing, and high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis, we aimed at disclosing the pathways that are molecularly deregulated in NMZL and we compare the molecular profile of NMZL with that of SMZL. These analyses identified a distinctive pattern of nonsilent somatic lesions in NMZL. In 35 NMZL patients, 41 genes were found recurrently affected in \u22653 (9%) cases, including highly prevalent molecular lesions of MLL2 (also known as KMT2D; 34%), PTPRD (20%), NOTCH2 (20%), and KLF2 (17%). Mutations of PTPRD, a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase regulating cell growth, were enriched in NMZL across mature B-cell tumors, functionally caused the loss of the phosphatase activity of PTPRD, and were associated with cell-cycle transcriptional program deregulation and increased proliferation index in NMZL. Although NMZL shared with SMZL a common mutation profile, NMZL harbored PTPRD lesions that were otherwise absent in SMZL. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the genetics of NMZL, identify PTPRD lesions as a novel marker for this lymphoma across mature B-cell tumors, and support the distinction of NMZL as an independent clinicopathologic entity within the current lymphoma classification.",

        "Abstract": "Missense mutations in ATM kinase, a master regulator of DNA damage responses, are found in many cancers, but their impact on ATM function and implications for cancer therapy are largely unknown. Here we report that 72% of cancer-associated ATM mutations are missense mutations that are enriched around the kinase domain. Expression of kinase-dead ATM (Atm(KD/-)) is more oncogenic than loss of ATM (Atm(-/-)) in mouse models, leading to earlier and more frequent lymphomas with Pten deletions. Kinase-dead ATM protein (Atm-KD), but not loss of ATM (Atm-null), prevents replication-dependent removal of Topo-isomerase I-DNA adducts at the step of strand cleavage, leading to severe genomic instability and hypersensitivity to Topo-isomerase I inhibitors. Correspondingly, Topo-isomerase I inhibitors effectively and preferentially eliminate Atm(KD/-), but not Atm-proficientor Atm(-/-) leukemia in animal models. These findings identify ATM kinase-domain missense mutations as a potent oncogenic event and a biomarker for Topo-isomerase I inhibitor based therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. To better understand how GBM evolves, we analyzed longitudinal genomic and transcriptomic data from 114 patients. The analysis shows a highly branched evolutionary pattern in which 63% of patients experience expression-based subtype changes. The branching pattern, together with estimates of evolutionary rate, suggests that relapse-associated clones typically existed years before diagnosis. Fifteen percent of tumors present hypermutation at relapse in highly expressed genes, with a clear mutational signature. We find that 11% of recurrence tumors harbor mutations in LTBP4, which encodes a protein binding to TGF-\u03b2. Silencing LTBP4 in GBM cells leads to suppression of TGF-\u03b2 activity and decreased cell proliferation. In recurrent GBM with wild-type IDH1, high LTBP4 expression is associated with worse prognosis, highlighting the TGF-\u03b2 pathway as a potential therapeutic target in GBM.",

Comparative genomic hybridization (Array-CGH) and whole-exome sequencing analyses of both samples suggest that this leukemia may have originated from a common T/myeloid progenitor. The presence of homozygous deletion of p16/INK4A, p14/ARF, p15/INK4B, and heterozygous deletion of WT1 locus remained stable in the leukemia throughout phenotypic switch, revealing that this AML can be genetically associated to T-ALL.",

        "Abstract": "Protein synthesis in eukaryotes is regulated by diverse reprogramming mechanisms that expand the coding capacity of individual genes. Here, we exploit one such mechanism, termed -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF), to engineer ligand-responsive RNA switches that regulate protein expression. First, efficient -1 PRF stimulatory RNA elements were discovered by in vitro selection; then, ligand-responsive switches were constructed by coupling -1 PRF stimulatory elements to RNA aptamers using rational design and directed evolution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that -1 PRF switches tightly control the relative stoichiometry of two distinct protein outputs from a single mRNA, exhibiting consistent ligand response across whole populations of cells. Furthermore, -1 PRF switches were applied to build single-mRNA logic gates and an apoptosis module in yeast. Together, these results showcase the potential for harnessing translation-reprogramming mechanisms for synthetic biology, and they establish -1 PRF switches as powerful RNA tools for controlling protein synthesis in eukaryotes.",

        "Title": "Prognostic and therapeutic role of targetable lesions in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia without recurrent fusion genes.",
        "Abstract": "To shed light into the molecular bases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia lacking known fusion transcripts, i.e. BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, E2A-PBX1, and MLL rearrangements (B-NEG ALL) and the differences between children, adolescents/young adults (AYA) and adults, we analyzed 168 B-NEG ALLs by genome-wide technologies. This approach showed that B-NEG cases carry 10.5 mutations and 9.1 copy-number aberrations/sample. The most frequently mutated druggable pathways were those pertaining to RAS/RTK (26.8%) and JAK/STAT (12.5%) signaling. In particular, FLT3 and JAK/STAT mutations were detected mainly in AYA and adults, while KRAS and NRAS mutations were more frequent in children. RAS/RTK mutations negatively affected the outcome of AYA and adults, but not that of children. Furthermore, adult B-NEG ALL carrying JAK/STAT mutations had a shorter survival. In vitro experiments showed that FLT3 inhibitors reduced significantly the proliferation of FLT3-mutated primary B-NEG ALL cells. Likewise, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors reduced the proliferation of primary cells harboring RAS and IL7R mutations. These results refine the genetic landscape of B-NEG ALL and suggest that the different distribution of lesions and their prognostic impact might sustain the diverse outcome between children, adults and partly AYA - whose genomic scenario is similar to adults - and open the way to targeted therapeutic strategies.",

We defined the complete set of genes associated with 1,122 diffuse grade II-III-IV gliomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas and used molecular profiles to improve disease classification, identify molecular correlations, and provide insights into the progression from low- to high-grade disease. Whole-genome sequencing data analysis determined that ATRX but not TERT promoter mutations are associated with increased telomere length. Recent advances in glioma classification based on IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion status were recapitulated through analysis of DNA methylation profiles, which identified clinically relevant molecular subsets. A subtype of IDH mutant glioma was associated with DNA demethylation and poor outcome; a group of IDH-wild-type diffuse glioma showed molecular similarity to pilocytic astrocytoma and relatively favorable survival. Understanding of cohesive disease groups may aid improved clinical outcomes.",

With Ebola virus, Marburg virus is a member of the family Filoviridae that causes severe hemorrhagic fever disease in humans and nonhuman primates, but results in little to no pathological consequences in bats. Understanding host-pathogen interactions within reservoir host species and how it differs from hosts that experience severe disease is an important aspect of evaluating viral pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutics and methods of prevention.",

        "Abstract": "Whole exome sequencing and copy number aberration (CNA) analysis were performed on cells taken from peripheral blood (PB) and lymph nodes (LN) of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Of 64 non-silent somatic mutations, 54 (84\u00b74%) were clonal in both compartments, 3 (4\u00b77%) were PB-specific and 7 (10\u00b79%) were LN-specific. Most of the LN- or PB-specific mutations were subclonal in the other corresponding compartment (variant frequency 0\u00b75-5\u00b73%). Of 41 CNAs, 27 (65\u00b78%) were shared by both compartments and 7 (17\u00b71%) were LN- or PB-specific. Overall, 6 of 9 cases (66\u00b77%) showed genomic differences between the compartments. At subsequent relapse, Case 10, with 6 LN-specific lesions, and Case 100, with 6 LN-specific and 8 PB-specific lesions, showed, in the PB, the clonal expansion of LN-derived lesions with an adverse impact: SF3B1 mutation, BIRC3 deletion, del8(p23\u00b73-p11\u00b71), del9(p24\u00b73-p13\u00b71) and gain 2(p25\u00b73-p14). CLL shows an intra-patient clonal heterogeneity according to the disease compartment, with both LN and PB-specific mutations/CNAs. The LN microenvironment might contribute to the clonal selection of unfavourable lesions, as LN-derived mutations/CNAs can appear in the PB at relapse.",

Here we performed whole-exome sequencing of tumor-normal sample pairs from 25 patients with S\u00e9zary syndrome and 17 patients with other CTCLs. These analyses identified a distinctive pattern of somatic copy number alterations in S\u00e9zary syndrome, including highly prevalent chromosomal deletions involving the TP53, RB1, PTEN, DNMT3A and CDKN1B tumor suppressors. Mutation analysis identified a broad spectrum of somatic mutations in key genes involved in epigenetic regulation (TET2, CREBBP, KMT2D (MLL2), KMT2C (MLL3), BRD9, SMARCA4 and CHD3) and signaling, including MAPK1, BRAF, CARD11 and PRKG1 mutations driving increased MAPK, NF-\u03baB and NFAT activity upon T cell receptor stimulation. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the genetics of S\u00e9zary syndrome and CTCL and support the development of personalized therapies targeting key oncogenically activated signaling pathways for the treatment of these diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Regulatory B cells (Breg) have immune suppressive functions in various autoimmune/inflammation models and diseases and are found to be enriched in diverse B cell subsets. The lack of a unique marker or set of markers efficiently identifying Breg cells impedes detailed investigation into their origin, development, and immunological roles. Here, we perform transcriptome analysis of IL-10-expressing B cells to identify key regulators for Breg biogenesis and function and identify CD9, a tetraspanin-family transmembrane protein, as a key surface marker for most mouse IL-10(+) B cells and their progenitors. CD9 plays a role in the suppressive function of IL-10(+) B cells in ex vivo T cell proliferation assays through a mechanism that is dependent upon B/T cell interactions. CD9(+) B cells also demonstrate inhibition of Th1-mediated contact hypersensitivity in an in vivo model system. Taken together, our findings implicate CD9 in the immunosuppressive activity of regulatory B cells.",

        "Abstract": "Endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL) is primarily found in children in equatorial regions and represents the first historical example of a virus-associated human malignancy. Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and MYC translocations are hallmarks of the disease, it is unclear whether other factors may contribute to its development. We performed RNA-Seq on 20 eBL cases from Uganda and showed that the mutational and viral landscape of eBL is more complex than previously reported. First, we found the presence of other herpesviridae family members in 8 cases (40%), in particular human herpesvirus 5 and human herpesvirus 8 and confirmed their presence by immunohistochemistry in the adjacent non-neoplastic tissue. Second, we identified a distinct latency program in EBV involving lytic genes in association with TCF3 activity. Third, by comparing the eBL mutational landscape with published data on sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (sBL), we detected lower frequencies of mutations in MYC, ID3, TCF3 and TP53, and a higher frequency of mutation in ARID1A in eBL samples. Recurrent mutations in two genes not previously associated with eBL were identified in 20% of tumors: RHOA and cyclin F (CCNF). We also observed that polyviral samples showed lower numbers of somatic mutations in common altered genes in comparison to sBL specimens, suggesting dual mechanisms of transformation, mutation versus virus driven in sBL and eBL respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a clinical and biological heterogeneous disease that includes systemic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive and ALK-negative entities. To discover biomarkers and/or genes involved in ALK-negative ALCL pathogenesis, we applied the cancer outlier profile analysis algorithm to a gene expression profiling data set including 249 cases of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and normal T cells. Ectopic coexpression of ERBB4 and COL29A1 genes was detected in 24% of ALK-negative ALCL patients. RNA sequencing and 5' RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends identified 2 novel ERBB4-truncated transcripts displaying intronic transcription start sites. By luciferase assays, we defined that the expression of ERBB4-aberrant transcripts is promoted by endogenous intronic long terminal repeats. ERBB4 expression was confirmed at the protein level by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Lastly, we demonstrated that ERBB4-truncated forms show oncogenic potentials and that ERBB4 pharmacologic inhibition partially controls ALCL cell growth and disease progression in an ERBB4-positive patient-derived tumorgraft model. In conclusion, we identified a new subclass of ALK-negative ALCL characterized by aberrant expression of ERBB4-truncated transcripts carrying intronic 5' untranslated regions.",

        "Abstract": "Seasonal influenza epidemics and occasional pandemics threaten public health worldwide. New alternative strategies for generating recombinant viruses with vaccine potential are needed. Interestingly, influenza viruses circulating in different hosts have been found to have distinct codon usage patterns, which may reflect host adaptation. We therefore hypothesized that it is possible to make a human seasonal influenza virus that is specifically attenuated in human cells but not in eggs by converting its codon usage so that it is similar to that observed from avian influenza viruses. This approach might help to generate human live attenuated viruses without affecting their yield in eggs. To test this hypothesis, over 300 silent mutations were introduced into the genome of a seasonal H1N1 influenza virus. The resultant mutant was significantly attenuated in mammalian cells and mice, yet it grew well in embryonated eggs. A single dose of intranasal vaccination induced potent innate, humoral, and cellular immune responses, and the mutant could protect mice against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. The attenuated mutant could also be used as a vaccine master donor strain by introducing hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes derived from other strains. Thus, our approach is a successful strategy to generate attenuated viruses for future application as vaccines.",

        "Title": "Disease-associated mutation in SRSF2 misregulates splicing by altering RNA-binding affinities.",
        "Abstract": "Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) is an RNA-binding protein that plays important roles in splicing of mRNA precursors. SRSF2 mutations are frequently found in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and certain leukemias, but how these mutations affect SRSF2 function has only begun to be examined. We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease to introduce the P95H mutation to SRSF2 in K562 leukemia cells, generating an isogenic model so that splicing alterations can be attributed solely to mutant SRSF2. We found that SRSF2 (P95H) misregulates 548 splicing events (<1% of total). Of these events, 374 involved the inclusion of cassette exons, and the inclusion was either increased (206) or decreased (168). We detected a specific motif (UCCA/UG) enriched in the more-included exons and a distinct motif (UGGA/UG) in the more-excluded exons. RNA gel shift assays showed that a mutant SRSF2 derivative bound more tightly than its wild-type counterpart to RNA sites containing UCCAG but bound less tightly to UGGAG sites. Thus in most cases the pattern of exon inclusion or exclusion correlated with stronger or weaker RNA binding, respectively. We further show that the P95H mutation does not affect other functions of SRSF2, i.e., protein-protein interactions with key splicing factors. Our results thus demonstrate that the P95H mutation positively or negatively alters the binding affinity of SRSF2 for cognate RNA sites in target transcripts, leading to misregulation of exon inclusion. Our findings shed light on the mechanism of the disease-associated SRSF2 mutation in splicing regulation and also reveal a group of misspliced mRNA isoforms for potential therapeutic targeting.",

        "Abstract": "We have ablated the cellular RNA degradation machinery in differentiated B cells and pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by conditional mutagenesis of core (Exosc3) and nuclear RNase (Exosc10) components of RNA exosome and identified a vast number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) with emergent functionality. Unexpectedly, eRNA-expressing regions accumulate R-loop structures upon RNA exosome ablation, thus demonstrating the role of RNA exosome in resolving deleterious DNA/RNA hybrids arising from active enhancers. We have uncovered a distal divergent eRNA-expressing element (lncRNA-CSR) engaged in long-range DNA interactions and regulating IgH 3' regulatory region super-enhancer function. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated ablation of lncRNA-CSR transcription decreases its chromosomal looping-mediated association with the IgH 3' regulatory region super-enhancer and leads to decreased class switch recombination efficiency. We propose that the RNA exosome protects divergently transcribed lncRNA expressing enhancers by resolving deleterious transcription-coupled secondary DNA structures, while also regulating long-range super-enhancer chromosomal interactions important for cellular function.",

        "Abstract": "Tumors are the result of accumulated genomic alterations that cooperate synergistically to produce uncontrollable cell growth. Although identifying recurrent alterations among large collections of tumors provides a way to pinpoint genes that endow a selective advantage in oncogenesis and progression, it fails to address the genetic interactions behind this selection process. A non-random pattern of co-mutated genes is evidence for selective forces acting on tumor cells that harbor combinations of these genetic alterations. Although existing methods have successfully identified mutually exclusive gene sets, no current method can systematically discover more general genetic relationships. We develop Genomic Alteration Modules using Total Correlation (GAMToC), an information theoretic framework that integrates copy number and mutation data to identify gene modules with any non-random pattern of joint alteration. Additionally, we present the Seed-GAMToC procedure, which uncovers the mutational context of any putative cancer gene. The software is publicly available. Applied to glioblastoma multiforme samples, GAMToC results show distinct subsets of co-occurring mutations, suggesting distinct mutational routes to cancer and providing new insight into mutations associated with proneural, proneural/G-CIMP, and classical types of the disease. The results recapitulate known relationships such as mutual exclusive mutations, place these alterations in the context of other mutations, and find more complex relationships such as conditional mutual exclusivity.",

        "Abstract": "Despite large-scale cancer genomics studies, key somatic mutations driving cancer, and their functional roles, remain elusive. Here, we propose that analysis of comorbidities of Mendelian diseases with cancers provides a novel, systematic way to discover new cancer genes. If germline genetic variation in Mendelian loci predisposes bearers to common cancers, the same loci may harbour cancer-associated somatic variation. Compilations of clinical records spanning over 100 million patients provide an unprecedented opportunity to assess clinical associations between Mendelian diseases and cancers. We systematically compare these comorbidities against recurrent somatic mutations from more than 5,000 patients across many cancers. Using multiple measures of genetic similarity, we show that a Mendelian disease and comorbid cancer indeed have genetic alterations of significant functional similarity. This result provides a basis to identify candidate drivers in cancers including melanoma and glioblastoma. Some Mendelian diseases demonstrate 'pan-cancer' comorbidity and shared genetics across cancers.",

By integrating massive sequencing strategies, we provide a comprehensive characterization of driver genetic alterations (somatic point mutations, copy number alterations, and gene fusions) in ALK(-) ALCLs. We identified activating mutations of JAK1 and/or STAT3 genes in \u223c20% of 88 [corrected] ALK(-) ALCLs and demonstrated that 38% of systemic ALK(-) ALCLs displayed double lesions. Recurrent chimeras combining a transcription factor (NFkB2 or NCOR2) with a tyrosine kinase (ROS1 or TYK2) were also discovered in WT JAK1/STAT3 ALK(-) ALCL. All these aberrations lead to the constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway, which was proved oncogenic. Consistently, JAK/STAT3 pathway inhibition impaired cell growth in vitro and in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Viral outbreaks, such as the 2014 ebolavirus, can spread rapidly and have complex evolutionary dynamics, including coinfection and bulk transmission of multiple viral populations. Genomic surveillance can be hindered when the spread of the outbreak exceeds the evolutionary rate, in which case consensus approaches will have limited resolution. Deep sequencing of infected patients can identify genomic variants present in intrahost populations at subclonal frequencies (i.e. <50%). Shared subclonal variants (SSVs) can provide additional phylogenetic resolution and inform about disease transmission patterns.",

        "Abstract": "Elucidating the determinants of aggressiveness in lethal prostate cancer may stimulate therapeutic strategies that improve clinical outcomes. We used experimental models and clinical databases to identify GATA2 as a regulator of chemotherapy resistance and tumorigenicity in this context. Mechanistically, direct upregulation of the growth hormone IGF2 emerged as a mediator of the aggressive properties regulated by\u00a0GATA2. IGF2 in turn activated IGF1R and INSR as well as a downstream polykinase program. The characterization of this axis prompted a combination strategy whereby dual IGF1R/INSR inhibition restored the efficacy of chemotherapy and improved survival in preclinical models. These studies reveal a GATA2-IGF2 aggressiveness axis in lethal prostate cancer and identify a therapeutic opportunity in this challenging disease.",

        "Abstract": "Cancer is a clonal evolutionary process, caused by successive accumulation of genetic alterations providing milestones of tumor initiation, progression, dissemination, and/or resistance to certain therapeutic regimes. To unravel these milestones we propose a framework, tumor evolutionary directed graphs (TEDG), which is able to characterize the history of genetic alterations by integrating longitudinal and cross-sectional genomic data. We applied TEDG to a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cohort of 70 patients spanning 12 years and show that: (a) the evolution of CLL follows a time-ordered process represented as a global flow in TEDG that proceeds from initiating events to late events; (b) there are two distinct and mutually exclusive evolutionary paths of CLL evolution; (c) higher fitness clones are present in later stages of the disease, indicating a progressive clonal replacement with more aggressive clones. Our results suggest that TEDG may constitute an effective framework to recapitulate the evolutionary history of tumors.",

RNA sequencing offers a genome-wide view of expressed transcripts, uncovering biologically functional gene fusions.

        "Title": "Noncoding RNA transcription targets AID to divergently transcribed loci in B cells.",
        "Abstract": "The vast majority of the mammalian genome has the potential to express noncoding RNA (ncRNA). The 11-subunit RNA exosome complex is the main source of cellular 3'-5' exoribonucleolytic activity and potentially regulates the mammalian noncoding transcriptome. Here we generated a mouse model in which the essential subunit Exosc3 of the RNA exosome complex can be conditionally deleted. Exosc3-deficient B cells lack the ability to undergo normal levels of class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation, two mutagenic DNA processes used to generate antibody diversity via the B-cell mutator protein activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). The transcriptome of Exosc3-deficient B cells has revealed the presence of many novel RNA exosome substrate ncRNAs. RNA exosome substrate RNAs include xTSS-RNAs, transcription start site (TSS)-associated antisense transcripts that can exceed 500 base pairs in length and are transcribed divergently from cognate coding gene transcripts. xTSS-RNAs are most strongly expressed at genes that accumulate AID-mediated somatic mutations and/or are frequent translocation partners of DNA double-strand breaks generated at Igh in B cells. Strikingly, translocations near TSSs or within gene bodies occur over regions of RNA exosome substrate ncRNA expression. These RNA exosome-regulated, antisense-transcribed regions of the B-cell genome recruit AID and accumulate single-strand DNA structures containing RNA-DNA hybrids. We propose that RNA exosome regulation of ncRNA recruits AID to single-strand DNA-forming sites of antisense and divergent transcription in the B-cell genome, thereby creating a link between ncRNA transcription and overall maintenance of B-cell genomic integrity.",

        "Abstract": "The mammary gland is a very dynamic organ that undergoes continuous remodeling. The critical regulators of this process are not fully understood. Here we identify the microRNA cluster miR-424(322)/503 as an important regulator of epithelial involution after pregnancy. Through the generation of a knockout mouse model, we found that regression of the secretory acini of the mammary gland was compromised in the absence of miR-424(322)/503. Mechanistically, we show that miR-424(322)/503 orchestrates cell life and death decisions by targeting BCL-2 and IGF1R (insulin growth factor-1 receptor). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expression of this microRNA cluster is regulated by TGF-\u03b2, a well-characterized regulator of mammary involution. Overall, our data suggest a model in which activation of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway after weaning induces the transcription of miR-424(322)/503, which in turn down-regulates the expression of key genes. Here, we unveil a previously unknown, multilayered regulation of epithelial tissue remodeling coordinated by the microRNA cluster miR-424(322)/503.",

        "Abstract": "Many problems in biomedical research can be posed as a comparison between related samples (healthy vs. disease, subtypes of the same disease, longitudinal data representing the progression of a disease, etc). In the cases in which the distinction has a genetic or epigenetic basis, next-generation sequencing technologies have become a major tool for obtaining the difference between the samples. A commonly occurring application is the identification of somatic mutations occurring in tumor tissue samples driving a single cell to expand clonally. In this case, the progression of the disease can be traced through the trajectory of the frequency of the oncogenic alleles. Thus obtaining precise estimates of the frequency of abnormal alleles at various stages of the disease is paramount to understanding the processes driving it. Although the procedure is conceptually simple, technical difficulties arise due to inhomogeneous samples, existence of competing subclonal populations, and systematic and non-systematic errors introduced by the sequencing technologies.",

        "Abstract": "Fludarabine refractoriness (FR) represents an unsolved clinical problem of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) management. Although next-generation sequencing studies have led to the identification of a number of genes frequently mutated in FR-CLL, a comprehensive evaluation of the FR-CLL genome has not been reported. Toward this end, we studied 10 FR-CLLs by combining whole-exome sequencing and copy number aberration (CNA) analysis, which showed an average of 16.3 somatic mutations and 4 CNAs per sample. Screening of recurrently mutated genes in 48 additional FR-CLLs revealed that ~70% of FR-CLLs carry \u22651 mutation in genes previously associated with CLL clinical course, including TP53 (27.5%), NOTCH1 (24.1%), SF3B1 (18.9%), and BIRC3 (15.5%). In addition, this analysis showed that 10.3% of FR-CLL cases display mutations of the FAT1 gene, which encodes for a cadherin-like protein that negatively regulates Wnt signaling, consistent with a tumor suppressor role. The frequency of FAT1-mutated cases was significantly higher in FR-CLL than in unselected CLLs at diagnosis (10.3% vs 1.1%, P = .004), suggesting a role in the development of a high-risk phenotype. These findings have general implications for the mechanisms leading to FR and point to Wnt signaling as a potential therapeutic target in FR-CLL.",

        "Abstract": "TP53 mutations are strong predictors of poor survival and refractoriness in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and have direct implications for disease management. Clinical information on TP53 mutations is limited to lesions represented in >20% leukemic cells. Here, we tested the clinical impact and prediction of chemorefractoriness of very small TP53 mutated subclones. The TP53 gene underwent ultra-deep-next generation sequencing (NGS) in 309 newly diagnosed CLL. A robust bioinformatic algorithm was established for the highly sensitive detection of few TP53 mutated cells (down to 3 out of \u223c1000 wild-type cells). Minor subclones were validated by independent approaches. Ultra-deep-NGS identified small TP53 mutated subclones in 28/309 (9%) untreated CLL that, due to their very low abundance (median allele frequency: 2.1%), were missed by Sanger sequencing. Patients harboring small TP53 mutated subclones showed the same clinical phenotype and poor survival (hazard ratio = 2.01; P = .0250) as those of patients carrying clonal TP53 lesions. By longitudinal analysis, small TP53 mutated subclones identified before treatment became the predominant population at the time of CLL relapse and anticipated the development of chemorefractoriness. This study provides a proof-of-principle that very minor leukemia subclones detected at diagnosis are an important driver of the subsequent disease course.",

        "Title": "Leukaemogenesis induced by an activating \u03b2-catenin mutation in osteoblasts.",
        "Abstract": "Cells of the osteoblast lineage affect the homing and the number of long-term repopulating haematopoietic stem cells, haematopoietic stem cell mobilization and lineage determination and B cell lymphopoiesis. Osteoblasts were recently implicated in pre-leukaemic conditions in mice. However, a single genetic change in osteoblasts that can induce leukaemogenesis has not been shown. Here we show that an activating mutation of \u03b2-catenin in mouse osteoblasts alters the differentiation potential of myeloid and lymphoid progenitors leading to development of acute myeloid leukaemia with common chromosomal aberrations and cell autonomous progression. Activated \u03b2-catenin stimulates expression of the Notch ligand jagged 1 in osteoblasts. Subsequent activation of Notch signalling in haematopoietic stem cell progenitors induces the malignant changes. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Notch signalling ameliorates acute myeloid leukaemia and demonstrates the pathogenic role of the Notch pathway. In 38% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukaemia, increased \u03b2-catenin signalling and nuclear accumulation was identified in osteoblasts and these patients showed increased Notch signalling in haematopoietic cells. These findings demonstrate that genetic alterations in osteoblasts can induce acute myeloid leukaemia, identify molecular signals leading to this transformation and suggest a potential novel pharmacotherapeutic approach to acute myeloid leukaemia.",

        "Abstract": "Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a heterogeneous and poorly understood group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Here we combined whole-exome sequencing of 12 tumor-normal DNA pairs, RNA sequencing analysis and targeted deep sequencing to identify new genetic alterations in PTCL transformation. These analyses identified highly recurrent epigenetic factor mutations in TET2, DNMT3A and IDH2 as well as a new highly prevalent RHOA mutation encoding a p.Gly17Val alteration present in 22 of 35 (67%) angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) samples and in 8 of 44 (18%) PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) samples. Mechanistically, the RHOA Gly17Val protein interferes with RHOA signaling in biochemical and cellular assays, an effect potentially mediated by the sequestration of activated guanine-exchange factor (GEF) proteins. In addition, we describe new and recurrent, albeit less frequent, genetic defects including mutations in FYN, ATM, B2M and CD58 implicating SRC signaling, impaired DNA damage response and escape from immune surveillance mechanisms in the pathogenesis of PTCL.",

The pathogenesis of this process remains largely unknown. Using whole-exome sequencing and copy-number analysis, we show here that the dominant clone of FL and transformed FL (tFL) arise by divergent evolution from a common mutated precursor through the acquisition of distinct genetic events. Mutations in epigenetic modifiers and antiapoptotic genes are introduced early in the common precursor, whereas tFL is specifically associated with alterations deregulating cell-cycle progression and DNA damage responses (CDKN2A/B, MYC, and TP53) as\u00a0well as aberrant somatic hypermutation. The genomic profile of tFL shares similarities with that of germinal center B cell-type de novo DLBCL but also displays unique combinations of altered genes with diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

        "Abstract": "The tree structure is currently the accepted paradigm to represent evolutionary relationships between organisms, species or other taxa. However, horizontal, or reticulate, genomic exchanges are pervasive in nature and confound characterization of phylogenetic trees. Drawing from algebraic topology, we present a unique evolutionary framework that comprehensively captures both clonal and reticulate evolution. We show that whereas clonal evolution can be summarized as a tree, reticulate evolution exhibits nontrivial topology of dimension greater than zero. Our method effectively characterizes clonal evolution, reassortment, and recombination in RNA viruses. Beyond detecting reticulate evolution, we succinctly recapitulate the history of complex genetic exchanges involving more than two parental strains, such as the triple reassortment of H7N9 avian influenza and the formation of circulating HIV-1 recombinants. In addition, we identify recurrent, large-scale patterns of reticulate evolution, including frequent PB2-PB1-PA-NP cosegregation during avian influenza reassortment. Finally, we bound the rate of reticulate events (i.e., 20 reassortments per year in avian influenza). Our method provides an evolutionary perspective that not only captures reticulate events precluding phylogeny, but also indicates the evolutionary scales where phylogenetic inference could be accurate.",

        "Abstract": "Richter syndrome (RS) derives from the rare transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) into an aggressive lymphoma, most commonly of the diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) type. The molecular pathogenesis of RS is only partially understood. By combining whole-exome sequencing and copy-number analysis of 9 CLL-RS pairs and of an extended panel of 43 RS cases, we show that this aggressive disease typically arises from the predominant CLL clone by acquiring an average of \u223c20 genetic lesions/case. RS lesions are heterogeneous in terms of load and spectrum among patients, and include those involved in CLL progression and chemorefractoriness (TP53 disruption and NOTCH1 activation) as well as some not previously implicated in CLL or RS pathogenesis. In particular, disruption of the CDKN2A/B cell cycle regulator is associated with \u223c30% of RS cases. Finally, we report that the genomic landscape of RS is significantly different from that of de novo DLBCL, suggesting that they represent distinct disease entities. These results provide insights into RS pathogenesis, and identify dysregulated pathways of potential diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.",

By mining the medical records of over 110 million patients, we examine the extent to which Mendelian variation contributes to complex disease risk. We detect thousands of associations between Mendelian and complex diseases, revealing a nondegenerate, phenotypic code that links each complex disorder to a unique collection of Mendelian loci. Using genome-wide association results, we demonstrate that common variants associated with complex diseases are enriched in the genes indicated by this \"Mendelian code.\" Finally, we detect hundreds of comorbidity associations among Mendelian disorders, and we use probabilistic genetic modeling to demonstrate that Mendelian variants likely contribute nonadditively to the risk for a subset of complex diseases. Overall, this study illustrates a complementary approach for mapping complex disease loci and provides unique predictions concerning the etiologies of specific diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Programmed mutagenesis of the immunoglobulin locus of B lymphocytes during class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation requires RNA polymerase II (polII) transcription complex-dependent targeting of the DNA mutator activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). AID deaminates cytidine residues on substrate sequences in the immunoglobulin (Ig) locus via a transcription-dependent mechanism, and this activity is stimulated by the RNA polII stalling cofactor Spt5 and the 11-subunit cellular noncoding RNA 3'-5' exonucleolytic processing complex RNA exosome. The mechanism by which the RNA exosome recognizes immunoglobulin locus RNA substrates to stimulate AID DNA deamination activity on its in vivo substrate sequences is an important question. Here we report that E3-ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 destabilizes AID-associated RNA polII by a ubiquitination event, leading to generation of 3' end free RNA exosome RNA substrates at the Ig locus and other AID target sequences genome-wide. We found that lack of Nedd4 activity in B cells leads to accumulation of RNA exosome substrates at AID target genes and defective CSR. Taken together, our study links noncoding RNA processing following RNA polII pausing with regulation of the mutator AID protein. Our study also identifies Nedd4 as a regulator of noncoding RNAs that are generated by stalled RNA polII genome-wide.",

        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma is one of the most challenging forms of cancer to treat. Here we describe a computational platform that integrates the analysis of copy number variations and somatic mutations and unravels the landscape of in-frame gene fusions in glioblastoma. We found mutations with loss of heterozygosity in LZTR1, encoding an adaptor of CUL3-containing E3 ligase complexes. Mutations and deletions disrupt LZTR1 function, which restrains the self renewal and growth of glioma spheres that retain stem cell features. Loss-of-function mutations in CTNND2 target a neural-specific gene and are associated with the transformation of glioma cells along the very aggressive mesenchymal phenotype. We also report recurrent translocations that fuse the coding sequence of EGFR to several partners, with EGFR-SEPT14 being the most frequent functional gene fusion in human glioblastoma. EGFR-SEPT14 fusions activate STAT3 signaling and confer mitogen independence and sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. These results provide insights into the pathogenesis of glioblastoma and highlight new targets for therapeutic intervention.",

        "Abstract": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive hematological tumor resulting from the malignant transformation of lymphoid progenitors. Despite intensive chemotherapy, 20% of pediatric patients and over 50% of adult patients with ALL do not achieve a complete remission or relapse after intensified chemotherapy, making disease relapse and resistance to therapy the most substantial challenge in the treatment of this disease. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identify mutations in the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene (NT5C2), which encodes a 5'-nucleotidase enzyme that is responsible for the inactivation of nucleoside-analog chemotherapy drugs, in 20/103 (19%) relapse T cell ALLs and 1/35 (3%) relapse B-precursor ALLs. NT5C2 mutant proteins show increased nucleotidase activity in vitro and conferred resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine when expressed in ALL lymphoblasts. These results support a prominent role for activating mutations in NT5C2 and increased nucleoside-analog metabolism in disease progression and chemotherapy resistance in ALL.",

        "Abstract": "With the advent of deep sequencing, genomic surveillance has become a popular method for detection of infectious disease, supplementing information gathered by classic clinical or serological techniques to identify host-determinant markers and trace the origin of transmission. However, two main factors complicate genomic surveillance. First, pathogens exhibiting high genetic diversity demand higher levels of scrutiny to obtain an accurate representation of the entire population. Second, current systems of detection are nonuniform, with significant gaps in certain geographic locations and animal reservoirs. Despite past unforeseen pandemics like the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus, there is no standardized way of evaluating surveillance. A more complete surveillance system should capture a greater proportion of pathogen diversity. Here we present a novel quantitative method of assessing the completeness of genomic surveillance that incorporates the time of sequence collection, as well as the pathogen's evolutionary rate. We propose the q2 coefficient, which measures the proportion of sequenced isolates whose closest neighbor in the past is within a genetic distance equivalent to 2 years of evolution, roughly the median time of changing strain selection for influenza A vaccines. Easily interpretable and significantly faster than other methods, the q2 coefficient requires no full phylogenetic characterization or use of arbitrary clade definitions. Application of the q2 coefficient to influenza A virus confirmed poor sampling of swine and avian populations and identified regions with deficient surveillance. We demonstrate that the q2 coefficient can not only be applied to other pathogens, including dengue and West Nile viruses, but also used to describe surveillance dynamics, particularly the effects of different public health policies.",

        "Abstract": "The identification of new genetic lesions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) prompts a comprehensive and dynamic prognostic algorithm including gene mutations and chromosomal abnormalities and their changes during clonal evolution. By integrating mutational and cytogenetic analysis in 1274 CLL samples and using both a training-validation and a time-dependent design, 4 CLL subgroups were hierarchically classified: (1) high-risk, harboring TP53 and/or BIRC3 abnormalities (10-year survival: 29%); (2) intermediate-risk, harboring NOTCH1 and/or SF3B1 mutations and/or del11q22-q23 (10-year survival: 37%); (3) low-risk, harboring +12 or a normal genetics (10-year survival: 57%); and (4) very low-risk, harboring del13q14 only, whose 10-year survival (69.3%) did not significantly differ from a matched general population. This integrated mutational and cytogenetic model independently predicted survival, improved CLL prognostication accuracy compared with FISH karyotype (P < .0001), and was externally validated in an independent CLL cohort. Clonal evolution from lower to higher risk implicated the emergence of NOTCH1, SF3B1, and BIRC3 abnormalities in addition to TP53 and 11q22-q23 lesions. By taking into account clonal evolution through time-dependent analysis, the genetic model maintained its prognostic relevance at any time from diagnosis. These findings may have relevant implications for the design of clinical trials aimed at assessing the use of mutational profiling to inform therapeutic decisions.",

        "Abstract": "Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is a B cell malignancy of unknown pathogenesis, and thus an orphan of targeted therapies. By integrating whole-exome sequencing and copy-number analysis, we show that the SMZL exome carries at least 30 nonsilent gene alterations. Mutations in NOTCH2, a gene required for marginal-zone (MZ) B cell development, represent the most frequent lesion in SMZL, accounting for \u223c20% of cases. All NOTCH2 mutations are predicted to cause impaired degradation of the NOTCH2 protein by eliminating the C-terminal PEST domain, which is required for proteasomal recruitment. Among indolent B cell lymphoproliferative disorders, NOTCH2 mutations are restricted to SMZL, thus representing a potential diagnostic marker for this lymphoma type. In addition to NOTCH2, other modulators or members of the NOTCH pathway are recurrently targeted by genetic lesions in SMZL; these include NOTCH1, SPEN, and DTX1. We also noted mutations in other signaling pathways normally involved in MZ B cell development, suggesting that deregulation of MZ B cell development pathways plays a role in the pathogenesis of \u223c60% SMZL. These findings have direct implications for the treatment of SMZL patients, given the availability of drugs that can target NOTCH, NF-\u03baB, and other pathways deregulated in this disease.",

        "Abstract": "The brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is among the most lethal forms of human cancer. Here, we report that a small subset of GBMs (3.1%; 3 of 97 tumors examined) harbors oncogenic chromosomal translocations that fuse in-frame the tyrosine kinase coding domains of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes (FGFR1 or FGFR3) to the transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC) coding domains of TACC1 or TACC3, respectively. The FGFR-TACC fusion protein displays oncogenic activity when introduced into astrocytes or stereotactically transduced in the mouse brain. The fusion protein, which localizes to mitotic spindle poles, has constitutive kinase activity and induces mitotic and chromosomal segregation defects and triggers aneuploidy. Inhibition of FGFR kinase corrects the aneuploidy, and oral administration of an FGFR inhibitor prolongs survival of mice harboring intracranial FGFR3-TACC3-initiated glioma. FGFR-TACC fusions could potentially identify a subset of GBM patients who would benefit from targeted FGFR kinase inhibition.",

        "Abstract": "Many chemotherapeutic regimens produce neutropenia, which predisposes to microbial infection. However, not all neutropenic individuals develop infections, so the ability to predict this outcome would be a powerful clinical tool. In this issue of the JCI, Malka et al. describe a dynamic system model of neutrophil bactericidal activity that confirms and extends the concept of critical neutrophil concentration. The authors demonstrate that when the neutrophil concentration approaches the critical concentration, bacterial populations in contact with them exhibit bistability. Their experimental findings raise the intriguing possibility of greater variability in bactericidal activity of neutrophils from healthy adults than heretofore recognized; their model predicts that this could have life-and-death consequences.",

        "Abstract": "Increased translocation of intestinal bacteria is a hallmark of chronic liver disease and contributes to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Here we tested the hypothesis that the intestinal microbiota and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) promote hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a long-term consequence of chronic liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Hepatocarcinogenesis in chronically injured livers depended on the intestinal microbiota and TLR4 activation in non-bone-marrow-derived resident liver cells. TLR4 and the intestinal microbiota were not required for HCC initiation but for HCC promotion, mediating increased proliferation, expression of the hepatomitogen epiregulin, and prevention of apoptosis. Gut sterilization restricted to late stages of hepatocarcinogenesis reduced HCC, suggesting that the intestinal microbiota and TLR4 represent therapeutic targets for HCC prevention in advanced liver disease.",

        "Abstract": "Recent developments in extracting and processing biological and clinical data are allowing quantitative approaches to studying living systems. High-throughput sequencing (HTS), expression profiles, proteomics, and electronic health records (EHR) are some examples of such technologies. Extracting meaningful information from those technologies requires careful analysis of the large volumes of data they produce. In this note, we present a set of fractal-like distributions that commonly appear in the analysis of such data. The first set of examples are drawn from a HTS experiment. Here, the distributions appear as part of the evaluation of the error rate of the sequencing and the identification of tumorogenic genomic alterations. The other examples are obtained from risk factor evaluation and analysis of relative disease prevalence and co-mordbidity as these appear in EHR. The distributions are also relevant to identification of subclonal populations in tumors and the study of quasi-species and intrahost diversity of viral populations.",

        "Title": "Viral reassortment as an information exchange between viral segments.",
        "Abstract": "Viruses have an extraordinary ability to diversify and evolve. For segmented viruses, reassortment can introduce drastic genomic and phenotypic changes by allowing a direct exchange of genetic material between coinfecting strains. For instance, multiple influenza pandemics were caused by reassortments of viruses typically found in separate hosts. What is unclear, however, are the underlying mechanisms driving these events and the level of intrinsic bias in the diversity of strains that emerge from coinfection. To address this problem, previous experiments looked for correlations between segments of strains that coinfect cells in vitro. Here, we present an information theory approach as the natural mathematical framework for this question. We study, for influenza and other segmented viruses, the extent to which a virus's segments can communicate strain information across an infection and among one another. Our approach goes beyond previous association studies and quantifies how much the diversity of emerging strains is altered by patterns in reassortment, whether biases are consistent across multiple strains and cell types, and if significant information is shared among more than two segments. We apply our approach to a new experiment that examines reassortment patterns between the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and seasonal H1N1 strains, contextualizing its segmental information sharing by comparison with previously reported strain reassortments. We find evolutionary patterns across classes of experiments and previously unobserved higher-level structures. Finally, we show how this approach can be combined with virulence potentials to assess pandemic threats.",

        "Abstract": "T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an immature hematopoietic malignancy driven mainly by oncogenic activation of NOTCH1 signaling. In this study we report the presence of loss-of-function mutations and deletions of the EZH2 and SUZ12 genes, which encode crucial components of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), in 25% of T-ALLs. To further study the role of PRC2 in T-ALL, we used NOTCH1-dependent mouse models of the disease, as well as human T-ALL samples, and combined locus-specific and global analysis of NOTCH1-driven epigenetic changes. These studies demonstrated that activation of NOTCH1 specifically induces loss of the repressive mark Lys27 trimethylation of histone 3 (H3K27me3) by antagonizing the activity of PRC2. These studies suggest a tumor suppressor role for PRC2 in human leukemia and suggest a hitherto unrecognized dynamic interplay between oncogenic NOTCH1 and PRC2 function for the regulation of gene expression and cell transformation.",

        "Abstract": "Identifying emerging viral pathogens and characterizing their transmission is essential to developing effective public health measures in response to an epidemic. Phylogenetics, though currently the most popular tool used to characterize the likely host of a virus, can be ambiguous when studying species very distant to known species and when there is very little reliable sequence information available in the early stages of the outbreak of disease. Motivated by an existing framework for representing biological sequence information, we learn sparse, tree-structured models, built from decision rules based on subsequences, to predict viral hosts from protein sequence data using popular discriminative machine learning tools. Furthermore, the predictive motifs robustly selected by the learning algorithm are found to show strong host-specificity and occur in highly conserved regions of the viral proteome.",

        "Abstract": "Analysis of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) coding genome has recently disclosed that the NOTCH1 proto-oncogene is recurrently mutated at CLL presentation. Here, we assessed the prognostic role of NOTCH1 mutations in CLL. Two series of newly diagnosed CLL were used as training (n = 309) and validation (n = 230) cohorts. NOTCH1 mutations occurred in 11.0% and 11.3% CLL of the training and validation series, respectively. In the training series, NOTCH1 mutations led to a 3.77-fold increase in the hazard of death and to shorter overall survival (OS; P < .001). Multivariate analysis selected NOTCH1 mutations as an independent predictor of OS after controlling for confounding clinical and biologic variables. The independent prognostic value of NOTCH1 mutations was externally confirmed in the validation series. The poor prognosis conferred by NOTCH1 mutations was attributable, at least in part, to shorter treatment-free survival and higher risk of Richter transformation. Although NOTCH1 mutated patients were devoid of TP53 disruption in more than 90% cases in both training and validation series, the OS predicted by NOTCH1 mutations was similar to that of TP53 mutated/deleted CLL. NOTCH1 mutations are an independent predictor of CLL OS, tend to be mutually exclusive with TP53 abnormalities, and identify cases with a dismal prognosis.",

        "Abstract": "The genetic lesions identified in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) do not entirely recapitulate the disease pathogenesis and the development of serious complications, such as chemorefractoriness. While investigating the coding genome of fludarabine-refractory CLL, we observed that mutations of SF3B1, encoding a splicing factor and representing a critical component of the cell spliceosome, were recurrent in 10 of 59 (17%) fludarabine-refractory cases, with a frequency significantly greater than that observed in a consecutive CLL cohort sampled at diagnosis (17/301, 5%; P = .002). Mutations were somatically acquired, were generally represented by missense nucleotide changes, clustered in selected HEAT repeats of the SF3B1 protein, recurrently targeted 3 hotspots (codons 662, 666, and 700), and were predictive of a poor prognosis. In fludarabine-refractory CLL, SF3B1 mutations and TP53 disruption distributed in a mutually exclusive fashion (P = .046). The identification of SF3B1 mutations points to splicing regulation as a novel pathogenetic mechanism of potential clinical relevance in CLL.",

        "Abstract": "Among acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with a normal karyotype (CN-AML), NPM1 and CEBPA mutations define World Health Organization 2008 provisional entities accounting for approximately 60% of patients, but the remaining 40% are molecularly poorly characterized. Using whole-exome sequencing of one CN-AML patient lacking mutations in NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3-ITD, IDH1, and MLL-PTD, we newly identified a clonal somatic mutation in BCOR (BCL6 corepressor), a gene located on chromosome Xp11.4. Further analyses of 553 AML patients showed that BCOR mutations occurred in 3.8% of unselected CN-AML patients and represented a substantial fraction (17.1%) of CN-AML patients showing the same genotype as the AML index patient subjected to whole-exome sequencing. BCOR somatic mutations were: (1) disruptive events similar to the germline BCOR mutations causing the oculo-facio-cardio-dental genetic syndrome; (2) associated with decreased BCOR mRNA levels, absence of full-length BCOR, and absent or low expression of a truncated BCOR protein; (3) virtually mutually exclusive with NPM1 mutations; and (4) frequently associated with DNMT3A mutations, suggesting cooperativity among these genetic alterations. Finally, BCOR mutations tended to be associated with an inferior outcome in a cohort of 422 CN-AML patients (25.6% vs 56.7% overall survival at 2 years; P = .032). Our results for the first time implicate BCOR in CN-AML pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of human lymphoma. Although a number of structural alterations have been associated with the pathogenesis of this malignancy, the full spectrum of genetic lesions that are present in the DLBCL genome, and therefore the identity of dysregulated cellular pathways, remains unknown. By combining next-generation sequencing and copy number analysis, we show that the DLBCL coding genome contains, on average, more than 30 clonally represented gene alterations per case. This analysis also revealed mutations in genes not previously implicated in DLBCL pathogenesis, including those regulating chromatin methylation (MLL2; 24% of samples) and immune recognition by T cells. These results provide initial data on the complexity of the DLBCL coding genome and identify novel dysregulated pathways underlying its pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic health record (EHR) systems offer an exceptional opportunity for studying many diseases and their associated medical conditions within a population. The increasing number of clinical record entries that have become available electronically provides access to rich, large sets of patients' longitudinal medical information. By integrating and comparing relations found in the EHRs with those already reported in the literature, we are able to verify existing and to identify rare or novel associations. Of particular interest is the identification of rare disease co-morbidities, where the small numbers of diagnosed patients make robust statistical analysis difficult. Here, we introduce ADAMS, an Application for Discovering Disease Associations using Multiple Sources, which contains various statistical and language processing operations. We apply ADAMS to the New York-Presbyterian Hospital's EHR to combine the information from the relational diagnosis tables and textual discharge summaries with those from PubMed and Wikipedia in order to investigate the co-morbidities of the rare diseases Kaposi sarcoma, toxoplasmosis, and Kawasaki disease. In addition to finding well-known characteristics of diseases, ADAMS can identify rare or previously unreported associations. In particular, we report a statistically significant association between Kawasaki disease and diagnosis of autistic disorder.",

        "Abstract": "The pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in adults, is still largely unknown. The full spectrum of genetic lesions that are present in the CLL genome, and therefore the number and identity of dysregulated cellular pathways, have not been identified. By combining next-generation sequencing and copy number analysis, we show here that the typical CLL coding genome contains <20 clonally represented gene alterations/case, including predominantly nonsilent mutations, and fewer copy number aberrations. These analyses led to the discovery of several genes not previously known to be altered in CLL. Although most of these genes were affected at low frequency in an expanded CLL screening cohort, mutational activation of NOTCH1, observed in 8.3% of CLL at diagnosis, was detected at significantly higher frequency during disease progression toward Richter transformation (31.0%), as well as in chemorefractory CLL (20.8%). Consistent with the association of NOTCH1 mutations with clinically aggressive forms of the disease, NOTCH1 activation at CLL diagnosis emerged as an independent predictor of poor survival. These results provide initial data on the complexity of the CLL coding genome and identify a dysregulated pathway of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.",

        "Abstract": "B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma comprises biologically and clinically distinct diseases the pathogenesis of which is associated with genetic lesions affecting oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes. We report here that the two most common types--follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma--harbour frequent structural alterations inactivating CREBBP and, more rarely, EP300, two highly related histone and non-histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that act as transcriptional co-activators in multiple signalling pathways. Overall, about 39% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 41% of follicular lymphoma cases display genomic deletions and/or somatic mutations that remove or inactivate the HAT coding domain of these two genes. These lesions usually affect one allele, suggesting that reduction in HAT dosage is important for lymphomagenesis. We demonstrate specific defects in acetylation-mediated inactivation of the BCL6 oncoprotein and activation of the p53 tumour suppressor. These results identify CREBBP/EP300 mutations as a major pathogenetic mechanism shared by common forms of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with direct implications for the use of drugs targeting acetylation/deacetylation mechanisms.",

        "Title": "Oligonucleotide motifs that disappear during the evolution of influenza virus in humans increase alpha interferon secretion by plasmacytoid dendritic cells.",
        "Abstract": "CpG motifs in an A/U context have been preferentially eliminated from classical H1N1 influenza virus genomes during virus evolution in humans. The hypothesis of the current work is that CpG motifs in a uracil context represent sequence patterns with the capacity to induce an immune response, and the avoidance of this immunostimulatory signal is the reason for the observed preferential decline. To analyze the immunogenicity of these domains, we used plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). pDCs express pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), which recognizes guanosine- and uridine-rich viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), including influenza virus ssRNA. The signaling through TLR7 results in the induction of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon (IFN-I), an essential process for the induction of specific adaptive immune responses and for mounting a robust antiviral response mediated by IFN-\u03b1. Secretion of IFN-\u03b1 is also linked to the activation of other immune cells, potentially amplifying the effect of an initial IFN-\u03b1 secretion. We therefore also examined the role of IFN-\u03b1-driven activation of NK cells as another source of selective pressure on the viral genome. We found direct evidence that CpG RNA motifs in a U-rich context control pDC activation and IFN-\u03b1-driven activation of NK cells, likely through TLR7. These data provide a potential explanation for the loss of CpG motifs from avian influenza viruses as they adapt to mammalian hosts. The selective decrease of CpG motifs surrounded by U/A may be a viral strategy to avoid immune recognition, a strategy likely shared by highly expressed human immune genes.",

A full genome sequencing was carried out on 26 of these, and a partial sequencing on the remaining eight. We observed no evidence that the high CFR can be attributed to direct virus changes. No evidence of re-assortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs, or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence was observed. Although the mutation D225G associated with severity in the latest reports from the Ukraine and Norway is not observed among the Argentine strains, an amino acid change in the area (S206T) surrounding the HA receptor binding domain was observed, the same previously established worldwide.",

        "Abstract": "Although vaccines pose the best means of preventing influenza infection, strain selection and optimal implementation remain difficult due to antigenic drift and a lack of understanding global spread. Detecting viral movement by sequence analysis is complicated by skewed geographic and seasonal distributions in viral isolates. We propose a probabilistic method that accounts for sampling bias through spatiotemporal clustering and modeling regional and seasonal transmission as a binomial process. Analysis of H3N2 not only confirmed East-Southeast Asia as a source of new seasonal variants, but also increased the resolution of observed transmission to a country level. H1N1 data revealed similar viral spread from the tropics. Network analysis suggested China and Hong Kong as the origins of new seasonal H3N2 strains and the United States as a region where increased vaccination would maximally disrupt global spread of the virus. These techniques provide a promising methodology for the analysis of any seasonal virus, as well as for the continued surveillance of influenza.",

        "Title": "Frequency analysis techniques for identification of viral genetic data.",
        "Abstract": "Environmental metagenomic samples and samples obtained as an attempt to identify a pathogen associated with the emergence of a novel infectious disease are important sources of novel microorganisms. The low costs and high throughput of sequencing technologies are expected to allow for the genetic material in those samples to be sequenced and the genomes of the novel microorganisms to be identified by alignment to those in a database of known genomes. Yet, for various biological and technical reasons, such alignment might not always be possible. We investigate a frequency analysis technique which on one hand allows for the identification of genetic material without relying on alignment and on the other hand makes possible the discovery of nonoverlapping contigs from the same organism. The technique is based on obtaining signatures of the genetic data and defining a distance/similarity measure between signatures. More precisely, the signatures of the genetic data are the frequencies of k-mers occurring in them, with k being a natural number. We considered an entropy-based distance between signatures, similar to the Kullback-Leibler distance in information theory, and investigated its ability to categorize negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viral genetic data. Our conclusion is that in this viral context, the technique provides a viable way of discovering genetic relationships without relying on alignment. We envision that our approach will be applicable to other microbial genetic contexts, e.g., other types of viruses, and will be an important tool in the discovery of novel microorganisms.",

A better understanding of viral evolution and host adaptive responses might help control this disease.",

        "Abstract": "Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) mariculture has been associated with epidemics of infectious diseases that threaten not only local production, but also wild fish coming into close proximity to marine pens and fish escaping from them. Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) is a frequently fatal disease of farmed Atlantic salmon. First recognized in one farm in Norway in 1999, HSMI was subsequently implicated in outbreaks in other farms in Norway and the United Kingdom. Although pathology and disease transmission studies indicated an infectious basis, efforts to identify an agent were unsuccessful. Here we provide evidence that HSMI is associated with infection with piscine reovirus (PRV). PRV is a novel reovirus identified by unbiased high throughput DNA sequencing and a bioinformatics program focused on nucleotide frequency as well as sequence alignment and motif analyses. Formal implication of PRV in HSMI will require isolation in cell culture and fulfillment of Koch's postulates, or prevention or modification of disease through use of specific drugs or vaccines. Nonetheless, as our data indicate that a causal relationship is plausible, measures must be taken to control PRV not only because it threatens domestic salmon production but also due to the potential for transmission to wild salmon populations.",

        "Abstract": "Tumor suppressor genes on the X chromosome may skew the gender distribution of specific types of cancer. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy with an increased incidence in males. In this study, we report the identification of inactivating mutations and deletions in the X-linked plant homeodomain finger 6 (PHF6) gene in 16% of pediatric and 38% of adult primary T-ALL samples. Notably, PHF6 mutations are almost exclusively found in T-ALL samples from male subjects. Mutational loss of PHF6 is importantly associated with leukemias driven by aberrant expression of the homeobox transcription factor oncogenes TLX1 and TLX3. Overall, these results identify PHF6 as a new X-linked tumor suppressor in T-ALL and point to a strong genetic interaction between PHF6 loss and aberrant expression of TLX transcription factors in the pathogenesis of this disease.",

One theory suggests imperfect surveillance of swine viruses caused the virus to be missed in swine herds. Other hypotheses point to the possibility of laboratory error or an avian intermediary. We show substitution bias classification identifies the host where a virus has been evolving. Comparing the evolution of H1N1pdm ancestors with other influenza viruses, we show the evolutionary history in unsampled years is similar to the evolution of other swine viruses, presenting evidence it emerged from unsampled herds.",

        "Abstract": "The absence of a full-length PB1-F2 protein has been suggested as one possible determinant for the low pathogenicity of the 2009 Influenza A H1N1 pandemic strain. Since the PB1-F2 sequence of this strain has three stop codons and its ancestors encode a full-length protein, the stop codons must have appeared recently. This suggests that the PB1-F2 protein is not evolutionary and functionally important for the new virus. We investigate the role of this protein in the evolution of influenza A viruses, and in particular in relation to the history of the new strain. We show that its evolutionary history is comparable to other, non-translated, subsequences in the PB1 segment, suggesting that PB1-F2 does not contribute significantly to the fitness of the influenza A virus.",

        "Abstract": "In the early phase of the 2009 A (H1N1) pandemic a marked increase in severity and a shift in the age distribution toward younger persons was found, with higher severity reported in patients with pre-existing medical conditions and pregnant women. Consistent with previous pandemics, the age and clinical history of the patients play a critical role in the morbidity and mortality associated with the pandemic virus. This is the first influenza pandemic in the information era, where enormous amounts of information will be available from the pathogen and the patient. Recent advances in molecular techniques have provided an enormous amount of information about pathogens in near real time and at relatively low cost. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide another enormously rich set of information about patients, which include patient preconditions, previous exposures, immunization history, presenting complaints, duration and severity of illness, treatment history, and geographic location. An infectious disease is a complex interplay between host and pathogen. The morbidity and mortality of a virus depend on the virus, the patient, and the environment. To evaluate and understand the severity of the pandemic virus and to identify the populations at risk of mild or severe, life-threatening illness, it is compulsory to integrate viral and patient information in a fast and accurate way. Both advances in biomedical informatics with the creation of EHRs and molecular techniques provide the framework to achieve these aims.",

        "Abstract": "Human populations contain a functional coding polymorphism (codon 72) in the p53 gene. To explore whether this polymorphism alters the transcriptional pattern of p53-regulated genes, the human isogenic cell lines harboring p53 with either the proline or arginine at codon 72 were employed to activate p53-mediated transcription. Thirty-four p53-regulated genes were assayed for their increased levels of mRNA using quantitative real-time PCR. The largest difference between p53-arginine and p53-proline was found with the PERP gene involved in cell-cell adhesion and apoptosis. The most common set of genes that are transcribed better by the p53-arginine protein than the p53-proline protein was found in the apoptotic function (DR-4, NOXA, PUMA, and PIG-3). LIF, a cytokine that is required for optimal reproductive function, was produced at 2x higher levels by the p53-arginine than the p53-proline allele. The genes that induced their mRNAs at the highest levels compared to the baseline tended to be synthesized better by the p53-arginine protein than the p53-proline protein. These molecular studies may help to explain the complicated associations observed between this polymorphism and the incidence of some cancers, the longevity of some populations, and the fecundity of different groups.",

        "Abstract": "Three human influenza pandemics occurred in the twentieth century, in 1918, 1957, and 1968. Influenza pandemic strains are the results of emerging viruses from non-human reservoirs to which humans have little or no immunity. At least two of these pandemic strains, in 1957 and in 1968, were the results of reassortments between human and avian viruses. Also, many cases of swine influenza viruses have reportedly infected humans, in particular, the recent H1N1 influenza virus of swine origin, isolated in Mexico and the United States. Pigs are documented to allow productive replication of human, avian, and swine influenza viruses. Thus it has been conjectured that pigs are the \"mixing vessel\" that create the avian-human reassortant strains, causing the human pandemics. Hence, studying the process and patterns of viral reassortment, especially in pigs, is a key to better understanding of human influenza pandemics. In the last few years, databases containing sequences of influenza A viruses, including swine viruses, collected since 1918 from diverse geographical locations, have been developed and made publicly available. In this paper, we study an ensemble of swine influenza viruses to analyze the reassortment phenomena through several statistical techniques. The reassortment patterns in swine viruses prove to be similar to the previous results found in human viruses, both in vitro and in vivo, that the surface glycoprotein coding segments reassort most often. Moreover, we find that one of the polymerase segments (PB1), reassorted in the strains responsible for the last two human pandemics, also reassorts frequently.",

        "Abstract": "Since the spring of 1977, two subtypes of influenza A virus (H3N2 and H1N1) have been seasonally infecting the human population. In this work we study the distribution of patient ages within the populations that exhibit the symptomatic disease caused by each of the different subtypes of seasonal influenza viruses. When the publicly available extensive information is pooled across multiple geographical locations and seasons, striking differences emerge between these subtypes. We report that the symptomatic flu due to H1N1 is distributed mainly in a younger population relative to H3N2. (The median age of the H3N2 patients is 23 years while H1N1 patients are 9 years old.) These distinct characteristic spectra of age groups, possibly carried over from previous pandemics, are consistent with previous reports from various regional population studies and also findings on the evolutionary dynamics of each subtype. Moreover, they are relevant to age-related risk assessments, modeling of epidemiological networks for specific age groups, and age-specific vaccine design.

        "Abstract": "The innate immune response provides a first line of defense against pathogens by targeting generic differential features that are present in foreign organisms but not in the host. These innate responses generate selection forces acting both in pathogens and hosts that further determine their co-evolution. Here we analyze the nucleic acid sequence fingerprints of these selection forces acting in parallel on both host innate immune genes and ssRNA viral genomes. We do this by identifying dinucleotide biases in the coding regions of innate immune response genes in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and then use this signal to identify other significant host innate immune genes. The persistence of these biases in the orthologous groups of genes in humans and chickens is also examined. We then compare the significant motifs in highly expressed genes of the innate immune system to those in ssRNA viruses and study the evolution of these motifs in the H1N1 influenza genome. We argue that the significant under-represented motif pattern of CpG in an AU context--which is found in both the ssRNA viruses and innate genes, and has decreased throughout the history of H1N1 influenza replication in humans--is immunostimulatory and has been selected against during the co-evolution of viruses and host innate immune genes. This shows how differences in host immune biology can drive the evolution of viruses that jump into species with different immune priorities than the original host.",

        "Abstract": "This manuscript describes a novel strategy to improve HIV DNA vaccine design. Employing a new information theory based bioinformatic algorithm, we identify a set of nucleotide motifs which are common in the coding region of HIV, but are under-represented in genes that are highly expressed in the human genome. We hypothesize that these motifs contribute to the poor protein expression of gag, pol, and env genes from the c-DNAs of HIV clinical isolates. Using this approach and beginning with a codon optimized consensus gag gene, we recode the nucleotide sequence so as to remove these motifs without modifying the amino acid sequence. Transfecting the recoded DNA sequence into a human kidney cell line results in doubling the gag protein expression level compared to the codon optimized version. We then turn both sequences into DNA vaccines and compare induced antibody response in a murine model. Our sequence, which has the motifs removed, induces a five-fold increase in gag antibody response compared to the codon optimized vaccine.",

There are many pairs of viral segments that are very close to each other in nucleotide sequence but relatively far apart in reported time of isolation, resulting in an abnormally low evolutionary rate. Also, some sequences show clear evidence of apparent homologous recombination, a process normally assumed to be extremely rare or nonexistent in this virus. These findings may point to surprising new biology but are perhaps more readily explained by stock contamination or other errors in the sequencing laboratories.",

        "Abstract": "We report results from the analysis of complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from 112 Japanese semi-supercentenarians (aged above 105 years) combined with previously published data from 96 patients in each of three non-disease phenotypes: centenarians (99-105 years of age), healthy non-obese males, obese young males and four disease phenotypes, diabetics with and without angiopathy, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients. We analyze the correlation between mitochondrial polymorphisms and the longevity phenotype using two different methods. We first use an exhaustive algorithm to identify all maximal patterns of polymorphisms shared by at least five individuals and define a significance score for enrichment of the patterns in each phenotype relative to healthy normals. Our study confirms the correlations observed in a previous study showing enrichment of a hierarchy of haplogroups in the D clade for longevity. For the extreme longevity phenotype we see a single statistically significant signal: a progressive enrichment of certain \"beneficial\" patterns in centenarians and semi-supercentenarians in the D4a haplogroup. We then use Principal Component Spectral Analysis of the SNP-SNP Covariance Matrix to compare the measured eigenvalues to a Null distribution of eigenvalues on Gaussian datasets to determine whether the correlations in the data (due to longevity) arises from some property of the mutations themselves or whether they are due to population structure. The conclusion is that the correlations are entirely due to population structure (phylogenetic tree). We find no signal for a functional mtDNA SNP correlated with longevity. The fact that the correlations are from the population structure suggests that hitch-hiking on autosomal events is a possible explanation for the observed correlations.",

        "Title": "Patterns of evolution and host gene mimicry in influenza and other RNA viruses.",
        "Abstract": "It is well known that the dinucleotide CpG is under-represented in the genomic DNA of many vertebrates. This is commonly thought to be due to the methylation of cytosine residues in this dinucleotide and the corresponding high rate of deamination of 5-methycytosine, which lowers the frequency of this dinucleotide in DNA. Surprisingly, many single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate in these vertebrate hosts also have a very low presence of CpG dinucleotides in their genomes. Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and the evolution of a virus is inexorably linked to the nature and fate of its host. One therefore expects that virus and host genomes should have common features. In this work, we compare evolutionary patterns in the genomes of ssRNA viruses and their hosts. In particular, we have analyzed dinucleotide patterns and found that the same patterns are pervasively over- or under-represented in many RNA viruses and their hosts suggesting that many RNA viruses evolve by mimicking some of the features of their host's genes (DNA) and likely also their corresponding mRNAs. When a virus crosses a species barrier into a different host, the pressure to replicate, survive and adapt, leaves a footprint in dinucleotide frequencies. For instance, since human genes seem to be under higher pressure to eliminate CpG dinucleotide motifs than avian genes, this pressure might be reflected in the genomes of human viruses (DNA and RNA viruses) when compared to those of the same viruses replicating in avian hosts. To test this idea we have analyzed the evolution of the influenza virus since 1918. We find that the influenza A virus, which originated from an avian reservoir and has been replicating in humans over many generations, evolves in a direction strongly selected to reduce the frequency of CpG dinucleotides in its genome. Consistent with this observation, we find that the influenza B virus, which has spent much more time in the human population, has adapted to its human host and exhibits an extremely low CpG dinucleotide content. We believe that these observations directly show that the evolution of RNA viral genomes can be shaped by pressures observed in the host genome. As a possible explanation, we suggest that the strong selection pressures acting on these RNA viruses are most likely related to the innate immune response and to nucleotide motifs in the host DNA and RNAs.",

        "Abstract": "Germline genetics, gender and hormonal-signaling pathways are all well described modifiers of cancer risk and progression. Although an improved understanding of how germline genetic variants interact with other cancer risk factors may allow better prevention and treatment of human cancer, measuring and quantifying these interactions is challenging. In other areas of research, Information Theory has been used to quantitatively describe similar multivariate interactions. We implemented a novel information-theoretic analysis to measure the joint effect of a high frequency germline genetic variant of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway (MDM2 SNP309 T/G) and gender on clinical cancer phenotypes. This analysis quantitatively describes synergistic interactions among gender, the MDM2 SNP309 locus, and the age of onset of tumorigenesis in p53 mutation carriers. These results offer a molecular and genetic basis for the observed sexual dimorphism of cancer risk in p53 mutation carriers and a model is proposed that suggests a novel cancer prevention strategy for p53 mutation carriers.",

        "Abstract": "The influenza A virus has two basic modes of evolution. Because of a high error rate in the process of replication by RNA polymerase, the viral genome drifts via accumulated mutations. The second mode of evolution is termed a shift, which results from the reassortment of the eight segments of this virus. When two different influenza viruses co-infect the same host cell, new virions can be released that contain segments from both parental strains. This type of shift has been the source of at least two of the influenza pandemics in the 20th century (H2N2 in 1957 and H3N2 in 1968).",

        "Title": "Highly conserved regions of influenza a virus polymerase gene segments are critical for efficient viral RNA packaging.",
        "Abstract": "The genome of the influenza A virus is composed of eight different segments of negative-sense RNA. These eight segments are incorporated into budding virions in an equimolar ratio through a mechanism that is not fully understood. Two different models have been proposed for packaging the viral ribonucleoproteins into newly assembling virus particles: the random-incorporation model and the selective-incorporation model. In the last few years, increasing evidence from many different laboratories that supports the selective-incorporation model has been accumulated. In particular, different groups have shown that some large viral RNA regions within the coding sequences at both the 5' and 3' ends of almost every segment are sufficient for packaging foreign RNA sequences. If the packaging regions are crucial for the viability of the virus, we would expect them to be conserved. Using large-scale analysis of influenza A virus sequences, we developed a method of identifying conserved RNA regions whose conservation cannot be explained by population structure or amino acid conservation. Interestingly, the conserved sequences are located within the regions identified as important for efficient packaging. By utilizing influenza virus reverse genetics, we have rescued mutant viruses containing synonymous mutations within these highly conserved regions. Packaging of viral RNAs in these viruses was analyzed by reverse transcription using a universal primer and quantitative PCR for individual segments. Employing this approach, we have identified regions in the polymerase gene segments that, if mutated, result in reductions of more than 90% in the packaging of that particular polymerase viral RNA. Reductions in the level of packaging of a polymerase viral RNA frequently resulted in reductions of other viral RNAs as well, and the results form a pattern of hierarchy of segment interactions. This work provides further evidence for a selective packaging mechanism for influenza A viruses, demonstrating that these highly conserved regions are important for efficient packaging.",

        "Title": "Evolution of the influenza a virus: some new advances.",
        "Abstract": "Influenza is an RNA virus that causes mild to severe respiratory symptoms in humans and other hosts. Every year approximately half a million people around the world die from seasonal Influenza. But this number is substantially larger in the case of pandemics, with the most dramatic instance being the 1918 \"Spanish flu\" that killed more than 50 million people worldwide. In the last few years, thousands of Influenza genomic sequences have become publicly available, including the 1918 pandemic strain and many isolates from non-human hosts. Using these data and developing adequate bioinformatic and statistical tools, some of the major questions surrounding Influenza evolution are becoming tractable. Are the mutations and reassortments random? What are the patterns behind the virus's evolution? What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a virus adapted to one host to infect a different host? Why is Influenza seasonal? In this review, we summarize some of the recent progress in understanding the evolution of the virus.",

        "Abstract": "In the last few years, the genomic sequence data for thousands of influenza A virus strains, including the 1918 pandemic strain, and hundreds of isolates of the avian influenza virus H5N1, which is causing an increasing number of human fatalities, have become publicly available. This large quantity of sequence data allows us to do comparative genomics with the human and avian versions of the virus. We find that the nucleotide compositions of influenza A viruses infecting the two hosts are sufficiently different that we can determine the host at almost 100% accuracy. This assignment works at the segment level, which allows us to construct the reassortment history of individual segments within each strain. We suggest that the different nucleotide compositions can be explained by a host-dependent mutation bias. To support this idea, we estimate the fixation rates for the different polymerase segments and the ratios of synonymous to nonsynonymous changes. Additionally, we provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that the H1N1 influenza virus entered the human population just prior to the 1918 outbreak, with an earliest bound of 1910.",

With such an experiment the region of parameter space implied by PVLAS could be probed in a matter of minutes.",
