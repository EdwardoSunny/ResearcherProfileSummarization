        "Abstract": "The identification of microRNA (miRNA) targets by Ago2 crosslinking-immunoprecipitation (CLIP) methods has provided major insights into the biology of this important class of non-coding RNAs. However, these methods are technically challenging and not easily applicable to an in\u00a0vivo setting. To overcome these limitations and facilitate the investigation of miRNA functions in\u00a0vivo, we have developed a method based on a genetically engineered mouse harboring a conditional Halo-Ago2 allele expressed from the endogenous Ago2 locus. By using a resin conjugated to the HaloTag ligand, Ago2-miRNA-mRNA complexes can be purified from cells and tissues expressing the endogenous Halo-Ago2 allele. We demonstrate the reproducibility and sensitivity of this method in mouse embryonic stem cells, developing embryos, adult tissues, and autochthonous mouse models of human brain and lung cancers. This method and the datasets we have generated will facilitate the characterization of miRNA-mRNA networks in\u00a0vivo under physiological and pathological conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Polycistronic microRNA (miRNA) clusters are a common feature of vertebrate genomes. The coordinated expression of miRNAs belonging to different seed families from a single transcriptional unit suggests functional cooperation, but this hypothesis has not been experimentally tested. Here we report the characterization of an allelic series of genetically engineered mice harboring selective targeted deletions of individual components of the miR-17 \u223c 92 cluster. Our results demonstrate the coexistence of functional cooperation and specialization among members of this cluster, identify a previously undescribed function for the miR-17 seed family in controlling axial patterning in vertebrates and show that loss of miR-19 selectively impairs Myc-driven tumorigenesis in two models of human cancer. By integrating phenotypic analysis and gene expression profiling, we provide a genome-wide view of how the components of a polycistronic miRNA cluster affect gene expression in vivo. The reagents and data sets reported here will accelerate exploration of the complex biological functions of this important miRNA cluster.",

        "Abstract": "Chromosomal rearrangements have a central role in the pathogenesis of human cancers and often result in the expression of therapeutically actionable gene fusions. A recently discovered example is a fusion between the genes echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4 (EML4) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), generated by an inversion on the short arm of chromosome 2: inv(2)(p21p23). The EML4-ALK oncogene is detected in a subset of human non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and is clinically relevant because it confers sensitivity to ALK inhibitors. Despite their importance, modelling such genetic events in mice has proven challenging and requires complex manipulation of the germ line. Here we describe an efficient method to induce specific chromosomal rearrangements in vivo using viral-mediated delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to somatic cells of adult animals. We apply it to generate a mouse model of Eml4-Alk-driven lung cancer. The resulting tumours invariably harbour the Eml4-Alk inversion, express the Eml4-Alk fusion gene, display histopathological and molecular features typical of ALK(+) human NSCLCs, and respond to treatment with ALK inhibitors. The general strategy described here substantially expands our ability to model human cancers in mice and potentially in other organisms.",

        "Abstract": "MicroRNAs belonging to the miR-34 family have been proposed as critical modulators of the p53 pathway and potential tumor suppressors in human cancers. To formally test these hypotheses, we have generated mice carrying targeted deletion of all three members of this microRNA family. We show that complete inactivation of miR-34 function is compatible with normal development in mice. Surprisingly, p53 function appears to be intact in miR-34-deficient cells and tissues. Although loss of miR-34 expression leads to a slight increase in cellular proliferation in vitro, it does not impair p53-induced cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Furthermore, in contrast to p53-deficient mice, miR-34-deficient animals do not display increased susceptibility to spontaneous, irradiation-induced, or c-Myc-initiated tumorigenesis. We also show that expression of members of the miR-34 family is particularly high in the testes, lungs, and brains of mice and that it is largely p53-independent in these tissues. These findings indicate that miR-34 plays a redundant function in the p53 pathway and suggest additional p53-independent functions for this family of miRNAs.",

The miR-17-92 family of miRNA clusters is composed of 3 related, highly conserved, polycistronic miRNA genes that collectively encode for a total of 15 miRNAs. We discuss recent studies demonstrating that these miRNAs are essential for vertebrate development and homeostasis. We also show how their mutation or deregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases, including cancer and congenital developmental defects. Finally, we discuss the current evidence suggesting how the different miRNAs encoded by these 3 clusters can functionally cooperate to fine-tune signaling and developmental pathways.",

In particular, we have shown that p73 drives the expression of miR-34a, but not miR-34b and c, in mouse cortical neurons. miR-34a in turn modulates the expression of synaptic targets including synaptotagmin-1 and syntaxin-1A. Here we show that this axis is retained in mouse ES cells committed to differentiate toward a neurological phenotype. Moreover, overexpression of miR-34a alters hippocampal spinal morphology, and results in electrophysiological changes consistent with a reduction in spinal function. Therefore, the TAp73/miR-34a axis has functional relevance in primary neurons. These data reinforce a role for miR-34a in neuronal development.",
