        "Abstract": "Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) includes the Activated B-cell-like (ABC) and Germinal Center B-cell-like (GCB) subtypes, which differ in cell-of-origin, genetics and clinical response. By screening the subtype-specific activity of 211 drugs approved or in active clinical development for other diseases, we identified inhibitors of nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPTi) as active in a subset of GCB-DLBCLs in vitro and in vivo. We validated three chemically distinct NAMPTi for their on-target activity based on biochemical and genetic rescue approaches, and found the ratio between NAMPT:PARP1 RNA levels was predictive of NAMPTi sensitivity across DLBCL subtypes. Notably, the NAMPT:PARP1 transcript ratio predicts higher anti-tumor activity in BCL2-translocated GCB-DLBCL. Accordingly, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of BCL2 was potently synergistic with NAMPT blockade. These data support the inhibition of NAMPT as a therapeutically relevant strategy for BCL2-translocated DLBCLs.",

        "Abstract": "In response to T-cell-dependent antigens, mature B cells in the secondary lymphoid organs are stimulated to form germinal centers (GCs), which are histological structures deputed to antibody affinity maturation, a process associated with immunoglobulin gene editing by somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). GC B cells are heterogeneous and transition across multiple stages before being eliminated by apoptosis or committing to post-GC differentiation as memory B cells or plasma cells. In order to explore the dynamics of SHM and CSR during the GC reaction, we identified GC subpopulations by single-cell (sc) transcriptomics and analyzed the load of immunoglobulin variable (V) region mutations as well as the isotype class distribution in each subpopulation. The results showed that the large majority of GC B cells display a quantitatively similar mutational load in the V regions and analogous IGH isotype class distribution, except for the precursors of memory B cells (PreM) and plasma cells (PBL). PreM showed a bimodal pattern with about half of the cells displaying high V region germline identity and enrichment for unswitched IGH, while the rest of the cells carried a mutational load similar to the bulk of GC B cells and showed a switched isotype. PBL displayed a bias toward expression of IGHG and higher V region germline identity compared to the bulk of GC B cells. Genes implicated in SHM and CSR were significantly induced in specific GC subpopulations, consistent with the occurrence of SHM in dark zone cells and suggesting that CSR can occur within the GC.",

        "Abstract": "In response to T cell-dependent antigens, mature B cells are stimulated to form germinal centers (GCs), the sites of B cell affinity maturation and the cell of origin (COO) of most B cell lymphomas. To explore the dynamics of GC B cell development beyond the known dark zone and light zone compartments, we performed single-cell (sc) transcriptomic analysis on human GC B cells and identified multiple functionally linked subpopulations, including the distinct precursors of memory B cells and plasma cells. The gene expression signatures associated with these GC subpopulations were effective in providing a sc-COO for \u223c80% of diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) and identified novel prognostic subgroups of DLBCL.",

        "Abstract": "Inactivating mutations of the CREBBP and EP300 acetyltransferases are among the most common genetic alterations in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). Here, we examined the relationship between these two enzymes in germinal center (GC) B cells, the normal counterpart of FL and DLBCL, and in lymphomagenesis by using conditional GC-directed deletion mouse models targeting Crebbp or Ep300. We found that CREBBP and EP300 modulate common as well as distinct transcriptional programs implicated in separate anatomic and functional GC compartments. Consistently, deletion of Ep300 but not Crebbp impaired the fitness of GC B cells in\u00a0vivo. Combined loss of Crebbp and Ep300 completely abrogated GC formation, suggesting that these proteins partially compensate for each other through common transcriptional targets. This synthetic lethal interaction was retained in CREBBP-mutant DLBCL cells and could be pharmacologically targeted with selective small molecule inhibitors of CREBBP and EP300 function. These data provide proof-of-principle for the clinical development of EP300-specific inhibitors in FL and DLBCL.",

Dasatinib, a multikinase inhibitor, was effective against 50% of DLBCL cell lines, as well as against in vivo xenografts. Dasatinib was more broadly active than the Bruton kinase inhibitor ibrutinib and overcame ibrutinib resistance. Tumors exhibiting dasatinib resistance were commonly characterized by activation of the PI3K pathway and loss of PTEN expression as a specific biomarker. PI3K suppression by mTORC2 inhibition synergized with dasatinib and abolished resistance in vitro and in vivo. These results provide a proof of concept for the repurposing approach in DLBCL, and point to dasatinib as an attractive strategy for further clinical development in lymphomas.",

        "Abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most frequent subtype of lymphoid malignancy, remains a significant clinical challenge, as \u223c30% of patients are not cured. Over the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease, spurred by the implementation of powerful genomic technologies that enabled the definition of its genetic and epigenetic landscape. These studies have uncovered a multitude of genomic alterations that contribute to the initiation and maintenance of the tumor clone by disrupting biological functions known to be critical for the normal biology of its cells of origin, germinal center B cells. The identified alterations involve epigenetic remodeling, block of differentiation, escape from immune surveillance, and the constitutive activation of several signal transduction pathways. This wealth of new information offers unique opportunities for the development of improved diagnostic and prognostic tools that could help guide the clinical management of DLBCL patients. Furthermore, a number of the mutated genes identified are potentially actionable targets that are currently being explored for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes current knowledge of the most common genetic alterations associated with DLBCL in relation to their functional impact on the malignant transformation process, and discusses their clinical implications for mechanism-based therapeutics.",

BCL6 protein stability is regulated by F-box protein 11 (FBXO11)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, which is impaired in \u223c6% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas that carry inactivating genetic alterations targeting the FBXO11 gene. In order to investigate the role of FBXO11 in vivo, we analyzed GC-specific FBXO11 knockout mice. FBXO11 reduction or loss led to an increased number of GC B cells, to an altered ratio of GC dark zone to light zone cells, and to higher levels of BCL6 protein in GC B cells. B-cell receptor-mediated degradation of BCL6 was reduced in the absence of FBXO11, suggesting that FBXO11 contributes to the physiologic downregulation of BCL6 at the end of the GC reaction. Finally, FBXO11 inactivation was associated with the development of lymphoproliferative disorders in mice.",

        "Abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is one of the most common and aggressive types of B-cell lymphoma. Deregulation of proto-oncogene expression after a translocation, most notably to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus (IGH), is one of the hallmarks of DLBCL. Using whole-genome sequencing analysis, we have identified the PD-L1/PD-L2 locus as a recurrent translocation partner for IGH in DLBCL. PIM1 and TP63 were also identified as novel translocation partners for PD-L1/PD-L2 Fluorescence in situ hybridization was furthermore used to rapidly screen an expanded DLBCL cohort. Collectively, a subset of samples was found to be affected by gains (12%), amplifications (3%), and translocations (4%) of the PD-L1/PD-L2 locus. RNA sequencing data coupled with immunohistochemistry revealed that these cytogenetic alterations correlated with increased expression of PD-L1 but not of PD-L2 Moreover, cytogenetic alterations affecting the PD-L1/PD-L2 locus were more frequently observed in the non-germinal center B cell-like (non-GCB) subtype of DLBCL. These findings demonstrate the genetic basis of PD-L1 overexpression in DLBCL and suggest that treatments targeting the PD-1-PD-L1/PD-L2 axis might benefit DLBCL patients, especially those belonging to the more aggressive non-GCB subtype.",

These analyses revealed that the CLL genome displays a high degree of heterogeneity between patients and within the same patient. In addition, they highlighted molecular mechanisms and functionally relevant biological programmes that may be important for the pathogenesis and therapeutic targeting of this disease. This Review focuses on recent insights into the understanding of CLL biology, with emphasis on the role of genetic lesions in the initiation and clinical progression of CLL. We also consider the translation of these findings into the development of risk-adapted and targeted therapeutic approaches.",

        "Abstract": "The pathways regulating formation of the germinal center (GC) dark zone (DZ) and light zone (LZ) are unknown. In this study we show that FOXO1 transcription factor expression was restricted to the GC DZ and was required for DZ formation, since its absence in mice led to the loss of DZ gene programs and the formation of LZ-only GCs. FOXO1-negative GC B cells displayed normal somatic hypermutation but defective affinity maturation and class switch recombination. The function of FOXO1 in sustaining the DZ program involved the trans-activation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, and cooperation with the BCL6 transcription factor in the trans-repression of genes involved in immune activation, DNA repair, and plasma cell differentiation. These results also have implications for the role of FOXO1 in lymphomagenesis because they suggest that constitutive FOXO1 activity might be required for the oncogenic activity of deregulated BCL6 expression.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in the gene encoding the KMT2D (or MLL2) methyltransferase are highly recurrent and occur early during tumorigenesis in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). However, the functional consequences of these mutations and their role in lymphomagenesis are unknown. Here we show that FL- and DLBCL-associated KMT2D mutations impair KMT2D enzymatic activity, leading to diminished global H3K4 methylation in germinal-center (GC) B cells and DLBCL cells. Conditional deletion of Kmt2d early during B cell development, but not after initiation of the GC reaction, results in an increase in GC B cells and enhances B cell proliferation in mice. Moreover, genetic ablation of Kmt2d in mice overexpressing Bcl2 increases the incidence of GC-derived lymphomas resembling human tumors. These findings suggest that KMT2D acts as a tumor suppressor gene whose early loss facilitates lymphomagenesis by remodeling the epigenetic landscape of the cancer precursor cells. Eradication of KMT2D-deficient cells may thus represent a rational therapeutic approach for targeting early tumorigenic events.",

        "Abstract": "Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a complex disease comprising diverse subtypes and genetic profiles. Possibly because of the prevalence of genetic alterations activating canonical NF-\u03baB activity, a role for oncogenic lesions that activate the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway in DLBCL has remained elusive. Here, we show that deletion/mutation of TRAF3, a negative regulator of the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway, occurs in \u223c15% of DLBCLs and that it often coexists with BCL6 translocation, which prevents terminal B cell differentiation. Accordingly, in a mouse model constitutive activation of the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway cooperates with BCL6 deregulation in DLBCL development. This work demonstrates a key oncogenic role for the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway in DLBCL development.",

Over the past decade, the rapid expansion of sequencing technologies allowing the genome-wide assessment of genomic and transcriptional changes has revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of DLBCL by providing a comprehensive and unbiased view of the genes/pathways that are disrupted by genetic alterations in this disease, and may contribute to tumor initiation and expansion. These studies uncovered the existence of several previously unappreciated alterations in key cellular pathways that may also influence treatment outcome. Indeed, a number of newly identified genetic lesions are currently being explored as markers for improved diagnosis and risk stratification, or are entering clinical trials as promising therapeutic targets. This review focuses on recent advances in the genomic characterization of DLBCL and discusses how information gained from these efforts has provided new insights into its biology, uncovering potential targets of prognostic and therapeutic relevance.",

Here we investigate whether long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes, in addition to mRNAs, are key downstream targets of oncogenic Notch1 in human T\u00a0cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). By integrating transcriptome profiles with chromatin state maps, we have uncovered many previously unreported T-ALL-specific lncRNA genes, a fraction of which are directly controlled by the Notch1/Rpbj\u03ba activator complex. Finally we have shown that one specific Notch-regulated lncRNA, LUNAR1, is required for efficient T-ALL growth in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo due to its ability to enhance IGF1R mRNA expression and sustain IGF1 signaling. These results confirm that lncRNAs are important downstream targets of the Notch signaling pathway, and additionally they are key regulators of the oncogenic state in T-ALL.",

        "Abstract": "Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), which originates from germinal center (GC) B cells and harbors translocations deregulating v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC). A comparative analysis of microRNAs expressed in normal and malignant GC B cells identified microRNA 28 (miR-28) as significantly down-regulated in BL, as well as in other GC-derived B-NHL. We show that reexpression of miR-28 impairs cell proliferation and clonogenic properties of BL cells by modulating several targets including MAD2 mitotic arrest deficient-like 1, MAD2L1, a component of the spindle checkpoint whose down-regulation is essential in mediating miR-28-induced proliferation arrest, and BCL2-associated athanogene, BAG1, an activator of the ERK pathway. We identify the oncogene MYC as a negative regulator of miR-28 expression, suggesting that its deregulation by chromosomal translocation in BL leads to miR-28 suppression. In addition, we show that miR-28 can inhibit MYC-induced transformation by directly targeting genes up-regulated by MYC. Overall, our data suggest that miR-28 acts as a tumor suppressor in BL and that its repression by MYC contributes to B-cell lymphomagenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Fludarabine refractoriness (FR) represents an unsolved clinical problem of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) management. Although next-generation sequencing studies have led to the identification of a number of genes frequently mutated in FR-CLL, a comprehensive evaluation of the FR-CLL genome has not been reported. Toward this end, we studied 10 FR-CLLs by combining whole-exome sequencing and copy number aberration (CNA) analysis, which showed an average of 16.3 somatic mutations and 4 CNAs per sample. Screening of recurrently mutated genes in 48 additional FR-CLLs revealed that ~70% of FR-CLLs carry \u22651 mutation in genes previously associated with CLL clinical course, including TP53 (27.5%), NOTCH1 (24.1%), SF3B1 (18.9%), and BIRC3 (15.5%). In addition, this analysis showed that 10.3% of FR-CLL cases display mutations of the FAT1 gene, which encodes for a cadherin-like protein that negatively regulates Wnt signaling, consistent with a tumor suppressor role. The frequency of FAT1-mutated cases was significantly higher in FR-CLL than in unselected CLLs at diagnosis (10.3% vs 1.1%, P = .004), suggesting a role in the development of a high-risk phenotype. These findings have general implications for the mechanisms leading to FR and point to Wnt signaling as a potential therapeutic target in FR-CLL.",

The pathogenesis of this process remains largely unknown. Using whole-exome sequencing and copy-number analysis, we show here that the dominant clone of FL and transformed FL (tFL) arise by divergent evolution from a common mutated precursor through the acquisition of distinct genetic events. Mutations in epigenetic modifiers and antiapoptotic genes are introduced early in the common precursor, whereas tFL is specifically associated with alterations deregulating cell-cycle progression and DNA damage responses (CDKN2A/B, MYC, and TP53) as\u00a0well as aberrant somatic hypermutation. The genomic profile of tFL shares similarities with that of germinal center B cell-type de novo DLBCL but also displays unique combinations of altered genes with diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

        "Abstract": "Richter syndrome (RS) derives from the rare transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) into an aggressive lymphoma, most commonly of the diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) type. The molecular pathogenesis of RS is only partially understood. By combining whole-exome sequencing and copy-number analysis of 9 CLL-RS pairs and of an extended panel of 43 RS cases, we show that this aggressive disease typically arises from the predominant CLL clone by acquiring an average of \u223c20 genetic lesions/case. RS lesions are heterogeneous in terms of load and spectrum among patients, and include those involved in CLL progression and chemorefractoriness (TP53 disruption and NOTCH1 activation) as well as some not previously implicated in CLL or RS pathogenesis. In particular, disruption of the CDKN2A/B cell cycle regulator is associated with \u223c30% of RS cases. Finally, we report that the genomic landscape of RS is significantly different from that of de novo DLBCL, suggesting that they represent distinct disease entities. These results provide insights into RS pathogenesis, and identify dysregulated pathways of potential diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.",

        "Abstract": "In the last decade, advances in sequencing technology and a renewed focus on the regulatory potential of RNA molecules have combined to stimulate an enormous expansion in the catalog of known eukaryotic RNAs. Beyond the sheer numerical diversity of RNA species, recent studies have begun to uncover hints of even greater functional complexity. An increasing number of RNA molecules, including those from classic, well-studied classes, have been found to act in previously unanticipated regulatory roles, or as substrate for the biogenesis of functionally distinct RNA molecules, or both. Thus, these molecules can fulfill multiple, parallel functions, compounding the already rich landscape of RNA biology, and potentially connecting disparate biological regulatory networks in unexpected ways. In this article, we review recently discovered instances of RNA multifunctionality, with a particular focus on regulatory small RNAs.",

        "Abstract": "MEF2B encodes a transcriptional activator and is mutated in \u223c11% of diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) and \u223c12% of follicular lymphomas (FLs). Here we found that MEF2B directly activated the transcription of the proto-oncogene BCL6 in normal germinal-center (GC) B cells and was required for DLBCL proliferation. Mutation of MEF2B resulted in enhanced transcriptional activity of MEF2B either through disruption of its interaction with the corepressor CABIN1 or by rendering it insensitive to inhibitory signaling events mediated by phosphorylation and sumoylation. Consequently, the transcriptional activity of Bcl-6 was deregulated in DLBCLs with MEF2B mutations. Thus, somatic mutations of MEF2B may contribute to lymphomagenesis by deregulating BCL6 expression, and MEF2B may represent an alternative target for blocking Bcl-6 activity in DLBCLs.",

        "Abstract": "Sequencing studies from several model systems have suggested that diverse and abundant small RNAs may be derived from tRNA, but the function of these molecules remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that one such tRNA-derived fragment, cloned from human mature B cells and designated CU1276, in fact possesses the functional characteristics of a microRNA, including a DICER1-dependent biogenesis, physical association with Argonaute proteins, and the ability to repress mRNA transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. Expression of CU1276 is abundant in normal germinal center B cells but absent in germinal center-derived lymphomas, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Furthermore, CU1276 represses endogenous RPA1, an essential gene involved in many aspects of DNA dynamics, and consequently, expression of this tRNA-derived microRNA in a lymphoma cell line suppresses proliferation and modulates the molecular response to DNA damage. These results establish that functionally active microRNAs can be derived from tRNA, thus defining a class of genetic entities with potentially important biological roles.",

        "Abstract": "The identification of new genetic lesions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) prompts a comprehensive and dynamic prognostic algorithm including gene mutations and chromosomal abnormalities and their changes during clonal evolution. By integrating mutational and cytogenetic analysis in 1274 CLL samples and using both a training-validation and a time-dependent design, 4 CLL subgroups were hierarchically classified: (1) high-risk, harboring TP53 and/or BIRC3 abnormalities (10-year survival: 29%); (2) intermediate-risk, harboring NOTCH1 and/or SF3B1 mutations and/or del11q22-q23 (10-year survival: 37%); (3) low-risk, harboring +12 or a normal genetics (10-year survival: 57%); and (4) very low-risk, harboring del13q14 only, whose 10-year survival (69.3%) did not significantly differ from a matched general population. This integrated mutational and cytogenetic model independently predicted survival, improved CLL prognostication accuracy compared with FISH karyotype (P < .0001), and was externally validated in an independent CLL cohort. Clonal evolution from lower to higher risk implicated the emergence of NOTCH1, SF3B1, and BIRC3 abnormalities in addition to TP53 and 11q22-q23 lesions. By taking into account clonal evolution through time-dependent analysis, the genetic model maintained its prognostic relevance at any time from diagnosis. These findings may have relevant implications for the design of clinical trials aimed at assessing the use of mutational profiling to inform therapeutic decisions.",

        "Abstract": "The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor that is required for germinal center (GC) formation and whose de-regulation is involved in lymphomagenesis. Although substantial evidence indicates that BCL6 exerts its function by repressing the transcription of hundreds of protein-coding genes, its potential role in regulating gene expression via microRNAs (miRNAs) is not known. We have identified a core of 15 miRNAs that show binding of BCL6 in their genomic loci and are down-regulated in GC B cells. Among BCL6 validated targets, miR-155 and miR-361 directly modulate AID expression, indicating that via repression of these miRNAs, BCL6 up-regulates AID. Similarly, the expression of additional genes relevant for the GC phenotype, including SPI1, IRF8, and MYB, appears to be sustained via BCL6-mediated repression of miR-155. These findings identify a novel mechanism by which BCL6, in addition to repressing protein coding genes, promotes the expression of important GC functions by repressing specific miRNAs.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults. Here, we highlight important genetic alterations that contribute to tumorigenesis, clinical progression, and chemorefractoriness of CLL. All CLLs share a common gene expression profile that suggests derivation from antigen-experienced B cells, a model supported by frequent B cell receptor repertoire skewing and stereotypy. Many CLL patients carry mutated immuno-globulin heavy-chain variable genes, while approximately 35% harbor unmutated IgV genes, which are associated with an inferior outcome. Deletion of chromosome 13q14, which is the most common genetic mutation at diagnosis, is considered an initiating lesion that frequently results in disruption of the tumor suppressor locus DLEU2/MIR15A/MIR16A. Next-generation sequencing has revealed additional recurrent genetic lesions that are implicated in CLL pathogenesis. These advancements in the molecular genetics of CLL have important implications for stratifying treatment based on molecular prognosticators and for targeted therapy.",

        "Abstract": "After antigenic challenge, B cells enter the dark zone (DZ) of germinal centers (GCs) to proliferate and hypermutate their immunoglobulin genes. Mutants with greater affinity for the antigen are positively selected in the light zone (LZ) to either differentiate into plasma and memory cells or reenter the DZ. The molecular circuits that govern positive selection in the GC are not known. We show here that the GC reaction required biphasic regulation of expression of the cell-cycle regulator c-Myc that involved its transient induction during early GC commitment, its repression by Bcl-6 in DZ B cells and its reinduction in B cells selected for reentry into the DZ. Inhibition of c-Myc in vivo led to GC collapse, which indicated an essential role for c-Myc in GCs. Our results have implications for the mechanism of GC selection and the role of c-Myc in lymphomagenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Chromosomal translocations causing deregulated c-MYC expression are detectable in most Burkitt lymphoma cases. However, little is known about the additional lesions necessary for lymphomagenesis. Now, two independent studies, one of which was performed by Sander et\u00a0al. in this issue of Cancer Cell, identify constitutive PI3K signaling and CyclinD3 mutations as cooperating lesions in both mice and humans. The results have directly actionable therapeutic implications.",

        "Abstract": "Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is a B cell malignancy of unknown pathogenesis, and thus an orphan of targeted therapies. By integrating whole-exome sequencing and copy-number analysis, we show that the SMZL exome carries at least 30 nonsilent gene alterations. Mutations in NOTCH2, a gene required for marginal-zone (MZ) B cell development, represent the most frequent lesion in SMZL, accounting for \u223c20% of cases. All NOTCH2 mutations are predicted to cause impaired degradation of the NOTCH2 protein by eliminating the C-terminal PEST domain, which is required for proteasomal recruitment. Among indolent B cell lymphoproliferative disorders, NOTCH2 mutations are restricted to SMZL, thus representing a potential diagnostic marker for this lymphoma type. In addition to NOTCH2, other modulators or members of the NOTCH pathway are recurrently targeted by genetic lesions in SMZL; these include NOTCH1, SPEN, and DTX1. We also noted mutations in other signaling pathways normally involved in MZ B cell development, suggesting that deregulation of MZ B cell development pathways plays a role in the pathogenesis of \u223c60% SMZL. These findings have direct implications for the treatment of SMZL patients, given the availability of drugs that can target NOTCH, NF-\u03baB, and other pathways deregulated in this disease.",

        "Abstract": "Germinal centers (GCs) are sites of B-cell clonal expansion, hypermutation, and selection. GCs are polarized into dark (DZ) and light zones (LZ), a distinction that is of key importance to GC selection. However, the difference between the B cells in each of these zones in humans remains unclear. We show that, as in mice, CXCR4 and CD83 can be used to distinguish human LZ and DZ cells. Using these markers, we show that LZ and DZ cells in mice and humans differ only in the expression of characteristic \"activation\" and \"proliferation\" programs, suggesting that these populations represent alternating states of a single-cell type rather than distinct differentiation stages. In addition, LZ/DZ transcriptional profiling shows that, with the exception of \"molecular\" Burkitt lymphomas, nearly all human B-cell malignancies closely resemble LZ cells, which has important implications for our understanding of the molecular programs of lymphomagenesis.",

        "Abstract": "BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor required in mature B cells during the germinal center (GC) reaction. Multiple mechanisms act coordinately to timely modulate BCL6 expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. BCL6 prevents premature activation and differentiation of GC B cells and provides an environment tolerant of the DNA breaks associated with immunoglobulin gene remodeling mechanisms involved in the production of high-affinity antibodies of different isotypes. The critical functions exerted by BCL6 during normal B-cell development can be hijacked by the malignant transformation process. Indeed, BCL6 is targeted by genetic aberrations and acts as an oncogene in GC-derived lymphomas. The aberrations affecting BCL6 interfere with the multiple levels of regulation that grant a fine tuning of BCL6 expression and activity in physiologic conditions. This review summarizes the current knowledge on BCL6 function and its role in lymphomagenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Recent developments in extracting and processing biological and clinical data are allowing quantitative approaches to studying living systems. High-throughput sequencing (HTS), expression profiles, proteomics, and electronic health records (EHR) are some examples of such technologies. Extracting meaningful information from those technologies requires careful analysis of the large volumes of data they produce. In this note, we present a set of fractal-like distributions that commonly appear in the analysis of such data. The first set of examples are drawn from a HTS experiment. Here, the distributions appear as part of the evaluation of the error rate of the sequencing and the identification of tumorogenic genomic alterations. The other examples are obtained from risk factor evaluation and analysis of relative disease prevalence and co-mordbidity as these appear in EHR. The distributions are also relevant to identification of subclonal populations in tumors and the study of quasi-species and intrahost diversity of viral populations.",

        "Abstract": "The genetic lesions identified to date do not fully recapitulate the molecular pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and do not entirely explain the development of severe complications such as chemorefractoriness. In the present study, BIRC3, a negative regulator of noncanonical NF-\u03baB signaling, was investigated in different CLL clinical phases. BIRC3 lesions were absent in monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (0 of 63) and were rare in CLL at diagnosis (13 of 306, 4%). Conversely, BIRC3 disruption selectively affected 12 of 49 (24%) fludarabine-refractory CLL cases by inactivating mutations and/or gene deletions that distributed in a mutually exclusive fashion with TP53 abnormalities. In contrast to fludarabine-refractory CLL, progressive but fludarabine-sensitive patients were consistently devoid of BIRC3 abnormalities, suggesting that BIRC3 genetic lesions associate specifically with a chemorefractory phenotype. By actuarial analysis in newly diagnosed CLL (n = 306), BIRC3 disruption identified patients with a poor outcome similar to that associated with TP53 abnormalities and exerted a prognostic role that was independent of widely accepted clinical and genetic risk factors. Consistent with the role of BIRC3 as a negative regulator of NF-\u03baB, biochemical studies revealed the presence of constitutive noncanonical NF-\u03baB activation in fludarabine-refractory CLL patients harboring molecular lesions of BIRC3. These data identify BIRC3 disruption as a recurrent genetic lesion of high-risk CLL devoid of TP53 abnormalities.",

        "Abstract": "Deletion of chromosomal region 13q14 represents the most common genetic aberration in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). 13q14 deletions are commonly large and heterogeneous in size and affect multiple genes. We recently found that targeted deletion in mice of the 0.11 megabase (mb)-long minimal deleted region (MDR) encompassing the DLEU2/miR-15a/16-1 cluster recapitulates the spectrum of CLL-associated lymphoproliferations in humans, including CLL, CD5(+) monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, and CD5(-) non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In the present study, we demonstrate that additional deletion of the 0.69-mb large genomic region telomeric to the MDR called the common deleted region (CDR) changed the spectrum of lymphoproliferations developing in CDR- versus MDR-deleted mice in that the number of CLL among B-cell lymphoproliferations was significantly elevated in the former. In addition, CDR-deleted mice seemed to succumb to their disease faster than MDR-deleted mice. Comparing HCDR3 regions of CD5(+) lymphoproliferations derived from this and published CLL mouse models, 44% (29 of 66) of junctions could be assigned to 8 sets of highly similar HCDR3 regions, demonstrating that CLL developing in mice frequently expresses almost identical, stereotypic Ag receptors. These results suggest that the size of 13q14 deletions influences the phenotype of the developing lymphoproliferations and potentially the severity of disease, suggesting a tumor-suppressor function for genetic elements in addition to DLEU2/miR-15a/16-1.",

        "Abstract": "We report that diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) commonly fails to express cell-surface molecules necessary for the recognition of tumor cells by immune-effector cells. In 29% of cases, mutations and deletions inactivate the \u03b22-Microglobulin gene, thus preventing the cell-surface expression of the HLA class-I (HLA-I) complex that is necessary for recognition by CD8(+) cytotoxic T\u00a0cells. In 21% of cases, analogous lesions\u00a0involve the CD58 gene, which encodes a molecule involved in T and natural killer cell-mediated responses. In addition to gene inactivation, alternative mechanisms lead to aberrant expression of HLA-I and CD58 in >60% of DLBCL. These two events are significantly associated in this disease, suggesting that they are coselected during lymphomagenesis for their combined role in escape from immune-surveillance.",

        "Abstract": "Analysis of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) coding genome has recently disclosed that the NOTCH1 proto-oncogene is recurrently mutated at CLL presentation. Here, we assessed the prognostic role of NOTCH1 mutations in CLL. Two series of newly diagnosed CLL were used as training (n = 309) and validation (n = 230) cohorts. NOTCH1 mutations occurred in 11.0% and 11.3% CLL of the training and validation series, respectively. In the training series, NOTCH1 mutations led to a 3.77-fold increase in the hazard of death and to shorter overall survival (OS; P < .001). Multivariate analysis selected NOTCH1 mutations as an independent predictor of OS after controlling for confounding clinical and biologic variables. The independent prognostic value of NOTCH1 mutations was externally confirmed in the validation series. The poor prognosis conferred by NOTCH1 mutations was attributable, at least in part, to shorter treatment-free survival and higher risk of Richter transformation. Although NOTCH1 mutated patients were devoid of TP53 disruption in more than 90% cases in both training and validation series, the OS predicted by NOTCH1 mutations was similar to that of TP53 mutated/deleted CLL. NOTCH1 mutations are an independent predictor of CLL OS, tend to be mutually exclusive with TP53 abnormalities, and identify cases with a dismal prognosis.",

        "Abstract": "The genetic lesions identified in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) do not entirely recapitulate the disease pathogenesis and the development of serious complications, such as chemorefractoriness. While investigating the coding genome of fludarabine-refractory CLL, we observed that mutations of SF3B1, encoding a splicing factor and representing a critical component of the cell spliceosome, were recurrent in 10 of 59 (17%) fludarabine-refractory cases, with a frequency significantly greater than that observed in a consecutive CLL cohort sampled at diagnosis (17/301, 5%; P = .002). Mutations were somatically acquired, were generally represented by missense nucleotide changes, clustered in selected HEAT repeats of the SF3B1 protein, recurrently targeted 3 hotspots (codons 662, 666, and 700), and were predictive of a poor prognosis. In fludarabine-refractory CLL, SF3B1 mutations and TP53 disruption distributed in a mutually exclusive fashion (P = .046). The identification of SF3B1 mutations points to splicing regulation as a novel pathogenetic mechanism of potential clinical relevance in CLL.",

        "Abstract": "Three distinct categories of marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs) are currently recognized, principally based on their site of occurrence. They are thought to represent unique entities, but the relationship of one subtype with another is poorly understood. We investigated 17 non-splenic MZLs (seven nodal, 10 extranodal) by gene expression profiling to distinguish between subtypes and determine their cell of origin. Our findings suggest biological inter-relatedness of these entities despite occurrence at different locations and associations with possibly different aetiologies. Furthermore, the expression profiles of non-splenic MZL were similar to memory B cells.",

        "Abstract": "Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is one of the few B-cell lymphoma types that remain orphan of molecular lesions in cancer-related genes. Detection of active NF-\u03baB signaling in 14 (58%) of 24 SMZLs prompted the investigation of NF-\u03baB molecular alterations in 101 SMZLs. Mutations and copy number abnormalities of NF-\u03baB genes occurred in 36 (36%) of 101 SMZLs and targeted both canonical (TNFAIP3 and IKBKB) and noncanonical (BIRC3, TRAF3, MAP3K14) NF-\u03baB pathways. Most alterations were mutually exclusive, documenting the existence of multiple independent mechanisms affecting NF-\u03baB in SMZL. BIRC3 inactivation in SMZL recurred because of somatic mutations that disrupted the same RING domain that in extranodal marginal zone lymphoma is removed by the t(11;18) translocation, which points to BIRC3 disruption as a common mechanism across marginal zone B-cell lymphomagenesis. Genetic lesions of NF-\u03baB provide a molecular basis for the pathogenesis of more than 30% of SMZLs and offer a suitable target for NF-\u03baB therapeutic approaches in this lymphoma.",

By combining next-generation sequencing and copy number analysis, we show that the DLBCL coding genome contains, on average, more than 30 clonally represented gene alterations per case. This analysis also revealed mutations in genes not previously implicated in DLBCL pathogenesis, including those regulating chromatin methylation (MLL2; 24% of samples) and immune recognition by T cells.

The full spectrum of genetic lesions that are present in the CLL genome, and therefore the number and identity of dysregulated cellular pathways, have not been identified. By combining next-generation sequencing and copy number analysis, we show here that the typical CLL coding genome contains <20 clonally represented gene alterations/case, including predominantly nonsilent mutations, and fewer copy number aberrations. These analyses led to the discovery of several genes not previously known to be altered in CLL. Although most of these genes were affected at low frequency in an expanded CLL screening cohort, mutational activation of NOTCH1, observed in 8.3% of CLL at diagnosis, was detected at significantly higher frequency during disease progression toward Richter transformation (31.0%), as well as in chemorefractory CLL (20.8%). Consistent with the association of NOTCH1 mutations with clinically aggressive forms of the disease, NOTCH1 activation at CLL diagnosis emerged as an independent predictor of poor survival. These results provide initial data on the complexity of the CLL coding genome and identify a dysregulated pathway of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.",

        "Abstract": "B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma comprises biologically and clinically distinct diseases the pathogenesis of which is associated with genetic lesions affecting oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes. We report here that the two most common types--follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma--harbour frequent structural alterations inactivating CREBBP and, more rarely, EP300, two highly related histone and non-histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that act as transcriptional co-activators in multiple signalling pathways. Overall, about 39% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 41% of follicular lymphoma cases display genomic deletions and/or somatic mutations that remove or inactivate the HAT coding domain of these two genes. These lesions usually affect one allele, suggesting that reduction in HAT dosage is important for lymphomagenesis. We demonstrate specific defects in acetylation-mediated inactivation of the BCL6 oncoprotein and activation of the p53 tumour suppressor. These results identify CREBBP/EP300 mutations as a major pathogenetic mechanism shared by common forms of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with direct implications for the use of drugs targeting acetylation/deacetylation mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "We utilized gene expression profiling of a comprehensive panel of purified developmentally defined normal murine B cells to identify unique transcriptional signatures for each subset. To elucidate transcription factor activities that function in a stage-specific fashion, we used gene sets that share transcription factor targets and found that germinal center B cells had a robust enrichment of up-regulated and down-regulated signatures compared with the other B-cell subsets. Notably, we found Yy1 and its targets to be central regulators of the germinal center B (GCB)-specific transcriptional program with binding of Yy1 to select signature genes in GCB cells, and translation of the Yy1 signatures to human GCB cells. We then tested whether our newly generated, stage-specific transcriptional signatures could be used to link murine lymphoma models to stages of normal B-cell development. Although each of the molecularly defined murine lymphoma models conserved certain stage-specific features of normal B-cell development, there was a significant alteration of the normal differentiation signature following malignant transformation. These findings offer important tools and insights for elucidating differences between normal and malignant B cells.",

        "Abstract": "Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous disease composed of at least two distinct subtypes: germinal center B cell-like (GCB) and activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. These phenotypic subtypes segregate with largely unique genetic lesions, suggesting the involvement of different pathogenetic mechanisms. In this report we show that the BLIMP1/PRDM1 gene is inactivated by multiple mechanisms, including homozygous deletions, truncating or missense mutations, and transcriptional repression by constitutively active BCL6, in \u223c53% of ABC-DLBCL. In vivo, conditional deletion of Blimp1 in mouse B cells promotes the development of lymphoproliferative disorders recapitulating critical features of the human ABC-DLBCL. These results demonstrate that BLIMP1 is a bona fide tumor-suppressor gene whose loss contributes to lymphomagenesis by blocking plasma cell differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "Marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZLs) have been divided into 3 distinct subtypes (extranodal MZLs of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT] type, nodal MZLs, and splenic MZLs). Nevertheless, the relationship between the subtypes is still unclear. We performed a comprehensive analysis of genomic DNA copy number changes in a very large series of MZL cases with the aim of addressing this question. Samples from 218 MZL patients (25 nodal, 57 MALT, 134 splenic, and 2 not better specified MZLs) were analyzed with the Affymetrix Human Mapping 250K SNP arrays, and the data combined with matched gene expression in 33 of 218 cases. MALT lymphoma presented significantly more frequently gains at 3p, 6p, 18p, and del(6q23) (TNFAIP3/A20), whereas splenic MZLs was associated with del(7q31), del(8p). Nodal MZLs did not show statistically significant differences compared with MALT lymphoma while lacking the splenic MZLs-related 7q losses. Gains of 3q and 18q were common to all 3 subtypes. del(8p) was often present together with del(17p) (TP53). Although del(17p) did not determine a worse outcome and del(8p) was only of borderline significance, the presence of both deletions had a highly significant negative impact on the outcome of splenic MZLs.",

        "Title": "New insights into the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",
        "Abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an incurable disease of the elderly, stands out as unique among the malignancies derived from mature B lymphocytes. The histology, immunophenotype, immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) gene somatic hypermutation status, and the pattern of genetic alterations of the tumor cells are markedly distinct from that of any other B-cell tumor. Most notably, CLL cases can have somatically mutated as well as unmutated IgV genes which largely correlate with a favorable and unfavorable clinical prognosis, respectively. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that 6% of the normal elderly population develops a monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) that appears as the precursor to CLL in 1-2% of cases. Over the last decade, global gene expression profile analysis was instrumental in defining CLL as a malignancy originating from the oncogenic transformation of a common cellular precursor that resembles an antigen-experienced B cell. These findings were complemented by the realization that all CLL, independent of their IgV gene somatic mutation status, express B-cell receptors (BCRs) that show evidence of antigen-experience. Indeed, the BCRs of CLL cases among different individuals can be similar to the extent that one was able to define subsets of stereotyped receptors based on the homology in the antigen-binding regions. Together, these observations strongly support the notion that antigen plays a critical role in CLL pathogenesis. This role is complemented by genetic alterations that, analogous to most cancer types, represent the initiating pathogenetic event. In fact, CLL cases display recurrent genetic aberrations including trisomy 12 and monoallelic or biallelic deletion/inactivation of chromosomal regions 17p, 11q and 13q14. However, virtually all CLL cases lack balanced reciprocal chromosomal translocations, the genetic hallmark of germinal center (GC)-derived lymphomas. The most frequent genetic aberration in CLL, deletion of chromosomal region 13q14, was recently shown to have a specific role in CLL pathogenesis. This region encodes a tumor suppressor locus comprising a microRNA cluster embedded in a long sterile RNA gene, whose deletion in the mouse leads to lymphoproliferative syndromes recapitulating the human CLL-associated spectrum, including MBL, CLL and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). This review will focus on the cellular origin of CLL, its relationship to the mechanisms of generating CLL-associated genetic lesions and on the role of the 13q14 deletion in CLL pathogenesis as emerging from the analysis of a newly generated mouse model.",

Eighty percent of genes jointly regulated by these transcription factors are activated in the GC, including those encoding proteins in a complex regulating DNA pre-replication, replication, and mitosis. These results indicate that the HBCI analysis can be used for the identification of determinants of major human cell phenotypes and provides a paradigm of general applicability to normal and pathologic tissues.",

        "Title": "BCL6: master regulator of the germinal center reaction and key oncogene in B cell lymphomagenesis.",
        "Abstract": "BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor which has emerged as a critical regulator of germinal centers (GC), the sites where B cells are selected based on the production of antibodies with high affinity for the antigen. BCL6 is also a frequently activated oncogene in the pathogenesis of human B cell lymphomas, most of which derive from the GC B cells. A thorough understanding of the biological role of BCL6 in normal B cell development and lymphomagenesis depends upon the identification of the full set of genes that are targets of its transcriptional regulatory function. Recently, the identification of BCL6 targets has been implemented with the use of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and gene expression profiling approaches. A large set of promoters have been shown to be physically bound by BCL6, but only a fraction of them appears to be subjected to transcriptional repression in GC B cells. This set of BCL6 targets points to a number of cellular functions which are likely to be directly controlled by BCL6 during GC development, including activation, survival, DNA-damage response, cell cycle arrest, cytokine-, toll-like receptor-, TGFbeta-, WNT-signaling, and differentiation. Overall, BCL6 is revealing its dual role of \"safe-keeper\" in preventing centroblasts from responding to signals leading to a premature exit from the GC and of contributor to lymphomagenesis by allowing the instauration of conditions favorable to malignant transformation.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignancy of B cells of unknown etiology. Deletions of the chromosomal region 13q14 are commonly associated with CLL, with monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL), which occasionally precedes CLL, and with aggressive lymphoma, suggesting that this region contains a tumor-suppressor gene. Here, we demonstrate that deletion in mice of the 13q14-minimal deleted region (MDR), which encodes the DLEU2/miR-15a/16-1 cluster, causes development of indolent B cell-autonomous, clonal lymphoproliferative disorders, recapitulating the spectrum of CLL-associated phenotypes observed in humans. miR-15a/16-1-deletion accelerates the proliferation of both human and mouse B cells by modulating the expression of genes controlling cell-cycle progression. These results define the role of 13q14 deletions in the pathogenesis of CLL.",

        "Abstract": "BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor required for mature B-cell germinal center (GC) formation and implicated in lymphomagenesis. BCL6's physiologic function is only partially known because the complete set of its targets in GC B cells has not been identified. To address this issue, we used an integrated biochemical-computational-functional approach to identify BCL6 direct targets in normal GC B cells. This approach includes (1) identification of BCL6-bound promoters by genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation, (2) inference of transcriptional relationships by the use of a regulatory network reverse engineering approach (ARACNe), and (3) validation of physiologic relevance of the candidate targets down-regulated in GC B cells. Our approach demonstrated that a large set of promoters (> 4000) is physically bound by BCL6 but that only a fraction of them is repressed in GC B cells. This set of 1207 targets identifies several cellular functions directly controlled by BCL6 during GC development, including activation, survival, DNA-damage response, cell cycle arrest, cytokine signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, and differentiation. These results define a broad role of BCL6 in preventing centroblasts from responding to signals leading to exit from the GC before they complete the phase of proliferative expansion and of antibody affinity maturation.",

        "Abstract": "S1P(2) sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor signaling can regulate proliferation, survival, morphology, and migration in many cell types in vitro. Here, we report that S1P(2)(-/-) mice develop clonal B-cell lymphomas with age, such that approximately half of the animals display this neoplasm by 1.5 to 2 years of age. Histologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular analyses revealed a uniform tumor phenotype with features of germinal center (GC)-derived diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Tumor formation was preceded by increases in GC B cells and CD69(+) T cells, as well as an increased formation of spontaneous GCs, suggesting that S1P(2) loss may promote lymphomagenesis in part by disrupting GC B-cells homeostasis. With the sole exception of rare lung tumors, the effect of S1P(2) gene disruption is remarkably restricted to DLBCL. In humans, 28 of 106 (26%) DLBCL samples were found to harbor multiple somatic mutations in the 5' sequences of the S1P(2) gene. Mutations displayed features resembling those generated by the IgV-associated somatic hypermutation mechanism, but were not detected at significant levels in normal GC B cells, indicating a tumor-associated aberrant function. Collectively, our data suggest that S1P(2) signaling may play a critical role in suppressing DLBCL formation in vivo. The high incidence of DLBCL in S1P(2)(-/-) mice, its onset at old age, and the relative lack of other neoplasms identify these mice as a novel, and potentially valuable, model for this highly prevalent and aggressive human malignancy.",

        "Abstract": "Tonic B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is a key survival pathway during normal B-cell ontogenesis and in a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). We previously demonstrated that BCR-dependent DLBCL cell lines and primary tumors underwent apoptosis after treatment with an ATP-competitive inhibitor of the BCR-associated spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK). These \"BCR-type\" tumors also have more abundant expression of the transcriptional repressor, BCL6, and increased sensitivity to BCL6 inhibition. Herein, we evaluated potential connections between BCL6-mediated transcriptional repression and SYK-dependent BCR signaling. In transcriptionally profiled normal B-cell subsets (naive, germinal center, and memory B cells) and in primary DLBCLs, there were reciprocal patterns of expression of BCL6 and the SYK tyrosine phosphatase PTPROt. BCL6 repressed PTPROt transcription via a direct interaction with functional BCL6 binding sites in the PTPROt promoter. Enforced expression of BCL6 in normal naive B cells and RNAi-mediated depletion of BCL6 in germinal center B cells directly modulated PTPROt expression. In \"BCR-type\" DLBCLs, BCL6 depletion increased PTPROt expression and decreased phosphorylation of SYK and the downstream adaptor protein BLNK. Because BCL6 augments BCR signaling and BCL6 and SYK are both promising therapeutic targets in many DLBCLs, combined inhibition of these functionally related pathways warrants further study.",

However, high-throughput methods for the identification of proteins that affect TF activity are still largely unavailable. Here we introduce an algorithm, modulator inference by network dynamics (MINDy), for the genome-wide identification of post-translational modulators of TF activity within a specific cellular context. When used to dissect the regulation of MYC activity in human B lymphocytes, the approach inferred novel modulators of MYC function, which act by distinct mechanisms, including protein turnover, transcription complex formation and selective enzyme recruitment. MINDy is generally applicable to study the post-translational modulation of mammalian TFs in any cellular context. As such it can be used to dissect context-specific signaling pathways and combinatorial transcriptional regulation.",

        "Abstract": "The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor that is required for germinal center (GC) formation and whose deregulation by genomic lesions is implicated in the pathogenesis of GC-derived diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and, less frequently, follicular lymphoma (FL). The biological function of BCL6 is only partially understood because no more than a few genes have been functionally characterized as direct targets of BCL6 transrepression activity. Here we report that the anti-apoptotic proto-oncogene BCL2 is a direct target of BCL6 in GC B cells. BCL6 binds to the BCL2 promoter region by interacting with the transcriptional activator Miz1 and suppresses Miz1-induced activation of BCL2 expression. BCL6-mediated suppression of BCL2 is lost in FL and DLBCL, where the 2 proteins are pathologically coexpressed, because of BCL2 chromosomal translocations and other mechanisms, including Miz1 deregulation and somatic mutations in the BCL2 promoter region. These results identify an important function for BCL6 in facilitating apoptosis of GC B cells via suppression of BCL2, and suggest that blocking this pathway is critical for lymphomagenesis.",

        "Abstract": "The full set of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the human genome is not known. Because presently known miRNAs have been identified by virtue of their abundant expression in a few cell types, many tissue-specific miRNAs remain unrevealed. To understand the role of miRNAs in B cell function and lymphomagenesis, we generated short-RNA libraries from normal human B cells at different stages of development (naive, germinal center, memory) and from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line. A combination of cloning and computational analysis identified 178 miRNAs (miRNome) expressed in normal and/or transformed B cell libraries. Most notably, the B cell miRNome included 75 miRNAs which to our knowledge have not been previously reported and of which 66 have been validated by RNA blot and/or RT-PCR analyses. Numerous miRNAs were expressed in a stage- or transformation-specific fashion in B cells, suggesting specific functional or pathologic roles. These results provide a resource for studying the role of miRNAs in B cell development, immune function, and lymphomagenesis.",

        "Title": "Mutations of multiple genes cause deregulation of NF-kappaB in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.",
        "Abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common form of lymphoma in adulthood, comprises multiple biologically and clinically distinct subtypes including germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. Gene expression profile studies have shown that its most aggressive subtype, ABC-DLBCL, is associated with constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB transcription complex. However, except for a small fraction of cases, it remains unclear whether NF-kappaB activation in these tumours represents an intrinsic program of the tumour cell of origin or a pathogenetic event. Here we show that >50% of ABC-DLBCL and a smaller fraction of GCB-DLBCL carry somatic mutations in multiple genes, including negative (TNFAIP3, also called A20) and positive (CARD11, TRAF2, TRAF5, MAP3K7 (TAK1) and TNFRSF11A (RANK)) regulators of NF-kappaB. Of these, the A20 gene, which encodes a ubiquitin-modifying enzyme involved in termination of NF-kappaB responses, is most commonly affected, with approximately 30% of patients displaying biallelic inactivation by mutations and/or deletions. When reintroduced in cell lines carrying biallelic inactivation of the gene, A20 induced apoptosis and cell growth arrest, indicating a tumour suppressor role. Less frequently, missense mutations of TRAF2 and CARD11 produce molecules with significantly enhanced ability to activate NF-kappaB. Thus, our results demonstrate that NF-kappaB activation in DLBCL is caused by genetic lesions affecting multiple genes, the loss or activation of which may promote lymphomagenesis by leading to abnormally prolonged NF-kappaB responses.",

        "Abstract": "Unique and shared cytogenetic abnormalities have been documented for marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs) arising at different sites. Recently, homozygous deletions of the chromosomal band 6q23, involving the tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, A20) gene, a negative regulator of NF-kappaB, were described in ocular adnexal MZL, suggesting a role for A20 as a tumor suppressor in this disease. Here, we investigated inactivation of A20 by DNA mutations or deletions in a panel of extranodal MZL (EMZL), nodal MZL (NMZL), and splenic MZL (SMZL). Inactivating mutations encoding truncated A20 proteins were identified in 6 (19%) of 32 MZLs, including 2 (18%) of 11 EMZLs, 3 (33%) of 9 NMZLs, and 1 (8%) of 12 SMZLs. Two additional unmutated nonsplenic MZLs also showed monoallelic or biallelic A20 deletions by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or SNP-arrays. Thus, A20 inactivation by either somatic mutation and/or deletion represents a common genetic aberration across all MZL subtypes, which may contribute to lymphomagenesis by inducing constitutive NF-kappaB activation.",

        "Abstract": "A key role of signal transduction pathways is to control transcriptional programs in the nucleus as a function of signals received by the cell via complex post-translational modification cascades. This determines cell-context specific responses to environmental stimuli. Given the difficulty of quantitating protein concentration and post-translational modifications, signaling pathway studies are still for the most part conducted one interaction at the time. Thus, genome-wide, cell-context specific dissection of signaling pathways is still an open challenge in molecular systems biology. In this manuscript we extend the MINDy algorithm for the identification of posttranslational modulators of transcription factor activity, to produce a first genome-wide map of the interface between signaling and transcriptional regulatory programs in human B cells. We show that the serine-threonine kinase STK38 emerges as the most pleiotropic signaling protein in this cellular context and we biochemically validate this finding by shRNA-mediated silencing of this kinase, followed by gene expression profile analysis. We also extensively validate the inferred interactions using protein-protein interaction databases and the kinase-substrate interaction prediction algorithm NetworKIN.",

        "Abstract": "B-cell post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are classified as early lesions, polymorphic lymphomas (P-PTLD) and monomorphic lymphomas (M-PTLD). These morphologic categories are thought to reflect a biologic continuum, although supporting genetic data are lacking. To gain better insights into PTLD pathogenesis, we characterized the phenotypes, immunoglobulin (Ig) gene alterations and non-Ig gene (BCL6, RhoH/TTF, c-MYC, PAX5, CIITA, BCL7A, PIM1) mutations of 21 PTLD, including an IM-like lesion, 8 P-PTLD and 12 M-PTLD. Gene expression profile analysis was also performed in 12 cases. All PTLD with clonal Ig rearrangements showed evidence of germinal centre (GC) transit based on the analysis of Ig and BCL6 gene mutations, and 74% had a non-GC phenotype (BCL6 +/- MUM1+). Although surface Ig abnormalities were seen in 6/19 (32%) PTLD, only three showed 'crippling' Ig mutations indicating other etiologies for loss of the B-cell receptor. Aberrant somatic hypermutation (ASHM) was almost exclusively observed in M-PTLD (8/12 vs. 1/8 P-PTLD) and all three recurrent cases analysed showed additional mutations in genes targeted by ASHM. Gene expression analysis showed distinct clustering of PTLD compared to B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL) without segregation of P-PTLD from non-GC M-PTLD or EBV+ from EBV- PTLD. The gene expression pattern of PTLD appeared more related to that of memory and activated B-cells. Together, our results suggest that PTLD represent a distinct type of B-NHL deriving from an antigen experienced B-cell, whose evolution is associated with accrual of genetic lesions.",

        "Abstract": "The computational identification of oncogenic lesions is still a key open problem in cancer biology. Although several methods have been proposed, they fail to model how such events are mediated by the network of molecular interactions in the cell. In this paper, we introduce a systems biology approach, based on the analysis of molecular interactions that become dysregulated in specific tumor phenotypes. Such a strategy provides important insights into tumorigenesis, effectively extending and complementing existing methods. Furthermore, we show that the same approach is highly effective in identifying the targets of molecular perturbations in a human cellular context, a task virtually unaddressed by existing computational methods. To identify interactions that are dysregulated in three distinct non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and in samples perturbed with CD40 ligand, we use the B-cell interactome (BCI), a genome-wide compendium of human B-cell molecular interactions, in combination with a large set of microarray expression profiles. The method consistently ranked the known gene in the top 20 (0.3%), outperforming conventional approaches in 3 of 4 cases.",

        "Abstract": "Most human B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHLs) derive from germinal centers (GCs), the structure in which B cells undergo somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) before being selected for high-affinity antibody production. The pathogenesis of B-NHL is associated with distinct genetic lesions, including chromosomal translocations and aberrant SHM, which arise from mistakes occurring during CSR and SHM. A direct link between these DNA remodeling events and GC lymphoma development, however, has not been demonstrated. Here we have crossed three mouse models of B cell lymphoma driven by oncogenes (Myc, Bcl6 and Myc/Bcl6; refs. 5,6) with mice lacking activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), the enzyme required for both CSR and SHM. We show that AID deficiency prevents Bcl6-dependent, GC-derived B-NHL, but has no impact on Myc-driven, pre-GC lymphomas. Accordingly, abrogation of AID is associated with the disappearance of CSR- and SHM-mediated structural alterations. These results show that AID is required for GC-derived lymphomagenesis, supporting the notion that errors in AID-mediated antigen-receptor gene modification processes are principal contributors to the pathogenesis of human B-NHL.",

        "Abstract": "The chemokine receptor CXCR4 plays a central role in organ-specific homing and tumor spreading and is induced by hypoxia. B lymphocytes are exposed to low oxygen tensions during their development, but the influence of hypoxia on their physiology is poorly understood. Here, we show that hypoxia is associated with up-regulation of CXCR4 expression in human normal and malignant B cells, through both transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms. However, a dichotomic functional response to CXCR4 triggering was observed: both peripheral B cells and lymphomas arising from mature B cells displayed increased responses to CXCR4 triggering under hypoxia, whereas germinal center (GC) B cells as well as GC-derived lymphomas showed CXCR4 receptor desensitization. This phenomenon was associated with differential modulation of key signal-transducing molecules, including mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 and regulator of G protein signaling molecule-1. The unresponsiveness of GC-derived lymphomatous B cells to CXCR4 triggering under hypoxia may have implications for the development and pathogenesis of GC-derived lymphoid tumors.",

        "Abstract": "Antigen-specific B cells are selected in germinal centers, the structure in which these cells proliferate while accomplishing genome-remodeling processes such as class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. These events are associated with considerable genotoxic stress, which cells tolerate through suppression of DNA-damage responses by Bcl-6, a transcription factor required for the formation of germinal centers. Here we show that the expression of Bcl-6 is regulated by DNA damage through a signaling pathway that promotes Bcl-6 degradation. After DNA damage accumulated, the kinase ATM promoted Bcl-6 phosphorylation, leading to its interaction with the isomerase Pin1 and its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Because Bcl-6 is required for the maintenance of germinal centers, our findings suggest that the extent of genotoxic stress controls the fate of germinal center B cells by means of Bcl-6.",

        "Abstract": "The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor necessary for the development of germinal centers (GCs) and directly implicated in lymphomagenesis. Post-GC development of B cells requires BCL6 downregulation, while its constitutive expression caused by chromosomal translocations leads to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Herein we identify a signaling pathway that downregulates BCL6 expression in normal GC B cells and is blocked in a subset of DLBCL due to alterations in the BCL6 gene. Activation of the CD40 receptor leads to NF-kappaB-mediated induction of the IRF4 transcription factor, which, in turn, represses BCL6 expression by binding to its promoter region. A subset of DLBCL displays chromosomal translocations or mutations that disrupt the IRF4-responsive region in the BCL6 promoter and block its downregulation by CD40 signaling.",

However, the biological functions required by c-Myc to induce oncogenesis remain elusive. Here we show that c-Myc has a direct role in the control of DNA replication. c-Myc interacts with the pre-replicative complex and localizes to early sites of DNA synthesis. Depletion of c-Myc from mammalian (human and mouse) cells as well as from Xenopus cell-free extracts, which are devoid of RNA transcription, demonstrates a non-transcriptional role for c-Myc in the initiation of DNA replication. Overexpression of c-Myc causes increased replication origin activity with subsequent DNA damage and checkpoint activation. These findings identify a critical function of c-Myc in DNA replication and suggest a novel mechanism for its normal and oncogenic functions.",

        "Abstract": "The BCL6 transcriptional repressor is the most commonly involved oncogene in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). Constitutive expression of BCL6 mediates lymphomagenesis through aberrant proliferation, survival, and differentiation blockade. Binding of BCL6 to the SMRT/N-CoR corepressors mediates the BCL6 survival effect in DLBCL. Although the basis for differentiation blockade is unknown in DLBCL, recent data suggest that BCL6 binding to the MTA3 corepressor might be involved. We report that BCL6 and MTA3 are coexpressed in normal germinal center B cells and DLBCL. Depletion of MTA3 in DLBCL cells induced a differentiation-related BCL6 target gene (PRDM1), but not target genes involved in survival. Accordingly, MTA3 and PRDM1 expression are mutually exclusive in germinal center B cells. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-chip mapping of the PRDM1 locus, identifying a novel BCL6 binding site on intron 3 of the PRDM1 gene, and show that BCL6 recruits MTA3 to this site. In DLBCL cells, MTA3 depletion induced plasmacytic differentiation but did not decrease viability of DLBCL cells. However, MTA3 depletion synergized with a specific BCL6 inhibitor that blocks SMRT/N-CoR binding to decrease DLBCL viability. Taken together, these results show that BCL6 regulates distinct transcriptional programs through the SMRT/N-CoR and MTA3 corepressors, respectively, and provides a basis for combinatorial therapeutic targeting of BCL6.",

        "Abstract": "Peripheral T cell lymphoma, unspecified (PTCL/U), the most common form of PTCL, displays heterogeneous morphology and phenotype, poor response to treatment, and poor prognosis. We demonstrate that PTCL/U shows a gene expression profile clearly distinct from that of normal T cells. Comparison with the profiles of purified T cell subpopulations (CD4+, CD8+, resting [HLA-DR-], and activated [HLA-DR+]) reveals that PTCLs/U are most closely related to activated peripheral T lymphocytes, either CD4+ or CD8+. Interestingly, the global gene expression profile cannot be surrogated by routine CD4/CD8 immunohistochemistry. When compared with normal T cells, PTCLs/U display deregulation of functional programs often involved in tumorigenesis (e.g., apoptosis, proliferation, cell adhesion, and matrix remodeling). Products of deregulated genes can be detected in PTCLs/U by immunohistochemistry with an ectopic, paraphysiologic, or stromal location. PTCLs/U aberrantly express, among others, PDGFRalpha, a tyrosine-kinase receptor, whose deregulation is often related to a malignant phenotype. Notably, both phosphorylation of PDGFRalpha and sensitivity of cultured PTCL cells to imatinib (as well as to an inhibitor of histone deacetylase) were found. These results, which might be extended to other more rare PTCL categories, provide insight into tumor pathogenesis and clinical management of PTCL/U.",

        "Abstract": "B cells producing high-affinity antibodies are destined to differentiate into memory B cells and plasma cells, but the mechanisms leading to those differentiation pathways are mostly unknown. Here we report that the transcription factor IRF4 is required for the generation of plasma cells. Transgenic mice with conditional deletion of Irf4 in germinal center B cells lacked post-germinal center plasma cells and were unable to differentiate memory B cells into plasma cells. Plasma cell differentiation required IRF4 as well as the transcriptional repressor Blimp-1, which both acted 'upstream' of the transcription factor XBP-1. In addition, IRF4-deficient B cells had impaired expression of activation-induced deaminase and lacked class-switch recombination, suggesting an independent function for IRF4 in this process. These results identify IRF4 as a crucial transcriptional 'switch' in the generation of functionally competent plasma cells.",

Existing computational methods for the genome-wide \"reverse engineering\" of such networks have been successful only for lower eukaryotes with simple genomes. Here we present ARACNE, a novel algorithm, using microarray expression profiles, specifically designed to scale up to the complexity of regulatory networks in mammalian cells, yet general enough to address a wider range of network deconvolution problems. This method uses an information theoretic approach to eliminate the majority of indirect interactions inferred by co-expression methods.",

        "Title": "Inactivation of the PRDM1/BLIMP1 gene in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.",
        "Abstract": "PR domain containing 1 with zinc finger domain (PRDM1)/B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1) is a transcriptional repressor expressed in a subset of germinal center (GC) B cells and in all plasma cells, and required for terminal B cell differentiation. The BLIMP1 locus lies on chromosome 6q21-q22.1, a region frequently deleted in B cell lymphomas, suggesting that it may harbor a tumor suppressor gene. We report here that the BLIMP1 gene is inactivated by structural alterations in 24% (8 out of 34) activated B cell-like diffuse large cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL), but not in GC B cell-like (n = 0/37) or unclassified (n = 0/21) DLBCL. BLIMP1 alterations included gene truncations, nonsense mutations, frameshift deletions, and splice site mutations that generate aberrant transcripts encoding truncated BLIMP1 proteins. In all cases studied, both BLIMP1 alleles were inactivated by deletions or mutations. Furthermore, most non-GC type DLBCL cases (n = 20/26, 77%) lack BLIMP1 protein expression, despite the presence of BLIMP1 mRNA. These results indicate that a sizable fraction of ABC-DLBCL carry an inactive BLIMP1 gene, and suggest that the same gene is inactivated by epigenetic mechanisms in an additional large number of cases. These findings point to a role for BLIMP1 as a tumor suppressor gene, whose inactivation may contribute to lymphomagenesis by blocking post-GC differentiation of B cells toward plasma cells.",

        "Abstract": "During humoral immune responses, two distinct genetic modification events diversify the Ig genes in germinal center (GC) B cells: somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination (CSR). Both processes require the activity of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), an enzyme expressed specifically in GC B cells. However, the mechanisms that regulate AID activity are largely unknown. Here we report that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates AID and regulates its activity in GC B cells. AID physically interacts with the PKA holoenzyme in the cytoplasm and is phosphorylated by the PKA catalytic subunit at specific residues. AID phosphorylation is required for CSR, because substitution of the two phosphorylation targets impairs its ability to rescue CSR in AID-deficient B cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of PKA prevents isotype class switching in a murine B-cell lymphoma cell line; conversely, B cells from mice where PKA activity is made constitutive by conditional deletion of the PKA regulatory subunit gene display enhanced CSR. These findings implicate PKA in the regulation of AID function and suggest that the control of T cell-dependent immune responses may be modulated, via AID, by signals that activate PKA.",

        "Abstract": "The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor that is required for germinal center formation and has been linked to lymphomagenesis. BCL6 functions by directly binding to specific DNA sequences and suppressing the transcription of target genes. Here we report an alternative mechanism by which BCL6 controls the transcription of genes lacking a BCL6 binding site and show that this mechanism was required for the prevention of tumor suppressor p53-independent cell cycle arrest in germinal center B cells. BCL6 interacted with the transcriptional activator Miz-1 and, via Miz-1, bound to the promoter and suppressed transcription of the cell cycle arrest gene CDKN1A. Through this mechanism, BCL6 may facilitate the proliferative expansion of germinal centers during the normal immune response and, when deregulated, the pathological expansion of B cell lymphomas.",

        "Abstract": "Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (MLBCL) shares important clinical and molecular features with classic Hodgkin lymphoma, including nuclear localization of the nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) subunit c-REL (reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog) in a pilot series. Herein, we analyzed c-REL subcellular localization in additional primary MLBCLs and characterized NFkappaB activity and function in a MLBCL cell line. The new primary MLBCLs had prominent c-REL nuclear staining, and the MLBCL cell line exhibited high levels of NFkappaB binding activity. MLBCL cells expressing a superrepressor form of inhibitor of kappa B alpha signaling (IkappaB alpha) had a markedly higher rate of apoptosis, implicating constitutive NFkappaB activity in MLBCL cell survival. The transcriptional profiles of newly diagnosed primary MLBCLs and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) were then used to characterize the NFkappaB target gene signatures of MLBCL and specific DLBCL subtypes. MLBCLs expressed increased levels of NFkappaB targets that promote cell survival and favor antiapoptotic tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) signaling. In contrast, activated B cell (ABC)-like DLBCLs had a more restricted, potentially developmentally regulated, NFkappaB target gene signature. Of interest, the newly characterized host response DLBCL subtype had a robust NFkappaB target gene signature that partially overlapped that of primary MLBCL. In this large series of primary MLBCLs and DLBCLs, NFkappaB activation was not associated with amplification of the cREL locus, suggesting alternative pathogenetic mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Cellular phenotypes are determined by the differential activity of networks linking coregulated genes. Available methods for the reverse engineering of such networks from genome-wide expression profiles have been successful only in the analysis of lower eukaryotes with simple genomes. Using a new method called ARACNe (algorithm for the reconstruction of accurate cellular networks), we report the reconstruction of regulatory networks from expression profiles of human B cells. The results are suggestive a hierarchical, scale-free network, where a few highly interconnected genes (hubs) account for most of the interactions. Validation of the network against available data led to the identification of MYC as a major hub, which controls a network comprising known target genes as well as new ones, which were biochemically validated. The newly identified MYC targets include some major hubs. This approach can be generally useful for the analysis of normal and pathologic networks in mammalian cells.",

        "Abstract": "Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also termed human herpesvirus type 8, is consistently identified in Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric Castleman's disease. Here we report four cases of KSHV-bearing solid lymphomas that occurred in AIDS patients (cases 1 to 3) and in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seronegative person (case 4). The patients presented extranodal masses in the abdomen (cases 1, 3, and 4) or skin (case 2), and nodal involvement, together with Kaposi's sarcoma (case 3). The gastrointestinal tract was involved in two patients (cases 1 and 3). The patients did not develop a lymphomatous effusion. KSHV was detected in the tumor cells of all cases by immunohistochemistry and by polymerase chain reaction. Epstein-Barr virus was detected in two of the HIV-related cases. All KSHV-positive solid lymphomas exhibited PEL-like cell morphology. To investigate the relationship of these disorders to PEL and to other AIDS-associated diffuse large cell lymphomas, KSHV-positive solid lymphomas were tested for the expression of a set of genes that were previously shown by gene profiling analysis to define PEL tumor cells. The results showed that expression of this set of genes in KSHV-positive lymphomas is similar to that of PEL but distinct from KSHV-negative AIDS-associated diffuse large cell lymphomas. Because pathobiological features of KSHV-positive solid lymphomas closely mimic those of PEL, our results suggest that KSHV-positive solid lymphomas should be considered as a tissue-based variant of classical PEL, irrespective of HIV status.",

        "Title": "The BCL6 proto-oncogene suppresses p53 expression in germinal-centre B cells.",
        "Abstract": "The human proto-oncogene BCL6 encodes a BTB/POZ-zinc-finger transcriptional repressor that is necessary for germinal-centre formation and is implicated in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoma. The precise function of BCL6 in germinal-centre development and lymphomagenesis is unclear because very few direct BCL6 target genes have been identified. Here we report that BCL6 suppresses the expression of the p53 (also known as tp53) tumour suppressor gene and modulates DNA damage-induced apoptotic responses in germinal-centre B cells. BCL6 represses p53 transcription by binding two specific DNA sites within the p53 promoter region and, accordingly, p53 expression is absent in germinal-centre B cells where BCL6 is highly expressed. Suppression of BCL6 expression via specific short interfering RNA leads to increased levels of p53 messenger RNA and protein both under basal conditions and in response to DNA damage. Most notably, constitutive expression of BCL6 protects B cell lines from apoptosis induced by DNA damage. These results suggest that an important function of BCL6 is to allow germinal-centre B cells to tolerate the physiological DNA breaks required for immunoglobulin class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation without inducing a p53-dependent apoptotic response. These findings also imply that deregulated BCL6 expression contributes to lymphomagenesis in part by functional inactivation of p53.",

        "Abstract": "Alloantigen specific CD8+CD28- T suppressor (TS) cells differ from naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ T-regulatory (natural TR) cells not only by their phenotype but also by their mechanism of action. Natural TR have been extensively studied, leading to the identification of characteristic \"molecular markers\" such as Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein (GITR) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4). We have investigated the expression of these genes in alloantigen specific TS and CD4+CD25+ T regulatory (TR) cells and found that they are expressed at levels similar to those observed in natural TR. Furthermore, similar to natural CD4+CD25+ TR, antigen-specific CD8+CD28-CD62L+ TS cells have more suppressive capacity than CD8+CD28-CD62L- TS cells. In spite of these similarities, natural TR are not antigen-specific and inhibit other T cells by T cell-to-T cell interaction, whereas TS are antigen-specific and exert their inhibitory function by interacting with antigen-presenting cells and render them tolerogenic to other T cells. The molecular characterization of TS cells may contribute to a better understanding of mechanisms involved in inhibition of immune responses in autoimmunity, transplantation, and chronic viral infection.",

        "Abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous disease with recognized variability in clinical outcome, genetic features, and cells of origin. To date, transcriptional profiling has been used to highlight similarities between DLBCL tumor cells and normal B-cell subtypes and associate genes and pathways with unfavorable outcome. To identify robust and highly reproducible DL-BCL subtypes with comprehensive transcriptional signatures, we used a large series of newly diagnosed DLBCLs, whole genome arrays, and multiple clustering methods. Tumors were also analyzed for known common genetic abnormalities in DLBCL. There were 3 discrete subsets of DLBCL-\"oxidative phosphorylation,\" \"B-cell receptor/proliferation,\" and \"host response\" (HR)-identified characterized using gene set enrichment analysis and confirmed in an independent series. HR tumors had increased expression of T/natural killer cell receptor and activation pathway components, complement cascade members, macrophage/dendritic cell markers, and inflammatory mediators. HR DLB-CLs also contained significantly higher numbers of morphologically distinct CD2+/CD3+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and interdigitating S100+/gamma interferon-induced lysosomal transferase-positive (GILT+) CD1a-/CD123- dendritic cells. The HR cluster shared features of histologically defined T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma, including fewer genetic abnormalities, younger age at presentation, and frequent splenic and bone marrow involvement. These studies identify tumor microenvironment and host inflammatory response as defining features in DLBCL and suggest rational treatment targets in specific DLBCL subsets.",

        "Abstract": "In the present study, we have investigated whether RNA can be efficiently isolated from Bouin-fixed or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymphoid tissue specimens. To this aim, we applied a new and simple method that includes the combination of proteinase K digestion and column purification. By this method, we demonstrated that the amplification of long fragments could be accomplished after a pre-heating step before cDNA synthesis associated with the use of enzymes that work at high temperature. By means of PCR using different primers for two examined genes (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH]- and CD40), we amplified segments of cDNA obtained by reverse transcription of the isolated RNA extracted from Bouin-fixed or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Amplified fragments of the expected sizes were obtained for both genes tested indicating that this method is suitable for the isolation of high-quality RNA. To explore the possibility for giving accurate real time quantitative RT-PCR results, cDNA obtained from matched frozen, Bouin-fixed and formalin-fixed neoplastic samples (two diffuse large cell lymphomas, one plasmacytoma) was tested for the following target genes: CD40, Aquaporin-3, BLIMP1, IRF4, Syndecan-1. Delta threshold cycle (DeltaC(T)) values for Bouin-fixed and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and their correlation with those for frozen samples showed an extremely high correlation (r > 0.90) for all of the tested genes. These results show that the method of RNA extraction we propose is suitable for giving accurate real time quantitative RT-PCR results.",

        "Abstract": "Substantial evidence indicates that signaling through the CD40 receptor (CD40) is required for germinal center (GC) and memory B-cell formation. However, it is not fully understood at which stages of B-cell development the CD40 pathway is activated in vivo. To address this question, we induced CD40 signaling in human transformed GC B cells in vitro and identified a CD40 gene expression signature by DNA microarray analysis. This signature was then investigated in the gene expression profiles of normal B cells and found in pre- and post-GC B cells (naive and memory) but, surprisingly, not in GC B cells. This finding was validated in lymphoid tissues by showing that the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factors, which translocate to the nucleus upon CD40 stimulation, are retained in the cytoplasm in most GC B cells, indicating the absence of CD40 signaling. Nevertheless, a subset of centrocytes and B cells in the subepithelium showed nuclear staining of multiple NF-kappaB subunits, suggesting that a fraction of naive and memory B cells may be subject to CD40 signaling or to other signals that activate NF-kappaB. Together, these results show that GC expansion occurs in the absence of CD40 signaling, which may act only in the initial and final stages of the GC reaction.",

        "Title": "Expression of the AID protein in normal and neoplastic B cells.",
        "Abstract": "Somatic hypermutation (SHM) targets primarily the immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) genes in germinal center (GC) B cells, thereby allowing antibody affinity maturation. A malfunction of SHM, termed aberrant somatic hypermutation (ASHM), was found in about 50% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), leading to mutations in the 5' sequences of multiple genes, including oncogenes. Although the SHM mechanism is largely unknown, it was shown to require the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene. AID mRNA is expressed in GC B cells and GC-derived lymphomas, but the pattern of expression of the AID protein is not known. Using 2 specific antibodies, here we show that the AID protein can be detected in GC centroblasts and their transformed counterpart (Burkitt lymphoma) but not in pre-GC B cells and post-GC neoplasms, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. DLBCLs displayed variable levels of AID expression, which did not correlate with IgV ongoing hypermutation, ASHM, or disease subtype. Finally, both in normal and malignant B cells the AID protein appeared predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that the AID protein is specifically expressed in normal and transformed GC B cells; nonetheless, its predominantly cytoplasmic localization suggests that additional mechanisms may regulate its function and may be altered during lymphomagenesis.",

        "Title": "Molecular pathogenesis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: the role of Bcl-6.",
        "Abstract": "Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) form a heterogeneous group of diseases, with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) comprising the largest subgroup. The commonest chromosomal translocations found in DLBCL are those affecting band 3q27. In 35% of DLBCL cases, as well as in a small fraction of follicular lymphomas, the normal transcriptional regulation of Bcl-6 is disrupted by these chromosomal translocations. In addition, about three-quarters of cases of DLBCL display multiple somatic mutations in the 5' non-coding region of Bcl-6, which occur independently of chromosomal translocations and appear to be due to the IgV-associated somatic hypermutation process. Bcl-6 is a 95-kD nuclear phosphoprotein belonging to the BTB/POZ (bric-a-brac, tramtrack, broad complex/Pox virus zinc finger) zinc finger family of transcription factors. It has been suggested that Bcl-6 is important in the repression of genes involved in the control of lymphocyte activation, differentiation, and apoptosis within the germinal center, and that its down-regulation is necessary for normal B-cells to exit the germinal center. Bcl-6 remains constitutively expressed in a substantial proportion of B-cell lymphomas. Recently, acetylation has been identified as a mode for down-regulating Bcl-6 activity by inhibition of the ability of Bcl-6 to recruit complexes containing histone deacetylases (HDAC). The pharmacologic inhibition of two recently identified deacetylation pathways, HDAC- and silent information regulator (SIR)-2-dependent deacetylation, results in the accumulation of inactive acetylated Bcl-6 and thus in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in B-cell lymphoma cells. These results reveal a new method of regulating Bcl-6, with the potential for therapeutic exploitation. These studies also indicate a novel mechanism by which acetylation promotes transcription, not only by modifying histones and activating transcriptional activators, but also by inhibiting transcriptional repressors.",

        "Abstract": "A marker capable of distinguishing with certainty between hairy cell leukaemia and other B-cell malignant disease would be of great diagnostic value. Through gene expression profiling, annexin A1 (ANXA1) has been identified as a gene that is upregulated in hairy cell leukaemia. We did immunostaining of 500 B-cell tumours with a specific anti-ANXA1 monoclonal antibody and showed that ANXA1 protein expression is specific to hairy cell leukaemia. Immunocytochemical detection of ANXA1 represents a simple, inexpensive, highly sensitive and specific (100%) assay for diagnosis of hairy cell leukaemia. This assay will be especially useful in distinguishing hairy cell leukaemia from splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes and variant hairy cell leukaemia, both of which usually respond poorly to treatments that are effective in hairy cell leukaemia.",

        "Abstract": "Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a chronic B cell malignancy characterized by the diffuse infiltration of bone marrow and spleen by cells displaying a typical \"hairy\" morphology. However, the nature of the HCL phenotype and its relationship to normal B cells and to other lymphoma subtypes remains unclear. Using gene expression profiling, we show here that HCL displays a homogeneous pattern of gene expression, which is clearly distinct from that of other B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Comparison with the gene expression profiles of purified normal B cell subpopulations, including germinal center (GC), pre-GC (naive), and post-GC (memory) B cells, shows that HCL cells are more related to memory cells, suggesting a derivation from this B cell population. Notably, when compared with memory cells, HCL cells displayed a remarkable conservation in proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA metabolism programs, whereas they appeared significantly altered in the expression of genes controlling cell adhesion and response to chemokines. Finally, these analyses have identified several genes that are specifically expressed in HCL and whose expression was confirmed at the protein level by immunocytochemical analysis of primary HCL cases. These results have biological implications relevant to the pathogenesis of this malignancy as well as clinical implications for its diagnosis and therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Although it has been suggested that REL is the critical target gene of 2p12-16 amplification in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), little experimental evidence supports this notion. In the present study, we sought to evaluate the relationship between REL amplification and REL function in a panel of 46 newly diagnosed DLBCLs and to correlate with DLBCL subgroups as identified by gene expression profiles and clinical features. The results indicate that amplification of the REL locus is not associated with accumulation of the active form of REL, as evaluated by immunofluorescence analysis. Upon subgrouping of the DLBCL cases based on gene expression signatures, REL amplification was detected in all subgroups, while high levels of nuclear-located REL were more frequently detected in activated B-cell-like DLBCL. Correlative analyses of REL copy number and REL nuclear accumulation with clinical parameters did not reveal any significant associations. Together these results indicate that 2p12-16 amplification does not lead to abnormal REL activation, suggesting that REL may not be the functional target of the amplification event. Nonetheless, these data indicate that DLBCLs are heterogeneous with respect to REL and thus nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity.",

        "Abstract": "Mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (MLBCL) is a recently identified subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that characteristically presents as localized tumors in young female patients. Although MLBCL has distinctive pathologic features, it clinically resembles the nodular sclerosis subtype of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). To elucidate the molecular features of MLBCL, we compared the gene expression profiles of newly diagnosed MLBCL and DLBCL and developed a classifier of these diseases. MLBCLs had low levels of expression of multiple components of the B-cell receptor signaling cascade, a profile resembling that of Reed-Sternberg cells of cHL. Like cHLs, MLBCLs also had high levels of expression of the interleukin-13 (IL-13) receptor and downstream effectors of IL-13 signaling (Janus kinase-2 [JAK2] and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 [STAT1]), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family members, and TNF receptor-associated factor-1 (TRAF1). Increased expression of STAT1 and TRAF1 in MLBCL was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Given the TRAF1 expression and known link to nuclear factor-kappa B (NF- kappa B), MLBCLs were also evaluated for nuclear translocation of c-REL protein. In almost all cases, c-REL was localized to the nucleus, consistent with activation of the NF-kappa B pathway. These studies identify a molecular link between MLBCL and cHL and a shared survival pathway.",

        "Abstract": "IRTA1 (immunoglobulin superfamily receptor translocation-associated 1) is a novel surface B-cell receptor related to Fc receptors, inhibitory receptor superfamily (IRS), and cell adhesion molecule (CAM) family members and we mapped for the first time its distribution in human lymphoid tissues, using newly generated specific antibodies. IRTA1 was selectively and consistently expressed by a B-cell population located underneath and within the tonsil epithelium and dome epithelium of Peyer patches (regarded as the anatomic equivalents of marginal zone). Similarly, in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas IRTA1 was mainly expressed by tumor cells involved in lympho-epithelial lesions. In contrast, no or a low number of IRTA1+ cells was usually observed in the marginal zone of mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen. Interestingly, monocytoid B cells in reactive lymph nodes were strongly IRTA1+. Tonsil IRTA1+ cells expressed the memory B-cell marker CD27 but not mantle cell-, germinal center-, and plasma cell-associated molecules. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of single tonsil IRTA1+ cells showed they represent a mixed B-cell population carrying mostly mutated, but also unmutated, IgV genes. The immunohistochemical finding in the tonsil epithelial areas of aggregates of IRTA1+ B cells closely adjacent to plasma cells surrounding small vessels suggests antigen-triggered in situ proliferation/differentiation of memory IRTA1+ cells into plasma cells. Collectively, these results suggest a role of IRTA1 in the immune function of B cells within epithelia.",

        "Abstract": "The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor required for the development of germinal centers (GCs) and implicated in the pathogenesis of GC-derived B cell lymphoma. Understanding the precise role of BCL6 in normal GC formation and in lymphomagenesis depends on the identification of genes that are direct targets of its transcriptional repression. Here we report that BCL6 directly controls the expression of B7-1/CD80, a costimulatory receptor involved in B-T cell interactions critical for the development of T cell-mediated antibody responses. Upon CD40 signaling, transcription of the CD80 gene is induced by the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB transcription factor. Our results show that BCL6 prevents CD40-induced expression of CD80 by binding its promoter region in vivo and suppressing its transcriptional activation by NF-kappaB. Consistent with a physiologic role for BCL6 in suppressing CD80, the expression of these two genes is mutually exclusive in B cells, and BCL6-defective mice show increased expression of CD80 in B cells. The results suggest that BCL6 may directly control the ability of B cell to interact with T cells during normal GC development. In addition, these findings imply that T-B cell interactions may be disrupted in B cell lymphoma expressing deregulated BCL6 genes.",

        "Abstract": "The MYC oncoprotein is a transcription factor that coordinates cell growth and division. MYC overexpression exacerbates genomic instability and sensitizes cells to apoptotic stimuli. Here we demonstrate that MYC directly stimulates transcription of the human Werner syndrome gene, WRN, which encodes a conserved RecQ helicase. Loss-of-function mutations in WRN lead to genomic instability, an elevated cancer risk, and premature cellular senescence. The overexpression of MYC in WRN syndrome fibroblasts or after WRN depletion from control fibroblasts led to rapid cellular senescence that could not be suppressed by hTERT expression. We propose that WRN up-regulation by MYC may promote MYC-driven tumorigenesis by preventing cellular senescence.",

        "Abstract": "The germinal center (GC) reaction in T cell dependent antibody responses is crucial for the generation of B cell memory and plays a critical role in B cell lymphomagenesis. To gain insight into the physiology of this reaction, we identified the transcriptional changes that occur in B cells during the GC-transit (na\u00efve B cells --> CD77(+) centroblasts (CBs) --> CD77(-) centrocytes (CCs) --> memory B cells) by DNA microarray experiments and the subsequent data analysis employing unsupervised and supervised hierarchical clustering. The na\u00efve B cell is characterized by a nonproliferative, anti-apoptotic phenotype and the expression of various chemokine and cytokine receptors. The transition from na\u00efve B cells to CBs is associated with (1) the up-regulation of genes associated with cellular proliferation, DNA-repair, and chromatin remodeling; (2) the acquisition of a pro-apoptotic phenotype; (3) the down-regulation of cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion receptors expressed in the na\u00efve cells; and (4) the expression of a distinct adhesion repertoire. The CB and the CC revealed surprisingly few gene expression differences, suggesting that the CC is heterogeneous in its cellular composition. The CB/CC to memory B cell transition shows a general reversion to the profile characteristic for the na\u00efve B cells, with the exception of the up-regulation of several surface receptors, including CD27, CD80, and IL-2Rbeta, and the simultaneous expression of both anti- and pro-apoptotic genes. These gene expression profiles of the normal B cell subpopulations are being used to identify the signals occurring during GC development, the cellular derivation of various types of B cell malignancies, and the genes deregulated in GC-derived tumors.",

        "Title": "Aberrant somatic hypermutation in multiple subtypes of AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",
        "Abstract": "The pathogenesis of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphomas (AIDS-NHLs) is associated with chromosomal translocations that deregulate the expression of various oncogenes. Recently, a novel mechanism of genetic lesion, termed aberrant hypermutation, has been identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of immunocompetent hosts. In these tumors, the somatic hypermutation (SHM) process that normally targets immunoglobulin V (IgV) genes in B cells appears to misfire and causes mutations in the 5' sequences of multiple proto-oncogenes, including PIM-1, PAX-5, RhoH/TTF, and c-MYC. To investigate whether aberrant hypermutation occurs also in AIDS-NHL, we studied the mutation profile of these 4 genes in various histologic subtypes. Mutations in 1 gene or more were detected in 19 of 39 (48.7%) AIDS-NHL cases (10 of 18 AIDS-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; 4 of 11 AIDS-Burkitt lymphoma; 4 of 6 AIDS-primary effusion lymphoma; 1 of 4 AIDS-primary central nervous system lymphoma), with 9 of 39 (23.1%) cases carrying mutations in 2 or more genes. Overall, PIM-1 was mutated in 5 of 39 (12.8%), PAX-5 in 8 of 39 (20.5%), RhoH/TTF in 9 of 39 (23.1%), and c-MYC in 7 of 27 (25.9%) AIDS-NHL cases. Mutations were represented mainly by single base pair substitutions (n = 63) with rare deletions/insertions (n = 5) and displayed features typical of the IgV-associated SHM process. In addition, a number of mutations in PIM-1 and c-MYC were found to affect coding exons, leading to amino acid substitutions with likely functional consequences. Analysis of intraclonal heterogeneity documented that the aberrant hypermutation activity may be ongoing in at least some cases. These data indicate that aberrant hypermutation is associated with various subtypes of AIDS-NHL and may represent a major contributor to their pathogenesis.",

Here we analyzed the transcriptional changes that occur in B cells during GC transit (naive B cells --> centroblasts --> centrocytes --> memory B cells) by gene expression profiling. Naive B cells, characterized by the expression of cell cycle-inhibitory and antiapoptotic genes, become centroblasts by inducing an atypical proliferation program lacking c-Myc expression, switching to a proapoptotic program, and down-regulating cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion receptors. The transition from GC to memory cells is characterized by a return to a phenotype similar to that of naive cells except for an apoptotic program primed for both death and survival and for changes in the expression of cell surface receptors including IL-2 receptor beta. These results provide insights into the dynamics of the GC reaction and represent the basis for the analysis of B cell malignancies.",

The malignant Hodgkin and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells derive from germinal center B cells (or rarely, T cells) but have a heterogeneous and largely uncharacterized phenotype. Using microarrays, we compared the gene expression profile of four HL cell lines with profiles of the main B cell subsets and B cell non-HLs to find out whether HRS cells, despite their described heterogeneity, show a distinct gene expression, to study their relationship to other normal and malignant B cells, and to identify genes aberrantly or overexpressed by HRS cells. The HL lines indeed clustered as a distinct entity, irrespective of their B or T cell derivation, and their gene expression was most similar to that of EBV-transformed B cells and cell lines derived from diffuse large cell lymphomas showing features of in vitro-activated B cells. Twenty-seven genes, most of which were previously unknown to be expressed by HRS cells, showed aberrant expression specifically in these cells, e.g., the transcription factors GATA-3, ABF1, EAR3, and Nrf3. For five genes, expression in primary HRS cells was confirmed. The newly identified HL-specific genes may play important roles in the pathogenesis of HL, potentially represent novel diagnostic markers, and can be considered for therapeutic targeting.",

        "Abstract": "AIDS-related primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an HIV-associated malignancy characterized by the ability of the tumor cells to specifically home in the serous body cavities. Here we used gene expression profile analysis (about 12 000 genes) to further define the phenotype of PEL and to investigate the lymphoma relationship to normal B cells and to other tumor subtypes, including non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) of immunocompetent hosts and AIDS-associated NHL (AIDS-NHL). The results showed that PEL displayed a common gene expression profile that is clearly distinct from all NHLs of immunocompetent hosts and AIDS-NHL subtypes and, in contrast to those, is not related to germinal center (GC) or memory B cells. The gene expression profile of PEL was defined as plasmablastic because it showed features of both immunoblasts identified by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and AIDS immunoblastic lymphoma, and plasma cells, as defined by multiple myeloma cell lines. Finally, our results identify a set of genes specifically expressed in PEL tumor cells. Their expression was validated at the protein level, suggesting their potential pathogenetic and clinical significance.",

        "Title": "CTCF functions as a critical regulator of cell-cycle arrest and death after ligation of the B cell receptor on immature B cells.",
        "Abstract": "The WEHI 231 B cell lymphoma is used as a model of self-tolerance by clonal deletion because B cell receptor (BCR) ligation results in apoptosis. Two critical events precede cell death: an early rise and fall in expression of MYC and cell-cycle arrest associated with enhanced expression of p21, p27, and p53. CTCF is a transcription factor identified as a repressor of MYC recently shown to cause cell growth inhibition. The present studies demonstrate that BCR ligation of WEHI 231 as well as of normal immature B cells greatly increased expression of CTCF in association with down-regulation of MYC followed by growth arrest and cell death. Conditional expression of CTCF in WEHI 231 mimicked BCR ligation with activated cells showing repressed expression of MYC, enhanced expression of p27, p21, p53, and p19(ARF), and inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis. In keeping with a central role for CTCF in control of B cell death, conditional expression of a CTCF antisense construct in WEHI 231 resulted in inhibition of p27, p21, p53, and p19(ARF) in association with enhanced expression of MYC. Activation of the endogenous CTCF locus by BCR ligation was also mimicked by three other routes to apoptotic death in WEHI 231: inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase or mTORFRAP signaling cascades and treatment with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Rapid activation of CTCF by BCR ligation or treatment with TGF-beta was suppressed by ligation of CD40. These results demonstrate that CTCF is a common determinant to different pathways of death signaling in immature B cells.",

        "Title": "Mutations of the BCL6 proto-oncogene disrupt its negative autoregulation in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.",
        "Abstract": "The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor whose expression is deregulated by chromosomal translocations in approximately 40% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). The BCL6 regulatory sequences are also targeted by somatic hypermutation in germinal center (GC) B cells and in a fraction of all GC-derived lymphomas. However, the functional consequences of these mutations are unknown. Here we report that a subset of mutations specifically associated with DLBCL causes deregulated BCL6 transcription. These mutations affect 2 adjacent BCL6 binding sites located within the first noncoding exon of the gene, and they prevent BCL6 from binding its own promoter, thereby disrupting its negative autoregulatory circuit. These alterations were found in approximately 16% of DLBCLs devoid of chromosomal translocations involving the BCL6 locus, but they were not found in normal GC B cells. This study establishes a novel mechanism for BCL6 deregulation and reveals a broader involvement of this gene in DLBCL pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "The c-MYC proto-oncogene encodes a ubiquitous transcription factor involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation and broadly implicated in tumorigenesis. Understanding the function of c-MYC and its role in cancer depends upon the identification of c-MYC target genes. Here we show that c-MYC induces the activity of Protein Kinase A (PKA), a key effector of cAMP-mediated signal transduction, by inducing the transcription of the gene encoding the PKA catalytic subunit beta (PKA-Cbeta). c-MYC-mediated induction of PKA-Cbeta gene transcription occurs in multiple tissues, is independent of cell proliferation and is mediated by direct binding of c-MYC to the PKA-Cbeta gene promoter sequences. Constitutive expression of PKA-Cbeta in Rat1A cells induces their transformation, and c-MYC-induced transformation can be reverted by pharmacological inhibition of PKA, suggesting that up-regulation of PKA is critical for c-MYC-associated tumorigenesis. These results indicate that, by activating PKA, c-MYC can provide endogenous activation of the cAMP signal transduction pathway independently of extracellular signals.",

        "Abstract": "The proto-oncogene BCL6 encodes a BTB/POZ-zinc finger transcriptional repressor that is necessary for germinal-center formation and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas. Here we show that the co-activator p300 binds and acetylates BCL6 in vivo and inhibits its function. Acetylation disrupts the ability of BCL6 to recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs), thereby hindering its capacity to repress transcription and to induce cell transformation. BCL6 is acetylated under physiologic conditions in normal germinal-center B cells and in germinal center-derived B-cell tumors. Treatment with specific inhibitors shows that levels of acetylation of BCL6 are controlled by both HDAC-dependent and SIR2-dependent pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of these pathways leads to the accumulation of the inactive acetylated BCL6 and to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in B-cell lymphoma cells. These results identify a new mechanism of regulation of the proto-oncogene BCL6 with potential for therapeutic exploitation. Furthermore, these findings provide a new mechanism by which acetylation can promote transcription not only by modifying histones and activating transcriptional activators, but also by inhibiting transcriptional repressors.",

        "Abstract": "Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells represent the malignant cells in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Because their immunophenotype cannot be attributed to any normal cell of the hematopoietic lineage, the origin of HRS cells has been controversially discussed, but molecular studies established their derivation from germinal center B cells. In this study, gene expression profiles generated by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and DNA chip microarrays from HL cell lines were compared with those of normal B-cell subsets, focusing here on the expression of B-lineage markers. This analysis revealed decreased mRNA levels for nearly all established B-lineage-specific genes. For 9 of these genes, lack of protein expression was histochemically confirmed. Down-regulation of genes affected multiple components of signaling pathways active in B cells, including B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Because several genes down-regulated in HRS cells are positively regulated by the transcriptional activator Pax-5, which is expressed in most HRS cells, we studied HL cell lines for mutations in the Pax-5 gene. However, no mutations were found. We propose that the lost B-lineage identity in HRS cells may explain their survival without BCR expression and reflect a fundamental defect in maintaining the B-cell differentiation state in HRS cells, which is likely caused by a novel, yet unknown, pathogenic mechanism.",

Multiple copies of BCL8A map to the 1-Mb proximal duplicated region at 15q. We identified additional copies on human chromosomes 13 (BCL8B), 22 (BCL8C), 2 (BCL8D), and 10 (BCL8E) by cDNA cloning and sequence analysis. BCL8A, BCL8C, BCL8D, and BCL8E are truncated at the genomic level and are presumably pseudogenes or sterile transcripts. BCL8B is expressed predominantly in human brain and encodes a 327-kDa protein with extensive homology to the Drosophila melanogaster protein kinase A anchoring protein RG. LRBA, a human gene with a ubiquitous expression pattern mapping to 4q32, encodes a protein closely related to BCL8. The phylogenetically conserved BCL8 gene family evolved by transchromosomal and intrachromosomal duplications within the human genome.",

        "Title": "Alternative translocation breakpoint cluster region 5' to BCL-6 in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.",
        "Abstract": "Chromosomal translocations involving band 3q27 with various different partner chromosomes represent a recurrent cytogenetic abnormality in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In a fraction of these translocations, the chromosomal breakpoint is located within the 5' noncoding region of the BCL-6 proto-oncogene where the BCL-6 major breakpoint region (MBR) maps. As a result of the translocation, BCL-6 expression is deregulated by promoter substitution. However, between 30 and 50% of lymphomas with cytogenetically detectable translocations affecting band 3q27 retain a germ-line configuration at the BCL-6 locus. To identify possible additional breakpoint clusters within 3q27, we cloned a t(3;14)(q27;q32) lymphoma without MBR rearrangement and found a novel breakpoint site located between 245 and 285 kb 5' to BCL-6. Breakpoints within this newly described region, which we called the alternative breakpoint region (ABR), were found to be recurrent in lymphomas carrying t(3q27) chromosomal translocations but devoid of BCL-6 MBR rearrangements. Comparative analysis of multiple lymphomas carrying rearrangements within the ABR showed that the breakpoints cluster within a 20-kb distance. Translocations involving the ABR may juxtapose BCL-6 to distantly acting, heterologous transcriptional regulatory elements which cause deregulation of the proto-oncogene. The identification of BCL-6 ABR provides new tools for the diagnosis of lymphomas carrying aberrations at 3q27 and deregulated BCL-6 genes.",

        "Abstract": "Knowledge of the role of cell-cycle regulators in the pathogenesis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (AIDS-NHLs) is scarce. Here we analyzed 86 systemic AIDS-NHLs and 20 AIDS-primary central nervous system lymphomas for expression of p27(Kip1), a negative regulator of cell-cycle progression belonging to the Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. In parallel, we investigated the relationship between p27(Kip1), the lymphoma proliferation index, Epstein-Barr virus status, expression of cellular cyclin D3 and cyclin D1, and B-cell differentiation stage. We report that AIDS-immunoblastic lymphomas (AIDS-IBLs), either systemic or primarily localized to the central nervous system, consistently express p27(Kip1) protein (19 of 24 and 10 of 14, respectively) despite the high proliferative rate of the lymphoma clone, suggesting a failure of p27(Kip1) to inhibit the cell cycle in AIDS-IBL. Conversely, the remaining systemic AIDS-NHLs and AIDS-primary central nervous system lymphomas preferentially fail to express p27(Kip1). Expression of p27(Kip1) in Epstein-Barr virus-positive AIDS-NHLs generally associates with latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) expression and is related to a late stage of B-cell differentiation, characterized by the BCL-6-/MUM1+/syn-1+/- phenotypic profile, whereas it seems to be unrelated to the expression of cellular cyclins. In B cells in vitro, induction of LMP-1 expression under the control of inducible promoters up-regulates expression of p27(Kip1), thus providing a putative mechanistic explanation for the association between LMP1 and p27(Kip1) observed in vivo. Overall, these data show that AIDS-IBL pathogenesis is characterized by loss of the inverse relationship between p27(Kip1) positivity and tumor growth fraction that is otherwise generally observed in normal lymphoid tissues and in most other types of NHLs.",

        "Title": "Expression pattern of MUM1/IRF4 in the spectrum of pathology of Hodgkin's disease.",
        "Abstract": "Biological and clinical studies have shown that Hodgkin's disease (HD) can be divided into two major categories, termed nodular lymphocyte predominance HD (NLP HD) and classic HD (CHD). Within CHD four subtypes have been distinguished: nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocyte rich and lymphocyte depletion. To refine the histogenesis of the pathological spectrum of HD, 75 CHD and 13 NLP HD were analysed for the expression pattern of MUM1/IRF4 (Multiple Myeloma-1/Interferon Regulatory Factor-4), a lymphocyte-specific member of the IRF family, that is expressed by late centrocytes and post-germinal centre (GC) B cells. MUM1 reacted with Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of all CHD cases (75/75 cases), with a moderate to strong staining intensity. Conversely, lymphocyte and histiocyte (L & H) cells, the putative tumour cells of NLP HD, were negative for MUM-1 expression (9/13 cases) or displayed a weak reactivity for the antigen in < 10% neoplastic cells (4/13 cases). With respect to HD microenvironment, NLP HD displayed numerous MUM1-positive T lymphocytes located in close proximity to L & H cells whereas, in CHD, MUM1-positive T lymphocytes appeared to be distributed randomly with no specific relationship with HRS cells. Overall, this study shows that MUM1 expression differs in L & H cells versus HRS cells, corroborating the notion that NLP HD and CHD represent different stages of B-cell differentiation. As MUM1-positive T lymphocytes form rosettes around tumour cells of NLP HD, but not of CHD, these data point also to differences in the microenvironment of NLP HD and CHD, and postulate an interactive role of MUM1-positive T lymphocytes with L & H cells.",

        "Abstract": "The IRTA1 and IRTA2 genes encode immunoglobulinlike cell surface receptors expressed in B cells and involved in chromosome 1q21 translocations in B-cell malignancy. We have now characterized and comparatively analyzed the structure and expression pattern of the entire family of IRTA genes, which includes 5 members contiguously located on chromosome 1q21. The IRTA messenger RNAs are expressed predominantly in the B-cell lineage within discrete B-cell compartments: IRTA1 is specific to the marginal zone, IRTA2 and IRTA3 are found in the germinal center light zone and in intraepithelial and interfollicular regions, and IRTA4 and IRTA5 are expressed predominantly in the mantle zone. All IRTA genes code for transmembrane receptors that are closely related to Fc receptors in their most amino-terminal extracellular domains and that possess cytoplasmic domains containing ITIM (immunotyrosine inhibition motifs)- and, possibly, ITAM (immunotyrosine activation motifs)-like motifs. These structural features suggest that the IRTA receptors may play a role in regulating activation of normal B cells and possibly in the development of neoplasia.",
