        "Title": "Integration of olfactory and auditory cues eliciting parental behavior.",
        "Abstract": "Parental care is crucial for the survival of all mammalian species. Given the evolutionary importance of parenting, this behavioral repertoire must be supported by circuitry that is innate but also capable of learning and flexibility - adjusting to changing environmental demands. In rodents, parental care is triggered by the perception of cues emitted by a pup. Caregiver-pup interactions are often composed of multimodal sensory stimuli that require caregivers to integrate across sensory modalities. In this review, we focus on two sensory modalities essential for the parental experience: smell and hearing. We examine how smell and hearing are combined with other senses to identify offspring in need of care. Understanding how multimodal stimuli are integrated in the caregiver brain to inform parental behavior is an important step in understanding the circuitry that underlies this complex and crucial behavioral repertoire. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in the field of rodent parental behavior, highlighting studies that have begun to disentangle the neural circuitry that processes the multisensory cues that are involved in caregiver-offspring interactions.",

        "Title": "Opposing, spatially-determined epigenetic forces impose restrictions on stochastic olfactory receptor choice.",
        "Abstract": "Olfactory receptor (OR) choice represents an example of genetically hardwired stochasticity, where every olfactory neuron expresses one out of ~2000 OR alleles in a probabilistic, yet stereotypic fashion. Here, we propose that topographic restrictions in OR expression are established in neuronal progenitors by two opposing forces: polygenic transcription and genomic silencing, both of which are influenced by dorsoventral gradients of transcription factors NFIA, B, and X. Polygenic transcription of OR genes may define spatially constrained OR repertoires, among which one OR allele is selected for singular expression later in development. Heterochromatin assembly and genomic compartmentalization of OR alleles also vary across the axes of the olfactory epithelium and may preferentially eliminate ectopically expressed ORs with more dorsal expression destinations from this \"privileged\" repertoire. Our experiments identify early transcription as a potential \"epigenetic\" contributor to future developmental patterning and reveal how two spatially responsive probabilistic processes may act in concert to establish deterministic, precise, and reproducible territories of stochastic gene expression.",

We predict a substantial acceleration of our understanding of the nervous system that will drive the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat diseases over the course of the next five decades. We also see neuroscience at the nexus of many societal topics beyond medicine, including education, consumerism, and the justice system. In combination, advances made by basic, translational, and clinical neuroscience research in the next 50 years have great potential for lasting improvements in human health, the economy, and society.",
