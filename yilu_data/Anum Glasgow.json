        "Abstract": "Quantitative tools to compile and analyze biomolecular interactions among chemically diverse binding partners would improve therapeutic design and aid in studying molecular evolution. Here we present Mapping Areas of Genetic Parsimony In Epitopes (MAGPIE), a publicly available software package for simultaneously visualizing and analyzing thousands of interactions between a single protein or small molecule ligand (the \"target\") and all of its protein binding partners (\"binders\"). MAGPIE generates an interactive three-dimensional visualization from a set of protein complex structures that share the target ligand, as well as sequence logo-style amino acid frequency graphs that show all the amino acids from the set of protein binders that interact with user-defined target ligand positions or chemical groups. MAGPIE highlights all the salt bridge and hydrogen bond interactions made by the target in the visualization and as separate amino acid frequency graphs. Finally, MAGPIE collates the most common target-binder interactions as a list of \"hotspots,\" which can be used to analyze trends or guide the de novo design of protein binders. As an example of the utility of the program, we used MAGPIE to probe how different antibody fragments bind a viral antigen; how a common metabolite binds diverse protein partners; and how two ligands bind orthologs of a well-conserved glycolytic enzyme for a detailed understanding of evolutionarily conserved interactions involved in its activation and inhibition. MAGPIE is implemented in Python 3 and freely available at https://github.com/glasgowlab/MAGPIE, along with sample datasets, usage examples, and helper scripts to prepare input structures.",

        "Abstract": "An important pathogenicity factor of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses is Non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1), which suppresses host gene expression and stunts antiviral signaling. SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binds the ribosome to inhibit translation through mRNA displacement and induces degradation of host mRNAs. Here we show that Nsp1-dependent host shutoff is conserved in diverse coronaviruses, but only Nsp1 from \u03b2-Coronaviruses (\u03b2-CoV) inhibits translation through ribosome binding. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of all \u03b2-CoV Nsp1s confers high-affinity ribosome binding despite low sequence conservation. Modeling of interactions of four Nsp1s with the ribosome identified the few absolutely conserved amino acids that, together with an overall conservation in surface charge, form the \u03b2-CoV Nsp1 ribosome-binding domain. Contrary to previous models, the Nsp1 ribosome-binding domain is an inefficient translation inhibitor. Instead, the Nsp1-CTD likely functions by recruiting Nsp1's N-terminal \"effector\" domain. Finally, we show that a cis-acting viral RNA element has co-evolved to fine-tune SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 function, but does not provide similar protection against Nsp1 from related viruses. Together, our work provides new insight into the diversity and conservation of ribosome-dependent host-shutoff functions of Nsp1, knowledge that could aid future efforts in pharmacological targeting of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 and related human-pathogenic \u03b2-CoVs. Our study also exemplifies how comparing highly divergent Nsp1 variants can help to dissect the different modalities of this multi-functional viral protein.",

        "Abstract": "Biological regulation ubiquitously depends on protein allostery, but the regulatory mechanisms are incompletely understood, especially in proteins that undergo ligand-induced allostery with few structural changes. Here we used hydrogen-deuterium exchange with mass spectrometry (HDX/MS) to map allosteric effects in a paradigm ligand-responsive transcription factor, the lac repressor (LacI), in different functional states (apo, or bound to inducer, anti-inducer, and/or DNA). Although X-ray crystal structures of the LacI core domain in these states are nearly indistinguishable, HDX/MS experiments reveal widespread differences in flexibility. We integrate these results with modeling of protein-ligand-solvent interactions to propose a revised model for allostery in LacI, where ligand binding allosterically shifts the conformational ensemble as a result of distinct changes in the rigidity of secondary structures in the different states. Our model provides a mechanistic basis for the altered function of distal mutations. More generally, our approach provides a platform for characterizing and engineering protein allostery.",

We recently engineered the\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 host entry receptor, ACE2, to tightly bind WT-RBD and prevent viral entry into host cells (\"receptor traps\"). Here we determine cryo-EM structures of our receptor traps in complex with stabilized Spike ectodomain. We develop a multi-model pipeline combining Rosetta protein modeling software and cryo-EM to allow interface energy calculations even at limited resolution and identify interface side chains that allow for high-affinity interactions between our ACE2 receptor traps and Spike-RBD. Our structural analysis provides a mechanistic rationale for the high-affinity (0.53-4.2\u00a0nM) binding of our ACE2 receptor traps to Omicron-RBD confirmed with biolayer interferometry measurements. Finally, we show that ACE2 receptor traps potently neutralize Omicron and Delta pseudotyped viruses, providing alternative therapeutic routes to combat this evolving virus.",

        "Title": "Engineered ACE2 receptor traps potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2.",
        "Abstract": "An essential mechanism for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection begins with the viral spike protein binding to the human receptor protein angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here, we describe a stepwise engineering approach to generate a set of affinity optimized, enzymatically inactivated ACE2 variants that potently block SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells. These optimized receptor traps tightly bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and prevent entry into host cells. We first computationally designed the ACE2-RBD interface using a two-stage flexible protein backbone design process that improved affinity for the RBD by up to 12-fold. These designed receptor variants were affinity matured an additional 14-fold by random mutagenesis and selection using yeast surface display. The highest-affinity variant contained seven amino acid changes and bound to the RBD 170-fold more tightly than wild-type ACE2. With the addition of the natural ACE2 collectrin domain and fusion to a human immunoglobulin crystallizable fragment (Fc) domain for increased stabilization and avidity, the most optimal ACE2 receptor traps neutralized SARS-CoV-2-pseudotyped lentivirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the 10- to 100-ng/mL range. Engineered ACE2 receptor traps offer a promising route to fighting infections by SARS-CoV-2 and other ACE2-using coronaviruses, with the key advantage that viral resistance would also likely impair viral entry. Moreover, such traps can be predesigned for viruses with known entry receptors for faster therapeutic response without the need for neutralizing antibodies isolated from convalescent patients.",

        "Abstract": "An essential mechanism for SARS-CoV-1 and -2 infection begins with the viral spike protein binding to the human receptor protein angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here we describe a stepwise engineering approach to generate a set of affinity optimized, enzymatically inactivated ACE2 variants that potently block SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells. These optimized receptor traps tightly bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and prevent entry into host cells. We first computationally designed the ACE2-RBD interface using a two-stage flexible protein backbone design process that improved affinity for the RBD by up to 12-fold. These designed receptor variants were affinity matured an additional 14-fold by random mutagenesis and selection using yeast surface display. The highest affinity variant contained seven amino acid changes and bound to the RBD 170-fold more tightly than wild-type ACE2. With the addition of the natural ACE2 collectrin domain and fusion to a human Fc domain for increased stabilization and avidity, the most optimal ACE2 receptor traps neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) in the 10-100 ng/ml range. Engineered ACE2 receptor traps offer a promising route to fighting infections by SARS-CoV-2 and other ACE2-utilizing coronaviruses, with the key advantage that viral resistance would also likely impair viral entry. Moreover, such traps can be predesigned for viruses with known entry receptors for faster therapeutic response without the need for neutralizing antibodies isolated or generated from convalescent patients.",

Here, we describe a generalizable computational strategy for designing sensor-actuator proteins by building binding sites de novo into heterodimeric protein-protein interfaces and coupling ligand sensing to modular actuation through split reporters. Using this approach, we designed protein sensors that respond to farnesyl pyrophosphate, a metabolic intermediate in the production of valuable compounds. The sensors are functional in vitro and in cells, and the crystal structure of the engineered binding site closely matches the design model. Our computational design strategy opens broad avenues to link biological outputs to new signals.",

However, it is challenging to precisely control the shape and chemical composition of submillimeter sized, cell-associated materials. In this protocol, we describe how to genetically modify and isolate a self-assembling filament protein from Salmonella enterica, PrgI, to bind Au nanoparticles. Au-conjugated filaments can be chemically reduced in vitro to form contiguous wires and networks that are several micrometers in length. We also describe a strategy to assemble PrgI-based filaments on live cells, which can then be sheared or remain tethered to cells for gold conjugation. These methods form the basis of a strategy for interactions between inorganic and organic systems, and could be expanded to introduce interactions with other metal nanoparticles for which peptide binding partners are known.",

        "Abstract": "The bacterial type III secretion system (T3SS) is an important target for enabling high-titer production of proteins of biotechnological interest as well as for synthetic biology applications that rely on protein delivery to host cells. The T3SS forms a membrane-embedded needle complex that is capped by the translocon proteins and extends into the extracellular space. The needle tip complex in Salmonella enterica consists of three translocon proteins: SipB, SipC, and SipD. It is known that knocking out sipD disrupts T3SS regulation to cause constitutive secretion of native proteins. However, we discovered that complementation of SipD in trans via exogenous addition to T3SS-expressing cultures further improves heterologous protein secretion titers, suggesting a previously unknown but important role for this protein. Building on this knowledge, we have engineered a hyper-secreting strain of S.\u00a0enterica for a greater than 100-fold improvement in the production of a variety of biotechnologically valuable heterologous proteins that are challenging to produce, such as toxic antimicrobial peptides and proteolysis-prone biopolymer proteins. We determined that transcription by several T3SS promoters is upregulated with the addition of SipD, that the N-terminal domain of SipD is sufficient to observe the increased secretion phenotype, and that the effect is post-transcriptional and post-translational. These results lend support to the use of bacterial secretion as a powerful protein production strategy, and the hypothesis that translocon proteins contribute to type III secretion regulation.",
