        "Abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) has become a popular method for determining high-resolution structures of biomolecules. However, data processing can be time-consuming, particularly for new researchers entering the field. To improve data quality and increase data collection efficiency, several software packages have been developed for on-the-fly data processing with various degrees of automation. These software packages allow researchers to perform tasks such as motion correction, CTF estimation, 2D classification, and 3D reconstruction in real-time, with minimal human input. On-the-fly data processing can not only improve data collection efficiency but also increase the productivity of instrumentation in high demand. However, the various software packages available differ in their performance, computational requirements, and levels of automation. In this review, we describe the minimal metrics used to assess data quality during data collection, outline the features of an ideal on-the-fly data processing software systems, and provide results from using three of these systems.",

        "Abstract": "Ice thickness is a critical parameter in single particle cryo-EM - too thin ice can break during imaging or exclude the sample of interest, while ice that is too thick contributes to more inelastic scattering that precludes obtaining high resolution reconstructions. Here we present the practical effects of ice thickness on resolution, and the influence of energy filters, accelerating voltage, or detector mode. We collected apoferritin data with a wide range of ice thicknesses on three microscopes with different instrumentation and settings. We show that on a 300\u00a0kV microscope, using a 20\u00a0eV energy filter slit has a greater effect on improving resolution in thicker ice; that operating at 300\u00a0kV instead of 200\u00a0kV accelerating voltage provides significant resolution improvements at an ice thickness above 150\u00a0nm; and that on a 200\u00a0kV microscope using a detector operating in super resolution mode enables good reconstructions for up to 200\u00a0nm ice thickness, while collecting in counting instead of linear mode leads to improvements in resolution for ice of 50-150\u00a0nm thickness. Our findings can serve as a guide for users seeking to optimize data collection or sample preparation routines for both single particle and in situ cryo-EM.\u00a0We note that most in situ data collection is done on samples in a range of ice thickness above 150\u00a0nm so these results may be especially relevant to that community.",

        "Title": "In situ cryo-FIB/SEM Specimen Preparation Using the Waffle Method.",
        "Abstract": "Cryo-focused ion beam (FIB) milling of vitrified specimens is emerging as a powerful method for in situ specimen preparation. It allows for the preservation of native and near-native conditions in cells, and can reveal the molecular structure of protein complexes when combined with cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and sub-tomogram averaging. Cryo-FIB milling is often performed on plunge-frozen specimens of limited thickness. However, this approach may have several disadvantages, including low throughput for cells that are small, or at low concentration, or poorly distributed across accessible areas of the grid, as well as for samples that may adopt a preferred orientation. Here, we present a detailed description of the \"Waffle Method\" protocol for vitrifying thick specimens followed by a semi-automated milling procedure using the Thermo Fisher Scientific (TFS) Aquilos 2 cryo-FIB/scanning electron microscope (SEM) instrument and AutoTEM Cryo software to produce cryo-lamellae. With this protocol, cryo-lamellae may be generated from specimens, such as microsporidia spores, yeast, bacteria, and mammalian cells, as well as purified proteins and protein complexes. An experienced lab can perform the entire protocol presented here within an 8-hour working day, resulting in two to three cryo-lamellae with target thicknesses of 100-200 nm and dimensions of approximately 12 \u03bcm width and 15-20 \u03bcm length. For cryo-FIB/SEMs with particularly low-contamination chambers, the protocol can be extended to overnight milling, resulting in up to 16 cryo-lamellae in 24 h. Graphical abstract.",

        "Title": "Fully automated multi-grid cryoEM screening using Smart Leginon.",
        "Abstract": "Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) is a swiftly growing method for understanding protein structure. With increasing demand for high-throughput, high-resolution cryoEM services comes greater demand for rapid and automated cryoEM grid and sample screening. During screening, optimal grids and sample conditions are identified for subsequent high-resolution data collection. Screening is a major bottleneck for new cryoEM projects because grids must be optimized for several factors, including grid type, grid hole size, sample concentration, buffer conditions, ice thickness and particle behavior. Even for mature projects, multiple grids are commonly screened to select a subset for high-resolution data collection. Here, machine learning and novel purpose-built image-processing and microscope-handling algorithms are incorporated into the automated data-collection software Leginon, to provide an open-source solution for fully automated high-throughput grid screening. This new version, broadly called Smart Leginon, emulates the actions of an operator in identifying areas on the grid to explore as potentially useful for data collection. Smart Leginon Autoscreen sequentially loads and examines grids from an automated specimen-exchange system to provide completely unattended grid screening across a set of grids. Comparisons between a multi-grid autoscreen session and conventional manual screening by 5 expert microscope operators are presented. On average, Autoscreen reduces operator time from \u223c6\u2005h to <10\u2005min and provides a percentage of suitable images for evaluation comparable to the best operator. The ability of Smart Leginon to target holes that are particularly difficult to identify is analyzed. Finally, the utility of Smart Leginon is illustrated with three real-world multi-grid user screening/collection sessions, demonstrating the efficiency and flexibility of the software package. The fully automated functionality of Smart Leginon significantly reduces the burden on operator screening time, improves the throughput of screening and recovers idle microscope time, thereby improving availability of cryoEM services.",

        "Title": "Waffle Method: A general and flexible approach for improving throughput in FIB-milling.",
        "Abstract": "Cryo-FIB/SEM combined with cryo-ET has emerged from within the field of cryo-EM as the method for obtaining the highest resolution structural information of complex biological samples in-situ in native and non-native environments. However, challenges remain in conventional cryo-FIB/SEM workflows, including milling thick specimens with vitrification issues, specimens with preferred orientation, low-throughput when milling small and/or low concentration specimens, and specimens that distribute poorly across grid squares. Here we present a general approach called the 'Waffle Method' which leverages high-pressure freezing to address these challenges. We illustrate the mitigation of these challenges by applying the Waffle Method and cryo-ET to reveal the macrostructure of the polar tube in microsporidian spores in multiple complementary orientations, which was previously not possible due to preferred orientation. We demonstrate the broadness of the Waffle Method by applying it to three additional cellular samples and a single particle sample using a variety of cryo-FIB-milling hardware, with manual and automated approaches. We also present a unique and critical stress-relief gap designed specifically for waffled lamellae. We propose the Waffle Method as a way to achieve many advantages of cryo-liftout on the specimen grid while avoiding the long, challenging, and technically-demanding process required for cryo-liftout.",

        "Abstract": "Presequence protease (PreP), a 117\u2009kDa mitochondrial M16C metalloprotease vital for mitochondrial proteostasis, degrades presequence peptides cleaved off from nuclear-encoded proteins and other aggregation-prone peptides, such as amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2). PreP structures have only been determined in a closed conformation; thus, the mechanisms of substrate binding and selectivity remain elusive. Here, we leverage advanced vitrification techniques to overcome the preferential denaturation of one of two ~55\u2009kDa homologous domains of PreP caused by air-water interface adsorption. Thereby, we elucidate cryoEM structures of three apo-PreP open states along with A\u03b2- and citrate synthase presequence-bound PreP at 3.3-4.6\u2009\u00c5 resolution. Together with integrative biophysical and pharmacological approaches, these structures reveal the key stages of the PreP catalytic cycle and how the binding of substrates or PreP inhibitor drives a rigid body motion of the protein for substrate binding and catalysis. Together, our studies provide key mechanistic insights into M16C metalloproteases for future therapeutic innovations.",

        "Abstract": "Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) uses images of frozen hydrated biological specimens to produce macromolecular structures, opening up previously inaccessible levels of biological organization to high-resolution structural analysis. CryoEM has the potential for broad impact in biomedical research, including basic cell, molecular, and structural biology, and increasingly in drug discovery and vaccine development. Recent advances have led to the expansion of molecular and cellular structure determination at an exponential rate. National and regional centers have emerged to support this growth by increasing the accessibility of cryoEM throughout the biomedical research community. Through cooperation and synergy, these centers form a network of resources that accelerate the adoption of best practices for access and training and establish sustainable workflows to build future research capacity.",

        "Abstract": "The emerging field of microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) is of great interest to industrial researchers working in the drug discovery and drug development space. The promise of being able to routinely solve high-resolution crystal structures without the need to grow large crystals is very appealing. Despite MicroED's exciting potential, adoption across the pharmaceutical industry has been slow, primarily owing to a lack of access to specialized equipment and expertise. Here we present our experience building a small molecule MicroED service pipeline for members of the pharmaceutical industry. In the past year, we have examined more than fifty small molecule samples submitted by our clients, the majority of which have yielded data suitable for structure solution. We also detail our experience determining small molecule MicroED structures of pharmaceutical interest and offer some insights into the typical experimental outcomes. This experience has led us to conclude that small molecule MicroED adoption will continue to grow within the pharmaceutical industry where it is able to rapidly provide structures inaccessible by other methods.",

        "Abstract": "The capture of short-lived molecular states triggered by the early encounter of two or more interacting particles continues to be an experimental challenge of great interest to the field of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). A few methodological strategies have been developed that support these \"time-resolved\" studies, one of which, Spotiton-a novel robotic system-combines the dispensing of picoliter-sized sample droplets with precise temporal and spatial control. The time-resolved Spotiton workflow offers a uniquely efficient approach to interrogate early structural rearrangements from minimal sample volume. Fired from independently controlled piezoelectric dispensers, two samples land and rapidly mix on a nanowire EM grid as it plunges toward the cryogen. Potentially hundreds of grids can be prepared in rapid succession from only a few microliters of a sample. Here, a detailed step-by-step protocol of the operation of the Spotiton system is presented with a focus on troubleshooting specific problems that arise during grid preparation.",

        "Title": "Assembly of Building Blocks by Double-End-Anchored Polymers in the Dilute Regime Mediated by Hydrophobic Interactions at Controlled Distances.",
        "Abstract": "Hierarchical assembly of building blocks via competing, orthogonal interactions is a hallmark of many of nature's composite materials that do not require highly specific ligand-receptor interactions. To mimic this assembly mechanism requires the development of building blocks capable of tunable interactions. In the present work, we explored the interplay between repulsive (steric and electrostatic) and attractive hydrophobic forces. The designed building blocks allow hydrophobic forces to effectively act at controlled, large distances, to create and tune the assembly of membrane-based building blocks under dilute conditions, and to affect their interactions with cellular membranes via physical cross-bridges. Specifically, we employed double-end-anchored poly(ethylene glycol)s (DEA-PEGs)-hydrophilic PEG tethers with hydrophobic tails on both ends. Using differential-interference-contrast optical microscopy, synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and cryogenic electron microscopy, we investigated the ability of DEA-PEGs to mediate assembly in the dilute regime on multiple length scales and on practical time scales. The PEG length, anchor hydrophobicity, and molar fraction of DEA-PEG molecules within a membrane strongly affect the assembly properties. Additional tuning of the intermembrane interactions can be achieved by adding repulsive interactions via PEG-lipids (steric) or cationic lipids to the DEA-PEG-mediated attractions. While the optical and electron microscopy imaging methods provided qualitative evidence of the ability of DEA-PEGs to assemble liposomes, the SAXS measurements and quantitative line-shape analysis in dilute preparations demonstrated that the ensemble average of loosely organized liposomal assemblies maintains DEA-PEG concentration-dependent tethering on defined nanometer length scales. For cationic liposome-DNA nanoparticles (CL-DNA NPs), aggregation induced by DEA-PEGs decreased internalization of NPs by cells, but tuning the DEA-PEG-induced attractions by adding repulsive steric interactions via PEG-lipids limited aggregation and increased NP uptake. Furthermore, confocal microscopy imaging together with colocalization studies with Rab11 and LysoTracker as markers of intracellular pathways showed that modifying CL-DNA NPs with DEA-PEGs alters their interactions with the plasma and endosomal membranes.",

        "Abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes tuberculosis, a disease that kills over 1 million people each year. Its cell envelope is a common antibiotic target and has a unique structure due, in part, to two lipidated polysaccharides-arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan. Arabinofuranosyltransferase D (AftD) is an essential enzyme involved in assembling these glycolipids. We present the 2.9-\u00c5 resolution structure of M.\u00a0abscessus AftD, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. AftD has a conserved GT-C glycosyltransferase fold and three carbohydrate-binding modules. Glycan array analysis shows that AftD binds complex arabinose glycans. Additionally, AftD is non-covalently complexed with an acyl carrier protein (ACP). 3.4- and 3.5-\u00c5 structures of a mutant with impaired ACP binding reveal a conformational change, suggesting that ACP may regulate AftD function. Mutagenesis experiments using a conditional knockout constructed in M.\u00a0smegmatis confirm the essentiality of the putative active site and the ACP binding for AftD function.",

        "Abstract": "Non-clustered \u03b41- and \u03b42-protocadherins, close relatives of clustered protocadherins, function in cell adhesion and motility and play essential roles in neural patterning. To understand the molecular interactions underlying these functions, we used solution biophysics to characterize binding of \u03b41- and \u03b42-protocadherins, determined crystal structures of ectodomain complexes from each family, and assessed ectodomain assembly in reconstituted intermembrane junctions by cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET). Homophilic trans (cell-cell) interactions were preferred for all \u03b4-protocadherins, with additional weaker heterophilic interactions observed exclusively within each subfamily. As expected, \u03b41- and \u03b42-protocadherin trans dimers formed through antiparallel EC1-EC4 interfaces, like clustered protocadherins. However, no ectodomain-mediated cis (same-cell) interactions were detectable in solution; consistent with this, cryo-ET of reconstituted junctions revealed dense assemblies lacking the characteristic order observed for clustered protocadherins. Our results define non-clustered protocadherin binding properties and their structural basis, providing a foundation for interpreting their functional roles in neural patterning.",

However, NP PEGylation typically obstructs cell attachment and uptake in vitro compared to the uncoated equivalent.

        "Abstract": "The vaccine-mediated elicitation of antibodies (Abs) capable of neutralizing diverse HIV-1 strains has been a long-standing goal. To understand how broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) can be elicited, we identified, characterized, and tracked five neutralizing Ab lineages targeting the HIV-1-fusion peptide (FP) in vaccinated macaques over time. Genetic and structural analyses revealed two of these lineages to belong to a reproducible class capable of neutralizing up to 59% of 208 diverse viral strains. B cell analysis indicated each of the five lineages to\u00a0have been initiated and expanded by FP-carrier priming, with envelope (Env)-trimer boosts inducing cross-reactive neutralization. These Abs had binding-energy hotspots focused on FP, whereas several FP-directed Abs induced by immunization with Env trimer-only were less FP-focused and less broadly neutralizing. Priming with a conserved subregion, such as FP, can thus induce Abs with binding-energy hotspots coincident with the target subregion and capable of broad neutralization.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in instrumentation and software for cryoEM have increased the applicability and utility of this method. High levels of automation and faster data acquisition rates require hard decisions to be made regarding data retention. Here we investigate the efficacy of data compression applied to aligned summed movie files. Surprisingly, these images can be compressed using a standard lossy method that reduces file storage by 90-95% and yet can still be processed to provide sub-2\u202f\u00c5 reconstructed maps. We do not advocate this as an archival method, but it may provide a useful means for retaining images as an historical record, especially at large facilities.",

        "Abstract": "As self-assembling polyvalent nanoscale structures that can tolerate substantial genetic and chemical modification, virus-like particles are useful in a variety of fields. Here we describe the genetic modification and structural characterization of the Leviviridae PP7 capsid protein as a platform for the presentation of functional polypeptides. This particle was shown to tolerate the display of sequences from 1 kDa (a cell penetrating peptide) to 14 kDa (the Fc-binding double Z-domain) on its exterior surface as C-terminal genetic fusions to the coat protein. In addition, a dimeric construct allowed the presentation of exogenous loops between capsid monomers and the simultaneous presentation of two different peptides at different positions on the icosahedral structure. The PP7 particle is thereby significantly more tolerant of these types of polypeptide additions than Q\u03b2 and MS2, the other Leviviridae-derived VLPs in common use.",

        "Abstract": "Parainfluenza virus types 1-4 (PIV1-4) are highly infectious human pathogens, of which PIV3 is most commonly responsible for severe respiratory illness in newborns, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. To obtain a vaccine effective against all four PIV types, we engineered mutations in each of the four PIV fusion (F) glycoproteins to stabilize their metastable prefusion states, as such stabilization had previously enabled the elicitation of high-titer neutralizing antibodies against the related respiratory syncytial virus. A cryoelectron microscopy structure of an engineered PIV3 F prefusion-stabilized trimer, bound to the prefusion-specific antibody PIA174, revealed atomic-level details for how introduced mutations improved stability as well as how a single PIA174 antibody recognized the trimeric apex of prefusion PIV3 F. Nine combinations of six newly identified disulfides and two cavity-filling mutations stabilized the prefusion PIV3 F immunogens and induced 200- to 500-fold higher neutralizing titers in mice than were elicited by PIV3 F in the postfusion conformation. For PIV1, PIV2, and PIV4, we also obtained stabilized prefusion Fs, for which prefusion versus postfusion titers were 2- to 20-fold higher. Elicited murine responses were PIV type-specific, with little cross-neutralization of other PIVs. In nonhuman primates (NHPs), quadrivalent immunization with prefusion-stabilized Fs from PIV1-4 consistently induced potent neutralizing responses against all four PIVs. For PIV3, the average elicited NHP titer from the quadrivalent immunization was more than fivefold higher than any titer observed in a cohort of over 100 human adults, highlighting the ability of a prefusion-stabilized immunogen to elicit especially potent neutralization.",

By using a rapid plunge-freezing robot and nanowire grids, we were able to reduce some of the deleterious effects of the air-water interface by decreasing the dwell time of particles in thin liquid films. We demonstrated this by using single-particle cryo-EM and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to examine hemagglutinin, insulin receptor complex, and apoferritin.",

        "Abstract": "The tip link, a filament formed by protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and cadherin 23, conveys mechanical force from sound waves and head movement to\u00a0open hair-cell mechanotransduction channels. Tip-link cadherins are thought to have acquired structural features critical for their role in mechanotransduction. Here, we biophysically and structurally characterize the unusual cis-homodimeric architecture of PCDH15. We show that PCDH15 molecules form double-helical assemblies through cis-dimerization interfaces in the extracellular cadherin EC2-EC3 domain region and in a unique membrane-proximal domain. Electron microscopy studies visualize the cis-dimeric PCDH15 assembly and reveal the PCDH15 extracellular domain as a parallel double helix with cis cross-bridges at the two locations we defined. The\u00a0helical configuration suggests the potential for\u00a0elasticity through helix winding and unwinding. Functional studies in hair cells show that mutations that perturb PCDH15 dimerization contacts affect mechanotransduction. Together, these data reveal the cis-dimeric architecture of PCDH15 and show that dimerization is critical for sensing mechanical stimuli.",

        "Title": "High resolution single particle cryo-electron microscopy using beam-image shift.",
        "Abstract": "Automated data acquisition is used widely for single-particle reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) volumes of biological complexes preserved in vitreous ice and imaged in a transmission electron microscope. Automation has become integral to this method because of the very large number of particle images required in order to overcome the typically low signal-to-noise ratio of these images. For optimal efficiency, automated data acquisition software packages typically employ some beam-image shift targeting as this method is both fast and accurate (\u00b10.1\u202f\u00b5m). In contrast, using only stage movement, relocation to a targeted area under low-dose conditions can only be achieved in combination with multiple iterations or long relaxation times, both reducing efficiency. Nevertheless it is well known that applying beam-image shift induces beam-tilt and with it a potential structure phase error with a phase error \u03c0/4 the highest acceptable value. This theory has been used as an argument against beam-image shift for high resolution data collection. Nevertheless, in practice many small beam-image shift datasets have resulted in 3D reconstructions beyond the \u03c0/4 phase error limit. To address this apparent contradiction, we performed cryo-EM single-particle reconstructions on a T20S proteasome sample using applied beam-image shifts corresponding to beam tilts from 0 to 10 mrad. To evaluate the results we compared the FSC values, and examined the water density peaks in the 3D map. We conclude that the phase error does not limit the validity of the 3D reconstruction from single-particle averaging beyond the \u03c0/4 resolution limit.",

Sample preparation is still a limiting factor in collecting high quality data. Thickness of the vitreous ice in which the particles are embedded is one of the many variables that need to be optimized for collection of the highest quality data. Here we present two methods, using either an energy filter or scattering outside the objective aperture, to measure ice thickness for potentially every image collected. Unlike geometrical or tomographic methods, these can be implemented directly in the single particle collection workflow without interrupting or significantly slowing down data collection. We describe the methods as implemented into the Leginon/Appion data collection workflow, along with some examples from test cases. Routine monitoring of ice thickness should prove helpful for optimizing sample preparation, data collection, and data processing.",

        "Abstract": "Eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) targeting envelope (Env) is a major goal of HIV vaccine development, but cross-clade breadth from immunization has only sporadically been observed. Recently, Xu et al (2018) elicited cross-reactive neutralizing antibody responses in a variety of animal models using immunogens based on the epitope of bnAb VRC34.01. The VRC34.01 antibody, which was elicited by natural human infection, targets the N terminus of the Env fusion peptide, a critical component of the virus entry machinery. Here we precisely characterize the functional epitopes of VRC34.01 and two vaccine-elicited murine antibodies by mapping all single amino-acid mutations to the BG505 Env that affect viral neutralization. While escape from VRC34.01 occurred via mutations in both fusion peptide and distal interacting sites of the Env trimer, escape from the vaccine-elicited antibodies was mediated predominantly by mutations in the fusion peptide. Cryo-electron microscopy of four vaccine-elicited antibodies in complex with Env trimer revealed focused recognition of the fusion peptide and provided a structural basis for development of neutralization breadth. Together, these functional and structural data suggest that the breadth of vaccine-elicited antibodies targeting the fusion peptide can be enhanced by specific interactions with additional portions of Env. Thus, our complete maps of viral escape both delineate pathways of resistance to these fusion peptide-directed antibodies and provide a strategy to improve the breadth or potency of future vaccine-induced antibodies against Env's fusion peptide.",

        "Abstract": "Cryo electron microscopy facilities running multiple instruments and serving users with varying skill levels need a robust and reliable method for benchmarking both the hardware and software components of their single particle analysis workflow. The workflow is complex, with many bottlenecks existing at the specimen preparation, data collection and image analysis steps; the samples and grid preparation can be of unpredictable quality, there are many different protocols for microscope and camera settings, and there is a myriad of software programs for analysis that can depend on dozens of settings chosen by the user. For this reason, we believe it is important to benchmark the entire workflow, using a standard sample and standard operating procedures, on a regular basis. This provides confidence that all aspects of the pipeline are capable of producing maps to high resolution. Here we describe benchmarking procedures using a test sample, rabbit muscle aldolase.",

Here we show that focusing the immune response to exposed N-terminal residues of the fusion peptide, a critical component of the viral entry machinery and the epitope of antibodies elicited by HIV-1 infection, through immunization with fusion peptide-coupled carriers and prefusion stabilized envelope trimers, induces cross-clade neutralizing responses. In mice, these immunogens elicited monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing up to 31% of a cross-clade panel of 208 HIV-1 strains. Crystal and cryoelectron microscopy structures of these antibodies revealed fusion peptide conformational diversity as a molecular explanation for the cross-clade neutralization. Immunization of guinea pigs and rhesus macaques induced similarly broad fusion peptide-directed neutralizing responses, suggesting translatability. The N terminus of the HIV-1 fusion peptide is thus a promising target of vaccine efforts aimed at eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies.",

        "Abstract": "Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) is often performed under the assumption that particles are not adsorbed to the air-water interfaces and in thin, vitreous ice. In this study, we performed fiducial-less tomography on over 50 different cryoEM grid/sample preparations to determine the particle distribution within the ice and the overall geometry of the ice in grid holes. Surprisingly, by studying particles in holes in 3D from over 1000 tomograms, we have determined that the vast majority of particles (approximately 90%) are adsorbed to an air-water interface. The implications of this observation are wide-ranging, with potential ramifications regarding protein denaturation, conformational change, and preferred orientation. We also show that fiducial-less cryo-electron tomography on single particle grids may be used to determine ice thickness, optimal single particle collection areas and strategies, particle heterogeneity, and de novo models for template picking and single particle alignment.",

        "Abstract": "Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) plays key roles in degrading peptides vital in type two diabetes, Alzheimer's, inflammation, and other human diseases. However, the process through which IDE recognizes peptides that tend to form amyloid fibrils remained unsolved. We used cryoEM to understand both the apo- and insulin-bound dimeric IDE states, revealing that IDE displays a large opening between the homologous ~55 kDa N- and C-terminal halves to allow selective substrate capture based on size and charge complementarity. We also used cryoEM, X-ray crystallography, SAXS, and HDX-MS to elucidate the molecular basis of how amyloidogenic peptides stabilize the disordered IDE catalytic cleft, thereby inducing selective degradation by substrate-assisted catalysis. Furthermore, our insulin-bound IDE structures explain how IDE processively degrades insulin by stochastically cutting either chain without breaking disulfide bonds. Together, our studies provide a mechanism for how IDE selectively degrades amyloidogenic peptides and offers structural insights for developing IDE-based therapies.",

        "Title": "Structure of the insulin receptor-insulin complex by single-particle cryo-EM analysis.",
        "Abstract": "The insulin receptor is a dimeric protein that has a crucial role in controlling glucose homeostasis, regulating lipid, protein and carbohydrate metabolism, and modulating brain neurotransmitter levels. Insulin receptor dysfunction has been associated with many diseases, including diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. The primary sequence of the receptor has been known since the 1980s, and is composed of an extracellular portion (the ectodomain, ECD), a single transmembrane helix and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Binding of insulin to the dimeric ECD triggers auto-phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domain and subsequent activation of downstream signalling molecules. Biochemical and mutagenesis data have identified two putative insulin-binding sites, S1 and S2. The structures of insulin bound to an ECD fragment containing S1 and of the apo ectodomain have previously been reported, but details of insulin binding to the full receptor and the signal propagation mechanism are still not understood. Here we report single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of the 1:2 (4.3\u2009\u00c5) and 1:1 (7.4\u2009\u00c5) complexes of the insulin receptor ECD dimer with insulin. The symmetrical 4.3\u2009\u00c5 structure shows two insulin molecules per dimer, each bound between the leucine-rich subdomain L1 of one monomer and the first fibronectin-like domain (FnIII-1) of the other monomer, and making extensive interactions with the \u03b1-subunit C-terminal helix (\u03b1-CT helix). The 7.4\u2009\u00c5 structure has only one similarly bound insulin per receptor dimer. The structures confirm the binding interactions at S1 and define the full S2 binding site. These insulin receptor states suggest that recruitment of the \u03b1-CT helix upon binding of the first insulin changes the relative subdomain orientations and triggers downstream signal propagation.",

Nanowires are grown on the copper surface of the grid using a simple chemical reaction and the opposite smooth side is used to adhere to a holey sample substrate support, for example carbon or gold. When small volumes of sample are applied to the nanowire grids the wires effectively act as blotting paper to rapidly wick away the liquid, leaving behind a thin film. In this technical note, we present a detailed description of how we make these grids using a variety of substrates fenestrated with either lacey or regularly spaced holes. We explain how we characterize the quality of the grids and we describe their behavior under a variety of conditions.",

We also describe a tool to quantify the resulting directional resolution using 3D Fourier shell correlation volumes.

        "Abstract": "Binding of the gp120 envelope (Env) glycoprotein to the CD4 receptor is the first step in the HIV-1 infectious cycle. Although the CD4-binding site has been extensively characterized, the initial receptor interaction has been difficult to study because of major CD4-induced structural rearrangements. Here we used cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize the initial contact of CD4 with the HIV-1 Env trimer at 6.8-\u00c5 resolution. A single CD4 molecule is embraced by a quaternary HIV-1-Env surface formed by coalescence of the previously defined CD4-contact region with a second CD4-binding site (CD4-BS2) in the inner domain of a neighboring gp120 protomer. Disruption of CD4-BS2 destabilized CD4-trimer interaction and abrogated HIV-1 infectivity by preventing the acquisition of coreceptor-binding competence. A corresponding reduction in HIV-1 infectivity occurred after the mutation of CD4 residues that interact with CD4-BS2. Our results document the critical role of quaternary interactions in the initial HIV-Env-receptor contact, with implications for treatment and vaccine design.",

        "Abstract": "The ribosome is a complex macromolecular machine and serves as an ideal system for understanding biological macromolecular assembly. Direct observation of ribosome assembly in\u00a0vivo is difficult, as few intermediates have been isolated and thoroughly characterized. Herein, we deploy a genetic system to starve cells of an essential ribosomal protein, which results in the accumulation of assembly intermediates that are competent for maturation. Quantitative mass spectrometry and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reveal 13 distinct intermediates, which were each resolved to \u223c4-5\u00a0\u00c5 resolution and could be placed in an assembly pathway. We find that ribosome biogenesis is a parallel process, that blocks of structured rRNA and proteins assemble cooperatively, and that the entire process is dynamic and can be \"re-routed\" through different pathways as needed. This work reveals the complex landscape of ribosome assembly in\u00a0vivo and provides the requisite tools to characterize additional assembly pathways for ribosomes and other macromolecular machines.",

        "Abstract": "Almost every aspect of cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) has been automated over the last few decades. One of the challenges that remains to be addressed is the robust and reliable preparation of vitrified specimens of suitable ice thickness. We present results from a new device for preparing vitrified samples. The successful use of the device is coupled to a new \"self-blotting\" grid that we have developed to provide a method for spreading a sample to a thin film without the use of externally applied filter paper. This new approach has the advantage of using small amounts of protein material, resulting in large areas of ice of a well defined thickness containing evenly distributed single particles. We believe that these methods will in the future result in a system for vitrifying grids that is completely automated.",

        "Abstract": "Class B G protein-coupled receptors are composed of an extracellular domain (ECD) and a seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain, and their signalling is regulated by peptide hormones. Using a hybrid structural biology approach together with the ECD and 7TM domain crystal structures of the glucagon receptor (GCGR), we examine the relationship between full-length receptor conformation and peptide ligand binding. Molecular dynamics (MD) and disulfide crosslinking studies suggest that apo-GCGR can adopt both an open and closed conformation associated with extensive contacts between the ECD and 7TM domain. The electron microscopy (EM) map of the full-length GCGR shows how a monoclonal antibody stabilizes the ECD and 7TM domain in an elongated conformation. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) studies and MD simulations indicate that an open conformation is also stabilized by peptide ligand binding. The combined studies reveal the open/closed states of GCGR and suggest that glucagon binds to GCGR by a conformational selection mechanism.",

The system uses a liquid handling robot to place up to 96 individual samples onto a single standard TEM grid at separate locations. The grid is then transferred into the TEM and automated software is used to acquire multiscale images of each sample. The images are then analyzed to extract metrics on the size, shape, and morphology of the nanoparticles. The system has been used to characterize plasmonically active nanomaterials.",

        "Abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal primarily through G proteins or arrestins. Arrestin binding to GPCRs blocks G protein interaction and redirects signalling to numerous G-protein-independent pathways. Here we report the crystal structure of a constitutively active form of human rhodopsin bound to a pre-activated form of the mouse visual arrestin, determined by serial femtosecond X-ray laser crystallography. Together with extensive biochemical and mutagenesis data, the structure reveals an overall architecture of the rhodopsin-arrestin assembly in which rhodopsin uses distinct structural elements, including transmembrane helix 7 and helix 8, to recruit arrestin. Correspondingly, arrestin adopts the pre-activated conformation, with a \u223c20\u00b0 rotation between the amino and carboxy domains, which opens up a cleft in arrestin to accommodate a short helix formed by the second intracellular loop of rhodopsin. This structure provides a basis for understanding GPCR-mediated arrestin-biased signalling and demonstrates the power of X-ray lasers for advancing the frontiers of structural biology.",

        "Abstract": "The self-assembly of oppositely charged biomacromolecules has been extensively studied due to its pertinence in the design of functional nanomaterials. Using cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM), optical light scattering, and fluorescence microscopy, we investigated the structure and phase behavior of PEGylated (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) cationic liposome-DNA nanoparticles (CL-DNA NPs) as a function of DNA length, topology (linear and circular), and \u03c1(chg) (the molar charge ratio of cationic lipid to anionic DNA). Although all NPs studied exhibited lamellar internal nanostructure, NPs formed with short (\u223c2 kbps), linear, polydisperse DNA were defect-rich and contained smaller domains. Unexpectedly, we found distinctly different equilibrium structures away from the isoelectric point. At \u03c1(chg) > 1, in the excess cationic lipid regime, threadlike micelles rich in PEG-lipid were found to coexist with NPs, cationic liposomes, and spherical micelles. At high concentrations these PEGylated threadlike micelles formed a well-ordered, patterned morphology with highly uniform intermicellar spacing. At \u03c1(chg) < 1, in the excess DNA regime and with no added salt, individual NPs were tethered together via long, linear DNA (48 kbps \u03bb-phage DNA) into a biopolymer-mediated floc. Our results provide insight into what equilibrium nanostructures can form when oppositely charged macromolecules self-assemble in aqueous media. Self-assembled, well-ordered threadlike micelles and tethered nanoparticles may have a broad range of applications in bionanotechnology, including nanoscale lithograpy and the development of lipid-based multifunctional nanoparticle networks.",

        "Abstract": "Recent developments in detector hardware and image-processing software have revolutionized single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and led to a wave of near-atomic resolution (typically \u223c3.3 \u00c5) reconstructions. Reaching resolutions higher than 3 \u00c5 is a prerequisite for structure-based drug design and for cryoEM to become widely interesting to pharmaceutical industries. We report here the structure of the 700 kDa Thermoplasma acidophilum 20S proteasome (T20S), determined at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution by single-particle cryoEM. The quality of the reconstruction enables identifying the rotameric conformation adopted by some amino-acid side chains (rotamers) and resolving ordered water molecules, in agreement with the expectations for crystal structures at similar resolutions. The results described in this manuscript demonstrate that single particle cryoEM is capable of competing with X-ray crystallography for determination of protein structures of suitable quality for rational drug design.",

        "Abstract": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporters are ubiquitously found in all kingdoms of life and their members play significant roles in mediating drug pharmacokinetics and multidrug resistance in the clinic. Significant questions and controversies remain regarding the relevance of their conformations observed in X-ray structures, their structural dynamics, and mechanism of transport. Here, we used single particle electron microscopy (EM) to delineate the entire conformational spectrum of two homologous ABC exporters (bacterial MsbA and mammalian P-glycoprotein) and the influence of nucleotide and substrate binding. Newly developed amphiphiles in complex with lipids that support high protein stability and activity enabled EM visualization of individual complexes in a membrane-mimicking environment. The data provide a comprehensive view of the conformational flexibility of these ABC exporters under various states and demonstrate not only similarities but striking differences between their mechanistic and energetic regulation of conformational changes.",

        "Abstract": "All organisms have evolved mechanisms to manage the stalling of ribosomes upon translation of aberrant mRNA. In eukaryotes, the large ribosomal subunit-associated quality control complex (RQC), composed of the listerin/Ltn1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and cofactors, mediates the ubiquitylation and extraction of ribosome-stalled nascent polypeptide chains for proteasomal degradation. How RQC recognizes stalled ribosomes and performs its functions has not been understood. Using single-particle cryoelectron microscopy, we have determined the structure of the RQC complex bound to stalled 60S ribosomal subunits. The structure establishes how Ltn1 associates with the large ribosomal subunit and properly positions its E3-catalytic RING domain to mediate nascent chain ubiquitylation. The structure also reveals that a distinguishing feature of stalled 60S particles is an exposed, nascent chain-conjugated tRNA, and that the Tae2 subunit of RQC, which facilitates Ltn1 binding, is responsible for selective recognition of stalled 60S subunits. RQC components are engaged in interactions across a large span of the 60S subunit surface, connecting the tRNA in the peptidyl transferase center to the distally located nascent chain tunnel exit. This work provides insights into a mechanism linking translation and protein degradation that targets defective proteins immediately after synthesis, while ignoring nascent chains in normally translating ribosomes.",

        "Abstract": "Ribosome assembly is a complex process involving the folding and processing of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), concomitant binding of ribosomal proteins (r-proteins), and participation of numerous accessory cofactors. Here, we use a quantitative mass spectrometry/electron microscopy hybrid approach to determine the r-protein composition and conformation of 30S ribosome assembly intermediates in Escherichia coli. The relative timing of assembly of the 3' domain and the formation of the central pseudoknot (PK) structure depends on the presence of the assembly factor RimP. The central PK is unstable in the absence of RimP, resulting in the accumulation of intermediates in which the 3'-domain is unanchored and the 5'-domain is depleted for r-proteins S5 and S12 that contact the central PK. Our results reveal the importance of the cofactor RimP in central PK formation, and introduce a broadly applicable method for characterizing macromolecular assembly in cells.",

The development of direct detectors constitutes a revolution that has led to a wave of near-atomic resolution cryoEM reconstructions. However, regardless of the sample studied, virtually all high-resolution reconstructions reported to date have been achieved using high-end microscopes. We demonstrate that the new generation of direct detectors coupled to a widely used mid-range electron microscope also enables obtaining cryoEM maps of sufficient quality for de novo modeling of protein structures of different sizes and symmetries. We provide an outline of the strategy used to achieve a 3.7 \u00c5 resolution reconstruction of Nudaurelia capensis \u03c9 virus and a 4.2 \u00c5 resolution reconstruction of the Thermoplasma acidophilum T20S proteasome.",

        "Abstract": "Aggregation of protein-based therapeutics is a challenging problem in the biopharmaceutical industry. Of particular concern are implications for product efficacy and clinical safety because of potentially increased immunogenicity of the aggregates. We used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize biophysical and morphological features of antibody aggregates formed upon controlled environmental stresses. TEM results were contrasted with results obtained in parallel by independent methods, including size-exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering, microflow imaging, and nanoparticle tracking. For TEM, stressed samples were imaged by negative staining and in the frozen-hydrated state. In both cases, aggregates appeared amorphous but differed in fine structural detail. Specifically, negatively stained aggregates were compact and consisted of smaller globular structures that had a notable three-dimensional character. Elements of the native IgG structure were retained, suggesting that the aggregates were not assembled from denatured protein. In contrast, aggregates in frozen-hydrated samples appeared as extended, branched protein networks with large surface area. Using multiple scales of magnification, a wide range of particle sizes was observed and semiquantitatively characterized.

        "Abstract": "NOSs are homodimeric multidomain enzymes responsible for producing NO. In mammals, NO acts as an intercellular messenger in a variety of signaling reactions, as well as a cytotoxin in the innate immune response. Mammals possess three NOS isoforms--inducible, endothelial, and neuronal NOS--that are composed of an N-terminal oxidase domain and a C-terminal reductase domain. Calmodulin (CaM) activates NO synthesis by binding to the helical region connecting these two domains. Although crystal structures of isolated domains have been reported, no structure is available for full-length NOS. We used high-throughput single-particle EM to obtain the structures and higher-order domain organization of all three NOS holoenzymes. The structures of inducible, endothelial, and neuronal NOS with and without CaM bound are similar, consisting of a dimerized oxidase domain flanked by two separated reductase domains. NOS isoforms adopt many conformations enabled by three flexible linkers. These conformations represent snapshots of the continuous electron transfer pathway from the reductase domain to the oxidase domain, which reveal that only a single reductase domain participates in electron transfer at a time, and that CaM activates NOS by constraining rotational motions and by directly binding to the oxidase domain. Direct visualization of these large conformational changes induced during electron transfer provides significant insight into the molecular underpinnings governing NO formation.",

        "Title": "Uptake and transfection efficiency of PEGylated cationic liposome-DNA complexes with and without RGD-tagging.",
        "Abstract": "Steric stabilization of cationic liposome-DNA (CL-DNA) complexes is required for in vivo applications such as gene therapy. PEGylation (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) of CL-DNA complexes by addition of PEG2000-lipids yields sterically stabilized nanoparticles but strongly reduces their gene delivery efficacy. PEGylation-induced weakening of the electrostatic binding of CL-DNA nanoparticles to cells (leading to reduced uptake) has been considered as a possible cause, but experimental results have been ambiguous. Using quantitative live-cell imaging in vitro, we have investigated cell attachment and uptake of PEGylated CL-DNA nanoparticles with and without a custom synthesized RGD-peptide grafted to the distal ends of PEG2000-lipids. The RGD-tagged nanoparticles exhibit strongly increased cellular attachment as well as uptake compared to nanoparticles without grafted peptide. Transfection efficiency of RGD-tagged PEGylated CL-DNA NPs increases by about an order of magnitude between NPs with low and high membrane charge density (\u03c3M; the average charge per unit area of the membrane; controlled by the molar ratio of cationic to neutral lipid), even though imaging data show that uptake of RGD-tagged particles is only slightly enhanced by high \u03c3M. This suggests that endosomal escape and, as a result, transfection efficiency of RGD-tagged NPs is facilitated by high \u03c3M. We present a model describing the interactions between PEGylated CL-DNA nanoparticles and the anionic cell membrane which shows how the PEG grafting density and membrane charge density affect adhesion of nanoparticles to the cell surface.",

        "Abstract": "Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is the primary nitric oxide (NO) receptor in mammals and a central component of the NO-signaling pathway. The NO-signaling pathways mediate diverse physiological processes, including vasodilation, neurotransmission, and myocardial functions. sGC is a heterodimer assembled from two homologous subunits, each comprised of four domains. Although crystal structures of isolated domains have been reported, no structure is available for full-length sGC. We used single-particle electron microscopy to obtain the structure of the complete sGC heterodimer and determine its higher-order domain architecture. Overall, the protein is formed of two rigid modules: the catalytic dimer and the clustered Per/Art/Sim and heme-NO/O2-binding domains, connected by a parallel coiled coil at two hinge points. The quaternary assembly demonstrates a very high degree of flexibility. We captured hundreds of individual conformational snapshots of free sGC, NO-bound sGC, and guanosine-5'-[(\u03b1,\u03b2)-methylene]triphosphate-bound sGC. The molecular architecture and pronounced flexibility observed provides a significant step forward in understanding the mechanism of NO signaling.",

We demonstrate the method using the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) VLPs in GARDASIL\u00ae. CryoTEM, coupled to automated data collection and analysis, was used to acquire images of the particles in their hydrated state, determine their morphological characteristics, and confirm the integrity of the particles when absorbed to aluminum adjuvant. In addition, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the VLPs, both alone and when interacting with neutralizing antibodies. Two modes of binding of two different neutralizing antibodies were apparent; for HPV type 11 saturated with H11.B2, 72 potential Fab binding sites were observed at the center of each capsomer, whereas for HPV 16 interacting with H16.V5, it appears that 60 pentamers (each neighboring 6 other pentamers) bind five Fabs per pentamer, for the total of 300 potential Fab binding sites per VLP.",

        "Abstract": "The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer contains the receptor binding sites and membrane fusion machinery that introduce the viral genome into the host cell. As the only target for broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), Env is a focus for rational vaccine design. We present a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction and structural model of a cleaved, soluble Env trimer (termed BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140) in complex with a CD4 binding site (CD4bs) bnAb, PGV04, at 5.8 angstrom resolution. The structure reveals the spatial arrangement of Env components, including the V1/V2, V3, HR1, and HR2 domains, as well as shielding glycans. The structure also provides insights into trimer assembly, gp120-gp41 interactions, and the CD4bs epitope cluster for bnAbs, which covers a more extensive area and defines a more complex site of vulnerability than previously described.",

        "Title": "Optimod--an automated approach for constructing and optimizing initial models for single-particle electron microscopy.",
        "Abstract": "Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy is now well established as a technique for the structural characterization of large macromolecules and macromolecular complexes. The raw data is very noisy and consists of two-dimensional projections, from which the 3D biological object must be reconstructed. The 3D object depends upon knowledge of proper angular orientations assigned to the 2D projection images. Numerous algorithms have been developed for determining relative angular orientations between 2D images, but the transition from 2D to 3D remains challenging and can result in erroneous and conflicting results. Here we describe a general, automated procedure, called OptiMod, for reconstructing and optimizing 3D models using common-lines methodologies. OptiMod approximates orientation angles and reconstructs independent maps from 2D class averages. It then iterates the procedure, while considering each map as a raw solution that needs to be compared with other possible outcomes. We incorporate procedures for 3D alignment, clustering, and refinement to optimize each map, as well as standard scoring metrics to facilitate the selection of the optimal model. We also show that small angle tilt-pair data can be included as one of the scoring metrics to improve the selection of the optimal initial model, and also to provide a validation check. The overall approach is demonstrated using two experimental cryo-EM data sets--the 80S ribosome that represents a relatively straightforward case for ab initio reconstruction, and the Tf-TfR complex that represents a challenging case in that it has previously been shown to provide multiple equally plausible solutions to the initial model problem.",

        "Abstract": "SgrAI is a sequence specific DNA endonuclease that functions through an unusual enzymatic mechanism that is allosterically activated 200- to 500-fold by effector DNA, with a concomitant expansion of its DNA sequence specificity. Using single-particle transmission electron microscopy to reconstruct distinct populations of SgrAI oligomers, we show that in the presence of allosteric, activating DNA, the enzyme forms regular, repeating helical structures characterized by the addition of DNA-binding dimeric SgrAI subunits in a run-on manner. We also present the structure of oligomeric SgrAI at 8.6 \u00c5 resolution, demonstrating the conformational state of SgrAI in its activated form. Activated and oligomeric SgrAI displays key protein-protein interactions near the helix axis between its N termini, as well as allosteric protein-DNA interactions that are required for enzymatic activation. The hybrid approach reveals an unusual mechanism of enzyme activation that explains SgrAI's oligomerization and allosteric behavior.",

These new recording devices detect electrons directly (i.e. without conversion into light) and feature significantly improved detective quantum efficiencies and readout rates as compared to photographic films or CCDs. We evaluated here the potential of one such detector (Gatan K2 Summit) to enable the achievement of near-atomic resolution reconstructions of biological specimens when coupled to a widely used, mid-range transmission electron microscope (FEI TF20 Twin). Compensating for beam-induced motion and stage drift provided a 4.4\u00c5 resolution map of Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus (STIV), which we used as a test particle in this study. Several motion correction and dose fractionation procedures were explored and we describe their influence on the resolution of the final reconstruction. We also compared the quality of this data to that collected with a FEI Titan Krios microscope equipped with a Falcon I direct detector, which provides a benchmark for data collected using a high-end electron microscope.",

By varying packaged DNA length and through addition of spermine ions, we transform the interaction energy from net repulsive to net attractive. This allowed us to isolate the effect of bending on the resulting DNA structure. We used single particle cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction analysis to determine the interstrand spacing of double-stranded DNA encapsidated in phage \u03bb capsids. The data reveal that stress and packing defects, both resulting from DNA bending in the capsid, are able to induce a long-range phase transition in the encapsidated DNA genome from a hexagonal to a cholesteric packing structure. This structural observation suggests significant changes in genome fluidity as a result of a phase transition affecting the rates of viral DNA ejection and packaging.",

        "Abstract": "Electron microscopy (EM) is an important tool for determining the composition, arrangement and structure of biological macromolecules. When studying structurally heterogeneous samples using EM, classification is a critical step toward achieving higher resolution and identifying biologically significant conformations. We have developed an interactive, web-based tool, called Maskiton, for creating custom masks and performing 2D classifications on aligned single-particle EM images. The Maskiton interface makes it considerably easier and faster to explore the significance of heterogeneity in single-particle datasets. Maskiton features include: resumable uploads to facilitate transfer of large datasets to the server, custom mask creation in the browser, continual progress updates, and interactive viewing of classification results. To demonstrate the value of this tool, we provide examples of its use on several experimental datasets and include analyses of the independent terminus mobility within the Ltn1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, the in vitro assembly of 30S ribosomal subunits, and classification complexity reduction within Immunoglobulin M. This work also serves as a proof-of-concept for the development of future cross-platform, interactive user interfaces for electron microscopy data processing.",

        "Abstract": "Ltn1 is a 180-kDa E3 ubiquitin ligase that associates with ribosomes and marks certain aberrant, translationally arrested nascent polypeptide chains for proteasomal degradation. In addition to its evolutionarily conserved large size, Ltn1 is characterized by the presence of a conserved N terminus, HEAT/ARM repeats predicted to comprise the majority of the protein, and a C-terminal catalytic RING domain, although the protein's exact structure is unknown. We used numerous single-particle EM strategies to characterize Ltn1's structure based on negative stain and vitreous ice data. Two-dimensional classifications and subsequent 3D reconstructions of electron density maps show that Ltn1 has an elongated form and presents a continuum of conformational states about two flexible hinge regions, whereas its overall architecture is reminiscent of multisubunit cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes. We propose a model of Ltn1 function based on its conformational variability and flexibility that describes how these features may play a role in cotranslational protein quality control.",

        "Abstract": "Single-particle electron microscopy (EM) is a powerful tool for studying the structures of large biological molecules. However, the achievable resolution does not always allow for direct recognition of individual protein domains. Labels that can be visualized by EM have been developed for protein termini, but tagging internal domains remains a challenge. We describe a robust strategy for determining the position of internal sites within EM maps, termed domain localization by RCT sampling (DOLORS). DOLORS uses monovalent streptavidin added posttranslationally to tagged sites in the target protein. Internal labels generally display less conformational flexibility than terminal labels, providing more precise positional information. Automated methods are used to rapidly generate assemblies of unique 3D models allowing the attachment sites of labeled domains to be accurately identified and thus provide an overall architectural map of the molecule.",

RNPs are composed of the viral genome, viral polymerase, and many copies of the viral nucleoprotein. In vitro cell expression of all RNP protein components with four of the eight influenza virus gene segments enabled structural determination of native influenza virus RNPs by means of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The cryo-EM structure reveals the architecture and organization of the native RNP, defining the attributes of its largely helical structure and how polymerase interacts with nucleoprotein and the viral genome. Observations of branched-RNP structures in negative-stain electron microscopy and their putative identification as replication intermediates suggest a mechanism for viral replication by a second polymerase on the RNP template.",

This procedure increases the efficiency of cryo-EM imaging and enhances the resolution obtained in three-dimensional reconstructions of the particle.

These VLPs are very stable, but identification of the specific molecular determinants of this stability is lacking. To investigate these determinants along with manipulations that confer more capabilities to our VLP material, we manipulated the CP primary structure to test the importance of various putative stabilizing interactions. Optimization of a procedure to incorporate fused CP subunits allowed for good control over the average number of covalent dimers in each VLP. We confirmed that the disulfide linkages are the most important stabilizing elements for the capsid and that acidic conditions significantly enhance the resistance of VLPs to thermal degradation. Interdimer interactions were found to be less important for VLP assembly than intradimer interactions. Finally, a single point mutation in the CP resulted in a population of smaller VLPs in three distinct structural forms.",

        "Abstract": "Bacteriophage HK97 maturation involves discrete intermediate particle forms, comparable to transitional states in protein folding, before reaching its mature form. The process starts by formation of a metastable prohead, poised for exothermic expansion triggered by DNA packaging. During maturation, the capsid subunit transitions from a strained to a canonical tertiary conformation and this has been postulated to be the driving mechanism for initiating expansion via switching hexameric capsomer architecture from skewed to 6-fold symmetric. We report the subnanometer electron-cryomicroscopy reconstruction of the HK97 first expansion intermediate before any crosslink formation. This form displays 6-fold symmetric hexamers, but capsid subunit tertiary structures exhibit distortions comparable to the prohead forms. We propose that coat subunit strain release acts in synergy with the first crosslinks to drive forward maturation. Finally, we speculate that the energetic features of this transition may result from increased stability of intermediates during maturation via enhanced inter-subunit interactions.",

        "Title": "Spotiton: a prototype for an integrated inkjet dispense and vitrification system for cryo-TEM.",
        "Abstract": "Over the last three decades, Cryo-TEM has developed into a powerful technique for high-resolution imaging of biological macromolecules in their native vitrified state. However, the method for vitrifying specimens onto EM grids is essentially unchanged - application of \u223c3 \u03bcL sample to a grid, followed by blotting and rapid plunge freezing into liquid ethane. Several trials are often required to obtain suitable thin (few hundred nanometers or less) vitrified layers amenable for cryo-TEM imaging, which results in waste of precious sample and resources. While commercially available instruments provide some level of automation to control the vitrification process in an effort to increase quality and reproducibility, obtaining satisfactory vitrified specimens remains a bottleneck in the Cryo-TEM pipeline. We describe here a completely novel method for EM specimen preparation based on small volume (picoliter to nanoliter) dispensing using inkjet technology. A first prototype system (Spotiton v0.5) demonstrates feasibility of this new approach for specimen vitrification. A piezo-electric inkjet dispenser is integrated with optical real-time cameras (100 Hz frame rate) to analyze picoliter to nanoliter droplet profiles in-flight and spreading dynamics on the grid, and thus provides a method to optimize timing of the process. Using TEM imaging and biochemical assays we demonstrate that the piezo-electric inkjet mechanism does not disrupt the structural or functional integrity of macromolecules. These preliminary studies provide insight into the factors and components that will need further development to enable a robust and repeatable technique for specimen vitrification using this novel approach.",

        "Abstract": "Dicer is a multidomain enzyme that generates small RNAs for gene silencing in eukaryotes. Current understanding of Dicer structure is restricted to simple forms of the enzyme, whereas that of the large and complex Dicer in metazoans is unknown. Here we describe a new domain localization strategy developed to determine the structure of human Dicer by EM. A rearrangement of the nuclease core, compared to the archetypal Giardia lamblia Dicer, explains how metazoan Dicers generate products that are 21-23 nucleotides in length. The helicase domains form a clamp-like structure adjacent to the RNase III active site, facilitating recognition of pre-miRNA loops or translocation on long dsRNAs. Drosophila melanogaster Dicer-2 shows similar features, revealing that the three-dimensional architecture is conserved. These results illuminate the structural basis for small RNA production in eukaryotes and provide a versatile new tool for determining structures of large molecular machines.",

This phage is lytic for related Vibrio species with significant ecological importance, including the broadly antagonistic bacterium Vibrio sp. SWAT3. The three-dimensional structure of the\u00a0800\u00a0\u00c5 SIO-2, icosahedrally averaged head of the\u00a0tailed particle revealed a T\u00a0= 12 quasi-symmetry not previously described in a bacteriophage. Two morphologically distinct types of auxiliary proteins were also identified; one species bound to the surface of hexamers, and the other bound to pentamers. The secondary structure, evident in the electron density, shows that the major capsid protein has the HK97-like fold. The three-dimensional structure of the procapsid form, also presented here, has no \"decoration\" proteins and reveals a capsomer organization due to the constraints of the T\u00a0= 12 symmetry.",

        "Abstract": "The contrast observed in images of frozen-hydrated biological specimens prepared for electron cryo-microscopy falls significantly short of theoretical predictions. In addition to limits imposed by the current instrumentation, it is widely acknowledged that motion of the specimen during its exposure to the electron beam leads to significant blurring in the recorded images. We have studied the amount and direction of motion of virus particles suspended in thin vitrified ice layers across holes in perforated carbon films using exposure series. Our data show that the particle motion is correlated within patches of 0.3-0.5 \u03bcm, indicating that the whole ice layer is moving in a drum-like motion, with accompanying particle rotations of up to a few degrees. Support films with smaller holes, as well as lower electron dose rates tend to reduce beam-induced specimen motion, consistent with a mechanical effect. Finally, analysis of movies showing changes in the specimen during beam exposure show that the specimen moves significantly more at the start of an exposure than towards its end. We show how alignment and averaging of movie frames can be used to restore high-resolution detail in images affected by beam-induced motion.",

        "Abstract": "Electron crystallography plays a key role in the structural biology of integral membrane proteins (IMPs) by offering one of the most direct means of providing insight into the functional state of these molecular machines in their lipid-associated forms, and also has the potential to facilitate examination of physiologically relevant transitional states and complexes. Helical or tubular crystals, which are the natural product of proteins crystallizing on the surface of a cylindrical vesicle, offer some unique advantages, such as three-dimensional (3D) information from a single view, compared to other crystalline forms. While a number of software packages are available for processing images of helical crystals to produce 3D electron density maps, widespread exploitation of helical image reconstruction is limited by a lack of standardized approaches and the initial effort and specialized expertise required. Our goal is to develop an integrated pipeline to enable structure determination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of IMPs in the form of tubular crystals. We describe here the integration of standard Fourier-Bessel helical analysis techniques into Appion, an integrated, database-driven pipeline.",

        "Abstract": "We report on initial results of using a new direct detection device (DDD) for single particle reconstruction of vitreous ice embedded specimens. Images were acquired on a Tecnai F20 at 200keV and a nominal magnification of 29,000\u00d7. This camera has a significantly improved signal to noise ratio and modulation transfer function (MTF) at 200keV compared to a standard CCD camera installed on the same microscope. Control of the DDD has been integrated into Leginon, an automated data collection system. Using GroEL as a test specimen, we obtained images of \u223c30K particles with the CCD and the DDD from the same specimen sample using essentially identical imaging conditions. Comparison of the maps reconstructed from the CCD images and the DDD images demonstrates the improved performance of the DDD. We also obtained a 3D reconstruction from \u223c70K GroEL particles acquired using the DDD; the quality of the density map demonstrates the potential of this new recording device for cryoEM data acquisition.",

We describe how three-dimensional (3D) MT bundles and 2D MT bundles may assemble, in cell free systems in the presence of counter-ions, revealing structures not predicted by polyelectrolyte theories. Interestingly, experiments reveal that the neuronal protein tau, an abundant MT-associated-protein in axons, modulates the MT diameter providing insight for the control of geometric parameters in bio- nanotechnology. In another set of experiments we describe lipid-protein-nanotubes, and lipid nano-tubes and rods, resulting from membrane shape evolution processes involving protein templates and curvature stabilizing lipids. Similar membrane shape changes, occurring in cells for the purpose of specific functions, are induced by interactions between membranes and proteins. The biological materials systems described have applications in bio-nanotechnology.",

        "Abstract": "Ribosomes are self-assembling macromolecular machines that translate DNA into proteins, and an understanding of ribosome biogenesis is central to cellular physiology. Previous studies on the Escherichia coli 30S subunit suggest that ribosome assembly occurs via multiple parallel pathways rather than through a single rate-limiting step, but little mechanistic information is known about this process. Discovery single-particle profiling (DSP), an application of time-resolved electron microscopy, was used to obtain more than 1 million snapshots of assembling 30S subunits, identify and visualize the structures of 14 assembly intermediates, and monitor the population flux of these intermediates over time. DSP results were integrated with mass spectrometry data to construct the first ribosome-assembly mechanism that incorporates binding dependencies, rate constants, and structural characterization of populated intermediates.",

        "Abstract": "Throughout the history of single-particle electron microscopy (EM), automated technologies have seen varying degrees of emphasis and development, usually depending upon the contemporary demands of the field. We are currently faced with increasingly sophisticated devices for specimen preparation, vast increases in the size of collected data sets, comprehensive algorithms for image processing, sophisticated tools for quality assessment, and an influx of interested scientists from outside the field who might lack the skills of experienced microscopists. This situation places automated techniques in high demand. In this chapter, we provide a generic definition of and discuss some of the most important advances in automated approaches to specimen preparation, grid handling, robotic screening, microscope calibrations, data acquisition, image processing, and computational infrastructure. Each section describes the general problem and then provides examples of how that problem has been addressed through automation, highlighting available processing packages, and sometimes describing the particular approach at the National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy (NRAMM). We contrast the more familiar manual procedures with automated approaches, emphasizing breakthroughs as well as current limitations. Finally, we speculate on future directions and improvements in automated technologies. Our overall goal is to present automation as more than simply a tool to save time. Rather, we aim to illustrate that automation is a comprehensive and versatile strategy that can deliver biological information on an unprecedented scale beyond the scope available with classical manual approaches.",

        "Title": "Cryomesh: a new substrate for cryo-electron microscopy.",
        "Abstract": "Here we evaluate a new grid substrate developed by ProtoChips Inc. (Raleigh, NC) for cryo-transmission electron microscopy. The new grids are fabricated from doped silicon carbide using processes adapted from the semiconductor industry. A major motivating purpose in the development of these grids was to increase the low-temperature conductivity of the substrate, a characteristic that is thought to affect the appearance of beam-induced movement (BIM) in transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of biological specimens. BIM degrades the quality of data and is especially severe when frozen biological specimens are tilted in the microscope. Our results show that this new substrate does indeed have a significant impact on reducing the appearance and severity of beam-induced movement in TEM images of tilted cryo-preserved samples. Furthermore, while we have not been able to ascertain the exact causes underlying the BIM phenomenon, we have evidence that the rigidity and flatness of these grids may play a major role in its reduction. This improvement in the reliability of imaging at tilt has a significant impact on using data collection methods such as random conical tilt or orthogonal tilt reconstruction with cryo-preserved samples. Reduction in BIM also has the potential for improving the resolution of three-dimensional cryo-reconstructions in general.",

        "Abstract": "Structure determination of a novel macromolecular complex via single-particle electron microscopy depends upon overcoming the challenge of establishing a reliable 3-D reconstruction using only 2-D images. There are a variety of strategies that deal with this issue, but not all of them are readily accessible and straightforward to use. We have developed a \"toolbox\" of ab initio reconstruction techniques that provide several options for calculating 3-D volumes in an easily managed and tightly controlled work-flow that adheres to standard conventions and formats. This toolbox is designed to streamline the reconstruction process by removing the necessity for bookkeeping, while facilitating transparent data transfer between different software packages. It currently includes procedures for calculating ab initio reconstructions via random or orthogonal tilt geometry, tomograms, and common lines, all of which have been tested using the 50S ribosomal subunit. Our goal is that the accessibility of multiple independent reconstruction algorithms via this toolbox will improve the ease with which models can be generated, and provide a means of evaluating the confidence and reliability of the final reconstructed map.",

        "Abstract": "We describe the preparation and characterization of block liposomes, a new class of liquid (chain-melted) vesicles, from mixtures of the highly charged (+16 e) multivalent cationic lipid MVLBG2 and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC). Block liposomes (BLs) consist of distinct spherical, tubular vesicles, and cylindrical micelles that remain connected, forming a single liposome. This is in contrast to typical liposome systems, where distinctly shaped liposomes are macroscopically separated. In a narrow composition range (8-10 mol% MVLBG2), an abundance of micrometer-scale BLs (typically sphere-tube-sphere triblocks) is observed. Cryo-TEM reveals that BLs are also present at the nanometer scale, where the blocks consist of distinctly shaped nanoscale spheres, pears, tubes, or rods. Pear-tube diblock and pear-tube-pear triblock liposomes contain nanotubes with inner lumen diameter 10-50 nm. In addition, sphere-rod diblock liposomes are present, containing rigid micellar nanorods approximately 4 nm in diameter and several microm in length. Block liposomes may find a range of applications in chemical and nucleic acid delivery and as building blocks in the design of templates for hierarchical structures.",

        "Title": "Structure of the human Dicer-TRBP complex by electron microscopy.",
        "Abstract": "Dicer is a specialized ribonuclease that initiates RNA interference (RNAi) by cleaving double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into small RNA fragments about 22 nucleotides long. Here, we present the three-dimensional structure of human Dicer bound to the protein TRBP at approximately 20 A resolution determined by negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) and single-particle analysis. Our analysis reveals that the Dicer-TRBP complex is an L-shaped molecule with a long edge of 150 A and a 100 A extension on one end. A surface trench runs the length of the long edge of the molecule, defining a putative dsRNA-binding site. Docking the crystal structure of Giardia Dicer, which represents the nuclease core of human Dicer, into the EM map suggests two possible overall molecular architectures for human Dicer. These results offer insights into the structure of Dicer proteins found in multicellular organisms and provide a conceptual framework for understanding the initiation of RNAi.",

        "Title": "Liquid crystalline phases of dendritic lipid-DNA self-assemblies: lamellar, hexagonal, and DNA bundles.",
        "Abstract": "The prospects of gene therapy have generated unprecedented interest in the properties and structures of complexes of nucleic acids (NAs) with cationic liposomes (CLs), which are used as nonviral NA carriers in worldwide clinical trials. An improved understanding of the mechanisms of action of CL-NA complexes is required to enable their widespread therapeutic use. In prior studies of CL-mediated DNA delivery, membrane charge density (sigma(M)) was identified as a key parameter for transfection efficiency (TE) of lamellar (L(alpha)(C)) CL-DNA complexes. The TE of CL-DNA complexes containing cationic lipids with headgroup valencies from 1+ to 5+ follows a universal bell-shaped curve as a function of sigma(M). As we report here, the TE of CL-DNA complexes containing new multivalent lipids with dendritic headgroups (DLs) strongly deviates from this curve at high sigma(M). We have investigated four DLs, MVLG2 (4+), MVLG3 (8+), MVLBisG1 (8+), and MVLBisG2 (16+), in mixtures with neutral 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerophosphatidyl-choline (DOPC). To understand the TE behavior, we have performed X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy, and cryo-TEM studies of the DL/DOPC mixtures and their DNA complexes. XRD reveals a complex phase behavior of DL-DNA complexes which strongly depends on the headgroup charge. MVLG2(4+)/DOPC-DNA complexes exhibit the lamellar phase at all molar fractions of DL, Phi(DL). In stark contrast, MVLBisG2(16+)/ DOPC-DNA complexes remain lamellar only for Phi(DL) < or = 0.2. In a narrow regime around Phi(DL) = 0.25, the hexagonal phase H(I)(C), consisting of a hexagonal lattice of cylindrical lipid micelles and a DNA honeycomb lattice, is formed. At Phi(DL) > 0.3, XRD suggests formation of a distorted H(I)(C) phase. For Phi(DL) > or = 0.5 under high salt conditions, this phase coexists with a bundle phase of DNA condensed by the depletion-attraction effect of DL micelles. The transitions at high sigma(M) from the lamellar phase to the new hexagonal phases of DL-DNA complexes coincide with the deviation from the universal TE behavior of lamellar complexes. The observed high TE, which is independent of sigma(M), strongly suggests a novel mechanism of action for these DL-DNA complex phases.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, we have reported the discovery of block liposomes (BLs), a new class of liquid (chain-melted) vesicles, formed in mixtures of the curvature-stabilizing hexadecavalent cationic lipid MVLBG2, the neutral lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and water with no added salt. BLs consist of connected spheres, pears, tubes, or rods. Unlike in typical liposome systems, where spherical vesicles, tubular vesicles, and cylindrical micelles are separated on the macroscopic scale, shapes remain connected and are separated only on the nanometer scale within a single BL. Here, we report structural studies of the effect of salt and pH on the BL phase, carried out using differential interference contrast microscopy (DIC) and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). Addition of salt screens the electrostatic interactions; in low-salt conditions, partial screening of electrostatic interactions leads to a shape transition from BLs to bilamellar vesicles, while in the high-salt regime, a shape transition from BLs to liposomes with spherical morphologies occurs. This demonstrates that strong electrostatic interactions are essential for BL formation. Understanding the control of liposome shape evolution is of high interest because such shape changes play an important role in many intracellular processes such as endocytosis, endoplasmatic reticulum-associated vesiculation, vesicle recycling and signaling.",

        "Abstract": "The portal channel is a key component in the life cycle of bacteriophages and herpesviruses. The bacteriophage P22 portal is a 1 megadalton dodecameric oligomer of gp1 that plays key roles in capsid assembly, DNA packaging, assembly of the infection machinery, and DNA ejection. The portal is the nucleation site for the assembly of 39 additional subunits generated from multiple copies of four gene products (gp4, gp10, gp9, and gp26), which together form the multifunctional tail machine. These components are organized with a combination of 12-fold (gp1, gp4), 6-fold (gp10, trimers of gp9), and 3-fold (gp26, gp9) symmetry. Here we present the 3-dimensional structures of the P22 assembly-naive portal formed from expressed subunits (gp1) and the intact tail machine purified from infectious virions. The assembly-naive portal structure exhibits a striking structural similarity to the structures of the portal proteins of SPP1 and phi29 derived from X-ray crystallography.",

Our vision for this technique is to provide a straightforward manner in which users can proceed from raw data to a reliable 3D reconstruction through a pipeline that both facilitates management of the processing steps and makes the results at each step more transparent. Tightly integrated with a relational SQL database, Appion is a modular and transparent pipeline that extends existing software applications and procedures. The user manages and controls the software modules via web-based forms, and all results are similarly available using web-based viewers directly linked to the underlying database, enabling even naive users to quickly deduce the quality of their results. The Appion API was designed with the principle that applications should be compatible with a broad range of specimens and that libraries and routines are modular and extensible. Presented here is a description of the design and architecture of the working Appion pipeline prototype and some results of its use.",

        "Abstract": "We report on the discovery of block liposomes, a new class of chain-melted (liquid) vesicles, with membranes comprised of mixtures of the membrane-curvature-stabilizing multivalent lipid MVLBG2 of colossal charge +16 e and neutral 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC). In a narrow MVLBG2 composition range (8-10 mol%), cryo-TEM revealed block liposomes consisting of distinctly shaped, yet connected, nanoscale spheres, pears, tubes, or rods. Unlike typical liposome systems, where spherical vesicles, tubular vesicles, and cylindrical micelles are separated on the macroscopic scale, within a block liposome, shapes are separated on the nanometer scale. Diblock (pear-tube) and triblock (pear-tube-pear) liposomes contain nanotubes with inner lumen diameter of 10-50 nm. Diblock (sphere-rod) liposomes were found to contain micellar nanorods approximately 4 nm in diameter and several micrometers in length, analogous to cytoskeletal filaments of eukaryotic cells. Block liposomes may find a range of applications in chemical and nucleic acid delivery and as building blocks in the design of templates for hierarchical structures.",

        "Abstract": "We report the cryo-EM structure of bacteriophage lambda and the mechanism for stabilizing the 20-A-thick capsid containing the dsDNA genome. The crystal structure of the HK97 bacteriophage capsid fits most of the T = 7 lambda particle density with only minor adjustment. A prominent surface feature at the 3-fold axes corresponds to the cementing protein gpD, which is necessary for stabilization of the capsid shell. Its position coincides with the location of the covalent cross-link formed in the docked HK97 crystal structure, suggesting an evolutionary replacement of this gene product in lambda by autocatalytic chemistry in HK97. The crystal structure of the trimeric gpD, in which the 14 N-terminal residues required for capsid binding are disordered, fits precisely into the corresponding EM density. The N-terminal residues of gpD are well ordered in the cryo-EM density, adding a strand to a beta-sheet formed by the capsid proteins and explaining the mechanism of particle stabilization.",

        "Abstract": "Using cryo-electron microscopy, we have solved the structure of an icosidodecahedral COPII coat involved in cargo export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) coassembled from purified cargo adaptor Sec23-24 and Sec13-31 lattice-forming complexes. The coat structure shows a tetrameric assembly of the Sec23-24 adaptor layer that is well positioned beneath the vertices and edges of the Sec13-31 lattice. Fitting the known crystal structures of the COPII proteins into the density map reveals a flexible hinge region stemming from interactions between WD40 beta-propeller domains present in Sec13 and Sec31 at the vertices. The structure shows that the hinge region can direct geometric cage expansion to accommodate a wide range of bulky cargo, including procollagen and chylomicrons, that is sensitive to adaptor function in inherited disease. The COPII coat structure leads us to propose a mechanism by which cargo drives cage assembly and membrane curvature for budding from the ER.",

        "Abstract": "It is becoming routine for cryoEM single particle reconstructions to result in 3D electron density maps with resolutions of approximately 10A, but maps with resolutions of 5A or better are still celebrated events. The electron microscope has a resolving power to better than 2A, and thus should not be a limiting factor; instead the practical limitations in resolution most likely arise from a combination of specimen preparation methods, data collection parameters, and data analysis procedures. With the aid of a highly automated system for acquiring images, coupled to a relational database to keep track of all processing parameters, we have taken a systematic approach to optimizing parameters affecting the resolution of single particle reconstructions. Using GroEL as a test-bed, we performed a series of 3D reconstructions where we systematically varied the number of particles used in computing the map, the accelerating voltage of the microscope, and the electron dose used to acquire the images. We also investigated methods for excluding unacceptable or \"bad\" particles from contributing to the final 3D map. Using relatively standard instrumentation (Tecnai F20, 4K x 4K CCD, side entry cold stage) and a completely automated approach, these approaches resulted in a map with a nominal resolution of 5.4A (FSC(0.5)) in which secondary structure is clearly discernable and the handedness of some of the alpha-helices in the GroEL structure can be determined.",

The substitution does not affect the ability of the particles to self-assemble into icosahedral structures indistinguishable from native forms. The azide and alkyne groups were addressed by Cu(I)-catalyzed [3 + 2] cycloaddition: HBV particles were decomposed by the formation of more than 120 triazole linkages per capsid in a location-dependent manner, whereas Qbeta suffered no such instability. The marriage of these well-known techniques of sense-codon reassignment and bioorthogonal chemical coupling provides the capability to construct polyvalent particles displaying a wide variety of functional groups with near-perfect control of spacing.",

        "Abstract": "Screening trials to determine the presence of two-dimensional (2D) protein crystals suitable for three-dimensional structure determination using electron crystallography is a very labor-intensive process. Methods compatible with fully automated screening have been developed for the process of crystal production by dialysis and for producing negatively stained grids of the resulting trials. Further automation via robotic handling of the EM grids, and semi-automated transmission electron microscopic imaging and evaluation of the trial grids is also possible. We, and others, have developed working prototypes for several of these tools and tested and evaluated them in a simple screen of 24 crystallization conditions. While further development of these tools is certainly required for a turn-key system, the goal of fully automated screening appears to be within reach.",

        "Abstract": "Two issues that often impact the cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) specimen preparation process are agglomeration of particles near hole edges in holey carbon films and variations in vitreous ice thickness. In many cases, the source of these issues was identified to be the residues and topography often seen in commercially available films. To study and minimize their impact during specimen preparation, an improved holey carbon film has been developed. Rather than using a consumable template based on soft materials that must be removed prior to grid assembly, a method was developed that uses a hard template and a water-soluble release layer to replicate the template pattern into the carbon films. The advantages of this method are the improved purity and flatness of the carbon films, and these attributes are shown to have a dramatic improvement on the distribution of single particles embedded in vitreous ice suspended across the holes. Improving particle distribution is an enabling factor toward increasing the throughput of data collection for cryoEM.",

        "Abstract": "Visualization by electron microscopy has provided many insights into the composition, quaternary structure, and mechanism of macromolecular assemblies. By preserving samples in stain or vitreous ice it is possible to image them as discrete particles, and from these images generate three-dimensional structures. This 'single-particle' approach suffers from two major shortcomings; it requires an initial model to reconstitute 2D data into a 3D volume, and it often fails when faced with conformational variability. Random conical tilt (RCT) and orthogonal tilt (OTR) are methods developed to overcome these problems, but the data collection required, particularly for vitreous ice specimens, is difficult and tedious. In this paper, we present an automated approach to RCT/OTR data collection that removes the burden of manual collection and offers higher quality and throughput than is otherwise possible. We show example datasets collected under stain and cryo conditions and provide statistics related to the efficiency and robustness of the process. Furthermore, we describe the new algorithms that make this method possible, which include new calibrations, improved targeting and feature-based tracking.",

        "Abstract": "One of the goals in developing our automated electron microscopy data acquisition system, Leginon, was to improve both the ease of use and the throughput of the process of acquiring low dose images of macromolecular specimens embedded in vitreous ice. In this article, we demonstrate the potential of the Leginon system for high-throughput data acquisition by describing an experiment in which we acquired images of more than 280,000 particles of GroEL in a single 25 h session at the microscope. We also demonstrate the potential for an automated pipeline for molecular microscopy by showing that these particles can be subjected to completely automated procedures to reconstruct a three-dimensional (3D) density map to a resolution better than 8 A. In generating the 3D maps, we used a variety of metadata associated with the data acquisition and processing steps to sort and select the particles. These metadata provide a number of insights into factors that affect the quality of the acquired images and the resulting reconstructions. In particular, we show that the resolution of the reconstructed 3D density maps improves with decreasing ice thickness. These data provide a basis for assessing the capabilities of high-throughput macromolecular microscopy.",

        "Abstract": "The development of automated systems for data acquisition in cryo electron microscopy has enabled the possibility of acquiring very large number of images from a single specimen grid. We have demonstrated that over images of 250,000 single particles can be acquired in a 24 h period. This has raised questions as to whether contamination buildup on the specimen limits the quality of the data that can be acquired during these long duration experiments and also whether the data acquisition session could be extended to allow acquisition of more than 1,000,000 particles. We report here a systematic characterization of contamination of specimens maintained for long periods of time at liquid nitrogen temperatures using standard side entry cryo stages. As part of this characterization we developed a more reliable method for accurately estimating specimen ice thickness. Using the method, we were able to calibrate image contrast against ice thickness under a variety of magnifications, objective aperture positions, and defoci, and demonstrated the strong dependence of the calibration curve on these parameters. The results show the anti-contamination aperture is, as expected, critical to the prevention of contamination and that loading film into the microscope dramatically increases the contamination rate, particularly in the first 3 h after the insertion of the film box. In the absence of film, we were able to reproducibly demonstrate that the contamination rate can be limited to a rate of approximately 1 angstrom/h providing reassurance that contamination will not be a major limiting factor for long term cryoEM experiments if a CCD camera is used for the imaging.",

        "Abstract": "Endomembranes of eukaryotic cells are dynamic structures that are in continuous communication through the activity of specialized cellular machineries, such as the coat protein complex II (COPII), which mediates cargo export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). COPII consists of the Sar1 GTPase, Sec23 and Sec24 (Sec23/24), where Sec23 is a Sar1-specific GTPase-activating protein and Sec24 functions in cargo selection, and Sec13 and Sec31 (Sec13/31), which has a structural role. Whereas recent results have shown that Sec23/24 and Sec13/31 can self-assemble to form COPII cage-like particles, we now show that Sec13/31 can self-assemble to form minimal cages in the absence of Sec23/24. We present a three-dimensional reconstruction of these Sec13/31 cages at 30 A resolution using cryo-electron microscopy and single particle analysis. These results reveal a novel cuboctahedron geometry with the potential to form a flexible lattice and to generate a diverse range of containers. Our data are consistent with a model for COPII coat complex assembly in which Sec23/24 has a non-structural role as a multivalent ligand localizing the self-assembly of Sec13/31 to form a cage lattice driving ER cargo export.",

        "Abstract": "We present a completely automated algorithm for estimating the parameters of the contrast transfer function (CTF) of a transmission electron microscope. The primary contribution of this paper is the determination of the astigmatism prior to the estimation of the CTF parameters. The CTF parameter estimation is then reduced to a 1D problem using elliptical averaging. We have also implemented an automated method to calculate lower and upper cutoff frequencies to eliminate regions of the power spectrum which perturb the estimation of the CTF parameters. The algorithm comprises three optimization subproblems, two of which are proven to be convex. Results of the CTF estimation method are presented for images of carbon support films as well as for images of single particles embedded in ice and suspended over holes in the support film. A MATLAB implementation of the algorithm, called ACE, is freely available.",

The new flexible architecture was designed to allow for the development of customized data collection protocols, several of which are described here. The system has been used to acquire data for approximately 150 experiments and we have demonstrated the capacity for high throughput data acquisition by acquiring images of more than 100,000 particles in a single session at the microscope.",

We present a detailed description of the system that utilizes a 6 axis articulate robotic arm to load microscope grids into a specimen holder and then load the holder into the microscope. Grids are stored in trays with a capacity of 96 that are based on the format of a standard 96-well microtiter plate. The system has been integrated with an FEI Tecnai microscope and does not require any modification to the microscope and only minor modifications to the specimen holder. Preliminary results regarding cycle time, failure rates, positioning accuracy and a 96 grid screening experiment are presented.",

        "Abstract": "Manual selection of single particles in images acquired using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) will become a significant bottleneck when datasets of a hundred thousand or even a million particles are required for structure determination at near atomic resolution. Algorithm development of fully automated particle selection is thus an important research objective in the cryoEM field. A number of research groups are making promising new advances in this area. Evaluation of algorithms using a standard set of cryoEM images is an essential aspect of this algorithm development. With this goal in mind, a particle selection \"bakeoff\" was included in the program of the Multidisciplinary Workshop on Automatic Particle Selection for cryoEM. Twelve groups participated by submitting the results of testing their own algorithms on a common dataset. The dataset consisted of 82 defocus pairs of high-magnification micrographs, containing keyhole limpet hemocyanin particles, acquired using cryoEM. The results of the bakeoff are presented in this paper along with a summary of the discussion from the workshop. It was agreed that establishing benchmark particles and using bakeoffs to evaluate algorithms are useful in promoting algorithm development for fully automated particle selection, and that the infrastructure set up to support the bakeoff should be maintained and extended to include larger and more varied datasets, and more criteria for future evaluations.",

        "Abstract": "Although the methodology of molecular microscopy has enormous potential, it is time consuming and labor intensive. The techniques required to produce a three-dimensional (3D) electron density map of a macromolecular structure normally require manual operation of an electron microscope by a skilled operator and manual supervision of the sometimes complex software needed for analysis and calculation of 3D maps. Systems to automate the process of data acquisition from an electron microscope are being developing and these systems are being integrated with specimen handling operations and post acquisition data processing. Here, the current performance of our existing systems and the future challenges involved in substantially improving both the sustained throughput and the yield of automated data collection and analysis are reported.",

        "Abstract": "We have reconstructed a three-dimensional map of keyhole limpet hemocyanin isoform 1 (KLH1), using our automated data collection software, Leginon, integrated with particle selection algorithms, and the SPIDER reconstruction package. KLH1, a 7.9 MDa macromolecule, is an extracellular respiratory pigment composed of two asymmetric decamers, and presents an overall D(5) point-group symmetry. The reconstruction is in agreement with previous data published on molluscan hemocyanins. The reconstructed map (11.3A resolution, 3sigma criterion) was used to fit an available X-ray crystallography structure of Octopus dofleini Odg, solved at 2.3A [J. Mol. Biol. 278 (4) (1998) 855], with satisfactory results. The results validate the approach of automating the cryoEM process and demonstrate that the quality of the images acquired and the particles selected is comparable to those obtained using manual methods. Several problems remain to be solved however before these results can be generalized.",

        "Title": "Automatic particle detection through efficient Hough transforms.",
        "Abstract": "Manual selection of single particles in images acquired using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) will become a significant bottleneck when a very large number of images are required to achieve three-dimensional reconstructions at near atomic resolution. Investigation of fast, accurate approaches for automatic particle detection has become one of the current challenges in the cryoEM community. At the same time, the investigation is hampered by the fact that few benchmark particles or image datasets exist in the community. The unavailability of such data makes it difficult to evaluate newly developed algorithms and to leverage expertise from other disciplines. The paper presents our recent contribution to this effort. It also describes our newly developed computational framework for particle detection, through the application of edge detection and a sequence of ordered Hough transforms. Experimental results using keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as a model particle are very promising. In addition, it introduces a newly established web site, designed to support the investigation of automatic particle detection by providing an annotated image dataset of KLH available to the general scientific community.",
