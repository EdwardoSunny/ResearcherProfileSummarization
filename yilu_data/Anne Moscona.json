        "Abstract": "Science is humanity's best insurance against threats from nature, but it is a fragile enterprise that must be nourished and protected. The preponderance of scientific evidence indicates a natural origin for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the theory that SARS-CoV-2 was engineered in and escaped from a lab dominates media attention, even in the absence of strong evidence. We discuss how the resulting anti-science movement puts the research community, scientific research, and pandemic preparedness at risk.",

        "Abstract": "Measles virus (MeV) presents a public health threat that is escalating as vaccine coverage in the general population declines and as populations of immunocompromised individuals, who cannot be vaccinated, increase. There are no approved therapeutics for MeV. Neutralizing antibodies targeting viral fusion are one potential therapeutic approach but have not yet been structurally characterized or advanced to clinical use. We present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of prefusion F alone [2.1-angstrom (\u00c5) resolution], F complexed with a fusion-inhibitory peptide (2.3-\u00c5 resolution), F complexed with the neutralizing and protective monoclonal antibody (mAb) 77 (2.6-\u00c5 resolution), and an additional structure of postfusion F (2.7-\u00c5 resolution). In vitro assays and examination of additional EM classes show that mAb 77 binds prefusion F, arrests F in an intermediate state, and prevents transition to the postfusion conformation. These structures shed light on antibody-mediated neutralization that involves arrest of fusion proteins in an intermediate state.",

        "Abstract": "Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV3) is a respiratory pathogen that can cause severe disease in older people and infants. Currently, vaccines against hPIV3 are in clinical trials but none have been approved yet. The haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) surface glycoproteins of hPIV3 are major antigenic determinants. Here we describe naturally occurring potently neutralizing human antibodies directed against both surface glycoproteins of hPIV3. We isolated seven neutralizing HN-reactive antibodies and a pre-fusion conformation F-reactive antibody from human memory B cells. One HN-binding monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated PIV3-23, exhibited functional attributes including haemagglutination and neuraminidase inhibition. We also delineated the structural basis of neutralization for two HN and one F mAbs. MAbs that neutralized hPIV3 in vitro protected against infection and disease in vivo in a cotton rat model of hPIV3 infection, suggesting correlates of protection for hPIV3 and the potential clinical utility of these mAbs.",

        "Abstract": "In the United States (US), biosafety and biosecurity oversight of research on viruses is being reappraised. Safety in virology research is paramount and oversight frameworks should be reviewed periodically. Changes should be made with care, however, to avoid impeding science that is essential for rapidly reducing and responding to pandemic threats as well as addressing more common challenges caused by infectious diseases. Decades of research uniquely positioned the US to be able to respond to the COVID-19 crisis with astounding speed, delivering life-saving vaccines within a year of identifying the virus. We should embolden and empower this strength, which is a vital part of protecting the health, economy, and security of US citizens. Herein, we offer our perspectives on priorities for revised rules governing virology research in the US.",

        "Abstract": "Cell entry by SARS-CoV-2 is accomplished by the S2 subunit of the spike S protein on the virion surface by capture of the host cell membrane and fusion with the viral envelope. Capture and fusion require the prefusion S2 to transit to its potent fusogenic form, the fusion intermediate (FI). However, the FI structure is unknown, detailed computational models of the FI are unavailable, and the mechanisms and timing of membrane capture and fusion are not established. Here, we constructed a full-length model of the SARS-CoV-2 FI by extrapolating from known SARS-CoV-2 pre- and postfusion structures. In atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations the FI was remarkably flexible and executed giant bending and extensional fluctuations due to three hinges in the C-terminal base. The simulated configurations and their giant fluctuations are quantitatively consistent with SARS-CoV-2 FI configurations measured recently using cryo-electron tomography. Simulations suggested a host cell membrane capture time of \u223c2 ms. Isolated fusion peptide simulations identified an N-terminal helix that directed and maintained binding to the membrane but grossly underestimated the binding time, showing that the fusion peptide environment is radically altered when attached to its host fusion protein. The large configurational fluctuations of the FI generated a substantial exploration volume that aided capture of the target membrane, and may set the waiting time for fluctuation-triggered refolding of the FI that draws the viral envelope and host cell membrane together for fusion. These results describe the FI as machinery that uses massive configurational fluctuations for efficient membrane capture and suggest novel potential drug targets.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection for most children results in mild or minimal symptoms, though in rare cases severe disease can develop, including a multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) with myocarditis. Here, we present longitudinal profiling of immune responses during acute disease and following recovery in children who developed MIS-C, relative to children who experienced more typical symptoms of COVID-19. T cells in acute MIS-C exhibited transient signatures of activation, inflammation, and tissue residency which correlated with cardiac disease severity, while T cells in acute COVID-19 upregulated markers of follicular helper T cells for promoting antibody production. The resultant memory immune response in recovery showed increased frequencies of virus-specific memory T cells with pro-inflammatory functions in children with prior MIS-C compared to COVID-19 while both cohorts generated comparable antibody responses. Together our results reveal distinct effector and memory T cell responses in pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection delineated by clinical syndrome, and a potential role for tissue-derived T cells in the immune pathology of systemic disease.",

        "Abstract": "Paramyxoviruses-including important pathogens like parainfluenza, measles, and Nipah viruses-use a receptor binding protein [hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) for parainfluenza] and a fusion protein (F), acting in a complex, to enter cells. We use cryo-electron tomography to visualize the fusion complex of human parainfluenza virus 3 (HN/F) on the surface of authentic clinical viruses at a subnanometer resolution sufficient to answer mechanistic questions. An HN loop inserts in a pocket on F, showing how the fusion complex remains in a ready but quiescent state until activation. The globular HN heads are rotated with respect to each other: one downward to contact F, and the other upward to grapple cellular receptors, demonstrating how HN/F performs distinct steps before F activation. This depiction of viral fusion illuminates potentially druggable targets for paramyxoviruses and sheds light on fusion processes that underpin wide-ranging biological processes but have not been visualized in situ or at the present resolution.",

        "Abstract": "Viruses have brought humanity many challenges: respiratory infection, cancer, neurological impairment and immunosuppression to name a few. Virology research over the last 60+ years has responded to reduce this disease burden with vaccines and antivirals. Despite this long history, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented attention to the field of virology. Some of this attention is focused on concern about the safe conduct of research with human pathogens. A small but vocal group of individuals has seized upon these concerns - conflating legitimate questions about safely conducting virus-related research with uncertainties over the origins of SARS-CoV-2. The result has fueled public confusion and, in many instances, ill-informed condemnation of virology. With this article, we seek to promote a return to rational discourse. We explain the use of gain-of-function approaches in science, discuss the possible origins of SARS-CoV-2 and outline current regulatory structures that provide oversight for virological research in the United States. By offering our expertise, we - a broad group of working virologists - seek to aid policy makers in navigating these controversial issues. Balanced, evidence-based discourse is essential to addressing public concern while maintaining and expanding much-needed research in virology.",

        "Abstract": "Viruses have brought humanity many challenges: respiratory infection, cancer, neurological impairment and immunosuppression to name a few. Virology research over the last 60+ years has responded to reduce this disease burden with vaccines and antivirals. Despite this long history, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented attention to the field of virology. Some of this attention is focused on concern about the safe conduct of research with human pathogens. A small but vocal group of individuals has seized upon these concerns - conflating legitimate questions about safely conducting virus-related research with uncertainties over the origins of SARS-CoV-2. The result has fueled public confusion and, in many instances, ill-informed condemnation of virology. With this article, we seek to promote a return to rational discourse. We explain the use of gain-of-function approaches in science, discuss the possible origins of SARS-CoV-2 and outline current regulatory structures that provide oversight for virological research in the United States. By offering our expertise, we - a broad group of working virologists - seek to aid policy makers in navigating these controversial issues. Balanced, evidence-based discourse is essential to addressing public concern while maintaining and expanding much-needed research in virology.",

        "Abstract": "Viruses have brought humanity many challenges: respiratory infection, cancer, neurological impairment and immunosuppression to name a few. Virology research over the last 60+ years has responded to reduce this disease burden with vaccines and antivirals. Despite this long history, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented attention to the field of virology. Some of this attention is focused on concern about the safe conduct of research with human pathogens. A small but vocal group of individuals has seized upon these concerns - conflating legitimate questions about safely conducting virus-related research with uncertainties over the origins of SARS-CoV-2. The result has fueled public confusion and, in many instances, ill-informed condemnation of virology. With this article, we seek to promote a return to rational discourse. We explain the use of gain-of-function approaches in science, discuss the possible origins of SARS-CoV-2 and outline current regulatory structures that provide oversight for virological research in the United States. By offering our expertise, we - a broad group of working virologists - seek to aid policy makers in navigating these controversial issues. Balanced, evidence-based discourse is essential to addressing public concern while maintaining and expanding much-needed research in virology.",

        "Abstract": "Measles is the most contagious airborne viral infection and the leading cause of child death among vaccine-preventable diseases. We show here that aerosolized lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, derived from heptad-repeat regions of the measles virus (MeV) fusion protein, blocks respiratory MeV infection in a non-human primate model, the cynomolgus macaque. We use a custom-designed mesh nebulizer to ensure efficient aerosol delivery of peptide to the respiratory tract and demonstrate the absence of adverse effects and lung pathology in macaques. The nebulized peptide efficiently prevents MeV infection, resulting in the complete absence of MeV RNA, MeV-infected cells, and MeV-specific humoral responses in treated animals. This strategy provides an additional means to fight against respiratory infection in non-vaccinated people,\u00a0that can be readily translated to human trials. It\u00a0presents a proof-of-concept for the aerosol delivery of fusion inhibitory peptides to protect against measles and other airborne viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, in case of high-risk exposure.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 cell entry is completed after viral spike (S) protein-mediated membrane fusion between viral and host cell membranes. Stable prefusion and postfusion S structures have been resolved by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, but the refolding intermediates on the fusion pathway are transient and have not been examined. We used an antiviral lipopeptide entry inhibitor to arrest S protein refolding and thereby capture intermediates as S proteins interact with hACE2 and fusion-activating proteases on cell-derived target membranes. Cryo-electron tomography imaged both extended and partially folded intermediate states of S2, as well as a novel late-stage conformation on the pathway to membrane fusion. The intermediates now identified in this dynamic S protein-directed fusion provide mechanistic insights that may guide the design of CoV entry inhibitors.",

        "Abstract": "Measles virus (MV) is a highly contagious respiratory virus responsible for outbreaks associated with significant morbidity and mortality among children and young adults. Although safe and effective measles vaccines are available, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in vaccination coverage gaps that may lead to the resurgence of measles when restrictions are lifted. This puts individuals who cannot be vaccinated, such as young infants and immunocompromised individuals, at risk. Therapeutic interventions are complicated by the long incubation time of measles, resulting in a narrow treatment window. At present, the only available WHO-advised option is treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins, although this is not approved as standard of care. Antivirals against measles may contribute to intervention strategies to limit the impact of future outbreaks. Here, we review previously described antivirals and antiviral assays, evaluate the antiviral efficacy of a number of compounds to inhibit MV dissemination in vitro, and discuss potential application in specific target populations. We conclude that broadly reactive antivirals could strengthen existing intervention strategies to limit the impact of measles outbreaks.",

        "Abstract": "The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to evolve in response to selective pressures poses a challenge to vaccine and antiviral efficacy. The S1 subunit of the spike (S) protein contains the receptor-binding domain and is therefore under selective pressure to evade neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccination or infection. In contrast, the S2 subunit of S is only transiently exposed after receptor binding, which makes it a less efficient target for antibodies. As a result, S2 has a lower mutational frequency than S1. We recently described monomeric and dimeric SARS-CoV-2 fusion-inhibitory lipopeptides that block viral infection by interfering with S2 conformational rearrangements during viral entry. Importantly, a dimeric lipopeptide was shown to block SARS-CoV-2 transmission between ferrets ",

        "Abstract": "Measles is the most contagious airborne viral infection and the leading cause of child death among vaccine-preventable diseases. We show here that aerosolized lipopeptide fusion inhibitors, derived from heptad-repeat regions of the measles virus (MeV) fusion protein, block respiratory MeV infection in a non-human primate model, the cynomolgus macaque. We used a custom-designed mesh nebulizer to ensure efficient aerosol delivery of peptides to the respiratory tract and demonstrated the absence of adverse effects and lung pathology in macaques. The nebulized peptide efficiently prevented MeV infection, resulting in the complete absence of MeV RNA, MeV-infected cells, and MeV-specific humoral responses in treated animals. This strategy provides an additional shield which complements vaccination to fight against respiratory infection, presenting a proof-of-concept for the aerosol delivery of fusion inhibitory peptides to protect against measles and other airborne viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, in case of high-risk exposure, that can be readily translated to human trials.",

HPIV-3 infections are currently untreatable with licensed therapeutics, and prophylactic and therapeutic options are needed for patients at risk. To complement existing human airway models of HPIV-3 infection and develop an animal model to assess novel intervention strategies, we evaluated infection and transmission of HPIV-3 in ferrets. A well-characterized human clinical isolate (CI) of HPIV-3 engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (rHPIV-3 CI-1-EGFP) was passaged on primary human airway epithelial cells (HAE) or airway organoids (AO) to avoid tissue culture adaptations. rHPIV3 CI-1-EGFP infection was assessed ",

        "Abstract": "Parainfluenza viruses, members of the enveloped, negative-sense, single stranded RNA Paramyxoviridae family, impact global child health as the cause of significant lower respiratory tract infections. Parainfluenza viruses enter cells by fusing directly at the cell surface membrane. How this fusion occurs via the coordinated efforts of the two molecules that comprise the viral surface fusion complex, and how these efforts may be blocked, are the subjects of this chapter. The receptor binding protein of parainfluenza forms a complex with the fusion protein of the virus, remaining stably associated until a receptor is reached. At that point, the receptor binding protein actively triggers the fusion protein to undergo a series of transitions that ultimately lead to membrane fusion and viral entry. In recent years it has become possible to examine this remarkable process on the surface of viral particles and to begin to understand the steps in the transition of this molecular machine, using a structural biology approach. Understanding the steps in entry leads to several possible strategies to prevent fusion and inhibit infection.",

        "Abstract": "The capacity of respiratory viruses to undergo evolution within the respiratory tract raises the possibility of evolution under the selective pressure of the host environment or drug treatment. Long-term infections in immunocompromised hosts are potential drivers of viral evolution and development of infectious variants. We showed that intrahost evolution in chronic human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) infection in immunocompromised individuals elicited mutations that favored viral entry and persistence, suggesting that similar processes may operate across enveloped respiratory viruses. We profiled longitudinal HPIV3 infections from 2 immunocompromised individuals that persisted for 278 and 98 days. Mutations accrued in the HPIV3 attachment protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), including the first in vivo mutation in HN's receptor binding site responsible for activating the viral fusion process. Fixation of this mutation was associated with exposure to a drug that cleaves host-cell sialic acid moieties. Longitudinal adaptation of HN was associated with features that promote viral entry and persistence in cells, including greater avidity for sialic acid and more active fusion activity in vitro, but not with antibody escape. Long-term infection thus led to mutations promoting viral persistence, suggesting that host-directed therapeutics may support the evolution of viruses that alter their biophysical characteristics to persist in the face of these agents in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic of COVID-19 since its emergence in December 2019. The infection causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome and may also spread to central nervous system leading to neurological sequelae. We have developed and characterized two new organotypic cultures from hamster brainstem and lung tissues that offer a unique opportunity to study the early steps of viral infection and screening antivirals. These models are not dedicated to investigate how the virus reaches the brain. However, they allow validating the early tropism of the virus in the lungs and demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 could infect the brainstem and the cerebellum, mainly by targeting granular neurons. Viral infection induces specific interferon and innate immune responses with patterns specific to each organ, along with cell death by apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis. Overall, our data illustrate the potential of rapid modeling of complex tissue-level interactions during infection by a newly emerged virus.",

        "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is ongoing and has shown the community that flexible methods for rapidly identifying and screening candidate antivirals are needed. Assessing virus-neutralizing activity of human serum to monitor population immunity and response to infection and vaccination is key to pandemic control. We developed a virus neutralization platform strategy that relies only on bioinformatic and genetic information of the virus of interest. The platform uses viral envelope glycoprotein cDNAs to set up an assay that mimics multicycle infection but is safe and, therefore, amenable to biosafety level 2 (BSL2) conditions for viruses that require BSL3 facilities (e.g., SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2). As a complement to this platform, we present a new cell-based immunofluorescent (CBI) assay that uses SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S)-expressing cells to accurately measure the neutralization potential of human sera and is readily adaptable to variants of concern. These methods should be useful additions to the tools for assessing antiviral immunity, whether acquired via natural infection or vaccines. ",

As eradication of MeV stalls, and vulnerable populations expand, effective antivirals against MeV are in high demand. Here, we describe the development of an antiviral peptide that targets the MeV fusion (F) protein. This antiviral peptide construct is composed of a carbobenzoxy-d-Phe-l-Phe-Gly (fusion inhibitor peptide; FIP) conjugated to a lipidated MeV F C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) domain derivative.

        "Abstract": "The lower respiratory tract infections affecting children worldwide are in large part caused by the parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), particularly HPIV3, along with human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses. There are no vaccines for these important human pathogens, and existing treatments have limited or no efficacy. Infection by HPIV is initiated by viral glycoprotein-mediated fusion between viral and host cell membranes. A viral fusion protein (F), once activated in proximity to a target cell, undergoes a series of conformational changes that first extend the trimer subunits to allow insertion of the hydrophobic domains into the target cell membrane and then refold the trimer into a stable postfusion state, driving the merger of the viral and host cell membranes. Lipopeptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) domain of HPIV3 F inhibit infection by interfering with the structural transitions of the trimeric F assembly. Clinical application of this strategy, however, requires improving the ",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is initiated by membrane fusion between the viral and host cell membranes, which is mediated by the viral spike protein. We have designed lipopeptide fusion inhibitors that block this critical first step of infection and, on the basis of in vitro efficacy and in vivo biodistribution, selected a dimeric form for evaluation in an animal model. Daily intranasal administration to ferrets completely prevented SARS-CoV-2 direct-contact transmission during 24-hour cohousing with infected animals, under stringent conditions that resulted in infection of 100% of untreated animals. These lipopeptides are highly stable and thus may readily translate into safe and effective intranasal prophylaxis to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",

        "Abstract": "The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has erupted into a global pandemic that has led to tens of millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. The development of therapeutics to treat infection or as prophylactics to halt viral transmission and spread is urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 relies on structural rearrangements within a spike (S) glycoprotein to mediate fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Here, we describe the development of a lipopeptide that is derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) domain of SARS-CoV-2 S that potently inhibits infection by SARS-CoV-2. The lipopeptide inhibits cell-cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S and blocks infection by live SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cell monolayers more effectively than previously described lipopeptides. The SARS-CoV-2 lipopeptide exhibits broad-spectrum activity by inhibiting cell-cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and blocking infection by live MERS-CoV in cell monolayers. We also show that the SARS-CoV-2 HRC-derived lipopeptide potently blocks the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, an ",

        "Abstract": "Infection by human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) causes widespread lower respiratory diseases, including croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia, and there are no vaccines or effective treatments for these viruses. HPIV3 is a member of the Respirovirus species of the Paramyxoviridae family. These viruses are pleomorphic, enveloped viruses with genomes composed of single-stranded negative-sense RNA. During viral entry, the first step of infection, the viral fusion complex, comprised of the receptor-binding glycoprotein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion glycoprotein (F), mediates fusion upon receptor binding. The HPIV3 transmembrane protein HN, like the receptor-binding proteins of other related viruses that enter host cells using membrane fusion, binds to a receptor molecule on the host cell plasma membrane, which triggers the F glycoprotein to undergo major conformational rearrangements, promoting viral entry. Subsequent fusion of the viral and host membranes allows delivery of the viral genetic material into the host cell. The intermediate states in viral entry are transient and thermodynamically unstable, making it impossible to understand these transitions using standard methods, yet understanding these transition states is important for expanding our knowledge of the viral entry process. In this study, we use cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to dissect the stepwise process by which the receptor-binding protein triggers F-mediated fusion, when forming a complex with receptor-bearing membranes. Using an on-grid antibody capture method that facilitates examination of fresh, biologically active strains of virus directly from supernatant fluids and a series of biological tools that permit the capture of intermediate states in the fusion process, we visualize the series of events that occur when a pristine, authentic viral particle interacts with target receptors and proceeds from the viral entry steps of receptor engagement to membrane fusion.",

        "Title": "In vivo antiviral host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 by viral load, sex, and age.",
        "Abstract": "Despite limited genomic diversity, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown a wide range of clinical manifestations in different patient populations. The mechanisms behind these host differences are still unclear. Here, we examined host response gene expression across infection status, viral load, age, and sex among shotgun RNA sequencing profiles of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 430 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and 54 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 induced a strong antiviral response with up-regulation of antiviral factors such as OAS1-3 and IFIT1-3 and T helper type 1 (Th1) chemokines CXCL9/10/11, as well as a reduction in transcription of ribosomal proteins. SARS-CoV-2 culture in human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures replicated the in vivo antiviral host response 7 days post infection, with no induction of interferon-stimulated genes after 3 days. Patient-matched longitudinal specimens (mean elapsed time = 6.3 days) demonstrated reduction in interferon-induced transcription, recovery of transcription of ribosomal proteins, and initiation of wound healing and humoral immune responses. Expression of interferon-responsive genes, including ACE2, increased as a function of viral load, while transcripts for B cell-specific proteins and neutrophil chemokines were elevated in patients with lower viral load. Older individuals had reduced expression of the Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11 and their cognate receptor CXCR3, as well as CD8A and granzyme B, suggesting deficiencies in trafficking and/or function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Relative to females, males had reduced B cell-specific and NK cell-specific transcripts and an increase in inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) signaling, possibly inappropriately throttling antiviral responses. Collectively, our data demonstrate that host responses to SARS-CoV-2 are dependent on viral load and infection time course, with observed differences due to age and sex that may contribute to disease severity.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are associated with age. While children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) similar to Kawasaki's disease. Here, we show distinct antibody (Ab) responses in children with MIS-C compared to adults with severe COVID-19 causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and those who recovered from mild disease. There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in MIS-C patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for the Spike (S) protein but not for the nucleocapsid (N) protein, while both COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S IgG, IgM and IgA Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs. Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing activity compared to COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response. These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children and adults who develop severe disease, with implications for optimizing treatments based on symptom and age.",

        "Abstract": "Partial replacement of \u03b1-amino acid residues with \u03b2-amino acid residues has been established as a strategy for preserving target-engagement by helix-forming polypeptides while altering other properties. The impact of \u03b2-residue incorporation within polypeptides that adopt less regular conformations, however, has received less attention. The C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) domains of fusion glycoproteins from pathogenic paramyxoviruses contain a segment that must adopt an extended conformation in order to coassemble with the N-terminal heptad repeat (HRN) domain in the postfusion state and drive a merger of the viral envelope with a target cell membrane. Here, we examine the impact of single \u03b1-to-\u03b2 substitutions within this extended N-terminal segment of an engineered HRC peptide designated VIQKI. Stabilities of hexameric coassemblies formed with the native human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) HRN have been evaluated, the structures of five coassemblies have been determined, and antiviral efficacies have been measured. Many sites within the extended segment show functional tolerance of \u03b1-to-\u03b2 substitution. These results offer a basis for future development of paramyxovirus infection inhibitors with novel biological activity profiles, possibly including resistance to proteolysis.",

        "Abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging arbovirus, endemic in many parts of the world, that is spread by travelers and adapts to new mosquito vectors that live in temperate climates. CHIKV replicates in many host tissues and initially causes a self-limiting febrile illness similar to dengue. However, in 30%-40% of cases, CHIKV also causes long-term painful and debilitating muscle and joint pain, the pathogenesis of which remains unknown. In this issue of the JCI, Lentscher et al. engineered a skeletal muscle-restricted CHIKV to show that while musculoskeletal disease requires viral replication in affected muscle, muscular pathology is mediated by host immunological factors. These findings de-link viral replication and disease symptoms, illuminate the virus-host interplay in CHIKV symptomatology, and raise the possibility that immune modulation is a therapeutic option. The results also highlight possible solutions to existing vaccine barriers and provide insights that may apply to other viral diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are leading causes of lower respiratory tract infections. There are currently no vaccines or antiviral therapeutics to treat HPIV3 or RSV infections. We recently reported a peptide (VIQKI), derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) domain of the HPIV3 fusion (F) glycoprotein that inhibits infection by both HPIV3 and RSV. The dual inhibitory activity of VIQKI is due to its unique ability to bind to the N-terminal heptad repeat (HRN) domains of both HPIV3 and RSV F, thereby preventing the native HRN-HRC interactions required for viral entry. Here we describe the structure-guided design of dual inhibitors of HPIV3 and RSV fusion with improved efficacy. We show that VIQKI derivatives possessing one (I456F) or two (I454F/I456F) phenylalanine substitutions near the N-terminus exhibit more stable assemblies with the RSV-HRN domain and enhanced antiviral efficacy against both HPIV3 and RSV infection. Cocrystal structures of the new Phe-substituted inhibitors coassembled with HPIV3 or RSV-HRN domains reveal that the I456F substitution makes intimate hydrophobic contact with the core trimers of both HPIV3 and RSV F.",

        "Abstract": "Human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause lower respiratory infection in infants and young children. There are no vaccines for these pathogens, and existing treatments have limited or questionable efficacy. Infection by HPIV3 or RSV requires fusion of the viral and cell membranes, a process mediated by a trimeric fusion glycoprotein (F) displayed on the viral envelope. Once triggered, the pre-fusion form of F undergoes a series of conformational changes that first extend the molecule to allow for insertion of the hydrophobic fusion peptide into the target cell membrane and then refold the trimeric assembly into an energetically stable post-fusion state, a process that drives the merger of the viral and host cell membranes. Peptides derived from defined regions of HPIV3 F inhibit infection by HPIV3 by interfering with the structural transitions of the trimeric F assembly. Here we describe lipopeptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) domain of HPIV3 F that potently inhibit infection by both HPIV3 and RSV. The lead peptide inhibits RSV infection as effectively as does a peptide corresponding to the RSV HRC domain itself. We show that the inhibitors bind to the N-terminal heptad repeat (HRN) domains of both HPIV3 and RSV F with high affinity. Co-crystal structures of inhibitors bound to the HRN domains of HPIV3 or RSV F reveal remarkably different modes of binding in the N-terminal segment of the inhibitor.",

        "Abstract": "A clinical isolate of measles virus (MeV) bearing a single amino acid alteration in the viral fusion protein (F; L454W) was previously identified in two patients with lethal sequelae of MeV central nervous system (CNS) infection. The mutation dysregulated the viral fusion machinery so that the mutated F protein mediated cell fusion in the absence of known MeV cellular receptors. While this virus could feasibly have arisen via intrahost evolution of the wild-type (wt) virus, it was recently shown that the same mutation emerged under the selective pressure of small-molecule antiviral treatment. Under these conditions, a potentially neuropathogenic variant emerged outside the CNS. While CNS adaptation of MeV was thought to generate viruses that are less fit for interhost spread, we show that two animal models can be readily infected with CNS-adapted MeV via the respiratory route. Despite bearing a fusion protein that is less stable at 37\u00b0C than the wt MeV F, this virus infects and replicates in cotton rat lung tissue more efficiently than the wt virus and is lethal in a suckling mouse model of MeV encephalitis even with a lower inoculum. Thus, either during lethal MeV CNS infection or during antiviral treatment ",

        "Abstract": "During a measles virus (MeV) epidemic in 2009 in South Africa, measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) was identified in several HIV-infected patients. Years later, children are presenting with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). To investigate the features of established MeV neuronal infections, viral sequences were analyzed from brain tissue samples of a single SSPE case and compared with MIBE sequences previously obtained from patients infected during the same epidemic. Both the SSPE and the MIBE viruses had amino acid substitutions in the ectodomain of the F protein that confer enhanced fusion properties. Functional analysis of the fusion complexes confirmed that both MIBE and SSPE F protein mutations promoted fusion with less dependence on interaction by the viral receptor-binding protein with known MeV receptors. While the SSPE F required the presence of a homotypic attachment protein, MeV H, in order to fuse, MIBE F did not. Both F proteins had decreased thermal stability compared to that of the corresponding wild-type F protein. Finally, recombinant viruses expressing MIBE or SSPE fusion complexes spread in the absence of known MeV receptors, with MIBE F-bearing viruses causing large syncytia in these cells. Our results suggest that alterations to the MeV fusion complex that promote fusion and cell-to-cell spread in the absence of known MeV receptors is a key property for infection of the brain.",

        "Abstract": "Measles remains one of the leading causes of child mortality worldwide and is re-emerging in some countries due to poor vaccine coverage, concomitant with importation of measles virus (MV) from endemic areas. The lack of specific chemotherapy contributes to negative outcomes, especially in infants or immunodeficient individuals. Fusion inhibitor peptides derived from the MV Fusion protein C-terminal Heptad Repeat (HRC) targeting MV envelope fusion glycoproteins block infection at the stage of entry into host cells, thus preventing viral multiplication. To improve efficacy of such entry inhibitors, we have modified a HRC peptide inhibitor by introducing properties of self-assembly into nanoparticles (NP) and higher affinity for both viral and cell membranes. Modification of the peptide consisted of covalent grafting with tocopherol to increase amphipathicity and lipophilicity (HRC5). One additional peptide inhibitor consisting of a peptide dimer grafted to tocopherol was also used (HRC6). Spectroscopic, imaging, and simulation techniques were used to characterize the NP and explore the molecular basis for their antiviral efficacy. HRC5 forms micellar stable NP while HRC6 aggregates into amorphous, loose, unstable NP. Interpeptide cluster bridging governs NP assembly into dynamic metastable states. The results are consistent with the conclusion that the improved efficacy of HRC6 relative to HRC5 can be attributed to NP instability, which leads to more extensive partition to target membranes and binding to viral target proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Human parainfluenza viruses cause a large burden of human respiratory illness. While much research relies upon viruses grown in cultured immortalized cells, human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV-3) evolves in culture. Cultured viruses differ in their properties compared to clinical strains. We present a genome-wide survey of HPIV-3 adaptations to culture using metagenomic next-generation sequencing of matched pairs of clinical samples and primary culture isolates (zero passage virus). Nonsynonymous changes arose during primary viral isolation, almost entirely in the genes encoding the two surface glycoproteins-the receptor binding protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) or the fusion protein (F). We recovered genomes from 95 HPIV-3 primary culture isolates and 23 HPIV-3 strains directly from clinical samples. HN mutations arising during primary viral isolation resulted in substitutions at HN's dimerization/F-interaction site, a site critical for activation of viral fusion. Alterations in HN dimer interface residues known to favor infection in culture occurred within 4\u00a0days (H552 and N556). A novel cluster of residues at a different face of the HN dimer interface emerged (P241 and R242) and imply a role in HPIV-3-mediated fusion. Functional characterization of these culture-associated HN mutations in a clinical isolate background revealed acquisition of the fusogenic phenotype associated with cultured HPIV-3; the HN-F complex showed enhanced fusion and decreased receptor-cleaving activity. These results utilize a method for identifying genome-wide changes associated with brief adaptation to culture to highlight the notion that even brief exposure to immortalized cells may affect key viral properties and underscore the balance of features of the HN-F complex required for fitness by circulating viruses.",

        "Abstract": "Recapitulation of lung development from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in three dimensions (3D) would allow deeper insight into human development, as well as the development of innovative strategies for disease modelling, drug discovery and regenerative medicine. We report here the generation from hPSCs of lung bud organoids (LBOs) that contain mesoderm and pulmonary endoderm and develop into branching airway and early alveolar structures after xenotransplantation and in Matrigel 3D culture. Expression analysis and structural features indicated that the branching structures reached the second trimester of human gestation. Infection in vitro with respiratory syncytial virus, which causes small airway obstruction and bronchiolitis in infants, led to swelling, detachment and shedding of infected cells into the organoid lumens, similar to what has been observed in human lungs. Introduction of mutation in HPS1, which causes an early-onset form of intractable pulmonary fibrosis, led to accumulation of extracellular matrix and mesenchymal cells, suggesting the potential use of this model to recapitulate fibrotic lung disease in vitro. LBOs therefore recapitulate lung development and may provide a useful tool to model lung disease.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the interplay between molecules and lipid membranes is fundamental when studying cellular and biotechnological phenomena. Partition between aqueous media and lipid membranes is key to the mechanism of action of many biomolecules and drugs. Quantifying membrane partition, through adequate and robust parameters, is thus essential. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is a powerful technique for studying 1:1 stoichiometric interactions but has limited application to lipid membrane partition data. We have developed and applied a novel mathematical model for SPR data treatment that enables determination of kinetic and equilibrium partition constants. The method uses two complementary fitting models for association and dissociation sensorgram data. The SPR partition data obtained for the antibody fragment F63, the HIV fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide, and the endogenous drug kyotorphin towards POPC membranes were compared against data from independent techniques. The comprehensive kinetic and partition models were applied to the membrane interaction data of HRC4, a measles virus entry inhibitor peptide, revealing its increased affinity for, and retention in, cholesterol-rich membranes. Overall, our work extends the application of SPR beyond the realm of 1:1 stoichiometric ligand-receptor binding into a new and immense field of applications: the interaction of solutes such as biomolecules and drugs with lipids.",

        "Abstract": "Human paramyxoviruses include global causes of lower respiratory disease like the parainfluenza viruses, as well as agents of lethal encephalitis like Nipah virus. Infection is initiated by viral glycoprotein-mediated fusion between viral and host cell membranes. Paramyxovirus viral fusion proteins (F) insert into the target cell membrane, and form a transient intermediate that pulls the viral and cell membranes together as two heptad-repeat regions refold to form a six-helix bundle structure that can be specifically targeted by fusion-inhibitory peptides. Antiviral potency can be improved by sequence modification and lipid conjugation, and by adding linkers between the protein and lipid components. We exploit the uniquely broad spectrum antiviral activity of a parainfluenza F-derived peptide sequence that inhibits both parainfluenza and Nipah viruses, to investigate the influence of peptide orientation and intervening linker length on the peptides' interaction with transitional states of F, solubility, membrane insertion kinetics, and protease sensitivity. We assessed the impact of these features on biodistribution and antiviral efficacy in vitro and in vivo. The engineering approach based on biophysical parameters resulted in a peptide that is a highly effective inhibitor of both paramyxoviruses and a set of criteria to be used for engineering broad spectrum antivirals for emerging paramyxoviruses.",

        "Abstract": "Respiratory paramyxoviruses, including the highly prevalent human parainfluenza viruses, cause the majority of childhood croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia, yet there are currently no vaccines or effective treatments. Paramyxovirus research has relied on the study of laboratory-adapted strains of virus in immortalized cultured cell lines. We show that findings made in such systems about the receptor interaction and viral fusion requirements for entry and fitness-mediated by the receptor binding protein and the fusion protein-can be drastically different from the requirements for infection in vivo. Here we carried out whole-genome sequencing and genomic analysis of circulating human parainfluenza virus field strains to define functional and structural properties of proteins of circulating strains and to identify the genetic basis for properties that confer fitness in the field. The analysis of clinical strains suggests that the receptor binding-fusion molecule pairs of circulating viruses maintain a balance of properties that result in an inverse correlation between fusion in cultured cells and growth in vivo. Future analysis of entry mechanisms and inhibitory strategies for paramyxoviruses will benefit from considering the properties of viruses that are fit to infect humans, since a focus on viruses that have adapted to laboratory work provides a distinctly different picture of the requirements for the entry step of infection.",

        "Abstract": "In order to deliver their genetic material to host cells during infection, enveloped viruses use specialized proteins on their surfaces that bind cellular receptors and induce fusion of the viral and host membranes. In paramyxoviruses, a diverse family of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, including several important respiratory pathogens, such as parainfluenza viruses, the attachment and fusion machinery is composed of two separate proteins: a receptor binding protein (hemagglutinin-neuraminidase [HN]) and a fusion (F) protein that interact to effect membrane fusion. Here we used negative-stain and cryo-electron tomography to image the 3-dimensional ultrastructure of human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) virions in the absence of receptor engagement. We observed that HN exists in at least two organizations. The first were arrays of tetrameric HN that lacked closely associated F proteins: in these purely HN arrays, HN adopted a \"heads-down\" configuration. In addition, we observed regions of complex surface density that contained HN in an apparently extended \"heads-up\" form, colocalized with prefusion F trimers. This colocalization with prefusion F prior to receptor engagement supports a model for fusion in which HN in its heads-up state and F may interact prior to receptor engagement without activating F, and that interaction with HN in this configuration is not sufficient to activate F. Only upon receptor engagement by HN's globular head does HN transmit its activating signal to F.",

        "Abstract": "Paramyxoviruses, including the human pathogen measles virus (MV), enter host cells by fusing their viral envelope with the target cell membrane. This fusion process is driven by the concerted actions of the two viral envelope glycoproteins, the receptor binding protein (hemagglutinin [H]) and the fusion (F) protein. H attaches to specific proteinaceous receptors on host cells; once the receptor engages, H activates F to directly mediate lipid bilayer fusion during entry. In a recent MV outbreak in South Africa, several HIV-positive people died of MV central nervous system (CNS) infection. We analyzed the virus sequences from these patients and found that specific intrahost evolution of the F protein had occurred and resulted in viruses that are \"CNS adapted.\" A mutation in F of the CNS-adapted virus (a leucine-to-tryptophan change present at position 454) allows it to promote fusion with less dependence on engagement of H by the two known wild-type (wt) MV cellular receptors. This F protein is activated independently of H or the receptor and has reduced thermal stability and increased fusion activity compared to those of the corresponding wt F. These functional effects are the result of the single L454W mutation in F. We hypothesize that in the absence of effective cellular immunity, such as HIV infection, MV variants bearing altered fusion machinery that enabled efficient spread in the CNS underwent positive selection.",

No effective treatments are currently available for these viruses, and there is a need for efficient antiviral therapies. Paramyxoviruses enter the target cell by binding to a cell surface receptor and then fusing the viral envelope with the target cell membrane, allowing the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. Blockage of these crucial steps prevents infection and disease. Binding and fusion are driven by two virus-encoded glycoproteins, the receptor-binding protein and the fusion protein, that together form the viral \"fusion machinery.\" The development of efficient antiviral drugs requires a deeper understanding of the mechanism of action of the Paramyxoviridae fusion machinery, which is still controversial. Here, we review recent structural and functional data on these proteins and the current understanding of the mechanism of the paramyxovirus cell entry process.",

        "Abstract": "Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) cause widespread respiratory infections, with no vaccines or effective treatments. We show that the molecular determinants for HPIV3 growth in vitro are fundamentally different from those required in vivo and that these differences impact inhibitor susceptibility. HPIV infects its target cells by coordinated action of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase receptor-binding protein (HN) and the fusion envelope glycoprotein (F), which together comprise the molecular fusion machinery; upon receptor engagement by HN, the prefusion F undergoes a structural transition, extending and inserting into the target cell membrane and then refolding into a postfusion structure that fuses the viral and cell membranes. Peptides derived from key regions of F can potently inhibit HPIV infection at the entry stage, by interfering with the structural transition of F. We show that clinically circulating viruses have fusion machinery that is more stable and less readily activated than viruses adapted to growth in culture. Fusion machinery that is advantageous for growth in human airway epithelia and in vivo confers susceptibility to peptide fusion inhibitors in the host lung tissue or animal, but the same fusion inhibitors have no effect on viruses whose fusion glycoproteins are suited for growth in vitro. We propose that for potential clinical efficacy, antivirals should be evaluated using clinical isolates in natural host tissue rather than lab strains of virus in cultured cells. The unique susceptibility of clinical strains in human tissues reflects viral inhibition in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Paramyxoviruses, enveloped RNA viruses that include human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), cause the majority of childhood viral pneumonia. HPIV3 infection starts when the viral receptor-binding protein engages sialic acid receptors in the lung and the viral envelope fuses with the target cell membrane. Fusion/entry requires interaction between two viral surface glycoproteins: tetrameric hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion protein (F). In this report, we define structural correlates of the HN features that permit infection in vivo. We have shown that viruses with an HN-F that promotes growth in cultured immortalized cells are impaired in differentiated human airway epithelial cell cultures (HAE) and in vivo and evolve in HAE into viable viruses with less fusogenic HN-F. In this report, we identify specific structural features of the HN dimer interface that modulate HN-F interaction and fusion triggering and directly impact infection. Crystal structures of HN, which promotes viral growth in vivo, show a diminished interface in the HN dimer compared to the reference strain's HN, consistent with biochemical and biological data indicating decreased dimerization and decreased interaction with F protein. The crystallographic data suggest a structural explanation for the HN's altered ability to activate F and reveal properties that are critical for infection in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Paramyxoviruses, including the human pathogen measles virus (MV) and the avian Newcastle disease virus (NDV), enter host cells through fusion of the viral envelope with the target cell membrane. This fusion is driven by the concerted action of two viral envelope glycoproteins: the receptor binding protein and the fusion protein (F). The MV receptor binding protein (hemagglutinin [H]) attaches to proteinaceous receptors on host cells, while the receptor binding protein of NDV (hemagglutinin-neuraminidase [HN]) interacts with sialic acid-containing receptors. The receptor-bound HN/H triggers F to undergo conformational changes that render it competent to mediate fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The mechanism of fusion activation has been proposed to be different for sialic acid-binding viruses and proteinaceous receptor-binding viruses. We report that a chimeric protein containing the NDV HN receptor binding region and the MV H stalk domain can activate MV F to fuse, suggesting that the signal to the stalk of a protein-binding receptor binding molecule can be transmitted from a sialic acid binding domain. By engineering the NDV HN globular domain to interact with a proteinaceous receptor, the fusion activation signal was preserved. Our findings are consistent with a unified mechanism of fusion activation, at least for the Paramyxovirinae subfamily, in which the receptor binding domains of the receptor binding proteins are interchangeable and the stalk determines the specificity of F activation.",

        "Abstract": "Paramyxoviruses, including the emerging lethal human Nipah virus (NiV) and the avian Newcastle disease virus (NDV), enter host cells through fusion of the viral and target cell membranes. For paramyxoviruses, membrane fusion is the result of the concerted action of two viral envelope glycoproteins: a receptor binding protein and a fusion protein (F). The NiV receptor binding protein (G) attaches to ephrin B2 or B3 on host cells, whereas the corresponding hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) attachment protein of NDV interacts with sialic acid moieties on target cells through two regions of its globular domain. Receptor-bound G or HN via its stalk domain triggers F to undergo the conformational changes that render it competent to mediate fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. We show that chimeric proteins containing the NDV HN receptor binding regions and the NiV G stalk domain require a specific sequence at the connection between the head and the stalk to activate NiV F for fusion. Our findings are consistent with a general mechanism of paramyxovirus fusion activation in which the stalk domain of the receptor binding protein is responsible for F activation and a specific connecting region between the receptor binding globular head and the fusion-activating stalk domain is required for transmitting the fusion signal.",

        "Abstract": "The hemagglutinin (HA)-neuraminidase protein (HN) of paramyxoviruses carries out three discrete activities, each of which affects the ability of HN to promote viral fusion and entry: receptor binding, receptor cleaving (neuraminidase), and triggering of the fusion protein. Binding of HN to its sialic acid receptor on a target cell triggers its activation of the fusion protein (F), which then inserts into the target cell and mediates the membrane fusion that initiates infection. We provide new evidence for a fourth function of HN: stabilization of the F protein in its pretriggered state before activation. Influenza virus hemagglutinin protein (uncleaved HA) was used as a nonspecific binding protein to tether F-expressing cells to target cells, and heat was used to activate F, indicating that the prefusion state of F can be triggered to initiate structural rearrangement and fusion by temperature. HN expression along with uncleaved HA and F enhances the F activation if HN is permitted to engage the receptor. However, if HN is prevented from engaging the receptor by the use of a small compound, temperature-induced F activation is curtailed. The results indicate that HN helps stabilize the prefusion state of F, and analysis of a stalk domain mutant HN reveals that the stalk domain of HN mediates the F-stabilization effect.",

        "Title": "Adaptation of human parainfluenza virus to airway epithelium reveals fusion properties required for growth in host tissue.",
        "Abstract": "Paramyxoviruses, a family of RNA enveloped viruses that includes human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), cause the majority of childhood croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia worldwide. Infection starts with host cell receptor binding and fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane at the cell surface. The fusion process requires interaction of the two viral surface glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion protein (F). We have previously shown that viruses with an HN/F pair that is highly fusogenic in monolayers of immortalized cells due to mutations in HN's secondary sialic acid binding site are growth impaired in differentiated human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures and in vivo. Here we have shown that adaptation of HPIV3 to growth in the lung is determined by specific features of HN and F that are different from those required for growth in cultured immortalized cells. An HPIV3 virus bearing a mutated HN (H552Q), which is fit and fusogenic in immortalized cells but unfit for growth in the lung, evolved into a less-fusogenic but viable virus in differentiated human airway epithelium. Stepwise evolution led to a progressive decrease in efficiency of fusion activation by the HN/F pair, with a mutation in F first decreasing the activation of F by HN and a mutation in HN's secondary sialic acid binding site decreasing fusion activation further and producing a stable virus. Adaptation of HPIV3 to successful growth in HAE is determined by specific features of HN and F that lead to a less easily activated fusion mechanism.",

        "Title": "A general strategy to endow natural fusion-protein-derived peptides with potent antiviral activity.",
        "Abstract": "Fusion between the viral and target cell membranes is an obligatory step for the infectivity of all enveloped virus, and blocking this process is a clinically validated therapeutic strategy.Viral fusion is driven by specialized proteins which, although specific to each virus, act through a common mechanism, the formation of a complex between two heptad repeat (HR) regions. The HR regions are initially separated in an intermediate termed \"prehairpin\", which bridges the viral and cell membranes, and then fold onto each other to form a 6-helical bundle (6HB), driving the two membranes to fuse. HR-derived peptides can inhibit viral infectivity by binding to the prehairpin intermediate and preventing its transition to the 6HB.The antiviral activity of HR-derived peptides differs considerably among enveloped viruses. For weak inhibitors, potency can be increased by peptide engineering strategies, but sequence-specific optimization is time-consuming. In seeking ways to increase potency without changing the native sequence, we previously reported that attachment to the HR peptide of a cholesterol group (\"cholesterol-tagging\") dramatically increases its antiviral potency, and simultaneously increases its half-life in vivo. We show here that antiviral potency may be increased by combining cholesterol-tagging with dimerization of the HR-derived sequence, using as examples human parainfluenza virus, Nipah virus, and HIV-1. Together, cholesterol-tagging and dimerization may represent strategies to boost HR peptide potency to levels that in some cases may be compatible with in vivo use, possibly contributing to emergency responses to outbreaks of existing or novel viruses.",

        "Abstract": "The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein of paramyxoviruses carries out three distinct activities contributing to the ability of HN to promote viral fusion and entry: receptor binding, receptor cleavage (neuraminidase), and activation of the fusion protein. The relationship between receptor binding and fusion triggering functions of HN are not fully understood. For Newcastle disease virus (NDV), one bifunctional site (site I) on HN's globular head can mediate both receptor binding and neuraminidase activities, and a second site (site II) in the globular head is also capable of mediating receptor binding. The receptor analog, zanamivir, blocks receptor binding and cleavage activities of NDV HN's site I while activating receptor binding by site II. Comparison of chimeric proteins in which the globular head of NDV HN is connected to the stalk region of either human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) or Nipah virus receptor binding proteins indicates that receptor binding to NDV HN site II not only can activate its own fusion (F) protein but can also activate the heterotypic fusion proteins. We suggest a general model for paramyxovirus fusion activation in which receptor engagement at site II plays an active role in F activation.",

        "Abstract": "Emerging viruses including Nipah, Hendra, Lujo, and Junin viruses have enormous potential to spread rapidly. Nipah virus, after emerging as a zoonosis, has also evolved the capacity for human-to-human transmission. Most of the diseases caused by these pathogens are untreatable and require high biocontainment conditions. Universal methods for rapidly identifying and screening candidate antivirals are urgently needed. We have developed a modular antiviral platform strategy that relies on simple bioinformatic and genetic information about each pathogen. Central to this platform is the use of envelope glycoprotein cDNAs to establish multi-cycle replication systems under BSL2 conditions for viral pathogens that normally require BSL3 and BSL4 facilities. We generated monoclonal antibodies against Nipah G by cDNA immunization in rats, and we showed that these antibodies neutralize both Nipah and Hendra live viruses. We then used these effective Henipavirus inhibitors to validate our screening strategy. Our proposed strategy should contribute to the response capability for emerging infectious diseases, providing a way to initiate antiviral development immediately upon identifying novel viruses.",

        "Abstract": "Parainfluenza viruses enter host cells by fusing the viral and target cell membranes via concerted action of their two envelope glycoproteins: the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion protein (F). Receptor-bound HN triggers F to undergo conformational changes that render it fusion-competent. To address the role of receptor engagement and to elucidate how HN and F interact during the fusion process, we used bimolecular fluorescence complementation to follow the dynamics of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) HN/F pairs in living cells. We show that HN and F associate before receptor engagement. HN drives the formation of HN-F clusters at the site of fusion, and alterations in HN-F interaction determine the fusogenicity of the glycoprotein pair. An interactive site, at the HN dimer interface modulates HN fusion activation property, which is critical for infection of the natural host. This first evidence for the sequence of initial events that lead to viral entry may indicate a new paradigm for understanding Paramyxovirus infection.",

        "Abstract": "We previously described fusion-inhibitory peptides that are targeted to the cell membrane by cholesterol conjugation and potently inhibit enveloped viruses that fuse at the cell surface, including HIV, parainfluenza, and henipaviruses. However, for viruses that fuse inside of intracellular compartments, fusion-inhibitory peptides have exhibited very low antiviral activity. We propose that for these viruses, too, membrane targeting via cholesterol conjugation may yield potent compounds. Here we compare the activity of fusion-inhibitory peptides derived from the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and show that although the unconjugated peptides are inactive, the cholesterol-conjugated compounds are effective inhibitors of infectivity and membrane fusion. We hypothesize that the cholesterol moiety, by localizing the peptides to the target cell membrane, allows the peptides to follow the virus to the intracellular site of fusion. The cholesterol-conjugated peptides trap HA in a transient intermediate state after fusion is triggered but before completion of the refolding steps that drive the merging of the viral and cellular membranes. These results provide proof of concept for an antiviral strategy that is applicable to intracellularly fusing viruses, including known and emerging viral pathogens.",

        "Title": "Spring-loaded model revisited: paramyxovirus fusion requires engagement of a receptor binding protein beyond initial triggering of the fusion protein.",
        "Abstract": "During paramyxovirus entry into a host cell, receptor engagement by a specialized binding protein triggers conformational changes in the adjacent fusion protein (F), leading to fusion between the viral and cell membranes. According to the existing paradigm of paramyxovirus membrane fusion, the initial activation of F by the receptor binding protein sets off a spring-loaded mechanism whereby the F protein progresses independently through the subsequent steps in the fusion process, ending in membrane merger. For human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), the receptor binding protein (hemagglutinin-neuraminidase [HN]) has three functions: receptor binding, receptor cleaving, and activating F. We report that continuous receptor engagement by HN activates F to advance through the series of structural rearrangements required for fusion. In contrast to the prevailing model, the role of HN-receptor engagement in the fusion process is required beyond an initiating step, i.e., it is still required even after the insertion of the fusion peptide into the target cell membrane, enabling F to mediate membrane merger. We also report that for Nipah virus, whose receptor binding protein has no receptor-cleaving activity, the continuous stimulation of the F protein by a receptor-engaged binding protein is key for fusion. We suggest a general model for paramyxovirus fusion activation in which receptor engagement plays an active role in F activation, and the continued engagement of the receptor binding protein is essential to F protein function until the onset of membrane merger. This model has broad implications for the mechanism of paramyxovirus fusion and for strategies to prevent viral entry.",

        "Abstract": "Paramyxoviruses, including the childhood pathogen human parainfluenza virus type 3, enter host cells by fusion of the viral and target cell membranes. This fusion results from the concerted action of its two envelope glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion protein (F). The receptor-bound HN triggers F to undergo conformational changes that render it competent to mediate fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. We proposed that, if the fusion process could be activated prematurely before the virion reaches the target host cell, infection could be prevented. We identified a small molecule that inhibits paramyxovirus entry into target cells and prevents infection. We show here that this compound works by an interaction with HN that results in F-activation prior to receptor binding. The fusion process is thereby prematurely activated, preventing fusion of the viral membrane with target cells and precluding viral entry. This first evidence that activation of a paramyxovirus F can be specifically induced before the virus contacts its target cell suggests a new strategy with broad implications for the design of antiviral agents.",

In the new approach, artificial cell-like particles (protocells) presenting membrane receptors in a biomimetic manner were developed and found to attract and inactivate henipavirus envelope glycoprotein pseudovirus particles, preventing infection. The protocells do not accumulate virus during the inactivation process. The use of protocells that interact with, but do not accumulate, viruses may provide significant advantages over current antiviral drugs, and this general approach may have wide potential for antiviral development.",

        "Abstract": "In the paramyxovirus cell entry process, receptor binding triggers conformational changes in the fusion protein (F) leading to viral and cellular membrane fusion. Peptides derived from C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) regions in F have been shown to inhibit fusion by preventing formation of the fusogenic six-helix bundle. We recently showed that the addition of a cholesterol group to HRC peptides active against Nipah virus targets these peptides to the membrane where fusion occurs, dramatically increasing their antiviral effect. In this work, we report that unlike the untagged HRC peptides, which bind to the postulated extended intermediate state bridging the viral and cell membranes, the cholesterol tagged HRC-derived peptides interact with F before the fusion peptide inserts into the target cell membrane, thus capturing an earlier stage in the F-activation process. Furthermore, we show that cholesterol tagging renders these peptides active in vivo: the cholesterol-tagged peptides cross the blood brain barrier, and effectively prevent and treat in an established animal model what would otherwise be fatal Nipah virus encephalitis. The in vivo efficacy of cholesterol-tagged peptides, and in particular their ability to penetrate the CNS, suggests that they are promising candidates for the prevention or therapy of infection by Nipah and other lethal paramyxoviruses.",

DAS181, a recombinant sialidase protein containing the catalytic domain of Actinomyces viscosus sialidase, removes cell surface sialic acid, and we proposed that it would inhibit HPIV infection.",

        "Title": "Viral entry inhibitors targeted to the membrane site of action.",
        "Abstract": "The fusion of enveloped viruses with the host cell is driven by specialized fusion proteins to initiate infection. The \"class I\" fusion proteins harbor two regions, typically two heptad repeat (HR) domains, which are central to the complex conformational changes leading to fusion: the first heptad repeat (HRN) is adjacent to the fusion peptide, while the second (HRC) immediately precedes the transmembrane domain. Peptides derived from the HR regions can inhibit fusion, and one HR peptide, T20 (enfuvirtide), is in clinical use for HIV-1. For paramyxoviruses, the activities of two membrane proteins, the receptor-binding protein (hemagglutinin-neuraminidase [HN] or G) and the fusion protein (F), initiate viral entry. The binding of HN or G to its receptor on a target cell triggers the activation of F, which then inserts into the target cell and mediates the membrane fusion that initiates infection. We have shown that for paramyxoviruses, the inhibitory efficacy of HR peptides is inversely proportional to the rate of F activation. For HIV-1, the antiviral potency of an HRC-derived peptide can be dramatically increased by targeting it to the membrane microdomains where fusion occurs, via the addition of a cholesterol group. We report here that for three paramyxoviruses-human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), a major cause of lower respiratory tract diseases in infants, and the emerging zoonotic viruses Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV), which cause lethal central nervous system diseases-the addition of cholesterol to a paramyxovirus HRC-derived peptide increased antiviral potency by 2 log units. Our data suggest that this enhanced activity is indeed the result of the targeting of the peptide to the plasma membrane, where fusion occurs. The cholesterol-tagged peptides on the cell surface create a protective antiviral shield, target the F protein directly at its site of action, and expand the potential utility of inhibitory peptides for paramyxoviruses.",

        "Abstract": "We describe an antiviral small molecule, LJ001, effective against numerous enveloped viruses including Influenza A, filoviruses, poxviruses, arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, paramyxoviruses, flaviviruses, and HIV-1. In sharp contrast, the compound had no effect on the infection of nonenveloped viruses. In vitro and in vivo assays showed no overt toxicity. LJ001 specifically intercalated into viral membranes, irreversibly inactivated virions while leaving functionally intact envelope proteins, and inhibited viral entry at a step after virus binding but before virus-cell fusion. LJ001 pretreatment also prevented virus-induced mortality from Ebola and Rift Valley fever viruses. Structure-activity relationship analyses of LJ001, a rhodanine derivative, implicated both the polar and nonpolar ends of LJ001 in its antiviral activity. LJ001 specifically inhibited virus-cell but not cell-cell fusion, and further studies with lipid biosynthesis inhibitors indicated that LJ001 exploits the therapeutic window that exists between static viral membranes and biogenic cellular membranes with reparative capacity. In sum, our data reveal a class of broad-spectrum antivirals effective against enveloped viruses that target the viral lipid membrane and compromises its ability to mediate virus-cell fusion.",

For human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), the effects of specific mutations that alter these functions of the receptor-binding protein have been well characterized using cultured monolayer cells, which have identified steps that are potentially relevant to pathogenesis. In the present study, proposed mechanisms that are relevant to pathogenesis were tested in natural host cell cultures, a model of the human airway epithelium (HAE) in which primary HAE cells are cultured at an air-liquid interface and retain functional properties. Infection of HAE cells with wild-type HPIV3 and variant viruses closely reflects that seen in an animal model, the cotton rat, suggesting that HAE cells provide an ideal system for assessing the interplay of host cell and viral factors in pathogenesis and for screening for inhibitory molecules that would be effective in vivo. Both HN's receptor avidity and the function and timing of F activation by HN require a critical balance for the establishment of ongoing infection in the HAE, and these HN functions independently modulate the production of active virions. Alterations in HN's F-triggering function lead to the release of noninfectious viral particles and a failure of the virus to spread. The finding that the dysregulation of F triggering prohibits successful infection in HAE cells suggests that antiviral strategies targeted to HN's F-triggering activity may have promise in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Peptides derived from conserved heptad repeat (HR) regions of paramyxovirus fusion (F) proteins inhibit viral fusion by interfering with the formation of the fusogenic six-helix bundle structure. Peptide efficacy is affected by the strength of the peptide association with the target virus's complementary HR region. Here, we show that a second basis for peptide efficacy lies in the kinetics of F activation by the homotypic attachment protein: efficient F activation by the attachment protein shortens the period during which antiviral molecules targeting intermediate states of F may act, thereby modulating the effectiveness of inhibitory peptides. These results highlight new issues to be considered in developing strategies for fusion inhibitors.",

        "Title": "Simulating henipavirus multicycle replication in a screening assay leads to identification of a promising candidate for therapy.",
        "Abstract": "Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses are emerging zoonotic paramyxoviruses that cause encephalitis in humans, with fatality rates of up to 75%. We designed a new high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for inhibitors of infection based on envelope glycoprotein pseudotypes. The assay simulates multicycle replication and thus identifies inhibitors that target several stages of the viral life cycle, but it still can be carried out under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions. These features permit a screen for antivirals for emerging viruses and select agents that otherwise would require BSL-4 HTS facilities. The screening of a small compound library identified several effective molecules, including the well-known compound chloroquine, as highly active inhibitors of pseudotyped virus infection. Chloroquine inhibited infection with live HeV and NiV at a concentration of 1 microM in vitro (50% inhibitory concentration, 2 microM), which is less than the plasma concentrations present in humans receiving chloroquine treatment for malaria. The mechanism for chloroquine's antiviral action likely is the inhibition of cathepsin L, a cellular enzyme that is essential for the processing of the viral fusion glycoprotein and the maturation of newly budding virions. Without this processing step, virions are not infectious. The identification of a compound that inhibits a known cellular target that is important for viral maturation but that had not previously been shown to have antiviral activity for henipaviruses highlights the validity of this new screening assay. Given the established safety profile and broad experience with chloroquine in humans, the results described here provide an option for treating individuals infected by these deadly viruses.",

        "Abstract": "There are currently no antiviral drugs approved for the highly lethal Biosafety Level 4 pathogens Nipah and Hendra virus. A number of researchers are developing surrogate assays amenable to Biosafety Level 2 biocontainment but ultimately, the development of a high throughput screening method for directly quantifying these viruses in a Biosafety Level 4 environment will be critical for final evaluation of antiviral drugs identified in surrogate assays, in addition to reducing the time required for effective antiviral drug development. By adapting an existing immunoplaque assay and using enzyme linked immunodetection in a microtitre plate format, the current experiments describe a simple two step assay protocol involving an overnight virus inoculation of Vero cell monolayers (with or without antiviral drug treatment) at Biosafety Level 4, followed by cell fixation and virus inactivation enabling removal of plates from the Biosafety Level 4 laboratory and a subsequent immunodetection assay using a chemiluminescent horse radish peroxidase substrate to be performed at Biosafety Level 2. The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection) of this assay is 100 tissue culture infectious dose50/ml of either Nipah or Hendra virus. In addition this assay enables linear quantitation of virus over three orders of magnitude and is unaffected by dimethyl sulfoxide concentrations of 1% or less. Intra-assay coefficients of variation are acceptable (less than 20%) when detecting a minimum of 1000 tissue culture infectious dose50/ml of either virus although inter-assay variation is considerably greater. By an assessment of efficacies of the broad spectrum antiviral Ribavirin and an experimental fusion inhibitory peptide, this assay reveals a good correlation with previously published fluorescent immunodetection assays. The current experiments describe for the first time, a high throughput screening method amenable for direct assessment of live henipavirus antiviral drug activity.",

        "Abstract": "Antiviral drugs are important in the management of seasonal influenza and critical to pandemic planning. Although several other classes of anti-influenza compounds exist, the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors are currently the only option in most clinical settings. These drugs, zanamivir and oseltamivir, prevent the release of newly replicated influenza virions from infected cells. They are highly effective when used for treatment of seasonal influenza early in the course of infection, or for prevention when given soon after exposure. Treatment strategies for avian influenza infections in humans are still provisional owing to inadequate clinical data. As predicted by molecular studies, resistance to the NA inhibitors is now emerging, although at a level less significant than adamantane resistance. NA inhibitor resistance is a cause for concern if indeed some mutant strains of avian influenza are transmissible and pathogenic. In the near term, appropriate use of the available NA inhibitors will be of major benefit in lessening morbidity and mortality due to influenza infection. Priorities include developing appropriate formulations and guidelines for use of these drugs in children and people infected with avian influenza, study of the mechanisms and clinical significance of drug resistance, and identification of new antiviral therapies that target different points in the viral life cycle in order to limit the effect of emerging drug resistance.",

        "Abstract": "Paramyxoviruses, including the childhood respiratory pathogen human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), possess an envelope protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) that has receptor-cleaving (neuraminidase), as well as receptor-binding, activity. HN is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, present on the surface of the virus as a tetramer composed of two dimers. HN is also essential for activating the fusion protein (F) to mediate merger of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. This initial step of viral entry occurs at the host cell surface at neutral pH. The HN molecule carries out these three different critical activities at specific points in the process of viral entry, and understanding the regulation of these activities is key for the design of strategies that block infection. One bifunctional site (site I) on the HN of HPIV3 possesses both receptor binding and neuraminidase activities, and we recently obtained experimental evidence for a second receptor binding site (site II) on HPIV3 HN. Mutation of HN at specific residues at this site, which is next to the HN dimer interface, confers enhanced fusion properties, without affecting neuraminidase activity or receptor binding at neutral pH. We now demonstrate that mutations at this site II, as well as at site I, confer pH dependence on HN's receptor avidity. These mutations permit pH to modulate the binding and fusion processes of the virus, potentially providing regulation at specific stages of the viral life cycle.",

        "Abstract": "The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein of paramyxoviruses carries out three discrete activities that each affect the ability of HN to promote viral fusion and entry: receptor binding, receptor cleaving (neuraminidase), and triggering of the fusion protein. The interrelationship between the receptor binding and fusion-triggering functions of HN has not been clear. For human parainfluenza type 3 (HPIV3), one bifunctional site on HN can carry out both receptor binding and neuraminidase activities, and this site's receptor binding can be inhibited by the small receptor analog zanamivir. We now report experimental evidence, complemented by computational data, for a second receptor binding site near the HPIV3 HN dimer interface. This second binding site can mediate receptor binding even in the presence of zanamivir, and it differs from the second receptor binding site of the paramyxovirus Newcastle disease virus in its function and its relationship to the primary binding site. This second binding site of HPIV3 HN is involved in triggering F. We suggest that the two receptor binding sites on HPIV3 HN each contribute in distinct ways to virus-cell interaction; one is the multifunctional site that contains both binding and neuraminidase activities, and the other contains binding activity and also is involved in fusion promotion.",

Influenza virus also causes a significant burden of disease in young children, although its significance in children was not fully recognized until recently. This article discusses pathogens that have been studied for several decades, including RSV and HPIVs, and also explores the newly identified viral pathogens HMPV and human coronavirus NL63. The escalating rate of emergence of new infectious agents, fortunately meeting with equally rapid advancements in molecular methods of surveillance and pathogen discovery, means that new organisms will soon be added to the list. A section on therapies for bronchiolitis addresses the final common pathways that can result from infection with diverse pathogens, highlighting the mechanisms that may be amenable to therapeutic approaches. The article concludes with a discussion of the overarching impact of new diagnostic strategies.",

These three discrete properties each affect the ability of HN to promote viral fusion and entry. For human parainfluenza type 3, one bifunctional site on HN can carry out both binding and neuraminidase, and the receptor mimic, zanamivir, impairs viral entry by blocking receptor binding. We report here that for Newcastle disease virus, the HN receptor avidity is increased by zanamivir, due to activation of a second site that has higher receptor avidity. Only certain receptor mimics effectively activate the second site (site II) via occupation of site I; yet without activation of this second site, binding is mediated entirely by site I. Computational modeling designed to complement the experimental approaches suggests that the potential for small molecule receptor mimics to activate site II, upon binding to site I, directly correlates with their predicted strengths of interaction with site I. Taken together, the experimental and computational data show that the molecules with the strongest interactions with site I-zanamivir and BCX 2798-lead to the activation of site II. The finding that site II, once activated, shows higher avidity for receptor than site I, suggests paradigms for further elucidating the regulation of HN's multiple functions in the viral life cycle.",

        "Abstract": "Human parainfluenza viruses cause several serious respiratory diseases in children for which there is no effective prevention or therapy. Parainfluenza viruses initiate infection by binding to cell surface receptors and then, via coordinated action of the 2 viral surface glycoproteins, fuse directly with the cell membrane to release the viral replication machinery into the host cell's cytoplasm. During this process, the receptor-binding molecule must trigger the viral fusion protein to mediate fusion and entry of the virus into a cell. This review explores the binding and entry into cells of parainfluenza virus type 3, focusing on how the receptor-binding molecule triggers the fusion process. There are several steps during the process of binding, triggering, and fusion that are now understood at the molecular level, and each of these steps represents potential targets for interrupting infection.",

        "Abstract": "In order to examine functions of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein that quantitatively influence fusion promotion, human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) variants with alterations in HN were studied. The variant HNs have mutations that affect either receptor binding avidity, neuraminidase activity, or fusion protein (F) activation. Neuraminidase activity was regulated by manipulation of temperature and pH. F activation was assessed by quantitating the irreversible binding of target erythrocytes (RBC) to HN/F-coexpressing cells in the presence of 4-GU-DANA (zanamivir) to release target cells bound only by HN-receptor interactions; the remaining, irreversibly bound target cells are retained via the fusion protein. In cells coexpressing wild-type (wt) or variant HNs with wt F, the fusion promotion capacity of HN was distinguished from target cell binding by measuring changes with time in the amounts of target RBC that were (i) reversibly bound by HN-receptor interaction (released only upon the addition of 4-GU-DANA), (ii) released by HN's neuraminidase, and (iii) irreversibly bound by F-insertion or fusion (F triggered). For wt HN, lowering the pH (to approach the optimum for HPIV3 neuraminidase) decreased F triggering via release of HN from its receptor. An HN variant with increased receptor binding avidity had F-triggering efficiency like that of wt HN at pH 8.0, but this efficiency was not decreased by lowering the pH to 5.7, which suggested that the variant HN's higher receptor binding activity counterbalanced the receptor dissociation promoted by increased neuraminidase activity. To dissect the specific contribution of neuraminidase to triggering, two variant HNs that are triggering-defective due to a mutation in the HN stalk were evaluated. One of these variants has, in addition, a mutation in the globular head that renders it neuraminidase dead, while the HN with the stalk mutation alone has 30% of wt neuraminidase. While the variant without neuraminidase activity triggered F effectively at 37 degrees C irrespective of pH, the variant possessing effective neuraminidase activity completely failed to activate F at pH 5.7 and was capable of only minimal triggering activity even at pH 8.0. These results demonstrate that neuraminidase activity impacts the extent of HPIV3-mediated fusion by releasing HN from contact with receptor. Any particular HN's competence to promote F-mediated fusion depends on the balance between its inherent F-triggering efficacy and its receptor-attachment regulatory functions (binding and receptor cleavage).",

        "Title": "Inhibition of parainfluenza virus type 3 and Newcastle disease virus hemagglutinin-neuraminidase receptor binding: effect of receptor avidity and steric hindrance at the inhibitor binding sites.",
        "Abstract": "Zanamivir (4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en [4-GU-DANA]) inhibits not only the neuraminidase activity but also the receptor interaction of the human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), blocking receptor binding and subsequent fusion promotion. All activities of the HPIV3 variant ZM1 HN (T193I/I567V) are less sensitive to 4-GU-DANA's effects. The T193I mutation in HN confers both increased receptor binding and increased neuraminidase activity, as well as reduced sensitivities of both activities to 4-GU-DANA inhibition, consistent with a single site on the HN molecule carrying out both catalysis and binding. We now provide evidence that the HPIV3 variant's resistance to receptor-binding inhibition by 4-GU-DANA is related to a reduced affinity of the HN receptor-binding site for this compound as well as to an increase in the avidity of HN for the receptor. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) HN and HPIV3 HN respond differently to inhibition in ways that suggest a fundamental distinction between them. NDV HN-receptor binding is less sensitive than HPIV3 HN-receptor binding to 4-GU-DANA, while its neuraminidase activity is highly sensitive. Both HPIV3 and NDV HNs are sensitive to receptor-binding inhibition by the smaller molecule DANA. However, for NDV HN, some receptor binding cannot be inhibited. These data are consistent with the presence in NDV HN of a second receptor-binding site that is devoid of enzyme activity and has a negligible, if any, affinity for 4-GU-DANA. Avidity for the receptor contributes to resistance by allowing the receptor to compete effectively with inhibitors for interaction with HN, while the further determinant of resistance is the reduced binding of the inhibitor molecule to the binding pocket on HN. Based upon our data and recent three-dimensional structural information on the HPIV3 and NDV HNs, we propose mechanisms for the observed sensitivity and resistance of HN to receptor-binding inhibition and discuss the implications of these mechanisms for the distribution of HN functions.",

        "Title": "Triggering of human parainfluenza virus 3 fusion protein (F) by the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein: an HN mutation diminishes the rate of F activation and fusion.",
        "Abstract": "For human parainfluenza virus type 3 and many other paramyxoviruses, membrane fusion mediated by the fusion protein (F) has a stringent requirement for the presence of the homotypic hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN). With the goal of gaining further insight into the role of HN in the fusion process, we developed a simple method for quantitative comparison of the ability of wild-type and variant HNs to activate F. In this method, HN/F-coexpressing cells with red blood cells (RBC) bound to them at 4 degrees C are transferred to 22 degrees C, and at different times after transfer 4-guanidino-neu5Ac2en (4-GU-DANA) is added; this inhibitor of the HN-receptor interaction then releases all reversibly bound RBC but not those in which F insertion in the target membrane or fusion has occurred. Thus, the amount of irreversibly bound (nonreleased) RBC provides a measure of F activation, and the use of fluorescently labeled RBC permits microscopic assessment of the extent to which F insertion has progressed to fusion. We studied two neuraminidase-deficient HN variants, C28a, which has two mutations, P111S and D216N, and C28, which possesses the D216N mutation only. C28a but not C28 exhibits a slow fusion phenotype, although determination of the HNs' receptor-binding avidity (with our sensitive method, employing RBC with different degrees of receptor depletion) showed that the receptor-binding avidity of C28a or C28 HN was not lower than that of the wild type. The F activation assay, however, revealed fusion-triggering defects in C28a HN. After 10 and also 20 min at 22 degrees C, irreversible RBC binding was significantly less for cells coexpressing wild-type F with C28a HN than for cells coexpressing wild-type F with wild-type HN. In addition, F insertion progressed to fusion more slowly in the case of C28a HN-expressing cells than of wild-type HN-expressing cells. Identical defects were found for P111S HN, whereas for C28 HN, representing the 216 mutation of C28a, F activation and fusion were as rapid as for wild-type HN. The diminished fusion promotion capacity of C28a HN is therefore attributable to P111S, a mutation in the stalk region of the molecule that causes no decrease in receptor-binding avidity. C28a HN is the first parainfluenza virus variant found so far to be specifically defective in HN's F-triggering and fusion promotion functions and may contribute to our understanding of transmission of the activating signal from HN to F.",

        "Title": "Mutations in human parainfluenza virus type 3 hemagglutinin-neuraminidase causing increased receptor binding activity and resistance to the transition state sialic acid analog 4-GU-DANA (Zanamivir).",
        "Abstract": "Entry and fusion of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPF3) require the interaction of the viral hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein with its sialic acid receptor. 4-GU-DANA, a potent inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase, inhibits not only HPF3 neuraminidase but also the receptor binding activity of HPF3 HN and thus its ability to promote attachment and fusion. We previously generated a 4-GU-DANA-resistant HPF3 virus variant (ZM1) with a markedly fusogenic plaque morphology that harbored two HN gene mutations resulting in amino acid alterations. The present study using cells that express the individual mutations of ZM1 HN shows that one of these mutations is responsible for the increases in receptor binding and neuraminidase activities as well as the diminished sensitivity of both activities to the inhibitory effect of 4-GU-DANA. To examine the hypothesis that increased receptor binding avidity underlies 4-GU-DANA resistance, parallel studies were carried out on the high-affinity HN variant virus C22 and cells expressing the C22 variant HN. This variant also exhibited reduced sensitivity to 4-GU-DANA in terms of receptor binding and infectivity but without concomitant changes in the neuraminidase activity of HN. Another high-affinity HN variant, C0, was not resistant in terms of infectivity; however, a small increase in the receptor binding activity of C0 HN and a partial resistance of this activity to 4-GU-DANA were revealed by sensitive methods that we developed. In each virus variant, one mutation in HN accounted for both increased receptor binding avidity and 4-GU-DANA resistance; the higher affinity for the receptor overcomes the inhibitory effect of 4-GU-DANA. Thus, in contrast to influenza viruses for which 4-GU-DANA escape variants include hemagglutinin mutants with decreased receptor binding avidity that promotes virion release, for HPF3, HN mutants with increased receptor binding avidity are those that can escape the growth inhibitory effect of 4-GU-DANA.",
