        "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) that promotes resistance to immunotherapy. A preclinical model system that facilitates studies of the TIME and its impact on the responsiveness of human PDAC to immunotherapies remains an unmet need. We report a novel mouse model, which develops metastatic human PDAC that becomes infiltrated by human immune cells recapitulating the TIME of human PDAC. The model may serve as a versatile platform to study the nature of human PDAC TIME and its response to various treatments.",

        "Abstract": "The blockade of immune checkpoints by anti-receptor and/or anti-ligand mAb is one of the most promising approaches to cancer immunotherapy. The interaction between Ig-like transcript 3 (ILT3), a marker of tolerogenic dendritic cells, also known as LILRB4/LIR5/CD85k, and its still unidentified ligand on the surface of activated human T cells is potentially important for immune checkpoint blockade. To identify the ILT3 ligand, we generated mAb by immunizing mice with Jurkat acute T cell leukemia, which binds ILT3.Fc to its membrane. Flow cytometry, mass spectrometry, and Biacore studies demonstrated that the ILT3 ligand is a CD166/activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule. Knockdown of CD166 in primary human T cells by nucleofection abolished the capacity of ILT3.Fc to inhibit CD4",
