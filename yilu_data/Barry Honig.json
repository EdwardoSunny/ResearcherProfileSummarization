        "Abstract": "Computational free energy-based methods have the potential to significantly improve throughput and decrease costs of protein design efforts. Such methods must reach a high level of reliability, accuracy, and automation to be effectively deployed in practical industrial settings in a way that impacts protein design projects. Here, we present a benchmark study for the calculation of relative changes in protein-protein binding affinity for single point mutations across a variety of systems from the literature, using free energy perturbation (FEP+) calculations. We describe a method for robust treatment of alternate protonation states for titratable amino acids, which yields improved correlation with and reduced error compared to experimental binding free energies. Following careful analysis of the largest outlier cases in our dataset, we assess limitations of the default FEP+ protocols and introduce an automated script which identifies probable outlier cases that may require additional scrutiny and calculates an empirical correction for a subset of charge-related outliers. Through a series of three additional case study systems, we discuss how Protein FEP+ can be applied to real-world protein design projects, and suggest areas of further study.",

        "Abstract": "We introduce ZEPPI (Z-score Evaluation of Protein-Protein Interfaces), a framework to evaluate structural models of a complex based on sequence coevolution and conservation involving residues in protein-protein interfaces. The ZEPPI score is calculated by comparing metrics for an interface to those obtained from randomly chosen residues. Since contacting residues are defined by the structural model, this obviates the need to account for indirect interactions. Further, although ZEPPI relies on species-paired multiple sequence alignments, its focus on interfacial residues allows it to leverage quite shallow alignments. ZEPPI can be implemented on a proteome-wide scale and is applied here to millions of structural models of dimeric complexes in the ",

Yet, adaptive resistance mechanisms, induced by rapid, context-specific signaling network rewiring, continue to challenge therapeutic efficacy. Leveraging progress in proteomic technologies and network-based methodologies, we introduce Virtual Enrichment-based Signaling Protein-activity Analysis (VESPA)-an algorithm designed to elucidate mechanisms of cell response and adaptation to drug perturbations-and use it to analyze 7-point phosphoproteomic time series from colorectal cancer cells treated with clinically-relevant inhibitors and control media. Interrogating tumor-specific enzyme/substrate interactions accurately infers kinase and phosphatase activity, based on their substrate phosphorylation state, effectively accounting for signal crosstalk and sparse phosphoproteome coverage. The analysis elucidates time-dependent signaling pathway response to each drug perturbation and, more importantly, cell adaptive response and rewiring, experimentally confirmed by CRISPR knock-out assays, suggesting broad applicability to cancer and other diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Computational free energy-based methods have the potential to significantly improve throughput and decrease costs of protein design efforts. Such methods must reach a high level of reliability, accuracy, and automation to be effectively deployed in practical industrial settings in a way that impacts protein design projects. Here, we present a benchmark study for the calculation of relative changes in protein-protein binding affinity for single point mutations across a variety of systems from the literature, using free energy perturbation (FEP+) calculations. We describe a method for robust treatment of alternate protonation states for titratable amino acids, which yields improved correlation with and reduced error compared to experimental binding free energies. Following careful analysis of the largest outlier cases in our dataset, we assess limitations of the default FEP+ protocols and introduce an automated script which identifies probable outlier cases that may require additional scrutiny and calculates an empirical correction for a subset of charge-related outliers. Through a series of three additional case study systems, we discuss how protein FEP+ can be applied to real-world protein design projects, and suggest areas of further study.",

        "Abstract": "Self-recognition is a fundamental cellular process across evolution and forms the basis of neuronal self-avoidance1-4. Clustered protocadherins (Pcdh), comprising a large family of isoform-specific homophilic recognition molecules, play a pivotal role in neuronal self-avoidance required for mammalian brain development5-7. The probabilistic expression of different Pcdh isoforms confers unique identities upon neurons and forms the basis for neuronal processes to discriminate between self and non-self5,6,8. Whether this self-recognition mechanism exists in astrocytes, the other predominant cell type of the brain, remains unknown. Here, we report that a specific isoform in the Pcdh\u03b3 cluster, \u03b3C3, is highly enriched in human and murine astrocytes. Through genetic manipulation, we demonstrate that \u03b3C3 acts autonomously to regulate astrocyte morphogenesis in the mouse visual cortex. To determine if \u03b3C3 proteins act by promoting recognition between processes of the same astrocyte, we generated pairs of \u03b3C3 chimeric proteins capable of heterophilic binding to each other, but incapable of homophilic binding. Co-expressing complementary heterophilic binding isoform pairs in the same \u03b3C3 null astrocyte restored normal morphology. By contrast, chimeric \u03b3C3 proteins individually expressed in single \u03b3C3 null mutant astrocytes did not. These data establish that self-recognition is essential for astrocyte development in the mammalian brain and that, by contrast to neuronal self-recognition, a single Pcdh isoform is both necessary and sufficient for this process.",

        "Abstract": "We introduce ZEPPI (Z-score Evaluation of Protein-Protein Interfaces), a framework to evaluate structural models of a complex based on sequence co-evolution and conservation involving residues in protein-protein interfaces. The ZEPPI score is calculated by comparing metrics for an interface to those obtained from randomly chosen residues. Since contacting residues are defined by the structural model, this obviates the need to account for indirect interactions. Further, although ZEPPI relies on species-paired multiple sequence alignments, its focus on interfacial residues allows it to leverage quite shallow alignments. ZEPPI performance is evaluated through applications to experimentally determined complexes and to decoys from the CASP-CAPRI experiment. ZEPPI can be implemented on a proteome-wide scale as evidenced by calculations on millions of structural models of dimeric complexes in the ",

        "Title": "Push-pull mechanics of E-cadherin ectodomains in biomimetic adhesions.",
        "Abstract": "E-cadherin plays a central role in cell-cell adhesion. The ectodomains of wild-type cadherins form a crystalline-like two-dimensional lattice in cell-cell interfaces mediated by both trans (apposed cell) and cis (same cell) interactions. In addition to these extracellular forces, adhesive strength is further regulated by cytosolic phenomena involving \u03b1 and \u03b2 catenin-mediated interactions between cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton. Cell-cell adhesion can be further strengthened under tension through mechanisms that have not been definitively characterized in molecular detail. Here we quantitatively determine the role of the cadherin ectodomain in mechanosensing. To this end, we devise an E-cadherin-coated emulsion system, in which droplet surface tension is balanced by protein binding strength to give rise to stable areas of adhesion. To reach the honeycomb/cohesive limit, an initial emulsion compression by centrifugation facilitates E-cadherin trans binding, whereas a high protein surface concentration enables the cis-enhanced stabilization of the interface. We observe an abrupt concentration dependence on recruitment into adhesions of constant crystalline density, reminiscent of a first-order phase transition. Removing the lateral cis interaction with a \"cis mutant\" shifts this transition to higher surface densities leading to denser, yet weaker adhesions. In both proteins, the stabilization of progressively larger areas of deformation is consistent with single-molecule experiments that show a force-dependent lifetime enhancement in the cadherin ectodomain, which may be attributed to the \"X-dimer\" bond.",

In this study we focus on a subset of RBD mutations that have been frequently observed in infected individuals and probe binding affinity changes to ACE2 using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements and free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. Our SPR results are largely in accord with previous studies but discrepancies do arise due to differences in experimental methods and to protocol differences even when a single method is used. Overall, we find that FEP performance is superior to that of other computational approaches examined as determined by agreement with experiment and, in particular, by its ability to identify stabilizing mutations. Moreover, the calculations successfully predict the observed cooperative stabilization of binding by the Q498R N501Y double mutant present in Omicron variants and offer a physical explanation for the underlying mechanism. Overall, our results suggest that despite the significant computational cost, FEP calculations may offer an effective strategy to understand the effects of interfacial mutations on protein-protein binding affinities and, hence, in a variety of practical applications such as the optimization of neutralizing antibodies.",

Yet, adaptive resistance mechanisms, induced by rapid, context-specific signaling network rewiring, continue to challenge therapeutic efficacy. By leveraging progress in proteomic technologies and network-based methodologies, over the past decade, we developed VESPA-an algorithm designed to elucidate mechanisms of cell response and adaptation to drug perturbations-and used it to analyze 7-point phosphoproteomic time series from colorectal cancer cells treated with clinically-relevant inhibitors and control media. Interrogation of tumor-specific enzyme/substrate interactions accurately inferred kinase and phosphatase activity, based on their inferred substrate phosphorylation state, effectively accounting for signal cross-talk and sparse phosphoproteome coverage. The analysis elucidated time-dependent signaling pathway response to each drug perturbation and, more importantly, cell adaptive response and rewiring that was experimentally confirmed by CRISPRko assays, suggesting broad applicability to cancer and other diseases.",

        "Abstract": "We describe the Predicting Protein-Compound Interactions (PrePCI) database which comprises over 5 billion predicted interactions between 6.8 million chemical compounds and 19,797 human proteins. PrePCI relies on a proteome-wide database of structural models based on both traditional modeling techniques and the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database. Sequence- and structural similarity-based metrics are established between template proteins, T, in the Protein Data Bank that bind compounds, C, and query proteins in the model database, Q. When the metrics exceed threshold values, it is assumed that C also binds to Q with a likelihood ratio (LR) derived from machine learning. If the relationship is based on structural similarity, the LR is based on a scoring function that measures the extent to which C is compatible with the binding site of Q as described in the LT-scanner algorithm. For every predicted complex derived in this way, chemical similarity based on the Tanimoto coefficient identifies other small molecules that may bind to Q. An overall LR for the binding of C to Q is obtained from Naive Bayesian statistics. The PrePCI database can be queried by entering a UniProt ID or gene name for a protein to obtain a list of compounds predicted to bind to it along with associated LRs. Alternatively, entering an identifier for the compound outputs a list of proteins it is predicted to bind. Specific applications of the database to lead discovery, elucidation of drug mechanism of action, and biological function annotation are described.",

        "Abstract": "Neurons in the developing brain express many different cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) on their surfaces. CAM-binding affinities can vary by more than 200-fold, but the significance of these variations is unknown. Interactions between the immunoglobulin superfamily CAM DIP-\u03b1 and its binding partners, Dpr10 and Dpr6, control synaptic targeting and survival of Drosophila optic lobe neurons. We design mutations that systematically change interaction affinity and analyze function in\u00a0vivo. Reducing affinity causes loss-of-function phenotypes whose severity scales with the magnitude of the change. Synaptic targeting is more sensitive to affinity reduction than is cell survival. Increasing affinity rescues neurons that would normally be culled by apoptosis. By manipulating CAM expression together with affinity, we show that the key parameter controlling circuit assembly is surface avidity, which is the strength of adherence between cell surfaces. We conclude that CAM binding affinities and expression levels are finely tuned for function during development.",

Conserved Trp2 and Trp4 residues in type II cadherins anchor the EC1 A strand intermolecularly in strand-swapped dimers. Herein, NMR spectroscopy is used to elucidate the roles of Trp2 and Trp4 in Cadherin-11 dimerization. The monomeric state, with the A strand and Trp side chains packed intramolecularly, is in equilibrium with sparsely populated partially and fully A-strand-exposed states, in which Trp2 (and Trp4, respectively) side-chain packing is disrupted. Exchange kinetics between the major state and the partially (fully) A-strand-exposed state is slow-intermediate (intermediate-fast). A separate very fast process exchanges ordered and random-coil BC-loop conformations with populations dependent on A-strand exposure and dimerization status. In addition, very slow processes connect the folded A-strand-exposed conformation to partially unfolded states, which may represent additional domain-swapping intermediates. The dimerization mechanism of type II cadherins is revealed as coupled folding and strand swapping.",

        "Abstract": "Systems biology is a data-heavy field that focuses on systems-wide depictions of biological phenomena necessarily sacrificing a detailed characterization of individual components. As an example, genome-wide protein interaction networks are widely used in systems biology and continuously extended and refined as new sources of evidence become available. Despite the vast amount of information about individual protein structures and protein complexes that has accumulated in the past 50 years in the Protein Data Bank, the data, computational tools, and language of structural biology are not an integral part of systems biology. However, increasing effort has been devoted to this integration, and the related literature is reviewed here. Relationships between proteins that are detected via structural similarity offer a rich source of information not available from sequence similarity, and homology modeling can be used to leverage Protein Data Bank structures to produce 3D models for a significant fraction of many proteomes. A number of structure-informed genomic and cross-species (i.e., virus-host) interactomes will be described, and the unique information they provide will be illustrated with a number of examples. Tissue- and tumor-specific interactomes have also been developed through computational strategies that exploit patient information and through genetic interactions available from increasingly sensitive screens. Strategies to integrate structural information with these alternate data sources will be described. Finally, efforts to link protein structure space with chemical compound space offer novel sources of information in drug design, off-target identification, and the identification of targets for compounds found to be effective in phenotypic screens.",

        "Abstract": "Viruses deploy genetically encoded strategies to coopt host machinery and support viral replicative cycles. Here, we use protein structure similarity to scan for molecular mimicry, manifested by structural similarity between viral and endogenous host proteins, across thousands of cataloged viruses and hosts spanning broad ecological niches and taxonomic range, including bacteria, plants and fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates. This survey identified over 6,000,000 instances of structural mimicry; more than 70% of viral mimics cannot be discerned through protein sequence alone. We demonstrate that the manner and degree to which viruses exploit molecular mimicry varies by genome size and nucleic acid type and identify 158 human proteins that are mimicked by coronaviruses, providing clues about cellular processes driving pathogenesis. Our observations point to molecular mimicry as a pervasive strategy employed by viruses and indicate that the protein structure space used by a given virus is dictated by the host proteome. A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.",

Current interaction models and pathways, however, lack context specificity and are not oncoprotein specific. We introduce SigMaps as context-specific networks, comprising modulators, effectors and cognate binding-partners of a specific oncoprotein. SigMaps are reconstructed de novo by integrating diverse evidence sources-including protein structure, gene expression and mutational profiles-via the OncoSig machine learning framework. We first generated a KRAS-specific SigMap for lung adenocarcinoma, which recapitulated published KRAS biology, identified novel synthetic lethal proteins that were experimentally validated in three-dimensional spheroid models and established uncharacterized crosstalk with RAB/RHO. To show that OncoSig is generalizable, we first inferred SigMaps for the ten most mutated human oncoproteins and then for the full repertoire of 715 proteins in the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census. Taken together, these SigMaps show that the cell's regulatory and signaling architecture is highly tissue specific.",

        "Title": "Bi-allelic missense disease-causing variants in RPL3L associate neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy with muscle-specific ribosome biogenesis.",
        "Abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) belongs to the most frequent forms of cardiomyopathy mainly characterized by cardiac dilatation and reduced systolic function. Although most cases of DCM are classified as sporadic, 20-30% of cases show a heritable pattern. Familial forms of DCM are genetically heterogeneous, and mutations in several genes have been identified that most commonly play a role in cytoskeleton and sarcomere-associated processes. Still, a large number of familial cases remain unsolved. Here, we report five individuals from three independent families who presented with severe dilated cardiomyopathy during the neonatal period. Using whole-exome sequencing (WES), we identified causative, compound heterozygous missense variants in RPL3L (ribosomal protein L3-like) in all the affected individuals. The identified variants co-segregated with the disease in each of the three families and were absent or very rare in the human population, in line with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. They are located within the conserved RPL3 domain of the protein and were classified as deleterious by several in silico prediction software applications. RPL3L is one of the four non-canonical riboprotein genes and it encodes the 60S ribosomal protein L3-like protein that is highly expressed only in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Three-dimensional homology modeling and in silico analysis of the affected residues in RPL3L indicate that the identified changes specifically alter the interaction of RPL3L with the RNA components of the 60S ribosomal subunit and thus destabilize its binding to the 60S subunit. In conclusion, we report that bi-allelic pathogenic variants in RPL3L are causative of an early-onset, severe neonatal form of dilated cardiomyopathy, and we show for the first time that cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of non-syndromic cardiomyopathies.",

        "Abstract": "Differential binding affinities among closely related protein family members underlie many biological phenomena, including cell-cell recognition. Drosophila DIP and Dpr proteins mediate neuronal targeting in the fly through highly specific protein-protein interactions. We show here that DIPs/Dprs segregate into seven specificity subgroups defined by binding preferences between their DIP and Dpr members. We then describe a sequence-, structure- and energy-based computational approach, combined with experimental binding affinity measurements, to reveal how specificity is coded on the canonical DIP/Dpr interface. We show that binding specificity of DIP/Dpr subgroups is controlled by \"negative constraints\", which interfere with binding. To achieve specificity, each subgroup utilizes a different combination of negative constraints, which are broadly distributed and cover the majority of the protein-protein interface. We discuss the structural origins of negative constraints, and potential general implications for the evolutionary origins of binding specificity in multi-protein families.",

        "Abstract": "We study punctate adherens junctions (pAJs) to determine how short-lived cadherin clusters and relatively stable actin bundles interact despite differences in dynamics. We show that pAJ-linked bundles consist of two distinct regions-the bundle stalk (AJ-BS) and a tip (AJ-BT) positioned between cadherin clusters and the stalk. The tip differs from the stalk in a number of ways: it is devoid of the actin-bundling protein calponin, and exhibits a much faster F-actin turnover rate. While F-actin in the stalk displays centripetal movement, the F-actin in the tip is immobile. The F-actin turnover in both the tip and stalk is dependent on cadherin cluster stability, which in turn is regulated by F-actin. The close bidirectional coupling between the stability of cadherin and associated F-actin shows how pAJs, and perhaps other AJs, allow cells to sense and coordinate the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in neighboring cells-a mechanism we term \"dynasensing.\"",

        "Abstract": "Non-clustered \u03b41- and \u03b42-protocadherins, close relatives of clustered protocadherins, function in cell adhesion and motility and play essential roles in neural patterning. To understand the molecular interactions underlying these functions, we used solution biophysics to characterize binding of \u03b41- and \u03b42-protocadherins, determined crystal structures of ectodomain complexes from each family, and assessed ectodomain assembly in reconstituted intermembrane junctions by cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET). Homophilic trans (cell-cell) interactions were preferred for all \u03b4-protocadherins, with additional weaker heterophilic interactions observed exclusively within each subfamily. As expected, \u03b41- and \u03b42-protocadherin trans dimers formed through antiparallel EC1-EC4 interfaces, like clustered protocadherins. However, no ectodomain-mediated cis (same-cell) interactions were detectable in solution; consistent with this, cryo-ET of reconstituted junctions revealed dense assemblies lacking the characteristic order observed for clustered protocadherins. Our results define non-clustered protocadherin binding properties and their structural basis, providing a foundation for interpreting their functional roles in neural patterning.",

        "Abstract": "While knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is critical for understanding virus-host relationships, limitations on the scalability of high-throughput methods have hampered their identification beyond a number of well-studied viruses. Here, we implement an in silico computational framework (pathogen host interactome prediction using structure similarity [P-HIPSTer]) that employs structural information to predict \u223c282,000 pan viral-human PPIs with an experimental validation rate of \u223c76%. In addition to rediscovering known biology, P-HIPSTer has yielded a series of new findings: the discovery of shared and unique machinery employed across human-infecting viruses, a likely role for ZIKV-ESR1 interactions in modulating viral replication, the identification of PPIs that discriminate between human papilloma viruses (HPVs) with high and low oncogenic potential, and a structure-enabled history of evolutionary selective pressure imposed on the human proteome. Further, P-HIPSTer enables discovery of previously unappreciated cellular circuits that act on human-infecting viruses and provides insight into experimentally intractable viruses.",

        "Abstract": "Binding between DIP and Dpr neuronal recognition proteins has been proposed to regulate synaptic connections between lamina and medulla neurons in the Drosophila visual system. Each lamina neuron was previously shown to express many Dprs. Here, we demonstrate, by contrast, that their synaptic partners typically express one or two DIPs, with binding specificities matched to the lamina neuron-expressed Dprs. A deeper understanding of the molecular logic of DIP/Dpr interaction requires quantitative studies on the properties of these proteins. We thus generated a quantitative affinity-based DIP/Dpr interactome for all DIP/Dpr protein family members. This revealed a broad range of affinities and identified homophilic binding for some DIPs and some Dprs. These data, along with full-length ectodomain DIP/Dpr and DIP/DIP crystal structures, led to the identification of molecular determinants of DIP/Dpr specificity. This structural knowledge, along with a comprehensive set of quantitative binding affinities, provides new tools for functional studies in\u00a0vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Drosophila Dpr (21 paralogs) and DIP proteins (11 paralogs) are cell recognition molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) that form a complex protein interaction network. DIP and Dpr proteins are expressed in a synaptic layer-specific fashion in the visual system. How interactions between these proteins regulate layer-specific synaptic circuitry is not known. Here we establish that DIP-\u03b1 and its interacting partners Dpr6 and Dpr10 regulate multiple processes, including arborization within layers, synapse number, layer specificity, and cell survival. We demonstrate that heterophilic binding between Dpr6/10 and DIP-\u03b1 and homophilic binding between DIP-\u03b1 proteins promote interactions between processes in\u00a0vivo. Knockin mutants disrupting the DIP/Dpr binding interface reveal a role for these proteins during normal development, while ectopic expression studies support an instructive role for interactions between DIPs and Dprs in circuit development. These studies support an important role for the DIP/Dpr protein interaction network in regulating cell-type-specific connectivity patterns.",

        "Abstract": "Transcription factors bind to their binding sites over a wide range of affinities, yet how differences in affinity are encoded in DNA sequences is not well understood. Here, we report X-ray crystal structures of four heterodimers of the Hox protein AbdominalB bound with its cofactor Extradenticle to four target DNA molecules that differ in affinity by up to \u223c20-fold. Remarkably, despite large differences in affinity, the overall structures are very similar in all four complexes. In contrast, the predicted shapes of the DNA binding sites (i.e., the intrinsic DNA shape) in the absence of bound protein are strikingly different from each other and correlate with affinity: binding sites that must change conformations upon protein binding have lower affinities than binding sites that have more optimal conformations prior to binding. Together, these observations suggest that intrinsic differences in DNA shape provide a robust mechanism for modulating affinity without affecting other protein-DNA interactions.",

        "Abstract": "Underlying a cancer phenotype is a specific gene regulatory network that represents the complex regulatory relationships between genes. However, it remains a challenge to find cancer-related gene regulatory network because of insufficient sample sizes and complex regulatory mechanisms in which gene is influenced by not only other genes but also other biological factors. With the development of high-throughput technologies and the unprecedented wealth of multi-omics data give us a new opportunity to design machine learning method to investigate underlying gene regulatory network. In this paper, we propose an approach, which use biweight midcorrelation to measure the correlation between factors and make use of nonconvex penalty based sparse regression for gene regulatory network inference (BMNPGRN). BMNCGRN incorporates multi-omics data (including DNA methylation and copy number variation) and their interactions in gene regulatory network model. The experimental results on synthetic datasets show that BMNPGRN outperforms popular and state-of-the-art methods (including DCGRN, ARACNE and CLR) under false positive control. Furthermore, we applied BMNPGRN on breast cancer (BRCA) data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and provided gene regulatory network.",

        "Abstract": "The tip link, a filament formed by protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and cadherin 23, conveys mechanical force from sound waves and head movement to\u00a0open hair-cell mechanotransduction channels. Tip-link cadherins are thought to have acquired structural features critical for their role in mechanotransduction. Here, we biophysically and structurally characterize the unusual cis-homodimeric architecture of PCDH15. We show that PCDH15 molecules form double-helical assemblies through cis-dimerization interfaces in the extracellular cadherin EC2-EC3 domain region and in a unique membrane-proximal domain. Electron microscopy studies visualize the cis-dimeric PCDH15 assembly and reveal the PCDH15 extracellular domain as a parallel double helix with cis cross-bridges at the two locations we defined. The\u00a0helical configuration suggests the potential for\u00a0elasticity through helix winding and unwinding. Functional studies in hair cells show that mutations that perturb PCDH15 dimerization contacts affect mechanotransduction. Together, these data reveal the cis-dimeric architecture of PCDH15 and show that dimerization is critical for sensing mechanical stimuli.",

        "Abstract": "Type II cadherins are cell-cell adhesion proteins critical for tissue patterning and neuronal targeting but whose molecular binding code remains poorly understood. Here, we delineate binding preferences for type II cadherin cell-adhesive regions, revealing extensive heterophilic interactions between specific pairs, in addition to homophilic interactions. Three distinct specificity groups emerge from our analysis with members that share highly similar heterophilic binding patterns and favor binding to one another. Structures of adhesive fragments from each specificity group confirm near-identical dimer topology conserved throughout the family, allowing interface residues whose conservation corresponds to specificity preferences to be identified. We show that targeted mutation of these residues converts binding preferences between specificity groups in biophysical and co-culture assays. Our results provide a detailed understanding of the type II cadherin interaction map and a basis for defining their role in tissue patterning and for the emerging importance of their heterophilic interactions in neural connectivity.",

        "Abstract": "Adherens junctions (AJs) play a fundamental role in tissue integrity; however, the organization and dynamics of the key AJ transmembrane protein, E-cadherin, both inside and outside of AJs, remain controversial. Here we have studied the distribution and motility of E-cadherin in punctate AJs (pAJs) of A431 cells. Using single-molecule localization microscopy, we show that pAJs in these cells reach more than 1 \u03bcm in length and consist of several cadherin clusters with crystal-like density interspersed within sparser cadherin regions. Notably, extrajunctional cadherin appears to be monomeric, and its density is almost four orders of magnitude less than observed in the pAJ regions. Two alternative strategies of tracking cadherin motion within individual junctions show that pAJs undergo actin-dependent rapid-on the order of seconds-internal reorganizations, during which dense clusters disassemble and their cadherins are immediately reused for new clusters. Our results thus modify the classical view of AJs by depicting them as mosaics of cadherin clusters, the short lifetimes of which enable stable overall morphology combined with rapid internal rearrangements.",

        "Abstract": "We report a template-based method, LT-scanner, which scans the human proteome using protein structural alignment to identify proteins that are likely to bind ligands that are present in experimentally determined complexes. A scoring function that rapidly accounts for binding site similarities between the template and the proteins being scanned is a crucial feature of the method. The overall approach is first tested based on its ability to predict the residues on the surface of a protein that are likely to bind small-molecule ligands. The algorithm that we present, LBias, is shown to compare very favorably to existing algorithms for binding site residue prediction. LT-scanner's performance is evaluated based on its ability to identify known targets of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and it too proves to be highly effective. The specificity of the scoring function that we use is demonstrated by the ability of LT-scanner to identify the known targets of FDA-approved kinase inhibitors based on templates involving other kinases. Combining sequence with structural information further improves LT-scanner performance. The approach we describe is extendable to the more general problem of identifying binding partners of known ligands even if they do not appear in a structurally determined complex, although this will require the integration of methods that combine protein structure and chemical compound databases.",

        "Abstract": "Protein-DNA binding is a fundamental component of gene regulatory processes, but it is still not completely understood how proteins recognize their target sites in the genome. Besides hydrogen bonding in the major groove (base readout), proteins recognize minor-groove geometry using positively charged amino acids (shape readout). The underlying mechanism of DNA shape readout involves the correlation between minor-groove width and electrostatic potential (EP). To probe this biophysical effect directly, rather than using minor-groove width as an indirect measure for shape readout, we developed a methodology, DNAphi, for predicting EP in the minor groove and confirmed the direct role of EP in protein-DNA binding using massive sequencing data. The DNAphi method uses a sliding-window approach to mine results from non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann (NLPB) calculations on DNA structures derived from all-atom Monte Carlo simulations. We validated this approach, which only requires nucleotide sequence as input, based on direct comparison with NLPB calculations for available crystal structures. Using statistical machine-learning approaches, we showed that adding EP as a biophysical feature can improve the predictive power of quantitative binding specificity models across 27 transcription factor families. High-throughput prediction of EP offers a novel way to integrate biophysical and genomic studies of protein-DNA binding.",

These O-Man glycans do not appear to be elongated like O-Man glycans found on \u03b1-dystroglycan (\u03b1-DG), and we recently demonstrated that initiation of cdh/protocadherin (pcdh) O-Man glycosylation is not dependent on the evolutionary conserved POMT1/POMT2 enzymes that initiate O-Man glycosylation on \u03b1-DG.

        "Abstract": "Post translational modification plays a significiant role in the biological processing. The potential post translational modification is composed of the center sites and the adjacent amino acid residues which are fundamental protein sequence residues. It can be helpful to perform their biological functions and contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms that are the foundations of protein design and drug design. The existing algorithms of predicting modified sites often have some shortcomings, such as lower stability and accuracy. In this paper, a combination of physical, chemical, statistical, and biological properties of a protein have been ulitized as the features, and a novel framework is proposed to predict a protein's post translational modification sites. The multi-layer neural network and support vector machine are invoked to predict the potential modified sites with the selected features that include the compositions of amino acid residues, the E-H description of protein segments, and several properties from the AAIndex database. Being aware of the possible redundant information, the feature selection is proposed in the propocessing step in this research. The experimental results show that the proposed method has the ability to improve the accuracy in this classification issue.",

Recent structural, biophysical, computational, and cell-based studies on protocadherin structure and function have led to a compelling molecular model for the barcoding mechanism. Protocadherin isoforms assemble into promiscuous cis-dimeric recognition units and mediate cell-cell recognition through homophilic trans-interactions. Each recognition unit is composed of two arms extending from the membrane proximal EC6 domains. A cis-dimeric recognition unit with each arm coding adhesive trans homophilic specificity can generate a zipper-like assembly that in turn suggests a chain termination mechanism for self-vs-non-self-discrimination among vertebrate neurons.",

To address this challenge, we describe the development of a multiplex combinatorial strategy to assess pairwise genetic interactions using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and next-generation sequencing. We characterize the performance of combinatorial genome editing and analysis using different promoter and gRNA designs and identified regions of the chimeric RNA that are compatible with next-generation sequencing preparation and quantification. This approach is an important step towards elucidating genetic networks relevant to human diseases and the development of more efficient Cas9-based therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Direct calculation of relative binding affinities between antibodies and antigens is a long-sought goal. However, despite substantial efforts, no generally applicable computational method has been described. Here, we describe a systematic free energy perturbation (FEP) protocol and calculate the binding affinities between the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 and three broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) of the VRC01 class. The protocol has been adapted from successful studies of small molecules to address the challenges associated with modeling protein-protein interactions. Specifically, we built homology models of the three antibody-gp120 complexes, extended the sampling times for large bulky residues, incorporated the modeling of glycans on the surface of gp120, and utilized continuum solvent-based loop prediction protocols to improve sampling. We present three experimental surface plasmon resonance data sets, in which antibody residues in the antibody/gp120 interface were systematically mutated to alanine. The RMS error in the large set (55 total cases) of FEP tests as compared to these experiments, 0.68kcal/mol, is near experimental accuracy, and it compares favorably with the results obtained from a simpler, empirical methodology.

        "Title": "Silencing c-Myc translation as a therapeutic strategy through targeting PI3K\u03b4 and CK1\u03b5 in hematological malignancies.",
        "Abstract": "Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and the proteasome pathway are both involved in activating the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Because mTOR signaling is required for initiation of messenger RNA translation, we hypothesized that cotargeting the PI3K and proteasome pathways might synergistically inhibit translation of c-Myc. We found that a novel PI3K \u03b4 isoform inhibitor TGR-1202, but not the approved PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor idelalisib, was highly synergistic with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib in lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma cell lines and primary lymphoma and leukemia cells. TGR-1202 and carfilzomib (TC) synergistically inhibited phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), leading to suppression of c-Myc translation and silencing of c-Myc-dependent transcription. The synergistic cytotoxicity of TC was rescued by overexpression of eIF4E or c-Myc. TGR-1202, but not other PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors, inhibited casein kinase-1 \u03b5 (CK1\u03b5). Targeting CK1\u03b5 using a selective chemical inhibitor or short hairpin RNA complements the effects of idelalisib, as a single agent or in combination with carfilzomib, in repressing phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the protein level of c-Myc. These results suggest that TGR-1202 is a dual PI3K\u03b4/CK1\u03b5 inhibitor, which may in part explain the clinical activity of TGR-1202 in aggressive lymphoma not found with idelalisib. Targeting CK1\u03b5 should become an integral part of therapeutic strategies targeting translation of oncogenes such as c-Myc.",

Of these at least 127,000 are expected to constitute direct physical interactions although the actual number may be much larger (~500,000). The current PrePPI, which contains predicted interactions for about 85% of the human proteome, is related to an earlier version but is based on additional sources of interaction evidence and is far larger in scope. The use of structural relationships allows PrePPI to infer numerous previously unreported interactions. PrePPI has been subjected to a series of validation tests including reproducing known interactions, recapitulating multi-protein complexes, analysis of disease associated SNPs, and identifying functional relationships between interacting proteins. We show, using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), that predicted interaction partners can be used to annotate a protein's function. We provide annotations for most human proteins, including many annotated as having unknown function.",

        "Title": "Acetylation-regulated interaction between p53 and SET reveals a widespread regulatory mode.",
        "Abstract": "Although lysine acetylation is now recognized as a general protein modification for both histones and non-histone proteins, the mechanisms of acetylation-mediated actions are not completely understood. Acetylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of p53 (also known as TP53) was an early example of non-histone protein acetylation and its precise role remains unclear. Lysine acetylation often creates binding sites for bromodomain-containing 'reader' proteins. Here we use a proteomic screen to identify the oncoprotein SET as a major cellular factor whose binding with p53 is dependent on CTD acetylation status. SET profoundly inhibits p53 transcriptional activity in unstressed cells, but SET-mediated repression is abolished by stress-induced acetylation of p53 CTD. Moreover, loss of the interaction with SET activates p53, resulting in tumour regression in mouse xenograft models. Notably, the acidic domain of SET acts as a 'reader' for the unacetylated CTD of p53 and this mechanism of acetylation-dependent regulation is widespread in nature. For example, acetylation of p53 also modulates its interactions with similar acidic domains found in other p53 regulators including VPRBP (also known as DCAF1), DAXX and PELP1 (refs. 7, 8, 9), and computational analysis of the proteome has identified numerous proteins with the potential to serve as acidic domain readers and lysine-rich ligands. Unlike bromodomain readers, which preferentially bind the acetylated forms of their cognate ligands, the acidic domain readers specifically recognize the unacetylated forms of their ligands. Finally, the acetylation-dependent regulation of p53 was further validated in vivo by using a knock-in mouse model expressing an acetylation-mimicking form of p53. These results reveal that acidic-domain-containing factors act as a class of acetylation-dependent regulators by targeting p53 and, potentially, other proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Lymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinase (Lck) plays an essential role in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and T cell development, but its activation mechanism is not fully understood. To explore the possibility that plasma membrane (PM) lipids control TCR signaling activities of Lck, we measured the membrane binding properties of its regulatory Src homology 2 (SH2) and Src homology 3 domains. The Lck SH2 domain binds anionic PM lipids with high affinity but with low specificity. Electrostatic potential calculation, NMR analysis, and mutational studies identified the lipid-binding site of the Lck SH2 domain that includes surface-exposed basic, aromatic, and hydrophobic residues but not the phospho-Tyr binding pocket. Mutation of lipid binding residues greatly reduced the interaction of Lck with the \u03b6 chain in the activated TCR signaling complex and its overall TCR signaling activities. These results suggest that PM lipids, including phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, modulate interaction of Lck with its binding partners in the TCR signaling complex and its TCR signaling activities in a spatiotemporally specific manner via its SH2 domain.",

        "Abstract": "Desmosomes are intercellular adhesive junctions that impart strength to vertebrate tissues. Their dense, ordered intercellular attachments are formed by desmogleins (Dsgs) and desmocollins (Dscs), but the nature of trans-cellular interactions between these specialized cadherins is unclear. Here, using solution biophysics and coated-bead aggregation experiments, we demonstrate family-wise heterophilic specificity: All Dsgs form adhesive dimers with all Dscs, with affinities characteristic of each Dsg:Dsc pair. Crystal structures of ectodomains from Dsg2 and Dsg3 and from Dsc1 and Dsc2 show binding through a strand-swap mechanism similar to that of homophilic classical cadherins. However, conserved charged amino acids inhibit Dsg:Dsg and Dsc:Dsc interactions by same-charge repulsion and promote heterophilic Dsg:Dsc interactions through opposite-charge attraction. These findings show that Dsg:Dsc heterodimers represent the fundamental adhesive unit of desmosomes and provide a structural framework for understanding desmosome assembly.",

        "Abstract": "Clustered protocadherin proteins (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-Pcdhs) provide a high level of cell-surface diversity to individual vertebrate neurons, engaging in highly specific homophilic interactions to mediate important roles in mammalian neural circuit development. How Pcdhs bind homophilically through their extracellular cadherin (EC) domains among dozens of highly similar isoforms has not been determined. Here, we report crystal structures for extracellular regions from four mouse Pcdh isoforms (\u03b14, \u03b17, \u03b26, and \u03b28), revealing a canonical head-to-tail interaction mode for homophilic trans dimers comprising primary intermolecular EC1:EC4 and EC2:EC3 interactions. A subset of trans interface residues exhibit isoform-specific conservation, suggesting roles in recognition specificity. Mutation of these residues, along with trans-interacting partner residues, altered the specificities of Pcdh interactions. Together, these data show how sequence variation among Pcdh isoforms encodes their diverse strict homophilic recognition specificities, which are required for their key roles in neural circuit assembly.",

        "Abstract": "The existence of adult pancreatic progenitor cells has been debated. While some favor the concept of facultative progenitors involved in homeostasis and repair, neither a location nor markers for such cells have been defined. Using genetic lineage tracing, we show that Doublecortin-like kinase-1 (Dclk1) labels a rare population of long-lived, quiescent pancreatic cells. In vitro, Dclk1+ cells proliferate readily and sustain pancreatic organoid growth. In vivo, Dclk1+ cells are necessary for pancreatic regeneration following injury and chronic inflammation. Accordingly, their loss has detrimental effects after cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Expression of mutant Kras in Dclk1+ cells does not affect their quiescence or longevity. However, experimental pancreatitis converts Kras mutant Dclk1+ cells into potent cancer-initiating cells. As a potential effector of Kras, Dclk1 contributes functionally to the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. Taken together, these observations indicate that Dclk1 marks quiescent pancreatic progenitors that are candidates for the origin of pancreatic cancer.",

        "Abstract": "The Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain is a protein interaction domain that directs myriad phosphotyrosine (pY)-signaling pathways. Genome-wide screening of human SH2 domains reveals that \u223c90% of SH2 domains bind plasma membrane lipids and many have high phosphoinositide specificity. They bind lipids using surface cationic patches separate from pY-binding pockets, thus binding lipids and the pY motif independently. The patches form grooves for specific lipid headgroup recognition or flat surfaces for non-specific membrane binding and both types of interaction are important for cellular function and regulation of SH2 domain-containing proteins. Cellular studies with ZAP70 showed that multiple lipids bind its C-terminal SH2 domain in a spatiotemporally specific manner and thereby exert exquisite spatiotemporal control over its protein binding and signaling activities in T cells. Collectively, this study reveals how lipids control SH2 domain-mediated cellular protein-protein interaction networks and suggest a new strategy for therapeutic modulation of pY-signaling pathways.",

        "Abstract": "Self-avoidance, a process preventing interactions of axons and dendrites from the same neuron during development, is mediated in vertebrates through the stochastic single-neuron expression of clustered protocadherin protein isoforms. Extracellular cadherin (EC) domains mediate isoform-specific homophilic binding between cells, conferring cell recognition through a poorly understood mechanism. Here, we report crystal structures for the EC1-EC3 domain regions from four protocadherin isoforms representing the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 subfamilies. All are rod shaped and monomeric in solution. Biophysical measurements, cell aggregation assays, and computational docking reveal that trans binding between cells depends on the EC1-EC4 domains, which interact in an antiparallel orientation. We also show that the EC6 domains are required for the formation of cis-dimers. Overall, our results are consistent with a model in which protocadherin cis-dimers engage in a head-to-tail interaction between EC1-EC4 domains from apposed cell surfaces, possibly forming a zipper-like protein assembly, and thus providing a size-dependent self-recognition mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)-dependent Rac exchanger 2 (PREX2) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) GTPase, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac1. GTP-bound Rac1 then activates its downstream effectors, including p21-activated kinases (PAKs). PREX2 and Rac1 are frequently mutated in cancer and have key roles within the insulin-signaling pathway. Rac1 can be inactivated by multiple mechanisms; however, negative regulation by insulin is not well understood. Here, we show that in response to being activated after insulin stimulation, Rac1 initiates its own inactivation by decreasing PREX2 GEF activity. Following PREX2-mediated activation of Rac1 by the second messengers PIP3 or G\u03b2\u03b3, we found that PREX2 was phosphorylated through a PAK-dependent mechanism. PAK-mediated phosphorylation of PREX2 reduced GEF activity toward Rac1 by inhibiting PREX2 binding to PIP3 and G\u03b2\u03b3. Cell fractionation experiments also revealed that phosphorylation prevented PREX2 from localizing to the cellular membrane. Furthermore, the onset of insulin-induced phosphorylation of PREX2 was delayed compared with AKT. Altogether, we propose that second messengers activate the Rac1 signal, which sets in motion a cascade whereby PAKs phosphorylate and negatively regulate PREX2 to decrease Rac1 activation. This type of regulation would allow for transient activation of the PREX2-Rac1 signal and may be relevant in multiple physiological processes, including diseases such as diabetes and cancer when insulin signaling is chronically activated.",

        "Abstract": "Epithelial (E)-cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions play important roles in the development and maintenance of tissue structure in multicellular organisms. E-cadherin adhesion is thus a key element of the cellular microenvironment that provides both mechanical and biochemical signaling inputs. Here, we report in vitro reconstitution of junction-like structures between native E-cadherin in living cells and the extracellular domain of E-cadherin (E-cad-ECD) in a supported membrane. Junction formation in this hybrid live cell-supported membrane configuration requires both active processes within the living cell and a supported membrane with low E-cad-ECD mobility. The hybrid junctions recruit \u03b1-catenin and exhibit remodeled cortical actin. Observations suggest that the initial stages of junction formation in this hybrid system depend on the trans but not the cis interactions between E-cadherin molecules, and proceed via a nucleation process in which protrusion and retraction of filopodia play a key role.",

        "Abstract": "The function of the actin-binding domain of \u03b1-catenin, \u03b1ABD, including its possible role in the direct anchorage of the cadherin-catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton, has remained uncertain. We identified two point mutations on the \u03b1ABD surface that interfere with \u03b1ABD binding to actin and used them to probe the role of \u03b1-catenin-actin interactions in adherens junctions. We found that the junctions directly bound to actin via \u03b1ABD were more dynamic than the junctions bound to actin indirectly through vinculin and that recombinant \u03b1ABD interacted with cortical actin but not with actin bundles. This interaction resulted in the formation of numerous short-lived cortex-bound \u03b1ABD clusters. Our data suggest that \u03b1ABD clustering drives the continuous assembly of transient, actin-associated cadherin-catenin clusters whose disassembly is maintained by actin depolymerization. It appears then that such actin-dependent \u03b1ABD clustering is a unique molecular mechanism mediating both integrity and reassembly of the cell-cell adhesive interface formed through weak cis- and trans-intercadherin interactions.",

        "Abstract": "The growing structural coverage of proteomes is making structural comparison a powerful tool for function annotation. Such template-based approaches are based on the observation that structural similarity is often sufficient to infer similar function. However, it seems clear that, in addition to structural similarity, the specific characteristics of a given protein should also be taken into account in predicting function. Here we describe PredUs 2.0, a method to predict regions on a protein surface likely to bind other proteins, that is, interfacial residues. PredUs 2.0 is based on the PredUs method that is entirely template-based and uses known binding sites in structurally similar proteins to predict interfacial residues. PredUs 2.0 uses a Bayesian approach to combine the template-based scoring of PredUs with a score that reflects the propensities of individual amino acids to be in interfaces. PredUs 2.0 includes a novel protein size dependent metric to determine the number of residues that should be reported as interfacial. PredUs 2.0 significantly outperforms PredUs as well as other published interface prediction methods.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a method to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) formed between structured domains and short peptide motifs. We take an integrative approach based on consensus patterns of known motifs in databases, structures of domain-motif complexes from the PDB and various sources of non-structural evidence. We combine this set of clues using a Bayesian classifier that reports the likelihood of an interaction and obtain significantly improved prediction performance when compared to individual sources of evidence and to previously reported algorithms. Our Bayesian approach was integrated into PrePPI, a structure-based PPI prediction method that, so far, has been limited to interactions formed between two structured domains. Around 80,000 new domain-motif mediated interactions were predicted, thus enhancing PrePPI's coverage of the human protein interactome.",

We focus on template-based methods where the function of a query protein is deduced from that of a template for which both the structure and function are known. We describe the different ways of identifying a template. These are typically based on sequence analysis but new methods based on purely structural similarity are also being developed that allow function annotation based on structural relationships that cannot be recognized by sequence. The growing number of available structures of known function, improved homology modeling techniques and new developments in the use of structure allow template-based methods to be applied on a proteome-wide scale and in many different biological contexts. This progress significantly expands the range of applicability of structural information in function annotation to a level that previously was only achievable by sequence comparison.",

        "Abstract": "Type I cadherin cell-adhesion proteins are similar in sequence and structure and yet are different enough to mediate highly specific cell-cell recognition phenomena. It has previously been shown that small differences in the homophilic and heterophilic binding affinities of different type I family members can account for the differential cell-sorting behavior. Here we use a combination of X-ray crystallography, analytical ultracentrifugation, surface plasmon resonance and double electron-electron resonance (DEER) electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to identify the molecular determinants of type I cadherin dimerization affinities. Small changes in sequence are found to produce subtle structural and dynamical changes that impact relative affinities, in part via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, and in part through entropic effects because of increased conformational heterogeneity in the bound states as revealed by DEER distance mapping in the dimers. These findings highlight the remarkable ability of evolution to exploit a wide range of molecular properties to produce closely related members of the same protein family that have affinity differences finely tuned to mediate their biological roles.",

However, it is still mysterious how these mechanisms were established and how they work in plant cells. Here we show that AKR2A, the cytosolic targeting factor for chloroplast outer membrane (COM) proteins, evolved from the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of the host cell by stepwise extensions of its N-terminal domain and that two lipids, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), of the endosymbiont were selected to function as the AKR2A receptor. Structural analysis, molecular modeling, and mutational analysis of the ARD identified two adjacent sites for coincidental and synergistic binding of MGDG and PG. Based on these findings, we propose that the targeting mechanism of COM proteins was established using components from both the endosymbiont and host cell through a modification of the protein-protein-interacting ARD into a lipid binding domain.",

        "Abstract": "Individual mammalian neurons stochastically express distinct repertoires of \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 protocadherin (Pcdh) proteins, which function in neural circuit assembly. We report that all three subfamilies of clustered Pcdhs can engage in specific homophilic interactions, that cell surface delivery of Pcdh\u03b1 isoforms requires cis interactions with other Pcdhs, and that the extracellular cadherin domain EC6 plays a critical role in this process. Examination of homophilic interactions between specific combinations of multiple Pcdh isoforms revealed that Pcdh combinatorial recognition specificities depend on the identity of all of the expressed isoforms. A single mismatched Pcdh isoform can interfere with these combinatorial homophilic interactions. A theoretical analysis reveals that assembly of Pcdh isoforms into multimeric recognition units and the observed tolerance for mismatched isoforms can generate cell surface diversity sufficient for single-cell identity. However, the competing demands of nonself discrimination and self-recognition place limitations on the mechanisms by which homophilic recognition units can function.",

TFs predicted in the Drosophila melanogaster genome are annotated and classified and their structures, obtained via experiment or homology models, are provided. All known preferred TF DNA-binding sites obtained from the B1H, DNase I and SELEX methodologies are presented. DNA shape parameters predicted for these sites are obtained from a high throughput server or from crystal structures of protein-DNA complexes where available. An important feature of the database is that all DNA-binding domains and their binding sites are fully annotated in a eukaryote using structural criteria and evolutionary homology. OnTheFly thus provides a comprehensive view of TFs and their binding sites that will be a valuable resource for deciphering non-coding regulatory DNA.",

        "Abstract": "Epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin), a member of the classical cadherin family, mediates calcium-dependent homophilic cell-cell adhesion. Crystal structures of classical cadherins reveal an adhesive dimer interface featuring reciprocal exchange of N-terminal \u03b2-strands between two protomers. Previous work has identified a putative intermediate (called the \"X-dimer\") in the dimerization pathway of wild-type E-cadherin EC1-EC2 domains, based on crystal structures of mutants not capable of strand swapping and on deceleration of binding kinetics by mutations at the X-dimer interface. In the present work, NMR relaxation dispersion spectroscopy is used to directly observe and characterize intermediate states without the need to disrupt the strand-swapped binding interface by mutagenesis. The results indicate that E-cadherin forms strand-swapped dimers predominantly by a mechanism in which formation of a weak and short-lived X-dimer-like state precedes the conformational changes required for formation of the mature strand-swapped dimeric structure. Disruption of this intermediate state through mutation reduces both association and dissociation rates by factors of ~10(4), while minimally perturbing affinity. The X-dimer interface lowers the energy barrier associated with strand swapping and enables E-cadherins to form strand-swapped dimers at a rate consistent with residence times in adherens junctions.",

        "Abstract": "The equilibrium constants of trans and cis dimerization of membrane bound (2D) and freely moving (3D) adhesion receptors are expressed and compared using elementary statistical-thermodynamics. Both processes are mediated by the binding of extracellular subdomains whose range of motion in the 2D environment is reduced upon dimerization, defining a thin reaction shell where dimer formation and dissociation take place. We show that the ratio between the 2D and 3D equilibrium constants can be expressed as a product of individual factors describing, respectively, the spatial ranges of motions of the adhesive domains, and their rotational freedom within the reaction shell. The results predicted by the theory are compared to those obtained from a novel, to our knowledge, dynamical simulations methodology, whereby pairs of receptors perform realistic translational, internal, and rotational motions in 2D and 3D. We use cadherins as our model system. The theory and simulations explain how the strength of cis and trans interactions of adhesive receptors are affected both by their presence in the constrained intermembrane space and by the 2D environment of membrane surfaces. Our work provides fundamental insights as to the mechanism of lateral clustering of adhesion receptors after cell-cell contact and, more generally, to the formation of lateral microclusters of proteins on cell surfaces.",

        "Abstract": "We outline a set of strategies to infer protein function from structure. The overall approach depends on extensive use of homology modeling, the exploitation of a wide range of global and local geometric relationships between protein structures and the use of machine learning techniques. The combination of modeling with broad searches of protein structure space defines a \"structural BLAST\" approach to infer function with high genomic coverage. Applications are described to the prediction of protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. In the context of protein-protein interactions, our structure-based prediction algorithm, PrePPI, has comparable accuracy to high-throughput experiments. An essential feature of PrePPI involves the use of Bayesian methods to combine structure-derived information with non-structural evidence (e.g. co-expression) to assign a likelihood for each predicted interaction. This, combined with a structural BLAST approach significantly expands the range of applications of protein structure in the annotation of protein function, including systems level biological applications where it has previously played little role.",

        "Abstract": "PrePPI (http://bhapp.c2b2.columbia.edu/PrePPI) is a database that combines predicted and experimentally determined protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using a Bayesian framework. Predicted interactions are assigned probabilities of being correct, which are derived from calculated likelihood ratios (LRs) by combining structural, functional, evolutionary and expression information, with the most important contribution coming from structure. Experimentally determined interactions are compiled from a set of public databases that manually collect PPIs from the literature and are also assigned LRs. A final probability is then assigned to every interaction by combining the LRs for both predicted and experimentally determined interactions. The current version of PrePPI contains \u223c2 million PPIs that have a probability more than \u223c0.1 of which \u223c60 000 PPIs for yeast and \u223c370 000 PPIs for human are considered high confidence (probability > 0.5). The PrePPI database constitutes an integrated resource that enables users to examine aggregate information on PPIs, including both known and potentially novel interactions, and that provides structural models for many of the PPIs.",

        "Abstract": "The genome-wide identification of pairs of interacting proteins is an important step in the elucidation of cell regulatory mechanisms. Much of our present knowledge derives from high-throughput techniques such as the yeast two-hybrid assay and affinity purification, as well as from manual curation of experiments on individual systems. A variety of computational approaches based, for example, on sequence homology, gene co-expression and phylogenetic profiles, have also been developed for the genome-wide inference of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Yet comparative studies suggest that the development of accurate and complete repertoires of PPIs is still in its early stages. Here we show that three-dimensional structural information can be used to predict PPIs with an accuracy and coverage that are superior to predictions based on non-structural evidence. Moreover, an algorithm, termed PrePPI, which combines structural information with other functional clues, is comparable in accuracy to high-throughput experiments, yielding over 30,000 high-confidence interactions for yeast and over 300,000 for human. Experimental tests of a number of predictions demonstrate the ability of the PrePPI algorithm to identify unexpected PPIs of considerable biological interest. The surprising effectiveness of three-dimensional structural information can be attributed to the use of homology models combined with the exploitation of both close and remote geometric relationships between proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Nectins are immunoglobulin superfamily glycoproteins that mediate intercellular adhesion in many vertebrate tissues. Homophilic and heterophilic interactions between nectin family members help mediate tissue patterning. We determined the homophilic binding affinities and heterophilic specificities of all four nectins and the related protein nectin-like 5 (Necl-5) from human and mouse, revealing a range of homophilic interaction strengths and a defined heterophilic specificity pattern. To understand the molecular basis of their adhesion and specificity, we determined the crystal structures of natively glycosylated full ectodomains or adhesive fragments of all four nectins and Necl-5. All of the crystal structures revealed dimeric nectins bound through a stereotyped interface that was previously proposed to represent a cis dimer. However, conservation of this interface and the results of targeted cross-linking experiments showed that this dimer probably represents the adhesive trans interaction. The structure of the dimer provides a simple molecular explanation for the adhesive binding specificity of nectins.",

        "Abstract": "Cadherins are a superfamily of cell surface glycoproteins whose ectodomains contain multiple repeats of \u03b2-sandwich extracellular cadherin (EC) domains that adopt a similar fold to immunoglobulin domains. The best characterized cadherins are the vertebrate 'classical' cadherins, which mediate adhesion via trans homodimerization between their membrane-distal EC1 domains that extend from apposed cells, and assemble intercellular adherens junctions through cis clustering. To form mature trans adhesive dimers, cadherin domains from apposed cells dimerize in a 'strand-swapped' conformation. This occurs in a two-step binding process involving a fast-binding intermediate called the 'X-dimer'. Trans dimers are less flexible than cadherin monomers, a factor that drives junction assembly following cell-cell contact by reducing the entropic cost associated with the formation of lateral cis oligomers. Cadherins outside the classical subfamily appear to have evolved distinct adhesive mechanisms that are only now beginning to be understood.",

As a pilot study to identify and functionally annodate lipid-binding PIDs on a genomic scale, we performed experimental and computational studies of PDZ domains. Characterization of 70 PDZ domains showed that ~40% had submicromolar membrane affinity. Using a computational model built from these data, we predicted the membrane-binding properties of 2,000 PDZ domains from 20 species. The accuracy of the prediction was experimentally validated for 26 PDZ domains. We also subdivided lipid-binding PDZ domains into three classes based on the interplay between membrane- and protein-binding sites. For different classes of PDZ domains, lipid binding regulates their protein interactions by different mechanisms. Functional studies of a PDZ domain protein, rhophilin 2, suggest that all classes of lipid-binding PDZ domains serve as genuine dual-specificity modules regulating protein interactions at the membrane under physiological conditions.",

Such homo-dimer formation by winged HTH motifs is otherwise found only in two DNA-binding proteins with known structure: the C-terminal wHTH domain of transcriptional activator FadR from E. coli and protein TubR from B. thurigensis, which is involved in plasmid DNA segregation. However, the relative orientation of the wHTH motifs is different and residues involved in DNA-binding are not conserved in Bvu3908 and Bt2368. Hence, the proteins of the present study are not very likely to bind DNA, but are likely to exhibit a function that has thus far not been ascribed to homo-dimers formed by winged HTH motifs.

        "Abstract": "Vertebrate classical cadherins mediate selective calcium-dependent cell adhesion by mechanisms now understood at the atomic level. However, structures and adhesion mechanisms of cadherins from invertebrates, which are highly divergent yet function in similar roles, remain unknown. Here we present crystal structures of three- and four-tandem extracellular cadherin (EC) domain segments from Drosophila N-cadherin (DN-cadherin), each including the predicted N-terminal EC1 domain (denoted EC1') of the mature protein. While the linker regions for the EC1'-EC2' and EC3'-EC4' pairs display binding of three Ca(2+) ions similar to that of vertebrate cadherins, domains EC2' and EC3' are joined in a \"kinked\" orientation by a previously uncharacterized Ca(2+)-free linker. Biophysical analysis demonstrates that a construct containing the predicted N-terminal nine EC domains of DN-cadherin forms homodimers with affinity similar to vertebrate classical cadherins, whereas deleting the ninth EC domain ablates dimerization. These results suggest that, unlike their vertebrate counterparts, invertebrate cadherins may utilize multiple EC domains to form intercellular adhesive bonds. Sequence analysis reveals that similar Ca(2+)-free linkers are widely distributed in the ectodomains of both vertebrate and invertebrate cadherins.",

        "Abstract": "Members of transcription factor families typically have similar DNA binding specificities yet execute unique functions in vivo. Transcription factors often bind DNA as multiprotein complexes, raising the possibility that complex formation might modify their DNA binding specificities. To test this hypothesis, we developed an experimental and computational platform, SELEX-seq, that can be used to determine the relative affinities to any DNA sequence for any transcription factor complex. Applying this method to all eight Drosophila Hox proteins, we show that they obtain novel recognition properties when they bind DNA with the dimeric cofactor Extradenticle-Homothorax (Exd). Exd-Hox specificities group into three main classes that obey Hox gene collinearity rules and DNA structure predictions suggest that anterior and posterior Hox proteins prefer DNA sequences with distinct minor groove topographies. Together, these data suggest that emergent DNA recognition properties revealed by interactions with cofactors contribute to transcription factor specificities in vivo.",

Over the last 7 years, MAGNet investigators have developed many novel analysis methodologies, which have led to important biological discoveries, including understanding the role of the DNA shape in protein-DNA binding specificity and the discovery of genes causally related to the presentation of malignant phenotypes, including lymphoma, glioma, and melanoma. Software tools implementing these methodologies have been broadly adopted by the research community and are made freely available through geWorkbench, the Center's integrated analysis platform. Additionally, MAGNet has been instrumental in organizing and developing key conferences and meetings focused on the emerging field of systems biology and regulatory genomics, with special focus on cancer-related research.",

        "Abstract": "Protein structure modeling by homology requires an accurate sequence alignment between the query protein and its structural template. However, sequence alignment methods based on dynamic programming (DP) are typically unable to generate accurate alignments for remote sequence homologs, thus limiting the applicability of modeling methods. A central problem is that the alignment that is \"optimal\" in terms of the DP score does not necessarily correspond to the alignment that produces the most accurate structural model. That is, the correct alignment based on structural superposition will generally have a lower score than the optimal alignment obtained from sequence. Variations of the DP algorithm have been developed that generate alternative alignments that are \"suboptimal\" in terms of the DP score, but these still encounter difficulties in detecting the correct structural alignment. We present here a new alternative sequence alignment method that relies heavily on the structure of the template. By initially aligning the query sequence to individual fragments in secondary structure elements and combining high-scoring fragments that pass basic tests for \"modelability\", we can generate accurate alignments within a small ensemble. Our results suggest that the set of sequences that can currently be modeled by homology can be greatly extended.",

        "Abstract": "Membrane-bound receptors often form large assemblies resulting from binding to soluble ligands, cell-surface molecules on other cells and extracellular matrix proteins. For example, the association of membrane proteins with proteins on different cells (trans-interactions) can drive the oligomerization of proteins on the same cell (cis-interactions). A central problem in understanding the molecular basis of such phenomena is that equilibrium constants are generally measured in three-dimensional solution and are thus difficult to relate to the two-dimensional environment of a membrane surface. Here we present a theoretical treatment that converts three-dimensional affinities to two dimensions, accounting directly for the structure and dynamics of the membrane-bound molecules. Using a multiscale simulation approach, we apply the theory to explain the formation of ordered, junction-like clusters by classical cadherin adhesion proteins. The approach features atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations to determine interdomain flexibility, Monte Carlo simulations of multidomain motion and lattice simulations of junction formation. A finding of general relevance is that changes in interdomain motion on trans-binding have a crucial role in driving the lateral, cis-, clustering of adhesion receptors.",

        "Abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is caused by mutations in TRPP2 and PKD1, which form an ion channel/receptor complex containing three TRPP2 and one PKD1. A TRPP2 C-terminal coiled-coil trimer, critical for the assembly of this complex, associates with a single PKD1 C-terminal coiled-coil. Many ADPKD pathogenic mutations result in the abolishment of the TRPP2/PKD1 coiled-coil complex. To gain molecular and functional insights into this heterotetrameric complex, we computationally constructed a structural model by using a two-step docking strategy, based on a known crystal structure of the TRPP2 coiled-coil trimer. The model shows that this tetrameric complex has a novel di-trimer configuration: An upstream trimer made of three TRPP2 helices and a downstream trimer made of two TRPP2 helices and one PKD1 helix. Mutagenesis and biochemical analysis identified critical TRPP2/PKD1 interface contacts essential for the heteromeric coiled-coil complex. Mutation of these interface positions in the full-length proteins showed that these interactions were critical for the assembly of the full-length complex in cells. Our results provide a means to specifically weaken the TRPP2 and PKD1 association, thus facilitating future in vitro and in vivo studies on the functional importance of this association.",

We use molecular simulations, measurements of binding affinities and X-ray crystallography to provide a detailed picture of the structural and energetic factors that control the adhesive dimerization of cadherins. We show that strand swapping in EC1 is driven by conformational strain in cadherin monomers that arises from the anchoring of their short N-terminal strand at one end by the conserved Trp2 and at the other by ligation to Ca(2+) ions. We also demonstrate that a conserved proline-proline motif functions to avoid the formation of an overly tight interface where affinity differences between different cadherins, crucial at the cellular level, are lost. We use these findings to design site-directed mutations that transform a monomeric EC2-EC3 domain cadherin construct into a strand-swapped dimer.",

        "Abstract": "Adherens junctions, which play a central role in intercellular adhesion, comprise clusters of type I classical cadherins that bind via extracellular domains extended from opposing cell surfaces. We show that a molecular layer seen in crystal structures of E- and N-cadherin ectodomains reported here and in a previous C-cadherin structure corresponds to the extracellular architecture of adherens junctions. In all three ectodomain crystals, cadherins dimerize through a trans adhesive interface and are connected by a second, cis, interface. Assemblies formed by E-cadherin ectodomains coated on liposomes also appear to adopt this structure. Fluorescent imaging of junctions formed from wild-type and mutant E-cadherins in cultured cells confirm conclusions derived from structural evidence. Mutations that interfere with the trans interface ablate adhesion, whereas cis interface mutations disrupt stable junction formation. Our observations are consistent with a model for junction assembly involving strong trans and weak cis interactions localized in the ectodomain.",

        "Abstract": "Vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), a divergent member of the type II classical cadherin family of cell adhesion proteins, mediates homophilic adhesion in the vascular endothelium. Previous investigations with a bacterially produced protein suggested that VE-cadherin forms cell surface trimers that bind between apposed cells to form hexamers. Here we report studies of mammalian-produced VE-cadherin ectodomains suggesting that, like other classical cadherins, VE-cadherin forms adhesive trans dimers between monomers located on opposing cell surfaces. Trimerization of the bacterially produced protein appears to be an artifact that arises from a lack of glycosylation. We also present the 2.1-\u00c5-resolution crystal structure of the VE-cadherin EC1-2 adhesive region, which reveals homodimerization via the strand-swap mechanism common to classical cadherins. In common with type II cadherins, strand-swap binding involves two tryptophan anchor residues, but the adhesive interface resembles type I cadherins in that VE-cadherin does not form a large nonswapped hydrophobic surface. Thus, VE-cadherin is an outlier among classical cadherins, with characteristics of both type I and type II subfamilies.",

        "Abstract": "All members of the kinesin superfamily of molecular motors contain an unusual structural motif consisting of an \u03b1-helix that is interrupted by a flexible loop, referred to as L5. We have examined the function of L5 in the mitotic kinesin Eg5 by combining site-directed mutagenesis of L5 with transient state kinetics, molecular dynamics simulations, and docking using cryo electron microscopy density. We find that mutation of a proline residue located at a turn within this loop profoundly slows nucleotide-induced structural changes both at the catalytic site as well as at the microtubule binding domain and the neck linker. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that this mutation affects the dynamics not only of L5 itself but also of the switch I structural elements that sense ATP binding to the catalytic site. Our results lead us to propose that L5 regulates the rate of conformational change in key elements of the nucleotide binding site through its interactions with \u03b13 and in so doing controls the speed of movement and force generation in kinesin motors.",

        "Abstract": "Intercellullar junctions formed by cadherins, including desmosomes and adherens junctions, comprise two dimensional arrays of \"trans\" dimers formed between monomers emanating from opposing cell surfaces. Lateral \"cis\" interfaces between cadherins from the same cell surface have been proposed to play a role in cadherin clustering. Although the molecular details of cis interactions remain uncertain, they must define an anisotropic arrangement where binding is favorable only in certain orientations. Here we report Monte Carlo simulations performed on a 2D lattice constructed to account for the anisotropy in cadherin cis interactions. A crucial finding is that the \"phase transition\" between freely diffusing cadherin monomers and dimers and a condensed ordered 2D junction formed by dimers alone is a cooperative process involving both trans and cis interactions. Moreover, cis interactions, despite being too weak to be measured in solution, are critical to the formation of an ordered junction structure. We discuss these results in light of available experimental information on cadherin binding free energies that are transformed from their bulk solution values to interaction energies on a 2D lattice.",

        "Abstract": "Many algorithms that compare protein structures can reveal similarities that suggest related biological functions, even at great evolutionary distances. Proteins with related function often exhibit differences in binding specificity, but few algorithms identify structural variations that effect specificity. To address this problem, we describe the Volumetric Analysis of Surface Properties (VASP), a novel volumetric analysis tool for the comparison of binding sites in aligned protein structures. VASP uses solid volumes to represent protein shape and the shape of surface cavities, clefts and tunnels that are defined with other methods. Our approach, inspired by techniques from constructive solid geometry, enables the isolation of volumetrically conserved and variable regions within three dimensionally superposed volumes. We applied VASP to compute a comparative volumetric analysis of the ligand binding sites formed by members of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer (START) domains and the serine proteases. Within both families, VASP isolated individual amino acids that create structural differences between ligand binding cavities that are known to influence differences in binding specificity. Also, VASP isolated cavity subregions that differ between ligand binding cavities which are essential for differences in binding specificity. As such, VASP should prove a valuable tool in the study of protein-ligand binding specificity.",

The presence of the NL1 B splice insertion lowers beta-NRX binding affinity by approximately 2-fold, while beta-NRX splice insertion 4 has small effects that do not synergize with NL splicing. New structures of glycosylated beta-NRXs 1 and 2 containing splice insertion 4 reveal that the insertion forms a new beta strand that replaces the beta10 strand, leaving the NL binding site intact. This helps to explain the limited effect of splice insert 4 on NRX/NL binding affinities. These results provide new structural insights and quantitative binding information to help determine whether and how splice isoform choice plays a role in beta-NRX/NL-mediated synaptic recognition.",

        "Abstract": "With the advent of Systems Biology, the prediction of whether two proteins form a complex has become a problem of increased importance. A variety of experimental techniques have been applied to the problem, but three-dimensional structural information has not been widely exploited. Here we explore the range of applicability of such information by analyzing the extent to which the location of binding sites on protein surfaces is conserved among structural neighbors. We find, as expected, that interface conservation is most significant among proteins that have a clear evolutionary relationship, but that there is a significant level of conservation even among remote structural neighbors. This finding is consistent with recent evidence that information available from structural neighbors, independent of classification, should be exploited in the search for functional insights. The value of such structural information is highlighted through the development of a new protein interface prediction method, PredUs, that identifies what residues on protein surfaces are likely to participate in complexes with other proteins. The performance of PredUs, as measured through comparisons with other methods, suggests that relationships across protein structure space can be successfully exploited in the prediction of protein-protein interactions.",

Functional information can be especially important in guiding the modeling process, but such information is not generally integrated into modeling pipelines.

        "Abstract": "SkyLine, a high-throughput homology modeling pipeline tool, detects and models true sequence homologs to a given protein structure. Structures and models are stored in SkyBase with links to computational function annotation, as calculated by MarkUs. The SkyLine/SkyBase/MarkUs technology represents a novel structure-based approach that is more objective and versatile than other protein classification resources. This structure-centric strategy provides a multi-dimensional organization and coverage of protein space at the levels of family, function, and genome. The concept of \"modelability\", the ability to model sequences on related structures, provides a reliable criterion for membership in a protein family (\"leverage\") and underlies the unique success of this approach. The overall procedure is illustrated by its application to START domains, which comprise a Biomedical Theme for the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium as part of the Protein Structure Initiative. START domains are typically involved in the non-vesicular transport of lipids. While 19 experimentally determined structures are available, the family, whose evolutionary hierarchy is not well determined, is highly sequence diverse, and the ligand-binding potential of many family members is unknown. The SkyLine/SkyBase/MarkUs approach provides significant insights and predicts: (1) many more family members (approximately 4,000) than any other resource; (2) the function for a large number of unannotated proteins; (3) instances of START domains in genomes from which they were thought to be absent; and (4) the existence of two types of novel proteins, those containing dual START domain and those containing N-terminal START domains.",

Here we present high-resolution crystal structures of complexes between p53 core-domain tetramers and DNA targets consisting of contiguous half-sites. In contrast to previously reported p53-DNA complexes that show standard Watson-Crick base pairs, the newly reported structures show noncanonical Hoogsteen base-pairing geometry at the central A-T doublet of each half-site. Structural and computational analyses show that the Hoogsteen geometry distinctly modulates the B-DNA helix in terms of local shape and electrostatic potential, which, together with the contiguous DNA configuration, results in enhanced protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions compared to noncontiguous half-sites. Our results suggest a mechanism relating spacer length to protein-DNA binding affinity. Our findings also expand the current understanding of protein-DNA recognition and establish the structural and chemical properties of Hoogsteen base pairs as the basis for a novel mode of sequence readout.",

        "Abstract": "Specific interactions between proteins and DNA are fundamental to many biological processes. In this review, we provide a revised view of protein-DNA interactions that emphasizes the importance of the three-dimensional structures of both macromolecules. We divide protein-DNA interactions into two categories: those when the protein recognizes the unique chemical signatures of the DNA bases (base readout) and those when the protein recognizes a sequence-dependent DNA shape (shape readout). We further divide base readout into those interactions that occur in the major groove from those that occur in the minor groove. Analogously, the readout of the DNA shape is subdivided into global shape recognition (for example, when the DNA helix exhibits an overall bend) and local shape recognition (for example, when a base pair step is kinked or a region of the minor groove is narrow). Based on the >1500 structures of protein-DNA complexes now available in the Protein Data Bank, we argue that individual DNA-binding proteins combine multiple readout mechanisms to achieve DNA-binding specificity. Specificity that distinguishes between families frequently involves base readout in the major groove, whereas shape readout is often exploited for higher resolution specificity, to distinguish between members within the same DNA-binding protein family.",

The nucleosome offers a prominent example of a shape readout mechanism where arginines insert into narrow minor groove regions that face the histone core. Here we compare DNA shape and arginine recognition of three nucleosome core particle structures, expanding on our previous study by characterizing two additional structures, one with a different protein sequence and one with a different DNA sequence. The electrostatic potential in the minor groove is shown to be largely independent of the underlying sequence but is, however, dominated by groove geometry. Our results extend and generalize our previous observation that the interaction of arginines with narrow minor grooves plays an important role in stabilizing the deformed DNA in the nucleosome.",

Adhesion by classical cadherins depends on binding interactions in their N-terminal EC1 domains, which swap N-terminal beta-strands between partner molecules from apposing cells. However, strand-swapping sequence signatures are absent from nonclassical cadherins, raising the question of how these proteins function in adhesion. Here, we show that T-cadherin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cadherin, forms dimers through an alternative nonswapped interface near the EC1-EC2 calcium-binding sites. Mutations within this interface ablate the adhesive capacity of T-cadherin. These nonadhesive T-cadherin mutants also lose the ability to regulate neurite outgrowth from T-cadherin-expressing neurons. Our findings reveal the likely molecular architecture of the T-cadherin homophilic interface and its requirement for axon outgrowth regulation. The adhesive binding mode used by T-cadherin may also be used by other nonclassical cadherins.",

        "Abstract": "Crystal structures of classical cadherins have revealed two dimeric configurations. In the first, N-terminal beta-strands of EC1 domains 'swap' between partner molecules. The second configuration (the 'X dimer'), also observed for T-cadherin, is mediated by residues near the EC1-EC2 calcium binding sites, and N-terminal beta-strands of partner EC1 domains, though held adjacent, do not swap. Here we show that strand-swapping mutants of type I and II classical cadherins form X dimers. Mutant cadherins impaired for X-dimer formation show no binding in short-time frame surface plasmon resonance assays, but in long-time frame experiments, they have homophilic binding affinities close to that of wild type. Further experiments show that exchange between monomers and dimers is slowed in these mutants. These results reconcile apparently disparate results from prior structural studies and suggest that X dimers are binding intermediates that facilitate the formation of strand-swapped dimers.",

        "Abstract": "Automatic modeling methods using cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) density maps as constraints are promising approaches to building atomic models of individual proteins or protein domains. However, their application to large macromolecular assemblies has not been possible largely due to computational limitations inherent to such unsupervised methods. Here we describe a new method, EM-IMO (electron microscopy-iterative modular optimization), for building, modifying and refining local structures of protein models using cryoEM maps as a constraint. As a supervised refinement method, EM-IMO allows users to specify parameters derived from inspections so as to guide, and as a consequence, significantly speed up the refinement. An EM-IMO-based refinement protocol is first benchmarked on a data set of 50 homology models using simulated density maps. A multiscale refinement strategy that combines EM-IMO-based and molecular dynamics-based refinement is then applied to build backbone models for the seven conformers of the five capsid proteins in our near-atomic-resolution cryoEM map of the grass carp reovirus virion, a member of the Aquareovirus genus of the Reoviridae family. The refined models allow us to reconstruct a backbone model of the entire grass carp reovirus capsid and provide valuable functional insights that are described in the accompanying publication [Cheng, L., Zhu, J., Hui, W. H., Zhang, X., Honig, B., Fang, Q. & Zhou, Z. H. (2010). Backbone model of an aquareovirus virion by cryo-electron microscopy and bioinformatics. J. Mol. Biol. (this issue). doi:10.1016/j.jmb.2009.12.027.]. Our study demonstrates that the integrated use of homology modeling and a multiscale refinement protocol that combines supervised and automated structure refinement offers a practical strategy for building atomic models based on medium- to high-resolution cryoEM density maps.",

        "Abstract": "Grass carp reovirus (GCRV) is a member of the aquareovirus genus in the Reoviridae family and has a capsid with two shells-a transcription-competent core surrounded by a coat. We report a near-atomic-resolution reconstruction of the GCRV virion by cryo-electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction. A backbone model of the GCRV virion, including seven conformers of the five capsid proteins making up the 1500 molecules in both the core and the coat, was derived using cryo-electron microscopy density-map-constrained homology modeling and refinement. Our structure clearly showed that the amino-terminal segment of core protein VP3B forms an approximately 120-A-long alpha-helix-rich extension bridging across the icosahedral 2-fold-symmetry-related molecular interface. The presence of this unique structure across this interface and the lack of an external cementing molecule at this location in GCRV suggest a stabilizing role of this extended amino-terminal density. Moreover, part of this amino-terminal extension becomes invisible in the reconstruction of transcription-competent core particles, suggesting its involvement in endogenous viral RNA transcription. Our structure of the VP1 turret represents its open state, and comparison with its related structures at the closed state suggests hinge-like domain movements associated with the mRNA-capping machinery. Overall, this first backbone model of an aquareovirus virion provides a wealth of structural information for understanding the structural basis of GCRV assembly and transcription.",

        "Abstract": "The recognition of specific DNA sequences by proteins is thought to depend on two types of mechanism: one that involves the formation of hydrogen bonds with specific bases, primarily in the major groove, and one involving sequence-dependent deformations of the DNA helix. By comprehensively analysing the three-dimensional structures of protein-DNA complexes, here we show that the binding of arginine residues to narrow minor grooves is a widely used mode for protein-DNA recognition. This readout mechanism exploits the phenomenon that narrow minor grooves strongly enhance the negative electrostatic potential of the DNA. The nucleosome core particle offers a prominent example of this effect. Minor-groove narrowing is often associated with the presence of A-tracts, AT-rich sequences that exclude the flexible TpA step. These findings indicate that the ability to detect local variations in DNA shape and electrostatic potential is a general mechanism that enables proteins to use information in the minor groove, which otherwise offers few opportunities for the formation of base-specific hydrogen bonds, to achieve DNA-binding specificity.",

        "Abstract": "It has become increasingly apparent that geometric relationships often exist between regions of two proteins that have quite different global topologies or folds. In this article, we examine whether such relationships can be used to infer a functional connection between the two proteins in question. We find, by considering a number of examples involving metal and cation binding, sugar binding, and aromatic group binding, that geometrically similar protein fragments can share related functions, even if they have been classified as belonging to different folds and topologies. Thus, the use of classifications inevitably limits the number of functional inferences that can be obtained from the comparative analysis of protein structures. In contrast, the development of interactive computational tools that recognize the \"continuous\" nature of protein structure/function space, by increasing the number of potentially meaningful relationships that are considered, may offer a dramatic enhancement in the ability to extract information from protein structure databases. We introduce the MarkUs server, that embodies this strategy and that is designed for a user interested in developing and validating specific functional hypotheses.",

        "Title": "Linking molecular affinity and cellular specificity in cadherin-mediated adhesion.",
        "Abstract": "Many cell-cell adhesive events are mediated by the dimerization of cadherin proteins presented on apposing cell surfaces. Cadherin-mediated processes play a central role in the sorting of cells into separate tissues in vivo, but in vitro assays aimed at mimicking this behavior have yielded inconclusive results. In some cases, cells that express different cadherins exhibit homotypic cell sorting, forming separate cell aggregates, whereas in other cases, intermixed aggregates are formed. A third pattern is observed for mixtures of cells expressing either N- or E-cadherin, which form distinct homotypic aggregates that adhere to one another through a heterotypic interface. The molecular basis of cadherin-mediated cell patterning phenomena is poorly understood, in part because the relationship between cellular adhesive specificity and intermolecular binding free energies has not been established. To clarify this issue, we have measured the dimerization affinities of N-cadherin and E-cadherin. These proteins are similar in sequence and structure, yet are able to mediate homotypic cell patterning behavior in a variety of tissues. N-cadherin is found to form homodimers with higher affinity than does E-cadherin and, unexpectedly, the N/E-cadherin heterophilic binding affinity is intermediate in strength between the 2 homophilic affinities. We can account for observed cell aggregation behaviors by using a theoretical framework that establishes a connection between molecular affinities and cell-cell adhesive specificity. Our results illustrate how graded differences between different homophilic and heterophilic cadherin dimerizaton affinities can result in homotypic cell patterning and, more generally, show how proteins that are closely related can, nevertheless, be responsible for highly specific cellular adhesive behavior.",

Molecular simulations have also been applied to the prediction of transcription factor binding sites, while empirical approaches have been developed to predict nucleosome positioning. Studies that combine and integrate experimental, statistical and computational data offer the promise of rapid advances in our understanding of protein-DNA recognition mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "The current nonredundant protein sequence database contains over seven million entries and the number of individual functional domains is significantly larger than this value. The vast quantity of data associated with these proteins poses enormous challenges to any attempt at function annotation. Classification of proteins into sequence and structural groups has been widely used as an approach to simplifying the problem. In this article we question such strategies. We describe how the multifunctionality and structural diversity of even closely related proteins confounds efforts to assign function on the basis of overall sequence or structural similarity. Rather, we suggest that strategies that avoid classification may offer a more robust approach to protein function annotation.",

        "Abstract": "The heterotrimeric G protein transducin is a key component of the vertebrate phototransduction cascade. Transducin is peripherally attached to membranes of the rod outer segment, where it interacts with other proteins at the membrane-cytosol interface. However, upon sustained activation by light, the dissociated G(t)alpha and Gbeta(1)gamma(1) subunits of transducin translocate from the outer segment to other parts of the rod cell. Here we used a computational approach to analyze the interaction strength of transducin and its subunits with acidic lipid bilayers, as well as the range of orientations that they are allowed to occupy on the membrane surface. Our results suggest that the combined constraints of electrostatics and lipid anchors substantially limit the rotational degrees of freedom of the membrane-bound transducin heterotrimer. This may contribute to a faster transducin activation rate by accelerating transducin-rhodopsin complex formation. Notably, the membrane interactions of the dissociated transducin subunits are very different from those of the heterotrimer. As shown previously, Gbeta(1)gamma(1) experiences significant attractive interactions with negatively charged membranes, whereas our new results suggest that G(t)alpha is electrostatically repelled by such membranes. We suggest that this repulsion could facilitate the membrane dissociation and intracellular translocation of G(t)alpha. Moreover, based on similarities in sequence and electrostatic properties, we propose that the properties described for transducin are common to its homologs within the G(i) subfamily. In a broader view, this work exemplifies how the activity-dependent association and dissociation of a G protein can change both the affinity for membranes and the range of allowed orientations, thereby modulating G protein function.",

        "Abstract": "Cadherin-mediated cell adhesion is achieved through dimerization of cadherin N-terminal extracellular (EC1) domains presented from apposed cells. The dimer state is formed by exchange of N-terminal beta strands and insertion of conserved tryptophan indole side chains from one monomer into hydrophobic acceptor pockets of the partner molecule. The present work characterizes individual monomer and dimer states and the monomer-dimer equilibrium of the mouse Type II cadherin-8 EC1 domain using NMR spectroscopy. Limited picosecond-to-nanosecond timescale dynamics of the tryptophan indole moieties for both monomer and dimer states are consistent with well-ordered packing of the N-terminal beta strands intramolecularly and intermolecularly, respectively. However, pronounced microsecond-to-millisecond timescale dynamics of the side chains are observed for the monomer but not the dimer state, suggesting that monomers transiently sample configurations in which the indole moieties are exposed. The results suggest possible kinetic mechanisms for EC1 dimerization.",

        "Title": "Mechanism for alternating access in neurotransmitter transporters.",
        "Abstract": "Crystal structures of LeuT, a bacterial homologue of mammalian neurotransmitter transporters, show a molecule of bound substrate that is essentially exposed to the extracellular space but occluded from the cytoplasm. Thus, there must exist an alternate conformation for LeuT in which the substrate is accessible to the cytoplasm and a corresponding mechanism that switches accessibility from one side of the membrane to the other. Here, we identify the cytoplasmic accessibility pathway of the alternate conformation in a mammalian serotonin transporter (SERT) (a member of the same transporter family as LeuT). We also propose a model for the cytoplasmic-facing state that exploits the internal pseudosymmetry observed in the crystal structure. LeuT contains two structurally similar repeats (TMs1-5 and TMs 6-10) that are inverted with respect to the plane of the membrane. The conformational differences between them result in the formation of the extracellular pathway. Our model for the cytoplasm-facing state exchanges the conformations of the two repeats and thus exposes the substrate and ion-binding sites to the cytoplasm. The conformational change that connects the two states primarily involves the tilting of a 4-helix bundle composed of transmembrane helices 1, 2, 6, and 7. Switching the tilt angle of this bundle is essentially equivalent to switching the conformation of the two repeats. Extensive mutagenesis of SERT and accessibility measurements, using cysteine reagents, are accommodated by our model. These observations may be of relevance to other transporter families, many of which contain internal inverted repeats.",

        "Abstract": "Cadherins are cell surface adhesion proteins important for tissue development and integrity. Type I and type II, or classical, cadherins form adhesive dimers via an interface formed through the exchange, or \"swapping\", of the N-terminal beta-strands from their membrane-distal EC1 domains. Here, we ask which sequence and structural features in EC1 domains are responsible for beta-strand swapping and whether members of other cadherin families form similar strand-swapped binding interfaces. We created a comprehensive database of multiple alignments of each type of cadherin domain. We used the known three-dimensional structures of classical cadherins to identify conserved positions in multiple sequence alignments that appear to be crucial determinants of the cadherin domain structure. We identified features that are unique to EC1 domains. On the basis of our analysis, we conclude that all cadherin domains have very similar overall folds but, with the exception of classical and desmosomal cadherin EC1 domains, most of them do not appear to bind through a strand-swapping mechanism. Thus, non-classical cadherins that function in adhesion are likely to use different protein-protein interaction interfaces. Our results have implications for the evolution of molecular mechanisms of cadherin-mediated adhesion in vertebrates.",

        "Abstract": "A protocol is presented for the global refinement of homology models of proteins. It combines the advantages of temperature-based replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) for conformational sampling and the use of statistical potentials for model selection. The protocol was tested using 21 models. Of these 14 were models of 10 small proteins for which high-resolution crystal structures were available, the remainder were targets of the recent CASPR exercise. It was found that REMD in combination with currently available force fields could sample near-native conformational states starting from high-quality homology models. Conformations in which the backbone RMSD of secondary structure elements (SSE-RMSD) was lower than the starting value by 0.5-1.0 A were found for 15 out of the 21 cases (average 0.82 A). Furthermore, when a simple scoring function consisting of two statistical potentials was used to rank the structures, one or more structures with SSE-RMSD of at least 0.2 A lower than the starting value was found among the five best ranked structures in 11 out of the 21 cases. The average improvement in SSE-RMSD for the best models was 0.42 A. However, none of the scoring functions tested identified the structures with the lowest SSE-RMSD as the best models although all identified the native conformation as the one with lowest energy. This suggests that while the proposed protocol proved effective for the refinement of high-quality models of small proteins scoring functions remain one of the major limiting factors in structure refinement. This and other aspects by which the methodology could be further improved are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Presynaptic neurexins (NRXs) bind to postsynaptic neuroligins (NLs) to form Ca(2+)-dependent complexes that bridge neural synapses. beta-NRXs bind NLs through their LNS domains, which contain a single site of alternative splicing (splice site 4) giving rise to two isoforms: +4 and Delta. We present crystal structures of the Delta isoforms of the LNS domains from beta-NRX1 and beta-NRX2, crystallized in the presence of Ca(2+) ions. The Ca(2+)-binding site is disordered in the beta-NRX2 structure, but the 1.7 A beta-NRX1 structure reveals a single Ca(2+) ion, approximately 12 A from the splice insertion site, with one coordinating ligand donated by a glutamic acid from an adjacent beta-NRX1 molecule. NMR studies of beta-NRX1+4 show that the insertion sequence is unstructured, and remains at least partially disordered in complex with NL. These results raise the possibility that beta-NRX insertion sequence 4 may function in roles independent of neuroligin binding.",

        "Abstract": "Neuroligins (NLs) are catalytically inactive members of a family of cholinesterase-like transmembrane proteins that mediate cell adhesion at neuronal synapses. Postsynaptic neuroligins engage in Ca2+-dependent transsynaptic interactions via their extracellular cholinesterase domain with presynaptic neurexins (NRXs). These interactions may be regulated by two short splice insertions (termed A and B) in the NL cholinesterase domain. Here, we present the 3.3-A crystal structure of the ectodomain from NL2 containing splice insertion A (NL2A). The overall structure of NL2A resembles that of cholinesterases, but several structural features are unique to the NL proteins. First, structural elements surrounding the esterase active-site region differ significantly between active esterases and NL2A. On the opposite surface of the NL2A molecule, the positions of the A and B splice insertions identify a candidate NRX interaction site of the NL protein. Finally, sequence comparisons of NL isoforms allow for mapping the location of residues of previously identified mutations in NL3 and NL4 found in patients with autism spectrum disorders. Overall, the NL2 structure promises to provide a valuable model for dissecting NL isoform- and synapse-specific functions.",

        "Abstract": "The recognition of specific DNA-binding sites by transcription factors is a critical yet poorly understood step in the control of gene expression. Members of the Hox family of transcription factors bind DNA by making nearly identical major groove contacts via the recognition helices of their homeodomains. In vivo specificity, however, often depends on extended and unstructured regions that link Hox homeodomains to a DNA-bound cofactor, Extradenticle (Exd). Using a combination of structure determination, computational analysis, and in vitro and in vivo assays, we show that Hox proteins recognize specific Hox-Exd binding sites via residues located in these extended regions that insert into the minor groove but only when presented with the correct DNA sequence. Our results suggest that these residues, which are conserved in a paralog-specific manner, confer specificity by recognizing a sequence-dependent DNA structure instead of directly reading a specific DNA sequence.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a fast and accurate protocol, LoopBuilder, for the prediction of loop conformations in proteins. The procedure includes extensive sampling of backbone conformations, side chain addition, the use of a statistical potential to select a subset of these conformations, and, finally, an energy minimization and ranking with an all-atom force field. We find that the Direct Tweak algorithm used in the previously developed LOOPY program is successful in generating an ensemble of conformations that on average are closer to the native conformation than those generated by other methods. An important feature of Direct Tweak is that it checks for interactions between the loop and the rest of the protein during the loop closure process. DFIRE is found to be a particularly effective statistical potential that can bias conformation space toward conformations that are close to the native structure. Its application as a filter prior to a full molecular mechanics energy minimization both improves prediction accuracy and offers a significant savings in computer time. Final scoring is based on the OPLS/SBG-NP force field implemented in the PLOP program. The approach is also shown to be quite successful in predicting loop conformations for cases where the native side chain conformations are assumed to be unknown, suggesting that it will prove effective in real homology modeling applications.",

        "Abstract": "The recent determination of the crystal structure of the leucine transporter from Aquifex aeolicus (aaLeuT) has provided significant insights into the function of neurotransmitter:sodium symporters. Transport by aaLeuT is Cl(-) independent, whereas many neurotransmitter:sodium symporters from higher organisms depend on Cl(-) ions. However, the only Cl(-) ion identified in the aaLeuT structure interacts with nonconserved residues in extracellular loops, and thus the relevance of this binding site is unclear. Here, we use calculations of pK(A)s and homology modeling to predict the location of a functionally important Cl(-) binding site in serotonin transporter and other Cl(-)-dependent transporters. We validate our model through the site-directed mutagenesis of residues predicted to coordinate the Cl(-) ion and through the observation of sequence conservation patterns in other Cl(-)-dependent transporters. The proposed site is located midway across the membrane and is formed by residues from transmembrane helices 2, 6, and 7. It is close to the Na1 sodium binding site, thus providing an explanation for the coupling of Cl(-) and Na(+) ions during transport. Other implications of the model are also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "In this study, we address the problem of local quality assessment in homology models. As a prerequisite for the evaluation of methods for predicting local model quality, we first examine the problem of measuring local structural similarities between a model and the corresponding native structure. Several local geometric similarity measures are evaluated. Two methods based on structural superposition are found to best reproduce local model quality assessments by human experts. We then examine the performance of state-of-the-art statistical potentials in predicting local model quality on three qualitatively distinct data sets. The best statistical potential, DFIRE, is shown to perform on par with the best current structure-based method in the literature, ProQres. A combination of different statistical potentials and structural features using support vector machines is shown to provide somewhat improved performance over published methods.",

        "Abstract": "The functional annotation of the nonprotein-coding DNA of eukaryotic genomes is a problem of central importance. Phylogenetic footprinting methods, which attempt to identify functional regulatory regions by comparing orthologous genomic sequences of evolutionarily related species, have shown promising results. The main advantage of this class of approaches is that they do not require any knowledge of the regulating transcription factors. Here we describe a method called Enhancer Detection using only Genomic Information (EDGI), which integrates a traditional motif-discovery algorithm with a local permutation-clustering algorithm. Together, they can identify large regulatory elements (e.g., enhancers) as evolutionarily conserved order-independent clusters of short conserved motifs. We show that EDGI can distinguish between established sets of known enhancers and nonenhancers with 88% accuracy, rivaling predictions by methods that rely on the knowledge of the regulating transcription factors and their DNA-binding specificities. We tested EDGI's performance on a set of Drosophila genomes. Our results demonstrate that comparative genomic analysis of multiple closely related species has substantial power to identify key functional elements without additional biological knowledge.",

Here we use protein-DNA structures to predict binding specificity and consider the possibility of predicting position weight matrices (PWM) for an entire protein family based on the structures of just a few family members. A particular focus is the sensitivity of prediction accuracy to the docking geometry of the structure used. We investigate this issue with the goal of determining how similar two docking geometries must be for binding specificity predictions to be accurate. Docking similarity is quantified using our recently described interface alignment score (IAS). Using a molecular-mechanics force field, we predict high-affinity nucleotide sequences that bind to the second zinc-finger (ZF) domain from the Zif268 protein, using different C2H2 ZF domains as structural templates. We identify a strong relationship between IAS values and prediction accuracy, and define a range of IAS values for which accurate structure-based predictions of binding specificity is to be expected. The implication of our results for large-scale, structure-based prediction of PWMs is discussed.",

However, much less attention has been paid to the calculation of pK(a) shifts in RNA. There is accumulating evidence that protonated nucleotides can stabilize RNA structure and participate in enzyme catalysis within ribozymes. Here, we calculate the pK(a) shifts of nucleotides in RNA structures using numerical solutions to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. We find that significant shifts are predicted for several nucleotides in two catalytic RNAs, the hairpin ribozyme and the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme, and that the shifts are likely to be related to their functions. We explore how different structural environments shift the pK(a)s of nucleotides from their solution values. RNA structures appear to use two basic strategies to shift pK(a)s: (a) the formation of compact structural motifs with structurally-conserved, electrostatic interactions; and (b) the arrangement of the phosphodiester backbone to focus negative electrostatic potential in specific regions.",

        "Abstract": "The salt dependence of the binding free energy of five protein-protein hetero-dimers and two homo-dimers/tetramers was calculated from numerical solutions to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Overall, the agreement with experimental values is very good. In all cases except one involving the highly charged lactoglobulin homo-dimer, increasing the salt concentration is found both experimentally and theoretically to decrease the binding affinity. To clarify the source of salt effects, the salt-dependent free energy of binding is partitioned into screening terms and to self-energy terms that involve the interaction of the charge distribution of a monomer with its own ion atmosphere. In six of the seven complexes studied, screening makes the largest contribution but self-energy effects can also be significant. The calculated salt effects are found to be insensitive to force-field parameters and to the internal dielectric constant assigned to the monomers. Nonlinearities due to high charge densities, which are extremely important in the binding of proteins to negatively charged membrane surfaces and to nucleic acids, make much smaller contributions to the protein-protein complexes studied here, with the exception of highly charged lactoglobulin dimers. Our results indicate that the Poisson-Boltzmann equation captures much of the physical basis of the nonspecific salt dependence of protein-protein complexation.",

        "Abstract": "An approach is described that improves the prediction of the conformations of surface side chains in crystal structures, given the main-chain conformation of a protein. A key element of the methodology involves the use of the colony energy. This phenomenological term favors conformations found in frequently sampled regions, thereby approximating entropic effects and serving to smooth the potential energy surface. Use of the colony energy significantly improves prediction accuracy for surface side chains with little additional computational cost. Prediction accuracy was quantified as the percentage of side-chain dihedral angles predicted to be within 40 degrees of the angles measured by X-ray diffraction. Use of the colony energy in predictions for single side chains improved the prediction accuracy for chi(1) and chi(1+2) from 65 and 40% to 74 and 59%, respectively. Several other factors that affect prediction of surface side-chain conformations were also analyzed, including the extent of conformational sampling, details of the rotamer library employed, and accounting for the crystallographic environment. The prediction of conformations for polar residues on the surface was generally found to be more difficult than those for hydrophobic residues, except for polar residues participating in hydrogen bonds with other protein groups. For surface residues with hydrogen-bonded side chains, the prediction accuracy of chi(1) and chi(1+2) was 79 and 63%, respectively. For surface polar residues, in general (all side-chain prediction), the accuracy of chi(1) and chi(1+2) was only 73 and 56%, respectively. The most accurate results were obtained using the colony energy and an all-atom description that includes neighboring molecules in the crystal (protein chains and hetero atoms). Here, the accuracy of chi(1) and chi(1+2) predictions for surface side chains was 82 and 73%, respectively. The root mean square deviations obtained for hydrogen-bonding surface side chains were 1.64 and 1.81 A, with and without consideration of crystal packing effects, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "In this article, we present an iterative, modular optimization (IMO) protocol for the local structure refinement of protein segments containing secondary structure elements (SSEs). The protocol is based on three modules: a torsion-space local sampling algorithm, a knowledge-based potential, and a conformational clustering algorithm. Alternative methods are tested for each module in the protocol. For each segment, random initial conformations were constructed by perturbing the native dihedral angles of loops (and SSEs) of the segment to be refined while keeping the protein body fixed. Two refinement procedures based on molecular mechanics force fields - using either energy minimization or molecular dynamics - were also tested but were found to be less successful than the IMO protocol. We found that DFIRE is a particularly effective knowledge-based potential and that clustering algorithms that are biased by the DFIRE energies improve the overall results. Results were further improved by adding an energy minimization step to the conformations generated with the IMO procedure, suggesting that hybrid strategies that combine both knowledge-based and physical effective energy functions may prove to be particularly effective in future applications.",

        "Abstract": "Gene regulatory networks that control the terminally differentiated state of a cell are, by and large, only superficially understood. In a mutant screen aimed at identifying regulators of gene batteries that define the differentiated state of two left/right asymmetric C. elegans gustatory neurons, ASEL and ASER, we have isolated a mutant, fozi-1, with a novel mixed-fate phenotype, characterized by de-repression of ASEL fate in ASER. fozi-1 codes for a protein that functions in the nucleus of ASER to inhibit the expression of the LIM homeobox gene lim-6, neuropeptide-encoding genes and putative chemoreceptors of the GCY gene family. The FOZI-1 protein displays a highly unusual domain architecture, that combines two functionally essential C2H2 zinc-finger domains, which are probably involved in transcriptional regulation, with a formin homology 2 (FH2) domain, normally found only in cytosolic regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. We demonstrate that the FH2 domain of FOZI-1 has lost its actin polymerization function but maintains its phylogenetically ancient ability to homodimerize. fozi-1 genetically interacts with several transcription factors and micro RNAs in the context of specific regulatory network motifs. These network motifs endow the system with properties that provide insights into how cells adopt their stable terminally differentiated states.",

        "Title": "Comparative study of generalized born models: Born radii and peptide folding.",
        "Abstract": "In this study, we have implemented four analytical generalized Born (GB) models and investigated their performance in conjunction with the GROMOS96 force field. The four models include that of Still and co-workers, the HCT model of Cramer, Truhlar, and co-workers, a modified form of the AGB model of Levy and co-workers, and the GBMV2 model of Brooks and co-workers. The models were coded independently and implemented in the GROMOS software package and in TINKER. They were compared in terms of their ability to reproduce the results of Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) calculations and in their performance in the ab initio peptide folding of two peptides, one that forms a beta-hairpin in solution and one that forms an alpha-helix. In agreement with previous work, the GBMV2 model is most successful in reproducing PB results while the other models tend to underestimate the effective Born radii of buried atoms. In contrast, stochastic dynamics simulations on the folding of the two peptides, the C-terminus beta-hairpin of the B1 domain of protein G and the alanine-based alpha-helical peptide 3K(I), suggest that the simpler GB models are more effective in sampling conformational space. Indeed, the Still model used in conjunction with the GROMOS96 force field is able to fold the hairpin peptide to a native-like structure without the benefit of enhanced sampling techniques. This is due in part to the properties of the united-atom GROMOS96 force field which appears to be more flexible, and hence to sample more efficiently, than force fields such as OPLSAA. Our results suggest a general strategy which involves using different combinations of force fields and solvent models in different applications, for example, using GROMOS96 and a simple GB model in sampling and OPLSAA and a more accurate GB model in refinement. The fact that various methods have been implemented in a unified way should facilitate the testing and subsequent use of different methods to evaluate conformational free energies in different applications. Our results also bear on some general issues involved in peptide folding and structure prediction which are addressed in the Discussion.",

        "Abstract": "The identification of geometric relationships between protein structures offers a powerful approach to predicting the structure and function of proteins. Methods to detect such relationships range from human pattern recognition to a variety of mathematical algorithms. A number of schemes for the classification of protein structure have found widespread use and these implicitly assume the organization of protein structure space into discrete categories. Recently, an alternative view has emerged in which protein fold space is seen as continuous and multidimensional. Significant relationships have been observed between proteins that belong to what have been termed different 'folds'. There has been progress in the use of these relationships in the prediction of protein structure and function.",

        "Abstract": "In this study, we investigate the extent to which techniques for homology modeling that were developed for water-soluble proteins are appropriate for membrane proteins as well. To this end we present an assessment of current strategies for homology modeling of membrane proteins and introduce a benchmark data set of homologous membrane protein structures, called HOMEP. First, we use HOMEP to reveal the relationship between sequence identity and structural similarity in membrane proteins. This analysis indicates that homology modeling is at least as applicable to membrane proteins as it is to water-soluble proteins and that acceptable models (with C alpha-RMSD values to the native of 2 A or less in the transmembrane regions) may be obtained for template sequence identities of 30% or higher if an accurate alignment of the sequences is used. Second, we show that secondary-structure prediction algorithms that were developed for water-soluble proteins perform approximately as well for membrane proteins. Third, we provide a comparison of a set of commonly used sequence alignment algorithms as applied to membrane proteins. We find that high-accuracy alignments of membrane protein sequences can be obtained using state-of-the-art profile-to-profile methods that were developed for water-soluble proteins. Improvements are observed when weights derived from the secondary structure of the query and the template are used in the scoring of the alignment, a result which relies on the accuracy of the secondary-structure prediction of the query sequence. The most accurate alignments were obtained using template profiles constructed with the aid of structural alignments. In contrast, a simple sequence-to-sequence alignment algorithm, using a membrane protein-specific substitution matrix, shows no improvement in alignment accuracy. We suggest that profile-to-profile alignment methods should be adopted to maximize the accuracy of homology models of membrane proteins.",

Crystal-structure determination of ectodomain regions from three type II cadherins reveals adhesive dimers formed by exchange of N-terminal beta strands between partner extracellular cadherin-1 (EC1) domains. These interfaces have two conserved tryptophan side chains that anchor each swapped strand, compared with one in type I cadherins, and include large hydrophobic regions unique to type II interfaces. The EC1 domains of type I and type II cadherins appear to encode cell adhesive specificity in vitro. Moreover, perturbation of motor neuron segregation with chimeric cadherins depends on EC1 domain identity, suggesting that this region, which includes the structurally defined adhesive interface, encodes type II cadherin functional specificity in vivo.",

        "Title": "Searching for neuronal left/right asymmetry: genomewide analysis of nematode receptor-type guanylyl cyclases.",
        "Abstract": "Functional left/right asymmetry (\"laterality\") is a fundamental feature of many nervous systems, but only very few molecular correlates to functional laterality are known. At least two classes of chemosensory neurons in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans are functionally lateralized. The gustatory neurons ASE left (ASEL) and ASE right (ASER) are two bilaterally symmetric neurons that sense distinct chemosensory cues and express a distinct set of four known chemoreceptors of the guanylyl cyclase (gcy) gene family. To examine the extent of lateralization of gcy gene expression patterns in the ASE neurons, we have undertaken a genomewide analysis of all gcy genes. We report the existence of a total of 27 gcy genes encoding receptor-type guanylyl cyclases and of 7 gcy genes encoding soluble guanylyl cyclases in the complete genome sequence of C. elegans. We describe the expression pattern of all previously uncharacterized receptor-type guanylyl cyclases and find them to be highly biased but not exclusively restricted to the nervous system. We find that >41% (11/27) of all receptor-type guanylyl cyclases are expressed in the ASE gustatory neurons and that one-third of all gcy genes (9/27) are expressed in a lateral, left/right asymmetric manner in the ASE neurons. The expression of all laterally expressed gcy genes is under the control of a gene regulatory network composed of several transcription factors and miRNAs. The complement of gcy genes in the related nematode C. briggsae differs from C. elegans as evidenced by differences in chromosomal localization, number of gcy genes, and expression patterns. Differences in gcy expression patterns in the ASE neurons of C. briggsae arise from a difference in cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors that control ASE laterality. In sum, our results indicate the existence of a surprising multitude of putative chemoreceptors in the gustatory ASE neurons and suggest the existence of a substantial degree of laterality in gustatory signaling mechanisms in nematodes.",

        "Abstract": "In this article we introduce a new method for the identification and the accurate characterization of protein surface cavities. The method is encoded in the program SCREEN (Surface Cavity REcognition and EvaluatioN). As a first test of the utility of our approach we used SCREEN to locate and analyze the surface cavities of a nonredundant set of 99 proteins cocrystallized with drugs. We find that this set of proteins has on average about 14 distinct cavities per protein. In all cases, a drug is bound at one (and sometimes more than one) of these cavities. Using cavity size alone as a criterion for predicting drug-binding sites yields a high balanced error rate of 15.7%, with only 71.7% coverage. Here we characterize each surface cavity by computing a comprehensive set of 408 physicochemical, structural, and geometric attributes. By applying modern machine learning techniques (Random Forests) we were able to develop a classifier that can identify drug-binding cavities with a balanced error rate of 7.2% and coverage of 88.9%. Only 18 of the 408 cavity attributes had a statistically significant role in the prediction. Of these 18 important attributes, almost all involved size and shape rather than physicochemical properties of the surface cavity. The implications of these results are discussed. A SCREEN Web server is available at http://interface.bioc.columbia.edu/screen.",

        "Title": "Solution structure of Archaeglobus fulgidis peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth2) provides evidence for an extensive conserved family of Pth2 enzymes in archea, bacteria, and eukaryotes.",
        "Abstract": "The solution structure of protein AF2095 from the thermophilic archaea Archaeglobus fulgidis, a 123-residue (13.6-kDa) protein, has been determined by NMR methods. The structure of AF2095 is comprised of four alpha-helices and a mixed beta-sheet consisting of four parallel and anti-parallel beta-strands, where the alpha-helices sandwich the beta-sheet. Sequence and structural comparison of AF2095 with proteins from Homo sapiens, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, and Sulfolobus solfataricus reveals that AF2095 is a peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth2). This structural comparison also identifies putative catalytic residues and a tRNA interaction region for AF2095. The structure of AF2095 is also similar to the structure of protein TA0108 from archaea Thermoplasma acidophilum, which is deposited in the Protein Data Bank but not functionally annotated. The NMR structure of AF2095 has been further leveraged to obtain good-quality structural models for 55 other proteins. Although earlier studies have proposed that the Pth2 protein family is restricted to archeal and eukaryotic organisms, the similarity of the AF2095 structure to human Pth2, the conservation of key active-site residues, and the good quality of the resulting homology models demonstrate a large family of homologous Pth2 proteins that are conserved in eukaryotic, archaeal, and bacterial organisms, providing novel insights in the evolution of the Pth and Pth2 enzyme families.",

        "Abstract": "The matrix domain (MA) of Gag polyproteins performs multiple functions throughout the retroviral life cycle. MA structures have an electropositive surface patch that is implicated in membrane association. Here, we use computational methods to demonstrate that electrostatic control of membrane binding is a central characteristic of all retroviruses. We are able to explain a wide range of experimental observations and provide a level of quantitative and molecular detail that has been inaccessible to experiment. We further predict that MA may exist in a variety of oligomerization states and propose mechanistic models for the effects of phosphoinositides and phosphorylation. The calculations provide a conceptual model for how non-myristoylated and myristoylated MAs behave similarly in assembly and disassembly. Hence, they provide a unified quantitative picture of the structural and energetic origins of the entire range of MA function and thus enhance, extend, and integrate previous observations on individual stages of the process.",

        "Title": "An assessment of the accuracy of methods for predicting hydrogen positions in protein structures.",
        "Abstract": "The addition of hydrogen atoms to models or experimental structures of proteins that contain only non-hydrogen atoms is a common step in crystallographic structure refinement, in theoretical studies of proteins, and in protein structure prediction. Accurate prediction of the hydrogen positions is essential, since they constitute around half of the atoms in proteins and hence contribute significantly to their energetics. Many computational tools exist for predicting hydrogen positions, although to date no quantitative comparison has been made of their accuracy or efficiency. Here we take advantage of the recent increase in ultra-high-resolution X-ray crystal structures (< 0.9 A resolution), as well as of a number of relatively high-resolution neutron diffraction structures (< 1.8 A resolution), to compare the quality of the predictions generated by a large set of commonly used methods. These include CHARMM, CNS, GROMACS, MCCE, MolProbity, WHAT IF, and X-PLOR. The hydrogen atoms that lack a rotational degree of freedom are mostly, but not always, accurately predicted. For hydrogens with a rotational degree of freedom, all the methods give much less accurate predictions. The predictions for the hydroxyl hydrogens are analyzed in detail, particularly those buried within the protein, and some explanation is provided for the errors observed. The results provide a means to make informed decisions regarding the choice and implementation of methodologies for placing hydrogens on structures of proteins. They also point to shortcomings in current force fields and suggest the need for improved descriptions of hydrogen bonding energetics.",

        "Title": "Specificity of cell-cell adhesion by classical cadherins: Critical role for low-affinity dimerization through beta-strand swapping.",
        "Abstract": "Cadherins constitute a family of cell-surface proteins that mediate intercellular adhesion through the association of protomers presented from juxtaposed cells. Differential cadherin expression leads to highly specific intercellular interactions in vivo. This cell-cell specificity is difficult to understand at the molecular level because individual cadherins within a given subfamily are highly similar to each other both in sequence and structure, and they dimerize with remarkably low binding affinities. Here, we provide a molecular model that accounts for these apparently contradictory observations. The model is based in part on the fact that cadherins bind to one another by \"swapping\" the N-terminal beta-strands of their adhesive domains. An inherent feature of strand swapping (or, more generally, the domain swapping phenomenon) is that \"closed\" monomeric conformations act as competitive inhibitors of dimer formation, thus lowering affinities even when the dimer interface has the characteristics of high-affinity complexes. The model describes quantitatively how small affinity differences between low-affinity cadherin dimers are amplified by multiple cadherin interactions to establish large specificity effects at the cellular level. It is shown that cellular specificity would not be observed if cadherins bound with high affinities, thus emphasizing the crucial role of strand swapping in cell-cell adhesion. Numerical estimates demonstrate that the strength of cellular adhesion is extremely sensitive to the concentration of cadherins expressed at the cell surface. We suggest that the domain swapping mechanism is used by a variety of cell-adhesion proteins and that related mechanisms to control affinity and specificity are exploited in other systems.",

        "Abstract": "We show that reducing the activity of the Drosophila Runx protein Lozenge (Lz) during pupal development causes a decrease in cell death in the eye. We identified Lz-binding sites in introns of argos (aos) and klumpfuss (klu) and demonstrate that these genes are directly activated targets of Lz. Loss of either aos or klu reduces cell death, suggesting that Lz promotes apoptosis at least in part by regulating aos and klu. These results provide novel insights into the control of programmed cell death (PCD) by Lz during Drosophila eye development.",

        "Abstract": "In this work, we compare the results of molecular dynamics simulations involving the application of three generalized Born (GB) models to 10 different proteins. The three GB models, the Still, HCT, and modified analytical generalized Born models, were implemented in the computationally efficient gromacs package. The performance of each model was assessed from the backbone rms deviation from the native structure, the number of native hydrogen bonds retained in the simulation, and the experimental and calculated radius of gyration. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the results of the simulations. The rms deviation measure was found to be unable to distinguish the quality of the results obtained with the three different GB models, whereas the number of native hydrogen bonds and radius of gyration yielded a statistically meaningful discrimination among models. Our results suggest that, of the three, modified analytical generalized Born yields the best agreement between calculated and experimentally derived structures. More generally, our study highlights the need both to evaluate the effects of different variables on the results of simulations and to verify that the results of molecular dynamics simulations are statistically meaningful.",

        "Title": "Structural alignment of protein--DNA interfaces: insights into the determinants of binding specificity.",
        "Abstract": "A new method is introduced to structurally align interfaces observed in protein--DNA complexes. The method is based on a procedure that describes the interfacial geometry in terms of the spatial relationships between individual amino acid--nucleotide pairs. An amino acid--amino acid similarity matrix, S, is defined that provides a quantitative measure of the geometric relationships of amino acids in different interfaces and the entire stretch of \"local\" DNA within some distance of each amino acid. S is used as a substitution matrix in a dynamic programming algorithm that aligns the interfacial amino acids of the two complexes. The quality of the alignment is determined by an interface alignment score, IAS, that provides a quantitative measure of the similarity in the docking geometry between two protein--DNA complexes. We have clustered a large set of protein--DNA complexes based on their IAS values. In general, proteins within a single family form identifiable clusters. Subgroup clustering is often observed within families offering a fine-grained description of docking geometries. Although proteins with similar folds tend to dock in similar ways, important differences are observed even for structural motifs that almost perfectly align. Relationships are observed between the interfaces formed in cognate and non-cognate complexes involving the same proteins indicating a strong driving force to maintain certain contacts, even if this requires a distortion of the DNA. There are cases where inter-family similarities are greater than intra-family similarities. Our method offers the possibility of comparing different protein--DNA interfaces in a detailed, objective and quantitative fashion. This offers the possibility of new approaches to the description of the determinants of molecular recognition and to the prediction of protein and DNA sequence combinations that are optimal for binding.",

        "Abstract": "IscU is a highly conserved protein that serves as the scaffold for IscS-mediated assembly of iron-sulfur ([Fe-S]) clusters. We report the NMR solution structure of monomeric Haemophilus influenzae IscU with zinc bound at the [Fe-S] cluster assembly site. The compact core of the globular structure has an alpha-beta sandwich architecture with a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and four alpha-helices. A nascent helix is located N-terminal to the core structure. The zinc is ligated by three cysteine residues and one histidine residue that are located in and near conformationally dynamic loops at one end of the IscU structure. Removal of the zinc metal by chelation results in widespread loss of structure in the apo form. The zinc-bound IscU may be a good model for iron-loaded IscU and may demonstrate structural features found in the [Fe-S] cluster bound form. Structural and functional similarities, genomic context in operons containing other homologous genes, and distributions of conserved surface residues support the hypothesis that IscU protein domains are homologous (i.e. derived from a common ancestor) with the SufE/YgdK family of [Fe-S] cluster assembly proteins.",

        "Title": "The SufE sulfur-acceptor protein contains a conserved core structure that mediates interdomain interactions in a variety of redox protein complexes.",
        "Abstract": "The isc and suf operons in Escherichia coli represent alternative genetic systems optimized to mediate the essential metabolic process of iron-sulfur cluster (Fe-S) assembly under basal or oxidative-stress conditions, respectively. Some of the proteins in these two operons share strong sequence homology, e.g. the cysteine desulfurases IscS and SufS, and presumably play the same role in the oxygen-sensitive assembly process. However, other proteins in these operons share no significant homology and occur in a mutually exclusive manner in Fe-S assembly operons in other organisms (e.g. IscU and SufE). These latter proteins presumably play distinct roles adapted to the different assembly mechanisms used by the two systems. IscU has three invariant cysteine residues that function as a template for Fe-S assembly while accepting a sulfur atom from IscS. SufE, in contrast, does not function as an Fe-S assembly template but has been suggested to function as a shuttle protein that uses a persulfide linkage to a single invariant cysteine residue to transfer a sulfur atom from SufS to an alternative Fe-S assembly template. Here, we present and analyze the 2.0A crystal structure of E.coli SufE. The structure shows that the persulfide-forming cysteine occurs at the tip of a loop with elevated B-factors, where its side-chain is buried from solvent exposure in a hydrophobic cavity located beneath a highly conserved surface. Despite the lack of sequence homology, the core of SufE shows strong structural similarity to IscU, and the sulfur-acceptor site in SufE coincides with the location of the cysteine residues mediating Fe-S cluster assembly in IscU. Thus, a conserved core structure is implicated in mediating the interactions of both SufE and IscU with the mutually homologous cysteine desulfurase enzymes present in their respective operons. A similar core structure is observed in a domain found in a variety of Fe-S cluster containing flavoenzymes including xanthine dehydrogenase, where it also mediates interdomain interactions. Therefore, the core fold of SufE/IscU has been adapted to mediate interdomain interactions in diverse redox protein systems in the course of evolution.",

        "Title": "Helical packing patterns in membrane and soluble proteins.",
        "Abstract": "This article presents the results of a detailed analysis of helix-helix interactions in membrane and soluble proteins. A data set of interacting pairs of helices in membrane proteins of known structure was constructed and a structure alignment algorithm was used to identify pairs of helices in soluble proteins that superimpose well with pairs of helices in the membrane-protein data set. Most helix pairs in membrane proteins are found to have a significant number of structural homologs in soluble proteins, although in some cases, primarily involving irregular helices, no close homologs exist. An analysis of geometric relationships between interacting helices in the two sets of proteins identifies some differences in the distributions of helix length, interfacial area, packing angle, and distance between the polypeptide backbones. However, a subset of soluble-protein helix pairs that are close structural homologs to membrane-protein helix pairs exhibits distributions that mirror those observed in membrane proteins. The larger average interface size and smaller distance of closest approach seen for helices in membrane proteins appears due in part to a relative enrichment of alanines and glycines, particularly as components of the AxxxA and GxxxG motifs. It is argued that membrane helices are not on average more tightly packed than helices in soluble proteins; they are simply able to approach each other more closely. This enables them to interact over longer distances, which may in turn facilitate their remaining in contact over much of the width of the lipid bilayer. The close structural similarity seen between some pairs of helices in membrane and soluble proteins suggests that packing patterns observed in soluble proteins may be useful in the modeling of membrane proteins. Moreover, there do not appear to be fundamental differences between the magnitude of the forces that drive helix packing in membrane and soluble proteins, suggesting that strategies to make membrane proteins more soluble by mutating surface residues are likely to encounter success, at least in some cases.",

        "Title": "An automatic method for predicting transmembrane protein structures using cryo-EM and evolutionary data.",
        "Abstract": "The transmembrane (TM) domains of many integral membrane proteins are composed of alpha-helix bundles. Structure determination at high resolution (<4 A) of TM domains is still exceedingly difficult experimentally. Hence, some TM-protein structures have only been solved at intermediate (5-10 A) or low (>10 A) resolutions using, for example, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These structures reveal the packing arrangement of the TM domain, but cannot be used to determine the positions of individual amino acids. The observation that typically, the lipid-exposed faces of TM proteins are evolutionarily more variable and less charged than their core provides a simple rule for orienting their constituent helices. Based on this rule, we developed score functions and automated methods for orienting TM helices, for which locations and tilt angles have been determined using, e.g., cryo-EM data. The method was parameterized with the aim of retrieving the native structure of bacteriorhodopsin among near- and far-from-native templates. It was then tested on proteins that differ from bacteriorhodopsin in their sequences, architectures, and functions, such as the acetylcholine receptor and rhodopsin. The predicted structures were within 1.5-3.5 A from the native state in all cases. We conclude that the computational method can be used in conjunction with cryo-EM data to obtain approximate model structures of TM domains of proteins for which a sufficiently heterogeneous set of homologs is available. We also show that in those proteins in which relatively short loops connect neighboring helices, the scoring functions can discriminate between near- and far-from-native conformations even without the constraints imposed on helix locations and tilt angles that are derived from cryo-EM.",

        "Title": "A hierarchical approach to all-atom protein loop prediction.",
        "Abstract": "The application of all-atom force fields (and explicit or implicit solvent models) to protein homology-modeling tasks such as side-chain and loop prediction remains challenging both because of the expense of the individual energy calculations and because of the difficulty of sampling the rugged all-atom energy surface. Here we address this challenge for the problem of loop prediction through the development of numerous new algorithms, with an emphasis on multiscale and hierarchical techniques. As a first step in evaluating the performance of our loop prediction algorithm, we have applied it to the problem of reconstructing loops in native structures; we also explicitly include crystal packing to provide a fair comparison with crystal structures. In brief, large numbers of loops are generated by using a dihedral angle-based buildup procedure followed by iterative cycles of clustering, side-chain optimization, and complete energy minimization of selected loop structures. We evaluate this method by using the largest test set yet used for validation of a loop prediction method, with a total of 833 loops ranging from 4 to 12 residues in length. Average/median backbone root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) to the native structures (superimposing the body of the protein, not the loop itself) are 0.42/0.24 A for 5 residue loops, 1.00/0.44 A for 8 residue loops, and 2.47/1.83 A for 11 residue loops. Median RMSDs are substantially lower than the averages because of a small number of outliers; the causes of these failures are examined in some detail, and many can be attributed to errors in assignment of protonation states of titratable residues, omission of ligands from the simulation, and, in a few cases, probable errors in the experimentally determined structures. When these obvious problems in the data sets are filtered out, average RMSDs to the native structures improve to 0.43 A for 5 residue loops, 0.84 A for 8 residue loops, and 1.63 A for 11 residue loops. In the vast majority of cases, the method locates energy minima that are lower than or equal to that of the minimized native loop, thus indicating that sampling rarely limits prediction accuracy. The overall results are, to our knowledge, the best reported to date, and we attribute this success to the combination of an accurate all-atom energy function, efficient methods for loop buildup and side-chain optimization, and, especially for the longer loops, the hierarchical refinement protocol.",

        "Abstract": "The cadherins comprise a family of single-pass transmembrane proteins critical for cell-cell adhesion in vertebrates and invertebrates. The recently determined structure of the whole ectodomain from C-cadherin suggests that the adhesion of cadherins presented by juxtaposed cells is mediated by a strand-swapped dimer in which core hydrophobic elements are exchanged between the partner molecules. Sequence analysis suggests that several cadherin subfamilies share this adhesive mechanism. Recent work has shed new light on the molecular basis of cadherin adhesion, although understanding the specificity of these interactions remains a major challenge.",

        "Abstract": "Structural alignments often reveal relationships between proteins that cannot be detected using sequence alignment alone. However, profile search methods based entirely on structural alignments alone have not been found to be effective in finding remote homologs. Here, we explore the role of structural information in remote homolog detection and sequence alignment. To this end, we develop a series of hybrid multidimensional alignment profiles that combine sequence, secondary and tertiary structure information into hybrid profiles. Sequence-based profiles are profiles whose position-specific scoring matrix is derived from sequence alignment alone; structure-based profiles are those derived from multiple structure alignments. We compare pure sequence-based profiles to pure structure-based profiles, as well as to hybrid profiles that use combined sequence-and-structure-based profiles, where sequence-based profiles are used in loop/motif regions and structural information is used in core structural regions. All of the hybrid methods offer significant improvement over simple profile-to-profile alignment. We demonstrate that both sequence-based and structure-based profiles contribute to remote homology detection and alignment accuracy, and that each contains some unique information. We discuss the implications of these results for further improvements in amino acid sequence and structural analysis.",

        "Title": "Sequence, structure and energetic determinants of phosphopeptide selectivity of SH2 domains.",
        "Abstract": "Here, we present an approach for the prediction of binding preferences of members of a large protein family for which structural information for a number of family members bound to a substrate is available. The approach involves a number of steps. First, an accurate multiple alignment of sequences of all members of a protein family is constructed on the basis of a multiple structural superposition of family members with known structure. Second, the methods of continuum electrostatics are used to characterize the energetic contribution of each residue in a protein to the binding of its substrate. Residues that make a significant contribution are mapped onto the protein sequence and are used to define a \"binding site signature\" for the complex being considered. Third, sequences whose structures have not been determined are checked to see if they have binding-site signatures similar to one of the known complexes. Predictions of binding affinity to a given substrate are based on similarities in binding-site signature. An important component of the approach is the introduction of a context-specific substitution matrix suitable for comparison of binding-site residues. The methods are applied to the prediction of phosphopeptide selectivity of SH2 domains. To this end, the energetic roles of all protein residues in 17 different complexes of SH2 domains with their cognate targets are analyzed. The total number of residues that make significant contributions to binding is found to vary from nine to 19 in different complexes. These energetically important residues are found to contribute to binding through a variety of mechanisms, involving both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Binding-site signatures are found to involve residues in different positions in SH2 sequences, some of them as far as 9A away from a bound peptide. Surprisingly, similarities in the signatures of different domains do not correlate with whole-domain sequence identities unless the latter is greater than 50%. An extensive comparison with the optimal binding motifs determined by peptide library experiments, as well as other experimental data indicate that the similarity in binding preferences of different SH2 domains can be deduced on the basis of their binding-site signatures. The analysis provides a rationale for the empirically derived classification of SH2 domains described by Songyang & Cantley, in that proteins in the same group are found to have similar residues at positions important for binding. Confident predictions of binding preference can be made for about 85% of SH2 domain sequences found in SWISSPROT. The approach described in this work is quite general and can, in principle, be used to analyze binding preferences of members of large protein families for which structural information for a number of family members is available. It also offers a strategy for predicting cross-reactivity of compounds designed to bind to a particular target, for example in structure-based drug design.",

The electrostatic surface of S28E exhibits positive and negative patches on opposite sides, the former constituting a putative binding site for RNA.

The central feature of our structure prediction strategy involved the ability to generate good sequence-to-structure alignments and to quickly transform them into models that could be evaluated both with energy-based methods and manually. The in-house tools we used include: a) HMAP (Hybrid Multidimensional Alignment Profile)-a profile-to-profile alignment method that is derived from sequence-enhanced multiple structure alignments in core regions, and sequence motifs in non-structurally conserved regions. b) NEST-a fast model building program that applies an \"artificial evolution\" algorithm to construct a model from a given template and alignment. c) GRASP2-a new structure and alignment visualization program incorporating multiple structure superposition and domain database scanning modules. These methods were combined with model evaluation based on all atom and simplified physical-chemical energy functions. All of these methods were under development during CASP5 and consequently a great deal of manual analysis was carried out at each stage of the prediction process. This interactive model building procedure has several advantages and suggests important ways in which our and other methods can be improved, examples of which are provided.",

In this paper we review recent developments in these areas; specifically structure alignment, the detection of remote homologs and analogs, homology modeling and the use of structures to predict function. We also discuss various rationales for structural genomics initiatives. These include the structure-based clustering of sequence space and genome-wide function assignment. It is also argued that structural genomics can be integrated into more traditional biological research if specific biological questions are included in target selection strategies.",

The structure has an alpha-beta sandwich architecture consisting of two layers: a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and three side-by-side alpha-helices. The secondary structure elements have the order alphabetaalphabetabetaalphabeta along the sequence. This fold is the same as the ferredoxin-like fold, except with an additional long N-terminal helix, making it a variation on this common motif. A cluster of conserved surface residues on the beta-sheet side of the protein forms a pocket that may be important for the biological function of this conserved family of proteins.",

        "Abstract": "With the increasing number of eukaryotic genomes available, high-throughput automated tools for identification of regulatory DNA sequences are becoming increasingly feasible. Several computational approaches for the prediction of regulatory elements were recently developed. Here we combine the prediction of clusters of binding sites for transcription factors with context information taken from genome annotations. Target Explorer automates the entire process from the creation of a customized library of binding sites for known transcription factors through the prediction and annotation of putative target genes that are potentially regulated by these factors. It was specifically designed for the well-annotated Drosophila melanogaster genome, but most options can be used for sequences from other genomes as well. Target Explorer is available at http://trantor.bioc.columbia.edu/Target_Explorer/",

        "Abstract": "The role of crystal packing in determining the observed conformations of amino acid side-chains in protein crystals is investigated by (1) analysis of a database of proteins that have been crystallized in different unit cells (space group or unit cell dimensions) and (2) theoretical predictions of side-chain conformations with the crystal environment explicitly represented. Both of these approaches indicate that the crystal environment plays an important role in determining the conformations of polar side-chains on the surfaces of proteins. Inclusion of the crystal environment permits a more sensitive measurement of the achievable accuracy of side-chain prediction programs, when validating against structures obtained by X-ray crystallography. Our side-chain prediction program uses an all-atom force field and a Generalized Born model of solvation and is thus capable of modeling simple packing effects (i.e. van der Waals interactions), electrostatic effects, and desolvation, which are all important mechanisms by which the crystal environment impacts observed side-chain conformations. Our results are also relevant to the understanding of changes in side-chain conformation that may result from ligand docking and protein-protein association, insofar as the results reveal how side-chain conformations change in response to their local environment.",

        "Abstract": "Here, the methods of continuum electrostatics are used to investigate the contribution of electrostatic interactions to the binding of four protein-protein complexes; barnase-barstar, human growth hormone and its receptor, subtype N9 influenza virus neuraminidase and the NC41 antibody, the Ras binding domain (RBD) of kinase cRaf and a Ras homologue Rap1A. In two of the four complexes electrostatics are found to strongly oppose binding (hormone-receptor and neuraminidase-antibody complexes), in one case the net effect is close to zero (barnase-barstar) and in one case electrostatics provides a significant driving force favoring binding (RBD-Rap1A). In order to help understand the wide range of electrostatic contributions that were calculated, the electrostatic free energy was partitioned into contributions of individual charged and polar residues, salt bridges and networks involving salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. Although there is no one structural feature that accounts for the differences between the four interfaces, the extent to which the desolvation of buried charges is compensated by the formation of hydrogen bonds and ion pairs appears to be an important factor. Structural features that are correlated with contribution of an individual residue to stability are also discussed. These include partial burial of a charged group in the free monomer, the formation of networks involving charged and polar amino acids, and the formation of partially exposed ion-pairs. The total electrostatic contribution to binding is found to be inversely correlated with buried total and non-polar surface area. This suggests that different interfaces can be designed to exploit electrostatic and hydrophobic forces in very different ways.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a method to account for the shape of the potential energy curve in the evaluation of conformational free energies. The method is based on a procedure that generates a set of conformations, each with its own force-field energy, but adds a term to this energy that favors conformations that are close in structure (have a low rmsd) to other conformations. The sum of the force-field energy and rmsd-dependent term is defined here as the \"colony energy\" of a given conformation, because each conformation that is generated is viewed as representing a colony of points. The use of the colony energy tends to select conformations that are located in broad energy basins. The approach is applied to the ab initio prediction of the conformations of all of the loops in a dataset of 135 nonredundant proteins. By using an rmsd from a native criterion based on the superposition of loop stems, the average rmsd of 5-, 6-, 7-, and 8-residue long loops is 0.85, 0.92, 1.23, and 1.45 A, respectively. For 8-residue loops, 60 of 61 predictions have an rmsd of less than 3.0 A. The use of the colony energy is found to improve significantly the results obtained from the potential function alone.

        "Title": "Rapid grid-based construction of the molecular surface and the use of induced surface charge to calculate reaction field energies: applications to the molecular systems and geometric objects.",
        "Abstract": "This article describes a number of algorithms that are designed to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of finite difference solutions to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (the FDPB method) and to extend its range of application. The algorithms are incorporated in the DelPhi program. The first algorithm involves an efficient and accurate semianalytical method to map the molecular surface of a molecule onto a three-dimensional lattice. This method constitutes a significant improvement over existing methods in terms of its combination of speed and accuracy. The DelPhi program has also been expanded to allow the definition of geometrical objects such as spheres, cylinders, cones, and parallelepipeds, which can be used to describe a system that may also include a standard atomic level depiction of molecules. Each object can have a different dielectric constant and a different surface or volume charge distribution. The improved definition of the surface leads to increased precision in the numerical solutions of the PB equation that are obtained. A further improvement in the precision of solvation energy calculations is obtained from a procedure that calculates induced surface charges from the FDPB solutions and then uses these charges in the calculation of reaction field energies. The program allows for finite difference grids of large dimension; currently a maximum of 571(3) can be used on molecules containing several thousand atoms and charges. As described elsewhere, DelPhi can also treat mixed salt systems containing mono- and divalent ions and provide electrostatic free energies as defined by the nonlinear PB equation.",

        "Abstract": "Many proteins involved in signal transduction and vesicle trafficking contain C2 domains whose membrane association is often regulated by calcium. Here, finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann calculations are used to describe the electrostatic interactions between C2 domains of known structure and phospholipid membranes. The results explain how calcium binding can drive the association of some C2 domains to negatively charged membranes and others to neutral, zwitterionic membranes. Nonspecific electrostatic interactions are shown to be a general feature of many C2 domains of known structure, including the calcium-independent C2 domain of the PTEN tumor suppressor.",
