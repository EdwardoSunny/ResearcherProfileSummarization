        "Abstract": "In the United States (US), biosafety and biosecurity oversight of research on viruses is being reappraised. Safety in virology research is paramount and oversight frameworks should be reviewed periodically. Changes should be made with care, however, to avoid impeding science that is essential for rapidly reducing and responding to pandemic threats as well as addressing more common challenges caused by infectious diseases. Decades of research uniquely positioned the US to be able to respond to the COVID-19 crisis with astounding speed, delivering life-saving vaccines within a year of identifying the virus. We should embolden and empower this strength, which is a vital part of protecting the health, economy, and security of US citizens. Herein, we offer our perspectives on priorities for revised rules governing virology research in the US.",

        "Abstract": "Picornaviruses are nonenveloped particles with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity. This virus family includes poliovirus, hepatitis A virus, rhinoviruses, and Coxsackieviruses. Picornaviruses are common human pathogens, and infection can result in a spectrum of serious illnesses, including acute flaccid myelitis, severe respiratory complications, and hand-foot-mouth disease. Despite research on poliovirus establishing many fundamental principles of RNA virus biology and the first transgenic animal model of disease for infection by a human virus, picornaviruses are understudied. Existing knowledge gaps include, identification of molecules required for virus entry, understanding cellular and humoral immune responses elicited during virus infection, and establishment of immune-competent animal models of virus pathogenesis. Such knowledge is necessary for development of pan-picornavirus countermeasures. Defining enterovirus A71 and D68, human rhinovirus C, and echoviruses 29 as prototype pathogens of this virus family may provide insight into picornavirus biology needed to establish public health strategies necessary for pandemic preparedness.",

        "Abstract": "Enteroviruses are among the most common human viral pathogens. Infection with members of a subgroup of viruses within this genus, the nonpoliovirus enteroviruses (NPEVs), can result in a broad spectrum of serious illnesses, including acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a polio-like childhood paralysis; neonatal sepsis; aseptic meningitis; myocarditis; and hand-foot-mouth disease. Despite the diverse primary sites of virus infection, including the respiratory and alimentary tracts, and an array of diseases associated with these infections, there is significant genetic and antigenic similarity among NPEVs. This conservation results in the induction of cross-reactive antibodies that are either able to bind and neutralize or bind but not neutralize multiple NPEVs. Using plaque reduction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based binding assays, we define the antigenic relationship among poliovirus and NPEVs, including multiple isolates of EV-D68, EV-A71, EV-D70, EV-94, EV-111, Coxsackievirus A24v, and rhinovirus. The results reveal extensive cross-reactivity among EVs that cannot be predicted from phylogenetic analysis. Determining the immunologic relationship among EVs is critical to understanding the humoral response elicited during homologous and heterologous virus infections. ",

        "Abstract": "The contributions of RIG-I and MDA5 receptors to sensing viruses of the Picornaviridae family were investigated. The picornaviruses encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) are detected by both MDA5 and RIG-I in bone marrow derived macrophages. In macrophages from wild type mice, type I IFN is produced early after infection; IFN\u03b2 synthesis is reduced in the absence of each sensor, while IFN\u03b1 production is reduced in the absence of MDA5. EMCV and CVB3 do not replicate in murine macrophages, and their detection is different in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), in which the viruses replicate to high titers. In MEFs RIG-I was essential for the expression of type I IFNs but contributes to increased yields of CVB3, while MDA5 inhibited CVB3 replication but in an IFN independent manner. These observations demonstrate functional redundancy within the innate immune response to picornaviruses.",

        "Abstract": "Fetal infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) can lead to congenital Zika virus syndrome (cZVS), which includes cortical malformations and microcephaly. The aspects of cortical development that are affected during virus infection are unknown. Using organotypic brain slice cultures generated from embryonic mice of various ages, sites of ZIKV replication including the neocortical proliferative zone and radial columns, as well as the developing midbrain, were identified. The infected radial units are surrounded by uninfected cells undergoing apoptosis, suggesting that programmed cell death may limit viral dissemination in the brain and may constrain virus-associated injury. Therefore, a critical aspect of ZIKV-induced neuropathology may be defined by death of uninfected cells. All ZIKV isolates assayed replicated efficiently in early and midgestation cultures, and two isolates examined replicated in late-gestation tissue. Alteration of neocortical cytoarchitecture, such as disruption of the highly elongated basal processes of the radial glial progenitor cells and impairment of postmitotic neuronal migration, were also observed. These data suggest that all lineages of ZIKV tested are neurotropic, and that ZIKV infection interferes with multiple aspects of neurodevelopment that contribute to the complexity of cZVS.",

        "Abstract": "Major- and minor-group human rhinoviruses (HRV) enter their host by binding to the cell surface molecules ICAM-1 and LDL-R, respectively, which are present on both macrophages and epithelial cells. Although epithelial cells are the primary site of productive HRV infection, previous studies have implicated macrophages in establishing the cytokine dysregulation that occurs during rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations. Analysis of the transcriptome of primary human macrophages exposed to major- and minor-group HRV demonstrated differential gene expression. Alterations in gene expression were traced to differential mitochondrial activity and signaling pathway activation between two rhinovirus serotypes, HRV16 (major-group) and HRV1A (minor-group), upon initial HRV binding. Variances in phosphorylation of kinases (p38, JNK, ERK5) and transcription factors (ATF-2, CREB, CEBP-alpha) were observed between the major- and minor-group HRV treatments. Differential activation of signaling pathways led to changes in the production of the asthma-relevant cytokines CCL20, CCL2, and IL-10. This is the first report of genetically similar viruses eliciting dissimilar cytokine release, transcription factor phosphorylation, and MAPK activation from macrophages, suggesting that receptor use is a mechanism for establishing the inflammatory microenvironment in the human airway upon exposure to rhinovirus.",

        "Abstract": "The type I interferon (IFN) response protects cells from viral infection by inducing hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), some of which encode direct antiviral effectors. Recent screening studies have begun to catalogue ISGs with antiviral activity against several RNA and DNA viruses. However, antiviral ISG specificity across multiple distinct classes of viruses remains largely unexplored. Here we used an ectopic expression assay to screen a library of more than 350 human ISGs for effects on 14 viruses representing 7 families and 11 genera. We show that 47 genes inhibit one or more viruses, and 25 genes enhance virus infectivity. Comparative analysis reveals that the screened ISGs target positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses more effectively than negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Gene clustering highlights the cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS, also known as MB21D1) as a gene whose expression also broadly inhibits several RNA viruses. In vitro, lentiviral delivery of enzymatically active cGAS triggers a STING-dependent, IRF3-mediated antiviral program that functions independently of canonical IFN/STAT1 signalling. In vivo, genetic ablation of murine cGAS reveals its requirement in the antiviral response to two DNA viruses, and an unappreciated contribution to the innate control of an RNA virus. These studies uncover new paradigms for the preferential specificity of IFN-mediated antiviral pathways spanning several virus families.",

        "Abstract": "Rhinoviruses (RVs) are picornaviruses that are causative agents of the majority of upper respiratory tract infections, or \"common colds,\" in humans. RVs infect both the upper and lower respiratory tract, and in addition to the common cold may also cause pneumonia, complications in patients with chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, and asthma exacerbations. Convenient animal models are not available to study the pathogenesis of rhinovirus-induced illness. Rhinovirus RV1A replicates poorly in mouse cells; variants with improved replication were selected by serial passage through mouse embryonic fibroblasts and mouse lung epithelial cells. Adaptation for improved growth in mouse cells was mediated by amino acid changes in the RV1a non-structural protein 3A. Mouse cell-adapted RV1A was capable of productively infecting mice in which the airway was subjected to chemical permeabilization. A mouse model for RV infection will permit studies of RV pathogenesis and may identify targets for therapeutic intervention.",

        "Title": "Components of the multifactor complex needed for internal initiation by the IRES of hepatitis C virus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",
        "Abstract": "Interaction between the 40S ribosomal subunit and the IRES of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is thought to be independent of initiation proteins, while joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit, and initiation of translation is dependent upon components of the translation machinery. An established in vivo functional assay for internal initiation mediated by the HCV IRES was used to identify proteins needed for IRES dependent translation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains possessing alterations of the translation machinery. Internal initiation dependent upon the HCV IRES was abrogated in strains lacking eIF5B, and reduced in strains with altered eIF3, either lacking the Hcr1p subunit, a component of eIF3 not previously known to interact with HCV RNA, or possessing an amino acid change in the Rpg1p subunit. The HCV RNA-induced conformational change in the 40S subunit might affect positioning of eIF3 and lead to different interactions between the ribosome, eIF3, and the multifactor complex. HCV IRES dependent initiation was unaffected in strains in which the concentration of the initiating tRNA was reduced. Alteration of the \u03b4 subunit of eIF2B, which leads to inefficient recycling, or substitution of aspartic acid for serine 51 of eIF2\u03b1 had no effect on internal initiation. Production of human Pkr inhibited HCV IRES dependent initiation in yeast. The synthesis of Pkr in yeast is known to result in high levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, increased Gcn4p synthesis, and reduced ribosomal protein production. These alterations may explain the effect of Pkr synthesis on HCV IRES dependent initiation in yeast.",

        "Abstract": "The absence of a full-length PB1-F2 protein has been suggested as one possible determinant for the low pathogenicity of the 2009 Influenza A H1N1 pandemic strain. Since the PB1-F2 sequence of this strain has three stop codons and its ancestors encode a full-length protein, the stop codons must have appeared recently. This suggests that the PB1-F2 protein is not evolutionary and functionally important for the new virus. We investigate the role of this protein in the evolution of influenza A viruses, and in particular in relation to the history of the new strain. We show that its evolutionary history is comparable to other, non-translated, subsequences in the PB1 segment, suggesting that PB1-F2 does not contribute significantly to the fitness of the influenza A virus.",

        "Title": "Cleavage of IPS-1 in cells infected with human rhinovirus.",
        "Abstract": "Rhinoviruses are prevalent human pathogens that are associated with life-threatening acute asthma exacerbations. The innate immune response to rhinovirus infection, which may play an important role in virus-induced asthma induction, has not been comprehensively investigated. We examined the innate immune response in cells infected with human rhinovirus 1a (HRV1a). Beta interferon (IFN-beta) mRNA was induced in HRV1a-infected cells at levels significantly lower than in cells infected with Sendai virus. To understand the basis for this observation, we determined whether components of the pathway leading to IFN-beta induction were altered during infection. Dimerization of the transcription factor IRF-3, which is required for synthesis of IFN-beta mRNA, is not observed in cells infected with HRV1a. Beginning at 7 h postinfection, IPS-1, a protein that is essential for cytosolic sensing of viral RNA, is degraded in HRV1a-infected cells. Induction of apoptosis by puromycin led to the cleavage of IPS-1, but treatment of HRV1a-infected cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD, did not block cleavage of IPS-1. IPS-1 is cleaved in vitro by caspase-3 and by the picornaviral proteinases 2A(pro) and 3C(pro). Expression of HRV1a and polioviral 2A(pro) and 3C(pro) led to degradation of IPS-1 in cells. These results suggest that IPS-1 is cleaved during HRV1a infection by three different proteases. Cleavage of IPS-1 may be a mechanism for evasion of the type I IFN response, leading to a more robust infection.",

        "Title": "RIG-I is cleaved during picornavirus infection.",
        "Abstract": "The innate immune system senses RNA virus infections through membrane-bound Toll-like receptors or the cytoplasmic proteins RIG-I and MDA-5. RIG-I is believed to recognize the 5'-triphosphate present on many viral RNAs, and hence is important for sensing infections by paramyxoviruses, influenza viruses, rhabdoviruses, and flaviviruses. MDA-5 recognizes dsRNA, and senses infection with picornaviruses, whose RNA 5'-ends are linked to a viral protein, VPg, not a 5'-triphosphate. We previously showed that MDA-5 is degraded in cells infected with different picornaviruses, and suggested that such cleavage might be a mechanism to antagonize production of type I IFN in response to viral infection. Here we examined the state of RIG-I during picornavirus infection. RIG-I is degraded in cells infected with poliovirus, rhinoviruses, echovirus, and encephalomyocarditis virus. In contrast to MDA-5, cleavage of RIG-I is not accomplished by cellular caspases or the proteasome. Rather, the viral proteinase 3C(pro) cleaves RIG-I, both in vitro and in cells. Cleavage of RIG-I during picornavirus infection may constitute another mechanism for attenuating the innate response to viral infection.",

        "Abstract": "The innate immune system responds within minutes of infection to produce type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Interferons induce the synthesis of cell proteins with antiviral activity, and also shape the adaptive immune response by priming T cells. Despite the discovery of interferons over 50 years ago, only recently have we begun to understand how cells sense the presence of a virus infection. Two families of pattern recognition receptors have been shown to distinguish unique molecules present in pathogens, such as bacterial and fungal cell wall components, viral RNA and DNA, and lipoproteins. The first family includes the membrane-bound toll-like receptors (TLRs). Studies of the signaling pathways that lead from pattern recognition to cytokine induction have revealed extensive and overlapping cascades that involve protein-protein interactions and phosphorylation, and culminate in activation of transcription proteins that control the transcription of genes encoding interferons and other cytokines. A second family of pattern recognition receptors has recently been identified, which comprises the cytoplasmic sensors of viral nucleic acids, including MDA-5, RIG-I, and LGP2. In this review we summarize the discovery of these cytoplasmic sensors, how they recognize nucleic acids, the signaling pathways leading to cytokine synthesis, and viral countermeasures that have evolved to antagonize the functions of these proteins. We also consider the function of these cytoplasmic sensors in apoptosis, development and differentiation, and diabetes.",

        "Title": "Proteinase 2Apro is essential for enterovirus replication in type I interferon-treated cells.",
        "Abstract": "The Picornaviridae family comprises a diverse group of small RNA viruses that cause a variety of human and animal diseases. Some of these viruses are known to induce cleavage of components of the innate immune system and to inhibit steps in the interferon pathway that lead to the production of type I interferon. There has been no study of the effect of picornaviral infection on the events that occur after interferons have been produced. To determine whether members of the Enterovirus genus can antagonize the antiviral activity of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), we pretreated cells with alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) and then infected the cells with poliovirus type 1, 2, or 3; enterovirus type 70; or human rhinovirus type 16. We found that these viruses were able to replicate in IFN-alpha-pretreated cells but that replication of vesicular stomatitis virus, a Rhabdovirus, and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a picornavirus of the Cardiovirus genus, was completely inhibited. Although EMCV is sensitive to IFN-alpha, coinfection of cells with poliovirus and EMCV leads to EMCV replication in IFN-alpha-pretreated cells. The enteroviral 2A proteinase (2A(pro)) is essential for replication in cells pretreated with interferon, because amino acid changes in this protein render poliovirus sensitive to IFN-alpha. The addition of the poliovirus 2A(pro) gene to the EMCV genome allowed EMCV to replicate in IFN-alpha-pretreated cells. These results support an inhibitory role for 2A(pro) in the most downstream event in interferon signaling, the antiviral activities of ISGs.",

        "Abstract": "Enterovirus type 70, an etiologic agent of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, may bind different cellular receptors depending on cell type. To understand how EV70-receptor interaction is controlled, we studied two variants of the virus with distinct receptor utilization. EV70-Rmk, derived by passage in rhesus monkey kidney cells, replicates poorly in HeLa cells and does not cause cytopathic effects. Decay accelerating factor (DAF) is not a cell receptor for EV70-Rmk. Passage of EV70-Rmk in HeLa cells lead to isolation of EV70-Dne, which does not replicate in rhesus monkey kidney cells but grows to high titers in HeLa cells and causes cytopathic effects. DAF is sufficient for cell entry of EV70-Dne. EV70-Rmk replicates in human eye and brain-derived cell lines, whereas the Dne strain replicates only in HeLa cells and in conjunctiva-derived 15C4 cells. The two EV70 strains differ by five amino acid changes in the viral capsid. Single substitution of four of the five EV70-Rmk amino acids with the residue from EV70-Dne leads to lytic replication in HeLa cells. Conversely, substitution of any of the five EV70-Dne amino acids with the EV70-Rmk amino acid does not alter replication in HeLa cells. Three of these capsid amino acids are predicted to be located in the canyon encircling the fivefold axis of symmetry, one amino acid is found at the fivefold axis of symmetry, and one is located the interior of the capsid. The five EV70 residues define a region of the capsid that controls viral host range, DAF utilization, and cytopathogenicity.",

        "Abstract": "Infections with RNA viruses are sensed by the innate immune system through membrane-bound Toll-like receptors or the cytoplasmic RNA helicases RIG-I and MDA-5. It is believed that MDA-5 is crucial for sensing infections by picornaviruses, but there have been no studies on the role of this protein during infection with poliovirus, the prototypic picornavirus. Beginning at 4 h postinfection, MDA-5 protein is degraded in poliovirus-infected cells. Levels of MDA-5 declined beginning at 6 h after infection with rhinovirus type 1a or encephalomyocarditis virus, but the protein was stable in cells infected with rhinovirus type 16 or echovirus type 1. Cleavage of MDA-5 is not carried out by either poliovirus proteinase 2Apro or 3Cpro. Instead, degradation of MDA-5 in poliovirus-infected cells occurs in a proteasome- and caspase-dependent manner. Degradation of MDA-5 during poliovirus infection correlates with cleavage of poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP), a hallmark of apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis by puromycin leads to cleavage of both PARP and MDA-5. The MDA-5 cleavage product observed in cells treated with puromycin is approximately 90 kDa, similar in size to the putative cleavage product observed in poliovirus-infected cells. Poliovirus-induced cleavage of MDA-5 may be a mechanism to antagonize production of type I interferon in response to viral infection.",

        "Abstract": "Mouse cells are not permissive for the replication of human rhinovirus type 2 (HRV2). To determine the role of the HRV2 internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in determining species specificity, a recombinant poliovirus (P1/HRV2) was constructed by substituting the poliovirus IRES with the IRES from HRV2. This recombinant virus replicated in all human and murine cell lines examined, demonstrating that the HRV2 IRES does not limit viral replication in transformed murine cells. P1/HRV2 replicated in the brain and spinal cord in neonatal but not adult mice transgenic for the poliovirus receptor, CD155. Passage of P1/HRV2 in mice led to selection of a virus that caused paralysis in neonatal mice. To determine the relationship between HRV2 IRES-mediated translation and replication of P1/HRV2 in mice, recombinant human adenoviruses were used to express bicistronic mRNAs in murine organs. The results demonstrate that the HRV2 IRES mediates translation in organs of neonatal but not adult mice. These findings show that HRV2 IRES-mediated translation is a determinant of virus replication in the murine brain and spinal cord and suggest that the IRES determines the species specificity of HRV2 infection.",

        "Abstract": "Poliovirus was first isolated nearly 100 years ago in a landmark experiment that established the viral etiology of poliomyelitis. This discovery stimulated investigation of the pathogenesis of poliomyelitis in many laboratories. Nearly 50 years later, when two effective poliovirus vaccines were developed, the impetus to study poliovirus pathogenesis waned. The identification of the cell receptor for poliovirus, CD155, and its use in the development of transgenic mice susceptible to poliovirus revived interest in understanding how the virus causes disease. Experiments in CD155 transgenic mice have provided new information on the initial sites of virus replication in the host, how the virus spreads to the central nervous system through the blood and by axonal transport, the determinants of viral tropism, and the basis for the attenuation phenotype of the Sabin vaccine strains. Despite these advances, our understanding of poliovirus pathogenesis is still incomplete. The dilemma is not how to answer the remaining questions, but whether there will be sufficient time to do so before global eradication of poliomyelitis leads to cessation of research on the disease.",

        "Title": "Hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site-dependent translation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is independent of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein, poly(rC)-binding protein 2, and La protein.",
        "Abstract": "Translation initiation of some viral and cellular mRNAs occurs by ribosome binding to an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Internal initiation mediated by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was shown by translation of the second open reading frame in a bicistronic mRNA. Introduction of a single base change in the HCV IRES, known to abrogate internal initiation in mammalian cells, abolished translation of the second open reading frame. Internal initiation mediated by the HCV IRES was independent of the nonsense-mediated decay pathway and the cap binding protein eIF4E, indicating that translation is not a result of mRNA degradation or 5'-end-dependent initiation. Human La protein binds the HCV IRES and is required for efficient internal initiation. Disruption of the S. cerevisiae genes that encode La protein orthologs and synthesis of wild-type human La protein in yeast had no effect on HCV IRES-dependent translation. Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (Ptb) and poly-(rC)-binding protein 2 (Pcbp2), which may be required for HCV IRES-dependent initiation in mammalian cells, are not encoded within the S. cerevisiae genome. HCV IRES-dependent translation in S. cerevisiae was independent of human Pcbp2 protein and stimulated by the presence of human Ptb protein. These findings demonstrate that the genome of S. cerevisiae encodes all proteins necessary for internal initiation of translation mediated by the HCV IRES.",

        "Title": "Amino acid changes in proteins 2B and 3A mediate rhinovirus type 39 growth in mouse cells.",
        "Abstract": "Many steps of viral replication are dependent on the interaction of viral proteins with host cell components. To identify rhinovirus proteins involved in such interactions, human rhinovirus 39 (HRV39), a virus unable to replicate in mouse cells, was adapted to efficient growth in mouse cells producing the viral receptor ICAM-1 (ICAM-L cells). Amino acid changes were identified in the 2B and 3A proteins of the adapted virus, RV39/L. Changes in 2B were sufficient to permit viral growth in mouse cells; however, changes in both 2B and 3A were required for maximal viral RNA synthesis in mouse cells. Examination of infected HeLa cells by electron microscopy demonstrated that human rhinoviruses induced the formation of cytoplasmic membranous vesicles, similar to those observed in cells infected with other picornaviruses. Vesicles were also observed in the cytoplasm of HRV39-infected mouse cells despite the absence of viral RNA replication. Synthesis of picornaviral nonstructural proteins 2C, 2BC, and 3A is known to be required for formation of membranous vesicles. We suggest that productive HRV39 infection is blocked in ICAM-L cells at a step posttranslation and prior to the formation of a functional replication complex. The observation that changes in HRV39 2B and 3A proteins lead to viral growth in mouse cells suggests that one or both of these proteins interact with host cell proteins to promote viral replication.",

        "Abstract": "Poliovirus replication is limited to a few organs, including the brain and spinal cord. This restricted tropism may be a consequence of organ-specific differences in translation initiation by the poliovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES). A C-to-U mutation at base 472 in the IRES of the Sabin type 3 poliovirus vaccine strain, known to attenuate neurovirulence, may further restrict tropism by eliminating viral replication in the CNS. To determine the relationship between IRES-mediated translation and poliovirus tropism, recombinant human adenoviruses were used to express bicistronic mRNAs in murine organs. The IRESs of poliovirus, the cardiotropic coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), and the hepatotropic hepatitis C virus (HCV) mediate translation in many organs, including those that do not support viral replication. A translation defect associated with the Sabin type 3 IRES was observed in all organs examined. Poliovirus type 1 and recombinant polioviruses dependent on the IRES of CVB3 or HCV replicate in the CNS of mice and cause paralysis. Although the type 3 Sabin strain is an effective vaccine, polioviruses with a U at base 472 of the IRES cause paralysis in newborn mice. Tropism of wild-type and vaccine strains of poliovirus is therefore determined after internal ribosome entry.",

        "Abstract": "We previously reported the isolation of a mutant poliovirus lacking the entire genomic RNA 3' noncoding region. Infection of HeLa cell monolayers with this deletion mutant revealed only a minor defect in the levels of viral RNA replication. To further analyze the consequences of the genomic 3' noncoding region deletion, we examined viral RNA replication in a neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH cells. The minor genomic RNA replication defect in HeLa cells was significantly exacerbated in the SK-N-SH cells, resulting in a decreased capacity for mutant virus growth. Analysis of the nature of the RNA replication deficiency revealed that deleting the poliovirus genomic 3' noncoding region resulted in a positive-strand RNA synthesis defect. The RNA replication deficiency in SK-N-SH cells was not due to a major defect in viral translation or viral protein processing. Neurovirulence of the mutant virus was determined in a transgenic mouse line expressing the human poliovirus receptor. Greater than 1,000 times more mutant virus was required to paralyze 50% of inoculated mice, compared to that with wild-type virus. These data suggest that, together with a cellular factor(s) that is limiting in neuronal cells, the poliovirus 3' noncoding region is involved in positive-strand synthesis during genome replication.",

Production of human integrin very late antigen 2, a receptor for echovirus type 1, in transgenic mice conferred susceptibility to viral infection. Intracerebral inoculation of newborn transgenic mice with echovirus leads to paralysis and wasting. No disease was observed in infected nontransgenic mice. In paralyzed mice significant damage was observed in the outer layers of the cerebrum, and numerous condensed neuronal nuclei were present. In contrast, intracerebral inoculation of adolescent (3- to 4-week-old) transgenic mice with echovirus type 1 did not lead to paralysis but an acute wasting phenotype and myocarditis. These findings establish human very late antigen 2 transgenic mice as a model for echovirus pathogenesis.",

We first demonstrate the existence of soluble CD155 (sCD155) isoforms in culture medium conditioned by CD155-expressing cells, in human serum and in cerebrospinal fluid. sCD155 concentration was measured in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid using a specific ELISA. Analysis of conditioned media indicated that sCD155 release does not require protease activity. In order to determine which tissues are responsible for sCD155 expression, we have quantified CD155 mRNAs in human normal tissues. The highest expression was observed in liver. The CD155alpha transcript is the most abundant and the proportion of the CD155beta and CD155gamma variants was similar between the tissues. Finally, serum purified sCD155 reduces poliovirus entry mediated by membrane-bound CD155. The high level of CD155 synthesis in many tissues and the presence of sCD155 in biological fluids suggest the existence of an important role for the protein in cellular function.",

However, infection of these cells at a low multiplicity of infection leads to no discernible cytopathic effect, and low virus titers are produced. A variant virus, 16/L, was isolated after alternate passage of rhinovirus 16 between HeLa and ICAM-1 L cells. Infection of mouse cells with 16/L leads to higher virus titers, increased production of RNA, and total cytopathic effect. Three amino acid changes were identified in the P2 region of virus 16/L, and the adaptation phenotype mapped to two changes in protein 2C.
