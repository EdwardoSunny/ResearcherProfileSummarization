        "Title": "Aberrant mitochondrial dynamics contributes to diaphragmatic weakness induced by mechanical ventilation.",
        "Abstract": "In critical care patients, the \"\"temporary inactivity of the diaphragm caused by mechanical ventilation (MV) triggers a series of events leading to diaphragmatic dysfunction and atrophy, commonly known as ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD). While mitochondrial dysfunction related to oxidative stress is recognized as a crucial factor in VIDD, the exact molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. In this study, we observe that 6\u2005h of MV triggers aberrant mitochondrial dynamics, resulting in a reduction in mitochondrial size and interaction, associated with increased expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). This effect can be prevented by P110, a molecule that inhibits the recruitment of DRP1 to the mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, isolated mitochondria from the diaphragms of ventilated patients exhibited increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These mitochondrial changes were associated with the rapid oxidation of type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) and a decrease in the stabilizing subunit calstabin 1. Subsequently, we observed that the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the ventilated diaphragms showed increased calcium leakage and reduced contractile function. Importantly, the mitochondrial fission inhibitor P110 effectively prevented all of these alterations. Taken together, the results of our study illustrate that MV leads, in the diaphragm, to both mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction, linked to the up-/down-regulation of 320 proteins, as assessed through global comprehensive quantitative proteomics analysis, primarily associated with mitochondrial function. These outcomes underscore the significance of developing compounds aimed at modulating the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion as potential interventions to mitigate VIDD in human patients.",

We demonstrate the role of ZA-treatment on bone and muscle using a mouse model of accelerated bone remodeling, which represents the clinical manifestation of non-tumor associated metabolic bone disease. ZA increased bone mass and strength and rescued osteocyte lacunocanalicular organization. Short-term ZA treatment increased muscle mass, whereas prolonged, preventive treatment improved muscle mass and function. In these mice, muscle fiber-type shifted from oxidative to glycolytic and ZA restored normal muscle fiber distribution. By blocking TGF\u03b2 release from bone, ZA improved muscle function, promoted myoblast differentiation and stabilized Ryanodine Receptor-1 calcium channel. These data demonstrate the beneficial effects of ZA in maintaining bone health and preserving muscle mass and function in a model of metabolic bone disease.",

        "Abstract": "This Review provides an update on ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and their role in human diseases of heart, muscle, and brain. Calcium (Ca2+) is a requisite second messenger in all living organisms. From C. elegans to mammals, Ca2+ is necessary for locomotion, bodily functions, and neural activity. However, too much of a good thing can be bad. Intracellular Ca2+ overload can result in loss of function and death. Intracellular Ca2+ release channels evolved to safely provide large, rapid Ca2+ signals without exposure to toxic extracellular Ca2+. RyRs are intracellular Ca2+ release channels present throughout the zoosphere. Over the past 35 years, our knowledge of RyRs has advanced to the level of atomic-resolution structures revealing their role in the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of human disorders of heart, muscle, and brain. Stress-induced RyR-mediated intracellular Ca2+ leak in the heart can promote heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. In skeletal muscle, RyR1 leak contributes to muscle weakness in inherited myopathies, to age-related loss of muscle function and cancer-associated muscle weakness, and to impaired muscle function in muscular dystrophies, including Duchenne. In the brain, leaky RyR channels contribute to cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease, posttraumatic stress disorder, and Huntington's disease. Novel therapeutics targeting dysfunctional RyRs are showing promise.",

        "Title": "IP3 receptor orchestrates maladaptive vascular responses in heart failure.",
        "Abstract": "Patients with heart failure (HF) have augmented vascular tone, which increases cardiac workload, impairing ventricular output and promoting further myocardial dysfunction. The molecular mechanisms underlying the maladaptive vascular responses observed in HF are not fully understood. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) control vasoconstriction via a Ca2+-dependent process, in which the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R1) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays a major role. To dissect the mechanistic contribution of intracellular Ca2+ release to the increased vascular tone observed in HF, we analyzed the remodeling of IP3R1 in aortic tissues from patients with HF and from controls. VSMC IP3R1 channels from patients with HF and HF mice were hyperphosphorylated by both serine and tyrosine kinases. VSMCs isolated from IP3R1VSMC-/- mice exhibited blunted Ca2+ responses to angiotensin II (ATII) and norepinephrine compared with control VSMCs. IP3R1VSMC-/- mice displayed significantly reduced responses to ATII, both in vivo and ex vivo. HF IP3R1VSMC-/- mice developed significantly less afterload compared with HF IP3R1fl/fl mice and exhibited significantly attenuated progression toward decompensated HF and reduced interstitial fibrosis. Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of the MLC by MLCK activated VSMC contraction. MLC phosphorylation was markedly increased in VSMCs from patients with HF and HF mice but reduced in VSMCs from HF IP3R1VSMC-/- mice and HF WT mice treated with ML-7. Taken together, our data indicate that VSMC IP3R1 is a major effector of increased vascular tone, which contributes to increased cardiac afterload and decompensation in HF.",

        "Abstract": "Mechanistically driven therapies for atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, are urgently needed, the development of which requires improved understanding of the cellular signaling pathways that facilitate the structural and electrophysiological remodeling that occurs in the atria. Similar to humans, increased persistent Na+ current leads to the development of an atrial myopathy and spontaneous and long-lasting episodes of AF in mice. How increased persistent Na+ current causes both structural and electrophysiological remodeling in the atria is unknown. We crossbred mice expressing human F1759A-NaV1.5 channels with mice expressing human mitochondrial catalase (mCAT). Increased expression of mCAT attenuated mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the structural remodeling that was induced by persistent F1759A-Na+ current. Despite the heterogeneously prolonged atrial action potential, which was unaffected by the reduction in ROS, the incidences of spontaneous AF, pacing-induced after-depolarizations, and AF were substantially reduced. Expression of mCAT markedly reduced persistent Na+ current-induced ryanodine receptor oxidation and dysfunction. In summary, increased persistent Na+ current in atrial cardiomyocytes, which is observed in patients with AF, induced atrial enlargement, fibrosis, mitochondrial dysmorphology, early after-depolarizations, and AF, all of which can be attenuated by resolving mitochondrial oxidative stress.",

Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of the RyR have primarily used detergent to solubilize the channel; in the present study, we have used cryo-EM to solve high-resolution structures of the channel in liposomes using a gel-filtration approach with on-column detergent removal to form liposomes and incorporate the channel simultaneously. This allowed us to resolve the structure of the channel in the primed and open states at 3.4 and 4.0\u00a0\u00c5, respectively, with a single dataset. This method offers validation for detergent-based structures of the RyR and offers a starting point for utilizing a chemical gradient mimicking the SR, where Ca",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA), which encodes A-type lamins, cause several diseases called laminopathies, the most common of which is dilated cardiomyopathy with muscular dystrophy. The role of Ca2+ regulation in these diseases remain poorly understood. We now show biochemical remodeling of the ryanodine receptor (RyR)/intracellular Ca2+ release channel in heart samples from human subjects with LMNA mutations, including protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation, oxidation and depletion of the stabilizing subunit calstabin. In the LmnaH222P/H222P murine model of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy caused by LMNA mutation, we demonstrate an age-dependent biochemical remodeling of RyR2 in the heart and RyR1 in skeletal muscle. This RyR remodeling is associated with heart and skeletal muscle dysfunction. Defective heart and muscle function are ameliorated by treatment with a novel Rycal small molecule drug (S107) that fixes 'leaky' RyRs. SMAD3 phosphorylation is increased in hearts and diaphragms of LmnaH222P/H222P mice, which enhances NADPH oxidase binding to RyR channels, contributing to their oxidation. There is also increased generalized protein oxidation, increased calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-catalyzed phosphorylation of RyRs and increased protein kinase A activity in these tissues. Our data show that RyR remodeling plays a role in cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle dysfunction caused by LMNA mutation and identify these Ca2+ channels as a potential therapeutic target.",

        "Title": "Role of defective calcium regulation in cardiorespiratory dysfunction in Huntington's disease.",
        "Abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive, autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder affecting striatal neurons beginning in young adults with loss of muscle coordination and cognitive decline. Less appreciated is the fact that patients with HD also exhibit cardiac and respiratory dysfunction, including pulmonary insufficiency and cardiac arrhythmias. The underlying mechanism for these symptoms is poorly understood. In the present study we provide insight into the cause of cardiorespiratory dysfunction in HD and identify a potentially novel therapeutic target. We now show that intracellular calcium (Ca2+) leak via posttranslationally modified ryanodine receptor/intracellular calcium release (RyR) channels plays an important role in HD pathology. RyR channels were oxidized, PKA phosphorylated, and leaky in brain, heart, and diaphragm both in patients with HD and in a murine model of HD (Q175). HD mice (Q175) with endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak exhibited cognitive dysfunction, decreased parasympathetic tone associated with cardiac arrhythmias, and reduced diaphragmatic contractile function resulting in impaired respiratory function. Defects in cognitive, motor, and respiratory functions were ameliorated by treatment with a novel Rycal small-molecule drug (S107) that fixes leaky RyR. Thus, leaky RyRs likely play a role in neuronal, cardiac, and diaphragmatic pathophysiology in HD, and RyRs are a potential novel therapeutic target.",

        "Title": "Intracellular calcium leak as a therapeutic target for RYR1-related myopathies.",
        "Abstract": "RYR1 encodes the type 1 ryanodine receptor, an intracellular calcium release channel (RyR1) on the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Pathogenic RYR1 variations can destabilize RyR1 leading to calcium leak causing oxidative overload and myopathy. However, the effect of RyR1 leak has not been established in individuals with RYR1-related myopathies (RYR1-RM), a broad spectrum of rare neuromuscular disorders. We sought to determine whether RYR1-RM affected individuals exhibit pathologic, leaky RyR1 and whether variant location in the channel structure can predict pathogenicity. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from 17 individuals with RYR1-RM. Mutant RyR1 from these individuals exhibited pathologic SR calcium leak and increased activity of calcium-activated proteases. The increased calcium leak and protease activity were normalized by ex-vivo treatment with S107, a RyR stabilizing Rycal molecule. Using the cryo-EM structure of RyR1 and a new dataset of\u2009>\u20092200 suspected RYR1-RM affected individuals we developed a method for assigning pathogenicity probabilities to RYR1 variants based on 3D co-localization of known pathogenic variants. This study provides the rationale for a clinical trial testing Rycals in RYR1-RM affected individuals and introduces a predictive tool for investigating the pathogenicity of RYR1 variants of uncertain significance.",

        "Abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality. Recently, we created a mouse model with spontaneous and sustained AF caused by a mutation in the NaV1.5 channel (F1759A) that enhances persistent Na+ current, thereby enabling the investigation of molecular mechanisms that cause AF and the identification of novel treatment strategies. The mice have regional heterogeneity of action potential duration of the atria similar to observations in patients with AF. In these mice, we found that the initiation and persistence of the rotational reentrant AF arrhythmias, known as spiral waves or rotors, were dependent upon action potential duration heterogeneity. The centers of the rotors were localized to regions of greatest heterogeneity of the action potential duration. Pharmacologically attenuating the action potential duration heterogeneity reduced both spontaneous and pacing-induced AF. Computer-based simulations also demonstrated that the action potential duration heterogeneity is sufficient to generate rotors that manifest as AF. Taken together, these findings suggest that action potential duration heterogeneity in mice and humans is one mechanism by which AF is initiated and that reducing action potential duration heterogeneity can lessen the burden of AF.",

        "Abstract": "Arginine methylation is a ubiquitous posttranslational modification that regulates critical cellular processes including signal transduction and pre-mRNA splicing. Here, we report that the tumor-suppressor PTEN is methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6). Mass-spectrometry analysis reveals that PTEN is dimethylated at arginine 159 (R159). We found that PTEN is mutated at R159 in cancers, and the PTEN mutant R159K loses its capability to inhibit the PI3K-AKT cascade. Furthermore, PRMT6 is physically associated with PTEN, promotes asymmetrical dimethylation of PTEN, and regulates the PI3K-AKT cascade through PTEN R159 methylation. In addition, using transcriptome analyses, we found that PTEN R159 methylation is involved in modulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. Our results demonstrate that PTEN is functionally regulated by arginine methylation. We propose that PTEN arginine methylation modulates pre-mRNA alternative splicing and influences diverse physiologic processes.",

        "Abstract": "Single-channel recordings are widely used to explore functional properties of ion channels. Typically, such recordings are performed at bandwidths of less than 10 kHz because of signal-to-noise considerations, limiting the temporal resolution available for studying fast gating dynamics to greater than 100 \u00b5s. Here we present experimental methods that directly integrate suspended lipid bilayers with high-bandwidth, low-noise transimpedance amplifiers based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits (IC) technology to achieve bandwidths in excess of 500 kHz and microsecond temporal resolution. We use this CMOS-integrated bilayer system to study the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1), a Ca",

        "Abstract": "Muscle weakness and cachexia are significant paraneoplastic syndromes of many advanced cancers. Osteolytic bone metastases are common in advanced breast cancer and are a major contributor to decreased survival, performance, and quality of life for patients. Pathologic fracture caused by osteolytic cancer in bone (OCIB) leads to a significant (32%) increased risk of death compared to patients without fracture. Since muscle weakness is linked to risk of falls which are a major cause of fracture, we have investigated skeletal muscle response to OCIB. Here, we show that a syngeneic mouse model of OCIB (4T1 mammary tumor cells) leads to cachexia and skeletal muscle weakness associated with oxidation of the ryanodine receptor and calcium (Ca",

        "Abstract": "Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) cause muscle weakness, bone loss, and joint pain in up to half of cancer patients. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that increased osteoclastic bone resorption can impair muscle contractility and prime the bone microenvironment to accelerate metastatic growth. We hypothesized that AI-induced bone loss could increase breast cancer progression in bone and exacerbate muscle weakness associated with bone metastases. Female athymic nude mice underwent ovariectomy (OVX) or sham surgery and were treated with vehicle or AI (letrozole; Let). An OVX-Let group was then further treated with bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid; Zol). At week three, trabecular bone volume was measured and mice were inoculated with MDA-MB-231 cells into the cardiac ventricle and followed for progression of bone metastases. Five weeks after tumor cell inoculation, tumor-induced osteolytic lesion area was increased in OVX-Let mice and reduced in OVX-Let-Zol mice compared to sham-vehicle. Tumor burden in bone was increased in OVX-Let mice relative to sham-vehicle and OVX-Let-Zol mice. At the termination of the study, muscle-specific force of the extensor digitorum longus muscle was reduced in OVX-Let mice compared to sham-vehicle mice, however, the addition of Zol improved muscle function. In summary, AI treatment induced bone loss and skeletal muscle weakness, recapitulating effects observed in cancer patients. Prevention of AI-induced osteoclastic bone resorption using a bisphosphonate attenuated the development of breast cancer bone metastases and improved muscle function in mice. These findings highlight the bone microenvironment as a modulator of tumor growth locally and muscle function systemically.",

        "Abstract": "The type-1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is an intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) release channel required for skeletal muscle contraction. Here, we present cryo-EM reconstructions of RyR1 in multiple functional states revealing the structural basis of channel gating and ligand-dependent activation. Binding sites for the channel activators Ca(2+), ATP, and caffeine were identified at interdomain interfaces of the C-terminal domain. Either ATP or Ca(2+) alone induces conformational changes in the cytoplasmic assembly (\"priming\"), without pore dilation. In contrast, in the presence of all three activating ligands, high-resolution reconstructions of open and closed states of RyR1 were obtained from the same sample, enabling analyses of conformational changes associated with\u00a0gating. Gating involves global conformational changes in the cytosolic assembly accompanied by local changes in the transmembrane domain, which include bending of the S6 transmembrane segment and consequent pore dilation, displacement, and deformation of the S4-S5 linker and conformational changes in the pseudo-voltage-sensor domain.",

        "Title": "Leaky ryanodine receptors contribute to diaphragmatic weakness during mechanical ventilation.",
        "Abstract": "Ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD) refers to the diaphragm muscle weakness that occurs following prolonged controlled mechanical ventilation (MV). The presence of VIDD impedes recovery from respiratory failure. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms accounting for VIDD are still not fully understood. Here, we show in human subjects and a mouse model of VIDD that MV is associated with rapid remodeling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR1) in the diaphragm. The RyR1 macromolecular complex was oxidized, S-nitrosylated, Ser-2844 phosphorylated, and depleted of the stabilizing subunit calstabin1, following MV. These posttranslational modifications of RyR1 were mediated by both oxidative stress mediated by MV and stimulation of adrenergic signaling resulting from the anesthesia. We demonstrate in the murine model that such abnormal resting SR Ca(2+) leak resulted in reduced contractile function and muscle fiber atrophy for longer duration of MV. Treatment with \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists or with S107, a small molecule drug that stabilizes the RyR1-calstabin1 interaction, prevented VIDD. Diaphragmatic dysfunction is common in MV patients and is a major cause of failure to wean patients from ventilator support. This study provides the first evidence to our knowledge of RyR1 alterations as a proximal mechanism underlying VIDD (i.e., loss of function, muscle atrophy) and identifies RyR1 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.",

        "Title": "Maintenance of normal blood pressure is dependent on IP3R1-mediated regulation of eNOS.",
        "Abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) are critical mediators of blood pressure (BP) regulation, primarily via the generation and release of vasorelaxants, including nitric oxide (NO). NO is produced in ECs by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), which is activated by both calcium (Ca(2+))-dependent and independent pathways. Here, we report that intracellular Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) is required for Ca(2+)-dependent eNOS activation. EC-specific type 1 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor knockout (IP3R1(-/-)) mice are hypertensive and display blunted vasodilation in response to acetylcholine (ACh). Moreover, eNOS activity is reduced in both isolated IP3R1-deficient murine ECs and human ECs following IP3R1 knockdown. IP3R1 is upstream of calcineurin, a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-activated serine/threonine protein phosphatase. We show here that the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway is less active and eNOS levels are decreased in IP3R1-deficient ECs. Furthermore, the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A, whose use has been associated with the development of hypertension, reduces eNOS activity and vasodilation following ACh stimulation. Our results demonstrate that IP3R1 plays a crucial role in the EC-mediated vasorelaxation and the maintenance of normal BP.",

Images of Chernobyl are replete with the international sign of radioactive contamination (a circle with three broad spokes radiating outward in a yellow sign). In contrast, ongoing decontamination efforts at Fukushima lack international warnings about radioactivity. Decontamination workers at Fukushima appear to be poorly protected against radiation. It is almost as if the effort is to make the Fukushima problem disappear. A more useful response would be to openly acknowledge the monumental problems inherent in managing a nuclear plant disaster. Lessons from Chernobyl are the best predictors of what the Fukushima region of Japan is coping with in terms of health and environmental problems following a nuclear catastrophe.",

We found that transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, released from the bone surface as a result of metastasis-induced bone destruction, upregulated NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), resulting in elevated oxidization of skeletal muscle proteins, including the ryanodine receptor and calcium (Ca(2+)) release channel (RyR1). The oxidized RyR1 channels leaked Ca(2+), resulting in lower intracellular signaling, which is required for proper muscle contraction. We found that inhibiting RyR1 leakage, TGF-\u03b2 signaling, TGF-\u03b2 release from bone or Nox4 activity improved muscle function in mice with MDA-MB-231 bone metastases. Humans with breast- or lung cancer-associated bone metastases also had oxidized skeletal muscle RyR1 that is not seen in normal muscle. Similarly, skeletal muscle weakness, increased Nox4 binding to RyR1 and oxidation of RyR1 were present in a mouse model of Camurati-Engelmann disease, a nonmalignant metabolic bone disorder associated with increased TGF-\u03b2 activity. Thus, pathological TGF-\u03b2 release from bone contributes to muscle weakness by decreasing Ca(2+)-induced muscle force production.",

        "Title": "Mitochondrial calcium overload is a key determinant in heart failure.",
        "Abstract": "Calcium (Ca2+) released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is crucial for excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. Mitochondria, the major source of energy, in the form of ATP, required for cardiac contractility, are closely interconnected with the SR, and Ca2+ is essential for optimal function of these organelles. However, Ca2+ accumulation can impair mitochondrial function, leading to reduced ATP production and increased release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative stress contributes to heart failure (HF), but whether mitochondrial Ca2+ plays a mechanistic role in HF remains unresolved. Here, we show for the first time, to our knowledge, that diastolic SR Ca2+ leak causes mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and dysfunction in a murine model of postmyocardial infarction HF. There are two forms of Ca2+ release channels on cardiac SR: type 2 ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) and type 2 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R2s). Using murine models harboring RyR2 mutations that either cause or inhibit SR Ca2+ leak, we found that leaky RyR2 channels result in mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, dysmorphology, and malfunction. In contrast, cardiac-specific deletion of IP3R2 had no major effect on mitochondrial fitness in HF. Moreover, genetic enhancement of mitochondrial antioxidant activity improved mitochondrial function and reduced posttranslational modifications of RyR2 macromolecular complex. Our data demonstrate that leaky RyR2, but not IP3R2, channels cause mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and dysfunction in HF.",

        "Abstract": "Oxidative stress has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). Indeed, the prevalence of AF increases with age as does oxidative stress. However, the mechanisms linking redox state to AF are not well understood. In this study we identify a link between oxidative stress and aberrant intracellular Ca(2+) release via the type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) that promotes AF. We show that RyR2 are oxidized in the atria of patients with chronic AF compared with individuals in sinus rhythm. To dissect the molecular mechanism linking RyR2 oxidation to AF we used two murine models harboring RyR2 mutations that cause intracellular Ca(2+) leak. Mice with intracellular Ca(2+) leak exhibited increased atrial RyR2 oxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and AF susceptibility. Both genetic inhibition of mitochondrial ROS production and pharmacological treatment of RyR2 leakage prevented AF. Collectively, our results indicate that alterations of RyR2 and mitochondrial ROS generation form a vicious cycle in the development of AF. Targeting this previously unrecognized mechanism could be useful in developing effective interventions to prevent and treat AF.",

        "Abstract": "The type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is a Ca2+ release channel on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of several types of cells, including cardiomyocytes and pancreatic \u03b2 cells. In cardiomyocytes, RyR2-dependent Ca2+ release is critical for excitation-contraction coupling; however, a functional role for RyR2 in \u03b2 cell insulin secretion and diabetes mellitus remains controversial. Here, we took advantage of rare RyR2 mutations that were identified in patients with a genetic form of exercise-induced sudden death (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [CPVT]). As these mutations result in a \"leaky\" RyR2 channel, we exploited them to assess RyR2 channel function in \u03b2 cell dynamics. We discovered that CPVT patients with mutant leaky RyR2 present with glucose intolerance, which was heretofore unappreciated. In mice, transgenic expression of CPVT-associated RyR2 resulted in impaired glucose homeostasis, and an in-depth evaluation of pancreatic islets and \u03b2 cells from these animals revealed intracellular Ca2+ leak via oxidized and nitrosylated RyR2 channels, activated ER stress response, mitochondrial dysfunction, and decreased fuel-stimulated insulin release. Additionally, we verified the effects of the pharmacological inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ leak in CPVT-associated RyR2-expressing mice, in human islets from diabetic patients, and in an established murine model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Taken together, our data indicate that RyR2 channels play a crucial role in the regulation of insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) mediate the rapid release of calcium (Ca(2+)) from intracellular stores into the cytosol, which is essential for numerous cellular functions including excitation-contraction coupling in muscle. Lack of sufficient structural detail has impeded understanding of RyR gating and regulation. Here we report the closed-state structure of the 2.3-megadalton complex of the rabbit skeletal muscle type 1 RyR (RyR1), solved by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at an overall resolution of 4.8\u00a0\u00c5. We fitted a polyalanine-level model to all 3,757 ordered residues in each protomer, defining the transmembrane pore in unprecedented detail and placing all cytosolic domains as tertiary folds. The cytosolic assembly is built on an extended \u03b1-solenoid scaffold connecting key regulatory domains to the pore. The RyR1 pore architecture places it in the six-transmembrane ion channel superfamily. A unique domain inserted between the second and third transmembrane helices interacts intimately with paired EF-hands originating from the \u03b1-solenoid scaffold, suggesting a mechanism for channel gating by Ca(2+).",

        "Abstract": "Age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction is a leading cause of morbidity that affects up to half the population aged 80 or greater. Here we tested the effects of increased mitochondrial antioxidant activity on age-dependent skeletal muscle dysfunction using transgenic mice with targeted overexpression of the human catalase gene to mitochondria (MCat mice). Aged MCat mice exhibited improved voluntary exercise, increased skeletal muscle specific force and tetanic Ca(2+) transients, decreased intracellular Ca(2+) leak and increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) load compared with age-matched wild type (WT) littermates. Furthermore, ryanodine receptor 1 (the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release channel required for skeletal muscle contraction; RyR1) from aged MCat mice was less oxidized, depleted of the channel stabilizing subunit, calstabin1, and displayed increased single channel open probability (Po). Overall, these data indicate a direct role for mitochondrial free radicals in promoting the pathological intracellular Ca(2+) leak that underlies age-dependent loss of skeletal muscle function. This study harbors implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies, including mitochondria-targeted antioxidants for treatment of mitochondrial myopathies and other healthspan-limiting disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Drugs currently approved to coat stents used in percutaneous coronary interventions do not discriminate between proliferating vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs). This lack of discrimination delays reendothelialization and vascular healing, increasing the risk of late thrombosis following angioplasty. We developed a microRNA-based (miRNA-based) approach to inhibit proliferative VSMCs, thus preventing restenosis, while selectively promoting reendothelialization and preserving EC function. We used an adenoviral (Ad) vector that encodes cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) (p27) with target sequences for EC-specific miR-126-3p at the 3' end (Ad-p27-126TS). Exogenous p27 overexpression was evaluated in vitro and in a rat arterial balloon injury model following transduction with Ad-p27-126TS, Ad-p27 (without miR-126 target sequences), or Ad-GFP (control). In vitro, Ad-p27-126TS protected the ability of ECs to proliferate, migrate, and form networks. At 2 and 4 weeks after injury, Ad-p27-126TS-treated animals exhibited reduced restenosis, complete reendothelialization, reduced hypercoagulability, and restoration of the vasodilatory response to acetylcholine to levels comparable to those in uninjured vessels. By incorporating miR-126-3p target sequences to leverage endogenous EC-specific miR-126, we overexpressed exogenous p27 in VSMCs, while selectively inhibiting p27 overexpression in ECs. Our proof-of-principle study demonstrates the potential of using a miRNA-based strategy as a therapeutic approach to specifically inhibit vascular restenosis while preserving EC function.",

        "Abstract": "Abnormalities in intracellular Ca(2+) signaling have been proposed to play an essential role in the pathophysiology of atrial arrhythmias. However, a direct observation of intracellular Ca(2+) in atrial myocytes during atrial arrhythmias is lacking. Here, we have developed an ex vivo model of simultaneous Ca(2+) imaging and electrocardiographic recording in cardiac atria. Using this system we were able to record atrial arrhythmic intracellular Ca(2+) activities. Our results indicate that atrial arrhythmias can be tightly linked to intracellular Ca(2+) waves and Ca(2+) alternans. Moreover, we applied this strategy to analyze Ca(2+) signals in the hearts of WT and knock-in mice harboring a 'leaky' type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2-R2474S). We showed that sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) leak increases the susceptibility to Ca(2+) alternans and Ca(2+) waves increasing the incidence of atrial arrhythmias. Reduction of SR Ca(2+) leak via RyR2 by acute treatment with S107 reduced both Ca(2+) alternans and Ca(2+) waves, and prevented atrial arrhythmias.",

        "Title": "Manipulating L-type calcium channels in cardiomyocytes using split-intein protein transsplicing.",
        "Abstract": "Manipulating expression of large genes (>6 kb) in adult cardiomyocytes is challenging because these cells are only efficiently transduced by viral vectors with a 4-7 kb packaging capacity. This limitation impedes understanding structure-function mechanisms of important proteins in heart. L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) regulate diverse facets of cardiac physiology including excitation-contraction coupling, excitability, and gene expression. Many important questions about how LTCCs mediate such multidimensional signaling are best resolved by manipulating expression of the 6.6 kb pore-forming \u03b11C-subunit in adult cardiomyocytes. Here, we use split-intein-mediated protein transsplicing to reconstitute LTCC \u03b11C-subunit from two distinct halves, overcoming the difficulty of expressing full-length \u03b11C in cardiomyocytes. Split-intein-tagged \u03b11C fragments encoding dihydropyridine-resistant channels were incorporated into adenovirus and reconstituted in cardiomyocytes. Similar to endogenous LTCCs, recombinant channels targeted to dyads, triggered Ca(2+) transients, associated with caveolin-3, and supported \u03b2-adrenergic regulation of excitation-contraction coupling. This approach lowers a longstanding technical hurdle to manipulating large proteins in cardiomyocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Large conductance voltage- and calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels are highly expressed in airway smooth muscle (ASM). Utilizing the ovalbumin (OVA) and house dust mite (HDM) models of asthma in C57BL/6 mice, we demonstrate that systemic administration of the BK channel agonist rottlerin (5 \u03bcg/g) during the challenge period reduced methacholine-induced airway hyperreactivity (AHR) in OVA- and HDM-sensitized mice (47% decrease in peak airway resistance in OVA-asthma animals, P<0.01; 54% decrease in HDM-asthma animals, P<0.01) with a 35-40% reduction in inflammatory cells and 20-35% reduction in Th2 cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Intravenous rottlerin (5 \u03bcg/g) reduced AHR within 5 min in the OVA-asthma mice by 45% (P<0.01). With the use of an ex vivo lung slice technique, rottlerin relaxed acetylcholine-stimulated murine airway lumen area to 87 \u00b1 4% of the precontracted area (P<0.01 vs. DMSO control). Rottlerin increased BK channel activity in human ASM cells (V50 shifted by 73.5\u00b113.5 and 71.8\u00b114.6 mV in control and asthmatic cells, respectively, both P<0.05 as compared with pretreatment) and reduced the frequency of acetylcholine-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in murine ex vivo lung slices. These findings suggest that rottlerin, with both anti-inflammatory and ASM relaxation properties, may have benefit in treating asthma.",

        "Abstract": "Calcium dependent signaling is highly regulated in cardiomyocytes and determines the force of cardiac muscle contraction. The cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2) play important roles in health and disease. Modulation of RyR2 by phosphorylation is required for sympathetic regulation of cardiac function. Abnormal regulation of RyR2 contributes to heart failure, and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. RyR2 channels are oxidized, nitrosylated, and hyperphosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) in heart failure, resulting in \"leaky\" channels. These leaky RyR2 channels contribute to depletion of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in defective cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. In this review, we discuss both the importance of PKA and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) regulation of RyR2 in health, and how altered phosphorylation, nitrosylation and oxidation of RyR2 channels lead to cardiac disease. Correcting these defects using either genetic manipulation (knock-in) in mice, or specific and novel small molecules ameliorates the RyR2 dysfunction, reducing the progression to heart failure and the incidence of arrhythmias.",

        "Abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central regulator of cell proliferation that is often deregulated in cancer. Inhibitors of mTOR, including rapamycin and its analogues, are being evaluated as antitumor agents. For their promise to be fulfilled, it is of paramount importance to identify the mechanisms of resistance and develop novel therapies to overcome it. Given the emerging role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in tumorigenesis, we hypothesized that miRNAs could play important roles in the response of tumors to mTOR inhibitors. Long-term rapamycin treatment showed extensive reprogramming of miRNA expression, characterized by up-regulation of miR-17-92 and related clusters and down-regulation of tumor suppressor miRNAs. Inhibition of members of the miR-17-92 clusters or delivery of tumor suppressor miRNAs restored sensitivity to rapamycin. This study identifies miRNAs as new downstream components of the mTOR-signaling pathway, which may determine the response of tumors to mTOR inhibitors. It also identifies potential markers to assess the efficacy of treatment and provides novel therapeutic targets to treat rapamycin-resistant tumors.",

        "Abstract": "Ca2+-dependent signaling is highly regulated in cardiomyocytes and determines the force of cardiac muscle contraction. Ca2+ cycling refers to the release and reuptake of intracellular Ca2+ that drives muscle contraction and relaxation. In failing hearts, Ca2+ cycling is profoundly altered, resulting in impaired contractility and fatal cardiac arrhythmias. The key defects in Ca2+ cycling occur at the level of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a Ca2+ storage organelle in muscle. Defects in the regulation of Ca2+ cycling proteins including the ryanodine receptor 2, cardiac (RyR2)/Ca2+ release channel macromolecular complexes and the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2a (SERCA2a)/phospholamban complex contribute to heart failure. RyR2s are oxidized, nitrosylated, and PKA hyperphosphorylated, resulting in \"leaky\" channels in failing hearts. These leaky RyR2s contribute to depletion of Ca2+ from the SR, and the leaking Ca2+ depolarizes cardiomyocytes and triggers fatal arrhythmias. SERCA2a is downregulated and phospholamban is hypophosphorylated in failing hearts, resulting in impaired SR Ca2+ reuptake that conspires with leaky RyR2 to deplete SR Ca2+. Two new therapeutic strategies for heart failure (HF) are now being tested in clinical trials: (a) fixing the leak in RyR2 channels with a novel class of Ca2+-release channel stabilizers called Rycals and (b) increasing expression of SERCA2a to improve SR Ca2+ reuptake with viral-mediated gene therapy. There are many potential opportunities for additional mechanism-based therapeutics involving the machinery that regulates Ca2+ cycling in the heart.",

Despite extensive study, the molecular mechanism underlying the inotropic response in skeletal muscle is not well understood. Here we show that phosphorylation of a single serine residue (S2844) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release channel/ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) by protein kinase A (PKA) is critical for skeletal muscle inotropy. Treating fast twitch skeletal muscle from wild-type mice with the \u03b2-receptor agonist isoproterenol (isoprenaline) increased RyR1 PKA phosphorylation, twitch Ca(2+) and force generation. In contrast, the enhanced muscle Ca(2+), force and in vivo muscle strength responses following isoproterenol stimulation were abrogated in RyR1-S2844A mice in which the serine in the PKA site in RyR1 was replaced with alanine. These data suggest that the molecular mechanism underlying skeletal muscle inotropy requires enhanced SR Ca(2+) release due to PKA phosphorylation of S2844 in RyR1.",

        "Abstract": "The type 2 ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel (RyR2), required for excitation-contraction coupling in the heart, is abundant in the brain. Chronic stress induces catecholamine biosynthesis and release, stimulating \u03b2-adrenergic receptors and activating cAMP signaling pathways in neurons. In a murine chronic restraint stress model, neuronal RyR2 were phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA), oxidized, and nitrosylated, resulting in depletion of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) from the channel complex and intracellular calcium leak. Stress-induced cognitive dysfunction, including deficits in learning and memory, and reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) at the hippocampal CA3-CA1 connection were rescued by oral administration of S107, a compound developed in our laboratory that stabilizes RyR2-calstabin2 interaction, or by genetic ablation of the RyR2 PKA phosphorylation site at serine 2808. Thus, neuronal RyR2 remodeling contributes to stress-induced cognitive dysfunction. Leaky RyR2 could be a therapeutic target for treatment of stress-induced cognitive dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "Disruption of the sarcolemma-associated dystrophin-glycoprotein complex underlies multiple forms of muscular dystrophy, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy and sarcoglycanopathies. A hallmark of these disorders is muscle weakness. In a murine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, mdx mice, cysteine-nitrosylation of the calcium release channel/ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) on the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum causes depletion of the stabilizing subunit calstabin1 (FKBP12) from the RyR1 macromolecular complex. This results in a sarcoplasmic reticular calcium leak via defective RyR1 channels. This pathological intracellular calcium leak contributes to reduced calcium release and decreased muscle force production. It is unknown whether RyR1 dysfunction occurs also in other muscular dystrophies.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatic glucose production (HGP) is crucial for glucose homeostasis, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that a calcium-sensing enzyme, CaMKII, is activated in a calcium- and IP3R-dependent manner by cAMP and glucagon in primary hepatocytes and by glucagon and fasting in vivo. Genetic deficiency or inhibition of CaMKII blocks nuclear translocation of FoxO1 by affecting its phosphorylation, impairs fasting- and glucagon/cAMP-induced glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and lowers blood glucose levels, while constitutively active CaMKII has the opposite effects. Importantly, the suppressive effect of CaMKII deficiency on glucose metabolism is abrogated by transduction with constitutively nuclear FoxO1, indicating that the effect of CaMKII deficiency requires nuclear exclusion of FoxO1. This same pathway is also involved in excessive HGP in the setting of obesity. These results reveal a calcium-mediated signaling pathway involved in FoxO1 nuclear localization and hepatic glucose homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a role in controlling malignant cellular growth. mTOR inhibitors, including rapamycin (sirolimus), are currently being evaluated in cancer trials. However, a significant number of tumors are rapamycin resistant. In this study, we report that the ability of rapamycin to downregulate Skp2, a subunit of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex, identifies tumors that are sensitive to rapamycin. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of Skp2 in human tumor cells increased their sensitivity to rapamycin in vitro and inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts in vivo. Our findings suggest that Skp2 levels are a key determinant of antitumor responses to mTOR inhibitors, highlighting a potentially important pharmacogenomic marker to predict sensitivity to rapamycin as well as Skp2 silencing strategies for therapeutic purposes.",

        "Title": "Decreased cardiac L-type Ca\u00b2\u207a channel activity induces hypertrophy and heart failure in mice.",
        "Abstract": "Antagonists of L-type Ca\u00b2\u207a channels (LTCCs) have been used to treat human cardiovascular diseases for decades. However, these inhibitors can have untoward effects in patients with heart failure, and their overall therapeutic profile remains nebulous given differential effects in the vasculature when compared with those in cardiomyocytes. To investigate this issue, we examined mice heterozygous for the gene encoding the pore-forming subunit of LTCC (calcium channel, voltage-dependent, L type, \u03b11C subunit [Cacna1c mice; referred to herein as \u03b11C\u207b/\u207a mice]) and mice in which this gene was loxP targeted to achieve graded heart-specific gene deletion (termed herein \u03b11C-loxP mice). Adult cardiomyocytes from the hearts of \u03b11C\u207b/\u207a mice at 10 weeks of age showed a decrease in LTCC current and a modest decrease in cardiac function, which we initially hypothesized would be cardioprotective. However, \u03b11C\u207b/\u207a mice subjected to pressure overload stimulation, isoproterenol infusion, and swimming showed greater cardiac hypertrophy, greater reductions in ventricular performance, and greater ventricular dilation than \u03b11C\u207a/\u207a controls. The same detrimental effects were observed in \u03b11C-loxP animals with a cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of one allele. More severe reductions in \u03b11C protein levels with combinatorial deleted alleles produced spontaneous cardiac hypertrophy before 3 months of age, with early adulthood lethality. Mechanistically, our data suggest that a reduction in LTCC current leads to neuroendocrine stress, with sensitized and leaky sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca\u00b2\u207a release as a compensatory mechanism to preserve contractility. This state results in calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells signaling that promotes hypertrophy and disease.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies indicate that members of the multidrug-resistance protein (MRP) family belonging to ATP binding cassette type C (ABCC) membrane proteins extrude cyclic nucleotides from various cell types. This study aimed to determine whether MRP proteins regulate cardiac cAMP homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that MRP4 is the predominant isoform present at the plasma membrane of cardiacmyocytes and that it mediates the efflux of cAMP in these cells. MRP4-deficient mice displayed enhanced cardiac myocyte cAMP formation, contractility, and cardiac hypertrophy at 9 mo of age, an effect that was compensated transiently by increased phosphodiesterase expression at young age. These findings suggest that cAMP extrusion via MRP4 acts together with phosphodiesterases to control cAMP levels in cardiac myocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Age-related loss of muscle mass and force (sarcopenia) contributes to disability and increased mortality. Ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) is the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel required for muscle contraction. RyR1 from aged (24\u00a0months) rodents was oxidized, cysteine-nitrosylated, and depleted of the channel-stabilizing subunit calstabin1, compared to RyR1 from younger (3-6\u00a0months) adults. This RyR1 channel complex remodeling resulted in \"leaky\" channels with increased open probability, leading to intracellular calcium leak in skeletal muscle. Similarly, 6-month-old mice harboring leaky RyR1-S2844D mutant channels exhibited skeletal muscle defects comparable to 24-month-old wild-type mice. Treating aged mice with S107 stabilized binding of calstabin1 to RyR1, reduced intracellular calcium leak, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and enhanced tetanic Ca(2+) release, muscle-specific force, and exercise capacity. Taken together, these data indicate that leaky RyR1 contributes to age-related loss of muscle function.",

        "Title": "Ryanodine receptor leak mediated by caspase-8 activation leads to left ventricular injury after myocardial ischemia-reperfusion.",
        "Abstract": "Myocardial ischemic disease is the major cause of death worldwide. After myocardial infarction, reperfusion of infracted heart has been an important objective of strategies to improve outcomes. However, cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is characterized by inflammation, arrhythmias, cardiomyocyte damage, and, at the cellular level, disturbance in Ca(2+) and redox homeostasis. In this study, we sought to determine how acute inflammatory response contributes to reperfusion injury and Ca(2+) homeostasis disturbance after acute ischemia. Using a rat model of I/R, we show that circulating levels of TNF-\u03b1 and cardiac caspase-8 activity were increased within 6 h of reperfusion, leading to myocardial nitric oxide and mitochondrial ROS production. At 1 and 15 d after reperfusion, caspase-8 activation resulted in S-nitrosylation of the RyR2 and depletion of calstabin2 from the RyR2 complex, resulting in diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) leak. Pharmacological inhibition of caspase-8 before reperfusion with Q-LETD-OPh or prevention of calstabin2 depletion from the RyR2 complex with the Ca(2+) channel stabilizer S107 (\"rycal\") inhibited the SR Ca(2+) leak, reduced ventricular arrhythmias, infarct size, and left ventricular remodeling after 15 d of reperfusion. TNF-\u03b1-induced caspase-8 activation leads to leaky RyR2 channels that contribute to myocardial remodeling after I/R. Thus, early prevention of SR Ca(2+) leak trough normalization of RyR2 function is cardioprotective.",

        "Abstract": "A critical component in regulating cardiac and skeletal muscle contractility is the release of Ca(2+) via ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca(2+) release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). In heart failure and myopathy, the RyR has been found to be excessively phosphorylated or nitrosylated and depleted of the RyR-stabilizing protein calstabin (FK506 binding protein 12/12.6). This remodeling of the RyR channel complex results in an intracellular SR Ca(2+) leak and impaired contractility. Despite recent advances in heart failure treatment, there are still devastatingly high mortality rates with this disease. Moreover, pharmacological treatment for muscle weakness and myopathy is nearly nonexistent. A novel class of RyR-stabilizing drugs, rycals, which reduce Ca(2+) leak by stabilizing the RyR channels due to preservation of the RyR-calstabin interaction, have recently been shown to improve contractile function in both heart and skeletal muscle. This opens up a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of contractile failure in the cardiac and skeletal muscle.",

        "Abstract": "During the classic \"fight-or-flight\" stress response, sympathetic nervous system activation leads to catecholamine release, which increases heart rate and contractility, resulting in enhanced cardiac output. Catecholamines bind to \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, causing cAMP generation and activation of PKA, which phosphorylates multiple targets in cardiac muscle, including the cardiac ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel (RyR2) required for muscle contraction. PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 enhances channel activity by sensitizing the channel to cytosolic calcium (Ca\u00b2+). Here, we found that mice harboring RyR2 channels that cannot be PKA phosphorylated (referred to herein as RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice) exhibited blunted heart rate and cardiac contractile responses to catecholamines (isoproterenol). The isoproterenol-induced enhancement of ventricular myocyte Ca\u00b2+ transients and fractional shortening (contraction) and the spontaneous beating rate of sinoatrial nodal cells were all blunted in RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice. The blunted cardiac response to catecholamines in RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice resulted in impaired exercise capacity. RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice were protected against chronic catecholaminergic-induced cardiac dysfunction. These studies identify what we believe to be new roles for PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in both the heart rate and contractile responses to acute catecholaminergic stimulation.",

        "Abstract": "Increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak via the cardiac ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel (RyR2) is thought to play a role in heart failure (HF) progression. Inhibition of this leak is an emerging therapeutic strategy. To explore the role of chronic PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in HF pathogenesis and treatment, we generated a knockin mouse with aspartic acid replacing serine 2808 (mice are referred to herein as RyR2-S2808D+/+ mice). This mutation mimics constitutive PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2, which causes depletion of the stabilizing subunit FKBP12.6 (also known as calstabin2), resulting in leaky RyR2. RyR2-S2808D+/+ mice developed age-dependent cardiomyopathy, elevated RyR2 oxidation and nitrosylation, reduced SR Ca2+ store content, and increased diastolic SR Ca2+ leak. After myocardial infarction, RyR2-S2808D+/+ mice exhibited increased mortality compared with WT littermates. Treatment with S107, a 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative that stabilizes RyR2-calstabin2 interactions, inhibited the RyR2-mediated diastolic SR Ca2+ leak and reduced HF progression in WT and RyR2-S2808D+/+ mice. In contrast, \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockers improved cardiac function in WT but not in RyR2-S2808D+/+ mice.Thus, chronic PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 results in a diastolic leak that causes cardiac dysfunction. Reversing PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 is an important mechanism underlying the therapeutic action of \u03b2-blocker therapy in HF.",

Patients with heart failure suffer from dyspnea and decreased exercised tolerance and are at increased risk for fatal ventricular arrhythmias. Food and Drug Administration -approved pharmacologic therapies for heart failure include diuretics, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonists. Over the past 20 years advances in the field of ryanodine receptor (RyR2)/calcium release channel research have greatly advanced our understanding of cardiac physiology and the pathogenesis of heart failure and arrhythmias. Here we review the key observations, controversies, and discoveries that have led to the development of novel compounds targeting the RyR2/calcium release channel for treating heart failure and for preventing lethal arrhythmias.",

        "Abstract": "The force frequency relationship (FFR), first described by Bowditch 139 years ago as the observation that myocardial contractility increases proportionally with increasing heart rate, is an important mediator of enhanced cardiac output during exercise. Individuals with heart failure have defective positive FFR that impairs their cardiac function in response to stress, and the degree of positive FFR deficiency correlates with heart failure progression. We have identified a mechanism for FFR involving heart rate dependent phosphorylation of the major cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR2), at Ser2814, by calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase-delta (CaMKIIdelta). Mice engineered with an RyR2-S2814A mutation have RyR2 channels that cannot be phosphorylated by CaMKIIdelta, and exhibit a blunted positive FFR. Ex vivo hearts from RyR2-S2814A mice also have blunted positive FFR, and cardiomyocytes isolated from the RyR2-S2814A mice exhibit impaired rate-dependent enhancement of cytosolic calcium levels and fractional shortening. The cardiac RyR2 macromolecular complexes isolated from murine and human failing hearts have reduced CaMKIIdelta levels. These data indicate that CaMKIIdelta phosphorylation of RyR2 plays an important role in mediating positive FFR in the heart, and that defective regulation of RyR2 by CaMKIIdelta-mediated phosphorylation is associated with the loss of positive FFR in failing hearts.",

        "Abstract": "Ryanodine receptors (RyR) regulate intracellular Ca(2+) release in many cell types and have been implicated in a number of inherited human diseases. Over the past 15 years genetically engineered mouse models have been developed to elucidate the role that RyRs play in physiology and pathophysiology. To date these models have implicated RyRs in fundamental biological processes including excitation-contraction coupling and long term plasticity as well as diseases including malignant hyperthermia, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and seizures. In this review we summarize the RyR mouse models and how they have enhanced our understanding of the RyR channels and their roles in cellular physiology and disease.",

        "Abstract": "Ryanodine receptors (RyR) are intracellular Ca2+-permeable channels that provide the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release required for skeletal and cardiac muscle contractions. RyR1 underlies skeletal muscle contraction, and RyR2 fulfills this role in cardiac muscle. Over the past 20 years, numerous mutations in both RyR isoforms have been identified and linked to skeletal and cardiac diseases. Malignant hyperthermia, central core disease, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia have been genetically linked to mutations in either RyR1 or RyR2. Thus, RyR channelopathies are both of interest because they cause significant human diseases and provide model systems that can be studied to elucidate important structure-function relationships of these ion channels.",

        "Title": "Rapamycin regulates endothelial cell migration through regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1.",
        "Abstract": "Rapamycin is a macrolide antibiotic that inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration and that is used clinically on drug-eluting stents to inhibit in-stent restenosis. Although inhibition of cell migration is an asset in preventing restenosis, it also leads to impaired stent endothelialization, a significant limitation of current drug-eluting stent technology that necessitates prolonged antiplatelet therapy. We measured the ability of rapamycin to inhibit the migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) toward the chemoattractant vascular endothelial cell growth factor. Although acute administration of rapamycin had no effect, exposure for 24 h inhibited HUVEC and HCAEC migration. Disruption of the mTORC2 via small interfering RNA was also effective in inhibiting HCAEC migration. Treatment of HCAECs for this period with rapamycin produced an increase in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip), through a decrease in the targeting of the protein for degradation by phosphorylation at Thr(187). ECs isolated from a knock-in mouse expressing p27(Kip1) with a mutation of this residue to an alanine, blocking this phosphorylation, exhibited reduced migration compared with wild-type controls. Silencing of p27(Kip1) with small interfering RNA blocked the effects of rapamycin on migration and tube formation as well as RhoA activation and cytoskeletal reorganization. We conclude that prolonged exposure of ECs to rapamycin increases p27(Kip1) and in turn inhibits RhoA activation, blocking cell migration and differentiation. These data elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying regulation of p27(Kip1) protein and cell migration by rapamycin.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) have a progressive dilated cardiomyopathy associated with fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Electrical and functional abnormalities have been attributed to cardiac fibrosis; however, electrical abnormalities may occur in the absence of overt cardiac histopathology. Here we show that structural and functional remodeling of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR2) occurs in the mdx mouse model of DMD. RyR2 from mdx hearts were S-nitrosylated and depleted of calstabin2 (FKBP12.6), resulting in \"leaky\" RyR2 channels and a diastolic SR Ca(2+) leak. Inhibiting the depletion of calstabin2 from the RyR2 complex with the Ca(2+) channel stabilizer S107 (\"rycal\") inhibited the SR Ca(2+) leak, inhibited aberrant depolarization in isolated cardiomyocytes, and prevented arrhythmias in vivo. This suggests that diastolic SR Ca(2+) leak via RyR2 due to S-nitrosylation of the channel and calstabin2 depletion from the channel complex likely triggers cardiac arrhythmias. Normalization of the RyR2-mediated diastolic SR Ca(2+) leak prevents fatal sudden cardiac arrhythmias in DMD.",

        "Abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis is involved in many diseases, but the mechanisms linking ER stress to apoptosis are incompletely understood. Based on roles for C/EPB homologous protein (CHOP) and ER calcium release in apoptosis, we hypothesized that apoptosis involves the activation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R) via CHOP-induced ERO1-alpha (ER oxidase 1 alpha). In ER-stressed cells, ERO1-alpha is induced by CHOP, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of ERO1-alpha suppresses apoptosis. IP3-induced calcium release (IICR) is increased during ER stress, and this response is blocked by siRNA-mediated silencing of ERO1-alpha or IP3R1 and by loss-of-function mutations in Ero1a or Chop. Reconstitution of ERO1-alpha in Chop(-/-) macrophages restores ER stress-induced IICR and apoptosis. In vivo, macrophages from wild-type mice but not Chop(-/-) mice have elevated IICR when the animals are challenged with the ER stressor tunicamycin. Macrophages from insulin-resistant ob/ob mice, another model of ER stress, also have elevated IICR. These data shed new light on how the CHOP pathway of apoptosis triggers calcium-dependent apoptosis through an ERO1-alpha-IP3R pathway.",

        "Title": "Hypernitrosylated ryanodine receptor calcium release channels are leaky in dystrophic muscle.",
        "Abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and early death resulting from dystrophin deficiency. Loss of dystrophin results in disruption of a large dystrophin glycoprotein complex, leading to pathological calcium (Ca2+)-dependent signals that damage muscle cells. We have identified a structural and functional defect in the ryanodine receptor (RyR1), a sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channel, in the mdx mouse model of muscular dystrophy that contributes to altered Ca2+ homeostasis in dystrophic muscles. RyR1 isolated from mdx skeletal muscle showed an age-dependent increase in S-nitrosylation coincident with dystrophic changes in the muscle. RyR1 S-nitrosylation depleted the channel complex of FKBP12 (also known as calstabin-1, for calcium channel stabilizing binding protein), resulting in 'leaky' channels. Preventing calstabin-1 depletion from RyR1 with S107, a compound that binds the RyR1 channel and enhances the binding affinity of calstabin-1 to the nitrosylated channel, inhibited sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak, reduced biochemical and histological evidence of muscle damage, improved muscle function and increased exercise performance in mdx mice. On the basis of these findings, we propose that sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak via RyR1 due to S-nitrosylation of the channel and calstabin-1 depletion contributes to muscle weakness in muscular dystrophy, and that preventing the RyR1-mediated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak may provide a new therapeutic approach.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the use of the sirolimus (rapamycin) drug-eluting coronary stent, diabetics are at increased risk of developing in-stent restenosis for unclear reasons. Hyperleptinemia, which often coexists with diabetes and metabolic syndrome, is an independent risk factor for progression of coronary artery disease. It has not been determined whether elevated circulating leptin decreases the efficacy of the sirolimus drug-eluting stent in inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia, the process underlying restenosis after stenting. Here we show that leptin activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in primary murine vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and stimulates VSMC proliferation in a PI3K-dependent fashion. Exogenous leptin, administered at levels comparable to those found in obese humans, promotes neointimal VSMC hyperplasia in a murine femoral artery wire injury model. Leptin significantly increases the dose of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus that is required for effective inhibition of neointimal formation. Combination therapy with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, and sirolimus effectively inhibits leptin-enhanced neointimal hyperplasia. These data show that, in the setting of hyperleptinemia, higher doses of an mTOR inhibitor, or combination therapy with mTOR and PI3K inhibitors, inhibits neointimal hyperplasia after arterial injury. These studies may explain the higher rates of restenosis observed in diabetics treated with a sirolimus-eluting coronary stent and suggest a potential novel therapeutic approach for inhibiting in-stent restenosis in such patients.",

        "Title": "Nonshivering thermogenesis protects against defective calcium handling in muscle.",
        "Abstract": "When acutely exposed to a cold environment, mammals shiver to generate heat. During prolonged cold exposure, shivering is replaced by adaptive adrenergic nonshivering thermogenesis with increased heat production in brown adipose tissue due to activation of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1). This cold acclimation is associated with chronically increased sympathetic stimulation of skeletal muscle, which may increase the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) leak via destabilized ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) channel complexes. Here, we use genetically engineered UCP1-deficient (UCP1-KO) mice that rely completely on shivering in the cold. We examine soleus muscle, which participates in shivering, and flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscle, a distal and superficial muscle that does not shiver. Soleus muscles of cold-acclimated UCP1-KO mice exhibited severe RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation and calstabin1 depletion, as well as markedly decreased SR Ca(2+) release and force during contractions. In stark contrast, the RyR1 channel complexes were little affected, and Ca(2+) and force were not decreased in FDB muscles of cold-acclimated UCP1-KO mice. These results indicate that activation of UCP1-mediated heat production in brown adipose tissue during cold exposure reduces the necessity for shivering and thus prevents the development of severe dysfunction in shivering muscles.",

        "Abstract": "The Ca2+ release channel ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) is required for excitation-contraction coupling in the heart and is also present in the brain. Mutations in RyR2 have been linked to exercise-induced sudden cardiac death (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [CPVT]). CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations result in \"leaky\" RyR2 channels due to the decreased binding of the calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) subunit, which stabilizes the closed state of the channel. We found that mice heterozygous for the R2474S mutation in Ryr2 (Ryr2-R2474S mice) exhibited spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures (which occurred in the absence of cardiac arrhythmias), exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Treatment with a novel RyR2-specific compound (S107) that enhances the binding of calstabin2 to the mutant Ryr2-R2474S channel inhibited the channel leak and prevented cardiac arrhythmias and raised the seizure threshold. Thus, CPVT-associated mutant leaky Ryr2-R2474S channels in the brain can cause seizures in mice, independent of cardiac arrhythmias. Based on these data, we propose that CPVT is a combined neurocardiac disorder in which leaky RyR2 channels in the brain cause epilepsy, and the same leaky channels in the heart cause exercise-induced sudden cardiac death.",

        "Abstract": "During exercise, defects in calcium (Ca2+) release have been proposed to impair muscle function. Here, we show that during exercise in mice and humans, the major Ca2+ release channel required for excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) in skeletal muscle, the ryanodine receptor (RyR1), is progressively PKA-hyperphosphorylated, S-nitrosylated, and depleted of the phosphodiesterase PDE4D3 and the RyR1 stabilizing subunit calstabin1 (FKBP12), resulting in \"leaky\" channels that cause decreased exercise tolerance in mice. Mice with skeletal muscle-specific calstabin1 deletion or PDE4D deficiency exhibited significantly impaired exercise capacity. A small molecule (S107) that prevents depletion of calstabin1 from the RyR1 complex improved force generation and exercise capacity, reduced Ca2+-dependent neutral protease calpain activity and plasma creatine kinase levels. Taken together, these data suggest a possible mechanism by which Ca2+ leak via calstabin1-depleted RyR1 channels leads to defective Ca2+ signaling, muscle damage, and impaired exercise capacity.",

        "Abstract": "Over the past century, understanding the mechanisms underlying muscle fatigue and weakness has been the focus of much investigation. However, the dominant theory in the field, that lactic acidosis causes muscle fatigue, is unlikely to tell the whole story. Recently, dysregulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release has been associated with impaired muscle function induced by a wide range of stressors, from dystrophy to heart failure to muscle fatigue. Here, we address current understandings of the altered regulation of SR Ca(2+) release during chronic stress, focusing on the role of the SR Ca(2+) release channel known as the type 1 ryanodine receptor.",

In many ways, aging can be considered the ultimate stress. However, physiological systems are constantly exposed to more acute stresses. Advances in our understanding of the molecular response of several physiological systems to both physiologic and pathologic stress is discussed in this Review Series. It is hoped that such understanding will facilitate the development of approaches to ameliorate some of the limitations these stresses place on individuals. However, as pointed out in many of the articles, much remains to be learned before such approaches can be envisioned.",

        "Abstract": "Sustained elevation of intracellular calcium by Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels is required for lymphocyte activation. Sustained Ca2+ entry requires endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ depletion and prolonged activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R)/Ca2+ release channels. However, a major isoform in lymphocyte ER, IP3R1, is inhibited by elevated levels of cytosolic Ca2+, and the mechanism that enables the prolonged activation of IP(3)R1 required for lymphocyte activation is unclear. We show that IP(3)R1 binds to the scaffolding protein linker of activated T cells and colocalizes with the T cell receptor during activation, resulting in persistent phosphorylation of IP(3)R1 at Tyr353. This phosphorylation increases the sensitivity of the channel to activation by IP(3) and renders the channel less sensitive to Ca2+ -induced inactivation. Expression of a mutant IP3R1-Y353F channel in lymphocytes causes defective Ca2+ signaling and decreased nuclear factor of activated T cells activation. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of IP3R1-Y353 may have an important function in maintaining elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels during lymphocyte activation.",

        "Abstract": "The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Office of Rare Diseases at the National Institutes of Health organized a workshop (September 14 to 15, 2006, in Bethesda, Md) to advise on new research directions needed for improved identification and treatment of rare inherited arrhythmias. These included the following: (1) Na+ channelopathies; (2) arrhythmias due to K+ channel mutations; and (3) arrhythmias due to other inherited arrhythmogenic mechanisms. Another major goal was to provide recommendations to support, enable, or facilitate research to improve future diagnosis and management of inherited arrhythmias. Classifications of electric heart diseases have proved to be exceedingly complex and in many respects contradictory. A new contemporary and rigorous classification of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies is proposed. This consensus report provides an important framework and overview to this increasingly heterogeneous group of primary cardiac membrane channel diseases. Of particular note, the present classification scheme recognizes the rapid evolution of molecular biology and novel therapeutic approaches in cardiology, as well as the introduction of many recently described diseases, and is unique in that it incorporates ion channelopathies as a primary cardiomyopathy in consensus with a recent American Heart Association Scientific Statement.",

The large cytoplasmic domain of the RyR serves as a scaffold for proteins that bind to and modulate the channel's function and that comprise a macromolecular signaling complex. These proteins include calstabins [FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs)], calmodulin (CaM), phosphodiesterase, kinases, phosphatases, and their cognate targeting proteins.

Physician-scientists conducted teaching rounds in the hospital, surrounded by eager house staff and medical students, and were often avidly pursued as the most important sources of new knowledge for trainees. But alas, times have changed. Now physician-scientists are rarely seen in the hospital; they are most often spotted at their desks tapping out yet another grant application. Most struggle to find the time to mentor students and clinical trainees, let alone to care for patients in the hospital, even though these interactions are often the motivating forces for scientific creativity.",

        "Abstract": "This review focuses on role played by two modulators of ryanodine receptors (RyRs), one a small molecule (1,4-benzothiazepine) and the other a protein subunit of the channel (FKBP or calstabin), both of which exert potent effects on the channel. These regulators of the RyR channels have potential therapeutic implications in that the small molecule and the protein have novel anti-arrhythmic and anti-heart failure activities involving the cardiac (RyR2) and skeletal (RyR1) ryanodine receptors. Protein kinase A (PKA) hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 in failing hearts or mutations in RyR2 linked to sudden cardiac death (SCD) can result in diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak that can trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias, and deplete SR Ca2+ stores contributing to decreased contractility. We and others have identified a class of small molecules derived from 1,4-benzothiazepines, that enhance the binding affinity of calstabin 2 for RyR2 and reduce the diastolic SR Ca2+ leak, even when the channel is PKA hyperphosphorylated. Therefore, this class of compounds has tremendous potential as novel therapeutics for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias.",

        "Abstract": "Stimulation of several G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) promotes intracellular production of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and subsequently activates protein kinase A (PKA). In the heart, beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) stimulation increases contractile performance and heart rate as part of the 'fight-or-flight' stress response. Molecular organisation of PKA-effector association occurs by A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which target kinase action to specific intracellular sites. Some AKAPs interact directly with specific cAMP-hydrolysing phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoforms allowing for the assembly of multi-protein complexes that create focal points of intracellular cAMP signalling. Certain PDE isoforms co-localise with PKA as part of negative feedback mechanisms which may protect from excess beta-AR stimulation of Ca2+ transporters during cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. Pharmacological PDE inhibition increases intracellular cAMP concentrations and augments excitation-contraction coupling in heart failure. However, chronic PDE inhibitor treatment causes severe cardiac side effects and increases mortality. Moreover, cAMP hydrolysing PDE activity was found decreased in heart failure which may contribute to disease progression via chronic PKA-dependent dysregulation of Ca2+ transport proteins. The authors review the contribution of PDE activity in the heart to contractile stress adaptation, the significance of altered cAMP signalling in heart failure, and the effects of PDE inhibition in heart disease.",

        "Abstract": "Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a form of exercise-induced sudden cardiac death that has been linked to mutations in the cardiac Ca2+ release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR2) located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We have shown that catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia-linked RyR2 mutations significantly decrease the binding affinity for calstabin-2 (FKBP12.6), a subunit that stabilizes the closed state of the channel. We have proposed that RyR2-mediated diastolic SR Ca2+ leak triggers ventricular tachycardia (VT) and sudden cardiac death. In calstabin-2-deficient mice, we have now documented diastolic SR Ca2+ leak, monophasic action potential alternans, and bidirectional VT. Calstabin-deficient cardiomyocytes exhibited SR Ca2+ leak-induced aberrant transient inward currents in diastole consistent with delayed after-depolarizations. The 1,4-benzothiazepine JTV519, which increases the binding affinity of calstabin-2 for RyR2, inhibited the diastolic SR Ca2+ leak, monophasic action potential alternans and triggered arrhythmias. Our data suggest that calstabin-2 deficiency is as a critical mediator of triggers that initiate cardiac arrhythmias.",

        "Abstract": "The ryanodine receptor (RyR)/calcium-release channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum mediates intracellular calcium release required for striated muscle contraction. RyR2, the predominant isoform in cardiac myocytes, comprises a macromolecular complex that includes calstabin2 (FKBP12.6). Calstabin2, an 11.8-kDa cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (apparent molecular mass 12.6 kDa), stabilizes the closed state of the RyR2 channel, but the mechanism by which it achieves this regulation is not fully understood. Protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of RyR2 decreases the affinity of calstabin2 for the RyR2 channel complex. In the present study we identified key aspartic acid residues on calstabin2 that are involved in binding to RyR2 and likely play a role in PKA phosphorylation-induced dissociation of calstabin2 from RyR2. We show that a mutant calstabin2 in which a key negatively charged residue (Asp-37) has been neutralized binds to a mutant RyR2 channel that mimics constitutively PKA-phosphorylated RyR2 (RyR2-S2808D). Furthermore, using wild-type and genetically altered murine models of heart failure induced by myocardial infarction, we show that manipulating the stoichiometry between calstabin2 and RyR2 can restore normal cardiac function in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Defective regulation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2)/calcium release channel, required for excitation-contraction coupling in the heart, has been linked to cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. For example, diastolic calcium \"leak\" via RyR2 channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum has been identified as an important factor contributing to impaired contractility in heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias that cause sudden cardiac death. In patients with heart failure, chronic activation of the \"fight or flight\" stress response leads to protein kinase A (PKA) hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 at Ser-2808. PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 Ser-2808 reduces the binding affinity of the channel-stabilizing subunit calstabin2, resulting in leaky RyR2 channels. We developed RyR2-S2808A mice to determine whether Ser-2808 is the functional PKA phosphorylation site on RyR2. Furthermore, mice in which the RyR2 channel cannot be PKA phosphorylated were relatively protected against the development of heart failure after myocardial infarction. Taken together, these data show that PKA phosphorylation of Ser-2808 on the RyR2 channel appears to be a critical mediator of progressive cardiac dysfunction after myocardial infarction.",

In patients, PDE inhibitors have been linked to heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias, although the mechanisms are not understood. We show that PDE4D gene inactivation in mice results in a progressive cardiomyopathy, accelerated heart failure after myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrhythmias. The phosphodiesterase 4D3 (PDE4D3) was found in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2)/calcium-release-channel complex (required for excitation-contraction [EC] coupling in heart muscle). PDE4D3 levels in the RyR2 complex were reduced in failing human hearts, contributing to PKA-hyperphosphorylated, \"leaky\" RyR2 channels that promote cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias and dysfunction associated with PDE4 inhibition or deficiency were suppressed in mice harboring RyR2 that cannot be PKA phosphorylated. These data suggest that reduced PDE4D activity causes defective RyR2-channel function associated with heart failure and arrhythmias.",

Alterations in intracellular calcium handling play a prominent role in the generation of arrhythmias in the failing heart. Diastolic calcium leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2) may initiate delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity leading to arrhythmias. Similarly, SR Ca(2+) leak through mutant RyR2 channels may cause triggered activity during exercise in patients with CPVT.

        "Title": "Enhancing calstabin binding to ryanodine receptors improves cardiac and skeletal muscle function in heart failure.",
        "Abstract": "Abnormalities in intracellular calcium release and reuptake are responsible for decreased contractility in heart failure (HF). We have previously shown that cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are protein kinase A-hyperphosphorylated and depleted of the regulatory subunit calstabin-2 in HF. Moreover, similar alterations in skeletal muscle RyR have been linked to increased fatigability in HF. To determine whether restoration of calstabin binding to RyR may ameliorate cardiac and skeletal muscle dysfunction in HF, we treated WT and calstabin-2-/- mice subjected to myocardial infarction (MI) with JTV519. JTV519, a 1,4-benzothiazepine, is a member of a class of drugs known as calcium channel stabilizers, previously shown to increase calstabin binding to RyR. Echocardiography at 21 days after MI demonstrated a significant increase in ejection fraction in WT mice treated with JTV519 (45.8 +/- 5.1%) compared with placebo (31.1 +/- 3.1%; P < 0.05). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed increased amounts of calstabin-2 bound to the RyR2 channel in JTV519-treated WT mice. However, JTV519 did not show any of these beneficial effects in calstabin-2-/- mice with MI. Additionally, JTV519 improved skeletal muscle fatigue in WT and calstabin-2-/- mice with HF by increasing the binding of calstabin-1 to RyR1. The observation that treatment with JTV519 improved cardiac function in WT but not calstabin-2-/- mice indicates that calstabin-2 binding to RyR2 is required for the beneficial effects in failing hearts. We conclude that JTV519 may provide a specific way to treat the cardiac and skeletal muscle myopathy in HF by increasing calstabin binding to RyR.",

Protein kinase A (PKA) hyperphosphorylation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) resulting in dissociation of the channel-stabilizing subunit calstabin2 (FK506-binding protein or FKBP12.6) causes SR Ca2+ leak in failing hearts and can trigger fatal ventricular arrhythmias. Little is known about the role of RyR2 dysfunction in AF, however.",

        "Abstract": "Intracellular calcium release channels are present on sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticuli (SR, ER) of all cell types. There are two classes of these channels: ryanodine receptors (RyR) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R). RyRs are required for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in striated (cardiac and skeletal) muscles. RyRs are made up of macromolecular signaling complexes that contain large cytoplasmic domains, which serve as scaffolds for proteins that regulate the function of the channel. These regulatory proteins include calstabin1/calstabin2 (FKBP12/FKBP12.6), a 12/12.6 kDa subunit that stabilizes the closed state of the channel and prevents aberrant calcium leak from the SR. Kinases and phosphatases are targeted to RyR2 channels and modulate RyR2 function in response to extracellular signals. In the classic fight or flight stress response, phosphorylation of RyR channels by protein kinase A reduces the affinity for calstabin and activates the channels leading to increased SR calcium release. In heart failure, a cardiac insult causes a mismatch between blood supply and metabolic demands of organs. The chronically activated fight or flight response leads to leaky channels, altered calcium signaling, and contractile dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmias.",

How many bright young people will be turned away from careers in biomedical research? How much innovative science will be delayed or never initiated, how many new cures never realized? At a time of unprecedented challenges and remarkable technological advances that enable us to address those challenges, lack of funding is a threat to our society.",

        "Title": "Calstabin deficiency, ryanodine receptors, and sudden cardiac death.",
        "Abstract": "Altered cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) function has an important role in heart failure and genetic forms of arrhythmias. RyR2 constitutes the major intracellular Ca2+ release channel in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) is a component of the RyR2 macromolecular signaling complex. Calstabin2 binding to RyR2 is regulated by PKA phosphorylation of Ser2809 in RyR2. PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 decreases the binding affinity for calstabin2 and increases RyR2 open probability and sensitivity to Ca2+-dependent activation. In heart failure, a majority of studies have found that RyR2 becomes chronically PKA hyper-phosphorylated which depletes calstabin2 from the channel complex. Calstabin2 dissociation causes a diastolic SR Ca2+ leak contributing to depressed intracellular Ca2+ cycling and decreased cardiac contractility. Missense mutations linked to genetic forms of exercise-induced arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death also cause decreased calstabin2-binding affinity and leaky RyR2 channels. We review the importance of calstabin2 for RyR2 function and excitation-contraction coupling, and discuss new observations that implicate dysregulation of calstabin2 binding as a central mechanism for abnormal calcium cycling in heart failure and triggered arrhythmias.",

        "Abstract": "The cardiac slow delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKs), comprised of (KCNQ1) and beta (KCNE1) subunits, is regulated by sympathetic nervous stimulation, with activation of beta-adrenergic receptors PKA phosphorylating IKs channels. We examined the effects of 2-adrenergic receptors (beta2-AR) on IKs in cardiac ventricular myocytes from transgenic mice expressing fusion proteins of IKs subunits and hbeta2-ARs. KCNQ1 and beta2-ARs were localized to the same subcellular regions, sharing intimate localization within nanometers of each other. In IKs/B2-AR myocytes, IKs density was increased, and activation shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction; IKs was not further modulated by exposure to isoproterenol, and KCNQ1 was found to be PKA-phosphorylated. Conversely, beta2-AR overexpression did not affect L-type calcium channel current (ICaL) under basal conditions with ICaL remaining responsive to cAMP. These data indicate intimate association of KCNQ1 and beta2-ARs and that beta2-AR signaling can modulate the function of IKs channels under conditions of increased beta2-AR expression, even in the absence of exogenous beta-AR agonist.",

        "Title": "Cardiac ryanodine receptor function and regulation in heart disease.",
        "Abstract": "The cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) controls intracellular Ca(2+) release and muscle contraction in the heart. Ca(2+) release via RyR2 is regulated by several physiological mediators. Protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation dissociates the stabilizing FKBP12.6 subunit (calstabin2) from the RyR2 complex, resulting in increased contractility and cardiac output. Congestive heart failure is associated with elevated plasma catecholamine levels, and chronic stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors leads to PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 in failing hearts. PKA hyperphosphorylation results in calstabin2-depleted RyR2 that displays altered channel gating and may cause aberrant SR Ca(2+) release, depletion of SR Ca(2+) stores, and reduced myocardial contractility in heart failure. Calstabin2-depleted RyR2 may also trigger cardiac arrhythmias that cause sudden cardiac death. In patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), RyR2 missense mutations cause reduced calstabin2 binding to RyR2. Increased RyR2 phosphorylation and pathologically increased calstabin2 dissociation during exercise results in aberrant diastolic calcium release, which may trigger ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. In conclusion, heart failure and exercise-induced sudden cardiac death have been linked to defects in RyR2-calstabin2 regulation, and this may represent a novel target for the prevention and treatment of these forms of heart disease.",

        "Abstract": "Heart failure remains a leading cause of mortality in the Western world. An important hallmark of heart failure is reduced myocardial contractility. Alterations in intracellular Ca2+ handling play a major role in the pathophysiology of these contractile abnormalities. Several defects in the excitation-contraction (EC) coupling system have been identified in patients with heart failure. Alterations in the density and function of proteins relevant for EC coupling have been reported. Chronic stimulation of the beta-adrenergic signaling pathway leads to protein kinase A (PKA) hyperphosphorylation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), which dissociates FKBP12.6 from RyR2, thereby altering channel gating and promoting diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release. This may deplete the SR Ca2+ stores, which may reduce myocardial contractility. Clinical studies have demonstrated that beta-adrenergic receptor blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in all grades of congestive heart failure. Our experimental data indicate that beta-blockers reverse RyR2 hyperphosphorylation and normalize channel gating, which is associated with increased contractility in heart failure. In conclusion, chronic hyperactivity of the beta-adrenergic signaling pathway impairs intracellular Ca2+ handling, which leads to reduced contractility in patients with heart failure.",

In animals with heart failure and in patients with inherited forms of exercise-induced SCD, depletion of the channel-stabilizing protein calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) from the ryanodine receptor-calcium release channel (RyR2) complex causes an intracellular Ca2+ leak that can trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias. A derivative of 1,4-benzothiazepine (JTV519) increased the affinity of calstabin2 for RyR2, which stabilized the closed state of RyR2 and prevented the Ca2+ leak that triggers arrhythmias. Thus, enhancing the binding of calstabin2 to RyR2 may be a therapeutic strategy for common ventricular arrhythmias.",

        "Abstract": "The cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2)/calcium release channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum is required for muscle excitation-contraction coupling. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified the specific Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation site on recombinant RyR2, distinct from the site for protein kinase A (PKA) that mediates the \"fight-or-flight\" stress response. CaMKII phosphorylation increased RyR2 Ca2+ sensitivity and open probability. CaMKII was activated at increased heart rates, which may contribute to enhanced Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Moreover, rate-dependent CaMKII phosphorylation of RyR2 was defective in heart failure. CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of RyR2 may contribute to the enhanced contractility observed at higher heart rates.

        "Abstract": "The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) plays an essential role in Ca2+ signaling during lymphocyte activation. Engagement of the T cell or B cell receptor by antigen initiates a signal transduction cascade that leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of IP3R by Src family nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, including Fyn. However, the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on the IP3R and subsequent Ca2+ release is poorly understood. We have identified tyrosine 353 (Tyr353) in the IP3-binding domain of type 1 IP3R (IP3R1) as a phosphorylation site for Fyn both in vitro and in vivo. We have developed a phosphoepitope-specific antibody and shown that IP3R1-Y353 becomes phosphorylated during T cell and B cell activation. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of IP3R1 increased IP3 binding at low IP3 concentrations (<10 nm). Using wild-type IP3R1 or an IP3R1-Y353F mutant that cannot be tyrosine phosphorylated at Tyr353 or expressed in IP3R-deficient DT40 B cells, we demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr353 permits prolonged intracellular Ca2+ release during B cell activation. Taken together, these data suggest that one function of tyrosine phosphorylation of IP3R1-Y353 is to enhance Ca2+ signaling in lymphocytes by increasing the sensitivity of IP3R1 to activation by low levels of IP3.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in catheter and stent design have made stent implantation the standard coronary angioplasty procedure. Unfortunately, in-stent restenosis continues to plague this procedure, with the optimum binary restenosis rates reaching ~10% to 20%. In the past few years, it has become clear that in-stent restenosis is largely due to the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells to form a neointima. To address this issue, stents coated with drug-delivery vehicles have been developed to deliver antiproliferative therapeutics. Two drugs, rapamycin and taxol, have been the lead compounds for testing the idea of a drug-eluting stent. These drugs have been successful largely because of the solid mechanistic understanding of their effects and extensive preclinical examination. The result of these years of work is that the rapamycin-coated stent entered the US market in April of 2003, and the taxol-coated stent appears poised to follow soon.",

        "Abstract": "In cardiac muscle, the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) releases the calcium required for muscle contraction. The magnitude of Ca(2+) release by RyR2, which is subject to regulation by several physiological mediators, determines cardiac contractility. In heart failure, chronic stimulation of the beta-adrenergic signaling pathway leads to hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 by protein kinase A, which dissociates calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) from the receptor. Calstabin2-depleted channels display altered channel gating and can cause diastolic Ca(2+) release from the SR. This release depletes the SR Ca(2+) stores, leading to reduced myocardial contractility. Mutant RyR2, found in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, has decreased calstabin2 binding affinity, which can trigger ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death after stress and exercise. Thus, defects in RyR2 have been linked to heart failure and exercise-induced sudden cardiac death and might provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of these common diseases of the heart.",

        "Abstract": "Excess cellular cholesterol induces apoptosis in macrophages, an event likely to promote progression of atherosclerosis. The cellular mechanism of cholesterol-induced apoptosis is unknown but had previously been thought to involve the plasma membrane. Here we report that the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum is activated in cholesterol-loaded macrophages, resulting in expression of the cell death effector CHOP. Cholesterol loading depletes endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores, an event known to induce the UPR. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum calcium depletion, the UPR, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis are markedly inhibited by selective inhibition of cholesterol trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum, and Chop-/- macrophages are protected from cholesterol-induced apoptosis. We propose that cholesterol trafficking to endoplasmic reticulum membranes, resulting in activation of the CHOP arm of the UPR, is the key signalling step in cholesterol-induced apoptosis in macrophages.",

        "Title": "Immunophilins and coupled gating of ryanodine receptors.",
        "Abstract": "The ryanodine receptor (RyR) is the major calcium (Ca(2+)) release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal and cardiac muscle and is required for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. The 565 kDa RyR protein forms a tetrameric channel that is part of a macromolecular signaling complex that also includes four FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs). The RyR channel complex is localized on specialized regions of the SR, such that the large RyR cytoplasmic domain is closely opposed to the transverse tubule (T-tubule) of the plasma membrane. RyR channel complexes are organized in regular arrays such that neighboring RyRs are in physical contact with each other. We have shown that physical and functional association between RyR1 or RyR2 channels results in coordinated gating behavior termed coupled gating. Coupled gating requires FKBP12 or FKBP12.6 in the RyR1 or RyR2 macromolecular complexes, respectively. FKBPs are known to stabilize single RyR channel function. Coupled gating describes an additional role for FKBPs in the functional coordination of RyR channel complexes that allows clusters of channels to function as \"Ca2+ release units\" (CRU). In addition, the FKBP-RyR interaction is regulated by PKA phosphorylation. In failing hearts PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 causes depletion of FKBP12.6 from the channel macromolecular complex and may contribute to contractile dysfunction by impairing EC coupling. As FKBPs are potent modulators of RyR channel function, the FKBP-RyR interaction is a focus for determining molecular mechanisms of coupled gating and presents an exciting pharmacologic target for restoration of RyR complex function in diseased states.",

        "Abstract": "Arrhythmias, a common cause of sudden cardiac death, can occur in structurally normal hearts, although the mechanism is not known. In cardiac muscle, the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum releases the calcium required for muscle contraction. The FK506 binding protein (FKBP12.6) stabilizes RyR2, preventing aberrant activation of the channel during the resting phase of the cardiac cycle. We show that during exercise, RyR2 phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) partially dissociates FKBP12.6 from the channel, increasing intracellular Ca(2+) release and cardiac contractility. FKBP12.6(-/-) mice consistently exhibited exercise-induced cardiac ventricular arrhythmias that cause sudden cardiac death. Mutations in RyR2 linked to exercise-induced arrhythmias (in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [CPVT]) reduced the affinity of FKBP12.6 for RyR2 and increased single-channel activity under conditions that simulate exercise. These data suggest that \"leaky\" RyR2 channels can trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias, providing a possible explanation for CPVT.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) blockade improves cardiac contractility and prolongs survival in patients with heart failure; however, the mechanisms underlying these favorable responses are poorly understood. Stress-induced activation of the sympathetic nervous system results in protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of the calcium (Ca2+) release channel/cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), required for cardiac excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, activating the RyR2 channel, and increasing cardiac contractility. The hyperadrenergic state of heart failure results in leaky RyR2 channels attributable to PKA hyperphosphorylation and depletion of the stabilizing FK506 binding protein, FKBP12.6. We tested the hypothesis that improved cardiac muscle function attributable to beta-AR blockade is associated with restoration of normal RyR2 channel function in patients with heart failure.",

        "Abstract": "The type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is the major calcium (Ca2+) release channel required for skeletal muscle excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. RyR1 function is modulated by proteins that bind to its large cytoplasmic scaffold domain, including the FK506 binding protein (FKBP12) and PKA. PKA is activated during sympathetic nervous system (SNS) stimulation. We show that PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 at Ser2843 activates the channel by releasing FKBP12. When FKB12 is bound to RyR1, it inhibits the channel by stabilizing its closed state. RyR1 in skeletal muscle from animals with heart failure (HF), a chronic hyperadrenergic state, were PKA hyperphosphorylated, depleted of FKBP12, and exhibited increased activity, suggesting that the channels are \"leaky.\" RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation correlated with impaired SR Ca2+ release and early fatigue in HF skeletal muscle. These findings identify a novel mechanism that regulates RyR1 function via PKA phosphorylation in response to SNS stimulation. PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 may contribute to impaired skeletal muscle function in HF, suggesting that a generalized EC coupling myopathy may play a role in HF.",

The ryanodine receptor (RyR), an intracellular Ca2+ release channel, is required for excitation-contraction coupling. The cardiac RyR has a large cytoplasmic structure that serves as a scaffold for modulatory proteins that regulate the function of the channel. Protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of RyR2 dissociates the regulatory protein FKBP 12.6 and regulates the open probability of the channel. In failing hearts, RyR2 is PKA hyperphosphorylated resulting in defective channel function due to increased sensitivity to Ca2+ induced activation.",

        "Abstract": "The cardiac ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel (RyR2) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) comprises a macromolecular complex that includes a kinase and two phosphatases that are bound to the channel via targeting proteins. We previously found that the RyR2 is protein kinase A (PKA)-hyperphosphorylated in end-stage human heart failure. Because heart failure is a progressive disease that often evolves from hypertrophy, we analyzed the RyR2 macromolecular complex in several animal models of cardiomyopathy that lead to heart failure, including hypertrophy, and at different stages of disease progression. We now show that RyR2 is PKA-hyperphosphorylated in diverse models of heart failure and that the degree of RyR2 PKA phosphorylation correlates with the degree of cardiac dysfunction. Interestingly, we show that RyR2 PKA hyperphosphorylation can be lost during perfusion of isolated hearts due to the activity of the endogenous phosphatases in the RyR2 macromolecular complex. Moreover, infusion of isoproterenol resulted in PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in rat, indicating that systemic catecholamines can activate phosphorylation of RyR2 in vivo. These studies extend our previous analyses of the RyR2 macromolecular complex, show that both the kinase and phosphatase activities in the macromolecular complex are regulated physiologically in vivo, and suggest that RyR2 PKA hyperphosphorylation is likely a general feature of heart failure.",

        "Abstract": "The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) is a ubiquitously expressed intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) release channel on the endoplasmic reticulum. IP3Rs play key roles in controlling Ca(2+) signals that activate numerous cellular functions including T cell activation, neurotransmitter release, oocyte fertilization and apoptosis. There are three forms of IP3R, all of which are ligand-gated channels activated by the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Channel function is modulated via cross-talk with other signaling pathways including those mediated by kinases and phosphatases. In particular IP3Rs are known to be regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation. In the present study we show that PKA and the protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A are components of the IP3R1 macromolecular signaling complex. PKA phosphorylation of IP3R1 increases channel activity in planar lipid bilayers. These studies indicate that regulation of IP3R1 function via PKA phosphorylation involves components of a macromolecular signaling complex.",

        "Abstract": "Defective calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling, manifest as a loss of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling gain in cardiac muscle, likely plays an important role in the pathophysiology of human heart failure. The mechanism underlying this loss of cardiac EC coupling gain involves altered regulation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), the major sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release channel in the heart. This altered regulation of RyR2 is due, in part, to hyperphosphorylation of the channel by cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 is controlled by a macromolecular signaling complex that targets PKA and two phosphatases (PP1 and PP2A) to the channel. The targeting of PKA, PP1, and PP2A to RyR2 is dependent on the binding of targeting proteins to the channel via highly conserved leucine/isoleucine zippers (LIZs). Formation of an ion channel macromolecular signaling complex is a novel role of LIZs. Recognition of this new function for LIZ motifs has provided a road map for rapidly identifying components of the RyR2 macromolecular signaling complex that play a key role in regulating normal cardiac physiology as part of the \"fight or flight\" response. The components of the RyR2 macromolecular signaling complex are also novel targets for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Dominant mutations in sarcomere protein genes cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an inherited human disorder with increased ventricular wall thickness, myocyte hypertrophy, and disarray. To understand the early consequences of mutant sarcomere proteins, we have studied mice (designated alphaMHC(403/+)) bearing an Arg403Gln missense mutation in the alpha cardiac myosin heavy chain. We demonstrate that Ca(2+) is reduced in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of alphaMHC(403/+) mice, and levels of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-binding protein calsequestrin are diminished in advance of changes in cardiac histology or morphology. Further evidence for dysregulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) in these animals is seen in their decreased expression of the ryanodine receptor Ca(2+)-release channel and its associated membrane proteins and in an increase in ryanodine receptor phosphorylation. Early administration of the L-type Ca(2+) channel inhibitor diltiazem restores normal levels of these sarcoplasmic reticular proteins and prevents the development of pathology in alphaMHC(403/+) mice. We conclude that disruption of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) homeostasis is an important early event in the pathogenesis of this disorder and suggest that the use of Ca(2+) channel blockers in advance of established clinical disease could prevent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by sarcomere protein gene mutations.",

        "Title": "Ryanodine receptors, FKBP12, and heart failure.",
        "Abstract": "RyR2 function is regulated by highly conserved signaling pathways that modulate excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation of RyR2 plays an important role in regulating channel function in response to stress signaled by the sympathetic nervous system (the classic \"fight or flight response\") (1). PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 induces dissociation of the regulatory protein FKBP12.6 resulting in channels with increased sensitivity to Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Under normal physiological conditions (no cardiac damage) PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 is part of an integrated physiological response that leads to increased EC coupling gain and increased cardiac output. PKA-hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 in failing hearts is a maladaptive response that results in depletion of FKBP12.6 from the RyR2 macromolecular complex and defective channel function (pathologically increased sensitivity to Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release) that may cause depletion of SR Ca2+ and diastolic release of SR Ca2+ that can initiate delayed after depolarizations (DADs) that trigger ventricular arrhythmias (1). RyR2 mutations in patients with catecholaminergic induced sudden cardiac death provide further evidence linking the sympathetic nervous system, RyR2 and ventricular arrhythmias (2-4). The chronic hyperadrenergic state of heart failure is associated with defective Ca2+ signaling in part due to PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2.",

        "Title": "Involvement of the cardiac ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.",
        "Abstract": "The cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), the major calcium release channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in cardiomyocytes, has recently been shown to be involved in at least two forms of sudden cardiac death (SCD): (1) Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) or familial polymorphic VT (FPVT); and (2) Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 2 (ARVD2). Eleven RyR2 missense mutations have been linked to these diseases. All eleven RyR2 mutations cluster into 3 regions of RyR2 that are homologous to the three malignant hyperthermia (MH)/central core disease (CCD) mutation regions of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel RyR1. MH/CCD RyR1 mutations have been shown to alter calcium-induced calcium release. Sympathetic nervous system stimulation leads to phosphorylation of RyR2 by protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 activates the channel. In conditions associated with high rates of SCD such as heart failure RyR2 is PKA hyperphosphorylated resulting in \"leaky\" channels. SR calcium leak during diastole can generate \"delayed after depolarizations\" that can trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., VT). We propose that RyR2 mutations linked to genetic forms of catecholaminergic-induced SCD may alter the regulation of the channel resulting in increased SR calcium leak during sympathetic stimulation.",

        "Abstract": "Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) regulation of cardiac action potential duration (APD) is mediated by beta adrenergic receptor (betaAR) activation, which increases the slow outward potassium ion current (IKS). Mutations in two human I(KS) channel subunits, hKCNQ1 and hKCNE1, prolong APD and cause inherited cardiac arrhythmias known as LQTS (long QT syndrome). We show that betaAR modulation of I(KS) requires targeting of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to hKCNQ1 through the targeting protein yotiao. Yotiao binds to hKCNQ1 by a leucine zipper motif, which is disrupted by an LQTS mutation (hKCNQ1-G589D). Identification of the hKCNQ1 macromolecular complex provides a mechanism for SNS modulation of cardiac APD through IKS.",
