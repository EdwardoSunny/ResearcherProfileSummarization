        "Abstract": "High-grade gliomas (HGG) are deadly diseases for both adult and pediatric patients. Recently, it has been shown that neuronal activity promotes progression of multiple subgroups of HGG. However, epigenetic mechanisms that govern this process remain elusive. Here we report that the chromatin remodeler CHD2 regulates neuron-glioma interactions in diffuse midline glioma (DMG) characterized by onco-histone H3.1K27M. Depletion of CHD2 in H3.1K27M DMG cells compromises cell viability and neuron-to-glioma synaptic connections in vitro, neuron-induced proliferation of H3.1K27M DMG cells in vitro and in vivo, activity-dependent calcium transients in vivo, and extends the survival of H3.1K27M DMG-bearing mice. Mechanistically, CHD2 coordinates with the transcription factor FOSL1 to control the expression of axon-guidance and synaptic genes in H3.1K27M DMG cells. Together, our study reveals a mechanism whereby CHD2 controls the intrinsic gene program of the H3.1K27M DMG subtype, which in turn regulates the tumor growth-promoting interactions of glioma cells with neurons.",

        "Abstract": "Adults and children afflicted with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) exhibit cognitive, social, and emotional impairments, and are at significantly heightened risk for schizophrenia (SCZ). The impact of this deletion on early human brain development, however, has remained unclear. Here we harness organoid models of the developing human cerebral cortex, cultivated from subjects with 22q11.2DS and SCZ, as well as unaffected control samples, to identify cell-type-specific developmental abnormalities arising from this genomic lesion. Leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing in conjunction with experimental validation, we find that the loss of genes within the 22q11.2 locus leads to a delayed development of cortical neurons. This compromised development was reflected in an elevated proportion of actively proliferating neural progenitor cells, coupled with a decreased fraction of more mature neurons. Furthermore, we identify perturbed molecular imprints linked to neuronal maturation, observe the presence of sparser neurites, and note a blunted amplitude in glutamate-induced Ca2+ transients. The aberrant transcription program underlying impaired development contains molecular signatures significantly enriched in neuropsychiatric genetic liability. MicroRNA profiling and target gene investigation suggest that microRNA dysregulation may drive perturbations of genes governing the pace at which maturation unfolds. Using protein-protein interaction network analysis we define complementary effects stemming from additional genes residing within the deleted locus. Our study uncovers reproducible neurodevelopmental and molecular alterations due to 22q11.2 deletions. These findings have the potential to facilitate disease modeling and promote the pursuit of therapeutic interventions.",

However, their efficacy in recapitulating brain network properties that encode brain function remains limited, thereby precluding development of effective in vitro models of complex brain disorders like schizophrenia. Here, we develop and characterize a Modular Neuronal Network (MoNNet) approach that recapitulates specific features of neuronal ensemble dynamics, segregated local-global network activities and a hierarchical modular organization. We utilized MoNNets for quantitative in vitro modelling of schizophrenia-related network dysfunctions caused by highly penetrant mutations in SETD1A and 22q11.2 risk loci. Furthermore, we demonstrate its utility for drug discovery by performing pharmacological rescue of alterations in neuronal ensembles stability and global network synchrony. MoNNets allow in vitro modelling of brain diseases for investigating the underlying neuronal network mechanisms and systematic drug discovery.",

        "Abstract": "Cortical interneurons establish inhibitory microcircuits throughout the neocortex and their dysfunction has been implicated in epilepsy and neuropsychiatric diseases. Developmentally, interneurons migrate from a distal progenitor domain in order to populate the neocortex - a process that occurs at a slower rate in humans than in mice. In this study, we sought to identify factors that regulate the rate of interneuron maturation across the two species. Using embryonic mouse development as a model system, we found that the process of initiating interneuron migration is regulated by blood vessels of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), an interneuron progenitor domain. We identified two endothelial cell-derived paracrine factors, SPARC and SerpinE1, that enhance interneuron migration in mouse MGE explants and organotypic cultures. Moreover, pre-treatment of human stem cell-derived interneurons (hSC-interneurons) with SPARC and SerpinE1 prior to transplantation into neonatal mouse cortex enhanced their migration and morphological elaboration in the host cortex. Further, SPARC and SerpinE1-treated hSC-interneurons also exhibited more mature electrophysiological characteristics compared to controls. Overall, our studies suggest a critical role for CNS vasculature in regulating interneuron developmental maturation in both mice and humans.",

        "Abstract": "SETD1A, a lysine-methyltransferase, is a key schizophrenia susceptibility gene. Mice carrying a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of the orthologous gene exhibit alterations in axonal branching and cortical synaptic dynamics accompanied by working memory deficits. We show that Setd1a binds both promoters and enhancers with a striking overlap between Setd1a and Mef2 on enhancers. Setd1a targets\u00a0are highly expressed in pyramidal neurons and display a complex pattern of transcriptional up- and downregulations shaped by presumed opposing functions of Setd1a on promoters and Mef2-bound enhancers. Notably, evolutionarily conserved Setd1a targets are associated with neuropsychiatric genetic risk burden. Reinstating Setd1a expression in adulthood rescues cognitive deficits. Finally, we identify LSD1 as a major counteracting demethylase for Setd1a and show that its pharmacological antagonism results in a full rescue of the behavioral and morphological deficits in Setd1a-deficient mice. Our findings advance understanding of how SETD1A mutations predispose to schizophrenia (SCZ) and point to novel therapeutic interventions.",

        "Abstract": "Studies using powerful family-based designs aided by large scale case-control studies, have been instrumental in cracking the genetic complexity of the disease, identifying rare and highly penetrant risk mutations and providing a handle on experimentally tractable model systems. Mouse models of rare mutations, paired with analysis of homologous cognitive and sensory processing deficits and state-of-the-art neuroscience methods to manipulate and record neuronal activity have started providing unprecedented insights into pathogenic mechanisms and building the foundation of a new biological framework for understanding mental illness. A number of important principles are emerging, namely that degradation of the computational mechanisms underlying the ordered activity and plasticity of both local and long-range neuronal assemblies, the building blocks necessary for stable cognition and perception, might be the inevitable consequence and the common point of convergence of the vastly heterogeneous genetic liability, manifesting as defective internally- or stimulus-driven neuronal activation patterns and triggering the constellation of schizophrenia symptoms. Animal models of rare mutations have the unique potential to help us move from \"which\" (gene) to \"how\", \"where\" and \"when\" computational regimes of neural ensembles are affected. Linking these variables should improve our understanding of how symptoms emerge and how diagnostic boundaries are established at a circuit level. Eventually, a better understanding of pathophysiological trajectories at the level of neural circuitry in mice, aided by basic human experimental biology, should guide the development of new therapeutics targeting either altered circuitry itself or the underlying biological pathways.",

        "Abstract": "During the past two decades, the number of animal models of psychiatric disorders has grown exponentially. Of these, genetic animal models that are modeled after rare but highly penetrant mutations hold great promise for deciphering critical molecular, synaptic, and neurocircuitry deficits of major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. Animal models should aim to focus on core aspects rather than capture the entire human disease. In this context, animal models with strong etiological validity, where behavioral and neurophysiological phenotypes and the features of the disease being modeled are in unambiguous homology, are being used to dissect both elementary and complex cognitive and perceptual processing deficits present in psychiatric disorders at the level of neurocircuitry, shedding new light on critical disease mechanisms. Recent progress in neuroscience along with large-scale initiatives that propose a consistent approach in characterizing these deficits across different laboratories will further enhance the efficacy of these studies that will ultimately lead to identifying new biological targets for drug development.",

        "Abstract": "The potential role in neuropsychiatric disease risk arising from alterations and derangements of endogenous small-molecule metabolites remains understudied. Alterations of endogenous metabolite concentrations can arise in multiple ways. Marked derangements of single endogenous small-molecule metabolites are found in a large group of rare genetic human diseases termed \"inborn errors of metabolism\", many of which are associated with prominent neuropsychiatric symptomology. Whether such metabolites act neuroactively to directly lead to distinct neural dysfunction has been frequently hypothesized but rarely demonstrated unequivocally. Here we discuss this disease concept in the context of our recent findings demonstrating that neural dysfunction arising from accumulation of the schizophrenia-associated metabolite l-proline is due to its structural mimicry of the neurotransmitter GABA that leads to alterations in GABA-ergic short-term synaptic plasticity. For cases in which a similar direct action upon neurotransmitter binding sites is suspected, we lay out a systematic approach that can be extended to assessing the potential disruptive action of such candidate disease metabolites. To address the potentially important and broader role in neuropsychiatric disease, we also consider whether the more subtle yet more ubiquitous variations in endogenous metabolites arising from natural allelic variation may likewise contribute to disease risk but in a more complex and nuanced manner.",

        "Abstract": "Cross-frequency coupling supports the organization of brain rhythms and is present during a range of cognitive functions. However, little is known about whether and how long-range cross-frequency coupling across distant brain regions subserves working memory. Here we report that theta-slow gamma coupling between the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is augmented in a genetic mouse model of cognitive dysfunction. This increased cross-frequency coupling is observed specifically when the mice successfully perform a spatial working memory task. In wild-type mice, increasing task difficulty by introducing a long delay or by optogenetically interfering with encoding, also increases theta-gamma coupling during correct trials. Finally, epochs of high hippocampal theta-prefrontal slow gamma coupling are associated with increased synchronization of neurons within the mPFC. These findings suggest that enhancement of theta-slow gamma coupling reflects a compensatory mechanism to maintain spatial working memory performance in the setting of increased difficulty.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical trials of bone marrow cell-based therapies after acute myocardial infarction (MI) have produced mostly neutral results. Treatment with specific bone marrow cell-derived secreted proteins may provide an alternative biological approach to improving tissue repair and heart function after MI. We recently performed a bioinformatic secretome analysis in bone marrow cells from patients with acute MI and discovered a poorly characterized secreted protein, EMC10 (endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex subunit 10), showing activity in an angiogenic screen.",

        "Abstract": "Altered prefrontal cortex function is implicated in schizophrenia (SCZ) pathophysiology and could arise from imbalance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) in local circuits. It remains unclear whether and how such imbalances relate to genetic etiologies. We used a mouse model of the SCZ-predisposing 22q11.2 deletion (Df(16)A+/- mice) to evaluate how this genetic lesion affects the excitability of layer V prefrontal pyramidal neurons and its modulation by dopamine (DA). Df(16)A+/- mice have normal balance between E/I at baseline but are unable to maintain it upon dopaminergic challenge. Specifically, in wild-type mice, D1 receptor (D1R) activation enhances excitability of layer V prefrontal pyramidal neurons and D2 receptor (D2R) activation reduces it. Whereas the excitatory effect upon D1R activation is enhanced in Df(16)A+/- mice, the inhibitory effect upon D2R activation is reduced. The latter is partly due to the inability of mutant mice to activate GABAergic parvalbumin (PV)+ interneurons through D2Rs. We further demonstrate that reduced KCNQ2 channel function in PV+ interneurons in Df(16)A+/- mice renders them less capable of inhibiting pyramidal neurons upon D2 modulation. Thus, DA modulation of PV+ interneurons and control of E/I are altered in Df(16)A+/- mice with a higher excitation and lower inhibition during dopaminergic modulation.",

        "Abstract": "Proline dehydrogenase (PRODH), which degrades L-proline, resides within the schizophrenia-linked 22q11.2 deletion suggesting a role in disease. Supporting this, elevated L-proline levels have been shown to increase risk for psychotic disorders. Despite the strength of data linking PRODH and L-proline to neuropsychiatric diseases, targets of disease-relevant concentrations of L-proline have not been convincingly described. Here, we show that Prodh-deficient mice with elevated CNS L-proline display specific deficits in high-frequency GABA-ergic transmission and gamma-band oscillations. We find that L-proline is a GABA-mimetic and can act at multiple GABA-ergic targets. However, at disease-relevant concentrations, GABA-mimesis is limited to competitive blockade of glutamate decarboxylase leading to reduced GABA production. Significantly, deficits in GABA-ergic transmission are reversed by enhancing net GABA production with the clinically relevant compound vigabatrin. These findings indicate that accumulation of a neuroactive metabolite can lead to molecular and synaptic dysfunction and help to understand mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disease.",

        "Abstract": "Cognitive deficits represent a major burden of neuropsychiatric disorders and result in part from abnormal communication within hippocampal-prefrontal circuits. While it has been hypothesized that this network dysfunction arises during development, long before the first clinical symptoms, experimental evidence is still missing. Here, we show that pre-juvenile mice mimicking genetic and environmental risk factors of disease (dual-hit GE mice) have poorer recognition memory that correlates with augmented coupling by synchrony and stronger directed interactions between prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The network dysfunction emerges already during neonatal development, yet it initially consists in a diminished hippocampal theta drive and consequently, a weaker and disorganized entrainment of local prefrontal circuits in discontinuous oscillatory activity in dual-hit GE mice when compared with controls. Thus, impaired maturation of functional communication within hippocampal-prefrontal networks switching from hypo- to hyper-coupling may represent a mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of cognitive deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Reduced expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, which results in deficient activity-dependent secretion of BDNF, is associated with clinical features of schizophrenia. We investigated the effect of this polymorphism on Prepulse Inhibition (PPI), a translational model of sensorimotor gating which is disrupted in schizophrenia. We utilized humanized BDNFVal66Met (hBDNFVal66Met) mice which have been modified to carry the Val66Met polymorphism, as well as express humanized BDNF in vivo. We also studied the long-term effect of chronic corticosterone (CORT) exposure in these animals as a model of history of stress. PPI was assessed at 30ms and 100ms interstimulus intervals (ISI). Analysis of PPI at the commonly used 100ms ISI identified that, irrespective of CORT treatment, the hBDNFVal/Met genotype was associated with significantly reduced PPI. In contrast, PPI was not different between hBDNFMet/Met and hBDNFVal/Val genotype mice. At the 30ms ISI, CORT treatment selectively disrupted sensorimotor gating of hBDNFVal/Met heterozygote mice but not hBDNFVal/Val or hBDNFMet/Met mice. Analysis of startle reactivity revealed that chronic CORT reduced startle reactivity of hBDNFVal/Val male mice by 51%. However, this was independent of the effect of CORT on PPI. In summary, we provide evidence of a distinct BDNFVal66Met heterozygote-specific phenotype using the sensorimotor gating endophenotype of schizophrenia. These data have important implications for clinical studies where, if possible, the BDNFVal/Met heterozygote genotype should be distinguished from the BDNFMet/Met genotype.",

        "Abstract": "We analyze de novo synonymous mutations identified in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia (SCZ) with potential impact on regulatory elements using data from whole-exome sequencing (WESs) studies. Focusing on five types of genetic regulatory functions, we found that de novo near-splice site synonymous mutations changing exonic splicing regulators and those within frontal cortex-derived DNase I hypersensitivity sites are significantly enriched in ASD and SCZ, respectively. These results remained significant, albeit less so, after incorporating two additional ASD datasets. Among the genes identified, several are hit by multiple functional de novo mutations, with RAB2A and SETD1A showing the highest statistical significance in ASD and SCZ, respectively. The estimated contribution of these synonymous mutations to disease liability is comparable to de novo protein-truncating mutations. These findings expand the repertoire of functional de novo mutations to include \"functional\" synonymous ones and strengthen the role of rare variants in neuropsychiatric disease risk.",

        "Abstract": "While the genetic basis of schizophrenia is increasingly well characterized, novel treatments will require establishing mechanistic relationships between specific risk genes and core phenotypes. Rare, highly penetrant risk genes such as the 22q11.2 microdeletion are promising in this regard. Df(16)A(+/-) mice, which carry a homologous microdeletion, have deficits in hippocampal-prefrontal connectivity that correlate with deficits in spatial working memory. These mice also have deficits in axonal development that are accompanied by dysregulated Gsk3\u03b2 signaling and can be rescued by Gsk3 antagonists. Here we show that developmental inhibition of Gsk3 rescues deficits in hippocampal-prefrontal connectivity, task-related neural activity, and spatial working memory behavior in Df(16)A(+/-) mice. Taken together, these results provide mechanistic insight into how the microdeletion results in cognitive deficits, and they suggest possible targets for novel therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Several neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with cognitive and social dysfunction. Postmortem studies of patients with schizophrenia have revealed specific changes in area CA2, a long-overlooked region of the hippocampus recently found to be critical for social memory formation. To examine how area CA2 is altered in psychiatric illness, we used the Df(16)A(+/-) mouse model of the 22q11.2 microdeletion, a genetic risk factor for developing several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. We report several age-dependent CA2 alterations: a decrease in the density of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, a reduction in the amount of feedforward inhibition, and a change in CA2 pyramidal-neuron intrinsic properties. Furthermore, we found that area CA2 is less plastic in Df(16)A(+/-) mice, making it nearly impossible to evoke action potential firing in CA2 pyramidal neurons. Finally, we show that Df(16)A(+/-) mice display impaired social cognition, providing a potential mechanism and a neural substrate for this impairment in psychiatric disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Processing of microRNA primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs)\u00a0is highly regulated and defects in the processing machinery play a key role in many human diseases. In 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), heterozygous deletion of DiGeorge critical region gene 8 (DGCR8) causes a processing deficiency, which contributes to abnormal brain development. The DGCR8 protein is the RNA-binding partner of Drosha RNase, both essential for processing canonical pri-miRNAs. To identify an agent that can compensate reduced DGCR8 expression, we screened for metalloporphyrins that can mimic the natural DGCR8 heme cofactor. We found that Co(III) protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) stably binds DGCR8 and activates it for pri-miRNA processing in\u00a0vitro and in HeLa cells. Importantly, treating cultured Dgcr8(+/-) mouse neurons with Co(III)PPIX can compensate the pri-miRNA processing defects. Co(III)PPIX is effective at concentrations as low as 0.2\u00a0\u03bcM and is not degraded by heme degradation enzymes, making it useful as a research tool and a potential therapeutic.",

        "Abstract": "Spatial working memory, the caching of behaviourally relevant spatial cues on a timescale of seconds, is a fundamental constituent of cognition. Although the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are known to contribute jointly to successful spatial working memory, the anatomical pathway and temporal window for the interaction of these structures critical to spatial working memory has not yet been established. Here we find that direct hippocampal-prefrontal afferents are critical for encoding, but not for maintenance or retrieval, of spatial cues in mice. These cues are represented by the activity of individual prefrontal units in a manner that is dependent on hippocampal input only during the cue-encoding phase of a spatial working memory task. Successful encoding of these cues appears to be mediated by gamma-frequency synchrony between the two structures. These findings indicate a critical role for the direct hippocampal-prefrontal afferent pathway in the continuous updating of task-related spatial information during spatial working memory.",

        "Abstract": "22q11.2 deletion carriers show specific cognitive deficits, and \u223c30% of them develop schizophrenia. One of the disrupted genes is ZDHHC8, which encodes for a palmitoyltransferase. We show that Zdhhc8-deficient mice have reduced palmitoylation of proteins that regulate axonal growth and branching. Analysis of axonal projections of pyramidal neurons from both Zdhhc8-deficient and Df(16)A(+/-) mice, which model the 22q11.2 deletion, revealed deficits in axonal growth and terminal arborization, which can be prevented by reintroduction of active ZDHHC8 protein. Impaired terminal arborization is accompanied by a reduction in the strength of synaptic connections and altered functional connectivity and working memory. The effect of ZDHHC8 is mediated in part via Cdc42-dependent modulation of Akt/Gsk3\u03b2 signaling at the tip of the axon and can be reversed by pharmacologically decreasing Gsk3\u03b2 activity during postnatal brain development. Our findings provide valuable mechanistic insights into the cognitive and psychiatric symptoms associated with a schizophrenia-predisposing mutation.",

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) account for a substantial portion of the total detected genetic variation in gene expression but how exactly variants acting in trans modulate gene expression and disease susceptibility remains largely unknown. The BDNF Val66Met SNP has been associated with a number of psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and related traits. Using global microRNA expression profiling in hippocampus of humanized BDNF Val66Met knock-in mice we showed that this variant results in dysregulation of at least one microRNA, which in turn affects downstream target genes. Specifically, we show that reduced levels of miR-146b (mir146b), lead to increased Per1 and Npas4 mRNA levels and increased Irak1 protein levels in vitro and are associated with similar changes in the hippocampus of hBDNF(Met/Met) mice. Our findings highlight trans effects of common variants on microRNA-mediated gene expression as an integral part of the genetic architecture of complex disorders and traits.",

        "Abstract": "Synaptic plasticity alters the strength of information flow between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons and thus modifies the likelihood that action potentials in a presynaptic neuron will lead to an action potential in a postsynaptic neuron. As such, synaptic plasticity and pathological changes in synaptic plasticity impact the synaptic computation which controls the information flow through the neural microcircuits responsible for the complex information processing necessary to drive adaptive behaviors. As current theories of neuropsychiatric disease suggest that distinct dysfunctions in neural circuit performance may critically underlie the unique symptoms of these diseases, pathological alterations in synaptic plasticity mechanisms may be fundamental to the disease process. Here we consider mechanisms of both short-term and long-term plasticity of synaptic transmission and their possible roles in information processing by neural microcircuits in both health and disease. As paradigms of neuropsychiatric diseases with strongly implicated risk genes, we discuss the findings in schizophrenia and autism and consider the alterations in synaptic plasticity and network function observed in both human studies and genetic mouse models of these diseases. Together these studies have begun to point toward a likely dominant role of short-term synaptic plasticity alterations in schizophrenia while dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) may be due to a combination of both short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity alterations.",

        "Abstract": "Disrupted in schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) gene is associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders as it is disrupted by a balanced translocation involving chromosomes 1 and 11 in a large Scottish pedigree with high prevalence of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. Since its identification, several mouse models with DISC1 genetic modifications have been generated using different approaches. Interestingly, a natural deletion of 25bp in the 129 mouse strain alters the DISC1 gene reading frame leading to a premature stop codon very close to the gene breakpoint in the mutant allele of the Scottish family. In the present study we confirmed that the 129DISC1(Del) mutation results in reduced level of full length DISC1 in hippocampus of heterozygous mice and we have characterized the behavioral consequences of heterozygous 129DISC1(Del) mutation in a mixed B6129 genetic background. We found alterations in spontaneous locomotor activity (hyperactivity in males and hypoactivity in females), deficits in pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) and also increased despair behavior in heterozygous 129DISC1(Del) mice, thus reproducing typical behaviors associated to psychiatric disorders. Since this mouse strain is widely and commercially available, we propose it as an amenable tool to study DISC1-related biochemical alterations and psychiatric behaviors.",

Here, we perform a systematic investigation of the role of both de novo and inherited LOF variants in schizophrenia using exome sequencing data from 231 case and 34 control trios. We identify two de novo LOF variants in the SETD1A gene, which encodes a subunit of histone methyltransferase, a finding unlikely to have occurred by chance, and provide evidence for a more general role of chromatin regulators in schizophrenia risk. Transmission pattern analyses reveal that LOF variants are more likely to be transmitted to affected individuals than controls. This is especially true for private LOF variants in genes intolerant to functional genetic variation. These findings highlight the contribution of LOF mutations to the genetic architecture of schizophrenia and provide important insights into disease pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "We used a family-based cluster detection approach designed to localize significant rare disease-risk variants clusters within a region of interest to systematically search for schizophrenia (SCZ) susceptibility genes within 49 genomic loci previously implicated by de novo copy number variants. Using two independent whole-exome sequencing family datasets and a follow-up autism spectrum disorder (ASD) case/control whole-exome sequencing dataset, we identified variants in one gene, Fanconi-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1), as being associated with both SCZ and ASD. FAN1 is located in a region on chromosome 15q13.3 implicated by a recurrent copy number variant, which predisposes to an array of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental phenotypes. In both SCZ and ASD datasets, rare nonsynonymous risk variants cluster significantly in affected individuals within a 20-kb window that spans several key functional domains of the gene. Our finding suggests that FAN1 is a key driver in the 15q13.3 locus for the associated psychiatric and neurodevelopmental phenotypes. FAN1 encodes a DNA repair enzyme, thus implicating abnormalities in DNA repair in the susceptibility to SCZ or ASD.",

        "Abstract": "We previously reported linkage of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder to 13q32-34 in the European descent Afrikaner population from South Africa. The nature of genetic variation underlying linkage peaks in psychiatric disorders remains largely unknown and both rare and common variants may be contributing. Here, we examine the contribution of common variants located under the 13q32-34 linkage region. We used densely spaced SNPs to fine map the linkage peak region using both a discovery sample of 415 families and a meta-analysis incorporating two additional replication family samples. In a second phase of the study, we use one family-based data set with 237 families and independent case-control data sets for fine mapping of the common variant association signal using HapMap SNPs. We report a significant association with a genetic variant (rs9583277) within the gene encoding for the myosin heavy-chain Myr 8 (MYO16), which has been implicated in neuronal phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling. Follow-up analysis of HapMap variation within MYO16 in a second set of Afrikaner families and additional case-control data sets of European descent highlighted a region across introns 2-6 as the most likely region to harbor common MYO16 risk variants. Expression analysis revealed a significant increase in the level of MYO16 expression in the brains of schizophrenia patients. Our results suggest that common variation within MYO16 may contribute to the genetic liability to schizophrenia.",

        "Abstract": "We used a mouse model of the schizophrenia-predisposing 22q11.2 microdeletion to evaluate how this genetic lesion affects cortical neural circuits at the synaptic, cellular, and molecular levels. Guided by cognitive deficits, we demonstrated that mutant mice display robust deficits in high-frequency synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity (synaptic depression and potentiation), as well as alterations in long-term plasticity and dendritic spine stability. Apart from previously reported reduction in dendritic complexity of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, altered synaptic plasticity occurs in the context of relatively circumscribed and often subtle cytoarchitectural changes in neuronal density and inhibitory neuron numbers. We confirmed the pronounced DiGeorge critical region 8 (Dgcr8)-dependent deficits in primary micro-RNA processing and identified additional changes in gene expression and RNA splicing that may underlie the effects of this mutation. Reduction in Dgcr8 levels appears to be a major driver of altered short-term synaptic plasticity in prefrontal cortex and working memory but not of long-term plasticity and cytoarchitecture. Our findings inform the cortical synaptic and neuronal mechanisms of working memory impairment in the context of psychiatric disorders. They also provide insight into the link between micro-RNA dysregulation and genetic liability to schizophrenia and cognitive dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "22q11.2 microdeletions result in specific cognitive deficits and schizophrenia. Analysis of Df(16)A(+/-) mice, which model this microdeletion, revealed abnormalities in the formation of neuronal dendrites and spines, as well as altered brain microRNAs. Here, we show a drastic reduction of miR-185, which resides within the 22q11.2 locus, to levels more than expected by a hemizygous deletion, and we demonstrate that this reduction alters dendritic and spine development. miR-185 represses, through an evolutionarily conserved target site, a previously unknown inhibitor of these processes that resides in the Golgi apparatus and shows higher prenatal brain expression. Sustained derepression of this inhibitor after birth represents the most robust transcriptional disturbance in the brains of Df(16)A(+/-) mice and results in structural alterations in the hippocampus. Reduction of miR-185 also has milder age- and region-specific effects on the expression of some Golgi-related genes. Our findings illuminate the contribution of microRNAs in psychiatric disorders and cognitive dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the successful identification of several relevant genomic loci, the underlying molecular mechanisms of schizophrenia remain largely unclear. We developed a computational approach (NETBAG+) that allows an integrated analysis of diverse disease-related genetic data using a unified statistical framework. The application of this approach to schizophrenia-associated genetic variations, obtained using unbiased whole-genome methods, allowed us to identify several cohesive gene networks related to axon guidance, neuronal cell mobility, synaptic function and chromosomal remodeling. The genes forming the networks are highly expressed in the brain, with higher brain expression during prenatal development. The identified networks are functionally related to genes previously implicated in schizophrenia, autism and intellectual disability. A comparative analysis of copy number variants associated with autism and schizophrenia suggests that although the molecular networks implicated in these distinct disorders may be related, the mutations associated with each disease are likely to lead, at least on average, to different functional consequences.",

        "Abstract": "To evaluate evidence for de novo etiologies in schizophrenia, we sequenced at high coverage the exomes of families recruited from two populations with distinct demographic structures and history. We sequenced a total of 795 exomes from 231 parent-proband trios enriched for sporadic schizophrenia cases, as well as 34 unaffected trios. We observed in cases an excess of de novo nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants as well as a higher prevalence of gene-disruptive de novo mutations relative to controls. We found four genes (LAMA2, DPYD, TRRAP and VPS39) affected by recurrent de novo events within or across the two populations, which is unlikely to have occurred by chance. We show that de novo mutations affect genes with diverse functions and developmental profiles, but we also find a substantial contribution of mutations in genes with higher expression in early fetal life. Our results help define the genomic and neural architecture of schizophrenia.",

        "Abstract": "The enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is part of the metabolic pathway of 17\u03b2-estradiol, converting 2-hydroxyestradiol to 2-methoxyestradiol. We recently showed that administration of the COMT product 2-methoxyestradiol has anti-inflammatory and anti-osteoporotic effects. We have now investigated whether COMT affects the immune system, by immunologically phenotyping COMT deficient (COMT(-/-)) mice. Immunoglobulin production, T lymphocyte proliferation, NK cell cytotoxicity and oxygen radical production were assessed. In male COMT(-/-)-mice, the total number of T-, and B-lymphocytes from spleen increased but the T-cell proliferative response decreased. The NK cell population shifted toward less mature cells, leaving cytotoxic capacity unaffected. In COMT(-/-)-females, a higher frequency of neutrophils was found but the oxygen radical production was unaltered. In conclusion, only minor changes of the immune system were seen in COMT deficient mice, and the changes were usually seen in males. This study provides clues into how COMT activity, and hence gender differences, affects the immune system.",

        "Abstract": "Cannabis use confers a two-fold increase in risk for psychosis, with adolescent use conferring an even greater risk. A high-low activity polymorphism in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), a gene encoding the COMT enzyme involved in dopamine clearance in the brain, may interact with adolescent cannabis exposure to increase risk for schizophrenia. The impact of such an interaction on central neurotransmitter pathways implicated in schizophrenia is unknown. Male mice with knockout of the COMT gene were treated chronically with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during adolescence (postnatal day 32-52). We measured the size and density of GABAergic cells and the protein expression of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) in knockout mice relative to heterozygous mutants and wild-type controls. Size and density of dopaminergic neurons was also assessed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) across the genotypes. COMT genotype \u00d7 THC treatment interactions were observed for: (1) dopaminergic cell size in the VTA, (2) CB1R protein expression in the HPC, and (3) parvalbumin (PV) cell size in the PFC. No effects of adolescent THC treatment were observed for PV and dopaminergic cell density across the COMT genotypes. COMT genotype modulates the effects of chronic THC administration during adolescence on indices of neurotransmitter function in the brain. These findings illuminate how COMT deletion and adolescent cannabis use can interact to modulate the function of neurotransmitters systems implicated in schizophrenia.",

        "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNA), a class of non-coding RNAs, are emerging as important modulators of neuronal development, structure and function. A connection has been established between abnormalities in miRNA expression and miRNA-mediated gene regulation and psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders as well as cognitive dysfunction. Establishment of this connection has been driven by progress in elucidating the genetic etiology of these phenotypes and has provided a context to interpret additional supporting evidence accumulating from parallel expression profiling studies in brains and peripheral blood of patients. Here we review relevant evidence that supports this connection and explore possible mechanisms that underlie the contribution of individual miRNAs and miRNA-related pathways to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of these complex clinical phenotypes. The existing evidence provides useful hypotheses for further investigation as well as important clues for identifying novel therapeutic targets.",

A number of recent studies, building upon earlier findings of copy number variants (CNVs) at the 22q11.2 locus, suggest that rare CNVs represent an important component of genetic heterogeneity in the etiology of complex psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia. De novo CNVs are found with higher frequency among sporadic cases, whereas inherited CNVs are enriched among familial cases. Despite substantial progress, a number of challenges remain, such as pinpointing causative relationships between specific gene(s) affected by CNVs and disease phenotypes as well as distinguishing abnormal structural mutations from neutral polymorphisms and establishing a clear association between individual pathogenic CNV and disease phenotypes.",

        "Abstract": "Catechol-O-methyltransferase, an enzyme involved in regulating brain catecholamine levels, has been implicated in anxiety, pain and/or stress responsivity. Elements of this putative association remain unclarified, notably whether: (a) COMT variation modulates responses to acute and/or chronic stress equally; (b) acute pharmacological inhibition of COMT produces comparable effects on anxiety to that observed after deletion of the COMT gene; (c) COMT genotype modulates action of anxiolytic drugs. We aimed to further investigate the relationship between reduced COMT function, anxiety and stress responsivity in mice. To compare the effect of acute vs. chronic restraint stress in female COMT KO vs. WT mice, serum corticosterone and cytokine concentrations were measured [Experiment 1]. Sensitivity to the benzodiazepines midazolam and chlordiazepoxide in the light-dark test was assessed in female COMT KO vs. WT mice [Experiment 2]. Effects of acute administration of the COMT inhibitor tolcapone, and of these same benzodiazepines thereon, in the light-dark test were assessed in female C57BL/6 mice [Experiment 3]. COMT KO mice demonstrated an increased corticosterone response to acute but not chronic stress, and a modified cytokine profile after chronic, but not acute stress. COMT KO mice showed increased anxiety, but benzodiazepine sensitivity was affected by COMT genotype. Whilst tolcapone had no effect on light/dark performance in C57BL6/J mice it decreased benzodiazepine sensitivity. These data elaborate earlier findings of increased anxiety in female COMT KO mice and also clarify a role for COMT in modulating stress-related hormonal and immune parameters in a manner that depends on chronicity of the stressor.",

Moreover, it is uncertain at what level, besides gross behavior, mental illnesses can be differentiated. To advance our understanding of psychiatric disease, we advocate a more systematic approach in characterizing a small number of animal models by utilizing unequivocal rare disease mutations and targeted cognitive assessment to identify convergent disease circuits and mechanisms. Based on available data, we discuss the possibility that the temporal dynamics of synaptic plasticity play a central role in disease pathophysiology and that the extent and manner in which they are altered in specific neural circuits determine the exact clinical phenotype of diverse disorders.",

        "Title": "Genetic vs. pharmacological inactivation of COMT influences cannabinoid-induced expression of schizophrenia-related phenotypes.",
        "Abstract": "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is an important enzyme in the metabolism of dopamine and disturbance in dopamine function is proposed to be central to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Clinical epidemiological studies have indicated cannabis use to confer a 2-fold increase in risk for subsequent onset of psychosis, with adolescent-onset use conveying even higher risk. There is evidence that a high activity COMT polymorphism moderates the effects of adolescent exposure to cannabis on risk for adult psychosis. In this paper we compared the effect of chronic adolescent exposure to the cannabinoid WIN 55212 on sensorimotor gating, behaviours related to the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, anxiety- and stress-related behaviours, as well as ex-vivo brain dopamine and serotonin levels, in COMT KO vs. wild-type (WT) mice. Additionally, we examined the effect of pretreatment with the COMT inhibitor tolcapone on acute effects of this cannabinoid on sensorimotor gating in C57BL/6 mice. COMT KO mice were shown to be more vulnerable than WT to the disruptive effects of adolescent cannabinoid treatment on prepulse inhibition (PPI). Acute pharmacological inhibition of COMT in C57BL/6 mice also modified acute cannabinoid effects on startle reactivity, as well as PPI, indicating that chronic and acute loss of COMT can produce dissociable effects on the behavioural effects of cannabinoids. COMT KO mice also demonstrated differential effects of adolescent cannabinoid administration on sociability and anxiety-related behaviour, both confirming and extending earlier reports of COMT\u00d7cannabinoid effects on the expression of schizophrenia-related endophenotypes.",

Here, we study a mouse strain with a truncating lesion in the endogenous Disc1 ortholog designed to model the effects of a schizophrenia-predisposing mutation and offer a detailed account of the consequences that this mutation has on the development and function of a hippocampal circuit. We uncover widespread and cumulative cytoarchitectural alterations in the dentate gyrus during neonatal and adult neurogenesis, which include errors in axonal targeting and are accompanied by changes in short-term plasticity at the mossy fiber/CA3 circuit. We also provide evidence that cAMP levels are elevated as a result of the Disc1 mutation, leading to altered axonal targeting and dendritic growth. The identified structural alterations are, for the most part, not consistent with the growth-promoting and premature maturation effects inferred from previous RNAi-based Disc1 knockdown. Our results provide support to the notion that modest disturbances of neuronal connectivity and accompanying deficits in short-term synaptic dynamics is a general feature of schizophrenia-predisposing mutations.",

        "Abstract": "Although a genetic component of schizophrenia has been acknowledged for a long time, the underlying architecture of the genetic risk remains a contentious issue. Early linkage and candidate association studies led to largely inconclusive results. More recently, the availability of powerful technologies, samples of sufficient sizes, and genome-wide panels of genetic markers facilitated systematic and agnostic scans throughout the genome for either common or rare disease risk variants of small or large effect size, respectively. Although the former had limited success, the role of rare genetic events, such as copy-number variants (CNVs) or rare point mutations, has become increasingly important in gene discovery for schizophrenia. Importantly, recent research building upon earlier findings of de novo recurrent CNVs at the 22q11.2 locus, has highlighted a de novo mutational paradigm as a major component of the genetic architecture of schizophrenia. Recent progress is bringing us closer to earlier intervention and new therapeutic targets.",

        "Abstract": "Estradiol is converted to the biologically active metabolite 2-methoxyestradiol via the activity of the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Exogenous administration of both estradiol and 2-methoxyestradiol reduces experimental atherosclerosis and neointima formation, and COMT-dependent formation of 2-methoxyestradiol likely mediates the antimitogenic effect of estradiol on smooth muscle cells in vitro. This study evaluated whether 2-methoxyestradiol mediates the vasculoprotective actions of estradiol in vivo. Wild-type (WT) and COMT knockout (COMTKO) mice on an apolipoprotein E-deficient background were gonadectomized and treated with estradiol or placebo. Exogenous estradiol reduced atherosclerotic lesion formation in both females (WT, -78%; COMTKO, -82%) and males (WT, -48%; COMTKO, -53%) and was equally effective in both genotypes. We further evaluated how exogenous estradiol affected neointima formation after ligation of the carotid artery in ovariectomized female mice; estradiol reduced intimal hyperplasia to a similar extent in both WT (-80%) and COMTKO (-77%) mice. In ovarian-intact female COMTKO mice, atherosclerosis was decreased (-25%) compared with WT controls. In conclusion, the COMT enzyme is dispensable for vascular protection by exogenous estradiol in experimental atherosclerosis and neointima formation in vivo. Instead, COMT deficiency in virgin female mice with intact endogenous production of estradiol results in relative protection against atherosclerosis.",

        "Title": "A transient inhibition and permanent lack of catechol-O-methyltransferase have minor effects on feeding pattern of female rodents.",
        "Abstract": "Abnormal feeding behaviours have long been linked to disruptions in brain dopaminergic activity. Dopamine is metabolized, amongst others, by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Normally, COMT only plays a subordinate role in dopamine metabolism. However, changes in COMT activity, especially in the prefrontal cortex, become more important during events that evoke dopamine release. The current study investigated the effect of acute COMT inhibition on feeding in Wistar rats and C57BL/6 mice using a selective, brain penetrating COMT inhibitor (OR-1139). Furthermore, the effect of a long-term lack of COMT on feeding behaviour was studied in COMT-deficient (COMT -/-) mice. Apart from following the gross feeding behaviour of fasted rats and mice, the first 4 hr of re-feeding were recorded with a video camera to allow a more detailed analysis of feeding microstructure. In the acute study, rats and mice received a single injection of OR-1139 (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg), just before the experiment. We found that rats and mice receiving OR-1139 had fewer very short meals but more long meals than the controls. Treated mice even ate more frequently than the controls, but other feeding parameters remained unchanged. Conversely, COMT -/- mice displayed an increased latency to initiate the first meal and spent less total time eating than wild-type mice. In conclusion, although decreased/lack of COMT activity did not robustly alter feeding behaviour of female rodents, we observed some alterations in the microstructure of feeding. However, these minor changes were highly dependent on the extent and fashion in which COMT was manipulated.",

        "Abstract": "Despite its high heritability, a large fraction of individuals with schizophrenia do not have a family history of the disease (sporadic cases). Here we examined the possibility that rare de novo protein-altering mutations contribute to the genetic component of schizophrenia by sequencing the exomes of 53 sporadic cases, 22 unaffected controls and their parents. We identified 40 de novo mutations in 27 cases affecting 40 genes, including a potentially disruptive mutation in DGCR2, a gene located in the schizophrenia-predisposing 22q11.2 microdeletion region. A comparison to rare inherited variants indicated that the identified de novo mutations show a large excess of non-synonymous changes in schizophrenia cases, as well as a greater potential to affect protein structure and function. Our analyses suggest a major role for de novo mutations in schizophrenia as well as a large mutational target, which together provide a plausible explanation for the high global incidence and persistence of the disease.",

        "Abstract": "PSD-95, a principal scaffolding component of the postsynaptic density, is targeted to synapses by palmitoylation, where it couples NMDA receptor stimulation to production of nitric oxide (NO) by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Here, we show that PSD-95 is physiologically S-nitrosylated. We identify cysteines 3 and 5, which are palmitoylated, as sites of nitrosylation, suggesting a competition between these two modifications. In support of this hypothesis, physiologically produced NO inhibits PSD-95 palmitoylation in granule cells of the cerebellum, decreasing the number of PSD-95 clusters at synaptic sites. Further, decreased palmitoylation, as seen in heterologous cells treated with 2-bromopalmitate or in ZDHHC8 knockout mice deficient in a PSD-95 palmitoyltransferase, results in increased PSD-95 nitrosylation. These data support a model in which NMDA-mediated production of NO regulates targeting of PSD-95 to synapses via mutually competitive cysteine modifications. Thus, differential modification of cysteines may represent a general paradigm in signal transduction.",

Deletion of the orthologous chromosomal region in mice offers an opportunity to characterize changes to neuronal structure and function that may account for the development of this disease. The hippocampus has been implicated in schizophrenia pathogenesis, is reduced in volume in 22q11.2 deletion carriers and displays altered neuronal structure in a mouse model of the mutation (Df(16)A(+/-) mice). Here we investigate hippocampal CA1 physiology, hippocampal-dependent spatial memory and novelty-induced hippocampal activation in Df(16)A(+/-) mice. We found normal spatial reference memory (as assayed by the Morris water maze test) as well as modest but potentially important deficits in physiology. In particular, a reduction in the level of inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons was observed, implying a decrease in interneuron activity. Additionally, deficits in LTP were observed using certain induction protocols. Induction of c-Fos expression by exploration of a novel environment suggested a relative sparing of CA1 and dentate gyrus function but showed a robust decrease in the number of activated CA3 pyramidal neurons in Df(16)A(+/-) mice. Overall, experiments performed in this 22q11.2 deletion model demonstrated deficits of various degrees across different regions of the hippocampus, which together may contribute to the increased risk of developing schizophrenia.",

        "Abstract": "Individuals with 22q11.2 microdeletions have cognitive and behavioral impairments and the highest known genetic risk for developing schizophrenia. One gene disrupted by the 22q11.2 microdeletion is DGCR8, a component of the \"microprocessor\" complex that is essential for microRNA production, resulting in abnormal processing of specific brain miRNAs and working memory deficits. Here, we determine the effect of Dgcr8 deficiency on the structure and function of cortical circuits by assessing their laminar organization, as well as the neuronal morphology, and intrinsic and synaptic properties of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex of Dgcr8(+/-) mutant mice. We found that heterozygous Dgcr8 mutant mice have slightly fewer cortical layer 2/4 neurons and that the basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons have slightly smaller spines. In addition to the modest structural changes, field potential and whole-cell electrophysiological recordings performed in layer 5 of the prefrontal cortex revealed greater short-term synaptic depression during brief stimulation trains applied at 50 Hz to superficial cortical layers. This finding was accompanied by a decrease in the initial phase of synaptic potentiation. Our results identify altered short-term plasticity as a neural substrate underlying the cognitive dysfunction and the increased risk for schizophrenia associated with the 22q11.2 microdeletions.",

        "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, but despite some progress in identifying the genetic factors implicated in its development, the molecular mechanisms underlying its etiology and pathogenesis remain poorly understood. However, accumulating evidence suggests that regardless of the underlying genetic complexity, the mechanisms of the disease may impact a small number of common signaling pathways. In this review, we discuss the evidence for a role of schizophrenia susceptibility genes in intracellular signaling cascades by focusing on three prominent candidate genes: AKT, PPP3CC (calcineurin), and DISC1. We describe the regulation of a number of signaling cascades by AKT and calcineurin through protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and the recently uncovered functions of DISC1 in cAMP and GSK3beta signaling. In addition, we present independent evidence for the involvement of their downstream signaling pathways in schizophrenia. Finally, we discuss evidence supporting an impact of these susceptibility genes on common intracellular signaling pathways and the convergence of their effects on neuronal processes implicated in schizophrenia.",

        "Abstract": "Over the last fifteen years it has become established that 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a true genetic risk factor for schizophrenia. Carriers of deletions in chromosome 22q11.2 develop schizophrenia at rate of 25-30% and such deletions account for as many as 1-2% of cases of sporadic schizophrenia in the general population. Access to a relatively homogeneous population of individuals that suffer from schizophrenia as the result of a shared etiological factor and the potential to generate etiologically valid mouse models provides an immense opportunity to better understand the pathobiology of this disease. In this review we survey the clinical literature associated with the 22q11.2 microdeletions with a focus on neuroanatomical changes. Then, we highlight results from work modeling this structural mutation in animals. The key biological pathways disrupted by the mutation are discussed and how these changes impact the structure and function of neural circuits is described.",

        "Abstract": "Cannabis use confers a two-fold increase in the risk for psychosis, with adolescent use conferring even greater risk. A high-low activity catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) polymorphism may modulate the effects of adolescent \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exposure on the risk for adult psychosis. Mice with knockout of the COMT gene were treated chronically with THC (4.0 and 8.0 mg/kg over 20 days) during either adolescence (postnatal days (PDs) 32-52) or adulthood (PDs 70-90). The effects of THC exposure were then assessed in adulthood across behavioral phenotypes relevant for psychosis: exploratory activity, spatial working memory (spontaneous and delayed alternation), object recognition memory, social interaction (sociability and social novelty preference), and anxiety (elevated plus maze). Adolescent THC administration induced a larger increase in exploratory activity, greater impairment in spatial working memory, and a stronger anti-anxiety effect in COMT knockouts than in wild types, primarily among males. No such effects of selective adolescent THC administration were evident for other behaviors. Both object recognition memory and social novelty preference were disrupted by either adolescent or adult THC administration, independent of genotype. The COMT genotype exerts specific modulation of responsivity to chronic THC administration during adolescence in terms of exploratory activity, spatial working memory, and anxiety. These findings illuminate the interaction between genes and adverse environmental exposures over a particular stage of development in the expression of the psychosis phenotype.",

        "Abstract": "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) plays an active role in the metabolism of dopamine (DA) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Because of low levels of dopamine transporter (DAT), it is proposed that the majority of released DA is taken up by either norepinephrine transporter (NET) and subsequently metabolized by monoamine oxidize (MAO) or by uptake(2) (to glial cells and post-synaptic neurons) and metabolized by COMT. However, a comprehensive in vivo study of rating the mechanisms involved in DA clearance in the PFC has not been done. Here, we employ two types of microdialysis to study these pathways using DAT, NET and MAO blockers in conscious mice, with or without Comt gene disruption. In quantitative no-net-flux microdialysis, DA levels were increased by 60% in the PFC of COMT-knockout (ko) mice, but not in the striatum and nucleus accumbens. In conventional microdialysis studies, we showed that selective NET and MAO inhibition increased DA levels in the PFC of wild-type mice by two- to fourfold, an effect that was still doubled in COMT-ko mice. Inhibition of DAT had no effect on DA levels in either genotype. Therefore, we conclude that in the mouse, PFC COMT contributes about one half of the total DA clearance.",

        "Abstract": "Abnormalities in functional connectivity between brain areas have been postulated as an important pathophysiological mechanism underlying schizophrenia. In particular, macroscopic measurements of brain activity in patients suggest that functional connectivity between the frontal and temporal lobes may be altered. However, it remains unclear whether such dysconnectivity relates to the aetiology of the illness, and how it is manifested in the activity of neural circuits. Because schizophrenia has a strong genetic component, animal models of genetic risk factors are likely to aid our understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disease. Here we study Df(16)A(+/-) mice, which model a microdeletion on human chromosome 22 (22q11.2) that constitutes one of the largest known genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. To examine functional connectivity in these mice, we measured the synchronization of neural activity between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex during the performance of a task requiring working memory, which is one of the cognitive functions disrupted in the disease. In wild-type mice, hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony increased during working memory performance, consistent with previous reports in rats. Df(16)A(+/-) mice, which are impaired in the acquisition of the task, showed drastically reduced synchrony, measured both by phase-locking of prefrontal cells to hippocampal theta oscillations and by coherence of prefrontal and hippocampal local field potentials. Furthermore, the magnitude of hippocampal-prefrontal coherence at the onset of training could be used to predict the time it took the Df(16)A(+/-) mice to learn the task and increased more slowly during task acquisition. These data suggest how the deficits in functional connectivity observed in patients with schizophrenia may be realized at the single-neuron level. Our findings further suggest that impaired long-range synchrony of neural activity is one consequence of the 22q11.2 deletion and may be a fundamental component of the pathophysiology underlying schizophrenia.",

        "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric disorder that affects around 1% of the population worldwide. The disease is characterized by 'positive symptoms', 'negative symptoms' and cognitive deficits. Over the last 60 years, a large number of family, twin and adoption studies have clearly demonstrated a strong genetic component for schizophrenia, but the mode of inheritance of the disease is complex and, in all likelihood, involves contribution from multiple genes in conjunction with environmental and stochastic factors. Recently, several genome-wide scans have demonstrated that rare alleles contribute significantly to schizophrenia risk. Assessments of rare variants have identified specific and probably causative, disease-associated structural mutations or copy number variants (CNVs, which result from genomic gains or losses). The fact that the effects of such lesions are transparent allows the generation of etiologically valid animal models and the opportunity to explore the molecular, cellular and circuit-level abnormalities underlying the expression of psychopathology. To date, the most common genomic structural rearrangements that are unequivocally associated with the development of schizophrenia, are de novo microdeletions of the 22q11.2 locus. Fortunately, the human 22q11.2 locus is conserved within the syntenic region of mouse chromosome 16, which harbors nearly all orthologues of the human genes. This has made it possible to engineer genetically faithful, and thus etiologically valid, animal models of this schizophrenia susceptibility locus.",

        "Abstract": "To elucidate the genetic architecture of familial schizophrenia we combine linkage analysis with studies of fine-level chromosomal variation in families recruited from the Afrikaner population in South Africa. We demonstrate that individually rare inherited copy number variants (CNVs) are more frequent in cases with familial schizophrenia as compared to unaffected controls and affect almost exclusively genic regions. Interestingly, we find that while the prevalence of rare structural variants is similar in familial and sporadic cases, the type of variants is markedly different. In addition, using a high-density linkage scan with a panel of nearly 2,000 markers, we identify a region on chromosome 13q34 that shows genome-wide significant linkage to schizophrenia and show that in the families not linked to this locus, there is evidence for linkage to chromosome 1p36. No causative CNVs were identified in either locus. Overall, our results from approaches designed to detect risk variants with relatively low frequency and high penetrance in a well-defined and relatively homogeneous population, provide strong empirical evidence supporting the notion that multiple genetic variants, including individually rare ones, that affect many different genes contribute to the genetic risk of familial schizophrenia. They also highlight differences in the genetic architecture of the familial and sporadic forms of the disease.",

        "Abstract": "Animal models have been useful in elucidating the genetic basis of the cognitive and behavioural phenotypes associated with the 22q11.2 microdeletions. Loss-of-function models have implicated a number of genes as playing a role in prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response. Here, we report the generation and initial analysis of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic (Tg) mice, overexpressing genes from within the 22q11.2 locus. We used engineered BAC constructs to generate Tg lines and quantitative RT-PCR to assess levels of gene expression in each line. We assessed PPI and open-field activity in mice from two low copy number lines. In Tg-1, a line overexpressing Prodh and Vpreb2, PPI was significantly increased at prepulse levels of 78 dB and 82 dB while no differences were found in activity measures. By contrast, no significant differences were found in PPI testing of the Tg-2 line overexpressing Zdhhc8, Ranbp1, Htf9c, T10, Arvcf and Comt. Taken together with previous loss-of-function reports, these findings suggest that Prodh has a key role in modulating the degree of sensorimotor gating in mice and possibly in humans and provide additional support for an important role of this pathway in modulating behavioural deficits associated with genomic gains or losses at 22q11.2.",

We found sex specific changes in proteins connected to stress response. Our results show that alterations in protein levels contribute to the homeostatic regulation in the liver of COMT deficient mice.",

        "Abstract": "Individuals with 22q11.2 microdeletions have cognitive deficits and a high risk of developing schizophrenia. Here we provide evidence that primary hippocampal neurons from a mouse model of 22q11.2 deletion (Df(16)A(+/-) mice) have decreased density of dendritic spines and glutamatergic synapses, as well as impaired dendritic growth. These deficits were prevented by introduction of the enzymatically active ZDHHC8 palmitoyltransferase encoded by a gene in the 22q11.2 locus, and they were also observed in primary cultures from Zdhhc8-deficient mice. Many of these deficits were also present in the hippocampi of adult Df(16)A(+/-) and Zdhhc8-deficient mice. Finally, we provide evidence that PSD95 is one of the substrates of ZDHHC8. Our analysis reveals that 22q11.2 microdeletion results in deficits in neuronal development and suggests that impaired neuronal protein palmitoylation contributes to many of these deficits.",

        "Abstract": "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) polymorphisms modulate pain and opioid analgesia in human beings. It is not clear how the effects of COMT are mediated and only few relevant animal studies have been performed. Here, we used old male Comt gene knock-out mice as an animal model to study the effects of COMT deficiency on nociception that was assessed by the hot plate and tail flick tests. Stress-induced analgesia was achieved by forced swim. Morphine antinociception was measured after 10 mg/kg of morphine subcutaneously. Morphine tolerance was produced with subcutaneous morphine pellets and withdrawal provoked with subcutaneous naloxone. In the hot plate test, morphine-induced antinociception was significantly greater in the COMT knock-out mice, compared to the wild-type mice. This may be due to increased availability of opioid receptors as suggested by previous human studies. In the tail flick test, opioid-mediated stress-induced analgesia was absent and morphine-induced analgesia was decreased in COMT knock-out mice. In the hot plate test, stress-induced analgesia developed to all mice regardless of the COMT genotype. There were no differences between the genotypes in the baseline nociceptive thresholds, morphine tolerance and withdrawal. Our findings show, for the first time, the importance of COMT activity in stress- and morphine-induced analgesia in mice. COMT activity seems to take part in the modulation of nociception not only in the brain, as suggested earlier, but also at the spinal/peripheral level.",

        "Abstract": "The effect of catechol-O-methyltransferase (Comt) gene disruption on the voluntary oral consumption of water, ethanol (2.5-20%, v/v) and cocaine (0.1-0.8 mg/ml) was studied in the free-choice, two-bottle paradigm in male and female mice. Solutions containing ethanol or cocaine, or tap water were available ad libitum from drinking burettes for 4 weeks. Catechol-O-methyltransferase-deficient male mice consumed significantly more ethanol than their wild-type male littermates. In contrast, female mice did not show genotype differences in the consumption of ethanol solutions. During the cocaine experiment, male mice developed either a side preference or an aversion that obscured cocaine consumption. This pattern of drinking was not dependent on Comt genotype. In female mice, Comt genotype was not associated with cocaine consumption. In conclusion, disruption of Comt gene influenced ethanol consumption in a gender-dependent manner in mice, supporting the hypothesis that low catechol-O-methyltransferase activity is one of the predisposing factors for high alcohol consumption in males.",

        "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is an etiologically heterogeneous psychiatric disease, which exists in familial and nonfamilial (sporadic) forms. Here, we examine the possibility that rare de novo copy number (CN) mutations with relatively high penetrance contribute to the genetic component of schizophrenia. We carried out a whole-genome scan and implemented a number of steps for finding and confirming CN mutations. Confirmed de novo mutations were significantly associated with schizophrenia (P = 0.00078) and were collectively approximately 8 times more frequent in sporadic (but not familial) cases with schizophrenia than in unaffected controls. In comparison, rare inherited CN mutations were only modestly enriched in sporadic cases. Our results suggest that rare de novo germline mutations contribute to schizophrenia vulnerability in sporadic cases and that rare genetic lesions at many different loci can account, at least in part, for the genetic heterogeneity of this disease.",

Studies in preclinical models have demonstrated that impaired AKT signaling affects neuronal connectivity and neuromodulation and have identified AKT as a key signaling intermediary downstream of dopamine (DA) receptor 2 (DRD2), the best-established target of antipsychotic drugs. A study by Tan et al. in this issue of the JCI strengthens links among AKT signaling, DA transmission, and cognition in healthy individuals and offers potential avenues to explore in an effort to find more effective pharmacotherapies for schizophrenia and related disorders (see the related article beginning on page 2200).",

We analyzed an engineered mouse strain carrying a chromosomal deficiency spanning a segment syntenic to the human 22q11.2 locus. We uncovered a previously unknown alteration in the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) and identified a subset of brain miRNAs affected by the microdeletion. We provide evidence that the abnormal miRNA biogenesis emerges because of haploinsufficiency of the Dgcr8 gene, which encodes an RNA-binding moiety of the 'microprocessor' complex and contributes to the behavioral and neuronal deficits associated with the 22q11.2 microdeletion.",

        "Abstract": "DISC1 is a strong candidate susceptibility gene for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. Using a mouse strain carrying an endogenous Disc1 orthologue engineered to model the putative effects of the disease-associated chromosomal translocation we demonstrate that impaired Disc1 function results in region-specific morphological alterations, including alterations in the organization of newly born and mature neurons of the dentate gyrus. Field recordings at CA3/CA1 synapses revealed a deficit in short-term plasticity. Using a battery of cognitive tests we found a selective impairment in working memory (WM), which may relate to deficits in WM and executive function observed in individuals with schizophrenia. Our results implicate malfunction of neural circuits within the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex and selective deficits in WM as contributing to the genetic risk conferred by this gene.",

        "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence from clinical and preclinical studies shows that catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) plays a significant role in dopamine metabolism in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the striatum. However, to what extent dopamine overflow in the prefrontal cortex and striatum is controlled by enzymatic degradation versus reuptake is unknown. We used COMT deficient mice to investigate the role of COMT in these two brain regions with in vivo voltammetry. A real-time analysis of evoked dopamine overflow showed that removal of dopamine was twofold slower in the prefrontal cortex of mice lacking COMT than in wild-type mice, indicating that half of the dopamine decline in this brain region results from COMT-mediated enzymatic degradation. Lack of COMT did not influence dopamine overflow/decline in the dorsal striatum. COMT-deficient mice demonstrated a small (20-25%) but consistent increase in evoked dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the dorsal striatum. Cocaine affected equally dopaminergic neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex in both genotypes by prolonging 3-4 times dopamine elimination from extracellular space. Paradoxically, this happened without increase of the peak levels of evoked dopamine release. The present findings represent the first demonstration of the significant contribution of COMT in modulating the dynamics of dopamine overflow in the prefrontal cortex and underscore the therapeutic potential of manipulating COMT activity to alter dopaminergic neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex.",

        "Abstract": "There is accumulating evidence that AKT signaling plays a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We asked whether Akt1 deficiency in mice results in structural and functional abnormalities in prefrontal cortex (PFC). Exploratory transcriptional profiling revealed concerted alterations in the expression of PFC genes controlling synaptic function, neuronal development, myelination, and actin polymerization, and follow-up ultrastructural analysis identified consistent changes in the dendritic architecture of pyramidal neurons. Behavioral analysis indicated that Akt1-mutant mice have normal acquisition of a PFC-dependent cognitive task but abnormal working memory retention under neurochemical challenge of three distinct neurotransmitter systems. Thus, Akt1 deficiency creates a context permissive for gene-gene and gene-environment interactions that modulate PFC functioning and contribute to the disease risk associated with this locus, the severity of the clinical syndrome, or both.",

However, a more piecemeal recreation of phenotypic components is feasible and promises to harness the power of animal models using approaches that are either off limits or confounded by drug treatment in humans. In that context, animal models will have a central and indispensable role in the process of discovering the causes of psychiatric disorders and generating novel, mechanism-based treatments. Here, we discuss current approaches used to generate animal models of psychiatric disorders, address the different components of these disorders that can be modeled in animals, and describe currently available analytical tools. We also discuss accumulating empirical data and take an in-depth look at what we believe to be the future of animal models made possible by recent advances in psychiatric genetics.",

        "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide. It is characterized by so-called 'positive symptoms'--including delusions and hallucinations--'negative symptoms'--including blunted emotions and social isolation--and cognitive deficits--including impairments in attention and working memory. Studies of the inheritance of schizophrenia have revealed that it is a multifactorial disease that is characterized by multiple genetic susceptibility elements, each contributing a modest degree of risk. Linkage studies have identified several potential schizophrenia susceptibility loci, and in recent years major progress has been made in the identification of positional candidate susceptibility genes from these loci. A central goal of future research will be to use this genetic knowledge to generate specific animal models, characterize genetic interactions, investigate the disease pathophysiology and assist drug-discovery efforts.",

Here, we describe a deletion variant in mDisc1 specific to the 129S6/SvEv strain that introduces a termination codon at exon 7, abolishes production of the full-length protein, and impairs working memory performance when transferred to the C57BL/6J genetic background. Our findings provide insights into how DISC1 variation contributes to schizophrenia susceptibility in humans and the behavioral divergence between 129S6/SvEv and C57BL/6J mouse strains and have implications for modeling psychiatric diseases in mice.",

        "Abstract": "Microdeletions of 22q11.2 represent one of the highest known genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. It is likely that more than one gene contributes to the marked risk associated with this locus. Two of the candidate risk genes encode the enzymes proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which modulate the levels of a putative neuromodulator (L-proline) and the neurotransmitter dopamine, respectively. Mice that model the state of PRODH deficiency observed in humans with schizophrenia show increased neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic synapses as well as deficits in associative learning and response to psychomimetic drugs. Transcriptional profiling and pharmacological manipulations identified a transcriptional and behavioral interaction between the Prodh and Comt genes that is likely to represent a homeostatic response to enhanced dopaminergic signaling in the frontal cortex. This interaction modulates a number of schizophrenia-related phenotypes, providing a framework for understanding the high disease risk associated with this locus, the expression of the phenotype, or both.",

A number of studies have shown that the 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a true genetic subtype of schizophrenia and as such may play an extremely important role in deciphering the genetic basis of schizophrenia. Microdeletions of the 22q11 locus are associated with a staggering increased risk to develop schizophrenia. The same locus has also been implicated by some linkage studies. Systematic examination of individual genes from the 1.5 Mb critical region has identified so far the PRODH and ZDHHC8 as strong candidate schizophrenia susceptibility genes from this locus. Discovery of these genes implicates neuromodulatory aminoacids and protein palmitoylation as important for disease development. Other genes, including the gene encoding for COMT, have been implicated by candidate gene approaches. It therefore appears that the 22q11-associated schizophrenia may have the characteristics of a contiguous gene syndrome, where deficiency in more than one gene contributes to the strikingly increased disease risk. Mouse models for individual candidate genes will provide the investigators with the opportunity to start understanding the function of these genes and how they may impact on schizophrenia. Mouse models that carry long-range deletions will likely capture the interactions among the culprit genes and help explain the genetic contribution of this locus to the high risk for schizophrenia. In-depth human and animal model studies of 22q11DS promise to answer critical questions relating to the devastating illness of schizophrenia, whose causes remain largely unknown.",

        "Title": "Lack of increased oxidative stress in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-deficient mice.",
        "Abstract": "The effect of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) deficiency on methamphetamine-induced hydroxyl radical production in the brain was assessed by the salicylate trapping method. Methamphetamine-induced hyperthermia was also studied. Furthermore, the effect of COMT deficiency on the activities of glutathione S-transferase, quinone reductase and liver mono-oxygenases was assessed with and without l-dopa challenge. Finally, two alternative pathways of l-dopa metabolism were evaluated. Methamphetamine increased 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid levels only slightly (n.s.) at the lowest dose level (2.5 mg/kg x 4 i.p.). This was accompanied by a simultaneous increase in salicylate levels so that the 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid/salicylate ratio decreased correspondingly. Most importantly, no COMT genotype-dependent changes were observed. However, hyperthermia was induced even at the lowest methamphetamine dose, the COMT-deficient mice being most sensitive. COMT deficiency did not significantly change the activities of liver glutathione S-transferase, quinone reductase or 7-ethoxyresorufin and 7-pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylation. In COMT-deficient female mice, l-dopa (30-80 mg/kg b.i.d. for 2 days) did not induce any significant changes in liver or brain glutathione S-transferase and quinone reductase activity or liver 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation activity. The levels of l-dopa conjugates in urine were also negligible in COMT-deficient mice. Skin tyrosinase activity was increased in 7- to 8-day-old hairless COMT-deficient pups. The present results suggest that despite the increased hyperthermic response, COMT deficiency does not increase methamphetamine-induced hydroxyl radical production or change significantly the activity of certain enzymes involved in defense against reactive oxygen species. In conclusion, we found no evidence of increased oxidative stress in the liver or brain of adult mice lacking COMT activity.",

        "Abstract": "Using a relatively dense genetic map of 72 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed across the entire 1.5-Mb locus on chromosome 22q11 associated with susceptibilit to schizophrenia, we previously identified two subregions that were consistently associated with the disease. In the distal subregion, we detected an association signal with five neighboring SNPs distributed over a haplotypic block of 80 kb encompassing six known genes. One of these five SNPs, rs175174, had the strongest association of all 72 SNPs that we tested. Here we show that rs175174 regulates the level of the fully functional transcript by modulating the retention of intron 4 of the gene ZDHHC8, which encodes a putative transmembrane palmitoyltransferase. Zdhhc8-knockout mice had a sexually dimorphic deficit in prepulse inhibition, a gene dosage-dependent decrease in exploratory activity in a new environment and a decreased sensitivity to the locomotor stimulatory effects of the psychomimetic drug dizocilpine (MK801). SNP rs175174 shows differences in transmission distortion between sexes in individuals with schizophrenia. Our results indicate that there is an unexpected connection between impaired palmitate modification of neuronal proteins and the psychiatric phenotypes associated with microdeletions of chromosome 22q11.",

        "Abstract": "We have developed a genetic approach to examine the role of spontaneous activity and synaptic release in the establishment and maintenance of an olfactory sensory map. Conditional expression of tetanus toxin light chain, a molecule that inhibits synaptic release, does not perturb targeting during development, but neurons that express this molecule in a competitive environment fail to maintain appropriate synaptic connections and disappear. Overexpression of the inward rectifying potassium channel, Kir2.1, diminishes the excitability of sensory neurons and more severely disrupts the formation of an olfactory map. These studies suggest that spontaneous neural activity is required for the establishment and maintenance of the precise connectivity inherent in an olfactory sensory map.",

Here we show, in two independent samples of brains from patients with schizophrenia, a significant decrease in the phosphorylation level at serine 897 (S897) of the NMDA receptor type 1 (NR1) subunit. Our finding, together with a previous report that antipsychotics increase phosphorylation of NR1 at S897 in vivo, strongly suggests that insufficient phosphorylation at S897 may contribute to the neuronal pathology underlying schizophrenia.",

        "Abstract": "We report on our initial genetic linkage studies of schizophrenia in the genetically isolated population of the Afrikaners from South Africa. A 10-cM genomewide scan was performed on 143 small families, 34 of which were informative for linkage. Using both nonparametric and parametric linkage analyses, we obtained evidence for a small number of disease loci on chromosomes 1, 9, and 13. These results suggest that few genes of substantial effect exist for schizophrenia in the Afrikaner population, consistent with our previous genealogical tracing studies. The locus on chromosome 1 reached genomewide significance levels (nonparametric LOD score of 3.30 at marker D1S1612, corresponding to an empirical P value of.012) and represents a novel susceptibility locus for schizophrenia. In addition to providing evidence for linkage for chromosome 1, we also identified a proband with a uniparental disomy (UPD) of the entire chromosome 1. This is the first time a UPD has been described in a patient with schizophrenia, lending further support to involvement of chromosome 1 in schizophrenia susceptibility in the Afrikaners.",

        "Abstract": "AKT-GSK3beta signaling is a target of lithium and as such has been implicated in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. Here, we provide evidence that this signaling pathway also has a role in schizophrenia. Specifically, we present convergent evidence for a decrease in AKT1 protein levels and levels of phosphorylation of GSK3beta at Ser9 in the peripheral lymphocytes and brains of individuals with schizophrenia; a significant association between schizophrenia and an AKT1 haplotype associated with lower AKT1 protein levels; and a greater sensitivity to the sensorimotor gating-disruptive effect of amphetamine, conferred by AKT1 deficiency. Our findings support the proposal that alterations in AKT1-GSK3beta signaling contribute to schizophrenia pathogenesis and identify AKT1 as a potential schizophrenia susceptibility gene. Consistent with this proposal, we also show that haloperidol induces a stepwise increase in regulatory phosphorylation of AKT1 in the brains of treated mice that could compensate for an impaired function of this signaling pathway in schizophrenia.",

        "Abstract": "Founder populations hold tremendous promise for mapping genes for complex traits, as they offer less genetic and environmental heterogeneity and greater potential for genealogical research. Not all founder populations are equally valuable, however. The Afrikaner population meets several criteria that make it an ideal population for mapping complex traits, including founding by a small number of initial founders that likely allowed for a relatively restricted set of mutations and a large current population size that allows identification of a sufficient number of cases. Here, we examine the potential to conduct genealogical research in this population and present initial results indicating that accurate genealogical tracing for up to 17 generations is feasible. We also examine the clinical similarities of schizophrenia cases diagnosed in South Africa and those diagnosed in other, heterogeneous populations, specifically the US. We find that, with regard to basic sample descriptors and cardinal symptoms of disease, the two populations are equivalent. It is, therefore, likely that results from our genetic study of schizophrenia will be applicable to other populations. Based on the results presented here, the history and current size of the population, as well as our previous analysis addressing the extent of background linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the Afrikaners, we conclude that the Afrikaner population is likely an appropriate founder population to map genes for schizophrenia using both linkage and LD approaches.",

Forebrain-specific CNB knockout mice display a spectrum of behavioral abnormalities related to altered behaviors observed in schizophrenia patients. To examine whether calcineurin dysfunction is involved in schizophrenia etiology, we undertook studies of an initial subset of calcineurin-related genes, prioritizing ones that map to loci previously implicated in schizophrenia by linkage studies. Transmission disequilibrium studies in a large sample of affected families detected association of the PPP3CC gene, which encodes the calcineurin gamma catalytic subunit, with disease. Our results identify PPP3CC, located at 8p21.3, as a potential schizophrenia susceptibility gene and support the proposal that alterations in calcineurin signaling contribute to schizophrenia pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "We evaluated a possible association between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene and susceptibility to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) by genotyping a number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one microsatellite marker from the extended BDNF locus in 164 triads with OCD. Extensive background linkage disequilibrium was observed at this locus. Single-locus transmission-distortion tests revealed significant evidence of association with the disease for all the BDNF gene markers tested, including a Val66Met variation affecting the sequence of the proBDNF protein. Analysis of multi-SNP haplotypes provided similar results. Haplotype transmission comparisons in this and previous studies point to a functionally distinct BDNF haplotype uniquely marked by the rare Met66 allele, which is undertransmitted and likely confers a protective effect in OCD and other psychiatric disorders.",

        "Abstract": "An increased prevalence of microdeletions at the 22q11 locus has been reported in samples of patients with schizophrenia. 22q11 microdeletions represent the highest known genetic risk factor for the development of schizophrenia, second only to that of the monozygotic cotwin of an affected individual or the offspring of two schizophrenic parents. It is therefore clear that a schizophrenia susceptibility locus maps to chromosome 22q11. In light of evidence for suggestive linkage for schizophrenia in this region, we hypothesized that, whereas deletions of chromosome 22q11 may account for only a small proportion of schizophrenia cases in the general population (up to approximately 2%), nondeletion variants of individual genes within the 22q11 region may make a larger contribution to susceptibility to schizophrenia in the wider population. By studying a dense collection of markers (average one single nucleotide polymorphism20 kb over 1.5 Mb) in the vicinity of the 22q11 locus, in both family- and population-based samples, we present here results consistent with this assumption. Moreover, our results are consistent with contribution from more than one gene to the strikingly increased disease risk associated with this locus. Finer-scale haplotype mapping has identified two subregions within the 1.5-Mb locus that are likely to harbor candidate schizophrenia susceptibility genes.",

        "Abstract": "Two different uptake processes terminate the synaptic action of released catecholamines in brain: the high-affinity uptake to presynaptic nerve terminals (uptake(1), followed by oxidation by monoamine oxidase, MAO) or glial cells uptake (uptake(2), followed by O-methylation by catechol-O-methyltransferase, COMT, and/or oxidation by MAO). For dopaminergic neurons, uptake by the high-affinity dopamine transporter (DAT) is the most effective mechanism, and the contribution of glial COMT remains secondary under normal conditions. In the present study we have characterized the role of COMT using COMT-deficient mice in conditions where DAT is inhibited by 1-[2-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl)-piperazine (GBR 12909) or cocaine. In mice lacking COMT, GBR 12909 results in total brain tissue dopamine levels generally higher than in wild-type mice but no such potentiation was ever seen in striatal extracellular fluid. Dopamine accumulation in nerve endings is more evident in striatum and hypothalamus than in cortex. Both GBR 12909 and cocaine induced hyperlocomotion in mice lacking COMT. Unexpectedly, hyperactivity induced by 20 mg/kg GBR 12909 was attenuated only in male COMT knockout mice, i.e., they had an inability to sustain the hyperactivity induced by DAT inhibition. Furthermore, attenuation of hyperlocomotion was observed also after cocaine treatment in both C57BL/6 (at 5 and 15 mg/kg) and 129/Sv (at 30 mg/kg) genetic background COMT-deficient male mice. Despite the possible interaction between DAT and extraneuronal uptake (and subsequently COMT), the role of COMT in dopamine elimination is still minimal in conditions when DAT is inhibited.",

We analyzed intermarker LD in 62 nuclear families using microsatellite markers covering extended chromosomal regions. The markers were selected to allow the first direct comparison of long-range LD in the Afrikaners to LD in other demographic groups. Using several statistical measures, we find significant evidence for LD in the Afrikaners extending remarkably over a 6-cM range. In contrast, LD decays significantly beyond 3-cM distances in the other founder and outbred populations examined. This study strongly supports the appropriateness of the Afrikaner population for genome-wide scans that exploit LD to map common, multigenic disorders.",

        "Title": "Genetic variation at the 22q11 PRODH2/DGCR6 locus presents an unusual pattern and increases susceptibility to schizophrenia.",
        "Abstract": "The location of a schizophrenia susceptibility locus at chromosome 22q11 has been suggested by genome-wide linkage studies. Additional support was provided by the observation of a higher-than-expected frequency of 22q11 microdeletions in patients with schizophrenia and the demonstration that approximately 20-30% of individuals with 22q11 microdeletions develop schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in adolescence and adulthood. Analysis of the extent of these microdeletions by using polymorphic markers afforded further refinement of this locus to a region of approximately 1.5 Mb. Recently, a high rate of 22q11 microdeletions was also reported for a cohort of 47 patients with Childhood Onset Schizophrenia, a rare and severe form of schizophrenia with onset by age 13. It is therefore likely that this 1.5-Mb region contains one or more genes that predispose to schizophrenia. In three independent samples, we provide evidence for a contribution of the PRODH2/DGCR6 locus in 22q11-associated schizophrenia. We also uncover an unusual pattern of PRODH2 gene variation that mimics the sequence of a linked pseudogene. Several of the pseudogene-like variants we identified result in missense changes at conserved residues and may prevent synthesis of a fully functional enzyme. Our results have implications for understanding the genetic basis of the 22q11-associated psychiatric phenotypes and provide further insights into the genomic instability of this region.",

        "Abstract": "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) catalyses the O-methylation of compounds having a catechol structure and its main function involves the elimination of biologically active or toxic catechols and their metabolites. By means of homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells, a strain of mice has been produced in which the gene encoding the COMT enzyme is disrupted. We report here the levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in striatal extracellular fluid in these mice as well as in homogenates from different parts of the brain, under normal conditions and after acute levodopa administration. In immunoblotting studies, COMT-knockout mice had no COMT protein in brain or kidney tissues but the amounts of catecholamine synthesizing and other metabolizing enzyme proteins were normal. Under normal conditions, COMT deficiency does not appear to affect significantly brain dopamine and noradrenaline levels in spite of relevant changes in their metabolites. This finding is consistent with previous pharmacological studies with COMT inhibitors and confirms the pivotal role of synaptic reuptake processes and monoamine oxidase-dependent metabolism in terminating the actions of catecholamines at nerve terminals. In contrast, when COMT-deficient mice are challenged with l-dihydroxyphenylalanine, they show an extensive accumulation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and dihydroxyphenylglycol and even dopamine, revealing an important role for COMT under such situations. Notably, in some cases these changes appear to be Comt gene dosage-dependent, brain-region specific and sexually dimorphic. Our results may have implications for improving the treatment of Parkinson's disease and for understanding the contribution of the natural variation in COMT activity to psychiatric phenotypes.",
