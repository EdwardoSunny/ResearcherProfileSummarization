The COmmunicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Early Warning System (EWS) uses real-time nursing surveillance documentation patterns in its machine learning algorithm to identify patients' deterioration risk up to 42 hours earlier than other EWSs.",

        "Abstract": "Recruitment of participants is the greatest risk to completion of most clinical trials, with 20-40% of trials failing to reach the targeted enrollment. This is particularly true of trials of central nervous system (CNS) therapies such as intervention for chronic stroke. The PISCES III trial was an invasive trial of stereotactically guided intracerebral injection of CTX0E03, a fetal derived neural stem cell line, in patients with chronic disability due to ischemic stroke. We report on the experience using a novel hybrid recruitment approach of a patient-facing portal to self-identify and perform an initial screen for general trial eligibility (tier 1), followed by phone screening and medical records review (tier 2) prior to a final in-person visit to confirm eligibility and consent.",

        "Abstract": "The protocols and therapeutic guidance established for treating traumatic brain injuries (TBI) in neurointensive care focus on managing cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain tissue oxygenation based on pressure signals. The decision support process relies on assumed relationships between cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and blood flow, pressure-flow relationships (PFRs), and shares this framework of assumptions with mathematical intracranial hemodynamic models. These foundational assumptions are difficult to verify, and their violation can impact clinical decision-making and model validity.",

        "Abstract": "Refined management of mechanically ventilation is an obvious target for improving patient outcomes, but is impeded by the nature of data for study and hypothesis generation. The connections between clinical outcomes and temporal development of iatrogenic injuries current lung-protective ventilator settings remain poorly understood. Analysis of lung-ventilator system (LVS) evolution at relevant timescales is frustrated by data volume and multiple sources of heterogeneity. This work motivates, presents, and validates a computational pipeline for resolving LVS systems into the joint evolution of data-conditioned model parameters and ventilator information. Applied to individuals, the workflow yields a concise low-dimensional representation of LVS behavior expressed in phenotypic breath waveforms suitable for analysis. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through application to multi-day observational series of 35 patients. Individual patient analyses reveal multiple types of patient-oriented dynamics and breath behavior to expose the complexity of LVS evolution; less than 10% of phenotype changes related to ventilator settings changes. Dynamics are shown to including both stable and unstable phenotype transitions as well as both discrete and continuous changes unrelated to ventilator settings. At a cohort scale, 721 phenotypes constructed from individual data are condensed into a set of 16 groups that empirically organize around certain settings (positive end-expository pressure and ventilator mode) and structurally similar pressure-volume loop characterizations. Individual and cohort scale phenotypes, which may be refined by hypothesis-specific constructions, provide a common framework for ongoing temporal analysis and investigation of LVS dynamics.",

        "Abstract": "Invasive mechanical ventilation can worsen lung injury. Ventilator dyssynchrony (VD) may propagate ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and is challenging to detect and systematically monitor because each patient takes approximately 25,000 breaths a day yet some types of VD are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all breaths. Therefore, we sought to develop and validate accurate machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect multiple types of VD by leveraging esophageal pressure waveform data to quantify patient effort with airway pressure, flow, and volume data generated during mechanical ventilation, building a computational pipeline to facilitate the study of VD.",

        "Abstract": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury have a diverse spectrum of causative factors including sepsis, aspiration of gastric contents, and near drowning. Clinical management of severe lung injury typically includes mechanical ventilation to maintain gas exchange which can lead to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). The cause of respiratory failure is acknowledged to affect the degree of lung inflammation, changes in lung structure, and the mechanical function of the injured lung. However, these differential effects of injury and the role of etiology in the structure-function relationship are not fully understood. To address this knowledge gap we caused lung injury with intratracheal hydrochloric acid (HCL) or endotoxin (LPS) 2\u00a0days prior to ventilation or with an injurious lavage (LAV) immediately prior to ventilation. These injury groups were then ventilated with high inspiratory pressures and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) = 0\u00a0cmH",

        "Abstract": "Forecasting blood glucose (BG) levels with routinely collected data is useful for glycemic management. BG dynamics are nonlinear, complex, and nonstationary, which can be represented by nonlinear models. However, the sparsity of routinely collected data creates parameter identifiability issues when high-fidelity complex models are used, thereby resulting in inaccurate forecasts. One can use models with reduced physiological fidelity for robust and accurate parameter estimation and forecasting with sparse data. For this purpose, we approximate the nonlinear dynamics of BG regulation by a linear stochastic differential equation: we develop a linear stochastic model, which can be specialized to different settings: type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and intensive care unit (ICU), with different choices of appropriate model functions. The model includes deterministic terms quantifying glucose removal from the bloodstream through the glycemic regulation system and representing the effect of nutrition and externally delivered insulin. The stochastic term encapsulates the BG oscillations. The model output is in the form of an expected value accompanied by a band around this value. The model parameters are estimated patient-specifically, leading to personalized models. The forecasts consist of values for BG mean and variation, quantifying possible high and low BG levels. Such predictions have potential use for glycemic management as part of control systems. We present experimental results on parameter estimation and forecasting in T2DM and ICU settings. We compare the model's predictive capability with two different nonlinear models built for T2DM and ICU contexts to have a sense of the level of prediction achieved by this model.",

        "Abstract": "A normally functioning menstrual cycle requires significant crosstalk between hormones originating in ovarian and brain tissues. Reproductive hormone dysregulation may cause abnormal function and sometimes infertility. The inherent complexity in this endocrine system is a challenge to identifying mechanisms of cycle disruption, particularly given the large number of unknown parameters in existing mathematical models. We develop a new endocrine model to limit model complexity and use simulated distributions of unknown parameters for model analysis. By employing a comprehensive model evaluation, we identify a collection of mechanisms that differentiate normal and abnormal phenotypes. We also discover an intermediate phenotype-displaying relatively normal hormone levels and cycle dynamics-that is grouped statistically with the irregular phenotype. Results provide insight into how clinical symptoms associated with ovulatory disruption may not be detected through hormone measurements alone.",

        "Abstract": "Mechanical ventilation is an essential tool in the management of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), but it exposes patients to the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). The human lung-ventilator system (LVS) involves the interaction of complex anatomy with a mechanical apparatus, which limits the ability of process-based models to provide individualized clinical support. This work proposes a hypothesis-driven strategy for LVS modeling in which robust personalization is achieved using a pre-defined parameter basis in a non-physiological model. Model inversion, here via windowed data assimilation, forges observed waveforms into interpretable parameter values that characterize the data rather than quantifying physiological processes. Accurate, model-based inference on human-ventilator data indicates model flexibility and utility over a variety of breath types, including those from dyssynchronous LVSs. Estimated parameters generate static characterizations of the data that are 50%-70% more accurate than breath-wise single-compartment model estimates. They also retain sufficient information to distinguish between the types of breath they represent. However, the fidelity and interpretability of model characterizations are tied to parameter definitions and model resolution. These additional factors must be considered in conjunction with the objectives of specific applications, such as identifying and tracking the development of human VILI.",

        "Abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex and under-treated disorder closely intertwined with obesity. Adolescents with severe obesity and type 2 diabetes have a more aggressive disease compared to adults, with a rapid decline in pancreatic \u03b2 cell function and increased incidence of comorbidities. Given the relative paucity of pharmacotherapies, bariatric surgery has become increasingly used as a therapeutic option. However, subsets of this population have sub-optimal outcomes with either inadequate weight loss or little improvement in disease. Predicting which patients will benefit from surgery is a difficult task and detailed physiological characteristics of patients who do not respond to treatment are generally unknown. Identifying physiological predictors of surgical response therefore has the potential to reveal both novel phenotypes of disease as well as therapeutic targets. We leverage data assimilation paired with mechanistic models of glucose metabolism to estimate pre-operative physiological states of bariatric surgery patients, thereby identifying latent phenotypes of impaired glucose metabolism. Specifically, maximal insulin secretion capacity, \u03c3, and insulin sensitivity, S",

(Chaos, 2021, 31, 023142)). This paper assesses the impact of DIU on the ability of the glucose-insulin system to maintain homeostasis when responding to the ingestion of meals. We address two questions. First, what is the nature of the DIU phenotype? That is, what physiological macrostates (as encoded by physiological parameters) allow for DIU onset? Second, how does DIU impact health? We find that the DIU phenotype is abundant in the space of intrinsic parameters for the Ultradian glucose-insulin model-a model that has been successfully used to predict glucose-insulin dynamics in humans. Configurations of intrinsic parameters that correspond to high characteristic glucose levels facilitate DIU onset. We argue that DIU is pathogenic for obesity and type-2 diabetes mellitus by linking the statistical profile of DIU to the glucostatic theory of hunger.",

        "Abstract": "Self-tracking can help personalize self-management interventions for chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes (T2D), but reflecting on personal data requires motivation and literacy. Machine learning (ML) methods can identify patterns, but a key challenge is making actionable suggestions based on personal health data. We introduce GlucoGoalie, which combines ML with an expert system to translate ML output into personalized nutrition goal suggestions for individuals with T2D. In a controlled experiment, participants with T2D found that goal suggestions were understandable and actionable. A 4-week in-the-wild deployment study showed that receiving goal suggestions augmented participants' self-discovery, choosing goals highlighted the multifaceted nature of personal preferences, and the experience of following goals demonstrated the importance of feedback and context. However, we identified tensions between abstract goals and concrete eating experiences and found static text too ambiguous for complex concepts. We discuss implications for ML-based interventions and the need for systems that offer more interactivity, feedback, and negotiation.",

        "Abstract": "Every year, hundreds of thousands of inpatients die from cardiac arrest and sepsis, which could be avoided if those patients' risk for deterioration were detected and timely interventions were initiated. Thus, a system is needed to convert real-time, raw patient data into consumable information that clinicians can utilize to identify patients at risk of deterioration and thus prevent mortality and improve patient health outcomes. The overarching goal of the COmmunicating Narrative Concerns Entered by Registered Nurses (CONCERN) study is to implement and evaluate an early warning score system that provides clinical decision support (CDS) in electronic health record systems. With a combination of machine learning and natural language processing, the CONCERN CDS utilizes nursing documentation patterns as indicators of nurses' increased surveillance to predict when patients are at the risk of clinical deterioration.",

        "Title": "A Damaged-Informed Lung Ventilator Model for Ventilator Waveforms.",
        "Abstract": "Motivated by a desire to understand pulmonary physiology, scientists have developed physiological lung models of varying complexity. However, pathophysiology and interactions between human lungs and ventilators, e.g., ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), present challenges for modeling efforts. This is because the real-world pressure and volume signals may be too complex for simple models to capture, and while complex models tend not to be estimable with clinical data, limiting clinical utility. To address this gap, in this manuscript we developed a new damaged-informed lung ventilator (DILV) model. This approach relies on mathematizing ventilator pressure and volume waveforms, including lung physiology, mechanical ventilation, and their interaction. The model begins with nominal waveforms and adds limited, clinically relevant, hypothesis-driven features to the waveform corresponding to pulmonary pathophysiology, patient-ventilator interaction, and ventilator settings. The DILV model parameters uniquely and reliably recapitulate these features while having enough flexibility to reproduce commonly observed variability in clinical (human) and laboratory (mouse) waveform data. We evaluate the proof-in-principle capabilities of our modeling approach by estimating 399 breaths collected for differently damaged lungs for tightly controlled measurements in mice and uncontrolled human intensive care unit data in the absence and presence of ventilator dyssynchrony. The cumulative value of mean squares error for the DILV model is, on average, \u224812 times less than the single compartment lung model for all the waveforms considered. Moreover, changes in the estimated parameters correctly correlate with known measures of lung physiology, including lung compliance as a baseline evaluation. Our long-term goal is to use the DILV model for clinical monitoring and research studies by providing high fidelity estimates of lung state and sources of VILI with an end goal of improving management of VILI and acute respiratory distress syndrome.",

Noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) estimation that operates sufficiently fast at multihour timescales and requires only common patient measurements is a desirable tool for clinical decision support and improving traumatic brain injury patient outcomes. However, existing model-based nICP estimation methods may be too slow or require data that are not easily obtained.",

        "Abstract": "Medical practice in the intensive care unit is based on the assumption that physiological systems such as the human glucose-insulin system are predictable. We demonstrate that delay within the glucose-insulin system can induce sustained temporal chaos, rendering the system unpredictable. Specifically, we exhibit such chaos for the ultradian glucose-insulin model. This well-validated, finite-dimensional model represents feedback delay as a three-stage filter. Using the theory of rank one maps from smooth dynamical systems, we precisely explain the nature of the resulting delay-induced uncertainty (DIU). We develop a framework one may use to diagnose DIU in a general oscillatory dynamical system. For infinite-dimensional delay systems, no analog of the theory of rank one maps exists. Nevertheless, we show that the geometric principles encoded in our DIU framework apply to such systems by exhibiting sustained temporal chaos for a linear shear flow. Our results are potentially broadly applicable because delay is ubiquitous throughout mathematical physiology.",

        "Title": "Ventilator dyssynchrony - Detection, pathophysiology, and clinical relevance: A Narrative review.",
        "Abstract": "Mortality associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome remains unacceptably high due in part to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Ventilator dyssynchrony is defined as the inappropriate timing and delivery of a mechanical breath in response to patient effort and may cause VILI. Such deleterious patient-ventilator interactions have recently been termed patient self-inflicted lung injury. This narrative review outlines the detection and frequency of several different types of ventilator dyssynchrony, delineates the different mechanisms by which ventilator dyssynchrony may propagate VILI, and reviews the potential clinical impact of ventilator dyssynchrony. Until recently, identifying ventilator dyssynchrony required the manual interpretation of ventilator pressure and flow waveforms. However, computerized interpretation of ventilator waive forms can detect ventilator dyssynchrony with an area under the receiver operating curve of >0.80. Using such algorithms, ventilator dyssynchrony occurs in 3%-34% of all breaths, depending on the patient population. Moreover, two types of ventilator dyssynchrony, double-triggered and flow-limited breaths, are associated with the more frequent delivery of large tidal volumes >10 mL/kg when compared with synchronous breaths (54% [95% confidence interval (CI), 47%-61%] and 11% [95% CI, 7%-15%]) compared with 0.9% (95% CI, 0.0%-1.9%), suggesting a role in propagating VILI. Finally, a recent study associated frequent dyssynchrony-defined as >10% of all breaths-with an increase in hospital mortality (67 vs. 23%, ",

        "Abstract": "Decision-making related to health is complex. Machine learning (ML) and patient generated data can identify patterns and insights at the individual level, where human cognition falls short, but not all ML-generated information is of equal utility for making health-related decisions. We develop and apply attributable components analysis (ACA), a method inspired by optimal transport theory, to type 2 diabetes self-monitoring data to identify patterns of association between nutrition and blood glucose control. In comparison with linear regression, we found that ACA offers a number of characteristics that make it promising for use in decision support applications. For example, ACA was able to identify non-linear relationships, was more robust to outliers, and offered broader and more expressive uncertainty estimates. In addition, our results highlight a tradeoff between model accuracy and interpretability, and we discuss implications for ML-driven decision support systems.",

        "Abstract": "Semisupervised and unsupervised anomaly detection methods have been widely used in various applications to detect anomalous objects from a given data set. Specifically, these methods are popular in the medical domain because of their suitability for applications where there is a lack of a sufficient data set for the other classes. Infection incidence often brings prolonged hyperglycemia and frequent insulin injections in people with type 1 diabetes, which are significant anomalies. Despite these potentials, there have been very few studies that focused on detecting infection incidences in individuals with type 1 diabetes using a dedicated personalized health model.",

        "Title": "The parameter Houlihan: A solution to high-throughput identifiability indeterminacy for brutally ill-posed problems.",
        "Abstract": "One way to interject knowledge into clinically impactful forecasting is to use data assimilation, a nonlinear regression that projects data onto a mechanistic physiologic model, instead of a set of functions, such as neural networks. Such regressions have an advantage of being useful with particularly sparse, non-stationary clinical data. However, physiological models are often nonlinear and can have many parameters, leading to potential problems with parameter identifiability, or the ability to find a unique set of parameters that minimize forecasting error. The identifiability problems can be minimized or eliminated by reducing the number of parameters estimated, but reducing the number of estimated parameters also reduces the flexibility of the model and hence increases forecasting error. We propose a method, the parameter Houlihan, that combines traditional machine learning techniques with data assimilation, to select the right set of model parameters to minimize forecasting error while reducing identifiability problems. The method worked well: the data assimilation-based glucose forecasts and estimates for our cohort using the Houlihan-selected parameter sets generally also minimize forecasting errors compared to other parameter selection methods such as by-hand parameter selection. Nevertheless, the forecast with the lowest forecast error does not always accurately represent physiology, but further advancements of the algorithm provide a path for improving physiologic fidelity as well. Our hope is that this methodology represents a first step toward combining machine learning with data assimilation and provides a lower-threshold entry point for using data assimilation with clinical data by helping select the right parameters to estimate.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder that causes abnormal blood glucose (BG) regulation that might result in short and long-term health complications and even death if not properly managed. Currently, there is no cure for diabetes. However, self-management of the disease, especially keeping BG in the recommended range, is central to the treatment. This includes actively tracking BG levels and managing physical activity, diet, and insulin intake. The recent advancements in diabetes technologies and self-management applications have made it easier for patients to have more access to relevant data. In this regard, the development of an artificial pancreas (a closed-loop system), personalized decision systems, and BG event alarms are becoming more apparent than ever. Techniques such as predicting BG (modeling of a personalized profile), and modeling BG dynamics are central to the development of these diabetes management technologies. The increased availability of sufficient patient historical data has paved the way for the introduction of machine learning and its application for intelligent and improved systems for diabetes management. The capability of machine learning to solve complex tasks with dynamic environment and knowledge has contributed to its success in diabetes research.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that results in abnormal blood glucose (BG) regulations. The BG level is preferably maintained close to normality through self-management practices, which involves actively tracking BG levels and taking proper actions including adjusting diet and insulin medications. BG anomalies could be defined as any undesirable reading because of either a precisely known reason (normal cause variation) or an unknown reason (special cause variation) to the patient. Recently, machine-learning applications have been widely introduced within diabetes research in general and BG anomaly detection in particular. However, irrespective of their expanding and increasing popularity, there is a lack of up-to-date reviews that materialize the current trends in modeling options and strategies for BG anomaly classification and detection in people with diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "Ensemble Kalman methods constitute an increasingly important tool in both state and parameter estimation problems. Their popularity stems from the derivative-free nature of the methodology which may be readily applied when computer code is available for the underlying state-space dynamics (for state estimation) or for the parameter-to-observable map (for parameter estimation). There are many applications in which it is desirable to enforce prior information in the form of equality or inequality constraints on the state or parameter. This paper establishes a general framework for doing so, describing a widely applicable methodology, a theory which justifies the methodology, and a set of numerical experiments exemplifying it.",

        "Abstract": "We introduce data assimilation as a computational method that uses machine learning to combine data with human knowledge in the form of mechanistic models in order to forecast future states, to impute missing data from the past by smoothing, and to infer measurable and unmeasurable quantities that represent clinically and scientifically important phenotypes. We demonstrate the advantages it affords in the context of type 2 diabetes by showing how data assimilation can be used to forecast future glucose values, to impute previously missing glucose values, and to infer type 2 diabetes phenotypes. At the heart of data assimilation is the mechanistic model, here an endocrine model. Such models can vary in complexity, contain testable hypotheses about important mechanics that govern the system (eg, nutrition's effect on glucose), and, as such, constrain the model space, allowing for accurate estimation using very little data.",

        "Title": "Methodological variations in lagged regression for detecting physiologic drug effects in EHR data.",
        "Abstract": "We studied how lagged linear regression can be used to detect the physiologic effects of drugs from data in the electronic health record (EHR). We systematically examined the effect of methodological variations ((i) time series construction, (ii) temporal parameterization, (iii) intra-subject normalization, (iv) differencing (lagged rates of change achieved by taking differences between consecutive measurements), (v) explanatory variables, and (vi) regression models) on performance of lagged linear methods in this context. We generated two gold standards (one knowledge-base derived, one expert-curated) for expected pairwise relationships between 7 drugs and 4 labs, and evaluated how the 64 unique combinations of methodological perturbations reproduce the gold standards. Our 28 cohorts included patients in the Columbia University Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital clinical database, and ranged from 2820 to 79,514 patients with between 8 and 209 average time points per patient. The most accurate methods achieved AUROC of 0.794 for knowledge-base derived gold standard (95%CI [0.741, 0.847]) and 0.705 for expert-curated gold standard (95% CI [0.629, 0.781]). We observed a mean AUROC of 0.633 (95%CI [0.610, 0.657], expert-curated gold standard) across all methods that re-parameterize time according to sequence and use either a joint autoregressive model with time-series differencing or an independent lag model without differencing. The complement of this set of methods achieved a mean AUROC close to 0.5, indicating the importance of these choices. We conclude that time-series analysis of EHR data will likely rely on some of the beneficial pre-processing and modeling methodologies identified, and will certainly benefit from continued careful analysis of methodological perturbations. This study found that methodological variations, such as pre-processing and representations, have a large effect on results, exposing the importance of thoroughly evaluating these components when comparing machine-learning methods.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic health record phenotyping is the use of raw electronic health record data to assert characterizations about patients. Researchers have been doing it since the beginning of biomedical informatics, under different names. Phenotyping will benefit from an increasing focus on fidelity, both in the sense of increasing richness, such as measured levels, degree or severity, timing, probability, or conceptual relationships, and in the sense of reducing bias. Research agendas should shift from merely improving binary assignment to studying and improving richer representations. The field is actively researching new temporal directions and abstract representations, including deep learning. The field would benefit from research in nonlinear dynamics, in combining mechanistic models with empirical data, including data assimilation, and in topology. The health care process produces substantial bias, and studying that bias explicitly rather than treating it as merely another source of noise would facilitate addressing it.",

        "Abstract": "Cohort identification for clinical studies tends to be laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Developing automated or semi-automated methods for cohort identification is one of the \"holy grails\" in the field of biomedical informatics. We propose a high-throughput similarity-based cohort identification algorithm by applying numerical abstractions on Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. We implement this algorithm using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), which enables sites using this standardized EHR data representation to avail this algorithm with minimum effort for local implementation. We validate its performance for a retrospective cohort identification task on six clinical trials conducted at the Columbia University Medical Center. Our algorithm achieves an average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.966 and an average Precision at 5 of 0.983. This interoperable method promises to achieve efficient cohort identification in EHR databases. We discuss suitable applications of our method and its limitations and propose warranted future work.",

        "Title": "Personalized glucose forecasting for type 2 diabetes using data assimilation.",
        "Abstract": "Type 2 diabetes leads to premature death and reduced quality of life for 8% of Americans. Nutrition management is critical to maintaining glycemic control, yet it is difficult to achieve due to the high individual differences in glycemic response to nutrition. Anticipating glycemic impact of different meals can be challenging not only for individuals with diabetes, but also for expert diabetes educators. Personalized computational models that can accurately forecast an impact of a given meal on an individual's blood glucose levels can serve as the engine for a new generation of decision support tools for individuals with diabetes. However, to be useful in practice, these computational engines need to generate accurate forecasts based on limited datasets consistent with typical self-monitoring practices of individuals with type 2 diabetes. This paper uses three forecasting machines: (i) data assimilation, a technique borrowed from atmospheric physics and engineering that uses Bayesian modeling to infuse data with human knowledge represented in a mechanistic model, to generate real-time, personalized, adaptable glucose forecasts; (ii) model averaging of data assimilation output; and (iii) dynamical Gaussian process model regression. The proposed data assimilation machine, the primary focus of the paper, uses a modified dual unscented Kalman filter to estimate states and parameters, personalizing the mechanistic models. Model selection is used to make a personalized model selection for the individual and their measurement characteristics. The data assimilation forecasts are empirically evaluated against actual postprandial glucose measurements captured by individuals with type 2 diabetes, and against predictions generated by experienced diabetes educators after reviewing a set of historical nutritional records and glucose measurements for the same individual. The evaluation suggests that the data assimilation forecasts compare well with specific glucose measurements and match or exceed in accuracy expert forecasts. We conclude by examining ways to present predictions as forecast-derived range quantities and evaluate the comparative advantages of these ranges.",

        "Abstract": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating form of stroke. Approximately one in four patients develop progressive neurological deterioration and silent infarction referred to as delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). DCI is a complex, multifactorial secondary brain injury pattern and its pathogenesis is not fully understood. We aimed to study the relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neuronal activity at both the cortex and in scalp using electroencephalography (EEG) in poor-grade SAH patients undergoing multimodality intracranial neuromonitoring. Twenty patients were included, of whom half had DCI median 4.7 days (interquartile range (IQR): 4.0-5.6) from SAH bleed. The rate of decline in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was significant in both those with and without DCI and occurred between days 4 and 7 post-SAH. The scalp EEG alpha-delta ratio declined early in those with DCI. In the group without DCI, CBF and cortical EEG alpha-delta ratio were correlated (r\u2009=\u20090.53; p\u2009<\u2009\u20090.01) and in the group without DCI, inverse neurovascular coupling was observed at CPP\u2009<\u2009\u200980\u2009mmHg. We found preliminary evidence that as patients enter the period of highest risk for the development of DCI, the absence of neurovascular coupling may act as a possible pathomechanism in the development of ischemia following SAH.",

We wish to develop reliable high-throughput methods for identifying adverse drug effects that are easy to implement and produce readily interpretable results. To move toward this goal, we used univariate and multivariate lagged regression models to investigate associations between twenty pairs of drug orders and laboratory measurements. Multivariate lagged regression models exhibited higher sensitivity and specificity than univariate lagged regression in the 20 examples, and incorporating autoregressive terms for labs and drugs produced more robust signals in cases of known associations among the 20 example pairings. Moreover, including inpatient admission terms in the model attenuated the signals for some cases of unlikely associations, demonstrating how multivariate lagged regression models' explicit handling of context-based variables can provide a simple way to probe for health-care processes that confound analyses of EHR data.",

        "Abstract": "High frequency physiologic data are routinely generated for intensive care patients. While massive amounts of data make it difficult for clinicians to extract meaningful signals, these data could provide insight into the state of critically ill patients and guide interventions. We develop uniquely customized computational methods to uncover the causal structure within systemic and brain physiologic measures recorded in a neurological intensive care unit after subarachnoid hemorrhage. While the data have many missing values, poor signal-to-noise ratio, and are composed from a heterogeneous patient population, our advanced imputation and causal inference techniques enable physiologic models to be learned for individuals. Our analyses confirm that complex physiologic relationships including demand and supply of oxygen underlie brain oxygen measurements and that mechanisms for brain swelling early after injury may differ from those that develop in a delayed fashion. These inference methods will enable wider use of ICU data to understand patient physiology.",

        "Abstract": "There is accumulating evidence that supports the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, it is plausible that a multi-targeted therapeutic approach may be a more effective strategy to retard or even potentially halt the progression of the disease. Taurine is an organic acid that has a role in the regulation of oxidative stress and promoting mitochondrial normal functions, and N-Acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a well-known anti-oxidant and glutathione precursor. The main purpose of this study was to examine the cytoprotective effects of taurine alone or in combination with NAC against rotenone-induced toxicity in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. Taurine treatment produced a concentration-dependent reduction in rotenone-induced cell death. From this, we tested sub-effective concentrations of taurine in combination with low, sub-effective concentrations of NAC against rotenone toxicity, and found the combined treatment afforded greater cytoprotection than either treatment alone. The combined taurine/NAC treatment also attenuated rotenone-induced reductions in aconitase activity suggesting the cytoprotection afforded by the combined treatment may be associated with anti-oxidative mechanisms. Together, our data suggest that a multi-targeted approach may yield new avenues of research exploring the utility of combining therapeutic agents with different mechanisms of actions at concentrations lower than previously tested and shown to be cytoprotective.",

The analysis is based on the EHR data comprising almost two decades of clinical observations collected at New York-Presbyterian, a large hospital in New York City with one of the oldest electronic health records in the United States. Our survival analysis approach centers around Bayesian multiresolution hazard modeling, with an objective to capture the changing hazard of CKD over time, adjusted for patient clinical covariates and kidney-related laboratory tests. Special attention is paid to statistical issues common to all EHR data, such as cohort definition, missing data and censoring, variable selection, and potential for joint survival and longitudinal modeling, all of which are discussed alone and within the EHR CKD context.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic health record (EHR) data show promise for deriving new ways of modeling human disease states. Although EHR researchers often use numerical values of laboratory tests as features in disease models, a great deal of information is contained in the context within which a laboratory test is taken. For example, the same numerical value of a creatinine test has different interpretation for a chronic kidney disease patient and a patient with acute kidney injury. We study whether EHR research studies are subject to biased results and interpretations if laboratory measurements taken in different contexts are not explicitly separated. We show that the context of a laboratory test measurement can often be captured by the way the test is measured through time. We perform three tasks to study the properties of these temporal measurement patterns. In the first task, we confirm that laboratory test measurement patterns provide additional information to the stand-alone numerical value. The second task identifies three measurement pattern motifs across a set of 70 laboratory tests performed for over 14,000 patients. Of these, one motif exhibits properties that can lead to biased research results. In the third task, we demonstrate the potential for biased results on a specific example. We conduct an association study of lipase test values to acute pancreatitis. We observe a diluted signal when using only a lipase value threshold, whereas the full association is recovered when properly accounting for lipase measurements in different contexts (leveraging the lipase measurement patterns to separate the contexts). Aggregating EHR data without separating distinct laboratory test measurement patterns can intermix patients with different diseases, leading to the confounding of signals in large-scale EHR analyses. This paper presents a methodology for leveraging measurement frequency to identify and reduce laboratory test biases.",

We present a data assimilation framework for combining sparse measurements of the glucose regulatory system, available in the intensive care unit setting, with a nonlinear computational model to estimate unmeasured variables and unknown parameters. We also demonstrate a method for choosing the best variables for measurement. We anticipate that this framework will improve glucose maintenance therapies and shed light on the underlying biophysical process.",

        "Abstract": "Cationic hydroxyethyl cellulose (cHEC) was supplemented in a high-fat diet to determine if this new soluble fiber had an effect on hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia associated with cardiovascular disease using Golden Syrian hamster as an animal model. Supplementation of 3-5% cHEC in a high-fat diet for 4 weeks led to significant weight gain reduction in hamsters. In addition, significant decreases in adipose and liver weights, concentrations of plasma total, VLDL, and LDL cholesterol, and hepatic lipids were shown. No significant improvements in glucose and insulin levels were observed with cHEC; however, a significant increase in plasma adiponectin and a decrease in leptin were observed. As compared with controls, 8% cHEC-fed hamsters had greater levels of mRNA for CYP7A1 (cytochrome P450 7A1; 2-fold of control; P < 0.05), CYP51 (lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase; 6-fold of control; P < 0.05), and LDLR (LDL receptor; 1.5-fold of control) in the liver. These findings suggest the possibility of the use of cHEC for cholesterol reduction and beneficial effects on the cardiovascular risk factors.",

        "Abstract": "In animal studies, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) intake results in increased fecal fat excretion; however, the effects on dietary saturated fatty acids (SATs) and trans-fatty acids (TRANS) remain unknown. This study investigated the effect of HPMC on digestion and absorption of lipids in male Golden Syrian hamsters fed either freeze-dried ground pizza (PZ), pound cake (PC), or hamburger and fries (BF) supplemented with dietary fiber from either HPMC or microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) for 3 weeks. We observed greater excretion of SATs and TRANS by both diets supplemented with HPMC or MCC as compared to the feed. SAT, TRANS, and unsaturated fatty acids (UNSAT) contents of feces of the PZ diet supplemented with HPMC were 5-8 times higher than diets supplemented with MCC and tended to be higher in the PC- and BF-HPMC supplemented diets as well. We also observed significant increases in fecal excretion of bile acids (2.6-3-fold; P < 0.05), sterols (1.1-1.5-fold; P < 0.05), and unsaturated fatty acids (UNSAT, 1.7-4.5-fold; P < 0.05). The animal body weight gain was inversely correlated with the excretion of fecal lipid concentrations of bile acids (r = -0.56; P < 0.005), sterols (r = -0.48; P < 0.005), SAT (r = -0.69; P < 0.005), UNSAT (r = -0.67; P < 0.005), and TRANS (r = -0.62; P < 0.005). Therefore, HPMC may be facilitating fat excretion in a biased manner with preferential fecal excretion of both TRANS and SAT in hamsters fed fast food diets.",

        "Title": "Quantification and characterization of maize lipid transfer protein, a food allergen, by liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and mass spectrometric detection.",
        "Abstract": "Maize (Zea mays) is not considered a major allergenic food; however, when food induced allergenic and immunologic reactions have been implicated to maize, lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) have been identified as major allergens. LTP is an extremely stable protein that is resistant to both proteolytic attack and food processing, which permits the allergen to reach the gastrointestinal immune system in an immunogenic and allergenic conformation, allowing sensitization and induction of systemic symptoms. They are considered a complete food allergen in that they are capable of inducing specific IgE as well as eliciting severe symptoms. We have purified and characterized an endogenous ~9 kDa LTP from maize kernels. The maize LTP consists of 93 amino acid residues and has a M(r) of 9046.1 Da, determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Following accurate identification and characterization of maize LTP, a highly specific and quantitative assay using liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and mass spectrometric detection was developed. The present assay enables determination of LTP over a concentration range from 29 to 1030 \u03bcg/g in maize kernel samples. Assay recovery (percent relative error, % RE) was measured at 11 different concentrations ranging from 4 to 147 \u03bcg/mL and did not exceed 5.1%. The precision (percent coefficient of variation, % CV) was measured at 3 concentrations on each of 4 days and did not exceed 14.4%. The method was applied to evaluate the levels of LTP in 14 different maize lines. To our knowledge, this represents the first quantitative liquid chromatography-ultraviolet/mass spectrometry (LC-UV/MS) assay for the determination of LTP for the assessment of a food allergen.",

        "Title": "Hypocholesterolemic effects of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose are mediated by altered gene expression in hepatic bile and cholesterol pathways of male hamsters.",
        "Abstract": "Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), a semisynthetic, nonfermentable soluble dietary fiber, is not absorbed by the body, but its presence in the intestinal lumen increases fecal fat, sterol, and bile acid excretions and decreases intestinal cholesterol absorption, all of which may indirectly affect hepatic lipid metabolism. We measured the expression of hepatic genes involved in cholesterol, bile acid, and fatty acid metabolism in hamsters fed diets containing 39% of energy as fat and 5% of weight as HPMC or microcrystalline cellulose (control) for 4 wk. HPMC-fed hamsters gained significantly less body weight than the control group but did not differ in food intake. They had significantly lower plasma triglyceride and total-, VLDL-, HDL-, and LDL-cholesterol concentrations and hepatic total lipid, total and free cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations than controls. Compared with controls, HPMC-fed hamsters had greater levels of mRNA for CYP7A1 (cytochrome P450 7A1; 8-fold of control; P < 0.05), CYP51 (lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase; 5.3-fold of control; P < 0.05), and HMG-CoAR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase; 1.8-fold of control; P < 0.05). The plasma total cholesterol concentrations from both the control and HPMC groups were inversely correlated with expression of hepatic CYP7A1 (r = -0.54; P < 0.05), CYP51 (r = -0.79; P < 0.005), and HMG-CoAR (r = -0.75; P < 0.005) genes. This suggests that HPMC supplementation affected both cholesterol and bile acid synthesis. Our data confirm that altered hepatic expression of lipid metabolism-related genes, possibly due to modulation of fecal bile acid excretion and intestinal cholesterol absorption, contributes to the lipid-lowering effects of HPMC.",

        "Abstract": "The molecular determinants of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling in mammalian cells and, in particular, those of the CNS are unclear. Here we report that primary cortical astrocyte cultures are highly responsive to both Shh protein and Hh Agonist 1.6, a selective, small molecule Smoothened agonist. Both agonists produced increases in mRNA expression of Shh-regulated gene targets, Gli-1 and Patched in a cyclopamine- and forskolin-sensitive manner. Using this model we show for the first time that Shh pathway activation mediates rapid increases in p38 MAPK phosphorylation, without altering phosphorylation of either extracellular-signal-regulated kinases or c-jun N-terminal kinases. Selective inhibition of p38 MAPK significantly attenuated Shh-dependent up-regulation of Gli-1, inter-alpha trypsin inhibitor and thrombomodulin mRNA, however did not affect expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 or a novel Shh target, membrane-associated guanylate kinase p55 subfamily member 6. Using RNAi and a constitutively-active mutant we show that Shh signaling to p38 MAPK and subsequent Gli-1 transcription requires G-protein receptor kinase 2. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for a central role of G-protein receptor kinase 2-dependent p38 MAPK activity in regulating Shh-mediated gene transcription in astrocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Proteomic analysis can be hampered by the large concentration distribution of proteins. Immunoaffinity techniques have been applied to selectively remove high abundant proteins (HAP's) from samples prior to analysis. Although immunodepletion of HAP's has been shown to enable greater detection of low abundance proteins, the resulting fractions are often diluted 5-10-fold during the process. Various concentration techniques can be applied; however, many are incompatible with the high salt content of the fractions. To help overcome this limitation, a two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) method was developed which couples an IgY immunodepletion column in the first dimension with a large pore C18 analytical column in the second. A protein trap cartridge serves as an injection loop between the columns to facilitate on-line concentration and desalting. Feasibility of this 2D-LC system was demonstrated for mammalian proteomics. Beyond depletion of interfering proteins, this instrumentation provides four advantages which make immunodepletion technology more convenient, including: (1) on-line desalting (2) automatic buffer exchange (3) facile concentration and (4) fractionation by polarity.",

        "Abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteolytic enzymes capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix. Recent evidence has implicated MMPs in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this study, we investigated the involvement of MMP-9 (gelatinase B) in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease using zymography, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis. The activity of MMP-9 was upregulated at 3 h after MPTP injection in the striatum and after 24 h in the substantia nigra. Although MMP-9 expression decreased in the striatum by 72 h, it remained elevated in the substantia nigra compared to controls up to 7 d after MPTP administration. Immunohistochemistry showed that neurons and microglia are the source of MMP-9 expression after MPTP administration to mice. Treatment with a hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitor, Ro 28-2653 significantly reduced dopamine depletion and loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. MMP-9 expression as measured via zymography in the substantia nigra was reduced by the MMP inhibitor. These results indicate that MMP-9 is induced after MPTP application in mice and that pharmacologic inhibition of MMPs protects against MPTP neurotoxicity.",

        "Abstract": "We determined the levels and tissue localization of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as well as their endogenous tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) in postmortem brain tissue from 13 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and 8 age-matched controls. MMP-9 expression was significantly increased in both the frontal cortex (p = 0.002) and substantia nigra (p = 0.003) of PSP cases as compared to controls whereas MMP-1 levels were increased in the substantia nigra (p = 0.01) but unchanged in the frontal cortex (p = 0.41). Levels of the endogenous tissue inhibitors of MMPs, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were significantly elevated in the substantia nigra (TIMP-1: p = 0.004, TIMP-2: p = 0.01). Levels of TIMPs were unchanged in PSP frontal cortex as compared to control cases. Together, these data show alterations of MMPs and TIMPs in the substantia nigra as well as in the frontal cortex of PSP, consistent with the possibility that alterations in MMPs/TIMPs may contribute to disease pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Minocycline has been shown previously to have beneficial effects against ischemia in rats as well as neuroprotective properties against excitotoxic damage in vitro, nigral cell loss via 6-hydroxydopamine, and to prolong the life-span of transgenic mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We investigated whether minocycline would protect against toxic effects of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a toxin that selectively destroys nigrostriatal dopaminergic (DA) neurons and produces a clinical state similar to Parkinson's disease (PD) in rodents and primates. We found that although minocycline inhibited microglial activation, it significantly exacerbated MPTP-induced damage to DA neurons. We present evidence suggesting that this effect may be due to inhibition of DA and 1-methyl-4-phenylpridium (MPP+) uptake into striatal vesicles.",

        "Abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may play a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). MMP-9 and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are elevated in postmortem brain tissue of AD patients. MMPs and TIMPs are found in neurons, microglia, vascular endothelial cells and leukocytes. The aim of this study was to determine whether circulating levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 are elevated in the plasma of AD patients. We compared AD patients to age- and gender-matched controls as well as to Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. There was constitutive expression of gelatinase A (MMP-2), and gelatinase B (MMP-9), in all the samples as shown by zymographic analysis. Levels of MMP-9 were significantly (P=0.003) elevated in the plasma of AD patients as compared to controls. Plasma levels of MMP-2, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were unchanged. There were no significant changes of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 levels in PD and ALS samples. TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were significantly correlated with MMP-9 in the AD patients. ApoE genotyping of plasma samples showed that levels of MMP-2, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 and MMP-9 were not significantly different between the ApoE subgroups. These findings indicate that circulating levels of MMP-9 are increased in AD and may contribute to disease pathology.",

        "Abstract": "Microglial activation was investigated in the brains of young (3 months old) and older (9-12 months old) mice following administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neuronal loss differed significantly between young and older mice. Importantly, the two groups clearly demonstrated a distinct microglial activation pattern. In young mice which showed TH neuronal loss at 1 day (33.4%), 3 days (45.1%), 7 days (47.1%) and 14 days (46.9%), microglial activation was first observed at 1 day, with lesser activation at 3 days and none shown later than 7 days. In contrast, in older mice which showed TH neuronal loss at 1 day (49.6%), 3 days (56.1%), 7 days (71.7%) and 14 days (72.1%), microglial activation occurred at 1 day, further intensified at 3-7 days, and was largely abated by 14 days. The double immunohistochemistry further demonstrated that the activated microglia surrounded dopaminergic neurons in older mice at 7 days, which was sharply in contrast to the young mice which were devoid of massive microglial activation in the SN later than 3 days after MPTP treatment. The present study suggests that age-related microglial activation in the SN may be relevant to the higher susceptibility to MPTP neurotoxicity in older mice.",

        "Abstract": "We investigated the levels and tissue localization of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in postmortem brain tissue from Parkinson's disease (PD) and age-matched control cases. Using zymography, we found reduced MMP-2 levels in PD cases in the substantia nigra as compared to controls; levels of MMP-2 were not significantly changed in the cortex and the hippocampus. MMP-9 levels were unchanged in the investigated brain regions. Immunohistochemically, MMP-2 was localized primarily in astrocytes and microglia cells, whereas MMP-9 was predominantly neuronal. Levels of TIMP-1, an endogenous tissue inhibitor of MMPs, were significantly elevated in the substantia nigra, but not in the cortex and hippocampus. TIMP-2 levels were unchanged in PD. To investigate whether increased TIMP-1 levels in the substantia nigra might be due to increased MMP-1 expression, we measured MMP-1 levels using Western blots. MMP-1 levels were unchanged in PD cases compared to controls. Together, these data show alterations of MMP-2 and TIMP-1 in the substantia nigra of PD, consistent with the possibility that alterations in MMPs/TIMPs may contribute to disease pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Increased oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction have been suggested to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) yet the specific intracellular defects which cause and can result from these oxidative and bioenergetic defects remain unclear. To extend our previous PSP cybrid findings, we measured electron transport chain (ETC) activities in cell lines expressing mitochondrial genes from patients with PSP. Further, we measured changes in mitochondrial membrane potential as well as lipid peroxidation in PSP and control cybrids in response to mitochondrial toxins. We observed significant decreases in complex I+III activity in PSP cybrids as well as significant increases in markers of lipid oxidative damage as compared to control cybrids. These results coupled with previous reports from this and other laboratories strongly suggest contributory roles of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage in PSP, possibly due to genetic abnormalities and/or damage of mitochondrial DNA.",

        "Abstract": "Recent evidence implicates oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Thus, we undertook a study of the activity and localization of two essential antioxidant systems (superoxide dismutase [SOD] enzymes and total glutathione) in the human post-mortem PSP and control brain. Marked increases in SOD1 (Cu/ZnSOD) activity and glutathione levels were measured within most PSP brain regions examined, whereas, only the subthalamic nucleus exhibited a significant increase (+68%) in SOD2 (MnSOD) activity. Two additional cases with mild pathological abnormalities were studied. The first (case A) may represent an example of an asymptomatic PSP case, while the second (case B) had mild pathological abnormalities consistent with typical PSP. In case A, only the STN had elevated levels of SOD activity, in the absence of an increase in tissue glutathione content. In case B, SOD activities and tissue glutathione content were elevated in several regions. Immunolocalization of the SOD1 and SOD2 proteins in paraffin-embedded tissue sections revealed a marked increase in the density of SOD immunopositive profiles (particularly glia) in the typical PSP brain, particularly within the white matter. Together, our data argues strongly in favor of the involvement of oxidative stress in the etiology and progression of PSP, and suggests that deficit in SOD or glutathione metabolism are not causative.",

        "Abstract": "A progressive impairment of mitochondrial function has been suggested to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to number of deleterious consequences including impaired calcium buffering, generation of free radicals, activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and secondary excitotoxicity. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by the appearance of supranuclear gaze palsy and extrapyramidal symptoms [Arch. Neurol. 10 (1964) 333]. Although the etiological basis of PSP is unknown, compelling evidence from spectroscopy studies in PSP patients, biochemical studies in post-mortem PSP brain tissue and PSP cybrids has emerged that supports a contributory role of bio-energetic defects in the pathogenesis of PSP.",
