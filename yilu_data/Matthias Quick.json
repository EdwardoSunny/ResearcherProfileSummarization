        "Abstract": "Multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites have emerged in Cambodia and neighboring countries in Southeast Asia, compromising the efficacy of first-line antimalarial combinations. Dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine (PPQ) treatment failure rates have risen to as high as 50% in some areas in this region. For PPQ, resistance is driven primarily by a series of mutant alleles of the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT). PPQ resistance was reported in China three decades earlier, but the molecular driver remained unknown. Herein, we identify a PPQ-resistant pfcrt allele (China C) from Yunnan Province, China, whose genotypic lineage is distinct from the PPQ-resistant pfcrt alleles currently observed in Cambodia. Combining gene editing and competitive growth assays, we report that PfCRT China C confers moderate PPQ resistance while re-sensitizing parasites to chloroquine (CQ) and incurring a fitness cost that manifests as a reduced rate of parasite growth. PPQ transport assays using purified PfCRT isoforms, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, highlight differences in drug transport kinetics and in this transporter's central cavity conformation between China C and the current Southeast Asian PPQ-resistant isoforms. We also report a novel computational model that incorporates empirically determined fitness landscapes at varying drug concentrations, combined with antimalarial susceptibility profiles, mutation rates, and drug pharmacokinetics. Our simulations with PPQ-resistant or -sensitive parasite lines predict that a three-day regimen of PPQ combined with CQ can effectively clear infections and prevent the evolution of PfCRT variants. This work suggests that including CQ in combination therapies could be effective in suppressing the evolution of PfCRT-mediated multidrug resistance in regions where PPQ has lost efficacy.",

        "Abstract": "Remodeling of the microenvironment by tumor cells can activate pathways that favor cancer growth. Molecular delineation and targeting of such malignant-cell nonautonomous pathways may help overcome resistance to targeted therapies. Herein we leverage genetic mouse models, patient-derived xenografts, and patient samples to show that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exploits peripheral serotonin signaling to remodel the endosteal niche to its advantage. AML progression requires the presence of serotonin receptor 1B (HTR1B) in osteoblasts and is driven by AML-secreted kynurenine, which acts as an oncometabolite and HTR1B ligand. AML cells utilize kynurenine to induce a proinflammatory state in osteoblasts that, through the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA), acts in a positive feedback loop on leukemia cells by increasing expression of IDO1-the rate-limiting enzyme for kynurenine synthesis-thereby enabling AML progression. This leukemia-osteoblast cross-talk, conferred by the kynurenine-HTR1B-SAA-IDO1 axis, could be exploited as a niche-focused therapeutic approach against AML, opening new avenues for cancer treatment.",

        "Abstract": "The neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) homolog LeuT from Aquifex aeolicus has proven to be a valuable model for studying the transport mechanism of the NSS family. Crystal structures have captured LeuT in key conformations visited during the transport cycle, allowing for the construction of a nearly complete model of transport, with much of the conformational dynamics studied by computational simulations. Here, we report crystal structures of LeuT representing new intermediate conformations between the outward-facing open and occluded states. These structures, combined with binding and accessibility studies, reveal details of conformational dynamics that can follow substrate binding at the central substrate binding site (S1) of LeuT in outward-facing states, suggesting a potential competition for direction between the outward-open and outward-occluded states at this stage during substrate transport. Our structures further support an intimate interplay between the protonation state of Glu290 and binding of Na1 that may ultimately regulate the outward-open-to-occluded transition.",

Insulin-secreting pancreatic \u03b2-cells express the machinery for DA synthesis and catabolism, as well as all five DA receptors. In these cells, DA functions as a negative regulator of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), which is mediated by DA D",

        "Title": "Amphetamine enantiomers inhibit homomeric \u03b17 nicotinic receptor through a competitive mechanism and within the intoxication levels in humans.",
        "Abstract": "Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) are the second most consumed illicit drug worldwide and lack good treatments for associated substance use disorders, lagging behind other addictive drugs. For this reason, a deeper understanding of the pharmacodynamics of ATS is required. The present study seeks to determine amphetamine (AMPH) enantiomers' effects on the homomeric \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17 nAChR). Here we have shown that AMPH enantiomers bind to the \u03b17 nAChR and competitively inhibit acetylcholine responses. Our in silico docking analysis suggests that AMPH binds close to the \u03b27 strand of the B-loop of a chimera comprising of the human \u03b17 nAChR and the acetylcholine binding protein from Lymnaea stagnalis. This may inhibit the required movement of the C-loop for channel opening, due to steric hindrance, providing a structural mechanism for its antagonist effect. Finally, we have shown that, in \u03b17 nAChR full knockout mice, the behavioral response to D-AMPH is attenuated, providing direct evidence for the role of \u03b17 nAChRs on the physiological response to D-AMPH. Importantly, D-AMPH exerts these effects at concentrations predicted to be pharmacologically relevant for chronic methamphetamine users and during binges. In conclusion, our data present new findings that implicate the \u03b17 nAChR on the pharmacodynamics of ATS, which may be important for behavioral responses to these drugs, indicating a potential role for \u03b17 nAChRs in ATS substance-use disorders.",

        "Title": "Structural mechanism of ligand activation in human calcium-sensing receptor.",
        "Abstract": "Human calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that maintains extracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis through the regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion. It functions as a disulfide-tethered homodimer composed of three main domains, the Venus Flytrap module, cysteine-rich domain, and seven-helix transmembrane region. Here, we present the crystal structures of the entire extracellular domain of CaSR in the resting and active conformations. We provide direct evidence that L-amino acids are agonists of the receptor. In the active structure, L-Trp occupies the orthosteric agonist-binding site at the interdomain cleft and is primarily responsible for inducing extracellular domain closure to initiate receptor activation. Our structures reveal multiple binding sites for Ca(2+) and PO4(3-) ions. Both ions are crucial for structural integrity of the receptor. While Ca(2+) ions stabilize the active state, PO4(3-) ions reinforce the inactive conformation. The activation mechanism of CaSR involves the formation of a novel dimer interface between subunits.",

        "Abstract": "The phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems are found in bacteria, where they play central roles in sugar uptake and regulation of cellular uptake processes. Little is known about how the membrane-embedded components (EIICs) selectively mediate the passage of carbohydrates across the membrane. Here we report the functional characterization and 2.55-\u00c5 resolution structure of a\u00a0maltose transporter, bcMalT, belonging to the glucose superfamily of EIIC transporters. bcMalT crystallized in an outward-facing occluded conformation, in contrast to the structure of another glucose superfamily EIIC, bcChbC, which crystallized in an inward-facing occluded conformation. The structures differ in the position of a structurally conserved substrate-binding domain that is suggested to play a central role in sugar transport. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations suggest a potential pathway for substrate entry from the periplasm into the bcMalT substrate-binding site. These results provide a mechanistic framework for understanding substrate recognition and translocation for the glucose superfamily EIIC transporters.",

        "Title": "Role of Annular Lipids in the Functional Properties of Leucine Transporter LeuT Proteomicelles.",
        "Abstract": "Recent work has shown that the choice of the type and concentration of detergent used for the solubilization of membrane proteins can strongly influence the results of functional experiments. In particular, the amino acid transporter LeuT can bind two substrate molecules in low concentrations of n-dodecyl \u03b2-d-maltopyranoside (DDM), whereas high concentrations reduce the molar binding stoichiometry to 1:1. Subsequent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of LeuT in DDM proteomicelles revealed that DDM can penetrate to the extracellular vestibule and make stable contacts in the functionally important secondary substrate binding site (S2), suggesting a potential competitive mechanism for the reduction in binding stoichiometry. Because annular lipids can be retained during solubilization, we performed MD simulations of LeuT proteomicelles at various stages of the solubilization process. We find that at low DDM concentrations, lipids are retained around the protein and penetration of detergent into the S2 site does not occur, whereas at high concentrations, lipids are displaced and the probability of DDM binding in the S2 site is increased. This behavior is dependent on the type of detergent, however, as we find in the simulations that the detergent lauryl maltose-neopentyl glycol, which is approximately twice the size of DDM and structurally more closely resembles lipids, does not penetrate the protein even at very high concentrations. We present functional studies that confirm the computational findings, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of experimental conditions, and for cautious interpretation of data in gathering mechanistic information about membrane proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs) mediate reuptake of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft and are targets for several therapeutics and psychostimulants. The prokaryotic NSS homologue, LeuT, represents a principal structural model for Na(+)-coupled transport catalyzed by these proteins. Here, we used site-directed fluorescence quenching spectroscopy to identify in LeuT a substrate-induced conformational rearrangement at the inner gate conceivably leading to formation of a structural intermediate preceding transition to the inward-open conformation. The substrate-induced, Na(+)-dependent change required an intact primary substrate-binding site and involved increased water exposure of the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 5. The findings were supported by simulations predicting disruption of an intracellular interaction network leading to a discrete rotation of transmembrane segment 5 and the adjacent intracellular loop 2. The magnitude of the spectroscopic response correlated inversely with the transport rate for different substrates, suggesting that stability of the intermediate represents an unrecognized rate-limiting barrier in the NSS transport mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "The enantiomerically and diastereomerically pure tricyclic oxazolidine cis-10 was prepared in a five step synthesis starting with 1-bromo-2-iodobenzene. Me3SiCN and allylSiMe3 reacted with cis-10 in the presence of TiCl4 to form the nitrile (3S)-11 and the allyl derivative (3S)-12 with high diastereoselectivity. The hydrogenolytic removal of the chiral auxiliary failed, since the endocyclic benzyl-N-bond was cleaved simultaneously. Therefore the N-(hydroxyethyl)amide of (3S)-12 was transformed into the enamide 27, which was hydrolyzed to afford the secondary amide 28. The enamide strategy to remove the chiral auxiliary from (3S)-11 led to complete racemization due to fast deprotonation in \u03b1-position of the cyano moiety. Two pairs of enantiomers 30a-b/ent-30a-b with prototypical \u03c3 substituents at the N-atom were prepared. The low \u03c31 affinity of the tetrahydro-2-benzazepines (ent-30b, Ki = 407 nM) is attributed to the short distance between the two lipophilic aromatic moieties.",

        "Title": "Beyond non-integer Hill coefficients: A novel approach to analyzing binding data, applied to Na+-driven transporters.",
        "Abstract": "Prokaryotic and eukaryotic Na(+)-driven transporters couple the movement of one or more Na(+) ions down their electrochemical gradient to the active transport of a variety of solutes. When more than one Na(+) is involved, Na(+)-binding data are usually analyzed using the Hill equation with a non-integer exponent n. The results of this analysis are an overall Kd-like constant equal to the concentration of ligand that produces half saturation and n, a measure of cooperativity. This information is usually insufficient to provide the basis for mechanistic models. In the case of transport using two Na(+) ions, an n < 2 indicates that molecules with only one of the two sites occupied are present at low saturation. Here, we propose a new way of analyzing Na(+)-binding data for the case of two Na(+) ions that, by taking into account binding to individual sites, provides far more information than can be obtained by using the Hill equation with a non-integer coefficient: it yields pairs of possible values for the Na(+) affinities of the individual sites that can only vary within narrowly bounded ranges. To illustrate the advantages of the method, we present experimental scintillation proximity assay (SPA) data on binding of Na(+) to the Na(+)/I(-) symporter (NIS). SPA is a method widely used to study the binding of Na(+) to Na(+)-driven transporters. NIS is the key plasma membrane protein that mediates active I(-) transport in the thyroid gland, the first step in the biosynthesis of the thyroid hormones, of which iodine is an essential constituent. NIS activity is electrogenic, with a 2:1 Na(+)/I(-) transport stoichiometry. The formalism proposed here is general and can be used to analyze data on other proteins with two binding sites for the same substrate.",

        "Abstract": "The human Na(+)/multivitamin transporter (hSMVT) has been suggested to transport \u03b1-lipoic acid (LA), a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent used in therapeutic applications, e.g. in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and Alzheimer disease. However, the molecular basis of the cellular delivery of LA and in particular the stereospecificity of the transport process are not well understood. Here, we expressed recombinant hSMVT in Pichia pastoris and used affinity chromatography to purify the detergent-solubilized protein followed by reconstitution of hSMVT in lipid bilayers. Using a combined approach encompassing radiolabeled LA transport and equilibrium binding studies in conjunction with the stabilized R-(+)- and S-(-)-enantiomers and the R,S-(+/-) racemic mixture of LA or lipoamide, we identified the biologically active form of LA, R-LA, to be the physiological substrate of hSMVT. Interaction of R-LA with hSMVT is strictly dependent on Na(+). Under equilibrium conditions, hSMVT can simultaneously bind ~2 molecules of R-LA in a biphasic binding isotherm with dissociation constants (Kd) of 0.9 and 7.4 \u03bcm. Transport of R-LA in the oocyte and reconstituted system is exclusively dependent on Na(+) and exhibits an affinity of ~3 \u03bcm. Measuring transport with known amounts of protein in proteoliposomes containing hSMVT in outside-out orientation yielded a catalytic turnover number (kcat) of about 1 s(-1), a value that is well in agreement with other Na(+)-coupled transporters. Our data suggest that hSMVT-mediated transport is highly specific for R-LA at our tested concentration range, a finding with wide ramifications for the use of LA in therapeutic applications.",

        "Title": "Mechanism of the Association between Na+ Binding and Conformations at the Intracellular Gate in Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporters.",
        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs) terminate neurotransmission by Na(+)-dependent reuptake of released neurotransmitters. Previous studies suggested that Na(+)-binding reconfigures dynamically coupled structural elements in an allosteric interaction network (AIN) responsible for function-related conformational changes, but the intramolecular pathway of this mechanism has remained uncharted. We describe a new approach for the modeling and analysis of intramolecular dynamics in the bacterial NSS homolog LeuT. From microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations and cognate experimental verifications in both LeuT and human dopamine transporter (hDAT), we apply the novel method to identify the composition and the dynamic properties of their conserved AIN. In LeuT, two different perturbations disrupting Na(+) binding and transport (i.e. replacing Na(+) with Li(+) or the Y268A mutation at the intracellular gate) affect the AIN in strikingly similar ways. In contrast, other mutations that affect the intracellular gate (i.e. R5A and D369A) do not significantly impair Na(+) cooperativity and transport. Our analysis shows these perturbations to have much lesser effects on the AIN, underscoring the sensitivity of this novel method to the mechanistic nature of the perturbation. Notably, this set of observations holds as well for hDAT, where the aligned Y335A, R60A, and D436A mutations also produce different impacts on Na(+) dependence. Thus, the detailed AIN generated from our method is shown to connect Na(+) binding with global conformational changes that are critical for the transport mechanism. That the AIN between the Na(+) binding sites and the intracellular gate in bacterial LeuT resembles that in eukaryotic hDAT highlights the conservation of allosteric pathways underlying NSS function.",

        "Abstract": "The Na(+)/multivitamin transporter (SMVT) is a member of the solute:sodium symporter family that catalyzes the Na(+)-dependent uptake of the structurally diverse water-soluble vitamins pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) and biotin (vitamin H), \u03b1-lipoic acid-a vitamin-like substance with strong antioxidant properties-and iodide. The organic substrates of SMVT play central roles in the cellular metabolism and are, therefore, essential for normal human health and development. For example, biotin deficiency leads to growth retardation, dermatological disorders, and neurological disorders. Animal studies have shown that biotin deficiency during pregnancy is directly correlated to embryonic growth retardation, congenital malformation, and death of the embryo. This chapter focuses on the structural and functional features of the human isoform of SMVT (hSMVT); the discovery of which was greatly facilitated by the cloning and expression of hSMVT in tractable expression systems. Special emphasis will be given to mechanistic implications of the transport process of hSMVT that will inform our understanding of the molecular determinants of hSMVT-mediated transport in dynamic context to alleviate the development and optimization of hSMVT as a multipotent platform for drug delivery.",

        "Abstract": "The structure of the sodium/galactose transporter (vSGLT), a solute-sodium symporter (SSS) from Vibrio parahaemolyticus, shares a common structural fold with LeuT of the neurotransmitter-sodium symporter family. Structural alignments between LeuT and vSGLT reveal that the crystallographically identified galactose-binding site in vSGLT is located in a more extracellular location relative to the central substrate-binding site (S1) in LeuT. Our computational analyses suggest the existence of an additional galactose-binding site in vSGLT that aligns to the S1 site of LeuT. Radiolabeled galactose saturation binding experiments indicate that, like LeuT, vSGLT can simultaneously bind two substrate molecules under equilibrium conditions. Mutating key residues in the individual substrate-binding sites reduced the molar substrate-to-protein binding stoichiometry to ~1. In addition, the related and more experimentally tractable SSS member PutP (the Na(+)/proline transporter) also exhibits a binding stoichiometry of 2. Targeting residues in the proposed sites with mutations results in the reduction of the binding stoichiometry and is accompanied by severely impaired translocation of proline. Our data suggest that substrate transport by SSS members requires both substrate-binding sites, thereby implying that SSSs and neurotransmitter-sodium symporters share common mechanistic elements in substrate transport.",

        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter/sodium symporters (NSSs) terminate synaptic signal transmission by Na+-dependent reuptake of released neurotransmitters. Key conformational states have been reported for the bacterial homolog LeuT and an inhibitor-bound Drosophila dopamine transporter. However, a coherent mechanism of Na+-driven transport has not been described. Here, we present two crystal structures of MhsT, an NSS member from Bacillus halodurans, in occluded inward-facing states with bound Na+ ions and L-tryptophan, providing insight into the cytoplasmic release of Na+. The switch from outward- to inward-oriented states is centered on the partial unwinding of transmembrane helix 5, facilitated by a conserved GlyX9Pro motif that opens an intracellular pathway for water to access the Na2 site. We propose a mechanism, based on our structural and functional findings, in which solvation through the TM5 pathway facilitates Na+ release from Na2 and the transition to an inward-open state.",

        "Abstract": "The Na(+)/proline symporter (PutP), like several other Na(+)-coupled symporters, belongs to the so-called LeuT-fold structural family, which features ten core\u00a0transmembrane domains (cTMs) connected by extra- and intracellular loops. The role of these loops has been discussed in context with the gating function in the alternating access model of secondary active transport processes. Here we report the complete spin-labeling site scan of extracellular loop 4 (eL4) in PutP that reveals the presence of two \u03b1-helical\u00a0segments, eL4a and eL4b. Among the eL4 residues that are directly implicated in the functional dynamics of the transporter, Phe314 in eL4b anchors the loop by means of hydrophobic contacts to cTM1 close to the ligand binding sites. We propose that ligand-induced conformational changes at the binding sites are transmitted via the anchoring residue to eL4 and through eL4 further to adjacent cTMs, leading to closure of the extracellular gate.",

        "Abstract": "The leucine transporter (LeuT) from Aquifex aeolicus is a bacterial homolog of neurotransmitter/sodium symporters (NSSs) that catalyze reuptake of neurotransmitters at the synapse. Crystal structures of wild-type and mutants of LeuT have been interpreted as conformational states in the coupled transport cycle. However, the mechanistic identities inferred from these structures have not been validated, and the ligand-dependent conformational equilibrium of LeuT has not been defined. Here, we used distance measurements between spin-label pairs to elucidate Na(+)- and leucine-dependent conformational changes on the intracellular and extracellular sides of the transporter. The results identify structural motifs that underlie the isomerization of LeuT between outward-facing, inward-facing and occluded states. The conformational changes reported here present a dynamic picture of the alternating-access mechanism of LeuT and NSSs that is different from the inferences reached from currently available structural models.",

        "Abstract": "Helicobacter pylori is cause of chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcer and gastric carcinoma in humans. L-proline is a preferred energy source of the microaerophilic bacterium. Previous analyses revealed that HpputP and HpputA, the genes that are predicted to play a central role in proline metabolism as they encode for the proline transporter and proline dehydrogenase, respectively, are essential for stomach colonization. Here, the molecular basis of proline transport in H. pylori by HpPutP was investigated experimentally for the first time. Measuring radiolabeled substrate transport in H. pylori and E. coli heterologously expressing HpputP as well as in proteoliposomes reconstituted with HpPutP, we demonstrate that the observed proline transport in H. pylori is mediated by HpPutP. HpPutP is specific and exhibits a high affinity for L-proline. Notably, L-proline transport is exclusively dependent on Na(+) as coupling ion, i.e., Na(+)/L-proline symport, reminiscent to the properties of PutP of E. coli even though H. pylori lives in a more acidic environment. Homology model-based structural comparisons and substitution analyses identified amino acids crucial for function. HpPutP-catalyzed proline uptake was efficiently inhibited by the known proline analogs 3,4-dehydro-D,L-proline and L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid.",

        "Title": "Structural basis of the alternating-access mechanism in a bile acid transporter.",
        "Abstract": "Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in hepatocytes and secreted through the biliary tract into the small intestine, where they aid in absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins. Through a process known as enterohepatic recirculation, more than 90% of secreted bile acids are then retrieved from the intestine and returned to the liver for resecretion. In humans, there are two Na(+)-dependent bile acid transporters involved in enterohepatic recirculation, the Na(+)-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP; also known as SLC10A1) expressed in hepatocytes, and the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT; also known as SLC10A2) expressed on enterocytes in the terminal ileum. In recent years, ASBT has attracted much interest as a potential drug target for treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, because inhibition of ASBT reduces reabsorption of bile acids, thus increasing bile acid synthesis and consequently cholesterol consumption. However, a lack of three-dimensional structures of bile acid transporters hampers our ability to understand the molecular mechanisms of substrate selectivity and transport, and to interpret the wealth of existing functional data. The crystal structure of an ASBT homologue from Neisseria meningitidis (ASBT(NM)) in detergent was reported recently, showing the protein in an inward-open conformation bound to two Na(+) and a taurocholic acid. However, the structural changes that bring bile acid and Na(+) across the membrane are difficult to infer from a single structure. To understand the structural changes associated with the coupled transport of Na(+) and bile acids, here we solved two structures of an ASBT homologue from Yersinia frederiksenii (ASBTYf) in a lipid environment, which reveal that a large rigid-body rotation of a substrate-binding domain gives the conserved 'crossover' region, where two discontinuous helices cross each other, alternating accessibility from either side of the cell membrane. This result has implications for the location and orientation of the bile acid during transport, as well as for the translocation pathway for Na(+).",

        "Title": "The membrane protein LeuT in micellar systems: aggregation dynamics and detergent binding to the S2 site.",
        "Abstract": "Structural and functional properties of integral membrane proteins are often studied in detergent micellar environments (proteomicelles), but how such proteomicelles form and organize is not well understood. This makes it difficult to evaluate the relationship between the properties of the proteins measured in such a detergent-solubilized form and under native conditions. To obtain mechanistic information about this relationship for the leucine transporter (LeuT), a prokaryotic homologue of the mammalian neurotransmitter/sodium symporters (NSSs), we studied the properties of proteomicelles formed by n-dodecyl-\u03b2,D-maltopyranoside (DDM) detergent. Extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of different protein/detergent/water number ratios revealed the formation of a proteomicelle characterized by a constant-sized shell of detergents surrounding LeuT protecting its transmembrane segments from unfavorable hydrophobic/hydrophilic exposure. Regardless of the DDM content in the simulated system, this shell consisted of a constant number of DDM molecules (\u223c120 measured at a 4 \u00c5 cutoff distance from LeuT). In contrast, the overall number of DDMs in the proteomicelle (aggregation number) was found to depend on the detergent concentration, reaching a saturation value of 226\u00b117 DDMs in the highest concentration regime simulated. Remarkably, we found that at high detergent-to-protein ratios we observed two independent ways of DDM penetration into LeuT, both leading to a positioning of the DDM molecule in the second substrate (S2) binding site of LeuT. Consonant with several recent experimental studies demonstrating changes in functional properties of membrane proteins due to detergent, our findings highlight how the environment in which the membrane proteins are examined may affect the outcome and interpretation of their mechanistic features.",

        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs) play a critical role in signaling by reuptake of neurotransmitters. Eukaryotic NSSs are chloride-dependent, whereas prokaryotic NSS homologs like LeuT are chloride-independent but contain an acidic residue (Glu290 in LeuT) at a site where eukaryotic NSSs have a serine. The LeuT-E290S mutant displays chloride-dependent activity. We show that, in LeuT-E290S cocrystallized with bromide or chloride, the anion is coordinated by side chain hydroxyls from Tyr47, Ser290, and Thr254 and the side chain amide of Gln250. The bound anion and the nearby sodium ion in the Na1 site organize a connection between their coordinating residues and the extracellular gate of LeuT through a continuous H-bond network. The specific insights from the structures, combined with results from substrate binding studies and molecular dynamics simulations, reveal an anion-dependent occlusion mechanism for NSS and shed light on the functional role of chloride binding.",

        "Abstract": "Sodium-coupled substrate transport plays a central role in many biological processes. However, despite knowledge of the structures of several sodium-coupled transporters, the location of the sodium-binding site(s) often remains unclear. Several of these structures have the five transmembrane-helix inverted-topology repeat, LeuT-like (FIRL) fold, whose pseudosymmetry has been proposed to facilitate the alternating-access mechanism required for transport. Here, we provide biophysical, biochemical, and computational evidence for the location of the two cation-binding sites in the sodium-coupled betaine symporter BetP. A recent X-ray structure of BetP in a sodium-bound closed state revealed that one of these sites, equivalent to the Na2 site in related transporters, is located between transmembrane helices 1 and 8 of the FIRL-fold; here, we confirm the location of this site by other means. Based on the pseudosymmetry of this fold, we hypothesized that the second site is located between the equivalent helices 6 and 3. Molecular dynamics simulations of the closed-state structure suggest this second sodium site involves two threonine sidechains and a backbone carbonyl from helix 3, a phenylalanine from helix 6, and a water molecule. Mutating the residues proposed to form the two binding sites increased the apparent K(m) and K(d) for sodium, as measured by betaine uptake, tryptophan fluorescence, and (22)Na(+) binding, and also diminished the transient currents measured in proteoliposomes using solid supported membrane-based electrophysiology. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for the identity of the residues forming the sodium-binding sites in BetP.",

        "Abstract": "The Kv1 family voltage-dependent K(+) channels are essential for termination of action potentials in neurons and myocytes. These channels form a stable complex with their beta subunits (Kv\u03b2), some of which inhibit channel activity. Cortisone potentiates Kv1 channel by binding to Kv\u03b2 and promoting its dissociation from the channel, but its half-maximum effective concentration is \u223c46 \u03bcM. To identify corticosteroids that are more efficient than cortisone, we examined 25 cortisone analogues and found that fluticasone propionate potentiates channel current with a half-maximum effective concentration (EC(50)) of 37 \u00b1 1.1 nM. Further studies showed that fluticasone propionate potentiates channel current by inducing dissociation of Kv\u03b2, and docking of fluticasone propionate into the cortisone binding site reveals potential interactions that enhance the EC(50) value. Thus, fluticasone propionate provides a starting point for rational design of more efficient small-molecule compounds that increase Kv1 activity and affect the integrity of the Kv1-Kv\u03b2 complex.",

        "Abstract": "As an adaptation to infrequent access to water, terrestrial mammals produce urine that is hyperosmotic to plasma. To prevent osmotic diuresis by the large quantity of urea generated by protein catabolism, the kidney epithelia contain facilitative urea transporters (UTs) that allow rapid equilibration between the urinary space and the hyperosmotic interstitium. Here we report the first X-ray crystal structure of a mammalian UT, UT-B, at a resolution of 2.36\u00a0\u00c5. UT-B is a homotrimer and each protomer contains a urea conduction pore with a narrow selectivity filter. Structural analyses and molecular dynamics simulations showed that the selectivity filter has two urea binding sites separated by an approximately 5.0\u00a0kcal/mol energy barrier. Functional studies showed that the rate of urea conduction in UT-B is increased by hypoosmotic stress, and that the site of osmoregulation coincides with the location of the energy barrier.",

        "Abstract": "Inhibitory neurotransmission is mediated primarily by GABA. The metabotropic GABA(B) receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor central to mammalian brain function. Malfunction of GABA(B) receptor has been implicated in several neurological disorders. GABA(B) receptor functions as a heterodimeric assembly of GBR1 and GBR2 subunits, where GBR1 is responsible for ligand-binding and GBR2 is responsible for G protein coupling. Here we demonstrate that the GBR2 ectodomain directly interacts with the GBR1 ectodomain to increase agonist affinity by selectively stabilizing the agonist-bound conformation of GBR1. We present the crystal structure of the GBR2 ectodomain, which reveals a polar heterodimeric interface. We also identify specific heterodimer contacts from both subunits, and GBR1 residues involved in ligand recognition. Lastly, our structural and functional data indicate that the GBR2 ectodomain adopts a constitutively open conformation, suggesting a structural asymmetry in the active state of GABA(B) receptor that is unique to the GABAergic system.",

        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter:Na(+) symporters (NSSs), the targets of antidepressants and psychostimulants, recapture neurotransmitters from the synapse in a Na(+)-dependent symport mechanism. The crystal structure of the NSS homolog LeuT from Aquifex aeolicus revealed one leucine substrate in an occluded, centrally located (S1) binding site next to two Na(+) ions. Computational studies combined with binding and flux experiments identified a second substrate (S2) site and a molecular mechanism of Na(+)-substrate symport that depends upon the allosteric interaction of substrate molecules in the two high-affinity sites. Here we show that the S2 site, which has not yet been identified by crystallographic approaches, can be blocked during preparation of detergent-solubilized LeuT, thereby obscuring its crucial role in Na(+)-coupled symport. This finding points to the need for caution in selecting experimental environments in which the properties and mechanistic features of membrane proteins can be delineated.",

        "Abstract": "Helicobacter pylori's unique ability to colonize and survive in the acidic environment of the stomach is critically dependent on uptake of urea through the urea channel, HpUreI. Hence, HpUreI may represent a promising target for the development of specific drugs against this human pathogen. To obtain insight into the structure-function relationship of this channel, we developed conditions for the high-yield expression and purification of stable recombinant HpUreI. Detergent-solubilized HpUreI forms a homotrimer, as determined by chemical cross-linking. Urea dissociation kinetics of purified HpUreI were determined by means of the scintillation proximity assay, whereas urea efflux was measured in HpUreI-containing proteoliposomes using stopped-flow spectrometry to determine the kinetics and selectivity of the urea channel. The kinetic analyses revealed that urea conduction in HpUreI is pH-sensitive and saturable with a half-saturation concentration (or K(0.5)) of ~163 mM. The extent of binding of urea by HpUreI was increased at lower pH; however, the apparent affinity of urea binding (~150 mM) was not significantly pH-dependent. The solute selectivity analysis indicated that HpUreI is highly selective for urea and hydroxyurea. Removing either amino group of urea molecules diminishes their permeability through HpUreI. Similar to urea conduction, diffusion of water through HpUreI is pH-dependent with low water permeability at neutral pH.",

        "Abstract": "Solute:sodium symporters (SSSs) transport vital molecules across the plasma membrane of all living organisms. vSGLT, the Na(+)/galactose transporter of Vibrio parahemeolyticus, is the only SSS for which high resolution structural information is available, revealing a LeuT-like fold and a Na(+)-binding site analogous to the Na2 site of LeuT. Whereas the core transmembrane segments (TMs) of SSSs share high structural similarity with other transporters of LeuT-like fold, TM1 does not correspond to any TM in those structural homologs and was only resolved for the backbone atoms in the initial vSGLT structure (Protein Data Bank code 3DH4). To assess the role of TM1 in Na(+)-coupled substrate symport by the SSSs, here we have studied the role of a conserved residue in TM1 by computational modeling in conjunction with radiotracer transport and binding studies. Based on our sequence alignment and much topological data for homologous PutP, the Na(+)/proline transporter, we have simulated a series of vSGLT models with shifted TM1 residue assignments. We show that in two converged vSGLT models that retained the original TM1 backbone conformation, a conserved residue, Tyr-19, is associated with the Na(+) binding interaction network. In silico and in vitro mutagenesis of homologous Tyr-14 in PutP revealed the involvement of this conserved residue in Na(+)-dependent substrate binding and transport. Thus, our combined computational and experimental data provide the first clues about the importance of a conserved residue in TM1, a unique TM in the proteins with LeuT-like fold, in the Na(+)-coupled symport mechanism of SSSs.",

        "Title": "Substrate-modulated gating dynamics in a Na+-coupled neurotransmitter transporter homologue.",
        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter/Na(+) symporters (NSSs) terminate neuronal signalling by recapturing neurotransmitter released into the synapse in a co-transport (symport) mechanism driven by the Na(+) electrochemical gradient. NSSs for dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin are targeted by the psychostimulants cocaine and amphetamine, as well as by antidepressants. The crystal structure of LeuT, a prokaryotic NSS homologue, revealed an occluded conformation in which a leucine (Leu) and two Na(+) are bound deep within the protein. This structure has been the basis for extensive structural and computational exploration of the functional mechanisms of proteins with a LeuT-like fold. Subsequently, an 'outward-open' conformation was determined in the presence of the inhibitor tryptophan, and the Na(+)-dependent formation of a dynamic outward-facing intermediate was identified using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In addition, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging has been used to reveal reversible transitions to an inward-open LeuT conformation, which involve the movement of transmembrane helix TM1a away from the transmembrane helical bundle. We investigated how substrate binding is coupled to structural transitions in LeuT during Na(+)-coupled transport. Here we report a process whereby substrate binding from the extracellular side of LeuT facilitates intracellular gate opening and substrate release at the intracellular face of the protein. In the presence of alanine, a substrate that is transported \u223c10-fold faster than leucine, we observed alanine-induced dynamics in the intracellular gate region of LeuT that directly correlate with transport efficiency. Collectively, our data reveal functionally relevant and previously hidden aspects of the NSS transport mechanism that emphasize the functional importance of a second substrate (S2) binding site within the extracellular vestibule. Substrate binding in this S2 site appears to act cooperatively with the primary substrate (S1) binding site to control intracellular gating more than 30\u2009\u00c5 away, in a manner that allows the Na(+) gradient to power the transport mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "Saccharides have a central role in the nutrition of all living organisms. Whereas several saccharide uptake systems are shared between the different phylogenetic kingdoms, the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system exists almost exclusively in bacteria. This multi-component system includes an integral membrane protein EIIC that transports saccharides and assists in their phosphorylation. Here we present the crystal structure of an EIIC from Bacillus cereus that transports diacetylchitobiose. The EIIC is a homodimer, with an expansive interface formed between the amino-terminal halves of the two protomers. The carboxy-terminal half of each protomer has a large binding pocket that contains a diacetylchitobiose, which is occluded from both sides of the membrane with its site of phosphorylation near the conserved His250 and Glu334 residues. The structure shows the architecture of this important class of transporters, identifies the determinants of substrate binding and phosphorylation, and provides a framework for understanding the mechanism of sugar translocation.",

Here we present the crystal structure of a TrkH from Vibrio parahaemolyticus. TrkH is a homodimer, and each protomer contains an ion permeation pathway. A selectivity filter, similar in architecture to those of K(+) channels but significantly shorter, is lined by backbone and side-chain oxygen atoms. Functional studies showed that TrkH is selective for permeation of K(+) and Rb(+) over smaller ions such as Na(+) or Li(+). Immediately intracellular to the selectivity filter are an intramembrane loop and an arginine residue, both highly conserved, which constrict the permeation pathway. Substituting the arginine with an alanine significantly increases the rate of K(+) flux. These results reveal the molecular basis of K(+) selectivity and suggest a novel gating mechanism for this large and important family of membrane transport proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Iodide (I(-)) is an essential constituent of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and thyroxine, which are required for the development of the central nervous system in the fetus and newborn. I(-) uptake in the thyroid is mediated by the Na(+)/I(-) symporter (NIS). NIS has gained particular medical interest due to its sensitivity to the environmental pollutant perchlorate (ClO(4)(-)) and its implication in radioiodide cancer treatment. Recently, others have shown that I(-) absorption in the intestine is mediated by NIS (Nicola, J. P., Basquin, C., Portulano, C., Reyna-Neyra, A., Paroder, M., and Carrasco, N. (2009) Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 296, C654-662). However, their data suggest the participation of other systems in the homeostasis of I(-), in particular because in vivo uptake studies revealed a ClO(4)(-)-insensitive transport component. Here, we describe Na(+)-coupled I(-) uptake by the human Na(+)/multivitamin transporter (hSMVT), a related protein isolated from the placenta, where it was suggested to supply the fetus with the water-soluble vitamins biotin and pantothenic acid, and \u03b1-lipoic acid. hSMVT-mediated Na(+)/I(-) symport is inhibited by the other three organic hSMVT substrates but not by NIS substrates; notably, hSMVT is insensitive to ClO(4)(-). Because hSMVT is found in the intestine and in many other tissues, we propose that hSMVT may play an important role in the homeostasis of I(-) in the body.",

        "Abstract": "System l-amino acid transporters (LAT) belong to the amino acid, polyamine, and organic cation superfamily of transporters and include the light subunits of heteromeric amino acid transporters and prokaryotic homologues. Cysteine reactivity of SteT (serine/threonine antiporter) has been used here to study the substrate-binding site of LAT transporters. Residue Cys-291, in transmembrane domain 8 (TM8), is inactivated by thiol reagents in a substrate protectable manner. Surprisingly, DTT activated the transporter by reducing residue Cys-291. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of TM8 showed DTT activation in the single-cysteine mutants S287C, G294C, and S298C, lining the same alpha-helical face. S-Thiolation in Escherichia coli cells resulted in complete inactivation of the single-cysteine mutant G294C. l-Serine blocked DTT activation with an EC(50) similar to the apparent K(M) of this mutant. Thus, S-thiolation abolished substrate translocation but not substrate binding. Mutation of Lys-295, to Cys (K295C) broadened the profile of inhibitors and the spectrum of substrates with the exception of imino acids. A structural model of SteT based on the structural homologue AdiC (arginine/agmatine antiporter) positions residues Cys-291 and Lys-295 in the putative substrate binding pocket. All this suggests that Lys-295 is a main determinant in the recognition of the side chain of SteT substrates. In contrast, Gly-294 is not facing the surface, suggesting conformational changes involving TM8 during the transport cycle. Our results suggest that TM8 sculpts the substrate-binding site and undergoes conformational changes during the transport cycle of SteT.",

        "Abstract": "Crystallographic, computational and functional analyses of LeuT have revealed details of the molecular architecture of Na(+)-coupled transporters and the mechanistic nature of ion/substrate coupling, but the conformational changes that support a functional transport cycle have yet to be described fully. We have used site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis to capture the dynamics of LeuT in the region of the extracellular vestibule associated with the binding of Na(+) and leucine. The results outline the Na(+)-dependent formation of a dynamic outward-facing intermediate that exposes the primary substrate binding site and the conformational changes that occlude this binding site upon subsequent binding of the leucine substrate. Furthermore, the binding of the transport inhibitors tryptophan, clomipramine and octyl-glucoside is shown to induce structural changes that distinguish the resulting inhibited conformation from the Na(+)/leucine-bound state.",

        "Title": "Structure-function studies of the SLC17 transporter sialin identify crucial residues and substrate-induced conformational changes.",
        "Abstract": "Salla disease and infantile sialic acid storage disorder are human diseases caused by loss of function of sialin, a lysosomal transporter that mediates H(+)-coupled symport of acidic sugars N-acetylneuraminic acid and glucuronic acid out of lysosomes. Along with the closely related vesicular glutamate transporters, sialin belongs to the SLC17 transporter family. Despite their critical role in health and disease, these proteins remain poorly understood both structurally and mechanistically. Here, we use substituted cysteine accessibility screening and radiotracer flux assays to evaluate experimentally a computationally generated three-dimensional structure model of sialin. According to this model, sialin consists of 12 transmembrane helices (TMs) with an overall architecture similar to that of the distantly related glycerol 3-phosphate transporter GlpT. We show that TM4 in sialin lines a large aqueous cavity that forms a part of the substrate permeation pathway and demonstrate substrate-induced alterations in accessibility of substituted cysteine residues in TM4. In addition, we demonstrate that one mutant, F179C, has a dramatically different effect on the apparent affinity and transport rate for N-acetylneuraminic acid and glucuronic acid, suggesting that it may be directly involved in substrate recognition and/or translocation. These findings offer a basis for further defining the transport mechanism of sialin and other SLC17 family members.",

        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter-sodium symporters (NSS), targets for psychostimulants and therapeutic drugs, have a critical role in neurotransmission. Whereas eukaryotic NSS show chloride-dependent transport, bacterial NSS feature Cl(-)-independent substrate transport. Recently we showed that mutation of an acidic residue near one of the sodium ion-binding sites in LeuT of Aquifex aeolicus or Tyt1 of Fusobacterium nucleatum renders substrate binding and/or transport Cl(-) dependent. We reasoned that the negative charge--provided either by Cl(-) or by the transporter itself--is required for substrate translocation. Here we show that Tyt1 reconstituted in proteoliposomes is strictly dependent on the Na(+) gradient and is stimulated by an inside negative membrane potential and by an inversely oriented proton gradient. Notably, Na(+)/substrate symport elicited H(+) efflux, indicative of Na(+)/substrate symport-coupled H(+) antiport. Mutations that render the transport phenotype Cl(-) dependent essentially abolish the pH dependence. We propose unifying features of charge balance by all NSS members with similar mechanistic features but different molecular solutions.",

        "Abstract": "Urea is highly concentrated in the mammalian kidney to produce the osmotic gradient necessary for water re-absorption. Free diffusion of urea across cell membranes is slow owing to its high polarity, and specialized urea transporters have evolved to achieve rapid and selective urea permeation. Here we present the 2.3 A structure of a functional urea transporter from the bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris. The transporter is a homotrimer, and each subunit contains a continuous membrane-spanning pore formed by the two homologous halves of the protein. The pore contains a constricted selectivity filter that can accommodate several dehydrated urea molecules in single file. Backbone and side-chain oxygen atoms provide continuous coordination of urea as it progresses through the filter, and well-placed alpha-helix dipoles provide further compensation for dehydration energy. These results establish that the urea transporter operates by a channel-like mechanism and reveal the physical and chemical basis of urea selectivity.",

        "Abstract": "The first crystal structure of the neurotransmitter/sodium symporter homolog LeuT revealed an occluded binding pocket containing leucine and 2 Na(+); later structures showed tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in an extracellular vestibule approximately 11 A above the bound leucine and 2 Na(+). We recently found this region to be a second binding (S2) site and that binding of substrate to this site triggers Na(+)-coupled substrate symport. Here, we show a profound inhibitory effect of n-octyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside (OG), the detergent used for LeuT crystallization, on substrate binding to the S2 site. In parallel, we determined at 2.8 A the structure of LeuT-E290S, a mutant that, like LeuT-WT, binds 2 substrate molecules. This structure was similar to that of WT and clearly revealed an OG molecule in the S2 site. We also observed electron density at the S2 site in LeuT-WT crystals, and this also was accounted for by an OG molecule in that site. Computational analyses, based on the available crystal structures of LeuT, indicated the nature of structural arrangements in the extracellular region of LeuT that differentiate the actions of substrates from inhibitors bound in the S2 site. We conclude that the current LeuT crystal structures, all of which have been solved in OG, represent functionally blocked forms of the transporter, whereas a substrate bound in the S2 site will promote a different state that is essential for Na(+)-coupled symport.",

        "Abstract": "Eukaryotic neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs), targets for antidepressants and psychostimulants, terminate neurotransmission by sodium-driven reuptake. The crystal structure of LeuT(Aa), a prokaryotic NSS homolog, revealed an occluded state in which one leucine and two Na(+) ions are bound, but provided limited clues to the molecular mechanism of transport. Using steered molecular dynamics simulations, we explored the substrate translocation pathway of LeuT. We identified a second substrate binding site located in the extracellular vestibule comprised of residues shown recently to participate in binding tricyclic antidepressants. Binding and flux experiments showed that the two binding sites can be occupied simultaneously. The substrate in the secondary site allosterically triggers intracellular release of Na(+) and substrate from the primary site, thereby functioning as a \"symport effector.\" Because tricyclic antidepressants bind differently to this secondary site, they do not promote substrate release from the primary site and thus act as symport uncouplers and inhibit transport.",

        "Abstract": "Ubiquitous solute carriers 11 (SLC11) contribute to metal-ion homeostasis by importing Me(2+) and H(+) into the cytoplasm. To identify residues mediating cation symport, Escherichia coli proton-dependent manganese transporter (MntH) was mutated at five SLC11-specific transmembrane (TM) sites; each mutant activity was compared with wild-type MntH, and the biochemical results were tested by homology threading. Cd(2+) and H(+) uptake kinetics were analyzed in whole cells as a function of pH and temperature, and right-side out membrane vesicles were used to detail energy requirements and to probe site accessibility by Cys replacement and thiol modification. This approach revealed that TM segment 1 (TMS1) residue Asp(34) couples H(+) and Me(2+) symport and contributes to MntH forward transport electrogenicity, whereas the TMS6 His(211) residue mediates pH-dependent Me(2+) uptake; MntH Asn(37), Asn(250), and Asn(401) in TMS1, TMS7, and TMS11 participate in transporter cycling and/or helix packing interactions. These biochemical results fit the LeuT/SLC6 structural fold, which suggests that conserved peptide motifs Asp(34)-Pro-Gly (TMS1) and Met-Pro-His(211) (TMS6) form antiparallel \"TM helix/extended peptide\" boundaries, lining a \"pore\" cavity and enabling H(+)-dependent Me(2+) import.",

        "Title": "Mechanism of chloride interaction with neurotransmitter:sodium symporters.",
        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSS) have a critical role in regulating neurotransmission and are targets for psychostimulants, anti-depressants and other drugs. Whereas the non-homologous glutamate transporters mediate chloride conductance, in the eukaryotic NSS chloride is transported together with the neurotransmitter. In contrast, transport by the bacterial NSS family members LeuT, Tyt1 and TnaT is chloride independent. The crystal structure of LeuT reveals an occluded binding pocket containing leucine and two sodium ions, and is highly relevant for the neurotransmitter transporters. However, the precise role of chloride in neurotransmitter transport and the location of its binding site remain elusive. Here we show that introduction of a negatively charged amino acid at or near one of the two putative sodium-binding sites of the GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) transporter GAT-1 from rat brain (also called SLC6A1) renders both net flux and exchange of GABA largely chloride independent. In contrast to wild-type GAT-1, a marked stimulation of the rate of net flux, but not of exchange, was observed when the internal pH was lowered. Equivalent mutations introduced in the mouse GABA transporter GAT4 (SLC6A11) and the human dopamine transporter DAT (SLC6A3) also result in chloride-independent transport, whereas the reciprocal mutations in LeuT and Tyt1 render substrate binding and/or uptake by these bacterial NSS chloride dependent. Our data indicate that the negative charge, provided either by chloride or by the transporter itself, is required during binding and translocation of the neurotransmitter, probably to counterbalance the charge of the co-transported sodium ions.",

        "Abstract": "Transport proteins constitute approximately 10% of most proteomes and play vital roles in the translocation of solutes across membranes of all organisms. Their (dys)function is implicated in many disorders, making them frequent targets for pharmacotherapy. The identification of substrates for members of this large protein family, still replete with many orphans of unknown function, has proven difficult, in part because high-throughput screening is greatly complicated by endogenous transporters present in many expression systems. In addition, direct structural studies require that transporters be extracted from the membrane with detergent, thereby precluding transport measurements because of the lack of a vectorial environment and necessitating reconstitution into proteoliposomes for activity measurements. Here, we describe a direct scintillation proximity-based radioligand-binding assay for determining transport protein function in crude cell extracts and in purified form. This rapid and universally applicable assay with advantages over cell-based platforms will greatly facilitate the identification of substrates for many orphan transporters and allows monitoring the function of transport proteins in a nonmembranous environment.",

        "Abstract": "The gene of a novel prokaryotic member (Tyt1) of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family has been cloned from Fusobacterium nucleatum. In contrast to eukaryotic and some prokaryotic NSSs, which contain 12 transmembrane domains (TMs), Tyt1 contains only 11 TMs, a characteristic shared by approximately 70% of prokaryotic NSS homologues. Nonetheless upon heterologous expression in an engineered Escherichia coli host, Tyt1 catalyzes robust Na+-dependent, highly selective l-tyrosine transport. Genetic engineering of Tyt1 variants devoid of cysteines or with individually retained endogenous cysteines at positions 18 or 238, at the cytoplasmic ends of TM1 and TM6, respectively, preserved normal transport activity. Whereas cysteine-less Tyt1 was resistant to the inhibitory effect of sulfhydryl-alkylating reagents, N-ethylmaleimide inhibited transport by Tyt1 variants containing either one or both of the endogenous cysteines, and this inhibition was altered by the substrates sodium and tyrosine, consistent with substrate-induced dynamics in the transport pathway. Our findings support a binding model of Tyt1 function in which an ordered sequence of substrate-induced structural changes reflects distinct conformational states of the transporter. This work identifies Tyt1 as the first functional bacterial NSS member putatively consisting of only 11 TMs and shows that Tyt1 is a suitable model for the study of NSS dynamics with relevance to structure/function relationships of human NSSs, including the dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and gamma-aminobutyric acid transporters.",

        "Abstract": "The extracellular concentration of the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA and glycine is tightly controlled by plasma membrane transporters belonging to the SLC6 gene family. A very large number of putative transport proteins with a remarkable homology to the SLC6 transporters has recently been identified in prokaryotes. Here we have probed structural relationships in a 'microdoman' corresponding to the extracellular ends of transmembrane segments (TM) 7 and 8 in one of these homologs, the tryptophan transporter TnaT from Symbiobacterium thermophilum. We found that simultaneous - but not individual - substitution of Ala286 at the top of TM7 and Met311 at the top of TM8 with cysteines conferred sensitivity to submicromolar concentrations of Hg(2+) as assessed in a [(3)H]tryptophan uptake assay. Because Hg(2+) can cross-link pairs of cysteines, this suggests close proximity between TM 7 and 8 in the tertiary structure of TnaT as previously suggested for the mammalian counterparts. Furthermore, the inhibition of uptake upon cross-linking the two cysteines provides indirect support for a conserved conformational role of these transmembrane domains in the transport process. It was not possible, however, to transfer to TnaT binding sites for another metal ion, Zn(2+), that we previously engineered in the dopamine (DAT) and GABA (GAT-1) transporters between TM 7 and 8. This suggests that the structure of the TM7/8 microdomain is not identical with that of DAT and GAT-1. Hence, our data also emphasize possible structural differences that should be taken into account when interpreting future data on bacterial homologs of the SLC6 transporters.",

        "Abstract": "The functional characteristics of the forward and reverse transport modes of the human Na(+)/glucose transporter (hSGLT1) were investigated using plasma membrane vesicles of E. coli expressing the recombinant transporter. Correctly and inverse-oriented vesicles were employed to measure the initial rates of methyl-alpha-D-glucose uptake, under zero-trans conditions, as a function of Na(+), sugar, and phlorizin concentrations and membrane potential. This approach enabled the analysis of the two faces of hSGLT1 in parallel, revealing the reversibility of Na(+)/sugar cotransport. While the key characteristics of secondary active sugar transport were maintained in both modes, namely, Na(+) and voltage dependence, the kinetic properties of the two sides indicated a functional asymmetry of the transporter. That is, the apparent affinity for sugar and driver cation Na(+) exhibited a difference of more than 1 order of magnitude between the two modes. Furthermore, the selectivity pattern of ligands and the interaction of the transporter with the competitive inhibitor phlorizin were different. Whereas the high-affinity substrates, D-glucose and D-galactose, inhibited uptake of radioactive sugar tracer at their physiological concentrations (10 mM) in the forward reaction, they were poor inhibitors even at high concentrations in the reverse transport mode. Taken together, these results confirm the successful employment of E. coli to express and characterize a human membrane protein (hSGLT1), elucidating the functional asymmetry of this cotransporter.",

        "Abstract": "Large-scale purification of recombinant human membrane proteins represents a rate-limiting step toward the understanding of their role in health and disease. There are only four mammalian membrane proteins of known structure, and these were isolated from natural sources (see http://www.mpibp-frankfurt.mpg.de/michel/public/memprotstruct.html). In addition, genetic diseases of membrane proteins are frequently caused by trafficking defects, and it is enigmatic whether these mutants are functional. Here, we report the employment of Escherichia coli for the functional expression, purification, and reconstitution of a human membrane protein, the human Na+/glucose cotransporter (hSGLT1). The use of an E. coli mutant defective in the outer membrane protease OmpT, incubation temperatures below 20 degrees C, and transcriptional regulation from the lac promoter/operator are crucial to reduce proteolytic degradation. Purification of a recombinant hSGLT1 through affinity chromatography yields about 1 mg of purified recombinant hSGLT1 per 3 liters of cultured bacterial cells. Kinetic analysis of hSGLT1 in proteoliposomes reveals that a purified recombinant transporter, which is missorted in eukaryotic cells, retains full catalytic activity. These results indicate the power of bacteria to manufacture and isolate human membrane proteins implicated in genetic diseases.",

        "Title": "Sites important for Na+ and substrate binding in the Na+/proline transporter of Escherichia coli, a member of the Na+/solute symporter family.",
        "Abstract": "To elucidate the functional importance of transmembrane domain II in the Na(+)/proline transporter (PutP) of Escherichia coli we analyzed the effect of replacing Ser-54 through Gly-58. Substitution of Asp-55 or Met-56 dramatically reduces the apparent affinity for Na(+) and Li(+) in a cation-dependent manner. Conversely, Cys in place of Gly-58 significantly reduces only the apparent proline affinity while substitution of Ser-57 results in a dramatic reduction of the apparent proline and cation affinities. Interestingly, upon increasing the proline concentration the apparent Na(+) affinity of Ser-57 replacement mutants converges toward the wild-type value, indicating a close cooperativity between cation and substrate site(s). This notion is supported by the fact that Na(+)-stimulated site-specific fluorescence labeling of a single Cys at position 57 is completely reversed by the addition of proline. Similar results are obtained upon labeling of a Cys at position 54 or 58. Taken together, these results indicate that Asp-55 and Met-56 are located at or close to the ion-binding site while Ser-54, Ser-57, and Gly-58 may be close to the proline translocation pathway. In addition, the data prod at an involvement of the latter residues in ligand-induced conformational dynamics that are crucial for cation-coupled transport.",
