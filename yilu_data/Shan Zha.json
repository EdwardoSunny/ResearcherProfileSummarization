        "Title": "The dynamics and regulation of PARP1 and PARP2 in response to DNA damage and during replication.",
        "Abstract": "DNA strand breaks activate Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1 and 2, which use NAD+ as the substrate to covalently conjugate ADP-ribose on themselves and other proteins (e.g., Histone) to promote chromatin relaxation and recruit additional DNA repair factors. Enzymatic inhibitors of PARP1 and PARP2 (PARPi) are promising cancer therapy agents that selectively target BRCA1- or BRCA2- deficient cancers. As immediate early responders to DNA strand breaks with robust activities, PARP1 and PARP2 normally form transient foci (<10\u202fminutes) at the micro-irradiation-induced DNA lesions. In addition to enzymatic inhibition, PARPi also extend the presence of PARP1 and PARP2 at DNA lesions, including at replication forks, where they may post a physical block for subsequent repair and DNA replication. The dynamic nature of PARP1 and PARP2 foci made live cell imaging a unique platform to detect subtle changes and the functional interaction among PARP1, PARP2, and their regulators. Recent imaging studies have provided new understandings of the biological consequence of PARP inhibition and uncovered functional interactions between PARP1 and PARP2 and new regulators (e.g., histone poly(ADP-ribosylation) factor). Here, we review recent advances in dissecting the temporal and spatial Regulation of PARP1 and PARP2 at DNA lesions and discuss their physiological implications on both cancer and normal cells.",

        "Title": "XRCC1 mediates PARP1- and PAR-dependent recruitment of PARP2 to DNA damage sites.",
        "Abstract": "Poly-ADP-ribose polymerases 1 and 2 (PARP1 and PARP2) are crucial sensors of DNA-strand breaks and emerging cancer therapy targets. Once activated by DNA breaks, PARP1 and PARP2 generate poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) chains on themselves and other substrates to promote DNA single-strand break repair (SSBR). PARP1 can be activated by diverse DNA lesions, whereas PARP2 specifically recognizes 5' phosphorylated nicks. They can be activated independently and provide mutual backup in the absence of the other. However, whether PARP1 and PARP2 have synergistic functions in DNA damage response remains elusive. Here, we show that PARP1 and the PAR chains generated by PARP1 recruit PARP2 to the vicinity of DNA damage sites through the scaffold protein XRCC1. Using quantitative live-cell imaging, we found that loss of XRCC1 markedly reduces irradiation-induced PARP2 foci in PARP1-proficient cells. The central BRCT domain (BRCT1) of XRCC1 binds to the PAR chain, while the C-terminal BRCT domain (BRCT2) of XRCC1 interacts with the catalytic domain of PARP2, facilitating its localization near the breaks. Together, these findings unveil a new function of XRCC1 in augmenting PARP2 recruitment in response to PARP1 activation and explain why PARP1, but not PARP2, is aggregated and hyperactivated in XRCC1-deficient cells.",

        "Abstract": "Aging is underpinned by pronounced metabolic decline; however, the drivers remain obscure. Here, we report that IgG accumulates during aging, particularly in white adipose tissue (WAT), to impair adipose tissue function and metabolic health. Caloric restriction (CR) decreases IgG accumulation in WAT, whereas replenishing IgG counteracts CR's metabolic benefits. IgG activates macrophages via Ras signaling and consequently induces fibrosis in WAT through the TGF-\u03b2/SMAD pathway. Consistently, B cell null mice are protected from aging-associated WAT fibrosis, inflammation, and insulin resistance, unless exposed to IgG. Conditional ablation of the IgG recycling receptor, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), in macrophages prevents IgG accumulation in aging, resulting in prolonged healthspan and lifespan. Further, targeting FcRn by antisense oligonucleotide restores WAT integrity and metabolic health in aged mice. These findings pinpoint IgG as a hidden culprit in aging and enlighten a novel strategy to rejuvenate metabolic health.",

        "Abstract": "Interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)-associated kinases (IRAKs) are core effectors of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and IL-1R in innate immunity. Here, we found that IRAK4 and IRAK1 together inhibited DNA damage-induced cell death independently of TLR or IL-1R signaling. In human cancer cells, IRAK4 was activated downstream of ATR kinase in response to double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation (IR). Activated IRAK4 then formed a complex with and activated IRAK1. The formation of this complex required the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino1, acting structurally but not catalytically, and the activation of IRAK1 occurred independently of extracellular signaling, intracellular TLRs, and the TLR/IL-1R signaling adaptor MyD88. Activated IRAK1 translocated to the nucleus in a Pellino2-dependent manner. In the nucleus, IRAK1 bound to the PIDD1 subunit of the proapoptotic PIDDosome and interfered with platform assembly, thus supporting cell survival. This noncanonical IRAK signaling pathway was also activated in response to other DSB-inducing agents. The loss of IRAK4, of IRAK4 kinase activity, of either Pellino protein, or of the nuclear localization sequence in IRAK1 sensitized p53-mutant zebrafish to radiation. Thus, the findings may lead to strategies for overcoming tumor resistance to conventional cancer treatments.",

        "Abstract": "The ATR kinase, which coordinates cellular responses to DNA replication stress, is also essential for the proliferation of normal unstressed cells. Although its role in the replication stress response is well defined, the mechanisms by which ATR supports normal cell proliferation remain elusive. Here, we show that ATR is dispensable for the viability of G0-arrested na\u00efve B cells. However, upon cytokine-induced proliferation, Atr-deficient B cells initiate DNA replication efficiently, but by mid-S phase they display dNTP depletion, fork stalling, and replication failure. Nonetheless, productive DNA replication and dNTP levels\u00a0can be restored in Atr-deficient cells by suppressing origin firing, such as partial inhibition of CDC7 and CDK1 kinase activities. Together, these findings indicate that ATR supports the proliferation of normal unstressed cells by tempering the pace of origin firing during the early S phase to avoid exhaustion of dNTPs and importantly also\u00a0other replication factors.",

        "Abstract": "Oncogenic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) produce 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which inhibits dioxygenases that modulate chromatin dynamics. The effects of 2HG have been reported to sensitize IDH tumors to poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. However, unlike PARP-inhibitor-sensitive BRCA1/2 tumors, which exhibit impaired homologous recombination, IDH-mutant tumors have a silent mutational profile and lack signatures associated with impaired homologous recombination. Instead, 2HG-producing IDH mutations lead to a heterochromatin-dependent slowing of DNA replication accompanied by increased replication stress and DNA double-strand breaks. This replicative stress manifests as replication fork slowing, but the breaks are repaired without a significant increase in mutation burden. Faithful resolution of replicative stress in IDH-mutant cells is dependent on poly-(ADP-ribosylation). Treatment with PARP inhibitors increases DNA replication but results in incomplete DNA repair. These findings demonstrate a role for PARP in the replication of heterochromatin and further validate PARP as a therapeutic target in IDH-mutant tumors.",

        "Abstract": "The nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway is a major DNA double-strand break repair pathway in mammals and is essential for lymphocyte development. Ku70 and Ku80 heterodimer (KU) initiates NHEJ, thereby recruiting and activating the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). While DNA-PKcs deletion only moderately impairs end-ligation, the expression of kinase-dead DNA-PKcs completely abrogates NHEJ. Active DNA-PK phosphorylates DNA-PKcs at two clusters-PQR around S2056 (S2053 in mouse) and ABCDE around T2609. Alanine substitution at the S2056 cluster moderately compromises end-ligation on plasmid-based assays. But, mice carrying alanine substitution at all five serine residues within the S2056 cluster (",

        "Abstract": "The ATR kinase, which coordinates cellular responses to DNA replication stress, is also essential for the proliferation of normal unstressed cells. Although its role in the replication stress response is well defined, the mechanisms by which ATR supports normal cell proliferation remain elusive. Here, we show that ATR is dispensable for the viability of G0-arrested na\u00efve B cells. However, upon cytokine-induced proliferation, Atr-deficient B cells initiate DNA replication efficiently in early S phase, but by mid-S phase they display dNTP depletion, fork stalling, and replication failure. Nonetheless, productive DNA replication can be restored in Atr-deficient cells by pathways that suppress origin firing, such as downregulation of CDC7 and CDK1 kinase activities. Together, these findings indicate that ATR supports the proliferation of normal unstressed cells by tempering the pace of origin firing during the early S phase to avoid exhaustion of dNTPs and other replication factors.",

        "Abstract": "PARP1 and PARP2 detect DNA breaks, which activates their catalytic production of poly(ADP-ribose) that recruits repair factors and contributes to PARP1/2 release from DNA. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are used in cancer treatment and target PARP1/2 catalytic activity, interfering with repair and increasing PARP1/2 persistence on DNA damage. In addition, certain PARPi exert allosteric effects that increase PARP1 retention on DNA. However, no clinical PARPi exhibit this allosteric behavior toward PARP1. In contrast, we show that certain clinical PARPi exhibit an allosteric effect that retains PARP2 on DNA breaks in a manner that depends on communication between the catalytic and DNA binding regions. Using a PARP2 mutant that mimics an allosteric inhibitor effect, we observed increased PARP2 retention at cellular damage sites. The PARPi AZD5305 also exhibited a clear reverse allosteric effect on PARP2. Our results can help explain the toxicity of clinical PARPi and suggest ways to improve PARPi moving forward.",

        "Abstract": "The ideal technology for directly investigating the relationship between genotype and phenotype would analyze both RNA and DNA genome-wide and with single-cell resolution. However, existing tools lack the throughput required for comprehensive analysis of complex tumors and tissues. We introduce a highly scalable method for jointly profiling DNA and expression following nucleosome depletion (DEFND-seq). In DEFND-seq, nuclei are nucleosome-depleted, tagmented, and separated into individual droplets for mRNA and genomic DNA barcoding. Once nuclei have been depleted of nucleosomes, subsequent steps can be performed using the widely available 10x Genomics droplet microfluidic technology and commercial kits without experimental modification. We demonstrate the production of high-complexity mRNA and gDNA sequencing libraries from thousands of individual nuclei from both cell lines and archived surgical specimens for associating gene expression phenotypes with both copy number and single nucleotide variants.",

        "Abstract": "Interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)-associated kinases (IRAKs) are core effectors of Toll-like receptor (TLR) and IL-1R signaling, with no reported roles outside of innate immunity. We find that vertebrate cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) sequentially activate IRAK4 and IRAK1 through a phosphorylation cascade mirroring that induced by TLR/IL-1R, resulting in a potent anti-apoptotic response. However, IR-induced IRAK1 activation does not require the receptors or the IRAK4/1 adaptor protein MyD88, and instead of remaining in the cytoplasm, the activated kinase is immediately transported to the nucleus via a conserved nuclear localization signal. We identify: double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) as the biologic trigger for this pathway; the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino1 as the scaffold enabling IRAK4/1 activation in place of TLR/IL-1R-MyD88; and the pro-apoptotic PIDDosome (PIDD1-RAIDD-caspase-2) as a critical downstream target in the nucleus. The data delineate a non-canonical IRAK signaling pathway derived from, or ancestral to, TLR signaling. This DSB detection pathway, which is also activated by genotoxic chemotherapies, provides multiple actionable targets for overcoming tumor resistance to mainstay cancer treatments.",

Here we describe multiscale three-dimensional genome reorganization following DNA damage and analyze the contribution of the nuclear WASP-ARP2/3-actin pathway toward chromatin topology alterations and pathologic repair. Hi-C analysis reveals genome-wide, DNA damage-induced chromatin compartment flips facilitated by ARP2/3 that enrich for open, A compartments. Damage promotes interactions between DSBs, which in turn facilitate aberrant, actin-dependent intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangements. Our work establishes that clustering of resected DSBs into repair domains by nuclear actin assembly is coordinated with multiscale alterations in genome architecture that enable homology-directed repair while also increasing nonhomologous end-joining-dependent translocation frequency.",

        "Abstract": "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) and 2 (PARP2) are two DNA damage-induced poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerases in cells and are the targets of PARP inhibitors used for cancer therapy. Strand breaks recruit and activate PARP1 and 2, which rapidly generate PAR from NAD+. PAR promotes the recruitment of other repair factors, relaxes chromatin, and has a role in DNA repair, transcription regulation, and RNA biology. Four PARP1/2 dual inhibitors are currently used to treat BRCA-deficient breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. In addition to blocking the enzymatic activity of PARP1 and 2, clinical PARP inhibitors extend the appearance of PARP1 and PARP2 on chromatin after damage, termed trapping. Loss of PARP1 confers resistance to PARP inhibitors, suggesting an essential role of trapping in cancer therapy. Yet, whether the persistent PARP1 and 2 foci at the DNA damage sites are caused by the retention of the same molecules or by the continual exchange of different molecules remains unknown. Here, we discuss recent results from quantitative live-cell imaging studies focusing on PARP1 and PARP2's distinct DNA substrate specificities and modes of recruitment and trapping with implications for cancer therapy and on-target toxicities of PARP inhibitors.",

        "Title": "PARP inhibitors trap PARP2 and alter the mode of recruitment of PARP2 at DNA damage sites.",
        "Abstract": "Dual-inhibitors of PARP1 and PARP2 are promising anti-cancer drugs. In addition to blocking PARP1&2 enzymatic activity, PARP inhibitors also extend the lifetime of DNA damage-induced PARP1&2 foci, termed trapping. Trapping is important for the therapeutic effects of PARP inhibitors. Using live-cell imaging, we found that PARP inhibitors cause persistent PARP2 foci by switching the mode of PARP2 recruitment from a predominantly PARP1- and PAR-dependent rapid exchange to a WGR domain-mediated stalling of PARP2 on DNA. Specifically, PARP1-deletion markedly reduces but does not abolish PARP2 foci. The residual PARP2 foci in PARP1-deficient cells are DNA-dependent and abrogated by the R140A mutation in the WGR domain. Yet, PARP2-R140A forms normal foci in PARP1-proficient cells. In PARP1-deficient cells, PARP inhibitors - niraparib, talazoparib, and, to a lesser extent, olaparib - enhance PARP2 foci by preventing PARP2 exchange. This trapping of PARP2 is independent of auto-PARylation and is abolished by the R140A mutation in the WGR domain and the H415A mutation in the catalytic domain. Taken together, we found that PARP inhibitors trap PARP2 by physically stalling PARP2 on DNA via the WGR-DNA interaction while suppressing the PARP1- and PAR-dependent rapid exchange of PARP2.",

PARPs are sensors that detect single-strand break intermediates, but the critical role of XRCC1 during BER is unknown. Here, we show that protein complexes containing DNA polymerase \u03b2 and DNA ligase III that are assembled by XRCC1 prevent excessive engagement and activity of PARP1 during BER. As a result, PARP1 becomes \"trapped\" on BER intermediates in XRCC1-deficient cells in a manner similar to that induced by PARP inhibitors, including in patient fibroblasts from XRCC1-mutated disease. This excessive PARP1 engagement and trapping renders BER intermediates inaccessible to enzymes such as DNA polymerase \u03b2 and impedes their repair. Consequently, PARP1 deletion rescues BER and resistance to base damage in XRCC1",

        "Abstract": "Silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) have outstanding physicochemical characteristics, including the ability to interact with proteins and DNA. Given the growing number of diagnostic and therapeutic applications of AgNCs, we evaluated the impact of AgNCs on DNA replication and DNA damage response in cell-free extracts prepared from unfertilized Xenopus laevis eggs. We find that, among a number of silver nanomaterials, AgNCs uniquely inhibited genomic DNA replication and abrogated the DNA replication checkpoint in cell-free extracts. AgNCs did not affect nuclear membrane or nucleosome assembly. AgNCs-supplemented extracts showed a strong defect in the loading of the mini chromosome maintenance (MCM) protein complex, the helicase that unwinds DNA ahead of replication forks. FLAG-AgNCs immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis of AgNCs associated proteins demonstrated direct interaction between MCM and AgNCs. Our studies indicate that AgNCs directly prevent the loading of MCM, blocking pre-replication complex (pre-RC) assembly and subsequent DNA replication initiation. Collectively, our findings broaden the scope of silver nanomaterials experimental applications, establishing AgNCs as a novel tool to study chromosomal DNA replication.",

Most cancer-associated alterations to ATM are missense mutations at the PI3-kinase regulatory domain (PRD) or the kinase domain. Expression of kinase-dead (KD) ATM protein solely accelerates lymphomagenesis beyond ATM loss. To understand how PRD suppresses lymphomagenesis, we introduced the cancer-associated PRD mutation R3008H (R3016 in mouse) into mice. R3008H abrogated DNA damage- and oxidative stress-induced activation of ATM without consistently affecting ATM protein stability and recruitment. In contrast to the early embryonic lethality of ",

        "Abstract": "To generate antibodies with different effector functions, B cells undergo Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain (IgH) class switch recombination (CSR). The ligation step of CSR is usually mediated by the classical nonhomologous end-joining (cNHEJ) pathway. In cNHEJ-deficient cells, a remarkable \u223c25% of CSR can be achieved by the alternative end-joining (Alt-EJ) pathway that preferentially uses microhomology (MH) at the junctions. While A-EJ-mediated repair of endonuclease-generated breaks requires DNA end resection, we show that CtIP-mediated DNA end resection is dispensable for A-EJ-mediated CSR using cNHEJ-deficient B cells. High-throughput sequencing analyses revealed that loss of ATM/ATR phosphorylation of CtIP at T855 or ATM kinase inhibition suppresses resection without altering the MH pattern of the A-EJ-mediated switch junctions. Moreover, we found that ATM kinase promotes Alt-EJ-mediated CSR by suppressing interchromosomal translocations independent of end resection. Finally, temporal analyses reveal that MHs are enriched in early internal deletions even in cNHEJ-proficient B cells. Thus, we propose that repetitive IgH switch regions represent favored substrates for MH-mediated end-joining contributing to the robustness and resection independence of A-EJ-mediated CSR.",

        "Abstract": "DNA breaks recruit and activate PARP1/2, which deposit poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) to recruit XRCC1-Ligase3 and other repair factors to promote DNA repair. Clinical PARP inhibitors (PARPi) extend the lifetime of damage-induced PARP1/2 foci, referred to as 'trapping'. To understand the molecular nature of 'trapping' in cells, we employed quantitative live-cell imaging and fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching. Unexpectedly, we found that PARP1 exchanges rapidly at DNA damage sites even in the presence of clinical PARPi, suggesting the persistent foci are not caused by physical stalling. Loss of Xrcc1, a major downstream effector of PAR, also caused persistent PARP1 foci without affecting PARP1 exchange. Thus, we propose that the persistent PARP1 foci are formed by different PARP1 molecules that are continuously recruited to and exchanging at DNA lesions due to attenuated XRCC1-LIG3 recruitment and delayed DNA repair. Moreover, mutation analyses of the NAD+ interacting residues of PARP1 showed that PARP1 can be physically trapped at DNA damage sites, and identified H862 as a potential regulator for PARP1 exchange. PARP1-H862D, but not PARylation-deficient PARP1-E988K, formed stable PARP1 foci upon activation. Together, these findings uncovered the nature of persistent PARP1 foci and identified NAD+ interacting residues involved in the PARP1 exchange.",

Na\u00efve B cells undergo class switch recombination (CSR) to generate antibodies with different isotypes by joining two DNA double-strand breaks at different switching regions via the cNHEJ pathway. DNA-PK and the cNHEJ pathway play important roles in the DNA repair phase of CSR. To initiate cNHEJ, KU binds to DNA ends and recruits and activates DNA-PK. Activated DNA-PK phosphorylates DNA-PKcs at the S2056 and T2609 clusters.

        "Abstract": "Lymphocyte development requires ordered assembly and subsequent modifications of the antigen receptor genes through V(D)J recombination and Immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR), respectively. While the programmed DNA cleavage events are initiated by lymphocyte-specific factors, the resulting DNA double-strand break (DSB) intermediates activate the ATM kinase-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) and rely on the ubiquitously expressed classical non-homologous end-joining (cNHEJ) pathway including the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and, in the case of CSR, also the alternative end-joining (Alt-EJ) pathway, for repair. Correspondingly, patients and animal models with cNHEJ or DDR defects develop distinct types of immunodeficiency reflecting their specific DNA repair deficiency. The unique end-structure, sequence context, and cell cycle regulation of V(D)J recombination and CSR also provide a valuable platform to study the mechanisms of, and the interplay between, cNHEJ and DDR. Here, we compare and contrast the genetic consequences of DNA repair defects in V(D)J recombination and CSR with a focus on the newly discovered cNHEJ factors and the kinase-dependent structural roles of ATM and DNA-PK in animal models. Throughout, we try to highlight the pending questions and emerging differences that will extend our understanding of cNHEJ and DDR in the context of primary immunodeficiency and lymphoid malignancies.",

        "Abstract": "Programmed DNA recombination in mammalian cells occurs predominantly in a directional manner. While random DNA breaks are typically repaired both by deletion and by inversion at approximately equal proportions, V(D)J and class switch recombination (CSR) of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene overwhelmingly delete intervening sequences to yield productive rearrangement. What factors channel chromatin breaks to deletional CSR in lymphocytes is unknown. Integrating CRISPR knockout and chemical perturbation screening we here identify the Snf2-family helicase-like ERCC6L2 as one such factor. We show that ERCC6L2 promotes double-strand break end-joining and facilitates optimal CSR in mice. At the\u00a0cellular levels, ERCC6L2 rapidly engages in DNA repair through its C-terminal domains. Mechanistically, ERCC6L2 interacts with other end-joining factors and plays a functionally redundant role with the XLF end-joining factor in V(D)J recombination. Strikingly, ERCC6L2 controls orientation-specific joining of broken ends during CSR, which relies on its helicase activity. Thus, ERCC6L2 facilitates programmed recombination through directional repair of distant breaks.",

        "Abstract": "Radiation dosimeters are critical for accurately assessing the levels of radiation exposure of tumor sites and surrounding tissues and for optimizing therapeutic interventions as well as for monitoring environmental exposure. To fill the need for a simple, user-friendly, and inexpensive dosimeter, we designed an innovative colorimetric nanosensor-based assay for detecting ionizing radiation. We show that hydroxyl radicals generated by ionizing radiation can be used to etch gold nanorods (AuNRs) and silver nanoprisms (AgNPRs), yielding reproducible color changes for radiation dose detection in the range of 50-2000 rad, broad enough to cover doses used in hyperfractionated, conventional, and hypofractionated radiotherapy. This range of doses detected by this assay correlates with radiation-induced DNA damage response in mammalian cells. Furthermore, this AuNR- and AgNPR-based sensing platform has been established in a paper format that can be readily adopted for a wide range of applications and translation.",

Our review focuses on three PI3-kinase related protein kinases-ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs, which situate at the apex of the mammalian DDR. They are recruited to and activated at the DNA damage sites by their respective sensor protein complexes-MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 for ATM, RPA/ATRIP for ATR and KU70-KU80/86 (XRCC6/XRCC5) for DNA-PKcs. Upon activation, ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs phosphorylate a large number of partially overlapping substrates to promote efficient and accurate DNA repair and to coordinate DNA repair with other DNA metabolic events (",

        "Abstract": "B cell development requires efficient proliferation and successful assembly and modifications of the immunoglobulin gene products. CtIP is an essential gene implicated in end resection and DNA repair. Here, we show that CtIP is essential for early B cell development but dispensable in naive B cells. CtIP loss is well tolerated in G1-arrested B cells and during V(D)J recombination, but in proliferating B cells, CtIP loss leads to a progressive cell death characterized by ATM hyperactivation, G2/M arrest, genomic instability, and 53BP1 nuclear body formation, indicating that the essential role of CtIP during proliferation underscores its stage-specific requirement in B cells. B cell proliferation requires phosphorylation of CtIP at T847 presumably by CDK, but not its interaction with CtBP or Rb or its nuclease activity. CtIP phosphorylation by ATM/ATR at T859 (T855 in mice) promotes end resection in G1-arrested cells but is dispensable for B cell development and class switch recombination, suggesting distinct roles for T859 and T847 phosphorylation in B cell development.",

        "Abstract": "The DNA damage response protein ATM has long been known to influence class switch recombination in ex vivo-cultured B cells. However, an assessment of B cell-intrinsic requirement of ATM in humoral responses in vivo was confounded by the fact that its germline deletion affects T cell function, and B:T cell interactions are critical for in vivo immune responses. In this study, we demonstrate that B cell-specific deletion of ATM in mice leads to reduction in germinal center (GC) frequency and size in response to immunization. We find that loss of ATM induces apoptosis of GC B cells, likely due to unresolved DNA lesions in cells attempting to undergo class-switch recombination. Accordingly, suboptimal GC responses in ATM-deficient animals are characterized by decreased titers of class-switched Abs and decreased rates of somatic hypermutation. These results unmask the critical B cell-intrinsic role of ATM in maintaining an optimal GC response following immunization.",

        "Abstract": "The genome instability syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is caused by null mutations in the ATM gene, that lead to complete loss or inactivation of the gene's product, the ATM protein kinase. ATM is the primary mobilizer of the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) - a broad signaling network in which many components are ATM targets. The major clinical feature of A-T is cerebellar atrophy, characterized by relentless loss of Purkinje and granule cells. In Atm-knockout (Atm-KO) mice, complete loss of Atm leads to a very mild neurological phenotype, suggesting that Atm loss is not sufficient to markedly abrogate cerebellar structure and function in this organism.

        "Abstract": "The modulator of retrovirus infection (MRI or CYREN) is a 30-kDa protein with a conserved N-terminal Ku-binding motif (KBM) and a C-terminal XLF-like motif (XLM). We show that MRI is intrinsically disordered and interacts with many DNA damage response (DDR) proteins, including the kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNA-PKcs and the classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ) factors Ku70, Ku80, XRCC4, XLF, PAXX, and XRCC4. MRI forms large multimeric complexes that depend on its N and C termini and localizes to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), where it promotes the retention of DDR factors. Mice deficient in MRI and XLF exhibit embryonic lethality at a stage similar to those deficient in the core cNHEJ factors XRCC4 or DNA ligase IV. Moreover, MRI is required for cNHEJ-mediated DSB repair in XLF-deficient lymphocytes. We propose that MRI is an adaptor that, through multivalent interactions, increases the avidity of DDR factors to DSB-associated chromatin to promote cNHEJ.",

        "Abstract": "Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive chromosome breakage disorder caused by mutations in the ATM gene. Typically, it presents in early childhood with progressive cerebellar dysfunction along with immunodeficiency and oculocutaneous telangiectasia. An increased risk of malignancy is also associated with the syndrome and, rarely, may be the presenting feature in small children. We describe a 17-year-old boy with slurred speech, mild motor delays and learning disability diagnosed with atypical A-T in the setting of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Suspicion for A-T was raised after review of a peripheral blood karyotype demonstrating rearrangements involving chromosomes 7 and/or 14. The diagnosis was confirmed after molecular testing identified a novel homozygous missense variant in ATM (c.5585T>A; p.Leu1862His) that resulted in protein instability and abolished serine/threonine protein kinase activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of concurrent A-T and lymphoid malignancy diagnoses in an older child or adult with only mild neurological disease. Our experience suggests that screening for the disorder should be considered in any individual with lymphoid malignancy and neurological findings, especially as radiation and certain chemotherapy protocols are contraindicated in A-T.",

        "Abstract": "Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) regulates the DNA damage response as well as DNA double-strand break repair through homologous recombination. Here we show that ATM is hyperactive when the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) is chemically inhibited or when the DNA-PKcs gene is deleted in human cells. Pre-incubation of ATM protein with active DNA-PKcs also significantly reduces ATM activity in\u00a0vitro. We characterize several phosphorylation sites in ATM that are targets of DNA-PKcs and show that phospho-mimetic mutations at these residues significantly inhibit ATM activity and impair ATM signaling upon DNA damage. In contrast, phospho-blocking mutations at one cluster of sites increase the frequency of apoptosis during normal cell growth. DNA-PKcs, which is integral to the non-homologous end joining pathway, thus negatively regulates ATM activity through phosphorylation of ATM. These observations illuminate an important regulatory mechanism for ATM that also controls DNA repair pathway choice.",

        "Abstract": "Missense mutations in ATM kinase, a master regulator of DNA damage responses, are found in many cancers, but their impact on ATM function and implications for cancer therapy are largely unknown. Here we report that 72% of cancer-associated ATM mutations are missense mutations that are enriched around the kinase domain. Expression of kinase-dead ATM (Atm(KD/-)) is more oncogenic than loss of ATM (Atm(-/-)) in mouse models, leading to earlier and more frequent lymphomas with Pten deletions. Kinase-dead ATM protein (Atm-KD), but not loss of ATM (Atm-null), prevents replication-dependent removal of Topo-isomerase I-DNA adducts at the step of strand cleavage, leading to severe genomic instability and hypersensitivity to Topo-isomerase I inhibitors. Correspondingly, Topo-isomerase I inhibitors effectively and preferentially eliminate Atm(KD/-), but not Atm-proficientor Atm(-/-) leukemia in animal models. These findings identify ATM kinase-domain missense mutations as a potent oncogenic event and a biomarker for Topo-isomerase I inhibitor based therapy.",

        "Title": "Loss of p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis promotes genomic instability and premature aging.",
        "Abstract": "Although p53-mediated cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis are well accepted as major tumor suppression mechanisms, the loss of these functions does not directly lead to tumorigenesis, suggesting that the precise roles of these canonical activities of p53 need to be redefined. Here, we report that the cells derived from the mutant mice expressing p533KR, an acetylation-defective mutant that fails to induce cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis, exhibit high levels of aneuploidy upon DNA damage. Moreover, the embryonic lethality caused by the deficiency of XRCC4, a key DNA double strand break repair factor, can be fully rescued in the p533KR/3KR background. Notably, despite high levels of genomic instability, p533KR/3KRXRCC4-/- mice, unlike p53-/- XRCC4-/- mice, are not succumbed to pro-B-cell lymphomas. Nevertheless, p533KR/3KR XRCC4-/- mice display aging-like phenotypes including testicular atrophy, kyphosis, and premature death. Further analyses demonstrate that SLC7A11 is downregulated and that p53-mediated ferroptosis is significantly induced in spleens and testis of p533KR/3KRXRCC4-/- mice. These results demonstrate that the direct role of p53-mediated cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis is to control genomic stability in vivo. Our study not only validates the importance of ferroptosis in p53-mediated tumor suppression in vivo but also reveals that the combination of genomic instability and activation of ferroptosis may promote aging-associated phenotypes.",

        "Abstract": "Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a major DNA double-strand break repair pathway that is conserved in eukaryotes. In vertebrates, NHEJ further acquires end-processing capacities (e.g., hairpin opening) in addition to direct end-ligation. The catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) is a vertebrate-specific NHEJ factor that can be autophosphorylated or transphosphorylated by ATM kinase. Using a mouse model expressing a kinase-dead (KD) DNA-PKcs protein, we show that ATM-mediated transphosphorylation of DNA-PKcs regulates end-processing at the level of Artemis recruitment, while strict autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs is necessary to relieve the physical blockage on end-ligation imposed by the DNA-PKcs protein itself. Accordingly, DNA-PKcs(KD/KD) mice and cells show severe end-ligation defects and p53- and Ku-dependent embryonic lethality, but open hairpin-sealed ends normally in the presence of ATM kinase activity. Together, our findings identify DNA-PKcs as the molecular switch that coordinates end-processing and end-ligation at the DNA ends through differential phosphorylations.",

        "Abstract": "Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a protein kinase and a master regulator of DNA-damage responses. Germline ATM inactivation causes ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) syndrome with severe lymphocytopenia and greatly increased risk for T-cell lymphomas/leukemia. Both A-T and T-cell prolymphoblastic leukemia patients with somatic mutations of ATM frequently carry inv(14;14) between the T-cell receptor \u03b1/\u03b4 (TCR\u03b1/\u03b4) and immunoglobulin H loci, but the molecular origin of this translocation remains elusive. ATM(-/-) mice recapitulate lymphocytopenia of A-T patients and routinely succumb to thymic lymphomas with t(12;14) translocation, syntenic to inv(14;14) in humans. Here we report that deletion of the TCR\u03b4 enhancer (E\u03b4), which initiates TCR\u03b4 rearrangement, significantly improves \u03b1\u03b2 T cell output and effectively prevents t(12;14) translocations in ATM(-/-) mice. These findings identify the genomic instability associated with V(D)J recombination at the TCR\u03b4 locus as the molecular origin of both lymphocytopenia and the signature t(12;14) translocations associated with ATM deficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a major pathway to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which can display different types of broken ends. However, it is unclear how NHEJ factors organize to repair diverse types of DNA breaks. Here, through systematic analysis of the human NHEJ factor interactome, we identify PAXX as a direct interactor of Ku. The crystal structure of PAXX is similar to those of XRCC4 and XLF. Importantly, PAXX-deficient cells are sensitive to DSB-causing agents. Moreover, epistasis analysis demonstrates that PAXX functions together with XLF in response to ionizing radiation-induced complex DSBs, whereas they function redundantly in response to Topo2 inhibitor-induced simple DSBs. Consistently, PAXX and XLF coordinately promote the ligation of complex but not simple DNA ends in vitro. Altogether, our data identify PAXX as a new NHEJ factor and provide insight regarding the organization of NHEJ factors responding to diverse types of DSB ends.",

        "Abstract": "XRCC4-like factor (XLF/Cernunnos) is a component of the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway of double-strand DNA break repair. XLF-deficient patients develop a severe progressive lymphocytopenia. Although NHEJ is required for V(D)J recombination and lymphocyte development, XLF-deficient mice have normal V(D)J recombination, highlighting the need for an alternative mechanism for the lymphocytopenia. Here, we report that XLF-deficient mice recapitulate the age-dependent lymphocytopenia of patients. We show that XLF deficiency leads to premature aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), measured by decreased functional capacity in transplantation assays, preferential myeloid reconstitution, and reduced self-renewal at a young age. We propose that premature aging of HSCs, together with previously reported defects in class-switch recombination and memory immune response, underlies the progressive and severe lymphocytopenia in XLF-deficient patients in the absence of measurable V(D)J recombination defects.",

        "Abstract": "Cells isolated from patients with ataxia telangiectasia are exquisitely sensitive to ionizing radiation. Kinase inhibitors of ATM, the gene mutated in ataxia telangiectasia, can sensitize tumor cells to radiation therapy, but concern that inhibiting ATM in normal tissues will also increase normal tissue toxicity from radiation has limited their clinical application. Endothelial cell damage can contribute to the development of long-term side effects after radiation therapy, but the role of endothelial cell death in tumor response to radiation therapy remains controversial. Here, we developed dual recombinase technology using both FlpO and Cre recombinases to generate primary sarcomas in mice with endothelial cell-specific deletion of Atm to determine whether loss of Atm in endothelial cells sensitizes tumors and normal tissues to radiation. Although deletion of Atm in proliferating tumor endothelial cells enhanced the response of sarcomas to radiation, Atm deletion in quiescent endothelial cells of the heart did not sensitize mice to radiation-induced myocardial necrosis. Blocking cell cycle progression reversed the effect of Atm loss on tumor endothelial cell radiosensitivity. These results indicate that endothelial cells must progress through the cell cycle in order to be radiosensitized by Atm deletion.",

        "Abstract": "Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is activated upon DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and phosphorylates numerous DSB response proteins, including histone H2AX on serine 139 (Ser-139) to form \u03b3-H2AX. Through interaction with MDC1, \u03b3-H2AX promotes DSB repair by homologous recombination (HR). H2AX Ser-139 can also be phosphorylated by DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit and ataxia telangiectasia- and Rad3-related kinase. Thus, we tested whether ATM functions in HR, particularly that controlled by \u03b3-H2AX, by comparing HR occurring at the euchromatic ROSA26 locus between mouse embryonic stem cells lacking either ATM, H2AX, or both. We show here that loss of ATM does not impair HR, including H2AX-dependent HR, but confers sensitivity to inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases. Loss of ATM or H2AX has independent contributions to cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation. The ATM-independent HR function of H2AX requires both Ser-139 phosphorylation and \u03b3-H2AX/MDC1 interaction. Our data suggest that ATM is dispensable for HR, including that controlled by H2AX, in the context of euchromatin, excluding the implication of such an HR function in genomic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA damage, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition associated with ATM deficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Classical nonhomologous end joining (C-NHEJ) is a major mammalian DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway that is required for assembly of antigen receptor variable region gene segments by V(D)J recombination. Recombination activating gene endonuclease initiates V(D)J recombination by generating DSBs between two V(D)J coding gene segments and flanking recombination signal sequences (RS), with the two coding ends and two RS ends joined by C-NHEJ to form coding joins and signal joins, respectively. During C-NHEJ, recombination activating gene factor generates two coding ends as covalently sealed hairpins and RS ends as blunt 5'-phosphorylated DSBs. Opening and processing of coding end hairpins before joining by C-NHEJ requires the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). However, C-NHEJ of RS ends, which do not require processing, occurs relatively normally in the absence of DNA-PKcs. The XRCC4-like factor (XLF) is a C-NHEJ component that is not required for C-NHEJ of chromosomal signal joins or coding joins because of functional redundancy with ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase, a protein that also has some functional overlap with DNA-PKcs in this process. Here, we show that XLF has dramatic functional redundancy with DNA-PKcs in the V(D)J SJ joining process, which is nearly abrogated in their combined absence. Moreover, we show that XLF functionally overlaps with DNA-PKcs in normal mouse development, promotion of genomic stability in mouse fibroblasts, and in IgH class switch recombination in mature B cells. Our findings suggest that DNA-PKcs has fundamental roles in C-NHEJ processes beyond end processing that have been masked by functional overlaps with XLF.",

A-T patients and mouse models that express no ATM protein undergo normal embryonic development but exhibit pleiotropic DNA repair defects. In this paper, we report that mice carrying homozygous kinase-dead mutations in Atm (Atm(KD/KD)) died during early embryonic development. Atm(KD/-) cells exhibited proliferation defects and genomic instability, especially chromatid breaks, at levels higher than Atm(-/-) cells. Despite this increased genomic instability, Atm(KD/-) lymphocytes progressed through variable, diversity, and joining recombination and immunoglobulin class switch recombination, two events requiring nonhomologous end joining, at levels comparable to Atm(-/-) lymphocytes.

        "Abstract": "Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), a major pathway of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, is required during lymphocyte development to resolve the programmed DSBs generated during Variable, Diverse, and Joining [V(D)J] recombination. XRCC4-like factor (XLF) (also called Cernunnos or NHEJ1) is a unique component of the NHEJ pathway. Although germ-line mutations of other NHEJ factors abrogate lymphocyte development and lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), XLF mutations cause a progressive lymphocytopenia that is generally less severe than SCID. Accordingly, XLF-deficient murine lymphocytes show no measurable defects in V(D)J recombination. We reported earlier that ATM kinase and its substrate histone H2AX are both essential for V(D)J recombination in XLF-deficient lymphocytes, despite moderate role in V(D)J recombination in WT cells. p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) is another substrate of ATM. 53BP1 deficiency led to small reduction of peripheral lymphocyte number by compromising both synapse and end-joining at modest level during V(D)J recombination. Here, we report that 53BP1/XLF double deficiency blocks lymphocyte development at early progenitor stages, owing to severe defects in end joining during chromosomal V(D)J recombination. The unrepaired DNA ends are rapidly degraded in 53BP1(-/-)XLF(-/-) cells, as reported for H2AX(-/-)XLF(-/-) cells, revealing an end protection role for 53BP1 reminiscent of H2AX. In contrast to the early embryonic lethality of H2AX(-/-)XLF(-/-) mice, 53BP1(-/-)XLF(-/-) mice are born alive and develop thymic lymphomas with translocations involving the T-cell receptor loci. Together, our findings identify a unique function for 53BP1 in end-joining and tumor suppression.",

        "Title": "Robust chromosomal DNA repair via alternative end-joining in the absence of X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1 (XRCC1).",
        "Abstract": "Classical nonhomologous DNA end-joining (C-NHEJ), which is a major DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway in mammalian cells, plays a dominant role in joining DSBs during Ig heavy chain (IgH) class switch recombination (CSR) in activated B lymphocytes. However, in B cells deficient for one or more requisite C-NHEJ factors, such as DNA ligase 4 (Lig4) or XRCC4, end-joining during CSR occurs by a distinct alternative end-joining (A-EJ) pathway. A-EJ also has been implicated in joining DSBs found in oncogenic chromosomal translocations. DNA ligase 3 (Lig3) and its cofactor XRCC1 are widely considered to be requisite A-EJ factors, based on biochemical studies or extrachromosomal substrate end-joining studies. However, potential roles for these factors in A-EJ of endogenous chromosomal DSBs have not been tested. Here, we report that Xrcc1 inactivation via conditional gene-targeted deletion in WT or XRCC4-deficient primary B cells does not have an impact on either CSR or IgH/c-myc translocations in activated B lymphocytes. Indeed, homozygous deletion of Xrcc1 does not impair A-EJ of I-SceI-induced DSBs in XRCC4-deficient pro-B-cell lines. Correspondingly, substantial depletion of Lig3 in Lig4-deficient primary B cells or B-cell lines does not impair A-EJ of CSR-mediated DSBs or formation of IgH/c-myc translocations. Our findings firmly demonstrate that XRCC1 is not a requisite factor for A-EJ of chromosomal DSBs and raise the possibility that DNA ligase 1 (Lig1) may contribute more to A-EJ than previously considered.",

        "Abstract": "The BCL11B transcription factor is required for normal T-cell development, and has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) induced by TLX overexpression or Atm deficiency. To comprehensively assess the contribution of BCL11B inactivation to human T-ALL, we performed DNA copy number and sequencing analyses of T-ALL diagnostic specimens, revealing monoallelic BCL11B deletions or missense mutations in 9% (n = 10 of 117) of cases. Structural homology modeling revealed that several of the BCL11B mutations disrupted the structure of zinc finger domains required for this transcription factor to bind DNA. BCL11B haploinsufficiency occurred across each of the major molecular subtypes of T-ALL, including early T-cell precursor, HOXA-positive, LEF1-inactivated, and TAL1-positive subtypes, which have differentiation arrest at diverse stages of thymocyte development. Our findings provide compelling evidence that BCL11B is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor that collaborates with all major T-ALL oncogenic lesions in human thymocyte transformation.",

        "Abstract": "Antigen receptor variable region exons are assembled during lymphocyte development from variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments. Each germ-line gene segment is flanked by recombination signal sequences (RSs). Recombination-activating gene endonuclease initiates V(D)J recombination by cleaving a pair of gene segments at their junction with flanking RSs to generate covalently sealed (hairpinned) coding ends (CEs) and blunt 5'-phosphorylated RS ends (SEs). Subsequently, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) opens, processes, and fuses CEs to form coding joins (CJs) and precisely joins SEs to form signal joins (SJs). DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) activates Artemis endonuclease to open and process hairpinned CEs before their fusion into CJs by other NHEJ factors. Although DNA-PKcs is absolutely required for CJs, SJs are formed to variable degrees and with variable fidelity in different DNA-PKcs-deficient cell types. Thus, other factors may compensate for DNA-PKcs function in SJ formation. DNA-PKcs and the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase are members of the same family, and they share common substrates in the DNA damage response. Although ATM deficiency compromises chromosomal V(D)J CJ formation, it has no reported role in SJ formation in normal cells. Here, we report that DNA-PKcs and ATM have redundant functions in SJ formation. Thus, combined DNA-PKcs and ATM deficiency during V(D)J recombination leads to accumulation of unjoined SEs and lack of SJ fidelity. Moreover, treatment of DNA-PKcs- or ATM-deficient cells, respectively, with specific kinase inhibitors for ATM or DNA-PKcs recapitulates SJ defects, indicating that the overlapping V(D)J recombination functions of ATM and DNA-PKcs are mediated through their kinase activities.",

        "Abstract": "Classical non-homologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) is a major mammalian DNA double-strand-break (DSB) repair pathway. Deficiencies for classical NHEJ factors, such as XRCC4, abrogate lymphocyte development, owing to a strict requirement for classical NHEJ to join V(D)J recombination DSB intermediates. The XRCC4-like factor (XLF; also called NHEJ1) is mutated in certain immunodeficient human patients and has been implicated in classical NHEJ; however, XLF-deficient mice have relatively normal lymphocyte development and their lymphocytes support normal V(D)J recombination. The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein (ATM) detects DSBs and activates DSB responses by phosphorylating substrates including histone H2AX. However, ATM deficiency causes only modest V(D)J recombination and lymphocyte developmental defects, and H2AX deficiency does not have a measurable impact on these processes. Here we show that XLF, ATM and H2AX all have fundamental roles in processing and joining DNA ends during V(D)J recombination, but that these roles have been masked by unanticipated functional redundancies. Thus, combined deficiency of ATM and XLF nearly blocks mouse lymphocyte development due to an inability to process and join chromosomal V(D)J recombination DSB intermediates. Combined XLF and ATM deficiency also severely impairs classical NHEJ, but not alternative end-joining, during IgH class switch recombination. Redundant ATM and XLF functions in classical NHEJ are mediated by ATM kinase activity and are not required for extra-chromosomal V(D)J recombination, indicating a role for chromatin-associated ATM substrates. Correspondingly, conditional H2AX inactivation in XLF-deficient pro-B lines leads to V(D)J recombination defects associated with marked degradation of unjoined V(D)J ends, revealing that H2AX has a role in this process.",

        "Abstract": "Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) deficiency predisposes humans and mice to T lineage lymphomas with recurrent chromosome 14 translocations involving the T cell receptor alpha/delta (Tcra/d) locus. Such translocations have been thought to result from aberrant repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during Tcra locus V(D)J recombination, and to require the Tcra enhancer (Ealpha) for Tcra rearrangement or expression of the translocated oncogene. We now show that, in addition to the known chromosome 14 translocation, ATM-deficient mouse thymic lymphomas routinely contain a centromeric fragment of chromosome 14 that spans up to the 5' boundary of the Tcra/d locus, at which position a 500-kb or larger region centromeric to Tcra/d is routinely amplified. In addition, they routinely contain a large deletion of the telomeric end of one copy of chromosome 12. In contrast to prior expectations, the recurrent translocations and amplifications involve V(D)J recombination-initiated breaks in the Tcrd locus, as opposed to the Tcra locus, and arise independently of the Ealpha. Overall, our studies reveal previously unexpected mechanisms that contribute to the oncogenic transformation of ATM-deficient T lineage cells.",

        "Abstract": "DNA ligase IV (LIG4) is an essential component of the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway and plays a key role in V(D)J recombination. Hypomorphic LIG4 mutations in humans are associated with increased cellular radiosensitivity, microcephaly, facial dysmorphisms, growth retardation, developmental delay, and a variable degree of immunodeficiency. We have generated a knock-in mouse model with a homozygous Lig4 R278H mutation that corresponds to the first LIG4 mutation reported in humans. The phenotype of homozygous mutant mice Lig4(R278H/R278H) (Lig4(R/R)) includes growth retardation, a decreased life span, a severe cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and a very severe, but incomplete block in T and B cell development. Peripheral T lymphocytes show an activated and anergic phenotype, reduced viability, and a restricted repertoire, reminiscent of human leaky SCID. Genomic instability is associated with a high rate of thymic tumor development. Finally, Lig4(R/R) mice spontaneously produce low-affinity antibodies that include autoreactive specificities, but are unable to mount high-affinity antibody responses. These findings highlight the importance of LIG4 in lymphocyte development and function, and in genomic stability maintenance, and provide a model for the complex phenotype of LIG4 syndrome in humans.",

        "Abstract": "The DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair protein DNA-PKcs and the signal transducer ATM are both activated by DNA breaks and phosphorylate similar substrates in vitro, yet appear to have distinct functions in vivo. Here, we show that ATM and DNA-PKcs have overlapping functions in lymphocytes. Ablation of both kinase activities in cells undergoing immunoglobulin class switch recombination leads to a compound defect in switching and a synergistic increase in chromosomal fragmentation, DNA insertions, and translocations due to aberrant processing of DSBs. These abnormalities are attributed to a compound deficiency in phosphorylation of key proteins required for DNA repair, class switching, and cell death. Notably, both kinases are required for normal levels of p53 phosphorylation in B and T cells and p53-dependent apoptosis. Our experiments reveal a DNA-PKcs-dependent pathway that regulates DNA repair and activation of p53 in the absence of ATM.",

        "Abstract": "By genetically ablating IkappaB kinase (IKK)-mediated activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in the B cell lineage and by analyzing a mouse mutant in which immunoglobulin lambda-chain-positive B cells are generated in the absence of rearrangements in the locus encoding immunoglobulin kappa-chain, we define here two distinct, consecutive phases of early B cell development that differ in their dependence on IKK-mediated NF-kappaB signaling. During the first phase, in which NF-kappaB signaling is dispensable, predominantly kappa-chain-positive B cells are generated, which undergo efficient receptor editing. In the second phase, predominantly lambda-chain-positive B cells are generated whose development is ontogenetically timed to occur after rearrangements of the locus encoding kappa-chain. This second phase of development is dependent on NF-kappaB signals, which can be substituted by transgenic expression of the prosurvival factor Bcl-2.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in XLF/Cernunnos (XLF) cause lymphocytopenia in humans, and various studies suggest an XLF role in classical nonhomologous end joining (C-NHEJ). We now find that XLF-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts are ionizing radiation (IR) sensitive and severely impaired for ability to support V(D)J recombination. Yet mature lymphocyte numbers in XLF-deficient mice are only modestly decreased. Moreover, XLF-deficient pro-B lines, while IR-sensitive, perform V(D)J recombination at nearly wild-type levels. Correspondingly, XLF/p53-double-deficient mice are not markedly prone to the pro-B lymphomas that occur in previously characterized C-NHEJ/p53-deficient mice; however, like other C-NHEJ/p53-deficient mice, they still develop medulloblastomas. Despite nearly normal V(D)J recombination in developing B cells, XLF-deficient mature B cells are moderately defective for immunoglobulin heavy-chain class switch recombination. Together, our results implicate XLF as a C-NHEJ factor but also indicate that developing mouse lymphocytes harbor cell-type-specific factors/pathways that compensate for the absence of XLF function during V(D)J recombination.",

To elucidate further the potential overlapping and unique functions of ATM and H2AX, we asked whether they have synergistic functions in the development and maintenance of genomic stability by inactivating both genes in mouse germ line. Combined ATM/H2AX deficiency caused embryonic lethality and dramatic cellular genomic instability. Mechanistically, severe genomic instability in the double-deficient cells is associated with a requirement for H2AX to repair oxidative DNA damage resulting from ATM deficiency. We discuss these findings in the context of synergies between ATM and other repair factors.",

        "Title": "Defective DNA repair and increased genomic instability in Cernunnos-XLF-deficient murine ES cells.",
        "Abstract": "Nonhomologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) is a major pathway of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in mammalian cells, and it functions to join both specifically programmed DSBs that occur in the context of V(D)J recombination during early lymphocyte development as well as general DSBs that occur in all cells. Thus, defects in NHEJ impair V(D)J recombination and lead to general genomic instability. In human patients, mutations of Cernunnos-XLF (also called NHEJ1), a recently identified NHEJ factor, underlie certain severe combined immune deficiencies associated with defective V(D)J recombination and radiosensitivity. To characterize Cernunnos-XLF function in mouse cells, we used gene-targeted mutation to delete exons 4 and 5 from both copies of the Cernunnos-XLF gene in ES cell (referred to as Cer(Delta/Delta) ES cells). Analyses of Cer(Delta/Delta) ES cells showed that they produce no readily detectable Cernunnos-XLF protein. Based on transient V(D)J recombination assays, we find that Cer(Delta/Delta) ES cells have dramatic impairments in ability to form both V(D)J coding joins and joins of their flanking recombination signal sequences (RS joins). Cer(Delta/Delta) ES cells are highly sensitive to ionizing radiation and have intrinsic DNA DSB repair defects as measured by pulse field gel electrophoresis. Finally, the Cernunnos-XLF mutations led to increased spontaneous genomic instability, including translocations. We conclude that, in mice, Cernunnos-XLF is essential for normal NHEJ-mediated repair of DNA DSBs and that Cernunnos-XLF acts as a genomic caretaker to prevent genomic instability.",

        "Abstract": "Histone H2AX promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) class switch recombination (CSR) in B-lymphocytes. CSR requires activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and involves joining of DSB intermediates by end joining. We find that AID-dependent IgH locus chromosome breaks occur at high frequency in primary H2AX-deficient B cells activated for CSR and that a substantial proportion of these breaks participate in chromosomal translocations. Moreover, activated B cells deficient for ATM, 53BP1, or MDC1, which interact with H2AX during the DSB response, show similarly increased IgH locus breaks and translocations. Thus, our findings implicate a general role for these factors in promoting end joining and thereby preventing DSBs from progressing into chromosomal breaks and translocations. As cellular p53 status does not markedly influence the frequency of such events, our results also have implications for how p53 and the DSB response machinery cooperate to suppress generation of lymphomas with oncogenic translocations.",

        "Abstract": "Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), an enzyme involved in branched-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation that is normally expressed at high levels in human liver, is specifically and consistently overexpressed at both mRNA and protein levels in human prostate cancer and potentially other cancer types. To characterize the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of AMACR at the genetic and epigenetic levels, we performed a series of methylation and reporter assays in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. The results ruled out altered methylation patterns as the cause of overexpression in prostate cancer cells. However, promoter deletion analysis identified an 8-bp nonclassic CCAAT enhancer element located approximately 80 bp upstream of the transcriptional initiation site that is responsible for AMACR expression in both prostate cancer cell lines and cell lines of liver origin. Deletion or mutation of this element completely abolished AMACR promoter activity. Ectopic expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta increased luciferase activity driven by a wild-type AMACR promoter sequence but not by the sequence in which the putative CCAAT/enhancer binding protein binding element had been mutated. These results implicate a nonclassic CCAAT enhancer element in the AMACR gene promoter as playing a critical role in the regulation of AMACR gene expression.",

        "Abstract": "Overexpression of alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), an enzyme involved in branched chain fatty acid beta-oxidation, in prostate cancer has been reported. Here, we report that an enzyme downstream from AMACR in the peroxisomal branched chain fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway-D-bifunctional protein (DBP)-is also upregulated in prostate cancer at both mRNA and protein levels, accompanied by increased enzymatic activity. Furthermore, our data suggest that pristanoyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX3), which is expressed at extremely low level in other human organs studied including the liver, might contribute significantly to peroxisomal branched chain fatty acid beta-oxidation in human prostate tissue and some prostate cancer cell lines. In contrast to these results for peroxisomal enzymes, no significant expression changes of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation enzymes were observed in prostate cancer tissues through comprehensive quantitative RT-PCR screening. These data for the first time provide evidence for the selective over-activation of peroxisomal branched chain fatty acid beta-oxidation in prostate cancer, emphasizing a new metabolic change during prostate oncogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Aspirin has been used to control pain and inflammation for over a century. Epidemiological studies first associated a decreased incidence of colorectal cancer with the long-term use of aspirin in the early 1980s. Near the same time the first reports showing regression of colorectal adenomas in response to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) sulindac were reported. In subsequent years, the use of other NSAIDs, which inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, was linked to reduced cancer risk in multiple tissues including those of the breast, prostate, and lung. Together these studies resulted in the identification of a new cancer preventive and/or therapeutic target-COX enzymes, especially COX-2. Meanwhile, the overexpression of COX-2, and less consistently, the upstream and downstream enzymes of the prostaglandin synthesis pathway, was demonstrated in multiple cancer types and some pre-neoplastic lesions. Direct interactions of prostaglandins with their receptors through autocrine or paracrine pathways to enhance cellular survival or stimulate angiogenesis have been proposed as the molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-carcinogenic functions of COX-2. The rapid development of safe and effective inhibitors targeting individual COX enzymes not only dramatically improved our understanding of the function of COX-2, but also resulted in discovery of COX independent functions of NSAIDs, providing important hints for future drug design. Here we review the fundamental features of COX enzymes, especially as related to carcinogenesis, their expression and function in both animal tumor models and clinical cancers and the proposed mechanisms behind their roles in cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) is an enzyme involved in beta-oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids and bile acid intermediates. Recent work has identified AMACR as a new diagnostic marker for prostate cancer (PCa). The data from the present study suggest that AMACR is also functionally important for the growth of PCa cells. Overexpressed AMACR from both clinical tissues and PCa cell lines is wild type by sequence analysis and functionally active by enzymatic assay. Correspondingly, enzyme activity of AMACR increases approximately 4-fold in PCa in comparison with adjacent normal prostate. Small interference RNA (siRNA) against AMACR, but not the control inverted siRNA, reduced the expression of AMACR and significantly impaired proliferation of the androgen-responsive PCa cell line LAPC-4. No effect was observed in HeLaS3 cells, which express AMACR at a low level. Cell cycle analyses revealed a G(2)-M cell cycle arrest in LAPC-4 cells treated with siRNA compared with mock treatment or control inverted siRNA. Expression of a siRNA-resistant form of AMACR in LAPC-4 cells protects the cells from growth arrest after AMACR-specific siRNA treatment. Data from Western blotting and luciferase-based reporter assays suggest that the function and expression of AMACR are independent of androgen receptor-mediated signaling. Moreover, simultaneous inhibition of both the AMACR pathway by siRNA and androgen signaling by means of androgen withdrawal or antiandrogen suppressed the growth of LAPC-4 cells to a greater extent than either treatment alone. Taken together, these data suggest that AMACR is essential for optimal growth of PCa cells in vitro and that this enzyme has the potential to be a complementary target with androgen ablation in PCa treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Prostate cancer is among the most common malignancies. It is estimated that 1 in 6 men in the United States will be diagnosed with this disease. Despite the high prevalence and importance of prostate cancer, the molecular mechanisms underlying its development and progression remain poorly understood. This article reviews new information about the roles of oxidants and electrophiles in prostate cancer; the potential importance of chronic inflammation and atrophy in prostate carcinogenesis, and implications for chemoprevention; evidence supporting telomere shortening and genetic instability in the etiology of prostate cancer; and alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase (AMACR) as a potential marker for prostate carcinogenesis. These new results show that at least some high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PIN) and early adenocarcinomas appear to arise from proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA). Inflammation and other environmental factors may lead to the destruction of prostate epithelial cells, and increased proliferation may occur as a response to this cell death. Such proliferation may be mechanistically related to decreased p27(Kip1) observed in PIA. The decreased apoptosis associated with these events may also be related to increased expression of Bcl-2. Increased oxidant and electrophile stress in the setting of increased proliferation associated with these events may lead to elevated glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) expression as a genomic-protective measure. However, aberrant methylation of the CpG island of the GSTP1 gene promoter silences GSTP1 gene expression and protein levels, setting the stage for additional genetic damage and accelerated progression toward PIN and carcinoma. Additional results show that AMACR may be an important new marker of prostate cancer, and its use in combination with p63 staining may provide the basis for an improved method for identification of prostate cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Identification of genes that are dysregulated in association with prostate carcinogenesis can provide disease markers and clues relevant to disease etiology. Of particular interest as candidate markers of disease are those genes that are frequently overexpressed. In this study, we describe a gene, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), whose expression is consistently up-regulated in prostate cancer. Analysis of mRNA levels of AMACR revealed an average up-regulation of approximately 9 fold in clinical prostate cancer specimens compared with normal. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis confirms the up-regulation at the protein level and localizes the enzyme predominantly to the peroxisomal compartment of prostate cancer cells. A detailed immunohistochemical analysis of samples from 168 primary prostate cancer cases using both standard slides and tissue microarrays demonstrates that both prostate carcinomas and the presumed precursor lesion (high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) consistently scored significantly higher than matched normal prostate epithelium; 88% of the carcinomas had a staining score higher than the highest score observed for any sample of normal prostate epithelium. Both untreated metastases (n = 32 patients) and hormone refractory prostate cancers (n = 14 patients) were generally strongly positive for AMACR. To extend the utility of this marker for prostate cancer diagnosis, we combined staining for cytoplasmic AMACR with staining for the nuclear protein, p63, a basal cell marker in the prostate that is absent in prostate cancer. In a simple assay that can be useful for the diagnosis of prostate cancer on both biopsy and surgical specimens, combined staining for p63 and AMACR resulted in a staining pattern that greatly facilitated the identification of malignant prostate cells. The enzyme encoded by the AMACR gene plays a critical role in peroxisomal beta oxidation of branched chain fatty acid molecules. These observations could have important epidemiological and preventive implications for prostate cancer, as the main sources of branched chain fatty acids are dairy products and beef, the consumption of which has been associated with an increased risk for prostate cancer in multiple studies. On the basis of its consistency and magnitude of cancer cell-specific expression, we propose AMACR as an important new marker of prostate cancer and that its use in combination with p63 staining will form the basis for an improved staining method for the identification of prostate carcinomas. Furthermore, the absence of AMACR staining in the vast majority of normal tissues coupled with its enzymatic activity makes AMACR the ideal candidate for development of molecular probes for the noninvasive identification of prostate cancer by imaging modalities.",
