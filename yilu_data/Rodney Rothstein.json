        "Title": "Strand asymmetry in the repair of replication dependent double-strand breaks.",
        "Abstract": "Single-strand breaks (SSBs) are one of the most common endogenous lesions and have the potential to give rise to cytotoxic double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication. To investigate the mechanism of replication fork collapse at SSBs and subsequent repair, we employed Cas9 nickase (nCas9) to generate site and strand-specific nicks in the budding yeast genome. We show that nCas9-induced nicks are converted to mostly double-ended DSBs during S-phase. We find that repair of replication-dependent DSBs requires homologous recombination (HR) and is independent of canonical non-homologous end joining. Consistent with a strong bias to repair these lesions using a sister chromatid template, we observe minimal induction of inter-chromosomal HR by nCas9. Using nCas9 and a gRNA to nick either the leading or lagging strand template, we carried out a genome-wide screen to identify factors necessary for the repair of replication-dependent DSBs. All the core HR genes were recovered in the screen with both gRNAs, but we recovered components of the replication-coupled nucleosome assembly (RCNA) pathway with only the gRNA targeting the leading strand template. By use of additional gRNAs, we find that the RCNA pathway is especially important to repair a leading strand fork collapse.",

        "Abstract": "Pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGG) are devastating and incurable brain tumors with recurrent mutations in histone H3.3. These mutations promote oncogenesis by dysregulating gene expression through alterations of histone modifications. We identify aberrant DNA repair as an independent mechanism, which fosters genome instability in H3.3 mutant pHGG, and opens new therapeutic options. The two most frequent H3.3 mutations in pHGG, K27M and G34R, drive aberrant repair of replication-associated damage by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Aberrant NHEJ is mediated by the DNA repair enzyme polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), which shows increased association with mutant H3.3 at damaged replication forks. PNKP sustains the proliferation of cells bearing H3.3 mutations, thus conferring a molecular vulnerability, specific to mutant cells, with potential for therapeutic targeting.",

        "Abstract": "RNA-containing structures, including ribonucleotide insertions, DNA:RNA hybrids and R-loops, have recently emerged as critical players in the maintenance of genome integrity. Strikingly, different enzymatic activities classically involved in genome maintenance contribute to their generation, their processing into genotoxic or repair intermediates, or their removal. Here we review how this substrate promiscuity can account for the detrimental and beneficial impacts of RNA insertions during genome metabolism. We summarize how in vivo and in vitro experiments support the contribution of DNA polymerases and homologous recombination proteins in the formation of RNA-containing structures, and we discuss the role of DNA repair enzymes in their removal. The diversity of pathways that are thus affected by RNA insertions likely reflects the ancestral function of RNA molecules in genome maintenance and transmission.",

        "Abstract": "The precise organization of the genome inside the cell nucleus is vital to many cell functions including gene expression, cell division, and DNA repair. Here we describe a method to measure pairing of DNA loci during homologous recombination (HR) at a site-specific double-strand break (DSB) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This method utilizes a chromosome tagging system in diploid yeast cells to visualize both the DNA at the break site and the homologous DNA that serves as a repair template. DNA repair products are confirmed in parallel by genomic blot. This visualization method provides insight into the physical contact that occurs between homologous loci during HR and correlates physical interaction with the timing of DNA repair.",

        "Abstract": "The vast majority of eukaryotes possess two DNA recombinases: Rad51, which is ubiquitously expressed, and Dmc1, which is meiosis-specific. The evolutionary origins of this two-recombinase system remain poorly understood. Interestingly, Dmc1 can stabilize mismatch-containing base triplets, whereas Rad51 cannot. Here, we demonstrate that this difference can be attributed to three amino acids conserved only within the Dmc1 lineage of the Rad51/RecA family. Chimeric Rad51 mutants harboring Dmc1-specific amino acids gain the ability to stabilize heteroduplex DNA joints with mismatch-containing base triplets, whereas Dmc1 mutants with Rad51-specific amino acids lose this ability. Remarkably, RAD-51 from ",

        "Abstract": "The postreplication repair gene, HLTF, is often amplified and overexpressed in cancer. Here we model HLTF dysregulation through the functionally conserved Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog, RAD5. Genetic interaction profiling and landscape enrichment analysis of RAD5 overexpression (RAD5OE) reveals requirements for genes involved in recombination, crossover resolution, and DNA replication. While RAD5OE and rad5\u0394 both cause cisplatin sensitivity and share many genetic interactions, RAD5OE specifically requires crossover resolving genes and drives recombination in a region of repetitive DNA. Remarkably, RAD5OE induced recombination does not require other post-replication repair pathway members, or the PCNA modification sites involved in regulation of this pathway. Instead, the RAD5OE phenotype depends on a conserved domain necessary for binding 3' DNA ends. Analysis of DNA replication intermediates supports a model in which dysregulated Rad5 causes aberrant template switching at replication forks. The direct effect of Rad5 on replication forks in vivo, increased recombination, and cisplatin sensitivity predicts similar consequences for dysregulated HLTF in cancer.",

        "Abstract": "The yeast Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex has structural, signaling, and catalytic functions in the response to DNA damage. Xrs2, the eukaryotic-specific component of the complex, is required for nuclear import of Mre11 and Rad50 and to recruit the Tel1 kinase to damage sites. We show that nuclear-localized MR complex (Mre11-NLS) catalyzes homology-dependent repair without Xrs2, but MR cannot activate Tel1, and it fails to tether DSBs, resulting in\u00a0sensitivity to genotoxins, replisome instability, and increased gross chromosome rearrangements (GCRs). Fusing the Tel1 interaction domain from Xrs2 to Mre11-NLS is sufficient to restore telomere elongation and Tel1 signaling to Xrs2-deficient cells. Furthermore, Tel1 stabilizes Mre11-DNA association, and this stabilization function becomes important for DNA damage resistance in the absence of Xrs2. Enforcing Tel1 recruitment to the nuclear MR complex fully rescues end tethering and stalled replication fork stability, and suppresses GCRs, highlighting important roles for Xrs2 and Tel1 to ensure optimal MR activity.",

        "Abstract": "Standard CRISPR-mediated gene disruption strategies rely on Cas9-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we show that CRISPR-dependent base editing efficiently inactivates genes by precisely converting four codons (CAA, CAG, CGA, and TGG) into STOP codons without DSB formation. To facilitate gene inactivation by induction of STOP codons (iSTOP), we provide access to a database of over 3.4 million single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for iSTOP (sgSTOPs) targeting 97%-99% of genes in eight eukaryotic species, and we describe a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay that allows the rapid detection of iSTOP-mediated editing in cell populations and clones. To simplify the selection of sgSTOPs, our resource includes annotations for off-target propensity, percentage of isoforms targeted, prediction of nonsense-mediated decay, and restriction enzymes for RFLP analysis. Additionally, our database includes sgSTOPs that could be employed to precisely model over 32,000 cancer-associated nonsense mutations. Altogether, this work provides a comprehensive resource for DSB-free gene disruption by iSTOP.",

        "Abstract": "Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the most lethal DNA lesions, and a variety of pathways have evolved to manage their repair in a timely fashion. One such pathway is homologous recombination (HR), in which information from an undamaged donor site is used as a template for repair. Although many of the biochemical steps of HR are known, the physical movements of chromosomes that must underlie the pairing of homologous sequence during mitotic DSB repair have remained mysterious. Recently, several groups have begun to use a variety of genetic and cell biological tools to study this important question. These studies reveal that both damaged and undamaged loci increase the volume of the nuclear space that they explore after the formation of DSBs. This DSB-induced increase in chromosomal mobility is regulated by many of the same factors that are important during HR, such as ATR-dependent checkpoint activation and the recombinase Rad51, suggesting that this phenomenon may facilitate the search for homology. In this perspective, we review current research into the mobility of chromosomal loci during HR, as well as possible underlying mechanisms, and discuss the critical questions that remain to be answered. Although we focus primarily on recent studies in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, examples of experiments performed in higher eukaryotes are also included, which reveal that increased mobility of damaged loci is a process conserved throughout evolution.",

        "Title": "A Synthetic Dosage Lethal Genetic Interaction Between CKS1B and PLK1 Is Conserved in Yeast and Human Cancer Cells.",
        "Abstract": "The CKS1B gene located on chromosome 1q21 is frequently amplified in breast, lung, and liver cancers. CKS1B codes for a conserved regulatory subunit of cyclin-CDK complexes that function at multiple stages of cell cycle progression. We used a high throughput screening protocol to mimic cancer-related overexpression in a library of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants to identify genes whose functions become essential only when CKS1 is overexpressed, a synthetic dosage lethal (SDL) interaction. Mutations in multiple genes affecting mitotic entry and mitotic exit are highly enriched in the set of SDL interactions. The interactions between Cks1 and the mitotic entry checkpoint genes require the inhibitory activity of Swe1 on the yeast cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), Cdc28. In addition, the SDL interactions of overexpressed CKS1 with mutations in the mitotic exit network are suppressed by modulating expression of the CDK inhibitor Sic1. Mutation of the polo-like kinase Cdc5, which functions in both the mitotic entry and mitotic exit pathways, is lethal in combination with overexpressed CKS1 Therefore we investigated the effect of targeting the human Cdc5 ortholog, PLK1, in breast cancers with various expression levels of human CKS1B Growth inhibition by PLK1 knockdown correlates with increased CKS1B expression in published tumor cell data sets, and this correlation was confirmed using shRNAs against PLK1 in tumor cell lines. In addition, we overexpressed CKS1B in multiple cell lines and found increased sensitivity to PLK1 knockdown and PLK1 drug inhibition. Finally, combined inhibition of WEE1 and PLK1 results in less apoptosis than predicted based on an additive model of the individual inhibitors, showing an epistatic interaction and confirming a prediction of the yeast data. Thus, identification of a yeast SDL interaction uncovers conserved genetic interactions that can affect human cancer cell viability.",

        "Title": "Recombination-Mediated Telomere Maintenance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Is Not Dependent on the Shu Complex.",
        "Abstract": "In cells lacking telomerase, telomeres shorten progressively during each cell division due to incomplete end-replication. When the telomeres become very short, cells enter a state that blocks cell division, termed senescence. A subset of these cells can overcome senescence and maintain their telomeres using telomerase-independent mechanisms. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these cells are called 'survivors' and are dependent on Rad52-dependent homologous recombination and Pol32-dependent break-induced replication. There are two main types of survivors: type I and type II. The type I survivors require Rad51 and maintain telomeres by amplification of subtelomeric elements, while the type II survivors are Rad51-independent, but require the MRX complex and Sgs1 to amplify the C1-3A/TG1-3 telomeric sequences. Rad52, Pol32, Rad51, and Sgs1 are also important to prevent accelerated senescence, indicating that recombination processes are important at telomeres even before the formation of survivors. The Shu complex, which consists of Shu1, Shu2, Psy3, and Csm2, promotes Rad51-dependent homologous recombination and has been suggested to be important for break-induced replication. It also promotes the formation of recombination intermediates that are processed by the Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 complex, as mutations in the SHU genes can suppress various sgs1, top3, and rmi1 mutant phenotypes. Given the importance of recombination processes during senescence and survivor formation, and the involvement of the Shu complex in many of the same processes during DNA repair, we hypothesized that the Shu complex may also have functions at telomeres. Surprisingly, we find that this is not the case: the Shu complex does not affect the rate of senescence, does not influence survivor formation, and deletion of SHU1 does not suppress the rapid senescence and type II survivor formation defect of a telomerase-negative sgs1 mutant. Altogether, our data suggest that the Shu complex is not important for recombination processes at telomeres.",

Live cell fluorescence microscopy offers the opportunity to image individual recombination events in real time providing insight into the in vivo biochemistry of the involved proteins and DNA molecules as well as the cellular organization of the process of homologous recombination. Herein we review the cell biological aspects of mitotic homologous recombination with a focus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cells, but will also draw on findings from other experimental systems. Key topics of this review include the stoichiometry and dynamics of recombination complexes in vivo, the choreography of assembly and disassembly of recombination proteins at sites of DNA damage, the mobilization of damaged DNA during homology search, and the functional compartmentalization of the nucleus with respect to capacity of homologous recombination.",

Here we will discuss several models that have been proposed to explain the mechanism of mitotic recombination, the genes and proteins involved in various pathways, the genetic and physical assays used to discover and study these genes, and the roles of many of these proteins inside the cell.",

        "Abstract": "Rad54 is an ATP-driven translocase involved in the genome maintenance pathway of homologous recombination (HR). Although its activity has been implicated in several steps of HR, its exact role(s) at each step are still not fully understood. We have identified a new interaction between Rad54 and the replicative DNA clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). This interaction was only mildly weakened by the mutation of two key hydrophobic residues in the highly-conserved PCNA interaction motif (PIP-box) of Rad54 (Rad54-AA). Intriguingly, the rad54-AA mutant cells displayed sensitivity to DNA damage and showed HR defects similar to the null mutant, despite retaining its ability to interact with HR proteins and to be recruited to HR foci in vivo. We therefore surmised that the PCNA interaction might be impaired in vivo and was unable to promote repair synthesis during HR. Indeed, the Rad54-AA mutant was defective in primer extension at the MAT locus as well as in vitro, but additional biochemical analysis revealed that this mutant also had diminished ATPase activity and an inability to promote D-loop formation. Further mutational analysis of the putative PIP-box uncovered that other phenotypically relevant mutants in this domain also resulted in a loss of ATPase activity. Therefore, we have found that although Rad54 interacts with PCNA, the PIP-box motif likely plays only a minor role in stabilizing the PCNA interaction, and rather, this conserved domain is probably an extension of the ATPase domain III.",

        "Title": "Phosphorylation-regulated transitions in an oligomeric state control the activity of the Sae2 DNA repair enzyme.",
        "Abstract": "In the DNA damage response, many repair and signaling molecules mobilize rapidly at the sites of DNA double-strand breaks. This network of immediate responses is regulated at the level of posttranslational modifications that control the activation of DNA processing enzymes, protein kinases, and scaffold proteins to coordinate DNA repair and checkpoint signaling. Here we investigated the DNA damage-induced oligomeric transitions of the Sae2 protein, an important enzyme in the initiation of DNA double-strand break repair. Sae2 is a target of multiple phosphorylation events, which we identified and characterized in vivo in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both cell cycle-dependent and DNA damage-dependent phosphorylation sites in Sae2 are important for the survival of DNA damage, and the cell cycle-regulated modifications are required to prime the damage-dependent events. We found that Sae2 exists in the form of inactive oligomers that are transiently released into smaller active units by this series of phosphorylations. DNA damage also triggers removal of Sae2 through autophagy and proteasomal degradation, ensuring that active Sae2 is present only transiently in cells. Overall, this analysis provides evidence for a novel type of protein regulation where the activity of an enzyme is controlled dynamically by posttranslational modifications that regulate its solubility and oligomeric state.",

        "Abstract": "The RecQ helicase family is critical during DNA damage repair, and mutations in these proteins are associated with Bloom, Werner, or Rothmund-Thompson syndromes in humans, leading to cancer predisposition and/or premature aging. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutations in the RecQ homolog, SGS1, phenocopy many of the defects observed in the human syndromes. One challenge to studying RecQ helicases is that their disruption leads to a pleiotropic phenotype. Using yeast, we show that the separation-of-function allele of SGS1, sgs1-D664\u0394, has impaired activity at DNA ends, resulting in a resection processivity defect. Compromising Sgs1 resection function in the absence of the Sae2 nuclease causes slow growth, which is alleviated by making the DNA ends accessible to Exo1 nuclease. Furthermore, fluorescent microscopy studies reveal that, when Sgs1 resection activity is compromised in sae2\u0394 cells, Mre11 repair foci persist. We suggest a model where the role of Sgs1 in end resection along with Sae2 is important for removing Mre11 from DNA ends during repair.",

        "Abstract": "DNA organization and dynamics profoundly affect many biological processes such as gene regulation and DNA repair. In this review, we present the latest studies on DNA mobility in the context of DNA damage. Recent studies demonstrate that DNA mobility is dramatically increased in the presence of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As a consequence, chromosomes explore a larger nuclear volume, facilitating homologous pairing but also increasing the rate of ectopic recombination. Increased DNA dynamics is dependent on several homologous recombination (HR) proteins and we are just beginning to understand how chromosome dynamics is regulated after DNA damage.",

        "Title": "The Shu complex regulates Rad52 localization during rDNA repair.",
        "Abstract": "The Shu complex, consisting of Rad51 paralogues, is an important regulator of homologous recombination, an error-free DNA repair pathway. Consequently, when members of this complex are disrupted, cells exhibit a mutator phenotype, sensitivity to DNA damage reagents and increased gross chromosomal rearrangements. Previously, we found that the Shu complex plays an important role in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) recombination when the Upstream Activating Factor (UAF) protein Uaf30 is disrupted. UAF30 encodes a protein needed for rDNA transcription and when deleted, rDNA recombination increases and the rDNA expands in a Shu1-dependent manner. Here we find using the uaf30-sensitized background that the central DNA repair protein Rad52, which is normally excluded from the nucleolus, frequently overlaps with the rDNA. This close association of Rad52 with the rDNA is dependent upon Shu1 in a uaf30 mutant. Previously, it was shown that in the absence of Rad52 sumoylation, Rad52 foci mislocalize to the nucleolus. Interestingly, here we find that using the uaf30 sensitized background the ability to regulate Rad52 sumoylation is important for Shu1 dependent rDNA recombination as well as Rad52 close association with rDNA. Our results suggest that in the absence of UAF30, the Shu complex plays a central role in Rad52 rDNA localization as long as Rad52 can be sumoylated. This discrimination is important for rDNA copy number homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Genome-wide experiments often measure quantitative differences between treated and untreated cells to identify affected strains. For these studies, statistical models are typically used to determine significance cutoffs. We developed a method termed \"CLIK\" (Cutoff Linked to Interaction Knowledge) that overlays biological knowledge from the interactome on screen results to derive a cutoff. The method takes advantage of the fact that groups of functionally related interacting genes often respond similarly to experimental conditions and, thus, cluster in a ranked list of screen results. We applied CLIK analysis to five screens of the yeast gene disruption library and found that it defined a significance cutoff that differed from traditional statistics. Importantly, verification experiments revealed that the CLIK cutoff correlated with the position in the rank order where the rate of true positives drops off significantly. In addition, the gene sets defined by CLIK analysis often provide further biological perspectives. For example, applying CLIK analysis retrospectively to a screen for cisplatin sensitivity allowed us to identify the importance of the Hrq1 helicase in DNA crosslink repair. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of CLIK to determine optimal treatment conditions by analyzing genome-wide screens at multiple rapamycin concentrations. We show that CLIK is an extremely useful tool for evaluating screen quality, determining screen cutoffs, and comparing results between screens. Furthermore, because CLIK uses previously annotated interaction data to determine biologically informed cutoffs, it provides additional insights into screen results, which supplement traditional statistical approaches.",

        "Abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are harmful lesions that arise mainly during replication. The choice of the sister chromatid as the preferential repair template is critical for genome integrity, but the mechanisms that guarantee this choice are unknown. Here we identify new genes with a specific role in assuring the sister chromatid as the preferred repair template. Physical analyses of sister chromatid recombination (SCR) in 28 selected mutants that increase Rad52 foci and inter-homolog recombination uncovered 8 new genes required for SCR. These include the SUMO/Ub-SUMO protease Wss1, the stress-response proteins Bud27 and Pdr10, the ADA histone acetyl-transferase complex proteins Ahc1 and Ada2, as well as the Hst3 and Hst4 histone deacetylase and the Rtt109 histone acetyl-transferase genes, whose target is histone H3 Lysine 56 (H3K56). Importantly, we use mutations in H3K56 residue to A, R, and Q to reveal that H3K56 acetylation/deacetylation is critical to promote SCR as the major repair mechanism for replication-born DSBs. The same phenotype is observed for a particular class of rad52 alleles, represented by rad52-C180A, with a DSB repair defect but a spontaneous hyper-recombination phenotype. We propose that specific Rad52 residues, as well as the histone H3 acetylation/deacetylation state of chromatin and other specific factors, play an important role in identifying the sister as the choice template for the repair of replication-born DSBs. Our work demonstrates the existence of specific functions to guarantee SCR as the main repair event for replication-born DSBs that can occur by two pathways, one Rad51-dependent and the other Pol32-dependent. A dysfunction can lead to genome instability as manifested by high levels of homolog recombination and DSB accumulation.",

        "Title": "Telomere length homeostasis responds to changes in intracellular dNTP pools.",
        "Abstract": "Telomeres, the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes, shorten due to incomplete DNA replication and nucleolytic degradation. Cells counteract this shortening by employing a specialized reverse transcriptase called telomerase, which uses deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) to extend telomeres. Intracellular dNTP levels are tightly regulated, and perturbation of these levels is known to affect DNA synthesis. We examined whether altering the levels of the dNTP pools or changing the relative ratios of the four dNTPs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae would affect the length of the telomeres. Lowering dNTP levels leads to a modest shortening of telomeres, while increasing dNTP pools has no significant effect on telomere length. Strikingly, altering the ratio of the four dNTPs dramatically affects telomere length homeostasis, both positively and negatively. Specifically, we find that intracellular deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) levels positively correlate with both telomere length and telomerase nucleotide addition processivity in vivo. Our findings are consistent with in vitro data showing dGTP-dependent stimulation of telomerase activity in multiple organisms and suggest that telomerase activity is modulated in vivo by dGTP levels.",

        "Abstract": "Using a genome-wide screening approach, we have established the genetic requirements for proper telomere structure in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We uncovered 112 genes, many of which have not previously been implicated in telomere function, that are required to form a fold-back structure at chromosome ends. Among other biological processes, lysine deacetylation, through the Rpd3L, Rpd3S, and Hda1 complexes, emerged as being a critical regulator of telomere structure. The telomeric-bound protein, Rif2, was also found to promote a telomere fold-back through the recruitment of Rpd3L to telomeres. In the absence of Rpd3 function, telomeres have an increased susceptibility to nucleolytic degradation, telomere loss, and the initiation of premature senescence, suggesting that an Rpd3-mediated structure may have protective functions. Together these data reveal that multiple genetic pathways may directly or indirectly impinge on telomere structure, thus broadening the potential targets available to manipulate telomere function.",

        "Title": "ScreenTroll: a searchable database to compare genome-wide yeast screens.",
        "Abstract": "Systematic biological screens typically identify many genes or proteins that are implicated in a specific phenotype. However, deriving mechanistic insight from these screens typically involves focusing upon one or a few genes within the set in order to elucidate their precise role in producing the phenotype. To find these critical genes, researchers use a variety of tools to query the set of genes to uncover underlying common genetic or physical interactions or common functional annotations (e.g. gene ontology terms). Not only it is necessary to find previous screens containing genes in common with the new set, but also useful to easily access the individual manuscript or study that classified those genes. Unfortunately, no tool currently exists to facilitate this task. We have developed a web-based tool (ScreenTroll) that queries one or more genes against a database of systematic yeast screens. The software determines which genome-wide yeast screens also identified the queried gene(s) and the resulting screens are listed in an order based on the extent of the overlap between the queried gene(s) and the open reading frames (ORFs) characterized in each individual yeast screen. In a separate list, the corresponding ORFs that are found in both the queried set of genes and each individual genome-wide screen are displayed along with links to the relevant manuscript via NIH's PubMed database. ScreenTroll is useful for comparing a list of ORFs with genes identified in a wide array of published genome-wide screens. This comparison informs users whether any of their queried ORFs overlaps a previous study in the ScreenTroll database. By listing the manuscript of the published screen, users can read more about the phenotype associated with that study. Together, this information provides insight into the function of the queried genes and helps the user focus on a subset of them.",

        "Abstract": "Manganese is an essential trace element, whose intracellular levels need to be carefully regulated. Mn(2+) acts as a cofactor for many enzymes and excess of Mn(2+) is toxic. Alterations in Mn(2+) homeostasis affect metabolic functions and mutations in the human Mn(2+)/Ca(2+) transporter ATP2C1 have been linked to Hailey-Hailey disease. By deletion of the yeast orthologue PMR1 we have studied the impact of Mn(2+) on cell cycle progression and show that an excess of cytosolic Mn(2+) alters S-phase transit, induces transcriptional up-regulation of cell cycle regulators, bypasses the need for S-phase cell cycle checkpoints and predisposes to genomic instability. On the other hand, we find that depletion of the Golgi Mn(2+) pool requires a functional morphology checkpoint to avoid the formation of polyploid cells.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination, an essential process for preserving genomic integrity, uses intact homologous sequences to repair broken chromosomes. To explore the mechanism of homologous pairing in vivo, we tagged two homologous loci in diploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells and investigated their dynamic organization in the absence and presence of DNA damage. When neither locus is damaged, homologous loci occupy largely separate regions, exploring only 2.7% of the nuclear volume. Following the induction of a double-strand break, homologous loci co-localize ten times more often. The mobility of the cut chromosome markedly increases, allowing it to explore a nuclear volume that is more than ten times larger. Interestingly, the mobility of uncut chromosomes also increases, allowing them to explore a four times larger volume. We propose a model for homology search in which increased chromosome mobility facilitates homologous pairing. Finally, we find that the increase in DNA dynamics is dependent on early steps of homologous recombination.",

        "Abstract": "Vesicle budding from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) employs a cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis to regulate assembly of the COPII coat. We have identified a novel mutation (sec24-m11) in the cargo-binding subunit, Sec24p, that specifically impacts the GTP-dependent generation of vesicles in vitro. Using a high-throughput approach, we defined genetic interactions between sec24-m11 and a variety of trafficking components of the early secretory pathway, including the candidate COPII regulators, Sed4p and Sec16p. We defined a fragment of Sec16p that markedly inhibits the Sec23p- and Sec31p-stimulated GTPase activity of Sar1p, and demonstrated that the Sec24p-m11 mutation diminished this inhibitory activity, likely by perturbing the interaction of Sec24p with Sec16p. The consequence of the heightened GTPase activity when Sec24p-m11 is present is the generation of smaller vesicles, leading to accumulation of ER membranes and more stable ER exit sites. We propose that association of Sec24p with Sec16p creates a novel regulatory complex that retards the GTPase activity of the COPII coat to prevent premature vesicle scission, pointing to a fundamental role for GTP hydrolysis in vesicle release rather than in coat assembly/disassembly.",

        "Abstract": "Srs2 is a 3'-5' DNA helicase that regulates many aspects of DNA metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is best known for its ability to counteract homologous recombination by dismantling Rad51 filaments, but is also involved in checkpoint activation, adaptation and recovery, and in resolution of late recombination intermediates. To further address its biological roles and uncover new genetic interactions, we examined the consequences of overexpressing SRS2 as well as two helicase-dead mutants, srs2-K41A and srs2-K41R, in the collection of 4827 yeast haploid deletion mutants. We identified 274 genes affecting a large variety of cellular functions that are required for cell growth when SRS2 or its mutants are overexpressed. Further analysis of these interactions reveals that Srs2 acts independently of its helicase function at replication forks likely through its recruitment by the sumoylated PCNA replication clamp. This helicase-independent function is responsible for the negative interactions with DNA metabolism genes and for the toxicity of SRS2 overexpression in many of the diverse cellular pathways revealed in our screens.",

        "Abstract": "Most human somatic cells do not express telomerase. Consequently, with each cell division their telomeres progressively shorten until replicative senescence is induced. Around 15% of human cancers maintain their telomeres using telomerase-independent, recombination-based mechanisms that are collectively termed 'alternative lengthening of telomeres' (ALT). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ALT cells are referred to as 'survivors'. One type of survivor (type II) resembles human ALT cells in that both are defined by the amplification of telomeric repeats. We analyzed recombination-mediated telomere extension events at individual telomeres in telomerase-negative yeast during the formation of type II survivors and found that long telomeres were preferentially extended. Furthermore, senescent cells with long telomeres were more efficient at bypassing senescence by the type II pathway. We speculate that telomere length may be important in determining whether cancer cells use telomerase or ALT to bypass replicative senescence.",

        "Abstract": "The Shu complex, which contains RAD51 paralogues, is involved in the decision between homologous recombination and error-prone repair. We discovered a link to ribosomal DNA (rDNA) recombination when we found an interaction between one member of the Shu complex, SHU1, and UAF30, a component of the upstream activating factor complex (UAF), which regulates rDNA transcription. In the absence of Uaf30, rDNA copy number increases, and this increase depends on several functional subunits of the Shu complex. Furthermore, in the absence of Uaf30, we find that Shu1 and Srs2, an anti-recombinase DNA helicase with which the Shu complex physically interacts, act in the same pathway regulating rDNA recombination. In addition, Shu1 modulates Srs2 recruitment to both induced and spontaneous foci correlating with a decrease in Rad51 foci, demonstrating that the Shu complex is an important regulator of Srs2 activity. Last, we show that Shu1 regulation of Srs2 to double-strand breaks is not restricted to the rDNA, indicating a more general function for the Shu complex in the regulation of Srs2. We propose that the Shu complex shifts the balance of repair toward Rad51 filament stabilization by inhibiting the disassembly reaction of Srs2.",

        "Title": "HDACs link the DNA damage response, processing of double-strand breaks and autophagy.",
        "Abstract": "Protein acetylation is mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs), which influence chromatin dynamics, protein turnover and the DNA damage response. ATM and ATR mediate DNA damage checkpoints by sensing double-strand breaks and single-strand-DNA-RFA nucleofilaments, respectively. However, it is unclear how acetylation modulates the DNA damage response. Here we show that HDAC inhibition/ablation specifically counteracts yeast Mec1 (orthologue of human ATR) activation, double-strand-break processing and single-strand-DNA-RFA nucleofilament formation. Moreover, the recombination protein Sae2 (human CtIP) is acetylated and degraded after HDAC inhibition. Two HDACs, Hda1 and Rpd3, and one HAT, Gcn5, have key roles in these processes. We also find that HDAC inhibition triggers Sae2 degradation by promoting autophagy that affects the DNA damage sensitivity of hda1 and rpd3 mutants. Rapamycin, which stimulates autophagy by inhibiting Tor, also causes Sae2 degradation. We propose that Rpd3, Hda1 and Gcn5 control chromosome stability by coordinating the ATR checkpoint and double-strand-break processing with autophagy.",

        "Abstract": "We have streamlined the process of transferring plasmids into any yeast strain library by developing a novel mating-based, high-throughput method called selective ploidy ablation (SPA). SPA uses a universal plasmid donor strain that contains conditional centromeres on every chromosome. The plasmid-bearing donor is mated to a recipient, followed by removal of all donor-strain chromosomes, producing a haploid strain containing the transferred plasmid. As proof of principle, we used SPA to transfer plasmids containing wild-type and mutant alleles of DNA topoisomerase I (TOP1) into the haploid yeast gene-disruption library. Overexpression of Top1 identified only one sensitive mutation, rpa34, while overexpression of top1-T(722)A allele, a camptothecin mimetic, identified 190 sensitive gene-disruption strains along with rpa34. In addition to known camptothecin-sensitive strains, this set contained mutations in genes involved in the Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex, the kinetochore, and vesicle trafficking. We further show that mutations in several ESCRT vesicle trafficking components increase Top1 levels, which is dependent on SUMO modification. These findings demonstrate the utility of the SPA technique to introduce plasmids into the haploid gene-disruption library to discover new interacting pathways.",

        "Abstract": "Regulation of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is important for cell survival and genome integrity in the face of genotoxic stress. The Mec1/Rad53/Dun1 DNA damage response kinase cascade exhibits multifaceted controls over RNR activity including the regulation of the RNR inhibitor, Sml1. After DNA damage, Sml1 is degraded leading to the up-regulation of dNTP pools by RNR. Here, we probe the requirements for Sml1 degradation and identify several sites required for in vivo phosphorylation and degradation of Sml1 in response to DNA damage. Further, in a strain containing a mutation in Rnr1, rnr1-W688G, mutation of these sites in Sml1 causes lethality. Degradation of Sml1 is dependent on the 26S proteasome. We also show that degradation of phosphorylated Sml1 is dependent on the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Rad6, the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ubr2, and the E2/E3-interacting protein, Mub1, which form a complex previously only implicated in the ubiquitylation of Rpn4.",

        "Abstract": "Regulation of the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination is extremely important for both cell viability and the maintenance of genomic integrity. Modulation of double-strand break repair in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves controlling the recruitment of one of the central recombination proteins, Rad52, to sites of DNA lesions. The Rad52 protein, which plays a role in strand exchange and the annealing of single strand DNA, is positively regulated upon entry into S phase, repressed during the intra-S phase checkpoint, and undergoes posttranslational modification events such as phosphorylation and sumoylation. These processes all contribute to the timing of Rad52 recruitment, its stability and function. Here, we summarize the regulatory events affecting the Rad52 protein and discuss how this regulation impacts DNA repair and cell survival.",

        "Abstract": "The yeast deletion library is a collection of over 5100 single gene deletions that has been widely used by the yeast community. The presence of a non-Mendelian element, such as a prion, within this library could affect the outcome of many large-scale genomic studies. We previously showed that the deletion library parent strain contained the [PIN(+)] prion. [PIN(+)] is the misfolded infectious prion form of the Rnq1 protein that displays distinct fluorescent foci in the presence of RNQ1-GFP and exists in different physical conformations, called variants. Here, we show that over 97% of the library deletion strains are [PIN(+)]. Of the 141 remaining strains that have completely (58) or partially (83) lost [PIN(+)], 139 deletions were able to efficiently maintain three different [PIN(+)] variants despite extensive growth and storage at 4 degrees C. One strain, cue2Delta, displayed an alteration in the RNQ1-GFP fluorescent shape, but the Rnq1p prion aggregate shows no biochemical differences from the wild-type. Only strains containing a deletion of either HSP104 or RNQ1 are unable to maintain [PIN(+)], indicating that 5153 non-essential genes are not required for [PIN(+)] propagation.",

        "Abstract": "Spontaneous mitotic recombination is a potential source of genetic changes such as loss of heterozygosity and chromosome translocations, which may lead to genetic disease. In this study we have used a rad52 hyper-recombination mutant, rad52-Y66A, to investigate the process of spontaneous heteroallelic recombination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that spontaneous recombination has different genetic requirements, depending on whether the recombination event occurs between chromosomes or between chromosome and plasmid sequences. The hyper-recombination phenotype of the rad52-Y66A mutation is epistatic with deletion of MRE11, which is required for establishment of DNA damage-induced cohesion. Moreover, single-cell analysis of strains expressing YFP-tagged Rad52-Y66A reveals a close to wild-type frequency of focus formation, but with foci lasting 6 times longer. This result suggests that spontaneous DNA lesions that require recombinational repair occur at the same frequency in wild-type and rad52-Y66A cells, but that the recombination process is slow in rad52-Y66A cells. Taken together, we propose that the slow recombinational DNA repair in the rad52-Y66A mutant leads to a by-pass of the window-of-opportunity for sister chromatid recombination normally promoted by MRE11-dependent damage-induced cohesion thereby causing a shift towards interchromosomal recombination.",

        "Abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad52 protein promotes homologous recombination by nucleating the Rad51 recombinase onto replication protein A-coated single-stranded DNA strands and also by directly annealing such strands. We show that the purified rad52-R70A mutant protein, with a compromised amino-terminal DNA binding domain, is capable of Rad51 delivery to DNA but is deficient in DNA annealing. Results from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments find that rad52-R70A associates with DNA double-strand breaks and promotes recruitment of Rad51 as efficiently as wild-type Rad52. Analysis of gene conversion intermediates reveals that rad52-R70A cells can mediate DNA strand invasion but are unable to complete the recombination event. These results provide evidence that DNA binding by the evolutionarily conserved amino terminus of Rad52 is needed for the capture of the second DNA end during homologous recombination.",

        "Abstract": "In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Rad1-Rad10 protein complex participates in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and homologous recombination (HR). During HR, the Rad1-Rad10 endonuclease cleaves 3' branches of DNA and aberrant 3' DNA ends that are refractory to other 3' processing enzymes. Here we show that yeast strains expressing fluorescently labeled Rad10 protein (Rad10-YFP) form foci in response to double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by a site-specific restriction enzyme, I-SceI or by ionizing radiation (IR). Additionally, for endonuclease-induced DSBs, Rad10-YFP localization to DSB sites depends on both RAD51 and RAD52, but not MRE11 while IR-induced breaks do not require RAD51. Finally, Rad10-YFP colocalizes with Rad51-CFP and with Rad52-CFP at DSB sites, indicating a temporal overlap of Rad52, Rad51 and Rad10 functions at DSBs. These observations are consistent with a putative role of Rad10 protein in excising overhanging DNA ends after homology searching and refine the potential role(s) of the Rad1-Rad10 complex in DSB repair in yeast.",

        "Abstract": "Pif1, an evolutionarily conserved helicase, negatively regulates telomere length by removing telomerase from chromosome ends. Pif1 has also been implicated in DNA replication processes such as Okazaki fragment maturation and replication fork pausing. We find that overexpression of Saccharomyces cervisiae PIF1 results in dose-dependent growth inhibition. Strong overexpression causes relocalization of the DNA damage response factors Rfa1 and Mre11 into nuclear foci and activation of the Rad53 DNA damage checkpoint kinase, indicating that the toxicity is caused by accumulation of DNA damage. We screened the complete set of approximately 4800 haploid gene deletion mutants and found that moderate overexpression of PIF1, which is only mildly toxic on its own, causes growth defects in strains with mutations in genes involved in DNA replication and the DNA damage response. Interestingly, we find that telomerase-deficient strains are also sensitive to PIF1 overexpression. Our data are consistent with a model whereby increased levels of Pif1 interfere with DNA replication, causing collapsed replication forks. At chromosome ends, collapsed forks result in truncated telomeres that must be rapidly elongated by telomerase to maintain viability.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR), although an important DNA repair mechanism, is dangerous to the cell if improperly regulated. The Srs2 \"anti-recombinase\" restricts HR by disassembling the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament, an intermediate preceding the exchange of homologous DNA strands. Here, we cytologically characterize Srs2 function in vivo and describe a novel mechanism for regulating the initiation of HR. We find that Srs2 is recruited separately to replication and repair centers and identify the genetic requirements for recruitment. In the absence of Srs2 activity, Rad51 foci accumulate, and surprisingly, can form in the absence of Rad52 mediation. However, these Rad51 foci do not represent repair-proficient filaments, as determined by recombination assays. Antagonistic roles for Rad52 and Srs2 in Rad51 filament formation are also observed in vitro. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Srs2 removes Rad51 indiscriminately from DNA, while the Rad52 protein coordinates appropriate filament reformation. This constant breakdown and rebuilding of filaments may act as a stringent quality control mechanism during HR.",

        "Abstract": "Genome integrity is frequently challenged by DNA lesions from both endogenous and exogenous sources. A single DNA double-strand break (DSB) is lethal if unrepaired and may lead to loss of heterozygosity, mutations, deletions, genomic rearrangements and chromosome loss if repaired improperly. Such genetic alterations are the main causes of cancer and other genetic diseases. Consequently, DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) is an important process in all living organisms. DSBR is also the driving mechanism in most strategies of gene targeting, which has applications in both genetic and clinical research. Here we review the cell biological response to DSBs in mitotically growing cells with an emphasis on homologous recombination pathways in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in mammalian cells.",

        "Abstract": "Asymmetric cell division is of fundamental importance in biology as it allows for the establishment of separate cell lineages during the development of multicellular organisms. Although microbial systems, including the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are excellent models of asymmetric cell division, this phenotype occurs in all cell divisions; consequently, models of lineage-specific segregation patterns in these systems do not exist. Here, we report the first example of lineage-specific asymmetric division in yeast. We used fluorescent tags to show that components of the yeast kinetochore, the protein complex that anchors chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, divide asymmetrically in a single postmeiotic lineage. This phenotype is not seen in vegetatively dividing haploid or diploid cells. This kinetochore asymmetry suggests a mechanism for the selective segregation of sister centromeres to daughter cells to establish different cell lineages or fates. These results provide a mechanistic link between lineage-defining asymmetry of metazoa with unicellular eukaryotes.",

        "Abstract": "Recruitment of the homologous recombination machinery to sites of double-strand breaks is a cell cycle-regulated event requiring entry into S phase and CDK1 activity. Here, we demonstrate that the central recombination protein, Rad52, forms foci independent of DNA replication, and its recruitment requires B-type cyclin/CDK1 activity. Induction of the intra-S-phase checkpoint by hydroxyurea (HU) inhibits Rad52 focus formation in response to ionizing radiation. This inhibition is dependent upon Mec1/Tel1 kinase activity, as HU-treated cells form Rad52 foci in the presence of the PI3 kinase inhibitor caffeine. These Rad52 foci colocalize with foci formed by the replication clamp PCNA. These results indicate that Mec1 activity inhibits the recruitment of Rad52 to both sites of DNA damage and stalled replication forks during the intra-S-phase checkpoint. We propose that B-type cyclins promote the recruitment of Rad52 to sites of DNA damage, whereas Mec1 inhibits spurious recombination at stalled replication forks.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in human homologues of the bacterial RecQ helicase cause diseases leading to cancer predisposition and/or shortened lifespan (Werner, Bloom, and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes). The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has one RecQ helicase, Sgs1, which functions with Top3 and Rmi1 in DNA repair. Here, we report separation-of-function alleles of SGS1 that suppress the slow growth of top3Delta and rmi1Delta cells similar to an SGS1 deletion, but are resistant to DNA damage similar to wild-type SGS1. In one allele, the second acidic region is deleted, and in the other, only a single aspartic acid residue 664 is deleted. sgs1-D664Delta, unlike sgs1Delta, neither disrupts DNA recombination nor has synthetic growth defects when combined with DNA repair mutants. However, during S phase, it accumulates replication-associated X-shaped structures at damaged replication forks. Furthermore, fluorescent microscopy reveals that the sgs1-D664Delta allele exhibits increased spontaneous RPA foci, suggesting that the persistent X-structures may contain single-stranded DNA. Taken together, these results suggest that the Sgs1 function in repair of DNA replication intermediates can be uncoupled from its role in homologous recombinational repair.",

        "Title": "Cooperativity of Mus81.Mms4 with Rad54 in the resolution of recombination and replication intermediates.",
        "Abstract": "The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mus81.Mms4 protein complex, a DNA structure-specific endonuclease, helps preserve genomic integrity by resolving pathological DNA structures that arise from damaged or aborted replication forks and may also play a role in the resolution of DNA intermediates arising through homologous recombination. Previous yeast two-hybrid studies have found an interaction of the Mus81 protein with Rad54, a Swi2/Snf2-like factor that serves multiple roles in homologous recombination processes. However, the functional significance of this novel interaction remains unknown. Here, using highly purified S. cerevisiae proteins, we show that Rad54 strongly stimulates the Mus81.Mms4 nuclease activity on a broad range of DNA substrates. This nuclease enhancement does not require ATP binding nor its hydrolysis by Rad54. We present evidence that Rad54 acts by targeting the Mus81.Mms4 complex to its DNA substrates. In addition, we demonstrate that the Rad54-mediated enhancement of the Mus81.Mms4 (Eme1) nuclease function is evolutionarily conserved. We propose that Mus81.Mms4 together with Rad54 efficiently process perturbed replication forks to promote recovery and may constitute an alternative mechanism to the resolution/dissolution of the recombination intermediates by Sgs1.Top3. These findings provide functional insights into the biological importance of the higher order complex of Mus81.Mms4 or its orthologue with Rad54.",

        "Abstract": "We have created a resource to rapidly map genetic traits to specific chromosomes in yeast. This mapping is done using a set of 16 yeast strains each containing a different chromosome with a conditionally functional centromere. Conditional centromere function is achieved by integration of a GAL1 promoter in cis to centromere sequences. We show that the 16 yeast chromosomes can be individually lost in diploid strains, which become hemizygous for the destabilized chromosome. Interestingly, most 2n - 1 strains endoduplicate and become 2n. We also demonstrate how chromosome loss in this set of strains can be used to map both recessive and dominant markers to specific chromosomes. In addition, we show that this method can be used to rapidly validate gene assignments from screens of strain libraries such as the yeast gene disruption collection.",

        "Abstract": "Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are potentially lethal DNA lesions that can be repaired by either homologous recombination (HR) or nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). We show that DSBs induced by ionizing radiation (IR) are efficiently processed for HR and bound by Rfa1 during G1, while endonuclease-induced breaks are recognized by Rfa1 only after the cell enters S phase. This difference is dependent on the DNA end-binding Yku70/Yku80 complex. Cell-cycle regulation is also observed in the DNA damage checkpoint response. Specifically, the 9-1-1 complex is required in G1 cells to recruit the Ddc2 checkpoint protein to damaged DNA, while, upon entry into S phase, the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 and the 9-1-1 complex both serve to recruit Ddc2 to foci. Together, these results demonstrate that the DNA repair machinery distinguishes between different types of damage in G1, which translates into different modes of checkpoint activation in G1 and S/G2 cells.",

        "Abstract": "DNA ends pose specific problems in the control of genetic information quality. Ends of broken DNA need to be rejoined to avoid genome rearrangements, whereas natural DNA ends of linear chromosomes, telomeres, need to be stable and hidden from the DNA damage response. Efficient DNA end metabolism, either at induced DNA breaks or telomeres, does not result from the machine-like precision of molecular reactions, but rather from messier, more stochastic processes. The necessary molecular interactions are dynamically unstable, with constructive and destructive processes occurring in competition. In the end, quality control comes from the constant building up and tearing down of inappropriate, but also appropriate reaction steps in combination with factors that only slightly shift the equilibrium to eventually favour appropriate events. Thus, paradoxically, enzymes antagonizing DNA end metabolism help to ensure that genome maintenance becomes a robust process.",

        "Title": "The genetic consequences of ablating helicase activity and the Top3 interaction domain of Sgs1.",
        "Abstract": "Sgs1, the RecQ helicase homolog, and Top3, the type-IA topoisomerase, physically interact and are required for genomic stability in budding yeast. Similarly, topoisomerase III genes physically pair with homologs of SGS1 in humans that are involved in the cancer predisposition and premature aging diseases Bloom, Werner, and Rothmund-Thompson syndromes. In the absence of Top1 activity, sgs1 mutants are severely growth impaired. Here, we investigate the role of Sgs1 helicase activity and its N-terminal Top3 interaction domain by using an allele-replacement technique to integrate mutant alleles at the native SGS1 genomic locus. We compare the phenotype of helicase-defective (sgs1-hd) and N-terminal deletion (sgs1-NDelta) strains to wild-type and sgs1 null strains. Like the sgs1 null, sgs1-hd mutations suppress top3 slow growth, cause a growth defect in the absence of Srs2 helicase, and impair meiosis. However, for recombination and the synthetic interaction with top1Delta mutations, loss of helicase activity exhibits a less severe phenotype than the null. Interestingly, deletion of the Top3 interaction domain of Sgs1 causes a top3-like phenotype, and furthermore, this effect is dependent on helicase activity. These results suggest that the protein-protein interaction between these two DNA-metabolism enzymes, even in the absence of helicase activity, is important for their function in catalyzing specific changes in DNA topology.",

        "Abstract": "To investigate the DNA damage response, we undertook a genome-wide study in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified 86 gene deletions that lead to increased levels of spontaneous Rad52 foci in proliferating diploid cells. More than half of the genes are conserved across species ranging from yeast to humans. Along with genes involved in DNA replication, repair, and chromatin remodeling, we found 22 previously uncharacterized open reading frames. Analysis of recombination rates and synthetic genetic interactions with rad52Delta suggests that multiple mechanisms are responsible for elevated levels of spontaneous Rad52 foci, including increased production of recombinogenic lesions, sister chromatid recombination defects, and improper focus assembly/disassembly. Our cell biological approach demonstrates the diversity of processes that converge on homologous recombination, protect against spontaneous DNA damage, and facilitate efficient repair.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that the MYB oncogene is frequently duplicated in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We find that the human MYB locus is flanked by 257-bp Alu repeats and that the duplication is mediated somatically by homologous recombination between the flanking Alu elements on sister chromatids. Nested long-range PCR analysis indicated a low frequency of homologous recombination leading to MYB tandem duplication in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of approximately 50% of healthy individuals, none of whom had a MYB duplication in the germline. We conclude that Alu-mediated MYB tandem duplication occurs at low frequency during normal thymocyte development and is clonally selected during the molecular pathogenesis of human T-ALL.",

This protein is multifunctional and contains several domains that allow it to interact with DNA as well as with different repair proteins. However, it has been unclear how Rad52 enters the nucleus. In the present study, we have used a combination of mutagenesis and sequence analysis to show that Rad52 from S. cerevisiae contains a single functional pat7 type NLS essential for its nuclear localization. The region containing the NLS seems only to be involved in nuclear transport as it plays no role in repair of MMS-induced DNA damage. The NLS in Rad52 is weak, as monomeric protein species that harbor this NLS are mainly located in the cytosol. In contrast, multimeric protein complexes wherein each subunit contains a single NLS(Rad52) sort efficiently to the nucleus. Based on the results we propose a model where the additive effect of multiple NLS(Rad52) sequences in a Rad52 ring-structure ensures efficient nuclear localization of Rad52.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is crucial for maintaining genome integrity by repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and rescuing collapsed replication forks. In contrast, uncontrolled HR can lead to chromosome translocations, loss of heterozygosity, and deletion of repetitive sequences. Controlled HR is particularly important for the preservation of repetitive sequences of the ribosomal gene (rDNA) cluster. Here we show that recombinational repair of a DSB in rDNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves the transient relocalization of the lesion to associate with the recombination machinery at an extranucleolar site. The nucleolar exclusion of Rad52 recombination foci entails Mre11 and Smc5-Smc6 complexes and depends on Rad52 SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) modification. Remarkably, mutations that abrogate these activities result in the formation of Rad52 foci within the nucleolus and cause rDNA hyperrecombination and the excision of extrachromosomal rDNA circles. Our study also suggests a key role of sumoylation for nucleolar dynamics, perhaps in the compartmentalization of nuclear activities.",

        "Abstract": "Recombination is important for repairing DNA lesions, yet it can also lead to genomic rearrangements. This process must be regulated, and recently, sumoylation-mediated mechanisms were found to inhibit Rad51-dependent recombination. Here, we report that the absence of the Slx5-Slx8 complex, a newly identified player in the SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) pathway, led to increased Rad51-dependent and Rad51-independent recombination. The increases were most striking during S phase, suggesting an accumulation of DNA lesions during replication. Consistent with this view, Slx8 protein localized to replication centers. In addition, like SUMO E2 mutants, slx8Delta mutants exhibited clonal lethality, which was due to the overamplification of 2 microm, an extrachromosomal plasmid. Interestingly, in both SUMO E2 and slx8Delta mutants, clonal lethality was rescued by deleting genes required for Rad51-independent recombination but not those involved in Rad51-dependent events. These results suggest that sumoylation negatively regulates Rad51-independent recombination, and indeed, the Slx5-Slx8 complex affected the sumoylation of several enzymes involved in early steps of Rad51-independent recombination. We propose that, during replication, the Slx5-Slx8 complex helps prevent DNA lesions that are acted upon by recombination. In addition, the complex inhibits Rad51-independent recombination via modulating the sumoylation of DNA repair proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is a source of genomic instability and the loss of heterozygosity in mitotic cells. Since these events pose a severe health risk, it is important to understand the molecular events that cause spontaneous HR. In eukaryotes, high levels of HR are a normal feature of meiosis and result from the induction of a large number of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). By analogy, it is generally believed that the rare spontaneous mitotic HR events are due to repair of DNA DSBs that accidentally occur during mitotic growth. Here we provide the first direct evidence that most spontaneous mitotic HR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is initiated by DNA lesions other than DSBs. Specifically, we describe a class of rad52 mutants that are fully proficient in inter- and intra-chromosomal mitotic HR, yet at the same time fail to repair DNA DSBs. The conclusions are drawn from genetic analyses, evaluation of the consequences of DSB repair failure at the DNA level, and examination of the cellular re-localization of Rad51 and mutant Rad52 proteins after introduction of specific DSBs. In further support of our conclusions, we show that, as in wild-type strains, UV-irradiation induces HR in these rad52 mutants, supporting the view that DNA nicks and single-stranded gaps, rather than DSBs, are major sources of spontaneous HR in mitotic yeast cells.",

        "Abstract": "We have developed a new method, systematic hybrid loss of heterozygosity, to facilitate genomic screens utilizing the yeast gene deletion library. Screening is performed using hybrid diploid strains produced through mating the library haploids with strains from a different genetic background, to minimize the contribution of unpredicted recessive genetic factors present in the individual library strains. We utilize a set of strains where each contains a conditional centromere construct on one of the 16 yeast chromosomes that allows the destabilization and selectable loss of that chromosome. After mating a library gene deletion haploid to such a conditional centromere strain, which corresponds to the chromosome carrying the gene deletion, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the gene deletion locus can be generated in these otherwise hybrid diploids. The use of hybrid diploid strains permits complementation of any spurious recessive mutations in the library strain, facilitating attribution of the observed phenotype to the documented gene deletion and dramatically reducing false positive results commonly obtained in library screens. The systematic hybrid LOH method can be applied to virtually any screen utilizing the yeast non-essential gene deletion library and is particularly useful for screens requiring the introduction of a genetic assay into the library strains.",

        "Abstract": "Homologous recombination is an important pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rad52 is a central recombination protein, whereas its paralogue, Rad59, plays a more subtle role in homologous recombination. Both proteins can mediate annealing of complementary single-stranded DNA in vitro, but only Rad52 interacts with replication protein A and the Rad51 recombinase. We have studied the functional overlap between Rad52 and Rad59 in living cells using chimeras of the two proteins and site-directed mutagenesis. We find that Rad52 and Rad59 have both overlapping as well as separate functions in DSB repair. Importantly, the N-terminus of Rad52 possesses functions not supplied by Rad59, which may account for its central role in homologous recombination.",

        "Abstract": "RecQ DNA helicases and Topo III topoisomerases have conserved genetic, physical, and functional interactions that are consistent with a model in which RecQ creates a recombination-dependent substrate that is resolved by Topo III. The phenotype associated with Topo III loss suggests that accumulation of a RecQ-created substrate is detrimental. In yeast, mutation of the TOP3 gene encoding Topo III causes pleiotropic defects that are suppressed by deletion of the RecQ homolog Sgs1. We searched for gene dosage suppressors of top3 and identified Pif1, a DNA helicase that acts with polarity opposite to that of Sgs1. Pif1 overexpression suppresses multiple top3 defects, but exacerbates sgs1 and sgs1 top3 defects. Furthermore, Pif1 helicase activity is essential in the absence of Top3 in an Sgs1-dependent manner. These data clearly demonstrate that Pif1 helicase activity is required to counteract Sgs1 helicase activity that has become uncoupled from Top3. Pif1 genetic interactions with the Sgs1-Top3 pathway are dependent upon homologous recombination. We also find that Pif1 is recruited to DNA repair foci and that the frequency of these foci is significantly increased in top3 mutants. Our results support a model in which Pif1 has a direct role in the prevention or repair of Sgs1-induced DNA damage that accumulates in top3 mutants.",

        "Abstract": "The sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD52 gene contains five potential translation start sites and protein-blot analysis typically detects multiple Rad52 species with different electrophoretic mobilities. Here we define the gene products encoded by RAD52. We show that the multiple Rad52 protein species are due to promiscuous choice of start codons as well as post-translational modification. Specifically, Rad52 is phosphorylated both in a cell cycle-independent and in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Furthermore, phosphorylation is dependent on the presence of the Rad52 C terminus, but not dependent on its interaction with Rad51. We also show that the Rad52 protein can be translated from the last three start sites and expression from any one of them is sufficient for spontaneous recombination and the repair of gamma-ray-induced double-strand breaks.",

        "Abstract": "The RAD52 gene is essential for homologous recombination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. RAD52 is the archetype in an epistasis group of genes essential for DNA damage repair. By catalyzing the replacement of replication protein A with Rad51 on single-stranded DNA, Rad52 likely promotes strand invasion of a double-stranded DNA molecule by single-stranded DNA. Although the sequence and in vitro functions of mammalian RAD52 are conserved with those of yeast, one difference is the presence of introns and consequent splicing of the mammalian RAD52 pre-mRNA. We identified two novel splice variants from the RAD52 gene that are expressed in adult mouse tissues. Expression of these splice variants in tissue culture cells elevates the frequency of recombination that uses a sister chromatid template. To characterize this dominant phenotype further, the RAD52 gene from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was truncated to model the mammalian splice variants. The same dominant sister chromatid recombination phenotype seen in mammalian cells was also observed in yeast. Furthermore, repair from a homologous chromatid is reduced in yeast, implying that the choice of alternative repair pathways may be controlled by these variants. In addition, a dominant DNA repair defect induced by one of the variants in yeast is suppressed by overexpression of RAD51, suggesting that the Rad51-Rad52 interaction is impaired.",

        "Abstract": "In eukaryotes, the cellular response to DNA damage depends on the type of DNA structure being recognized by the checkpoint and repair machinery. DNA ends and single-stranded DNA are hallmarks of double-strand breaks and replication stress. These two structures are recognized by distinct sets of proteins, which are reorganized into a focal assembly at the lesion. Moreover, the composition of these foci is coordinated with cell cycle progression, reflecting the favoring of end-joining in the G1 phase and homologous recombination in S and G2. The assembly of proteins at sites of DNA damage is largely controlled by a network of protein-protein interactions, with the Mre11 complex initiating assembly at DNA ends and replication protein A directing recruitment to single-stranded DNA. This review summarizes current knowledge on the cellular organization of DSB repair and checkpoint proteins focusing on budding yeast and mammalian cells.",

        "Abstract": "SGS1 encodes a DNA helicase whose homologues in human cells include the BLM, WRN, and RECQ4 genes, mutations in which lead to cancer-predisposition syndromes. Clustering of synthetic genetic interactions identified by large-scale genetic network analysis revealed that the genetic interaction profile of the gene RMI1 (RecQ-mediated genome instability, also known as NCE4 and YPL024W) was highly similar to that of SGS1 and TOP3, suggesting a functional relationship between Rmi1 and the Sgs1/Top3 complex. We show that Rmi1 physically interacts with Sgs1 and Top3 and is a third member of this complex. Cells lacking RMI1 activate the Rad53 checkpoint kinase, undergo a mitotic delay, and display increased relocalization of the recombination repair protein Rad52, indicating the presence of spontaneous DNA damage. Consistent with a role for RMI1 in maintaining genome integrity, rmi1Delta cells exhibit increased recombination frequency and increased frequency of gross chromosomal rearrangements. In addition, rmi1Delta strains fail to fully activate Rad53 upon exposure to DNA-damaging agents, suggesting that Rmi1 is also an important part of the Rad53-dependent DNA damage response.",

        "Abstract": "Helicases of the RecQ family and topoisomerase III are evolutionarily conserved proteins important for maintenance of genome stability. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, loss of the TOP3 gene, encoding topoisomerase III, results in a phenotype of slow growth, DNA damage sensitivity, meiotic defects, and hyperrecombination. The sole RecQ helicase in budding yeast, Sgs1, interacts with Top3 both physically and genetically, and the two proteins are thought to act in concert in vivo. Much recent genetic and biochemical evidence points to the role of RecQ helicases and topoisomerase III in regulating homologous recombination (HR) during DNA replication. Previously, we found that mutations in HR genes partially suppress top3 slow growth. Here, we describe the analysis of four additional mutational suppressors of top3 defects: shu1, shu2, psy3, and csm2. These genes belong to one epistasis group and their protein products interact with each other, strongly suggesting that they function as a complex in vivo. Their mutant phenotype indicates that they are important for error-free repair of spontaneous and induced DNA lesions, protecting the genome from mutation. These mutants exhibit an epistatic relationship with rad52 and show altered dynamics of Rad52-YFP foci, suggesting a role for these proteins in recombinational repair.",

        "Abstract": "DNA repair is an essential process for preserving genome integrity in all organisms. In eukaryotes, recombinational repair is choreographed by multiprotein complexes that are organized into centers (foci). Here, we analyze the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and replication stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Mre11 nuclease and the ATM-related Tel1 kinase are the first proteins detected at DSBs. Next, the Rfa1 single-strand DNA binding protein relocalizes to the break and recruits other key checkpoint proteins. Later and only in S and G2 phase, the homologous recombination machinery assembles at the site. Unlike the response to DSBs, Mre11 and recombination proteins are not recruited to hydroxyurea-stalled replication forks unless the forks collapse. The cellular response to DSBs and DNA replication stress is likely directed by the Mre11 complex detecting and processing DNA ends in conjunction with Sae2 and by RP-A recognizing single-stranded DNA and recruiting additional checkpoint and repair proteins.",

        "Title": "Sml1p is a dimer in solution: characterization of denaturation and renaturation of recombinant Sml1p.",
        "Abstract": "Sml1p is a small 104-amino acid protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that binds to the large subunit (Rnr1p) of the ribonucleotide reductase complex (RNR) and inhibits its activity. During DNA damage, S phase, or both, RNR activity must be tightly regulated, since failure to control the cellular level of dNTP pools may lead to genetic abnormalities, such as genome rearrangements, or even cell death. Structural characterization of Sml1p is an important step in understanding the regulation of RNR. Until now the oligomeric state of Sml1p was unknown. Mass spectrometric analysis of wild-type Sml1p revealed an intermolecular disulfide bond involving the cysteine residue at position 14 of the primary sequence. To determine whether disulfide bonding is essential for Sml1p oligomerization, we mutated the Cys14 to serine. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements in the analytical ultracentrifuge show that both wild-type and C14S Sml1p exist as dimers in solution, indicating that the dimerization is not a result of a disulfide bond. Further studies of several truncated Sml1p mutants revealed that the N-terminal 8-20 residues are responsible for dimerization. Unfolding/refolding studies of wild-type and C14S Sml1p reveal that both proteins refold reversibly and have almost identical unfolding/refolding profiles. It appears that Sml1p is a two-domain protein where the N-terminus is responsible for dimerization and the C-terminus for binding and inhibiting Rnr1p activity.",

Components of DNA repair centers are regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation. Repair foci progress through four distinct stages: first, DNA damage recognition and binding of DNA ends by the Mre11 complex and Ku70/80; second, end-processing and binding of single-stranded DNA by replication protein A, which recruits checkpoint proteins; third, recombinational repair during S and G(2) phase; and fourth, disassembly of foci and resumption of the cell cycle.",

We have studied this process in living cells in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using Rad52 as a cell biological marker. In response to DNA damage, Rad52 redistributes itself and forms foci specifically during S phase. We have shown previously that Rad52 foci are centers of DNA repair where multiple DNA double-strand breaks colocalize. Here we report a correlation between the timing of Rad52 focus formation and modification of the Rad52 protein. In addition, we show that the two ends of a double-strand break are held tightly together in the majority of cells. Interestingly, in a small but significant fraction of the S phase cells, the two ends of a break separate suggesting that mechanisms exist to reassociate and align these ends for proper DNA repair.",

        "Abstract": "DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) is an essential process for preserving genomic integrity in all organisms. To investigate this process at the cellular level, we engineered a system of fluorescently marked DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to visualize in vivo DSBR in single cells. Using this system, we demonstrate for the first time that Rad52 DNA repair foci and DSBs colocalize. Time-lapse microscopy reveals that the relocalization of Rad52 protein into a focal assembly is a rapid and reversible process. In addition, analysis of DNA damage checkpoint-deficient cells provides direct evidence for coordination between DNA repair and subsequent release from checkpoint arrest. Finally, analyses of cells experiencing multiple DSBs demonstrate that Rad52 foci are centres of DNA repair capable of simultaneously recruiting more than one DSB.",

        "Abstract": "In eukaryotes, DNA damage elicits a multifaceted response that includes cell cycle arrest, transcriptional activation of DNA repair genes, and, in multicellular organisms, apoptosis. We demonstrate that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DNA damage leads to a 6- to 8-fold increase in dNTP levels. This increase is conferred by an unusual, relaxed dATP feedback inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). Complete elimination of dATP feedback inhibition by mutation of the allosteric activity site in RNR results in 1.6-2 times higher dNTP pools under normal growth conditions, and the pools increase an additional 11- to 17-fold during DNA damage. The increase in dNTP pools dramatically improves survival following DNA damage, but at the same time leads to higher mutation rates. We propose that increased survival and mutation rates result from more efficient translesion DNA synthesis at elevated dNTP concentrations.",

        "Title": "Mutations in homologous recombination genes rescue top3 slow growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",
        "Abstract": "In budding yeast, loss of topoisomerase III, encoded by the TOP3 gene, leads to a genomic instability phenotype that includes slow growth, hyper-sensitivity to genotoxic agents, mitotic hyper-recombination, increased chromosome missegregation, and meiotic failure. Slow growth and other defects of top3 mutants are suppressed by mutation of SGS1, which encodes the only RecQ helicase in S. cerevisiae. sgs1 is epistatic to top3, suggesting that the two proteins act in the same pathway. To identify other factors that function in the Sgs1-Top3 pathway, we undertook a genetic screen for non-sgs1 suppressors of top3 defects. We found that slow growth and DNA damage sensitivity of top3 mutants are suppressed by mutations in RAD51, RAD54, RAD55, and RAD57. In contrast, top3 mutants show extreme synergistic growth defects with mutations in RAD50, MRE11, XRS2, RDH54, and RAD1. We also analyzed recombination at the SUP4-o region, showing that in a rad51, rad54, rad55, or rad57 background top3Delta does not increase recombination to the same degree as in a wild-type strain. These results suggest that the presence of the Rad51 homologous recombination complex in a top3 background facilitates creation of detrimental intermediates by Sgs1. We present a model wherein Rad51 helps recruit Sgs1-Top3 to sites of replicative damage.",

        "Title": "Interaction with Rad51 is indispensable for recombination mediator function of Rad52.",
        "Abstract": "In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the RAD52 gene is indispensable for homologous recombination and DNA repair. Rad52 protein binds DNA, anneals complementary ssDNA strands, and self-associates to form multimeric complexes. Moreover, Rad52 physically interacts with the Rad51 recombinase and serves as a mediator in the Rad51-catalyzed DNA strand exchange reaction. Here, we examine the functional significance of the Rad51/Rad52 interaction. Through a series of deletions, we have identified residues 409-420 of Rad52 as being indispensable and likely sufficient for its interaction with Rad51. We have constructed a four-amino acid deletion mutation within this region of Rad52 to ablate its interaction with Rad51. We show that the rad52delta409-412 mutant protein is defective in the mediator function in vitro even though none of the other Rad52 activities, namely, DNA binding, ssDNA annealing, and protein oligomerization, are affected. We also show that the sensitivity of the rad52delta409-412 mutant to ionizing radiation can be complemented by overexpression of Rad51. These results thus demonstrate the significance of the Rad51-Rad52 interaction in homologous recombination.",

        "Abstract": "Each of the adaptamer-directed genome manipulation methods is predicated on the fact that recombination between two DNAs is enhanced by increasing the length of homology. Many of the current PCR-based genome manipulation techniques rely on very short homologies to promote recombination. In these cases homology length is dictated by the technical limits of oligonucleotide synthesis. Adaptamers circumvent this problem since long homology regions are produced in a first round of PCR, and then fused to the selectable marker in a second round of PCR via complementary sequence tags on the adaptamers. Furthermore, many of the techniques described here rely on preexisting and commercially available adaptamer sets that can be obtained inexpensively rather than designing new primers for every experiment. Although a cost is incurred when performing multiple PCR amplifications, the increase in recombination efficiency is dramatic. Finally, the adaptamer-mediated PCR fusion methodology is versatile and can be applied to varied genome manipulations.",

        "Abstract": "Rad52 is a DNA-binding protein that stimulates the annealing of complementary single-stranded DNA. Only the N terminus of Rad52 is evolutionarily conserved; it contains the core activity of the protein, including its DNA-binding activity. To identify amino acid residues that are important for Rad52 function(s), we systematically replaced 76 of 165 amino acid residues in the N terminus with alanine. These substitutions were examined for their effects on the repair of gamma-ray-induced DNA damage and on both interchromosomal and direct repeat heteroallelic recombination. This analysis identified five regions that are required for efficient gamma-ray damage repair or mitotic recombination. Two regions, I and II, also contain the classic mutations, rad52-2 and rad52-1, respectively. Interestingly, four of the five regions contain mutations that impair the ability to repair gamma-ray-induced DNA damage yet still allow mitotic recombinants to be produced at rates that are similar to or higher than those obtained with wild-type strains. In addition, a new class of separation-of-function mutation that is only partially deficient in the repair of gamma-ray damage, but exhibits decreased mitotic recombination similar to rad52 null strains, was identified. These results suggest that Rad52 protein acts differently on lesions that occur spontaneously during the cell cycle than on those induced by gamma-irradiation.",

        "Abstract": "Cell cycle checkpoints are evolutionarily conserved surveillance systems that protect genomic stability and prevent oncogenesis in mammals. One important target of checkpoint control is ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in dNTP and DNA synthesis. In both yeast and humans, RNR is transcriptionally induced after DNA damage via Mec1/Rad53 (yeast) and ATM/CHK2 (human) checkpoint pathways. In addition, yeast checkpoint proteins Mec1 and Rad53 also regulate the RNR inhibitor Sml1. After DNA damage or at S phase, Mec1 and Rad53 control the phosphorylation and concomitant degradation of Sml1 protein. This new layer of control contributes to the increased dNTP production likely necessary for DNA repair and replication; however, the molecular mechanism is unclear. Here we show that Dun1, a downstream kinase of Mec1/Rad53, genetically and physically interacts with Sml1 in vivo. The absence of Dun1 activity leads to the accumulation of Sml1 protein at S phase and after DNA damage. As a result, dun1Delta strains need more time to finish DNA replication, are defective in mitochondrial DNA propagation, and are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents. Moreover, phospho-Sml1 is absent or dramatically reduced in dun1Delta cells. Finally, Dun1 can phosphorylate Sml1 in vitro. These results suggest that Dun1 kinase function is the last step required in the Mec1/Rad53 cascade to remove Sml1 during S phase and after DNA damage.",

        "Abstract": "Gene disruptions are a vital tool for understanding Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene function. An arrayed library of gene disruption strains has been produced by a consortium of yeast laboratories; however their use is limited to a single genetic background. Since the yeast research community works with several different strain backgrounds, disruption libraries in other common laboratory strains are desirable. We have developed simple PCR-based methods that allow transfer of gene disruptions from the S288C-derived strain library into any Saccharomyces strain. One method transfers the unique sequence tags that flank each of the disrupted genes and replaces the kanamycin resistance marker with a recyclable URA3 gene from Kluyveromyces lactis. All gene-specific PCR amplifications for this method are performed using a pre-existing set of primers that are commercially available. We have also extended this PCR technique to develop a second general gene disruption method suitable for any transformable strain of Saccharomyces.",
