        "Abstract": "For many decades, the management of cancer has utilized radiation therapy, which continues to evolve with technology to improve patient outcomes. However, despite the standardization of treatment plans and the establishment of best clinical practices based on prospective, randomized trials and adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, the outcomes from radiation therapy are highly variable and dependent on a number of factors, including patient demographics, tumor characteristics/histology, and treatment parameters. In this study, we attempt to use available patient data and treatment parameters at the time of radiation therapy to predict future outcomes using artificial intelligence (AI).",

        "Abstract": "In addition to replicative histones, eukaryotic genomes encode a repertoire of non-replicative variant histones, providing additional layers of structural and epigenetic regulation. Here, we systematically replace individual replicative human histones with non-replicative human variant histones using a histone replacement system in yeast. We show that variants H2A.J, TsH2B, and H3.5 complement their respective replicative counterparts. However, macroH2A1 fails to complement, and its overexpression is toxic in yeast, negatively interacting with yeast's native histones and kinetochore genes. To isolate yeast with macroH2A1 chromatin, we uncouple the effects of its macro and histone fold domains, revealing that both domains suffice to override native nucleosome positioning. Furthermore, both uncoupled constructs of macroH2A1 exhibit lower nucleosome occupancy, decreased short-range chromatin interactions (<20 kb), disrupted centromeric clustering, and increased chromosome instability. Our observations demonstrate that lack of a canonical histone H2A dramatically alters chromatin organization in yeast, leading to genome instability and substantial fitness defects.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding prostate response to castration and androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) is critical to improving long-term prostate cancer (PCa) patient survival. Here, we use a multi-omics approach on 229,794 single cells to create a mouse single-cell reference atlas for interpreting mouse prostate biology and castration response. Our reference atlas refines single-cell annotations and provides a chromatin context, which, when coupled with mouse lineage tracing, demonstrates that castration-resistant luminal cells are distinct from the pre-existent urethra-proximal stem/progenitor cells. Molecular pathway analysis and therapeutic studies further implicate AP1 (JUN/FOS), WNT/\u03b2-catenin, FOXQ1, NF-\u03baB, and JAK/STAT pathways as major drivers of castration-resistant luminal populations with relevance to human PCa. Our datasets, which can be explored through an interactive portal (https://visportal.roswellpark.org/data/tang/), can aid in developing combination treatments with ARSI for advanced PCa patients.",

        "Abstract": "Embryo size, specification, and homeostasis are regulated by a complex gene regulatory and signaling network. Here we used gene expression signatures of Wnt-activated mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) clones to reverse engineer an mESC regulatory network. We identify NKX1-2 as a novel master regulator of preimplantation embryo development. We find that Nkx1-2 inhibition reduces nascent RNA synthesis, downregulates genes controlling ribosome biogenesis, RNA translation, and transport, and induces severe alteration of nucleolus structure, resulting in the exclusion of RNA polymerase I from nucleoli. In turn, NKX1-2 loss of function leads to chromosome missegregation in the 2- to 4-cell embryo stages, severe decrease in blastomere numbers, alterations of tight junctions (TJs), and impairment of microlumen coarsening. Overall, these changes impair the blastocoel expansion-collapse cycle and embryo cavitation, leading to altered lineage specification and developmental arrest.",

        "Abstract": "There is a strong need to develop an insulin delivery system suitable for oral administration and preserving natural (\u03b1-helix) insulin conformation. In this work, we fabricated alginate-gelatin hydrogel beads for insulin encapsulation. Altering matrix composition and crosslinking agents has resulted in various surface morphologies and internal spatial organization. The structures of the insulin-loaded matrices were studied using optical and field emission electronic microscopy. We use FTIR spectroscopy to identify insulin conformation changes as affected by the hydrogel matrices. It was found that blended alginate-gelatin matrices demonstrate better encapsulation efficiency and stronger swelling resistance to a simulated gastric environment than sodium alginate beads crosslinked with the CaCl",

        "Abstract": "Retinoic acid (RA) signaling is a master regulator of vertebrate development with crucial roles in directing body axis orientation and tissue differentiation, including in the reproductive system. However, a mechanistic understanding of how RA signaling promotes cell lineage identity in different tissues is often missing. Here, leveraging prostate organoid technology, we demonstrated that RA signaling orchestrates the commitment of adult mouse prostate progenitors to glandular identity, epithelial barrier integrity, and ultimately, proper specification of the prostatic lumen. Mechanistically, RA-dependent RAR\u03b3 activation promotes the expression of the pioneer factor Foxa1, which synergizes with the androgen pathway for proper luminal expansion, cytoarchitecture and function.

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have facilitated studies of cell states and plasticity in tissue maintenance and cancer, including in the prostate. Here we present meta-analyses of multiple new and published scRNA-seq datasets to establish reference cell type classifications for the normal mouse and human prostate. Our analyses demonstrate transcriptomic similarities between epithelial cell states in the normal prostate, in the regressed prostate after androgen-deprivation, and in primary prostate tumors. During regression in the mouse prostate, all epithelial cells shift their expression profiles towards a proximal periurethral (PrU) state, demonstrating an androgen-dependent plasticity that is restored to normal during androgen restoration and regeneration. In the human prostate, we find progressive rewiring of transcriptional programs across epithelial cell types in benign prostate hyperplasia and treatment-na\u00efve prostate cancer. Notably, we detect copy number variants predominantly within Luminal Acinar cells in prostate tumors, suggesting a bias in their cell type of origin, as well as a larger field of transcriptomic alterations in non-tumor cells. Finally, we observe that Luminal Acinar tumor cells in treatment-na\u00efve prostate cancer display heterogeneous androgen receptor (AR) signaling activity, including a split between high-AR and low-AR profiles with similarity to PrU-like states. Taken together, our analyses of cellular heterogeneity and plasticity provide important translational insights into the origin and treatment response of prostate cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Whether synthetic genomes can power life has attracted broad interest in the synthetic biology field. Here, we report de novo synthesis of the largest eukaryotic chromosome thus far, synIV, a 1,454,621-bp yeast chromosome resulting from extensive genome streamlining and modification. We developed megachunk assembly combined with a hierarchical integration strategy, which significantly increased the accuracy and flexibility of synthetic chromosome construction. Besides the drastic sequence changes, we further manipulated the 3D structure of synIV to explore spatial gene regulation. Surprisingly, we found few gene expression changes, suggesting that positioning inside the yeast nucleoplasm plays a minor role in gene regulation. Lastly, we tethered synIV to the inner nuclear membrane via its hundreds of loxPsym sites and observed transcriptional repression of the entire chromosome, demonstrating chromosome-wide transcription manipulation without changing the DNA sequences. Our manipulation of the spatial structure of synIV sheds light on higher-order architectural design of the synthetic genomes.",

        "Abstract": "In addition to replicative histones, eukaryotic genomes encode a repertoire of non-replicative variant histones providing additional layers of structural and epigenetic regulation. Here, we systematically replaced individual replicative human histones with non-replicative human variant histones using a histone replacement system in yeast. Variants H2A.J, TsH2B, and H3.5 complemented for their respective replicative counterparts. However, macroH2A1 failed to complement and its expression was toxic in yeast, negatively interacting with native yeast histones and kinetochore genes. To isolate yeast with \"macroH2A1 chromatin\" we decoupled the effects of its macro and histone fold domains, which revealed that both domains sufficed to override native yeast nucleosome positioning. Furthermore, both modified constructs of macroH2A1 exhibited lower nucleosome occupancy that correlated with decreased short-range chromatin interactions (<20 Kb), disrupted centromeric clustering, and increased chromosome instability. While supporting viability, macroH2A1 dramatically alters chromatin organization in yeast, leading to genome instability and massive fitness defects.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the role of the immune microenvironment in modulating intratumor heterogeneity is essential for effective cancer therapies. Using multicolor lineage tracing in genetically engineered mouse models and single-cell transcriptomics, we show that slowly progressing tumors contain a multiclonal landscape of relatively homogeneous subpopulations within a well-organized tumor microenvironment. In more advanced and aggressive tumors, however, the multiclonal landscape develops into competing dominant and minor clones accompanied by a disordered microenvironment. We demonstrate that this dominant/minor landscape is associated with differential immunoediting, in which minor clones are marked by an increased expression of IFN\u03b3-response genes and the T\u00a0cell-activating chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl11. Furthermore, immunomodulation of the IFN\u03b3 pathway can rescue minor clones from elimination. Notably, the immune-specific gene signature of minor clones exhibits a prognostic value for biochemical recurrence-free survival in human prostate cancer. These findings suggest new immunotherapy approaches for modulating clonal fitness and tumor progression in prostate cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding prostate response to castration and androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) is critical to improving long-term prostate cancer (PCa) patient survival. Here we use a multi-omics approach on 229,794 single cells to create a mouse single-cell reference atlas better suited to interpreting mouse prostate biology and castration response. Our reference atlas refines single-cell annotations and provides chromatin context, which, when coupled with mouse lineage tracing demonstrates that the castration-resistant luminal cells are distinct from the pre-existent urethra-proximal stem/progenitor cells. Molecular pathway analysis and therapeutic studies further implicate JUN/FOS, WNT/B-Catenin, FOXQ1, NFkB, and JAK/STAT pathways as the major drivers of castration-resistant luminal populations with high relevance to human PCa. Importantly, we demonstrate the utility of our datasets, which can be explored through an interactive portal (https://visportal.roswellpark.org/data/tang/), to aid in developing novel combination treatments with ARSI for advanced PCa patients.",

        "Abstract": "Prioritizing treatments for individual patients with cancer remains challenging, and performing coclinical studies using patient-derived models in real time is often unfeasible. To circumvent these challenges, we introduce OncoLoop, a precision medicine framework that predicts drug sensitivity in human tumors and their preexisting high-fidelity (cognate) model(s) by leveraging drug perturbation profiles. As a proof of concept, we applied OncoLoop to prostate cancer using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) that recapitulate a broad spectrum of disease states, including castration-resistant, metastatic, and neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Interrogation of human prostate cancer cohorts by Master Regulator (MR) conservation analysis revealed that most patients with advanced prostate cancer were represented by at least one cognate GEMM-derived tumor (GEMM-DT). Drugs predicted to invert MR activity in patients and their cognate GEMM-DTs were successfully validated in allograft, syngeneic, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of tumors and metastasis. Furthermore, OncoLoop-predicted drugs enhanced the efficacy of clinically relevant drugs, namely, the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab and the AR inhibitor enzalutamide.",

        "Abstract": "The mammalian genome encodes thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), many of which are developmentally regulated and differentially expressed across tissues, suggesting their potential roles in cellular differentiation. Despite this expression pattern, little is known about how lncRNAs influence lineage commitment at the molecular level. Here, we demonstrate that perturbation of an embryonic stem cell/early embryonic lncRNA, pluripotency-associated transcript 4 (Platr4), directly influences the specification of cardiac-mesoderm-lineage differentiation. We show that Platr4 acts as a molecular scaffold or chaperone interacting with the Hippo-signaling pathway molecules Yap and Tead4 to regulate the expression of a downstream target gene, Ctgf, which is crucial to the cardiac-lineage program. Importantly, Platr4 knockout mice exhibit myocardial atrophy and valve mucinous degeneration, which are both associated with reduced cardiac output and sudden heart failure. Together, our findings provide evidence that Platr4 is required in cardiac-lineage specification and adult heart function in mice.",

        "Abstract": "Major genomic deletions in independent eukaryotic lineages have led to repeated ancestral loss of biosynthesis pathways for nine of the twenty canonical amino acids. While the evolutionary forces driving these polyphyletic deletion events are not well understood, the consequence is that extant metazoans are unable to produce nine essential amino acids (EAAs). Previous studies have highlighted that EAA biosynthesis tends to be more energetically costly, raising the possibility that these pathways were lost from organisms with access to abundant EAAs. It is unclear whether present-day metazoans can reaccept these pathways to resurrect biosynthetic capabilities that were lost long ago or whether evolution has rendered EAA pathways incompatible with metazoan metabolism. Here, we report progress on a large-scale synthetic genomics effort to reestablish EAA biosynthetic functionality in mammalian cells. We designed codon-optimized biosynthesis pathways based on genes mined from ",

        "Abstract": "The healthy prostate is a relatively quiescent tissue. Yet, prostate epithelium overgrowth is a common condition during aging, associated with urinary dysfunction and tumorigenesis. For over thirty years, TGF-\u03b2 ligands have been known to induce cytostasis in a variety of epithelia, but the intracellular pathway mediating this signal in the prostate, and its relevance for quiescence, have remained elusive. Here, using mouse prostate organoids to model epithelial progenitors, we find that intra-epithelial non-canonical Activin A signaling inhibits cell proliferation in a Smad-independent manner. Mechanistically, Activin A triggers Tak1 and p38 \u039cAPK activity, leading to p16 and p21 nuclear import. Spontaneous evasion from this quiescent state occurs upon prolonged culture, due to reduced Activin A secretion, a condition associated with DNA replication stress and aneuploidy. Organoids capable to escape quiescence in vitro are also able to implant with increased frequency into immunocompetent mice. This study demonstrates that non-canonical Activin A signaling safeguards epithelial quiescence in the healthy prostate, with potential implications for the understanding of cancer initiation, and the development of therapies targeting quiescent tumor progenitors.",

        "Abstract": "The test for the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis is to find a target expressed on all, and only CSCs in a patient tumor, then eliminate all cells with that target that eliminates the cancer. That test has not yet been achieved, but CSC diagnostics and targets found on CSCs and some other cells have resulted in a few clinically relevant therapies. However, it has become apparent that eliminating the subset of tumor cells characterized by self-renewal properties is essential for long-term tumor control. CSCs are able to regenerate and initiate tumor growth, recapitulating the heterogeneity present in the tumor before treatment. As great progress has been made in identifying and elucidating the biology of CSCs as well as their interactions with the tumor microenvironment, the time seems ripe for novel therapeutic strategies that target CSCs to find clinical applicability.\u00a0On May 19-21, 2021, researchers in cancer stem cells met virtually for the Keystone eSymposium \"Cancer Stem Cells: Advances in Biology and Clinical Translation\" to discuss recent advances in the understanding of CSCs as well as clinical efforts to target these populations.",

        "Abstract": "It has been recognized for decades that ERBB signaling is important in prostate cancer, but targeting ERBB receptors as a therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer has been ineffective clinically. However, we show here that membranous HER3 protein is commonly highly expressed in lethal prostate cancer, associating with reduced time to castration resistance (CR) and survival. Multiplex immunofluorescence indicated that the HER3 ligand NRG1 is detectable primarily in tumor-infiltrating myelomonocytic cells in human prostate cancer; this observation was confirmed using single-cell RNA sequencing of human prostate cancer biopsies and murine transgenic prostate cancer models. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patient-derived xenograft organoids with high HER3 expression as well as mouse prostate cancer organoids, recombinant NRG1 enhanced proliferation and survival. Supernatant from murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells promoted murine prostate cancer organoid growth ",

        "Abstract": "The recent advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing technology has provided new fundamental insights into the heterogeneity of the prostate epithelium. Several independent studies have described extensive heterogeneity of the luminal epithelial compartment, including a major division between a novel population of luminal cells located in the proximal region of the prostate ducts versus luminal cells located more distally. Proximal luminal cells as well as novel periurethral cells display increased progenitor potential in organoid culture and tissue reconstitution assays, but not in lineage-tracing analyses during prostate homeostasis, suggesting context-dependent plasticity of these populations. Here we describe and synthesize recent findings regarding the epithelial cell populations in the mouse prostate, draw comparisons to the human prostate, and address the relevance of these findings to prostate diseases and cancer.",

In principle, understanding the basis for prostate cancer heterogeneity can help distinguish aggressive from indolent disease, and help overcome castration-resistance in advanced prostate cancer. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in understanding the cell types of origin, putative cancer stem cells, and tumor plasticity in prostate cancer, focusing on insights from studies of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). We will also outline future directions for investigating tumor heterogeneity using mouse models of prostate cancer.",

Here we show that the prostate-specific homeoprotein NKX3.1 suppresses prostate cancer initiation by protecting mitochondria from oxidative stress. Integrating analyses of genetically engineered mouse models, human prostate cancer cells, and human prostate cancer organotypic cultures, we find that, in response to oxidative stress, NKX3.1 is imported to mitochondria via the chaperone protein HSPA9, where it regulates transcription of mitochondrial-encoded electron transport chain (ETC) genes, thereby restoring oxidative phosphorylation and preventing cancer initiation.

        "Abstract": "Telomere length control is critical for cellular lifespan and tumor suppression. Telomerase is transiently activated in the inner cell mass of the developing blastocyst to reset telomere reserves. Its silencing upon differentiation leads to gradual telomere shortening in somatic cells. Here, we report that transcriptional regulation through cis-regulatory elements only partially accounts for telomerase activation in pluripotent cells. Instead, developmental control of telomerase is primarily driven by an alternative splicing event, centered around hTERT exon 2. Skipping of exon 2 triggers hTERT mRNA decay in differentiated cells, and conversely, its retention promotes telomerase accumulation in pluripotent cells. We identify SON as a regulator of exon 2 alternative splicing and report a patient carrying a SON mutation and suffering from insufficient telomerase and short telomeres. In summary, our study highlights a critical role for hTERT alternative splicing in the developmental regulation of telomerase and implicates defective splicing in telomere biology disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Myostatin (MSTN) is a transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) family member that normally acts to limit muscle growth. The function of MSTN is partially redundant with that of another TGF-\u03b2 family member, activin A. MSTN and activin A are capable of signaling through a complex of type II and type I receptors. Here, we investigated the roles of two type II receptors (ACVR2 and ACVR2B) and two type I receptors (ALK4 and ALK5) in the regulation of muscle mass by these ligands by genetically targeting these receptors either alone or in combination specifically in myofibers in mice. We show that targeting signaling in myofibers is sufficient to cause significant increases in muscle mass, showing that myofibers are the direct target for signaling by these ligands in the regulation of muscle growth. Moreover, we show that there is functional redundancy between the two type II receptors as well as between the two type I receptors and that all four type II/type I receptor combinations are utilized in vivo. Targeting signaling specifically in myofibers also led to reductions in overall body fat content and improved glucose metabolism in mice fed either regular chow or a high-fat diet, demonstrating that these metabolic effects are the result of enhanced muscling. We observed no effect, however, on either bone density or muscle regeneration in mice in which signaling was targeted in myofibers. The latter finding implies that MSTN likely signals to other cells, such as satellite cells, in addition to myofibers to regulate muscle homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Androgen receptor (AR) plays a fundamental role in most aspects of adult prostate homeostasis, and anti-androgen therapy represents the cornerstone of prostate cancer treatment. However, early prostate organogenesis takes place during pre-pubertal stages when androgen levels are low, raising the possibility that AR function is more limited during prostate development. Here, we use inducible AR deletion and lineage tracing in genetically engineered mice to show that basal and luminal epithelial progenitors do not require cell-autonomous AR activity during prostate development. We also demonstrate the existence of a transient bipotent luminal progenitor that can generate luminal and basal progeny, yet is also independent of AR function. Furthermore, molecular analyses of AR-deleted luminal cells isolated from developing prostates indicate their similarity to wild-type cells. Our findings suggest that low androgen levels correlate with luminal plasticity in prostate development and may have implications for understanding how AR inhibition promotes lineage plasticity in prostate cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the cellular constituents of the prostate is essential for identifying the cell of origin for prostate adenocarcinoma. Here, we describe a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the adult mouse prostate epithelium, which displays extensive heterogeneity. We observe distal lobe-specific luminal epithelial populations (LumA, LumD, LumL, and LumV), a proximally enriched luminal population (LumP) that is not lobe-specific, and a periurethral population (PrU) that shares both basal and luminal features. Functional analyses suggest that LumP and PrU cells have multipotent progenitor activity in organoid formation and tissue reconstitution assays. Furthermore, we show that mouse distal and proximal luminal cells are most similar to human acinar and ductal populations, that a PrU-like population is conserved between species, and that the mouse lateral prostate is most similar to the human peripheral zone. Our findings elucidate new prostate epithelial progenitors, and help resolve long-standing questions about anatomical relationships between the mouse and human prostate.",

        "Title": "The Role of Lineage Plasticity in Prostate Cancer Therapy Resistance.",
        "Abstract": "Lineage plasticity has emerged as an important mechanism of treatment resistance in prostate cancer. Treatment-refractory prostate cancers are increasingly associated with loss of luminal prostate markers, and in many cases induction of developmental programs, stem cell-like phenotypes, and neuroendocrine/neuronal features. Clinically, lineage plasticity may manifest as low PSA progression, resistance to androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors, and sometimes small cell/neuroendocrine pathologic features observed on metastatic biopsy. This mechanism is not restricted to prostate cancer as other malignancies also demonstrate lineage plasticity during resistance to targeted therapies. At present, there is no established therapeutic approach for patients with advanced prostate cancer developing lineage plasticity or small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) due to knowledge gaps in the underlying biology. Few clinical trials address questions in this space, and the outlook for patients remains poor. To move forward, urgently needed are: (i) a fundamental understanding of how lineage plasticity occurs and how it can best be defined; (ii) the temporal contribution and cooperation of emerging drivers; (iii) preclinical models that recapitulate biology of the disease and the recognized phenotypes; (iv) identification of therapeutic targets; and (v) novel trial designs dedicated to the entity as it is defined. This Perspective represents a consensus arising from the NCI Workshop on Lineage Plasticity and Androgen Receptor-Independent Prostate Cancer. We focus on the critical questions underlying lineage plasticity and AR-independent prostate cancer, outline knowledge and resource gaps, and identify strategies to facilitate future collaborative clinical translational and basic studies in this space.",

        "Abstract": "Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a non-coding mutation in the first intron of the frataxin (FXN) gene that suppresses its expression. Compensatory hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and conduction system abnormalities in FRDA\u00a0lead to cardiomyocyte (CM) death and fibrosis, consequently resulting in heart failure and arrhythmias. Murine models have been developed to study disease pathology in the past two decades; however, differences between human and mouse physiology and metabolism have limited the relevance of animal studies in cardiac disease conditions. To bridge this gap, we aimed to generate species-specific, functional in vitro experimental models of FRDA using 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) engineered cardiac tissues from FXN-deficient human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes (hPSC-hvCMs) and to compare their contractile and electrophysiological properties with healthy tissue constructs.",

        "Abstract": "In the prostate, stem and progenitor cell regenerative capacities have been ascribed to both basal and luminal epithelial cells. Here, we show that a rare subset of mesenchymal cells in the prostate are epithelial-primed Nestin-expressing cells (EPNECs) that can generate self-renewing prostate organoids with bipotential capacity. Upon transplantation, these EPNECs can form prostate gland tissue grafts at the clonal level. Lineage-tracing analyses show that cells marked by Nestin or NG2 transgenic mice contribute to prostate epithelium during organogenesis. In the adult, modest contributions in repeated rounds of regression and regeneration are observed, whereas prostate epithelial cells derived from Nestin/NG2-marked cells are dramatically increased after severe irradiation-induced organ damage. These results indicate that Nestin/NG2 expression marks a novel radioresistant prostate stem cell that is active during development and displays reserve stem cell activity for tissue maintenance.",

        "Abstract": "The accurate determination of protein-protein interactions has been an important focus of molecular biology toward which much progress has been made due to the continuous development of existing and new technologies. However, current methods\u00a0can have limitations, including scale and restriction to high affinity interactions, limiting our understanding of a large subset of these interactions. Here, we describe a modified bacterial-hybrid assay that employs combined selectable and scalable reporters that enable the sensitive screening of large peptide libraries followed by the sorting of positive interactions by the level of reporter output. We have applied this tool to characterize a set of human and E.\u00a0coli PDZ domains. Our results are consistent with prior characterization of these proteins, and the improved sensitivity increases our ability to predict known and novel in vivo binding partners. This approach allows for the recovery of a wide range of affinities with a high throughput method that does not sacrifice the scale of the screen.",

        "Abstract": "Deciphering cell-intrinsic mechanisms of metastasis progression in vivo is essential to identify novel therapeutic approaches. Here we elucidate cell-intrinsic drivers of metastatic prostate cancer progression through analyses of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) and correlative studies of human prostate cancer. Expression profiling of lineage-marked cells from mouse primary tumors and metastases defines a signature of de novo metastatic progression. Cross-species master regulator analyses comparing this mouse signature with a comparable human signature identifies conserved drivers of metastatic progression with demonstrable clinical and functional relevance. In particular, nuclear receptor binding SET Domain Protein 2 (NSD2) is robustly expressed in lethal prostate cancer in humans, while its silencing inhibits metastasis of mouse allografts in vivo. We propose that cross-species analysis can elucidate mechanisms of metastasis progression, thus providing potential additional therapeutic opportunities for treatment of lethal prostate cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Engineering multicellularity is one of the next breakthroughs for Synthetic Biology. A key bottleneck to building multicellular systems is the lack of a scalable signaling language with a large number of interfaces that can be used simultaneously. Here, we present a modular, scalable, intercellular signaling language in yeast based on fungal mating peptide/G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) pairs harnessed from nature. First, through genome-mining, we assemble 32 functional peptide-GPCR signaling interfaces with a range of dose-response characteristics. Next, we demonstrate that these interfaces can be combined into two-cell communication links, which serve as assembly units for higher-order communication topologies. Finally, we show 56 functional, two-cell links, which we use to assemble three- to six-member communication topologies and a three-member interdependent community. Importantly, our peptide-GPCR language is scalable and tunable by genetic encoding, requires minimal component engineering, and should be massively scalable by further application of our genome mining pipeline or directed evolution.",

        "Abstract": "SCRaMbLE (Synthetic Chromosome Rearrangement and Modification by LoxP-mediated Evolution) is a genome restructuring technique that can be used in synthetic genomes such as that of Sc2.0, the synthetic yeast genome, which contains hundreds to thousands of strategically positioned loxPsym sites. SCRaMbLE has been used to induce rearrangements in yeast strains harboring one or more synthetic chromosomes, as well as plasmid DNA in vitro and in vivo. Here we describe a collection of heterozygous diploid strains produced by mating haploid semisynthetic Sc2.0 strains to haploid native parental strains. We subsequently demonstrate that such heterozygous diploid strains are more robust to the effects of SCRaMbLE than haploid semisynthetic strains, rapidly improve rationally selected phenotypes in SCRaMbLEd heterozygous diploids, and establish that multiple sets of independent genomic rearrangements are able to lead to similar phenotype enhancements. Finally, we show that heterozygous diploid SCRaMbLE can also be carried out in interspecies hybrid strains.",

        "Abstract": "Compatibility between host cells and heterologous pathways is a challenge for constructing organisms with high productivity or gain of function. Designer yeast cells incorporating the Synthetic Chromosome Rearrangement and Modification by LoxP-mediated Evolution (SCRaMbLE) system provide a platform for generating genotype diversity. Here we construct a genetic AND gate to enable precise control of the SCRaMbLE method to generate synthetic haploid and diploid yeast with desired phenotypes. The yield of carotenoids is increased to 1.5-fold by SCRaMbLEing haploid strains and we determine that the deletion of YEL013W is responsible for the increase. Based on the SCRaMbLEing in diploid strains, we develop a strategy called Multiplex SCRaMbLE Iterative Cycling (MuSIC) to increase the production of carotenoids up to 38.8-fold through 5 iterative cycles of SCRaMbLE. This strategy is potentially a powerful tool for increasing the production of bio-based chemicals and for mining deep knowledge.",

        "Abstract": "Historically, it has been widely presumed that differentiated cells are determined during development and become irreversibly committed to their designated fates. In certain circumstances, however, differentiated cells can display plasticity by changing their identity, either by dedifferentiation to a progenitor-like state or by transdifferentiation to an alternative differentiated cell type. Such cellular plasticity can be triggered by physiological or oncogenic stress, or it can be experimentally induced through cellular reprogramming. Notably, physiological stresses that promote plasticity, such as severe tissue damage, inflammation, or senescence, also represent hallmarks of cancer. Furthermore, key drivers of cellular plasticity include major oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways and can be exacerbated by drug treatment. Thus, plasticity may help cancer cells evade detection and treatment. We propose that cancer can be considered as a disease of excess plasticity, a notion that has important implications for intervention and treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Bladder cancer is the fifth most prevalent cancer in the U.S., yet is understudied, and few laboratory models exist that reflect the biology of the human disease. Here, we describe a biobank of patient-derived organoid lines that recapitulates the histopathological and molecular diversity of human bladder cancer. Organoid lines can be established efficiently from patient biopsies acquired before and after disease recurrence and are interconvertible with orthotopic xenografts. Notably, organoid lines often retain parental tumor heterogeneity and exhibit a spectrum of genomic changes that are consistent with tumor evolution in culture. Analyses of drug response using bladder tumor organoids show partial correlations with mutational profiles, as well as changes associated with treatment resistance, and specific responses can be validated using xenografts in\u00a0vivo. Our studies indicate that patient-derived bladder tumor organoids represent a faithful model system for studying tumor evolution and treatment response in the context of precision cancer medicine.",

        "Abstract": "Master regulatory genes of tissue specification play key roles in stem/progenitor cells and are often important in cancer. In the prostate, androgen receptor (AR) is a master regulator essential for development and tumorigenesis, but its specific functions in prostate stem/progenitor cells have not been elucidated. We have investigated AR function in CARNs (CAstration-Resistant Nkx3.1-expressing cells), a luminal stem/progenitor cell that functions in prostate regeneration. Using genetically--engineered mouse models and novel prostate epithelial cell lines, we find that progenitor properties of CARNs are largely unaffected by AR deletion, apart from decreased proliferation ",

        "Abstract": "To date, reprogramming strategies for generating cell types of interest have been facilitated by detailed understanding of relevant developmental regulatory factors. However, identification of such regulatory drivers often represents a major challenge, as specific gene combinations may be required for reprogramming. Here we show that a computational systems approach can identify cell type specification genes (master regulators) that act synergistically, and demonstrate its application for reprogramming of fibroblasts to prostate tissue. We use three such master regulators (FOXA1, NKX3.1 and androgen receptor, AR) in a primed conversion strategy starting from mouse fibroblasts, resulting in prostate tissue grafts with appropriate histological and molecular properties that respond to androgen-deprivation. Moreover, generation of reprogrammed prostate does not require traversal of a pluripotent state. Thus, we describe a general strategy by which cell types and tissues can be generated even with limited knowledge of the developmental pathways required for their specification in vivo.",

        "Title": "Low birth weight is associated with impaired murine kidney development and function.",
        "Abstract": "BackgroundLow birth weight (LBW) neonates have impaired kidney development that leaves them susceptible to kidney disease and hypertension during adulthood. The study here identifies events that blunt nephrogenesis and kidney development in the murine LBW neonate.MethodsWe examined survival, kidney development, GFR, gene expression, and cyto-/chemokines in the LBW offspring of malnourished (caloric and protein-restricted) pregnant mice.ResultsMalnourished pregnant mothers gave birth to LBW neonates that had 40% reduced body weight and 54% decreased survival. Renal blood perfusion was reduced by 37%, whereas kidney volume and GFR were diminished in the LBW neonate. During gestation, the LBW neonatal kidney had 2.2-fold increased apoptosis, 76% decreased SIX2+ progenitor cells, downregulation of mesenchymal-to-epithelial signaling factors Wnt9b and Fgf8, 64% less renal vesicle formation, and 32% fewer nephrons than controls. At birth, increased plasma levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12(p70), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the LBW neonate reduced SIX2+ progenitor cells.ConclusionIncreased pro-inflammatory cytokines in the LBW neonate decrease SIX2+ stem cells in the developing kidney. Reduced renal stem cells (along with the decreased mesenchymal-to-epithelial signaling) blunt renal vesicle generation, nephron formation, and kidney development. Subsequently, the mouse LBW neonate has reduced glomeruli volume, renal perfusion, and GFR.",

The investigation of prostate development is partly driven by its potential relevance to prostate cancer, in particular the apparent re-awakening of key developmental programs that occur during tumorigenesis. However, our current knowledge of the mechanisms that drive prostate organogenesis is far from complete.

        "Abstract": "Although the design of the synthetic yeast genome Sc2.0 is highly conservative with respect to gene content, the deletion of several classes of repeated sequences and the introduction of thousands of designer changes may affect genome organization and potentially alter cellular functions. We report here the Hi-C-determined three-dimensional (3D) conformations of Sc2.0 chromosomes. The absence of repeats leads to a smoother contact pattern and more precisely tractable chromosome conformations, and the large-scale genomic organization is globally unaffected by the presence of synthetic chromosome(s). Two exceptions are synIII, which lacks the silent mating-type cassettes, and synXII, specifically when the ribosomal DNA is moved to another chromosome. We also exploit the contact maps to detect rearrangements induced in SCRaMbLE (synthetic chromosome rearrangement and modification by ",

        "Abstract": "Microglia are resident inflammatory cells of the CNS and have important roles in development, homeostasis and a variety of neurologic and psychiatric diseases. Difficulties in procuring human microglia have limited their study and hampered the clinical translation of microglia-based treatments shown to be effective in animal disease models. Here we report the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) into microglia-like cells by exposure to defined factors and co-culture with astrocytes. These iPSC-derived microglia have the phenotype, gene expression profile and functional properties of brain-isolated microglia. Murine iPSC-derived microglia generated using a similar protocol have equivalent efficacy to primary brain-isolated microglia in treatment of murine syngeneic intracranial malignant gliomas. The ability to generate human microglia facilitates the further study of this important CNS cell type and raises the possibility of their use in personalized medicine applications.",

        "Abstract": "Nonshivering thermogenesis is the process of biological heat production in mammals and is primarily mediated by brown adipose tissue (BAT). Through ubiquitous expression of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) on the mitochondrial inner membrane, BAT displays uncoupling of fuel combustion and ATP production in order to dissipate energy as heat. Because of its crucial role in regulating energy homeostasis, ongoing exploration of BAT has emphasized its therapeutic potential in addressing the global epidemics of obesity and diabetes. The recent appreciation that adult humans possess functional BAT strengthens this prospect. Furthermore, it has been identified that there are both classical brown adipocytes residing in dedicated BAT depots and \"beige\" adipocytes residing in white adipose tissue depots that can acquire BAT-like characteristics in response to environmental cues. This review aims to provide a brief overview of BAT research and summarize recent findings concerning the physiological, cellular, and developmental characteristics of brown adipocytes. In addition, some key genetic, molecular, and pharmacologic targets of BAT/Beige cells that have been reported to have therapeutic potential to combat obesity will be discussed.",

This protocol describes a nondestructive live-cell FRET assay for robust quantification of relative binding affinities for protein-protein interactions. Unlike other approaches, our method correlates the measured FRET efficiencies to relative concentration of interacting proteins to determine binding isotherms while including collisional FRET corrections. We detail how to assemble and calibrate the equipment using experimental and theoretical procedures. A step-by-step protocol is given for sample preparation, data acquisition and analysis. The method uses relatively inexpensive and widely available equipment and can be performed with minimal training. Implementation of the imaging setup requires up to 1 week, and sample preparation takes \u223c1-3 d. An individual FRET experiment, including control measurements, can be completed within 4-6 h, with data analysis requiring an additional 1-3 h.",

The prevalence and geographic distribution of PAH vary depending on the type and etiology of the disease. Despite enormous efforts in the research and development of therapeutic agents in the last twenty years, the disease remains relatively incurable and the overall prognosis remains guarded. Median survival for an untreated patient is 2.8 years. In the last three decades, there have been dramatic advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in the disease, resulting in emerging new treatment strategies. In the following pages, we will review currently approved treatments for PAH, as well as a new generation of investigational drugs.",

        "Abstract": "Contact with the extracellular matrix is essential for maintenance of epithelial cells in many tissues, while in its absence epithelial cells can detach and undergo anoikis. Here, we show that anoikis of luminal cells in the prostate epithelium is followed by a program of tissue repair that is mediated in part by differentiation of basal epithelial cells to luminal cells. We describe a mouse model in which inducible deletion of E-cadherin in prostate luminal cells results in their apoptotic cell death by anoikis, in the absence of phenotypic effects in the surrounding stroma. Quantitative assessments of proliferation and cell death in the luminal and basal compartments indicate that basal cells can rapidly generate luminal cells. Thus, our findings identify a role for basal-to-luminal differentiation in prostate epithelial repair, and provide a normal context to analogous processes that may occur during prostate cancer initiation.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity is a complex, multifactorial disease that has been extensively researched in recent times. Obesity is characterized by excess deposition of adipose tissue in response to surplus energy. Despite the negative connotations of adipose tissue (AT), it serves as a critical endocrine organ. Adipose tissue is a source of several adipokines and cytokines which have been deemed important for both normal metabolic function and disease formation. The discoveries of metabolically active brown AT in adult humans and adipose tissue derived stem cells (ADSC) have been key findings in the past decade with potential therapeutic implications. ADSCs represent an enticing pool of multipotent adult stem cells because of their noncontroversial nature, relative abundance, ease of isolation, and expandability. A decade and a half since the discovery of ADSCs, the scientific community is still working to uncover their therapeutic potential in a wide range of diseases. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent developments in the field of ADSCs and examine their potential use in transplantation and cell-based therapies for the regeneration of diseased organs and systems. We also hope to provide perspective on how to best utilize this readily available, powerful pool of stem cells in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding new therapeutic paradigms for both castrate-sensitive and more aggressive castrate-resistant prostate cancer is essential to improve clinical outcomes. As a critically important cellular process, autophagy promotes stress tolerance by recycling intracellular components to sustain metabolism important for tumor survival. To assess the importance of autophagy in prostate cancer, we generated a new autochthonous genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) with inducible prostate-specific deficiency in the Pten tumor suppressor and autophagy-related-7 (Atg7) genes. Atg7 deficiency produced an autophagy-deficient phenotype and delayed Pten-deficient prostate tumor progression in both castrate-na\u00efve and castrate-resistant cancers. Atg7-deficient tumors display evidence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, suggesting that autophagy may promote prostate tumorigenesis through management of protein homeostasis. Taken together, these data support the importance of autophagy for both castrate-na\u00efve and castrate-resistant growth in a newly developed GEMM, suggesting a new paradigm and model to study approaches to inhibit autophagy in combination with known and new therapies for advanced prostate cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Analyses of cell types of origin for prostate cancer should result in new insights into mechanisms of tumor initiation, and may lead to improved prognosis and selection of appropriate therapies. Here, we review studies using a range of methodologies to investigate the cell of origin for mouse and human prostate cancer. Notably, analyses using tissue recombination assays support basal epithelial cells as a cell of origin, whereas in vivo lineage-tracing studies in genetically-engineered mice implicate luminal cells. We describe how these results can be potentially reconciled by a conceptual distinction between cells of origin and cells of mutation, and outline how new experimental approaches can address the potential relationship between cell types of origin and disease outcome.",

        "Abstract": "Cripto-1, a member of the epidermal growth factor-Cripto-1/FRL-1/Cryptic family, is critical for early embryonic development. Together with its ligand Nodal, Cripto-1 has been found to be associated with the undifferentiated status of mouse and human embryonic stem cells. Several studies have clearly shown that Cripto-1 is involved in regulating branching morphogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of the mammary gland both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo and together with the cofactor GRP78 is critical for the maintenance of mammary stem cells ex\u00a0vivo. Our previous studies showed that mammary-specific overexpression of human Cripto-1 exhibited dramatic morphological alterations in nulliparous mice mammary glands. The present study shows a novel mechanism for Cripto-1 regulation of mammary gland development through direct effects on progesterone receptor expression and pathways regulated by progesterone in the mammary gland. We demonstrate a strict temporal regulation of mouse Cripto-1 (mCripto-1) expression that occurs during mammary gland development and a stage-specific function of mCripto-1 signaling during mammary gland development. Our data suggest that Cripto-1, like the progesterone receptor, is not required for the initial ductal growth but is essential for subsequent side branching and alveologenesis during the initial stages of pregnancy. Dissection of the mechanism by which this occurs indicates that mCripto-1 activates receptor activator NF-\u03baB/receptor activator NF-\u03baB ligand, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways.",

        "Title": "ProNodal acts via FGFR3 to govern duration of Shh expression in the prechordal mesoderm.",
        "Abstract": "The secreted glycoprotein sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed in the prechordal mesoderm, where it plays a crucial role in induction and patterning of the ventral forebrain. Currently little is known about how Shh is regulated in prechordal tissue. Here we show that in the embryonic chick, Shh is expressed transiently in prechordal mesoderm, and is governed by unprocessed Nodal. Exposure of prechordal mesoderm microcultures to Nodal-conditioned medium, the Nodal inhibitor CerS, or to an ALK4/5/7 inhibitor reveals that Nodal is required to maintain both Shh and Gsc expression, but whereas Gsc is largely maintained through canonical signalling, Nodal signals through a non-canonical route to maintain Shh. Further, Shh expression can be maintained by a recombinant Nodal cleavage mutant, proNodal, but not by purified mature Nodal. A number of lines of evidence suggest that proNodal acts via FGFR3. ProNodal and FGFR3 co-immunoprecipitate and proNodal increases FGFR3 tyrosine phosphorylation. In microcultures, soluble FGFR3 abolishes Shh without affecting Gsc expression. Further, prechordal mesoderm cells in which Fgfr3 expression is reduced by Fgfr3 siRNA fail to bind to proNodal. Finally, targeted electroporation of Fgfr3 siRNA to prechordal mesoderm in vivo results in premature Shh downregulation without affecting Gsc. We report an inverse correlation between proNodal-FGFR3 signalling and pSmad1/5/8, and show that proNodal-FGFR3 signalling antagonises BMP-mediated pSmad1/5/8 signalling, which is poised to downregulate Shh. Our studies suggest that proNodal/FGFR3 signalling governs Shh duration by repressing canonical BMP signalling, and that local BMPs rapidly silence Shh once endogenous Nodal-FGFR3 signalling is downregulated.",

Here, we introduce an approach that uses drug perturbation data from GEM models to predict drug efficacy in human cancer. Network-based analysis of expression profiles from in\u00a0vivo treatment of GEM models identified drugs and drug combinations that inhibit the activity of FOXM1 and CENPF, which are master regulators of prostate cancer malignancy. Validation of mouse and human prostate cancer models confirmed the specificity and synergy of a predicted drug combination to abrogate FOXM1/CENPF activity and inhibit tumorigenicity. Network-based analysis of treatment signatures from GEM models identified treatment-responsive genes in human prostate cancer that are potential biomarkers of patient response. More generally, this approach allows systematic identification of drugs that inhibit tumor dependencies, thereby improving the utility of GEM models for prioritizing drugs for clinical evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "The cancer stem cell model proposes that tumors have a hierarchical organization in which tumorigenic cells give rise to non-tumorigenic cells, with only a subset of stem-like cells able to propagate the tumor. In the case of prostate cancer, recent analyses of genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models have provided evidence supporting the existence of cancer stem cells in vivo. These studies suggest that cancer stem cells capable of tumor propagation exist at various stages of tumor progression from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to advanced metastatic and castration-resistant disease. However, studies of stem cells in prostate cancer have been limited by available approaches for evaluating their functional properties in cell culture and transplantation assays. Given the role of the tumor microenvironment and the putative cancer stem cell niche, future studies using GEM models to analyze cancer stem cells in their native tissue microenvironment are likely to be highly informative.",

        "Abstract": "The relationship between chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation is an area of intense investigation. We characterized the spatial relationships between alleles of the Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog genes in single cells during the earliest stages of mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation and during embryonic development. We describe homologous pairing of the Oct4 alleles during ESC differentiation and embryogenesis, and we present evidence that pairing is correlated with the kinetics of ESC differentiation. Importantly, we identify critical DNA elements within the Oct4 promoter/enhancer region that mediate pairing of Oct4 alleles. Finally, we show that mutation of OCT4/SOX2 binding sites within this region abolishes inter-chromosomal interactions and affects accumulation of the repressive\u00a0H3K9me2 modification at the Oct4 enhancer. Our findings demonstrate that chromatin organization and transcriptional programs are intimately connected in ESCs and that the dynamic positioning of the Oct4 alleles is associated with the transition from pluripotency to lineage specification.",

        "Abstract": "To date, many regulatory genes and signalling events coordinating mammalian development from blastocyst to gastrulation stages have been identified by mutational analyses and reverse-genetic approaches, typically on a gene-by-gene basis. More recent studies have applied bioinformatic approaches to generate regulatory network models of gene interactions on a genome-wide scale. Such models have provided insights into the gene networks regulating pluripotency in embryonic and epiblast stem cells, as well as cell-lineage determination in vivo. Here, we review how regulatory networks constructed for different stem cell types relate to corresponding networks in vivo and provide insights into understanding the molecular regulation of the blastocyst-gastrula transition.",

We propose a framework for the systematic discovery of genetic alterations that are causal determinants of disease, by prioritizing genes upstream of functional disease drivers, within regulatory networks inferred de novo from experimental data. We tested this framework by identifying the genetic determinants of the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. Our analysis uncovered KLHL9 deletions as upstream activators of two previously established master regulators of the subtype, C/EBP\u03b2 and C/EBP\u03b4. Rescue of KLHL9 expression induced proteasomal degradation of C/EBP proteins, abrogated the mesenchymal signature, and reduced tumor viability in vitro and in vivo. Deletions of KLHL9 were confirmed in > 50% of mesenchymal cases in an independent cohort, thus representing the most frequent genetic determinant of the subtype. The method generalized to study other human diseases, including breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Abstract": "The intrinsic ability to exhibit self-organizing morphogenetic properties in ex vivo culture may represent a general property of tissue stem cells. Here we show that single luminal stem/progenitor cells can generate prostate organoids in a three-dimensional culture system in the absence of stroma. Organoids generated from CARNs (castration-resistant Nkx3.1-expressing cells) or normal prostate epithelia exhibit tissue architecture containing luminal and basal cells, undergo long-term expansion in culture and exhibit functional androgen receptor signalling. Lineage-tracing demonstrates that luminal cells are favoured for organoid formation and generate basal cells in culture. Furthermore, tumour organoids can initiate from CARNs after oncogenic transformation and from mouse models of prostate cancer, and can facilitate analyses of drug response. Finally, we provide evidence supporting the feasibility of organoid studies of human prostate tissue. Our studies underscore the progenitor properties of luminal cells, and identify in vitro approaches for studying prostate biology.",

        "Abstract": "The identification of cell types of origin for cancer has important implications for tumor stratification and personalized treatment. For prostate cancer, the cell of origin has been intensively studied, but it has remained unclear whether basal or luminal epithelial cells, or both, represent cells of origin under physiological conditions in vivo. Here, we use a novel lineage-tracing strategy to assess the cell of origin in a diverse range of mouse models, including Nkx3.1(+/-); Pten(+/-), Pten(+/-), Hi-Myc, and TRAMP mice, as well as a hormonal carcinogenesis model. Our results show that luminal cells are consistently the observed cell of origin for each model in situ; however, explanted basal cells from these mice can generate tumors in grafts. Consequently, we propose that luminal cells are favored as cells of origin in many contexts, whereas basal cells only give rise to tumors after differentiation into luminal cells.",

        "Abstract": "To identify regulatory drivers of prostate cancer malignancy, we have assembled genome-wide regulatory networks (interactomes) for human and mouse prostate cancer from expression profiles of human tumors and of genetically engineered mouse models, respectively. Cross-species computational analysis of these interactomes has identified FOXM1 and CENPF as synergistic master regulators of prostate cancer malignancy. Experimental validation shows that FOXM1 and CENPF function synergistically to promote tumor growth by coordinated regulation of target gene expression and activation of key signaling pathways associated with prostate cancer malignancy. Furthermore, co-expression of FOXM1 and CENPF is a robust prognostic indicator of poor survival and metastasis. Thus, genome-wide cross-species interrogation of regulatory networks represents a valuable strategy to identify causal mechanisms of human cancer.",

        "Title": "Obesity-associated variants within FTO form long-range functional connections with IRX3.",
        "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reproducibly associated variants within introns of FTO with increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although the molecular mechanisms linking these noncoding variants with obesity are not immediately obvious, subsequent studies in mice demonstrated that FTO expression levels influence body mass and composition phenotypes. However, no direct connection between the obesity-associated variants and FTO expression or function has been made. Here we show that the obesity-associated noncoding sequences within FTO are functionally connected, at megabase distances, with the homeobox gene IRX3. The obesity-associated FTO region directly interacts with the promoters of IRX3 as well as FTO in the human, mouse and zebrafish genomes. Furthermore, long-range enhancers within this region recapitulate aspects of IRX3 expression, suggesting that the obesity-associated interval belongs to the regulatory landscape of IRX3. Consistent with this, obesity-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with expression of IRX3, but not FTO, in human brains. A direct link between IRX3 expression and regulation of body mass and composition is demonstrated by a reduction in body weight of 25 to 30% in Irx3-deficient mice, primarily through the loss of fat mass and increase in basal metabolic rate with browning of white adipose tissue. Finally, hypothalamic expression of a dominant-negative form of Irx3 reproduces the metabolic phenotypes of Irx3-deficient mice. Our data suggest that IRX3 is a functional long-range target of obesity-associated variants within FTO and represents a novel determinant of body mass and composition.",

        "Abstract": "We report the case of a patient with a painful subcutaneous nodule, measuring 13 mm \u00d7 17 mm, at the pretibial graft aperture site, which presented two years after a successful anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with an autologous hamstring graft. A bioabsorbable poly-L-lactide interference screw was used for graft fixation at the tibial aperture. The patient underwent surgical excision of the lesion and curettage at the tunnel aperture. Grossly, extruded fragments of the screw and a thick pseudocapsule of surrounding tissue were excised. There was no communication between the tunnel aperture and the knee joint. The graft was also intact. Histological analysis revealed fragments of the bioabsorbable material in association with fibrous and granulomatous chronic inflammatory cells. This was consistent with a foreign body reaction. The patient subsequently recovered and resumed preinjury level of activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing a nodular granulomatous type reaction to foreign bioabsorbable poly-L-lactide screw material subsequent to an anterior cruciate reconstruction surgery.",

        "Abstract": "Many newly diagnosed prostate cancers present as low Gleason score tumors that require no treatment intervention. Distinguishing the many indolent tumors from the minority of lethal ones remains a major clinical challenge. We now show that low Gleason score prostate tumors can be distinguished as indolent and aggressive subgroups on the basis of their expression of genes associated with aging and senescence. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we identified a 19-gene signature enriched in indolent prostate tumors. We then further classified this signature with a decision tree learning model to identify three genes--FGFR1, PMP22, and CDKN1A--that together accurately predicted outcome of low Gleason score tumors. Validation of this three-gene panel on independent cohorts confirmed its independent prognostic value as well as its ability to improve prognosis with currently used clinical nomograms. Furthermore, protein expression of this three-gene panel in biopsy samples distinguished Gleason 6 patients who failed surveillance over a 10-year period. We propose that this signature may be incorporated into prognostic assays for monitoring patients on active surveillance to facilitate appropriate courses of treatment.",

        "Title": "Rhabdomyolysis.",
        "Abstract": "Rhabdomyolysis is a well-known clinical syndrome of muscle injury associated with myoglobinuria, electrolyte abnormalities, and often acute kidney injury (AKI). The pathophysiology involves injury to the myocyte membrane and/or altered energy production that results in increased intracellular calcium concentrations and initiation of destructive processes. Myoglobin has been identified as the primary muscle constituent contributing to renal damage in rhabdomyolysis. Although rhabdomyolysis was first described with crush injuries and trauma, more common causes in hospitalized patients at present include prescription and over-the-counter medications, alcohol, and illicit drugs. The diagnosis is confirmed by elevated creatine kinase levels, but additional testing is needed to evaluate for potential causes, electrolyte abnormalities, and AKI. Treatment is aimed at discontinuation of further skeletal muscle damage, prevention of acute renal failure, and rapid identification of potentially life-threatening complications. Review of existing published data reveals a lack of high-quality evidence to support many interventions that are often recommended for treating rhabdomyolysis. Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation to restore renal perfusion and increase urine flow is agreed on as the main intervention for preventing and treating AKI. There is little evidence other than from animal studies, retrospective observational studies, and case series to support the routine use of bicarbonate-containing fluids, mannitol, and loop diuretics. Hyperkalemia and compartment syndrome are additional complications of rhabdomyolysis that must be treated effectively. A definite need exists for well-designed prospective studies to determine the optimal management of rhabdomyolysis.",

        "Abstract": "Combinatorial activation of PI3-kinase and RAS signaling occurs frequently in advanced prostate cancer and is associated with adverse patient outcome. We now report that the oncogenic Ets variant 4 (Etv4) promotes prostate cancer metastasis in response to coactivation of PI3-kinase and Ras signaling pathways in a genetically engineered mouse model of highly penetrant, metastatic prostate cancer. Using an inducible Cre driver to simultaneously inactivate Pten while activating oncogenic Kras and a fluorescent reporter allele in the prostate epithelium, we performed lineage tracing in vivo to define the temporal and spatial occurrence of prostate tumors, disseminated tumor cells, and metastases. These analyses revealed that though disseminated tumors cells arise early following the initial occurrence of prostate tumors, there is a significant temporal lag in metastasis, which is temporally coincident with the up-regulation of Etv4 expression in primary tumors. Functional studies showed that knockdown of Etv4 in a metastatic cell line derived from the mouse model abrogates the metastatic phenotype but does not affect tumor growth. Notably, expression and activation of ETV4, but not other oncogenic ETS genes, is correlated with activation of both PI3-kinase and Ras signaling in human prostate tumors and metastases. Our findings indicate that ETV4 promotes metastasis in prostate tumors that have activation of PI3-kinase and Ras signaling, and therefore, ETV4 represents a potential target of therapeutic intervention for metastatic prostate cancer.",

We now show that initiation of prostate tumours in basal or luminal epithelial cells in mouse models results in tumours with distinct molecular signatures that are predictive of human patient outcomes. Furthermore, our analysis of untransformed basal cells reveals an unexpected assay dependence of their stem cell properties in sphere formation and transplantation assays versus genetic lineage tracing during prostate regeneration and adult tissue homeostasis. Although oncogenic transformation of basal cells gives rise to tumours with luminal phenotypes, cross-species bioinformatic analyses indicate that tumours of luminal origin are more aggressive than tumours of basal origin, and identify a molecular signature associated with patient outcome. Our results reveal the inherent plasticity of basal cells, and support a model in which different cells of origin generate distinct molecular subtypes of prostate cancer.",

        "Abstract": "A set of vectors was constructed that enable combined and systematic testing of metabolic pathway genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The vectors are available as CEN/ARS and 2\u2009\u00b5-based plasmids with a choice of three inducible promoters, P(GAL1) , P(CUP1) and P(ADH2) . These features offer control over the initiation and level of gene expression. In addition, the vectors can be used as templates to generate PCR fragments for targeted chromosomal integration of gene expression cassettes. Selection markers are flanked by loxP elements to allow efficient CreA-mediated marker removal and recycling after genomic integration. For each promoter, expression of a bacterial lacZ reporter gene was characterized from plasmid-based and integrated chromosomal cassettes, and compared to that of the glycolytic P(PGK1) promoter. Plasmid stabilities were also determined. The promoters showed distinct activity profiles useful for modulating expression of metabolic pathway genes. This series of plasmids with inducible promoters extends our previous vector set carrying the constitutive promoters P(PGK1) , P(TEF1) and P(HXT7-391) .",

        "Abstract": "Skeletal muscle regeneration mainly depends on satellite cells, a population of resident muscle stem cells. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying satellite cell activation is still largely undefined. Here, we show that Cripto, a regulator of early embryogenesis, is a novel regulator of muscle regeneration and satellite cell progression toward the myogenic lineage. Conditional inactivation of cripto in adult satellite cells compromises skeletal muscle regeneration, whereas gain of function of Cripto accelerates regeneration, leading to muscle hypertrophy. Moreover, we provide evidence that Cripto modulates myogenic cell determination and promotes proliferation by antagonizing the TGF-\u03b2 ligand myostatin. Our data provide unique insights into the molecular and cellular basis of Cripto activity in skeletal muscle regeneration and raise previously undescribed implications for stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.",

        "Abstract": "Neuroendocrine (NE) prostate tumors and neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in prostatic adenocarcinomas have been associated with poor prognosis. In this study, we used the TRAMP mouse model that develops NE prostate tumors to identify key factors that can lead to NED. We have previously reported that NE tumors express the forkhead transcription factor, Foxa2, Mash1 (mouse achaete scute homolog-1), as well as Synaptophysin. In TRAMP, the prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) first expresses Foxa2 and Synaptophysin, which then progresses to NE cancer. In order to determine if Foxa2 is dispensable for development or maintenance of NE cancer, a conditional knock-out of Foxa2 in TRAMP mice was generated by breeding mice with two floxed alleles of Foxa2 and one copy of Nkx3.1-Cre. Nkx3.1-Cre/Foxa2(loxP/loxP) mice showed loss of Foxa2 expression in embryonic prostatic buds. No expression of Foxa2 was seen in the adult prostate in either conditional null or control mice. Foxa2 is universally expressed in all wild type TRAMP NE tumors, but Mash1 expression is seen only in a few samples in a few cells. With the loss of Foxa2 in the NE tumors of the TRAMP/Nkx3.1-Cre/Foxa2(loxP/loxP) mice, the expression of the pro-neuronal gene Mash1 is upregulated. NE tumors from both the TRAMP control and Foxa2-deficient TRAMP prostate express Synaptophysin and SV40 Large T-antigen, and both show a loss of androgen receptor expression in NE cells. These studies suggest that the TRAMP NE tumors can form in the absence of Foxa2 by an up regulation of Mash1.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies of prostate cancer and other tumor types have revealed significant support, as well as unexpected complexities, for the application of concepts from normal stem cell biology to cancer. In particular, the cell of origin and cancer stem cell models have been proposed to explain the heterogeneity of tumors during the initiation, propagation, and evolution of cancer. Thus, a basis of intertumor heterogeneity has emerged from studies investigating whether stem cells and/or non-stem cells can serve as cells of origin for cancer and give rise to tumor subtypes that vary in disease outcome. Furthermore, analyses of putative cancer stem cells have revealed the genetically diverse nature of cancers and expanded our understanding of intratumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution. Overall, the principles that have emerged from these stem cell studies highlight the challenges to be surmounted to develop effective treatment strategies for cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Both the PI3K \u2192 Akt \u2192 mTOR and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways are often deregulated in prostate tumors with poor prognosis. Here we describe a new genetically engineered mouse model of prostate cancer in which PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling is activated by inducible disruption of PTEN, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) MAPK signaling is activated by inducible expression of a BRAF(V600E) oncogene. These tissue-specific compound mutant mice develop lethal prostate tumors that are inherently resistant to castration. These tumors bypass cellular senescence and disseminate to lymph nodes, bone marrow, and lungs where they form overt metastases in approximately 30% of the cases. Activation of PI3K \u2192 Akt \u2192 mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways in these prostate tumors cooperate to upregulate c-Myc. Accordingly, therapeutic treatments with rapamycin and PD0325901 to target these pathways, respectively, attenuate c-Myc levels and reduce tumor and metastatic burden. Together, our findings suggest a generalized therapeutic approach to target c-Myc activation in prostate cancer by combinatorial targeting of the PI3K \u2192 Akt \u2192 mTOR and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathways.",

        "Title": "Dual targeting of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer in a genetically engineered mouse model.",
        "Abstract": "Although the prognosis for clinically localized prostate cancer is now favorable, there are still no curative treatments for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and, therefore, it remains fatal. In this study, we investigate a new therapeutic approach for treatment of CRPC, which involves dual targeting of a major signaling pathway that is frequently deregulated in the disease. We found that dual targeting of the Akt and mTOR signaling pathways with their respective inhibitors, MK-2206 and ridaforolimus (MK-8669), is highly effective for inhibiting CRPC in preclinical studies in vivo using a refined genetically engineered mouse model of the disease. The efficacy of the combination treatment contrasts with their limited efficacy as single agents, since delivery of MK-2206 or MK-8669 individually had a modest impact in vivo on the overall tumor phenotype. In human prostate cancer cell lines, although not in the mouse model, the synergistic actions of MK-2206 and ridaforolimus (MK-8669) are due in part to limiting the mTORC2 feedback activation of Akt. Moreover, the effects of these drugs are mediated by inhibition of cellular proliferation via the retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway. Our findings suggest that dual targeting of the Akt and mTOR signaling pathways using MK-2206 and ridaforolimus (MK-8669) may be effective for treatment of CRPC, particularly for patients with deregulated Rb pathway activity.",

        "Title": "Enhanced arsenate uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae overexpressing the Pho84 phosphate transporter.",
        "Abstract": "Arsenate is a major toxic constituent in arsenic-contaminated water supplies. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered as a potential biosorbent for enhanced arsenate accumulation. The phosphate transporter, Pho84p, known to import arsenate, was overexpressed using a 2\u03bc-based vector carrying PHO84 under the control of the late-phase ADH2 promoter. Arsenate uptake was then evaluated using a resting cell system. In buffer solutions containing high arsenate concentrations (12,000 and 30,000 ppb), the engineered strains internalized up to 750 \u03bcg of arsenate per gram of cells, a 50% improvement over control strains. Increasing the cell mass 2.5-fold yielded a proportional increase in the volumetric arsenate uptake, while maintaining the same level of specific uptake. At high levels of arsenate, loss from the intact cells to the medium was observed with time; knockouts of two known arsenic extrusion genes, ACR3 and FPS1, did not prevent this loss. At trace level concentrations (120 ppb), rapid and total arsenate removal was observed. The presence of 50 \u03bcM phosphate reduced uptake by approximately 15% in buffer containing 80 \u03bcM (6,000 ppb) arsenate. At trace levels of arsenate (70 ppb), the phosphate reduced the initial rate of uptake, but not the total amount removed. PHO84 mRNA levels were nearly 30 times higher in the engineered strains relative to the control strains. Uptake may no longer be a limiting factor in the engineered system and further increases should be possible by upregulating the downstream reduction and sequestration pathways.",

        "Title": "Initiation of prostate cancer in mice by Tp53R270H: evidence for an alternative molecular progression.",
        "Abstract": "Tp53 mutations are common in human prostate cancer (CaP), occurring with a frequency of \u223c30% and \u223c70% in localized and metastatic disease, respectively. In vitro studies have determined several common mutations of Tp53 that have specific gain-of-function properties in addition to loss of function, including the ability to promote castration-resistant (CR) growth of CaP cells in some contexts. To date, a lack of suitable mouse models has prohibited investigation of the role played by Tp53 mutations in mediating CaP progression in vivo. Here, we describe the effects of conditional expression of a mutant Tp53 (Tp53(R270H); equivalent to the human hotspot mutant R273H) in the prostate epithelium of mice. Heterozygous \"Tp53(LSL-R270H/+)\" [129S4(Trp53(tm3Tyj))] and \"Nkx3.1-Cre\" [129S(Nkx3-1(tm3(cre)Mms))] mice with prostate-specific expression of the Tp53(R270H) mutation (p53(R270H/+) Nkx3.1-Cre mice) were bred onto an FVB/N background via speed congenesis to produce strain FVB.129S4(Trp53(tm3Tyj/wt)); FVB.129S(Nkx3-1(tm3(cre)Mms/wt)) and littermate genotype negative control mice. These mutant mice had significantly increased incidences of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions, and these appeared earlier, compared with the Nkx3.1 haploinsufficient (Nkx3.1-Cre het) littermate mice, which did not express the Tp53 mutation. PIN lesions in these mice showed consistent progression and some developed into invasive adenocarcinoma with a high grade, sarcomatoid or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. PIN lesions were similar to those seen in PTEN conditional knockout mice, with evidence of AKT activation concomitant with neoplastic proliferation. However, the invasive tumor phenotype is rarely seen in previously described mouse models of prostatic neoplasia. These data indicate that the Tp53(R270H) mutation plays a role in CaP initiation. This finding has not previously been reported. Further characterization of this model, particularly in a setting of androgen deprivation, should allow further insight into the mechanisms by which the Tp53(R270H) mutation mediates CaP progression.",

        "Abstract": "Little is known about the dynamics of early ecological succession during experimental conventionalization of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; thus, we measured changes in bacterial communities over time, at two different mucosal sites (cecum and jejunum), with germfree C57BL/6 mice as the recipients of cecal contents (input community) from a C57BL/6 donor mouse. Bacterial communities were monitored using pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries from the cecum and jejunum and analyzed by a variety of ecological metrics. Bacterial communities, at day 1 postconventionalization, in the cecum and jejunum had lower diversity and were distinct from the input community (dominated by either Escherichia or Bacteroides). However, by days 7 and 21, the recipient communities had become significantly diverse and the cecal communities resembled those of the donor and donor littermates, confirming that transfer of cecal contents results in reassembly of the community in the cecum 7 to 21 days later. However, bacterial communities in the recipient jejunum displayed significant structural heterogeneity compared to each other or the donor inoculum or the donor littermates, suggesting that the bacterial community of the jejunum is more dynamic during the first 21 days of conventionalization. This report demonstrates that (i) mature input communities do not simply reassemble at mucosal sites during conventionalization (they first transform into a \"pioneering\" community and over time take on the appearance, in membership and structure, of the original input community) and (ii) the specific mucosal environment plays a role in shaping the community.",

        "Abstract": "The signaling pathway for Nodal, a ligand of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily, plays a central role in regulating the differentiation and/or maintenance of stem cell types that can be derived from the peri-implantation mouse embryo. Extra-embryonic endoderm stem (XEN) cells resemble the primitive endoderm of the blastocyst, which normally gives rise to the parietal and the visceral endoderm in vivo, but XEN cells do not contribute efficiently to the visceral endoderm in chimeric embryos. We have found that XEN cells treated with Nodal or Cripto (Tdgf1), an EGF-CFC co-receptor for Nodal, display upregulation of markers for visceral endoderm as well as anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), and can contribute to visceral endoderm and AVE in chimeric embryos. In culture, XEN cells do not express Cripto, but do express the related EGF-CFC co-receptor Cryptic (Cfc1), and require Cryptic for Nodal signaling. Notably, the response to Nodal is inhibited by the Alk4/Alk5/Alk7 inhibitor SB431542, but the response to Cripto is unaffected, suggesting that the activity of Cripto is at least partially independent of type I receptor kinase activity. Gene set enrichment analysis of genome-wide expression signatures generated from XEN cells under these treatment conditions confirmed the differing responses of Nodal- and Cripto-treated XEN cells to SB431542. Our findings define distinct pathways for Nodal and Cripto in the differentiation of visceral endoderm and AVE from XEN cells and provide new insights into the specification of these cell types in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Cancers frequently arise as a result of an acquired genomic instability and the subsequent clonal evolution of neoplastic cells with variable patterns of genetic aberrations. Thus, the presence and behaviors of distinct clonal populations in each patient's tumor may underlie multiple clinical phenotypes in cancers. We applied DNA content-based flow sorting to identify and isolate the nuclei of clonal populations from tumor biopsies, which was coupled with array CGH and targeted resequencing. The results produced high-definition genomic profiles of clonal populations from 40 pancreatic adenocarcinomas and a set of prostate adenocarcinomas, including serial biopsies from a patient who progressed to androgen-independent metastatic disease. The genomes of clonal populations were found to have patient-specific aberrations of clinical relevance. Furthermore, we identified genomic aberrations specific to therapeutically responsive and resistant clones arising during the evolution of androgen-independent metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma. We also distinguished divergent clonal populations within single biopsies and mapped aberrations in multiple aneuploid populations arising in primary and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We propose that our high-definition analyses of the genomes of distinct clonal populations of cancer cells in patients in vivo can help guide diagnoses and tailor approaches to personalized treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Malignant gliomas are highly lethal because of their resistance to conventional treatments. Recent evidence suggests that a minor subpopulation of cells with stem cell properties reside within these tumors. These tumor stem cells are more resistant to radiation and chemotherapies than their counterpart differentiated tumor cells and may underlie the persistence and recurrence of tumors following treatment. The various mechanisms by which tumor stem cells avoid or repair the damaging effects of cancer therapies are discussed.",

        "Title": "A vector set for systematic metabolic engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",
        "Abstract": "A set of shuttle vectors was constructed to facilitate expression of genes for metabolic engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Selectable markers include the URA3, TRP1, MET15, LEU2-d8, HIS3 and CAN1 genes. Differential expression of genes can be achieved as each marker is available on both CEN/ARS- and 2 \u00b5-containing plasmids. Unique restriction sites downstream of TEF1, PGK1 or HXT7-391 promoters and upstream of the CYC1 terminator allow insertion of open-reading frame cassettes for expression. Furthermore, a fragment appropriate for integration into the genome via homologous recombination can be readily generated in a polymerase chain reaction. Vector marker genes are flanked by loxP recognition sites for the CreA recombinase to allow efficient site-specific marker deletion and recycling. Expression and copy number were characterized for representative high- and low-copy vectors carrying the different marker and promoter sequences. Metabolic engineering typically requires the stable introduction of multiple genes and genomic integration is often preferred. This requires an expanded number of stable expression sites relative to standard gene expression studies. This study demonstrated the practicality of polymerase chain reaction amplification of an expression cassette and genetic marker, and subsequent replacement of endogenous retrotransposons by homologous recombination with flanking sequences. Such reporters were expressed comparably to those inserted at standard integration loci. This expands the number of available characterized integration sites and demonstrates that such sites provide a virtually inexhaustible pool of integration targets for stable expression of multiple genes. Together these vectors and expression loci will facilitate combinatorial gene expression for metabolic engineering.",

        "Abstract": "Despite much recent progress, prostate cancer continues to represent a major cause of cancer-related mortality and morbidity in men. Since early studies on the role of the androgen receptor that led to the advent of androgen deprivation therapy in the 1940s, there has long been intensive interest in the basic mechanisms underlying prostate cancer initiation and progression, as well as the potential to target these processes for therapeutic intervention. Here, we present an overview of major themes in prostate cancer research, focusing on current knowledge of principal events in cancer initiation and progression. We discuss recent advances, including new insights into the mechanisms of castration resistance, identification of stem cells and tumor-initiating cells, and development of mouse models for preclinical evaluation of novel therapuetics. Overall, we highlight the tremendous research progress made in recent years, and underscore the challenges that lie ahead.",

        "Abstract": "Arsenic contamination of ground water affects the health of millions of people worldwide. Bioremediation has the potential to lower contaminant levels in cases where physical methods are either ineffective or cost prohibitive. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered for enhanced arsenite accumulation by overexpression of transporters responsible for the influx of the contaminant. The transporter genes FPS1 and HXT7 were cloned under the control of the late-phase ADH2-promoter. This allowed for protein production at high biomass levels without the addition of inducer. Following the transfer of stationary phase cells to buffer, the engineered strains were capable of 3-4-fold greater arsenic uptake as compared to control cells. Further, at trace levels of the metalloid, the cells overexpressing the Fps1p transporter removed ca. 40% more arsenite from the extracellular medium than the controls. Arsenic uptake was also evaluated in cells overexpressing the transporters coupled with high-level production of cytosolic As sequestors (phytochelatins or bacterial ArsRp) to act as an intracellular sink. This led to an up to 4-fold increase in As accumulation in the resting cell culture as compared to native cells. The results demonstrate important steps needed to engineer a yeast biosorbent with enhanced accumulation capabilities for this metalloid.",

        "Abstract": "Prior epidemiologic studies have shown that increasing body mass index (BMI) is associated with higher total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL). However, these studies were limited by underrepresentation of obese subjects. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an association between BMI and lipid profiles in a population of patients with a broad spectrum of BMI values. A case-control study was performed involving patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic Florida. Cases (BMI >30 kg/m(2)) were obtained from the obesity surgery database between August 31, 2000, and April 4, 2002. Controls (BMI \u2264 30 kg/m(2)) were obtained from a database of primary care physicians between May 1, 2004, and November 18, 2004. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationship between BMI and lipid fractions. Multiple linear regression was performed to assess the independent effect of BMI on lipid levels while adjusting for potential confounders and propensity scores. Six hundred thirty-seven patients were analyzed (females, n = 362, 57%). There was no association between higher BMI and LDL (r = 0.19 p = 0.07), a negative association with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL; r = 0.45, p < 0.001), and a positive association with the log transformation of triglycerides (r = 0.32, p = 0.005).Higher BMI was inversely associated with HDL and directly associated with TG. BMI showed no significant association with LDL. Although the association between BMI and both HDL and TG may be explained by insulin resistance, the lack of a significant association between BMI and LDL remains an unexpected finding that requires further investigation.",

        "Title": "Functional redundancy of EGF-CFC genes in epiblast and extraembryonic patterning during early mouse embryogenesis.",
        "Abstract": "During early mouse embryogenesis, multiple patterning and differentiation events require the activity of Nodal, a ligand of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) family. Although Nodal signaling is known to require activity of EGF-CFC co-receptors in many contexts, it has been unclear whether all Nodal signaling in the early mouse embryo is EGF-CFC dependent. We have investigated the double null mutant phenotypes for the EGF-CFC genes Cripto and Cryptic, which encode co-receptors for Nodal, and have found that they have partially redundant functions in early mouse development. Expression of Cripto and Cryptic is non-overlapping prior to gastrulation, since Cripto is expressed solely in the epiblast whereas Cryptic is expressed in the primitive endoderm of the late blastocyst and the visceral endoderm after implantation. Despite these non-overlapping expression patterns, Cripto; Cryptic double mutants display severe defects in epiblast, extraembryonic ectoderm, and anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), resulting in phenotypes that are highly similar to those of Nodal null mutants. Our results indicate that both Cripto and Cryptic function non-cell-autonomously during normal development, and that most if not all Nodal activity in early mouse embryogenesis is EGF-CFC-dependent.",

        "Abstract": "More than 10 million people, many elderly and likely to harbor cardiovascular (CV) disease, embark on cruise ship travel worldwide every year. The clinical presentation and outcome of CV emergencies presenting during cruise ship travel remain largely unknown. Our department provides contracted cardiology consultations to several large cruise lines. We prospectively maintained a registry of all such consultations during a 2-year period. One hundred consecutive patients were identified (age 66 +/- 14 years, range 18 to 90, 76% men). The most common symptom was chest pain (50%). The most common diagnosis was acute coronary syndrome (58%; ST elevation in 21% and non-ST elevation in 37%). On-board mortality was 3%. Overall, 73% of patients required hospital triage. Of the 25 patients triaged to our institution, 17 underwent a revascularization procedure. One patient died. Ten percent of patients had cardiac symptoms in the days or weeks before boarding; all required hospital triage. Access to a baseline electrocardiogram would have been clinically useful in 23% of cases. In conclusion, CV emergencies, such as acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, are not uncommon on cruise ships. They are often serious, requiring hospital triage and coronary revascularization. A pretravel medical evaluation is recommended for passengers with a cardiac history or a high-risk profile. Passengers should be encouraged to bring a copy of their electrocardiogram on board if abnormal. Cruise lines should establish mechanisms for prompt consultation and triage.",

        "Abstract": "In epithelial tissues, the lineage relationship between normal progenitor cells and cell type(s) of origin for cancer has been poorly understood. Here we show that a known regulator of prostate epithelial differentiation, the homeobox gene Nkx3-1, marks a stem cell population that functions during prostate regeneration. Genetic lineage-marking demonstrates that rare luminal cells that express Nkx3-1 in the absence of testicular androgens (castration-resistant Nkx3-1-expressing cells, CARNs) are bipotential and can self-renew in vivo, and single-cell transplantation assays show that CARNs can reconstitute prostate ducts in renal grafts. Functional assays of Nkx3-1 mutant mice in serial prostate regeneration suggest that Nkx3-1 is required for stem cell maintenance. Furthermore, targeted deletion of the Pten tumour suppressor gene in CARNs results in rapid carcinoma formation after androgen-mediated regeneration. These observations indicate that CARNs represent a new luminal stem cell population that is an efficient target for oncogenic transformation in prostate cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Although bladder cancer represents a serious health problem worldwide, relevant mouse models for investigating disease progression or therapeutic targets have been lacking. We show that combined deletion of p53 and Pten in bladder epithelium leads to invasive cancer in a novel mouse model. Inactivation of p53 and PTEN promotes tumorigenesis in human bladder cells and is correlated with poor survival in human tumors. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of p53 and Pten deletion are mediated by deregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, consistent with the ability of rapamycin to block bladder tumorigenesis in preclinical studies. Our integrated analyses of mouse and human bladder cancer provide a rationale for investigating mTOR inhibition for treatment of patients with invasive disease.",

        "Title": "Monomethylation of histone H4-lysine 20 is involved in chromosome structure and stability and is essential for mouse development.",
        "Abstract": "PR-Set7/Set8/KMT5A is the sole enzyme known to catalyze monomethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20) and is present only in multicellular organisms that compact a large fraction of their DNA. We found that mouse embryos that are homozygous null mutants for the gene PR-Set7 display early embryonic lethality prior to the eight-cell stage. Death was due to the absence of PR-Set7 catalytic activity, since microinjection of the wild type, but not a catalytically inactive version, into two-cell embryos rescued the phenotype. A lack of PR-Set7 activity resulted not only in depletion of H4K20me1 but also in reduced levels of the H4K20me2/3 marks catalyzed by the Suv4-20h1/h2 enzymes, implying that H4K20me1 may be essential for the function of these enzymes to ensure the dimethylated and trimethylated states. Embryonic stem cells that were inducibly deleted for PR-Set7 passed through an initial G(2)/M phase, but the progeny were defective at the subsequent S and G(2)/M phases, exhibiting a delay in their cell cycle, accumulation at G(2)/M, massive DNA damage, and improper mitotic chromosome condensation. Cell cycle analysis after synchronization indicated that the defects were a consequence of decreased H4K20me1 due to the absence of PR-Set7. Most importantly, the lack of H4K20me1 also resulted in defects in chromosome condensation in interphase nuclei. These results demonstrate the critical role of H4K20 monomethylation in mammals in a developmental context.",

        "Abstract": "To comment that cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is an exciting tool in the evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD) is an understatement. As a new method, however, differing clinical and reimbursement guidelines exist to guide the use of the method, resulting in confusion among referring and interpreting physicians in whether CCTA is reasonably indicated and covered by an individual patient's payer. Such confusion has slowed the acceptance of CCTA within the medical community. Clinical and reimbursement guidelines related to CCTA indications, including those from public and private payers, are reviewed, summarized, and compared in text and table formats. The commonalities extant within medical society guidelines and gradually within the payer community allow the increasingly frequent use of CCTA for certain indications. Challenges to full-fledged acceptance of the technique based on guideline and payer policies are reviewed and are increasingly being overcome.",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies of epithelial cell growth and differentiation in the prostate gland have identified the homeodomain protein Nkx3.1 as a central regulator of prostate development and carcinogenesis. To understand the molecular mechanisms of Nkx3.1 function, we have used yeast two-hybrid analysis to identify Nkx3.1 interacting proteins, and have isolated Fem1b, a mammalian homolog of the C. elegans sex-determining gene Fem-1. In mice, the Fem1b and Nkx3.1 genes encode proteins that interact in glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, and are co-expressed in the prostate and testis of neonatal mice. Null mutants for Fem1b generated by gene targeting display defects in prostate ductal morphogenesis and secretory protein expression, similar to phenotypes found in Nkx3.1 mutants. We propose that Fem1b may have a conserved role in the generation of sexual dimorphism through its interaction with Nkx3.1 in the developing prostate gland.",

        "Abstract": "Mechanisms of androgen dependence of the prostate are critical to understanding prostate cancer progression to androgen independence associated with disease mortality. Transient elevation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) occurs after androgen ablation. To determine the role of TGF-beta on prostate response to androgen ablation, conditional TGF-beta type II receptor knockout mouse models of the epithelia (Tgfbr2(NKX3.1KO)) and stromal fibroblasts (Tgfbr2(fspKO)) were used. After castration, the prostates of Tgfbr2(NKX3.1KO) mice had apoptosis levels similar to those expected for control Tgfbr2(floxE2/floxE2) mice. Prostates of Tgfbr2(fspKO) mice, however, had reduced regression and high levels of proliferation associated with canonical Wnt activity throughout the glandular epithelia regardless of androgen status. In contrast, Tgfbr2(floxE2/floxE2) prostates had epithelial canonical Wnt activity only in the surviving proximal ducts after castration. In vitro studies showed that androgen antagonist, bicalutamide, transiently elevated both Tgfbr2(floxE2/floxE2) and Tgfbr2(fspKO) stromal expression of Wnt-2, Wnt-3a, and Wnt-5a. The neutralization of Wnt signaling by the expression of secreted frizzled related protein-2 (SFRP-2) resulted in decreased LNCaP prostate epithelial cell proliferation in stromal conditioned media transfer experiments. In vivo tissue recombination studies using Tgfbr2(fspKO) prostatic stromal cells in combination with wild-type or SV40 large T antigen expressing epithelia resulted in prostates that were refractile to androgen ablation. The expression of SFRP-2 restored the Tgfbr2(fspKO)-associated prostate responsiveness to androgen ablation. These studies reveal a novel TGF-beta, androgen, and Wnt paracrine signaling axis that enables prostatic regression of the distal ducts after androgen ablation while supporting proximal duct survival.",

In the prostate, the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene plays an important role in normal differentiation of the prostatic epithelium while its loss of function is an initiating event in prostate carcinogenesis in both mouse models and human patients. Thus, the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene provides a paradigm for understanding the relationship between normal differentiation and cancer, as well as studying the roles of homeobox genes in these processes. Here, we review recent findings concerning the roles of Nkx3.1 in development and discuss how its normal function is disrupted in processes of early prostate carcinogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "To identify biomarkers that discriminate the aggressive forms of prostate cancer, we performed gene expression profiling of prostate tumors using a genetically engineered mouse model that recapitulates the stages of human prostate cancer, namely Nkx3.1; Pten mutant mice. We observed a significant deregulation of the epidermal growth factor and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, as well as their major downstream effectors--the activator protein-1 transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun. Forced expression of c-Fos and c-Jun in prostate cancer cells promotes tumorigenicity and results in activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) MAPK signaling. In human prostate cancer, up-regulation of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins occurs in advanced disease and is correlated with Erk MAPK pathway activation, whereas high levels of c-Jun expression are associated with disease recurrence. Our analyses reveal a hitherto unappreciated role for AP-1 transcription factors in prostate cancer progression and identify c-Jun as a marker of high-risk prostate cancer. This study provides a striking example of how accurate mouse models can provide insights on molecular processes involved in progression and recurrence of human cancer.",

        "Abstract": "The mammalian prostate arises from the urogenital sinus and few factors have been identified to be important in the early stages of prostate development. In this study we show that the transcription factor Sox9 is expressed in the epithelia of all mouse prostatic lobes from the initial stages of their development. We used a conditional approach with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of Nkx3.1 regulatory sequences to delete Sox9 from the developing prostate. Mice with a prostate specific deletion of Sox9 showed a lack of ventral prostate development and abnormal anterior prostate differentiation. Analysis of these mutant animals revealed an early loss of expression of genes specific to the prostate epithelia such as Nkx3.1 and Shh and a marked reduction in proliferation in the ventral prostate but not in other lobes. Fgf signalling, through the MAPK pathway, has been shown to be important in prostate development and a lobe specific phenotype was reported for a prostate specific Fgfr2 mutant mouse model. Here we show that the levels of Fgfr2 and Sprouty2, a downstream target of Fgf signalling, were severely reduced in the ventral prostate of Sox9 mutant animals but not in other lobes. Prostate organ culture studies with a Mek inhibitor, U0126, and a Fgf receptor inhibitor, SU5402, indicate that the timing of expression of Cre in the mutant animals could account for the lobe specific phenotype in the Sox9 and Fgfr2 mutants. These studies imply that Sox9 is required for the early differentiation of the prostate bud epithelia.",

        "Abstract": "The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) regulates a broad spectrum of biological activities by activation of transmembrane FGF receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinases and their coupled intracellular signaling pathways. FGF receptor substrate 2alpha (FRS2alpha) is an FGFR interactive adaptor protein that links multiple signaling pathways to the activated FGFR kinase. We previously showed that FGFR2 in the prostate epithelium is important for branching morphogenesis and for the acquisition of the androgen responsiveness. Here we show in mice that FRS2alpha is uniformly expressed in the epithelial cells of developing prostates, whereas it is expressed only in basal cells of the mature prostate epithelium. However, expression of FRS2alpha was apparent in luminal epithelial cells of regenerating prostates and prostate tumors. To investigate FRS2alpha function in the prostate, the Frs2alpha alleles were ablated specifically in the prostatic epithelial precursor cells during prostate development. Similar to the ablation of Fgfr2, ablation of Frs2alpha disrupted MAP kinase activation, impaired prostatic ductal branching morphogenesis and compromised cell proliferation. Unlike the Fgfr2 ablation, disrupting Frs2alpha had no effect on the response of the prostate to androgens. More importantly, ablation of Frs2alpha inhibited prostatic tumorigenesis induced by oncogenic viral proteins. The results suggest that FRS2alpha-mediated signals in prostate epithelial cells promote branching morphogenesis and proliferation, and that aberrant activation of FRS2-linked pathways might promote tumorigenesis. Thus, the prostate-specific Frs2alpha(cn) mice provide a useful animal model for scrutinizing the molecular mechanisms underlying prostatic development and tumorigenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Situs-specific organogenesis in the mouse results from leftward fluid flow in the node cavity and subsequent left-sided expression of Nodal in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM). Nodal expression at the node is essential for the subsequent asymmetric Nodal expression in the left LPM, but the precise role of Nodal produced at the node has remained unknown. We have now investigated how the Nodal signal is transferred from the node to the LPM. Externally supplied Nodal protein failed to signal to the LPM, suggesting that the Nodal signal is transferred to the LPM via an internal route rather than an external one. Transgenic rescue experiments showed that the Nodal co-receptor Cryptic (Cfc1) is required only in the LPM, not at the node, for asymmetric Nodal expression in the LPM, indicating that the Nodal signal is not relayed indirectly between the node and LPM. Nodal interacts in vitro with sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are specifically localized to the basement membrane-like structure between the node and LPM in the mouse embryo. Inhibition of sulfated GAG biosynthesis prevents Nodal expression in the LPM. These data suggest that Nodal produced at the node might travel directly to the LPM via interaction with sulfated GAGs.",

        "Abstract": "The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family consists of 22 members and regulates a broad spectrum of biological activities by activating diverse isotypes of FGF receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFRs). Among the FGFs, FGF7 and FGF10 have been implicated in the regulation of prostate development and prostate tissue homeostasis by signaling through the FGFR2 isoform. Using conditional gene ablation with the Cre-LoxP system in mice, we demonstrate a tissue-specific requirement for FGFR2 in urogenital epithelial cells--the precursors of prostatic epithelial cells--for prostatic branching morphogenesis and prostatic growth. Most Fgfr2 conditional null (Fgfr2(cn)) embryos developed only two dorsal prostatic (dp) and two lateral prostatic (lp) lobes. This contrasts to wild-type prostate, which has two anterior prostatic (ap), two dp, two lp and two ventral prostatic (vp) lobes. Unlike wild-type prostates, which are composed of well developed epithelial ductal networks, the Fgfr2(cn) prostates, despite retaining a compartmented tissue structure, exhibited a primitive epithelial architecture. Moreover, although Fgfr2(cn) prostates continued to produce secretory proteins in an androgen-dependent manner, they responded poorly to androgen with respect to tissue homeostasis. The results demonstrate that FGFR2 is important for prostate organogenesis and for the prostate to develop into a strictly androgen-dependent organ with respect to tissue homeostasis but not to the secretory function, implying that androgens may regulate tissue homeostasis and tissue function differently. Therefore, Fgfr2(cn) prostates provide a useful animal model for scrutinizing molecular mechanisms by which androgens regulate prostate growth, homeostasis and function, and may yield clues as to how advanced-tumor prostate cells escape strict androgen regulations.",

        "Abstract": "Androgen independence is responsible for most prostate cancer lethality, yet currently there are no effective clinical treatments. We have been investigating the mechanisms underlying androgen-independent prostate cancer in Nkx3.1;Pten mutant mice, which display salient features of the disease, including a requirement for wild-type androgen receptor (AR) signaling. We now demonstrate that the Akt and Erk MAP kinase signaling pathways are activated in androgen-independent lesions of these mice. Forced activation of either Akt or Erk signaling in an androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line promotes hormone-independent but AR-dependent growth in culture. Although these pathways act additively in culture, they act synergistically in vivo to promote tumorigenicity and androgen independence in the context of the prostate microenvironment. We propose that androgen independence emerges by means of epithelial-stromal competition, in which activation of Akt and Erk promotes AR activity in the prostate epithelium while counteracting antagonistic effects of the stroma.",

        "Abstract": "Although androgen deprivation therapy is a widely used treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer, it ultimately results in the emergence of a hormone-refractory disease that is invariably fatal. To provide insights into the genesis of this disease, we have employed an in vivo model to investigate how and when prostate epithelial cells can acquire the ability to survive and proliferate in the absence of androgens. In particular, we have been studying the evolution of androgen independence in Nkx3.1; Pten mutant mice, which develop prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma as a consequence of aging, as well as androgen-independent phenotypes following castration. We now find that the prostate epithelial cells from these Nkx3.1; Pten mutant mice are capable of surviving and proliferating in the absence of androgens and that they develop androgen-independent phenotypes well before they display overt prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer phenotypes. Our findings in this mouse model show that acquisition of androgen independence can be uncoupled from overt cancer progression and raise the possibility that hormone-refractory disease can arise at early stages of prostate carcinogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Pitx2 is expressed in developing visceral organs on the left side and is implicated in left-right (LR) asymmetric organogenesis. The asymmetric expression of Pitx2 is controlled by an intronic enhancer (ASE) that contains multiple Foxh1-binding sites and an Nkx2-binding site. These binding sites are essential and sufficient for asymmetric enhancer activity and are evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates. We now show that mice that lack the ASE of Pitx2 (Pitx2(Delta)(ASE/)(Delta)(ASE) mice) fail to manifest left-sided Pitx2 expression and exhibit laterality defects in most visceral organs, although the position of the stomach and heart looping remain unaffected. Asymmetric Pitx2 expression in some domains, such as the common cardinal vein, was found to be induced by Nodal signaling but to be independent of the ASE of Pitx2. Expression of Pitx2 appears to be repressed in a large portion of the heart ventricle and atrioventricular canal of wild-type mice by a negative feedback mechanism at a time when the gene is still expressed in its other domains. Rescue of the early phase of asymmetric Pitx2 expression in the left lateral plate of Pitx2(Delta)(ASE/)(Delta)(ASE) embryos was not sufficient to restore normal organogenesis, suggesting that continuous expression of Pitx2 in the lineage of the left lateral plate is required for situs-specific organogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "The formation of the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) in the pre-gastrulation mouse embryo represents a crucial event in patterning of the anterior-posterior axis. Here, we show that the transforming growth factor beta (Tgfbeta) family member Gdf3 (growth-differentiation factor 3), a close relative of Xenopus Vg1, resembles the Tgfbeta ligand Nodal in both its signaling activity and its role in AVE formation in vivo. Thus, in cell culture, Gdf3 signaling requires the EGF-CFC co-receptor Cripto and can be inhibited by Lefty antagonists. In Xenopus embryos, Gdf3 misexpression results in secondary axis formation, and induces morphogenetic elongation and mesendoderm formation in animal caps. In mouse embryos, Gdf3 is expressed in the inner cell mass and epiblast, and null mutants frequently exhibit abnormal formation or positioning of the AVE. This phenotype correlates with defects in mesoderm and definitive endoderm formation, as well as abnormal Nodal expression levels. Our findings indicate that Gdf3 acts in a Nodal-like signaling pathway in pre-gastrulation development, and provide evidence for the functional conservation of Vg1 activity in mice.",

        "Title": "Non-cell-autonomous role for Cripto in axial midline formation during vertebrate embryogenesis.",
        "Abstract": "Several membrane-associated proteins are known to modulate the activity and range of potent morphogenetic signals during development. In particular, members of the EGF-CFC family encode glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins that are essential for activity of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) ligand Nodal, a factor that plays a central role in establishing the vertebrate body plan. Genetic and biochemical studies have indicated that EGF-CFC proteins function as cell-autonomous co-receptors for Nodal; by contrast, cell culture data have suggested that the mammalian EGF-CFC protein Cripto can act as a secreted signaling factor. Here we show that Cripto acts non-cell-autonomously during axial mesendoderm formation in the mouse embryo and may possess intercellular signaling activity in vivo. Phenotypic analysis of hypomorphic mutants demonstrates that Cripto is essential for formation of the notochordal plate, prechordal mesoderm and foregut endoderm during gastrulation. Remarkably, Cripto null mutant cells readily contribute to these tissues in chimeras, indicating non-cell-autonomy. Consistent with these loss-of-function analyses, gain-of-function experiments in chick embryos show that exposure of node/head process mesoderm to soluble Cripto protein results in alterations in cell fates toward anterior mesendoderm, in a manner that is dependent on Nodal signaling. Taken together, our findings support a model in which Cripto can function in trans as an intercellular mediator of Nodal signaling activity.",

        "Abstract": "Activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptors typically elicits mesodermal development, whereas inhibition of this pathway induces neural fates. In vitro differentiated mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with deletion of the TGF-beta pathway-related factors Smad4 or Cripto exhibited increased numbers of neurons. Cripto-/- ES cells developed into neuroecto-/epidermal cell types, while Smad4-/- cells also displayed mesodermal differentiation. ES cell differentiation into catecholaminergic neurons showed that these ES cells retained their ability to develop into dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons with typical expression patterns of midbrain and hindbrain genes. In vivo, transplanted ES cells to the mouse striatum became small neuronal grafts, or large grafts with cell types from all germ layers independent of their ES cell genotype. This demonstrates that Smad4-/- and Cripto-/- ES cells favor a neural fate in vitro, but also express the mesodermal phenotype, implying that deletion of either Smad4 or Cripto is not sufficient to block nonneuronal tissue formation.",

        "Abstract": "Asymmetric expression of Nodal in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) plays the major role in left-right (L-R) patterning. A Nodal-responsive enhancer located in the intron 1 (ASE) regulates asymmetric Nodal expression, but it is unknown how Nodal expression is initiated in the left LPM. Here, we have identified a second asymmetric enhancer (left side-specific enhancer, LSE) in the upstream region of mouse Nodal gene. LSE is also located in the corresponding region of human NODAL. L-R specificity of LSE is affected by iv and inv mutations. The requirement of a conserved FoxH1-binding sequence for LSE activity and the dependence of LSE activity on Nodal coreceptor Cryptic indicate that LSE is activated by Nodal signal. However, the mutant mouse lacking LSE does not show obvious L-R patterning defects. These results suggest that Nodal expression in the left LPM is induced by a combination of two Nodal-responsive autoregulatory enhancers, ASE and LSE.",

Our recent studies of a mouse model of prostate carcinogenesis have revealed that cancer progression is enhanced by a two-fold reduction in p27kip1 gene dosage, but is unexpectedly inhibited by further decrease in p27kip1 activity. This paradoxical finding may explain the unusual features of p27kip1 downregulation in human cancer, and also suggests a potential route for therapeutic intervention.",

        "Abstract": "In human prostate cancer, the frequent down-regulation of p27(kip1) protein expression is correlated with poor clinical outcome, yet p27(kip1) rarely undergoes mutational inactivation. Here, we investigate the consequences of reducing or eliminating p27(kip1) function for prostate carcinogenesis in the context of a mouse modeling lacking the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene and the Pten tumor suppressor. Unexpectedly, we find that triple mutant mice heterozygous for a p27(kip1) null allele (Nkx3.1(+/- or -/-); Pten(+/-); p27(+/-)) display enhanced prostate carcinogenesis, whereas mice that are homozygous null for p27(kip1) (Nkx3.1(+/- or -/-); Pten(+/-); p27(-/-)) show inhibition of cancer progression. Expression profiling reveals that Cyclin D1 is highly up-regulated in compound p27(kip1) heterozygotes, but is down-regulated in the compound p27(kip1) homozygous mutants. Using RNA interference in prostate cancer cell lines with distinct p27(kip1) gene doses, we show that prostate tumorigenicity depends on levels of p27(kip1) and that the consequences of p27(kip1) gene dosage can be attributed, in part, to altered levels of Cyclin D1. Our findings suggest that p27(kip1) possesses dosage-sensitive positive as well as negative modulatory roles in prostate cancer progression.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in the CLN2 gene, which encodes a lysosomal serine protease, tripeptidyl-peptidase I (TPP I), result in an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease of children, classical late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (cLINCL). cLINCL is inevitably fatal, and there currently exists no cure or effective treatment. In this report, we provide the characterization of the first CLN2-targeted mouse model for cLINCL. CLN2-targeted mice were fertile and apparently healthy at birth despite an absence of detectable TPP I activity. At approximately 7 weeks of age, neurological deficiencies became evident with the onset of a tremor that became progressively more severe and was eventually accompanied by ataxia. Lifespan of the affected mice was greatly reduced (median survival, 138 d), and extensive neuronal pathology was observed including a prominent accumulation of cytoplasmic storage material within the lysosomal-endosomal compartment, a loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells, and widespread axonal degeneration. The CLN2-targeted mouse therefore recapitulates much of the pathology and clinical features of cLINCL and represents an animal model that should provide clues to the normal cellular function of TPP I and the pathogenic processes that underlie neuronal death in its absence. In addition, the CLN2-targeted mouse also represents a valuable model for the evaluation of different therapeutic strategies.",

        "Abstract": "During vertebrate retinogenesis, seven classes of cells are specified from multipotent progenitors. To date, the mechanisms underlying multipotent cell fate determination by retinal progenitors remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the Foxn4 winged helix/forkhead transcription factor is expressed in a subset of mitotic progenitors during mouse retinogenesis. Targeted disruption of Foxn4 largely eliminates amacrine neurons and completely abolishes horizontal cells, while overexpression of Foxn4 strongly promotes an amacrine cell fate. These results indicate that Foxn4 is both necessary and sufficient for commitment to the amacrine cell fate and is nonredundantly required for the genesis of horizontal cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Foxn4 controls the formation of amacrine and horizontal cells by activating the expression of the retinogenic factors Math3, NeuroD1, and Prox1. Our data suggest a model in which Foxn4 cooperates with other key retinogenic factors to mediate the multipotent differentiation of retinal progenitors.",

        "Abstract": "Niemann-Pick C (NPC) disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids within the cells of patients. Clinically identical forms of NPC disease are caused by defects in either of two different proteins: NPC1, a lysosomal-endosomal transmembrane protein and NPC2, a soluble lysosomal protein with cholesterol binding properties. Although it is clear that NPC1 and NPC2 are required for the egress of lipids from the lysosome, the precise roles of these proteins in this process is unknown. To gain insight into the normal function of NPC2 and to investigate its interactions, if any, with NPC1, we have generated a murine NPC2 hypomorph that expresses 0-4% residual protein in different tissues and have examined its phenotype in the presence and absence of NPC1. The phenotypes of NPC1 and NPC2 single mutants and an NPC1;NPC2 double mutant are similar or identical in terms of disease onset and progression, pathology, neuronal storage, and biochemistry of lipid accumulation. These findings provide genetic evidence that the NPC1 and NPC2 proteins function in concert to facilitate the intracellular transport of lipids from the lysosome to other cellular sites.",

        "Title": "Two modes by which Lefty proteins inhibit nodal signaling.",
        "Abstract": "During vertebrate embryogenesis, members of the Lefty subclass of Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGFbeta) proteins act as extracellular antagonists of the signaling pathway for Nodal, a TGFbeta-related ligand essential for mesendoderm formation and left-right patterning. Genetic and biochemical analyses have shown that Nodal signaling is mediated by activin receptors but also requires EGF-CFC coreceptors, such as mammalian Cripto or Cryptic. Misexpression experiments in zebrafish and frogs have suggested that Lefty proteins can act as long-range inhibitors for Nodal, possibly through competition for binding to activin receptors. Here we demonstrate two distinct and unexpected mechanisms by which Lefty proteins can antagonize Nodal activity. In particular, using a novel assay for Lefty activity in mammalian cell culture, we find that Lefty can inhibit signaling by Nodal but not by Activin or TGFbeta1, which are EGF-CFC independent. We show that Lefty can interact with Nodal in solution and thereby block Nodal from binding to activin receptors. Furthermore, Lefty can also interact with EGF-CFC proteins and prevent their ability to form part of a Nodal receptor complex. Our results provide mechanistic insights into how Lefty proteins can achieve efficient and stringent regulation of a potent signaling factor.",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays a critical role in the development and patterning of many endodermally derived tissues. We have investigated the role of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in formation of the prostate gland by examining the urogenital phenotype of Shh mutant fetuses. Consistent with earlier work reporting an essential role for Shh in prostate induction, we have found that Shh mutant fetuses display abnormal urogenital development and fail to form prostate buds. Unexpectedly, however, we have discovered that this prostate defect could be rescued by three different methods: renal grafting, explant culture in the presence of androgens, and administration of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to pregnant mice, indicating that the prostate defect in Shh mutants is due to insufficient levels of androgens. Furthermore, we find that the inhibition of Hh pathway signaling by treatment with cyclopamine does not block prostate formation in explant culture, but instead produces morphological defects consistent with a role for Hh signaling in ductal patterning. Taken together, our studies indicate that the initial organogenesis of the prostate proceeds independently of Shh, but that Shh or other Hh ligands may play a role in subsequent events that pattern the prostate.",

        "Abstract": "Although it is often presumed that the molecular pathways that underlie normal organogenesis are similar to those perturbed during carcinogenesis, few examples exist of tissue-specific regulatory genes that play central roles in both processes. In the case of the prostate gland, molecular genetic analyses have demonstrated that the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene plays an important role in normal differentiation of the prostatic epithelium and that its loss of function is an initiating event in prostate carcinogenesis. Thus, the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene provides a paradigm for understanding the relationship between normal differentiation and cancer, as well as a model for studying the roles of homeobox genes in these processes. Here, we review recent findings concerning the biological as well as biochemical function of this central regulator of prostate development and carcinogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "To begin to reconcile models of floor plate formation in the vertebrate neural tube, we have performed experiments aimed at understanding the development of the early floor plate in the chick embryo. Using real-time analyses of cell behaviour, we provide evidence that the principal contributor to the early neural midline, the future anterior floor plate, exists as a separate population of floor plate precursor cells in the epiblast of the gastrula stage embryo, and does not share a lineage with axial mesoderm. Analysis of the tissue interactions associated with differentiation of these cells to a floor plate fate reveals a role for the nascent prechordal mesoderm, indicating that more than one inductive event is associated with floor plate formation along the length of the neuraxis. We show that Nr1, a chick nodal homologue, is expressed in the nascent prechordal mesoderm and we provide evidence that Nodal signalling can cooperate with Shh to induce the epiblast precursors to a floor-plate fate. These results indicate that a shared lineage with axial mesoderm cells is not a pre-requisite for floor plate differentiation and suggest parallels between the development of the floor plate in amniote and anamniote embryos.",

Here, we have investigated the malignant potential of the high-grade PIN lesions that form in Nkx3.1(+/-); Pten(+/-) compound mutant mice and demonstrate their neoplastic progression in a serial transplantation/tissue recombination assay. Furthermore, we find that a majority of Nkx3.1(+/-); Pten(+/-) mice greater than 1 year of age develop invasive adenocarcinoma, which is frequently accompanied by metastases to lymph nodes. Finally, we observe androgen independence of high-grade PIN lesions after androgen ablation of Nkx3.1(+/-); Pten(+/-) mice. We conclude that Nkx3.1(+/-); Pten(+/-) mice recapitulate key features of advanced prostate cancer and represent a useful model for investigating associated molecular mechanisms and for evaluating therapeutic approaches.",

        "Abstract": "Traditionally, the primary function of oligodendrocytes (OLGs) in the CNS has been considered to be myelination. Here, we investigated whether OLGs may play a trophic role, particularly during development. Neurotrophin expression was assessed in postnatal day 7 basal forebrain (BF) OLGs, using in situ hybridization and detection of myelin basic protein. Nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) mRNAs were revealed in OLGs in vivo and in culture. To determine whether OLGs support nearby neurons, we examined the influence of OLGs on BF cholinergic neurons. Neuronal function was enhanced by cocultured OLGs and OLG conditioned medium. Moreover, trophic effects of OLG conditioned medium were partially blocked by K252a, a trk tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and by neutralizing anti-BDNF or anti-NT-3 antisera, indicating that neurotrophins may mediate these effects, perhaps in concert with other signals. Our studies support a novel role for OLGs in providing local trophic support for neurons in the CNS.",

        "Abstract": "The formation and patterning of mesoderm during mammalian gastrulation require the activity of Nodal, a secreted mesoderm-inducing factor of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family. Here we show that the transcriptional corepressor DRAP1 has a very specific role in regulation of Nodal activity during mouse embryogenesis. We find that loss of Drap1 leads to severe gastrulation defects that are consistent with increased expression of Nodal and can be partially suppressed by Nodal heterozygosity. Biochemical studies indicate that DRAP1 interacts with and inhibits DNA binding by the winged-helix transcription factor FoxH1 (FAST), a critical component of a positive feedback loop for Nodal activity. We propose that DRAP1 limits the spread of a morphogenetic signal by down-modulating the response to the Nodal autoregulatory loop.",

        "Abstract": "Several mouse models of human prostate cancer were studied to identify and characterize potential precursor lesions containing foci of atypical epithelial cells. These lesions exhibit a sequence of changes suggesting progressive evolution toward malignancy. Based on these observations, a grading system is proposed to classify prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in genetically engineered mice (GEM). Four grades of GEM PIN are proposed based on their architecture, differentiation pattern, and degree of cytological atypia. PIN I lesions have one or two layers of atypical cells. PIN II has two or more layers of atypical cells. PIN III has large, pleomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and the cells tend to involve the entire lumen with expansion of the duct outlines. PIN IV lesions contain atypical cells that fill the lumen and bulge focally into, and frequently compromise, the fibromuscular sheath. Within the same cohorts, the lower grade PINs first appear earlier than the higher grades. Morphometric and immunohistochemical analyses confirm progressive change. Although the malignant potential of PIN IV in mice has not been proven, GEM PIN is similar to human PIN. This PIN classification system is a first step toward a systematic evaluation of the biological potential of these lesions in GEM.",

        "Abstract": "The cochlea of the mammalian inner ear contains three rows of outer hair cells and a single row of inner hair cells. These hair cell receptors reside in the organ of Corti and function to transduce mechanical stimuli into electrical signals that mediate hearing. To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of these delicate sensory hair cells are unknown. We report that targeted disruption of Barhl1, a mouse homolog of the Drosophila BarH homeobox genes, results in severe to profound hearing loss, providing a unique model for the study of age-related human deafness disorders. Barhl1 is expressed in all sensory hair cells during inner ear development, 2 days after the onset of hair cell generation. Loss of Barhl1 function in mice results in age-related progressive degeneration of both outer and inner hair cells in the organ of Corti, following two reciprocal longitudinal gradients. Our data together indicate an essential role for Barhl1 in the long-term maintenance of cochlear hair cells, but not in the determination or differentiation of these cells.",

        "Title": "Dual roles of Cripto as a ligand and coreceptor in the nodal signaling pathway.",
        "Abstract": "The EGF-CFC gene Cripto encodes an extracellular protein that has been implicated in the signaling pathway for the transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) ligand Nodal. Although recent findings in frog and fish embryos have suggested that EGF-CFC proteins function as coreceptors for Nodal, studies in cell culture have implicated Cripto as a growth factor-like signaling molecule. Here we reconcile these apparently disparate models of Cripto function by using a mammalian cell culture assay to investigate the signaling activities of Nodal and EGF-CFC proteins. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we found that Cripto has activities consistent with its being a coreceptor for Nodal. However, Cripto can also function as a secreted signaling factor in cell coculture assays, suggesting that it may also act as a coligand for Nodal. Furthermore, we found that the ability of Cripto to bind to Nodal and mediate Nodal signaling requires the addition of an O-linked fucose monosaccharide to a conserved site within EGF-CFC proteins. We propose a model in which Cripto has dual roles as a coreceptor as well as a coligand for Nodal and that this signaling interaction with Nodal is regulated by an unusual form of glycosylation. Our findings highlight the significance of extracellular modulation of ligand activity as an important means of regulating TGF beta signaling pathways during vertebrate development.",

Consistent with such a role, here we show that Nkx3.1 displays growth-suppressing activities in cell culture, and that aged Nkx3.1 mutant mice display histopathological defects resembling prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), the presumed precursor of human prostate cancer. Using a tissue recombination approach, we found that PIN-like lesions from Nkx3.1 mutants can undergo progressively severe histopathological alterations after serial transplantation in nude mice. Our findings indicate that Nkx3.1 loss-of-function is a critical event in prostate cancer initiation, and that Nkx3.1 mutant mice accurately model early stages of prostate carcinogenesis. More generally, our tissue recombination assay provides an empirical test to examine the relationship of PIN to prostate carcinoma.",

        "Abstract": "Mouse models have provided significant insights into the molecular mechanisms of tumor suppressor gene function. Here we use mouse models of prostate carcinogenesis to demonstrate that the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene undergoes epigenetic inactivation through loss of protein expression. Loss of function of Nkx3.1 in mice cooperates with loss of function of the Pten tumor suppressor gene in cancer progression. This cooperativity results in the synergistic activation of Akt (protein kinase B), a key modulator of cell growth and survival. Our findings underscore the significance of interactions between tissue-specific regulators such as Nkx3.1 and broad-spectrum tumor suppressors such as Pten in contributing to the distinct phenotypes of different cancers.",
