        "Abstract": "Simple physical models for restricted diffusion in a potential, which provide important insights for NMR spin relaxation, usually are based on free diffusion within rigid boundaries or diffusion in relatively simple continuous potential energy surfaces. The diffusion-in-a-cone model is an example of the former and diffusion in an N-fold cosine potential is an example of the latter. The present work models restricted diffusion for arbitrary potential energy functions on the surface of a cone or a sphere, by expanding the potentials in Fourier or spherical harmonic series, respectively. The results exhibit simple relationships between generalized order parameters and effective correlation times, critical for analysis of experimental spin relaxation data, and illustrate the transition from diffusive-like to jump-like behavior in multi-well potentials.",

        "Title": "Dynamical Models of Chemical Exchange in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.",
        "Abstract": "Chemical exchange line-broadening is an important phenomenon in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, in which a nuclear spin experiences more than one magnetic environment as a result of chemical or conformational changes of a molecule. The dynamic process of chemical exchange strongly affects the sensitivity and resolution of NMR experiments, and increasingly provides a powerful probe of the inter-conversion between chemical and conformational states of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biological macromolecules. A simple and often used theoretical description of chemical exchange in NMR spectroscopy is based on an idealized two-state jump model (the random-phase or telegraph signal). However, chemical exchange can also be represented as a barrier-crossing event that can be modeled using chemical reaction rate theory. The time scale of crossing is determined by the barrier height, the temperature, and the dissipation modeled as collisional or frictional damping. This tutorial explores the connection between the NMR theory of chemical exchange line-broadening and strong-collision models for chemical kinetics in statistical mechanics. Theoretical modeling and numerical simulation are used to map the rate of barrier-crossing dynamics of a particle on a potential energy surface to the chemical exchange relaxation rate constant. By developing explicit models for the exchange dynamics, the tutorial aims to elucidate the underlying dynamical processes that give rise to the rich phenomenology of chemical exchange observed in NMR spectroscopy. Software for generating and analyzing the numerical simulations is provided in the form of Python and Fortran source codes.",

The Euler angles in turn can be obtained from the solution of a Riccati differential equation; however, analytic solutions exist only for rectangular and chirp pulses. The Homotopy Analysis Method is used to obtain new approximate solutions to the Riccati equation for shaped radiofrequency pulses in NMR spectroscopy. The results of even relatively low orders of approximation are highly accurate and can be calculated very efficiently. The results are extended in a second application of the Homotopy Analysis Method to represent relaxation as a perturbation of the magnetization trajectory calculated in the absence of relaxation. The Homotopy Analysis Method is powerful and flexible and is likely to have other applications in magnetic resonance.",

Conserved Trp2 and Trp4 residues in type II cadherins anchor the EC1 A strand intermolecularly in strand-swapped dimers. Herein, NMR spectroscopy is used to elucidate the roles of Trp2 and Trp4 in Cadherin-11 dimerization. The monomeric state, with the A strand and Trp side chains packed intramolecularly, is in equilibrium with sparsely populated partially and fully A-strand-exposed states, in which Trp2 (and Trp4, respectively) side-chain packing is disrupted. Exchange kinetics between the major state and the partially (fully) A-strand-exposed state is slow-intermediate (intermediate-fast). A separate very fast process exchanges ordered and random-coil BC-loop conformations with populations dependent on A-strand exposure and dimerization status. In addition, very slow processes connect the folded A-strand-exposed conformation to partially unfolded states, which may represent additional domain-swapping intermediates. The dimerization mechanism of type II cadherins is revealed as coupled folding and strand swapping.",

While Piwi is the central piRNA factor, others including Asterix/Gtsf1 have also been demonstrated to be critical for effective silencing. Here, using enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) with a custom informatic pipeline, we show that Asterix/Gtsf1 specifically binds tRNAs in cellular contexts. We determined the structure of mouse Gtsf1 by NMR spectroscopy and identified the RNA-binding interface on the protein's first zinc finger, which was corroborated by biochemical analysis as well as cryo-EM structures of Gtsf1 in complex with co-purifying tRNA. Consistent with the known dependence of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons on tRNA primers, we demonstrate that LTR retrotransposons are, in fact, preferentially de-repressed in Asterix mutants. Together, these findings link Asterix/Gtsf1, tRNAs, and LTR retrotransposon silencing and suggest that Asterix exploits tRNA dependence to identify transposon transcripts and promote piRNA silencing.",

        "Abstract": "The Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) NMR relaxation dispersion experiment measures the effective relaxation rate constant during a train of spin-echo pulse sequence elements as a function of the echo time. The CPMG experiment is a powerful method for characterizing chemical and conformational dynamic processes, termed chemical and conformational exchange, on \u03bcs-ms time scales, comparable to the experimentally accessible echo times. Approximate theoretical expressions for the effective relaxation rate constant for N-site chemical exchange have been reported (H. Koss, M. Rance, and A. G. Palmer, Biochemistry 57, 4753-4763 (2018)). Expressions for the effective relaxation rate constant have been improved by using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem to obtain simple and accurate approximations of the average Liouvillian for the CPMG experiment. The improved accuracy of the results allows efficient analyses of experimental data. In addition, the relationship is clarified between the approach of Koss and coworkers and that of Jen (1978).",

Importantly, NMR methods based on a variety of spin relaxation parameters have been developed that provide quantitative information on interconversion kinetics, thermodynamic properties, and structural features of molecular states populated to a fraction of a percent at equilibrium and otherwise unobservable by other NMR approaches. The ongoing development of more sophisticated experimental techniques and the necessity to apply these methods to larger and more complex molecular systems engenders a corresponding need for theoretical advances describing such techniques and facilitating data analysis in applications. This review surveys current aspects of the theory of chemical exchange, as utilized in ZZ-exchange; Hahn and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) spin-echo; and R",

        "Abstract": "Spin relaxation in solution-state NMR spectroscopy is a powerful approach to explore the conformational dynamics of biological macromolecules. Probability distribution functions for overall or internal correlation times have been used previously to model spectral density functions central to spin-relaxation theory. Applications to biological macromolecules rely on transverse relaxation rate constants, and when studying nanosecond timescale motions, sampling at ultralow frequencies is often necessary. Consequently, appropriate distribution functions necessitate spectral density functions that are accurate and convergent as frequencies approach zero. In this work, the inverse Gaussian probability distribution function is derived from general properties of spectral density functions at low and high frequencies for macromolecules in solution, using the principle of maximal entropy. This normalized distribution function is first used to calculate the correlation function, followed by the spectral density function. The resulting model-free spectral density functions are finite at a frequency of zero and can be used to describe distributions of either overall or internal correlation times using the model-free ansatz. To validate the approach, ",

Optimality of this formula is proven for non-sparse sets of coherence levels with relatively prime lower absolute bounds. Smaller phase cycles can be constructed when these conditions do not hold. The resultant formula can be incorporated into NMR spectrometer software to automatically generate cogwheel phase cycles.",

        "Abstract": "Transcription factors bind to their binding sites over a wide range of affinities, yet how differences in affinity are encoded in DNA sequences is not well understood. Here, we report X-ray crystal structures of four heterodimers of the Hox protein AbdominalB bound with its cofactor Extradenticle to four target DNA molecules that differ in affinity by up to \u223c20-fold. Remarkably, despite large differences in affinity, the overall structures are very similar in all four complexes. In contrast, the predicted shapes of the DNA binding sites (i.e., the intrinsic DNA shape) in the absence of bound protein are strikingly different from each other and correlate with affinity: binding sites that must change conformations upon protein binding have lower affinities than binding sites that have more optimal conformations prior to binding. Together, these observations suggest that intrinsic differences in DNA shape provide a robust mechanism for modulating affinity without affecting other protein-DNA interactions.",

        "Abstract": "The Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) nuclear magnetic resonance experiment is widely used to characterize chemical exchange phenomena in biological macromolecules. Theoretical expressions for the nuclear spin relaxation rate constant for two-site chemical exchange during CPMG pulse trains valid for all time scales are well-known as are descriptions of N-site exchange in the fast limit. We have obtained theoretical expressions for N-site exchange outside of the fast limit by using approximations to an average Liouvillian describing the decay of magnetization during a CPMG pulse train. We obtain general expressions for CPMG experiments for any N-site scheme and all experimentally accessible time scales. For sufficiently slow chemical exchange, we obtain closed-form expressions for the relaxation rate constant and a general characteristic polynomial for arbitrary kinetic schemes. Furthermore, we highlight features that qualitatively characterize CPMG curves obtained for various N-site kinetic topologies, quantitatively characterize CPMG curves obtained from systems in various N-site exchange situations, and test distinguishability of kinetic models.",

Herein, molecular dynamics simulations are used to predict in vitro thermostability of members of the bacterial ribonuclease HI (RNase H) family of endonucleases. The temperature dependence of the generalized order parameter, S, for four RNase H homologues, from psychrotrophic, mesophilic, and thermophilic organisms, is highly correlated with experimentally determined melting temperatures and with calculated free energies of folding at the midpoint temperature of the simulations. This study provides an approach for in silico mutational screens to improve thermostability of biologically and industrially relevant enzymes.",

        "Abstract": "Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a chaperone protein in the endoplasmic reticulum that is up-regulated in mouse models of, and brains of patients with, neurodegenerative diseases involving protein misfolding. PDI's role in these diseases, however, is not fully understood. Here, we report the discovery of a reversible, neuroprotective lead optimized compound (LOC)14, that acts as a modulator of PDI. LOC14 was identified using a high-throughput screen of \u223c10,000 lead-optimized compounds for potent rescue of viability of PC12 cells expressing mutant huntingtin protein, followed by an evaluation of compounds on PDI reductase activity in an in vitro screen. Isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence experiments revealed that binding to PDI was reversible with a Kd of 62 nM, suggesting LOC14 to be the most potent PDI inhibitor reported to date. Using 2D heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR experiments, we were able to map the binding site of LOC14 as being adjacent to the active site and to observe that binding of LOC14 forces PDI to adopt an oxidized conformation. Furthermore, we found that LOC14-induced oxidation of PDI has a neuroprotective effect not only in cell culture, but also in corticostriatal brain slice cultures. LOC14 exhibited high stability in mouse liver microsomes and blood plasma, low intrinsic microsome clearance, and low plasma-protein binding. These results suggest that LOC14 is a promising lead compound to evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of modulating PDI in animal models of disease.",

        "Title": "Enzyme dynamics from NMR spectroscopy.",
        "Abstract": "CONSPECTUS: Biological activities of enzymes, including regulation or coordination of mechanistic stages preceding or following the chemical step, may depend upon kinetic or equilibrium changes in protein conformations. Exchange of more open or flexible conformational states with more closed or constrained states can influence inhibition, allosteric regulation, substrate recognition, formation of the Michaelis complex, side reactions, and product release. NMR spectroscopy has long been applied to the study of conformational dynamic processes in enzymes because these phenomena can be characterized over multiple time scales with atomic site resolution. Laboratory-frame spin-relaxation measurements, sensitive to reorientational motions on picosecond-nanosecond time scales, and rotating-frame relaxation-dispersion measurements, sensitive to chemical exchange processes on microsecond-millisecond time scales, provide information on both conformational distributions and kinetics. This Account reviews NMR spin relaxation studies of the enzymes ribonuclease HI from mesophilic (Escherichia coli) and thermophilic (Thermus thermophilus) bacteria, E. coli AlkB, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae triosephosphate isomerase to illustrate the contributions of conformational flexibility and dynamics to diverse steps in enzyme mechanism. Spin relaxation measurements and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the bacterial ribonuclease H enzymes show that the handle region, one of three loop regions that interact with substrates, interconverts between two conformations. Comparison of these conformations with the structure of the complex between Homo sapiens ribonuclease H and a DNA:RNA substrate suggests that the more closed state is inhibitory to binding. The large population of the closed conformation in T. thermophilus ribonuclease H contributes to the increased Michaelis constant compared with the E. coli enzyme. NMR spin relaxation and fluorescence spectroscopy have characterized a conformational transition in AlkB between an open state, in which the side chains of methionine residues in the active site are disordered, and a closed state, in which these residues are ordered. The open state is highly populated in the AlkB/Zn(II) complex, and the closed state is highly populated in the AlkB/Zn(II)/2OG/substrate complex, in which 2OG is the 2-oxoglutarate cosubstrate and the substrate is a methylated DNA oligonucleotide. The equilibrium is shifted to approximately equal populations of the two conformations in the AlkB/Zn(II)/2OG complex. The conformational shift induced by 2OG ensures that 2OG binds to AlkB/Zn(II) prior to the substrate. In addition, the opening rate of the closed conformation limits premature release of substrate, preventing generation of toxic side products by reaction with water. Closure of active site loop 6 in triosephosphate isomerase is critical for forming the Michaelis complex, but reopening of the loop after the reaction is (partially) rate limiting. NMR spin relaxation and MD simulations of triosephosphate isomerase in complex with glycerol 3-phosphate demonstrate that closure of loop 6 is a highly correlated rigid-body motion. The MD simulations also indicate that motions of Gly173 in the most flexible region of loop 6 contribute to opening of the active site loop for product release. Considered together, these three enzyme systems illustrate the power of NMR spin relaxation investigations in providing global insights into the role of conformational dynamic processes in the mechanisms of enzymes from initial activation to final product release.",

        "Abstract": "The conformational basis for reduced activity of the thermophilic ribonuclease HI enzyme from Thermus thermophilus, compared to its mesophilic homolog from Escherichia coli, is elucidated using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Explicit-solvent all-atom MD simulations of the two wild-type proteins and an E. coli mutant in which a glycine residue is inserted after position 80 to mimic the T. thermophilus protein reproduce the differences in conformational dynamics determined from (15)N spin-relaxation NMR spectroscopy of three loop regions that surround the active site and contain functionally important residues: the glycine-rich region, the handle region, and the \u03b25/\u03b1E loop. Examination of the MD trajectories indicates that the thermophilic protein samples conformations productive for substrate binding and activity less frequently than the mesophilic enzyme, although these differences may manifest as either increased or decreased relative flexibility of the different regions. Additional MD simulations indicate that mutations increasing activity of the T. thermophilus enzyme at mesophilic temperatures do so by reconfiguring the local environments of the mutated sites to more closely resemble active conformations. Taken together, the results show that both locally increased and decreased flexibility contribute to an overall reduction in activity of T. thermophilus ribonuclease H compared to its mesophilic E. coli homolog.",

        "Abstract": "The propagator for trains of radiofrequency pulses can be directly integrated numerically or approximated by average Hamiltonian approaches. The former provides high accuracy and the latter, in favorable cases, convenient analytical formula. The Euler-angle rotation operator factorization of the propagator provides insights into performance that are not as easily discerned from either of these conventional techniques. This approach is useful in determining whether a shaped pulse can be represented over some bandwidth by a sequence \u03c41-R\u03d5(\u03b2)-\u03c42, in which R\u03d5(\u03b2) is a rotation by an angle \u03b2 around an axis with phase \u03d5 in the transverse plane and \u03c41 and \u03c42 are time delays, allowing phase evolution during the pulse to be compensated by adjusting time periods prior or subsequent to the pulse. Perturbation theory establishes explicit formulas for \u03c41 and \u03c42 as proportional to the average transverse magnetization generated during the shaped pulse. The Euler-angle representation of the propagator also is useful in iterative reduction of pulse-interrupted-free precession schemes. Application to Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequences identifies an eight-pulse phase alternating scheme that generates a propagator nearly equal to the identity operator.",

Here we have employed NMR measurements of backbone-amide (15)N spin-relaxation rates to investigate motions of the ShK backbone. Although ShK is rigid on the ps to ns timescale, increased linewidths observed for 11 backbone-amide (15)N resonances identify chemical or conformational exchange contributions to the spin relaxation. Relaxation dispersion profiles indicate that exchange between major and minor conformers occurs on the sub-millisecond timescale. Affected residues are mostly clustered around the central helix-kink-helix structure and the critical K22-Y23 motif. We suggest that the less structured minor conformer increases the exposure of Y23, known to contribute to binding affinity and selectivity, thereby facilitating its interaction with potassium channels. These findings have potential implications for the design of new channel blockers based on ShK.",

        "Abstract": "A central goal of enzymology is to understand the physicochemical mechanisms that enable proteins to catalyze complex chemical reactions with high efficiency. Recent methodological advances enable the contribution of protein dynamics to enzyme efficiency to be explored more deeply. Here, we utilize enzymological and biophysical studies, including NMR measurements of conformational dynamics, to develop a quantitative mechanistic scheme for the DNA repair enzyme AlkB. Like other iron/2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, AlkB employs a two-step mechanism in which oxidation of 2-oxoglutarate generates a highly reactive enzyme-bound oxyferryl intermediate that, in the case of AlkB, slowly hydroxylates an alkylated nucleobase. Our results demonstrate that a microsecond-to-millisecond time scale conformational transition facilitates the proper sequential order of substrate binding to AlkB. Mutations altering the dynamics of this transition allow generation of the oxyferryl intermediate but promote its premature quenching by solvent, which uncouples 2-oxoglutarate turnover from nucleobase oxidation. Therefore, efficient catalysis by AlkB depends upon the dynamics of a specific conformational transition, establishing another paradigm for the control of enzyme function by protein dynamics.",

        "Abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been employed to study the conformational dynamics of the partially disordered DNA binding basic leucine zipper domain of the yeast transcription factor GCN4. We demonstrate that back-calculated NMR chemical shifts and spin-relaxation data provide complementary probes of the structure and dynamics of disordered protein states and enable comparisons of the accuracy of multiple MD trajectories. In particular, back-calculated chemical shifts provide a sensitive probe of the populations of residual secondary structure elements and helix capping interactions, while spin-relaxation calculations are sensitive to a combination of dynamic and structural factors. Back calculated chemical shift and spin-relaxation data can be used to evaluate the populations of specific interactions in disordered states and identify regions of the phase space that are inconsistent with experimental measurements. The structural interactions that favor and disfavor helical conformations in the disordered basic region of the GCN4 bZip domain were analyzed in order to assess the implications of the structure and dynamics of the apo form for the DNA binding mechanism. The structural couplings observed in these experimentally validated simulations are consistent with a mechanism where the binding of a preformed helical interface would induce folding in the remainder of the protein, supporting a hybrid conformational selection / induced folding binding mechanism.",

In this study, NMR spin relaxation experiments and molecular dynamics simulations are used to measure the dynamics of the side chain amide and carboxyl groups, (13)C(\u03b3/\u03b4), in Escherichia coli ribonuclease HI (RNase H). Model-free analysis shows that the catalytic residues in RNase H are preorganized on ps-ns time scales via a network of electrostatic interactions. However, chemical exchange line broadening shows that these residues display significant conformational dynamics on \u03bcs-ms time scales upon binding of Mg(2+) ions. Two groups of catalytic residues exhibit differential line broadening, implicating distinct reorganizational processes upon binding of metal ions. These results support the \"mobile metal ion\" hypothesis, which was inferred from structural studies of RNase H.",

        "Abstract": "The relationship between inherent internal conformational processes and enzymatic activity or thermodynamic stability of proteins has proven difficult to characterize. The study of homologous proteins with differing thermostabilities offers an especially useful approach for understanding the functional aspects of conformational dynamics. In particular, ribonuclease HI (RNase H), an 18 kD globular protein that hydrolyzes the RNA strand of RNA:DNA hybrid substrates, has been extensively studied by NMR spectroscopy to characterize the differences in dynamics between homologs from the mesophilic organism E. coli and the thermophilic organism T. thermophilus. Herein, molecular dynamics simulations are reported for five homologous RNase H proteins of varying thermostabilities and enzymatic activities from organisms of markedly different preferred growth temperatures. For the E. coli and T. thermophilus proteins, strong agreement is obtained between simulated and experimental values for NMR order parameters and for dynamically averaged chemical shifts, suggesting that these simulations can be a productive platform for predicting the effects of individual amino acid residues on dynamic behavior. Analyses of the simulations reveal that a single residue differentiates between two different and otherwise conserved dynamic processes in a region of the protein known to form part of the substrate-binding interface. Additional key residues within these two categories are identified through the temperature-dependence of these conformational processes.",

        "Abstract": "Epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin), a member of the classical cadherin family, mediates calcium-dependent homophilic cell-cell adhesion. Crystal structures of classical cadherins reveal an adhesive dimer interface featuring reciprocal exchange of N-terminal \u03b2-strands between two protomers. Previous work has identified a putative intermediate (called the \"X-dimer\") in the dimerization pathway of wild-type E-cadherin EC1-EC2 domains, based on crystal structures of mutants not capable of strand swapping and on deceleration of binding kinetics by mutations at the X-dimer interface. In the present work, NMR relaxation dispersion spectroscopy is used to directly observe and characterize intermediate states without the need to disrupt the strand-swapped binding interface by mutagenesis. The results indicate that E-cadherin forms strand-swapped dimers predominantly by a mechanism in which formation of a weak and short-lived X-dimer-like state precedes the conformational changes required for formation of the mature strand-swapped dimeric structure. Disruption of this intermediate state through mutation reduces both association and dissociation rates by factors of ~10(4), while minimally perturbing affinity. The X-dimer interface lowers the energy barrier associated with strand swapping and enables E-cadherins to form strand-swapped dimers at a rate consistent with residence times in adherens junctions.",

        "Title": "Starting-structure dependence of nanosecond timescale intersubstate transitions and reproducibility of MD-derived order parameters.",
        "Abstract": "Factors affecting the accuracy of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are investigated by comparing generalized order parameters for backbone NH vectors of the B3 immunoglobulin-binding domain of streptococcal protein G (GB3) derived from simulations with values obtained from NMR spin relaxation (Yao L, Grishaev A, Cornilescu G, Bax A, J Am Chem Soc 2010;132:4295-4309.). Choices for many parameters of the simulations, such as buffer volume, water model, or salt concentration, have only minor influences on the resulting order parameters. In contrast, seemingly minor conformational differences in starting structures, such as orientations of sidechain hydroxyl groups, resulting from applying different protonation algorithms to the same structure, have major effects on backbone dynamics. Some, but not all, of these effects are mitigated by increased sampling in simulations. Most discrepancies between simulated and experimental results occur for residues located at the ends of secondary structures and involve large amplitude nanosecond timescale transitions between distinct conformational substates. These transitions result in autocorrelation functions for bond vector reorientation that do not converge when calculated over individual simulation blocks, typically of length similar to the overall rotational diffusion time. A test for convergence before averaging the order parameters from different blocks results in better agreement between order parameters calculated from different sets of simulations and with NMR-derived order parameters. Thus, MD-derived order parameters are more strongly affected by transitions between conformational substates than by fluctuations within individual substates themselves, while conformational differences in the starting structures affect the frequency and scale of such transitions.",

        "Abstract": "In this investigation, semiempirical NMR chemical shift prediction methods are used to evaluate the dynamically averaged values of backbone chemical shifts obtained from unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins. MD-averaged chemical shift predictions generally improve agreement with experimental values when compared to predictions made from static X-ray structures. Improved chemical shift predictions result from population-weighted sampling of multiple conformational states and from sampling smaller fluctuations within conformational basins. Improved chemical shift predictions also result from discrete changes to conformations observed in X-ray structures, which may result from crystal contacts, and are not always reflective of conformational dynamics in solution. Chemical shifts are sensitive reporters of fluctuations in backbone and side chain torsional angles, and averaged (1)H chemical shifts are particularly sensitive reporters of fluctuations in aromatic ring positions and geometries of hydrogen bonds. In addition, poor predictions of MD-averaged chemical shifts can identify spurious conformations and motions observed in MD simulations that may result from force field deficiencies or insufficient sampling and can also suggest subsets of conformational space that are more consistent with experimental data. These results suggest that the analysis of dynamically averaged NMR chemical shifts from MD simulations can serve as a powerful approach for characterizing protein motions in atomistic detail.",

        "Abstract": "Activation of many multidomain signaling proteins requires rearrangement of autoinhibitory interdomain interactions that occlude activator binding sites. In one model for activation, the major inactive conformation exists in equilibrium with activated-like conformations that can be stabilized by ligand binding or post-translational modifications. We established the molecular basis for this model for the archetypal signaling adaptor protein Crk-II by measuring the thermodynamics and kinetics of the equilibrium between autoinhibited and activated-like states. We used fluorescence and NMR spectroscopies together with segmental isotopic labeling by means of expressed protein ligation. The results demonstrate that intramolecular domain-domain interactions both stabilize the autoinhibited state and induce the activated-like conformation. A combination of favorable interdomain interactions and unfavorable intradomain structural changes fine-tunes the population of the activated-like conformation and allows facile response to activators. This mechanism suggests a general strategy for optimization of autoinhibitory interactions of multidomain proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Broadening of spectral lines is a signature of chemical exchange phenomena on microsecond to millisecond time scales but has deleterious effects on spectral resolution and sensitivity. A multipulse method based on chemical shift scaling that reduces chemical exchange broadening during frequency-encoding periods of liquid-state multidimensional NMR experiments is described. The proposed scheme utilizes low-power radiofrequency pulses, which offer the advantages of short cycle times and minimal sample heating. The method is suitable for biological macromolecules, as relaxation not resulting from chemical exchange is reduced by placing the magnetization along the z axis for part of the evolution trajectory. The resolution and sensitivity enhancement for resonances broadened by chemical exchange is demonstrated on the protein ribonuclease A. The work demonstrates the feasibility of applying coherent averaging techniques, which were originally developed in solid-state NMR spectroscopy, to biological NMR spectroscopy in the liquid state for resolution enhancement and facilitates the detection of resonances that are severely broadened by chemical exchange processes.",

However, experimental studies for such proteins frequently are hindered because folding rates are too fast to measure using conventional stopped-flow methods. To overcome this impediment, NMR spin relaxation dispersion experiments are used to quantify mutational effects on kinetics (DeltaDeltaG(o)), stability (DeltaDeltaG(o)), and phi-values (DeltaDeltaG(dagger)/DeltaDeltaG(o)) for proteins exhibiting chemical exchange line broadening that is fast on the NMR chemical shift time scale. The accuracy of phi-value analysis is enhanced because mutational effects on denatured or intermediate states can be detected through changes in line broadening. The transition and intermediate states of the villin headpiece domain, HP67, are characterized in varying solvent conditions to validate the method.",

        "Abstract": "Identification and characterization of ensembles of intermediate states remains an important objective in describing protein folding in atomic detail. The 67-residue villin headpiece, HP67, consists of an N-terminal subdomain (residues 10-42) that transiently unfolds at equilibrium under native-like conditions and a highly stable C-terminal subdomain (residues 43-76). The transition between folded and unfolded states of the N-terminal domain has been characterized previously by (15)N NMR relaxation dispersion measurements (Grey et al. in J Mol Biol 355:1078, 2006). In the present work, (13)C spin relaxation was used to further characterize backbone and hydrophobic core contributions to the unfolding process. Relaxation of (13)C(alpha) spins was measured using the Hahn echo technique at five static magnetic fields (11.7, 14.1, 16.4, 18.8, and 21.1 T) and the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion method at a static magnetic field of 14.1 T. Relaxation of methyl (13)C spins was measured using CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments at static magnetic fields of 14.1 and 18.8 T. Results for (13)C and (15)N spins yielded a consistent model in which the partially unfolded intermediate state of the N-terminal subdomain maintains residual structure for residues near the unprotonated His41 imidazole ring and in the interface between the N- and C-terminal subdomains. In addition, a second faster process was detected that appears to represent local dynamics within the folded state of the molecule and is largely confined to the hydrophobic interface between the N- and C-terminal subdomains.",

        "Abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channels initiate the rapid upstroke of action potentials in many excitable tissues. Mutations within intracellular C-terminal sequences of specific channels underlie a diverse set of channelopathies, including cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsy syndromes. The three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal residues 1777-1882 of the human NaV1.2 voltage-gated sodium channel has been determined in solution by NMR spectroscopy at pH 7.4 and 290.5 K. The ordered structure extends from residues Leu-1790 to Glu-1868 and is composed of four alpha-helices separated by two short anti-parallel beta-strands; a less well defined helical region extends from residue Ser-1869 to Arg-1882, and a disordered N-terminal region encompasses residues 1777-1789. Although the structure has the overall architecture of a paired EF-hand domain, the NaV1.2 C-terminal domain does not bind Ca2+ through the canonical EF-hand loops, as evidenced by monitoring 1H,15N chemical shifts during aCa2+ titration. Backbone chemical shift resonance assignments and Ca2+ titration also were performed for the NaV1.5 (1773-1878) isoform, demonstrating similar secondary structure architecture and the absence of Ca2+ binding by the EF-hand loops. Clinically significant mutations identified in the C-terminal region of NaV1 sodium channels cluster in the helix I-IV interface and the helix II-III interhelical segment or in helices III and IV of the NaV1.2 (1777-1882) structure.",

        "Abstract": "Changes in residual conformational entropy of proteins can be significant components of the thermodynamics of folding and binding. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin relaxation is the only experimental technique capable of probing local protein entropy, by inference from local internal conformational dynamics. To assess the validity of this approach, the picosecond-to-nanosecond dynamics of the arginine side-chain N(epsilon)-H(epsilon) bond vectors of Escherichia coli ribonuclease H (RNase H) were determined by NMR spin relaxation and compared to the mechanistic detail provided by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results indicate that arginine N(epsilon) spin relaxation primarily reflects persistence of guanidinium salt bridges and correlates well with simulated side-chain conformational entropy. In particular cases, the simulations show that the aliphatic part of the arginine side chain can retain substantial disorder while the guanidinium group maintains its salt bridges; thus, the N(epsilon)-H(epsilon) bond-vector orientation is conserved and side-chain flexibility is concealed from N(epsilon) spin relaxation. The MD simulations and an analysis of a rotamer library suggest that dynamic decoupling of the terminal moiety from the remainder of the side chain occurs for all five amino acids with more than two side-chain dihedral angles (R, K, E, Q, and M). Dynamic decoupling thus may represent a general biophysical strategy for minimizing the entropic penalties of folding and binding.",

Limited picosecond-to-nanosecond timescale dynamics of the tryptophan indole moieties for both monomer and dimer states are consistent with well-ordered packing of the N-terminal beta strands intramolecularly and intermolecularly, respectively. However, pronounced microsecond-to-millisecond timescale dynamics of the side chains are observed for the monomer but not the dimer state, suggesting that monomers transiently sample configurations in which the indole moieties are exposed. The results suggest possible kinetic mechanisms for EC1 dimerization.",

        "Abstract": "Presynaptic neurexins (NRXs) bind to postsynaptic neuroligins (NLs) to form Ca(2+)-dependent complexes that bridge neural synapses. beta-NRXs bind NLs through their LNS domains, which contain a single site of alternative splicing (splice site 4) giving rise to two isoforms: +4 and Delta. We present crystal structures of the Delta isoforms of the LNS domains from beta-NRX1 and beta-NRX2, crystallized in the presence of Ca(2+) ions. The Ca(2+)-binding site is disordered in the beta-NRX2 structure, but the 1.7 A beta-NRX1 structure reveals a single Ca(2+) ion, approximately 12 A from the splice insertion site, with one coordinating ligand donated by a glutamic acid from an adjacent beta-NRX1 molecule. NMR studies of beta-NRX1+4 show that the insertion sequence is unstructured, and remains at least partially disordered in complex with NL. These results raise the possibility that beta-NRX insertion sequence 4 may function in roles independent of neuroligin binding.",

An analysis of discrepancies between the two methods is presented for the B3 immunoglobulin-binding domain of streptococcal protein G. MD simulations using three MD force fields (OPLS-AA, AMBER ff99SB, and AMBER ff03) overestimate the flexibility of backbone N--H vectors at the borders of secondary structure and in loops when compared with experimentally determined backbone amide generalized order parameters (Hall and Fushman, J Am Chem Soc 2006; 12:7855-7870). Comparison with a previous study of residual dipolar coupling constants (Bouvignies et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2005;102:13885-13890) indicates that slower timescale motions do not account for the discrepancies. Structural analysis reveals that relative imbalance between the description of hydrogen bonding and other terms of modern force fields may be responsible for disagreement.",

        "Abstract": "Fibronectin type III (FN-III) domains are autonomously folded modules found in a variety of multidomain proteins. The 10th FN-III domain from fibronectin (fnFN10) and the 3rd FN-III domain from tenascin-C (tnFN3) have 27% sequence identity and the same overall fold; however, the CC' loop has a different pattern of backbone hydrogen bonds and the FG loop is longer in fnFN10 compared to tnFN3. To examine the influence of length, sequence, and context in determining dynamical properties of loops, CC' and FG loops were swapped between fnFN10 and tnFN3 to generate four mutant proteins and backbone conformational dynamics on ps-ns and mus-ms timescales were characterized by solution (15)N-NMR spin relaxation spectroscopy. The grafted loops do not strongly perturb the properties of the protein scaffold; however, specific effects of the mutations are observed for amino acids that are proximal in space to the sites of mutation. The amino acid sequence primarily dictates conformational dynamics when the wild-type and grafted loop have the same length, but both sequence and context contribute to conformational dynamics when the loop lengths differ. The results suggest that changes in conformational dynamics of mutant proteins must be considered in both theoretical studies and protein design efforts.",

The joint isotope filters have improved broadband filtration performance, even for extreme values of the one-bond (1)H-(13)C scalar coupling constants in proteins and RNA molecules. An average Hamiltonian analysis is used to describe evolution of the heteronuclear scalar coupling interaction during the adiabatic sweeps within the isotope filter sequences. The new isotope filter elements permit improved selective detection of NMR resonance signals originating from (1)H spins attached to an unlabeled natural abundance component of a complex in which the other components are labeled with (13)C and (15)N isotopes.",

        "Abstract": "The study of protein conformational dynamics is motivated in large part by a desire to understand the forces present at different sites throughout the molecular structure. The generalized order parameter determined by NMR spectroscopy has played a central role in the study of protein dynamics on the picosecond-nanosecond time scale. A modeling procedure is presented for analysis of the temperature dependence of the generalized order parameter that extends a previous analysis (Massi and Palmer, J Am Chem Soc 2003;125:11158-11159). As part of this procedure, the potential of mean force is characterized for the N-H bond vectors of the protein backbone. This procedure accounts for the observed temperature dependence of the generalized order parameter in a representative data set from the B1 domain of Streptococcal protein G (Seewald, Pichumani, Stowell, Tibbals, Regan, and Stone, Protein Sci 2000;9:1177-1193). The results indicate a general trend, in which the force constants associated with the potential of mean force decrease with increasing temperature. The analysis also provides evidence for variations in the potential of mean force for different secondary structural elements.",

        "Abstract": "Dynamic processes are inherent properties of proteins and are crucial for a wide range of biological functions. To address how changes in protein sequence and structure affect dynamic processes, a quantitative comparison of microsecond-to-microsecond time scale conformational changes, measured by solution NMR spectroscopy, within homologous mesophilic and thermophilic ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes is presented. Kinetic transitions between the observed major state (high population) and alternate (low population) conformational state(s) of the substrate-binding handle region in RNase H from the mesophile Escherichia coli (ecRNH) and thermophile Thermus thermophilus (ttRNH) occur with similar kinetic exchange rate constants, but the difference in stability between exchanging conformers is smaller in ttRNH compared to ecRNH. The altered thermodynamic equilibrium between kinetically exchanging conformers in the thermophile is recapitulated in ecRNH by the insertion of a Gly residue within a putative hinge between alpha-helices B and C. This Gly insertion is conserved among thermophilic RNases H, and allows the formation of additional intrahelical hydrogen bonds. A Gly residue inserted between alpha-helices B and C appears to relieve unfavorable interactions in the transition state and alternate conformer(s) and represents an important adaptation to adjust conformational changes within RNase H for activity at high temperatures.",

        "Abstract": "Solution NMR spin relaxation experiments and classical MD simulations are used to study the dynamics of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) in complex with glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P). Three regions in TIM exhibit conformational transitions on the micros-ms time scale as detected by chemical exchange broadening effects in NMR spectroscopy: residue Lys 84 on helix C, located at the dimeric interface; active site loop 6; and helix G. The results indicate that the conformational exchange process affecting the residues of loop 6 is the correlated opening and closing of the loop. Distinct processes are responsible for the chemical exchange linebroadening observed in the other regions of TIM. MD simulations confirm that motions of individual residues within the active site loop are correlated and suggest that the chemical exchange processes observed for residues in helix G arise from transitions between 3(10)- and alpha-helical structures. The results of the joint NMR and MD study provide global insight into the role of conformational dynamic processes in the function of TIM.",

A TROSY-selected (TS) approach for measuring off-resonance R1rho relaxation in the spin-locked rotating reference frame is developed using three principles: (i) deuteration of nonexchangeable 1H sites to minimize remote dipole-dipole interactions, (ii) selective excitation of the slowly relaxing 15N doublet component to obtain optimal initial conditions, and (iii) selective inversion of one of the 15N doublet components to suppress cross-relaxation during the spin-lock period. The method is validated using [90%-15N, 70%-2H] ubiquitin at 280 K. The TROSY-selected R1rho experiment enables characterization of backbone dynamics on the microsecond time scale in large proteins.",

The Vts1 SAM domain retains the \"core\" five-helix-bundle architecture of traditional SAM domains, but has additional short helices at N and C termini, comprising a small substructure that caps the core helices. The RNA-binding surface of Vts1, determined by chemical shift perturbation, maps near the ends of three of the core helices, in agreement with mutational data and the electrostatic properties of the molecule.

        "Title": "Multistate folding of the villin headpiece domain.",
        "Abstract": "The villin headpiece (HP67) is a 67 residue, monomeric protein derived from the C-terminal domain of villin. Wild-type HP67 (WT HP67) is the smallest fragment of villin that retains strong in vitro actin-binding activity. WT HP67 is made up of two subdomains, which form a tightly packed interface. The C-terminal subdomain of WT HP67, denoted HP35, is rich in helical structure, folds in isolation, and has been widely used as a model system for folding studies. In contrast, very little is known about the folding of the intact villin headpiece domain. Here, NMR, CD and H/2H amide exchange measurements are used to follow the pH, thermal and urea-induced unfolding of WT HP67 and a mutant (HP67 H41Y) in which a buried conserved histidine in the N-terminal subdomain, His41, has been mutated to Tyr. Although most small proteins display two-state equilibrium unfolding, the results presented here demonstrate that unfolding of the villin headpiece is a multistate process. The presence of a folded N-terminal subdomain is shown to stabilize the C-terminal subdomain, increasing the midpoints of the thermal and urea-induced unfolding transitions and increasing protection factors for H/2H exchange. Histidine 41 has been shown to act as a pH-dependent switch in wild-type HP67: the N-terminal subdomain is unfolded when His41 is protonated, while the C-terminal subdomain remains folded irrespective of the protonation state of His41. Mutation of His41 to Tyr eliminates the segmental pH-dependent unfolding of the headpiece. The mutation stabilizes both domains, but folding is still multistate, indicating that His41 is not solely responsible for the unusual equilibrium unfolding behavior of villin headpiece domain.",

        "Abstract": "The contribution of interactions involving the imidazole ring of His41 to the pH-dependent stability of the villin headpiece (HP67) N-terminal subdomain has been investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin relaxation. NMR-derived backbone N-H order parameters (S2) for wild-type (WT) HP67 and H41Y HP67 indicate that reduced conformational flexibility of the N-terminal subdomain in WT HP67 is due to intramolecular interactions with the His41 imidazole ring. These interactions, together with desolvation effects, contribute to significantly depress the pKa of the buried imidazole ring in the native state. 15N R1rho relaxation dispersion data indicate that WT HP67 populates a partially folded intermediate state that is 10.9 kJ mol(-1) higher in free energy than the native state under non-denaturing conditions at neutral pH. The partially folded intermediate is characterized as having an unfolded N-terminal subdomain while the C-terminal subdomain retains a native-like fold. Although the majority of the residues in the N-terminal subdomain sample a random-coil distribution of conformations, deviations of backbone amide 1H and 15N chemical shifts from canonical random-coil values for residues within 5A of the His41 imidazole ring indicate that a significant degree of residual structure is maintained in the partially folded ensemble. The pH-dependence of exchange broadening is consistent with a linear three-state exchange model whereby unfolding of the N-terminal subdomain is coupled to titration of His41 in the partially folded intermediate with a pKa,I=5.69+/-0.07. Although maintenance of residual interactions with the imidazole ring in the unfolded N-terminal subdomain appears to reduce pKa,I compared to model histidine compounds, protonation of His41 disrupts these interactions and reduces the difference in free energy between the native state and partially folded intermediate under acidic conditions. In addition, chemical shift changes for residues Lys70-Phe76 in the C-terminal subdomain suggest that the HP67 actin binding site is disrupted upon unfolding of the N-terminal subdomain, providing a potential mechanism for regulating the villin-dependent bundling of actin filaments.",

        "Abstract": "The helical subdomain, HP36, of the F-actin-binding headpiece domain of chicken villin, is the smallest naturally occurring polypeptide that folds to a thermostable compact structure. Unconstrained molecular dynamics simulations and constrained molecular dynamics simulations using umbrella sampling are used to study the temperature dependence of internal motions of the backbone amide moieties of HP36. The potential of mean force (PMF) for the N-H bond vector, determined from the constrained simulations, is found to be temperature dependent. A simple analytical expression is derived that describes the temperature dependence of the PMF. The parameters of this model are obtained from the PMF, from the unconstrained molecular dynamics simulations, or from experimental values of the generalized order parameter. The results provide a linkage between experimental and theoretical measures of the temperature dependence of protein motions.",

        "Abstract": "Analytic expressions for the nuclear magnetic spin relaxation rate constant for magnetization spin-locked in the rotating reference frame under an applied radiofrequency field, R(1rho), are obtained for two-site chemical exchange. The theoretical approach is motivated by Laguerre's method and obtains R(1rho) as the root of a (p1,q1) Pad\u00e9 approximant. The general formula for R(1rho) obtained by this approach is substantially simpler than existing expressions and is equally or slightly more accurate, in most cases. In addition, particular solutions for the R(1rho) rate constant are presented for two special cases: equal populations of the two exchanging sites, or placement of the radiofrequency carrier at the average resonance frequency of the two sites. The solutions are exact when the R1 and R2 relaxation rate constants are identical, and nearly exact under realistic experimental conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Chemical shift changes and internal motions on microsecond-to-millisecond time scales of the S1S2 ligand-binding domain of the GluR2 ionotropic glutamate receptor have been studied by NMR spectroscopy in the presence of the agonists glutamic acid (glutamate), quisqualic acid (quisqualate), and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA). Although the crystal structures of the three agonist-bound forms of GluR2 S1S2 ligand-binding domain are very similar, chemical shift changes imply that AMPA-bound GluR2 S1S2 is conformationally distinct from glutamate- and quisqualate-bound forms of GluR2 S1S2. NMR spin relaxation measurements for backbone amide (15)N nuclei reveal that GluR2 S1S2 exhibits reduced chemical exchange line broadening, resulting from microsecond-to-millisecond conformational dynamics, in AMPA-bound compared to glutamate- and quisqualate-bound states. The largest changes in line broadening are observed for two regions of GluR2 S1S2: Val683 and the segment around Lys716-Cys718. The differences in binding affinity of these agonists do not explain the differences in microsecond-to-millisecond conformational dynamics because quisqualate and AMPA bind with similar affinities that are 10-fold greater than the affinity of glutamate. Differences in conformational mobility may reflect differences in the binding mode of AMPA in the GluR2 S1S2 active site compared to the other two ligands. The sites of conformational mobility in GluR2 S1S2 imply that subtle differences exist between the agonists glutamate, quisqualate, and AMPA in modulating glutamate receptor function.",

Chemical exchange processes affecting residues Ile 23, Asn 25, Thr 55, and Val 70 are characterized using on- and off-resonance rotating-frame 15N R1rho relaxation experiments to have a kinetic exchange rate constant of 25,000 sec(-1) at 280 K. The exchange process affecting residues 23, 25, and 55 appears to result from disruption of N-cap hydrogen bonds of the alpha-helix and possibly from repacking of the side chain of Ile 23. Chemical exchange processes affecting other residues on the surface of ubiquitin are identified using 1H-15N multiple quantum relaxation experiments. These residues are located near or at the regions known to interact with various enzymes of the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Backbone conformational fluctuations on multiple time scales in a cysteine-free Thermus thermophilus ribonuclease HI mutant (ttRNH(*)) are quantified using (15)N nuclear magnetic spin relaxation. Laboratory-frame relaxation data acquired at 310 K and at static magnetic field strengths of 11.7, 14.1 and 18.8 T are analysed using reduced spectral density mapping and model-free approaches. Chemical exchange line broadening is characterized using Hahn-echo transverse and multiple quantum relaxation data acquired over a temperature range of 290-320 K and at a static magnetic field strength of 14.1 T. Results for ttRNH(*) are compared to previously published data for a mesophilic homologue, Escherichia coli ribonuclease HI (ecRNH). Intramolecular conformational fluctuations on the picosecond-to-nanosecond time scale generally are similar for ttRNH(*) and ecRNH. beta-Strands 3 and 5 and the glycine-rich region are more rigid while the substrate-binding handle region and C-terminal tail are more flexible in ttRNH(*) than in ecRNH. Rigidity in the two beta-strands and the glycine-rich region, located along the periphery of the central beta-sheet, may be associated with the increased thermodynamic stability of the thermophilic enzyme. Chemical exchange line broadening, reflecting microsecond-to-millisecond time scale conformational changes, is more pronounced in ttRNH(*) than in ecRNH, particularly for residues in the handle and surrounding the catalytic site. The temperature dependence of chemical exchange show an increase of approximately 15 kJ/mol in the apparent activation energies for ttRNH(*) residues in the handle compared to ecRNH. Increased activation barriers, coupled with motion between alpha-helices B and C not present in ecRNH, may be associated with the reduced catalytic activity of the thermophilic enzyme at 310 K.",

        "Title": "NMR R1 rho rotating-frame relaxation with weak radio frequency fields.",
        "Abstract": "NMR spin relaxation in the rotating frame (R(1 rho)) is one of few methods available to characterize chemical exchange kinetic processes occurring on micros-ms time scales. R(1 rho) measurements for heteronuclei in biological macromolecules generally require decoupling of (1)H scalar coupling interactions and suppression of cross-relaxation processes. Korzhnev and co-workers demonstrated that applying conventional (1)H decoupling schemes while the heteronuclei are spin-locked by a radio frequency (rf) field results in imperfect decoupling [Korzhnev, Skrynnikov, Millet, Torchia, Kay. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 10743-10753]. Experimental NMR pulse sequences were presented that provide accurate measurements of R(1 rho) rate constants for radio frequency field strengths > 1000 Hz. This paper presents new two-dimensional NMR experiments that allow the use of weak rf fields, between 150 and 1000 Hz, in R(1 rho) experiments. Fourier decomposition and average Hamiltonian theory are employed to analyze the spin-lock sequence and provide a guide for the development of improved experiments. The new pulse sequences are validated using ubiquitin and basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). The use of weak spin-lock fields in R(1 rho) experiments allows the study of the chemical exchange process on a wider range of time scales, bridging the gap that currently exists between Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill and conventional R(1 rho) experiments. The new experiments also extend the capability of the R(1 rho) technique to study exchange processes outside the fast exchange limit.",

        "Abstract": "Conformational changes occurring on the microsecond-millisecond time scale in basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) are investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The rczz CPMG experiment (Wang, C.; Grey, M. J.; Palmer, A. G. J. Biomol. NMR 2001, 21, 361-366) is used to record (15)N spin relaxation dispersion data, R(ex)(1/tau(cp)), in which 1/tau(cp) is the pulsing rate in the CPMG sequence, at two static magnetic fields, 11.7 and 14.1 T, and three temperatures, 280, 290, and 300 K. These data are used to characterize the kinetics and mechanism of chemical exchange line broadening of the backbone (15)N spins of Cys 14, Lys 15, Cys 38, and Arg 39 in BPTI. Line broadening is found to result from two processes: the previously identified isomerization of the Cys 38 side chain between chi(1) rotamers (Otting, G.; Liepinsh, E.; W\u00fcthrich, K. Biochemistry 1993, 32, 3571-3582) and a previously uncharacterized process on a faster time scale. At 300 K, both processes contribute significantly to the relaxation dispersion for Cys 14 and an analytical expression for a linear three-site exchange model is used to analyze the data. At 280 K, isomerization of the Cys 38 side chain is negligibly slow and the faster process dominates the relaxation dispersion for all four spins. Global analysis of the temperature and static field dependence of R(ex)(1/tau(cp)) for Cys 14 and Lys 15 is used to determine the activation parameters and chemical shift changes for the previously uncharacterized chemical exchange process. Through an analysis of a database of chemical shifts, (15)N chemical shift changes for Cys 14 and Lys 15 are interpreted to result from a chi(1) rotamer transition of Cys 14 that converts the Cys 14-Cys 38 disulfide bond between right- and left-handed conformations. At 290 K, isomerization of Cys 14 occurs with a forward and reverse rate constant of 35 s(-1) and 2500 s(-1), respectively, a time scale more than 30-fold faster than the Cys 38 chi(1) isomerization. A comparison of the kinetics and thermodynamics for the transitions between the two alternative Cys 14-Cys 38 conformations highlights the factors that affect the contribution of disulfide bonds to protein stability.",

        "Abstract": "The Nun protein of lambdoid phage HK022 excludes lambda-phage superinfection by blocking expression of genes downstream from the lambda nut sequences. Heteronuclear NMR studies have been performed on a Nun peptide comprising residues 1-49 bound to the nutR BoxB RNA. The pattern of (13)C chemical shifts indicates that the arginine-rich motif of Nun forms an induced alpha-helix, consisting of residues 23-43, when bound to BoxB RNA, consistent with the structure of a shorter (residues 22-44) Nun peptide/BoxB RNA complex [Faber, C., Sch\u00e4rpf, M., Becker, T., Sticht, H. and R\u00f6sch (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 32064-32070]. The N-terminal extension, residues 1-22, does not show chemical shifts or nuclear Overhauser effects characteristic of stable secondary structure. Nonetheless, (15)N relaxation measurements indicate that this region is not completely disordered, as expected for a random coil peptide. Restriction of conformation flexibility in the N-terminal extension of Nun may be important for binding to other target molecules involved in transcription termination.",

        "Abstract": "The model free (MF) approach allows straightforward extraction of generalized order parameters and correlation times for internal and overall bond vector reorientational fluctuations from NMR spin relaxation measurements for macromolecules in solution. The drawback of this approach is the use of a decoupling approximation that neglects correlations between internal and overall molecular motions. These correlations are significant when fluctuation amplitudes are less than the size of the \"cage\" that restricts the bond vector. In this regime, motion of the bond vector is only indirectly affected by molecule fluctuations through the orienting potential for the local director axis. By separating the regimes of large and small amplitude molecular fluctuations, an expression for the spectral density function is derived that does not invoke the decoupling approximation, but that relies on the same macroscopic level of description as the original MF approach. The parameters of the spectral density function provide insight into the effects on the MF parameters that result from violation of the decoupling approximation.",

        "Title": "Temperature-dependent dynamics of the villin headpiece helical subdomain, an unusually small thermostable protein.",
        "Abstract": "(15)N spin relaxation experiments were used to measure the temperature-dependence of protein backbone conformational fluctuations in the thermostable helical subdomain, HP36, of the F-actin-binding headpiece domain of chicken villin. HP36 is the smallest domain of a naturally occurring protein that folds cooperatively to a compact native state. Spin-lattice, spin-spin, and heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effect relaxation data for backbone amide (15)N spins were collected at five temperatures in the range of 275-305 K. The data were analyzed using a model-free formalism to determine generalized order parameters, S, that describe the distribution of N-H bond vector orientations in a molecular reference frame. A novel parameter, Lambda=dln(1-S)/dln T is introduced to characterize the temperature-dependence of S. An average value of Lambda=4.5 is obtained for residues in helical conformations in HP36. This value of Lambda is not reproduced by model potential energy functions commonly used to parameterize S. The maximum entropy principle was used to derive a new model potential function that reproduces both S and Lambda. Contributions to the entropy, S(r), and heat capacity, C(r)(p), from reorientational conformational fluctuations were analyzed using this potential energy function. Values of S(r) show a qualitative dependence on S similar to that obtained for the diffusion-in-a-cone model; however, quantitative differences of up to 0.5k, in which k is the Boltzmann constant, are observed. Values of C(r)(p) approach zero for small values of S and approach k for large values of S; the largest values of C(r)(p) are predicted to occur for intermediate values of S. The results suggest that backbone dynamics, as probed by relaxation measurements, make very little contribution to the heat capacity difference between folded and unfolded states for HP36.",

The results are accurate provided that the spin relaxation decay is dominated by a single exponential damping constant and are applicable to a wider range of conditions than existing theoretical descriptions.
