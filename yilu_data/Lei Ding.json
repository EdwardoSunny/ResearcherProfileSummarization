        "Title": "Decoding sunitinib resistance in ccRCC: Metabolic-reprogramming-induced ABAT and GABAergic system shifts.",
        "Abstract": "Sunitinib, a primary treatment for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), frequently encounters the challenge of resistance development. Metabolic reprogramming, a characteristic change in ccRCC, is likely linked to this resistance. Our research revealed a notable decrease in the expression of the key metabolic gene ABAT in ccRCC, which contributed to diminished sensitivity to sunitinib. Downregulation of ABAT led to an increase in the intracellular level of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), triggering abnormal activation of the G-protein-coupled receptor GABA-B. This activation resulted in increased transactivation of the tyrosine kinase receptors SYK and LYN, thereby reducing the antitumor and antiangiogenic properties of sunitinib. However, the application of SYK and LYN inhibitors successfully inhibited this effect. The transactivation of SYK and LYN caused resistance to the antiangiogenic effects of sunitinib through the upregulation of PGF protein levels. Furthermore, the combined application of an LYN inhibitor with sunitinib has been shown to enhance therapeutic efficacy.",

        "Abstract": "Wetting behaviors can significantly affect the transport of energy and signal (E&S) through vapor, solid, and liquid interfaces, which has prompted increased interest in interfacial science and technology. E&S transmission can be achieved using electricity, light, and heat, which often accompany and interact with each other. Over the past decade, their distinctive transport phenomena during wetting processes have made significant contributions to various domains. However, few studies have analyzed the intricate relationship between wetting behavior and E&S transport. This review summarizes and discusses the mechanisms of electrical, light, and heat transmission at wetting interfaces to elucidate their respective scientific issues, technical characteristics, challenges, commonalities, and potential for technological convergence. The materials, structures, and devices involved in E&S transportation are also analyzed. Particularly, harnessing synergistic advantages in practical applications and constructing advanced, multifunctional, and highly efficient smart systems based on wetted interfaces is the aim to provide strategies.",

        "Abstract": "Epidemiological evidence indicates an association between exposure to toxic metals and the occurrence of cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs). However, the impact of exposure to harmful metallic elements, such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg), on mortality in individuals with cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM) remains uncertain. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed data from 4139 adults diagnosed with CMM from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2016. CMM was defined as the presence of at least two CMDs (hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and coronary artery disease). Over an average follow-up period of 9.0 years, 1379 deaths from all causes, 515 deaths related to cardiovascular disease (CVD), and 215 deaths attributable to cancer were recorded. After adjusting for potential covariates, serum Pb concentrations were not associated with all-cause, CVD, or cancer mortality. Participants exposed to Cd had an elevated risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.23; 95\u202f% CI, 1.16-1.30), CVD-related mortality (HR, 1.23; 95\u202f% CI, 1.12-1.35), and cancer-related mortality (HR, 1.29; 95\u202f% CI, 1.13-1.47). Participants with serum Hg levels in the highest quantile had lower risks of all-cause (HR, 0.64; 95\u202f% CI, 0.52-0.80) and CVD-related (HR, 0.62; 95\u202f% CI, 0.44-0.88) mortality than did those in the lowest quantile. Stratified analyses revealed significant interactions between serum Cd concentrations and age for CVD-related mortality (P for interaction =0.011), indicating that CMM participants aged < 60 years who were exposed to Cd were at a greater risk of CVD-related mortality. A nonlinear relationship was observed between serum Cd concentrations and all-cause (P for nonlinear relationship = 0.012) and CVD-related (P for nonlinear relationship < 0.001) mortality. Minimizing Cd exposure in patients with CMM may help prevent premature death.",

        "Abstract": "Lensless imagers based on diffusers or encoding masks enable high-dimensional imaging from a single-shot measurement and have been applied in various applications. However, to further extract image information such as edge detection, conventional post-processing filtering operations are needed after the reconstruction of the original object images in the diffuser imaging systems. Here, we present the concept of a temporal compressive edge detection method based on a lensless diffuser camera, which can directly recover a time sequence of edge images of a moving object from a single-shot measurement, without further post-processing steps. Our approach provides higher image quality during edge detection, compared with the \"conventional post-processing method.\" We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by both numerical simulation and experiments. The proof-of-concept approach can be further developed with other image post-processing operations or versatile computer vision assignments toward task-oriented intelligent lensless imaging systems.",

        "Abstract": "Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) play a crucial role in the continuous self-renewal and recovery of the intestinal epithelium. In previous studies, we have revealed that the specific absence of Claudin-7 (Cldn-7) in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) can lead to the development of spontaneous colitis. However, the mechanisms by which Cldn-7 maintains homeostasis in the colonic epithelium remain unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we used IEC- and ISC-specific Cldn-7 knockout mice to investigate the regulatory effects of Cldn-7 on colonic Lgr5",

        "Abstract": "Widely used organophosphorus pesticide triazophos (TAP) can easily cumulate in aquatic system due to its high stability chemically and photochemically and thus posing significant threat to aquatic creatures and humans' health. Urging demand for rapid determining\u00a0TAP in water has risen. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing turns out to be a good candidate for its simplicity in fabrication and swiftness in detection. Nevertheless, traditional PEC sensors often lack selectivity as their signal generation primarily relies on the oxidation of organic compounds in the electrolyte by photo-induced holes. To address this limitation, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) can be in combined with PEC sensors to significantly enhance the selectivity. Here, we present a novel approach utilizing a PEC sensor enhanced by carbon-modified titanium dioxide molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP/C/TiO",

        "Abstract": "InGaAs detection systems have been increasingly used in the aerospace field, and due to the high signal-to-noise ratio requirements of short-wave infrared quantitative payloads, there is an urgent need for methods for the rapid and precise evaluation and the optimal design of these systems. The rigid-flex printed circuit board (PCB) is a vital component of InGaAs detectors, as its grid ground plane design parameters impact parasitic capacitance and thus affect weak infrared analog signals. To address the time-intensive and costly nature of design optimization achieved with simulations and experimental measurements, we propose an innovative method based on a neural network to predict the scattering parameters of rigid-flex boards for InGaAs detection links. This is the first study in which the effects of rigid-flex boards on weak infrared detection signals have been considered. We first obtained sufficient samples with software simulation. A backpropagation (BP) neural network prediction model was trained on existing sample sets and then verified on a rigid-flex board used in a crucial aerospace short-wave infrared quantitative mission. The model efficiently and accurately predicted high-speed interconnect scattering parameters under various rigid-flex board grid plane parameter conditions. The prediction error was less than 1% compared with a 3D field solver, indicating an overcoming of the iterative optimization inefficiency and showing improved design quality for InGaAs detection circuits.",

        "Abstract": "Solid-state quantum emitters are vital building blocks for quantum information science and quantum technology. Among various types of solid-state emitters discovered to date, color centers in hexagonal boron nitride have garnered tremendous traction in recent years, thanks to their environmental robustness, high brightness, and room-temperature operation. Most recently, these quantum emitters have been employed for satellite-based quantum key distribution. One of the most important requirements to qualify these emitters for space-based applications is their optical stability against cryogenic thermal shock. Such an understanding has, however, remained elusive to date. Here, we report on the effects caused by such thermal shock that induces random, irreversible changes in the spectral characteristics of the quantum emitters. By employing a combination of structural characterizations and density functional calculations, we attribute the observed changes to lattice strain caused by cryogenic temperature shock. Our study sheds light on the stability of the quantum emitters under extreme conditions\u2500similar to those countered in outer space.",

        "Title": "Comprehensive kinetic modeling and product distribution for pyrolysis of pulp and paper mill sludge.",
        "Abstract": "Pyrolysis holds immense potential for clean treatment of pulp and paper mill sludge (PPMS), enabling efficient energy and chemical recovery. However, current understanding of PPMS pyrolysis kinetics and product characteristics remains incomplete. This study conducted detailed modeling of pyrolysis kinetics for two typical PPMSs from a wastepaper pulp and paper mill, namely, deinking sludge (PPMS-DS) and sewage sludge (PPMS-SS), and analyzed comprehensively pyrolysis products. The results show that apparent activation energy of PPMS-DS (169.25-226.82\u00a0kJ/mol) and PPMS-SS (189.29-411.21\u00a0kJ/mol) pyrolysis undergoes significant change, with numerous parallel reactions present. A distributed activation energy model with dual logistic distributions proves to be suitable for modeling thermal decomposition kinetics of both PPMS-DS and PPMS-SS, with coefficient of determination >0.999 and relative root mean square error <1.99\u00a0%. High temperature promotes decomposition of solid organic materials in PPMS, and maximum tar yield for both PPMS-DS (53.90\u00a0wt%, daf) and PPMS-SS (56.48\u00a0wt%, daf) is achieved at around 500\u00a0\u00b0C. Higher levels of styrene (24.45\u00a0% for PPMS-DS and 14.71\u00a0% for PPMS-SS) and ethylbenzene (8.61\u00a0% for PPMS-DS and 8.33\u00a0% for PPMS-SS) are detected in tar and could be used as chemicals. This work shows great potential to propel development of PPMS pyrolysis technology, enabling green and sustainable production in pulp and paper industry.",

        "Abstract": "Human resting-state networks (RSNs) estimated from oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR) data exhibit strong similarities, while task-based studies show different dynamics in HbR and HbO responses. Such a discrepancy might be explained due to time-averaged estimations of RSNs. Our study investigated differences between HbO and HbR on time-resolved brain-wide coactivation patterns (CAPs).",

        "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are known to be linked with dyslipidemia. Between March and June 2022, we collected 575 fasting serum samples from individuals without occupational exposure in Jinan, China. Eighteen PFASs were analyzed using UHPLC-Orbitrap MS. Multiple linear regression (MLR), Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), and Quantile g-computation (QGC) models were utilized to assess the effects of both individual PFAS and PFAS mixtures on serum lipid levels, including triglycerides (TG), cholesterol (CHO), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). The PFAS mixture, composed of perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA), perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA), perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluoroheptane sulfonic acid (PFHpS), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA), showed a positive association with CHO and LDL levels, while no distinct trend was noted in HDL and TG levels about changes in PFAS mixtures levels in BKMR and QGC models, adjusted for gender, age, BMI, occupation, and educational level. The effects of individual PFASs on lipid levels were in general consistent across MLR, BKMR and QGC models. PFUnDA and PFTrDA demonstrated greater impacts on blood lipid levels compared to other PFAS, albeit with varied directional effects. Age-stratified analysis revealed PFAS mixture effect was more pronounced in participants aged higher than 40. No obvious trend in lipid levels with changes in PFAS mixture levels in participants with age ranged from 18 to 40, while positive association between PFAS mixture and CHO and LDL was detected in participants aged higher than 40.",

In recent years, the paramedian approach technique (PAT) has gained increasing interest due to its advantages over the conventional midline approach technique (MAT) that has been traditionally employed in clinical practice for LP. However, there have been inconsistent discussions regarding the efficacy of different LP techniques. Based on digital virtual human and computer simulation techniques, a new approach called computerised modified PAT (CMPAT) was proposed. Therefore, the aim of this study is to discuss a randomised controlled trial (RCT) protocol to investigate and compare the effects of CMPAT and MAT in patients undergoing LP.",

        "Title": "IgG is an aging factor that drives adipose tissue fibrosis and metabolic decline.",
        "Abstract": "Aging is underpinned by pronounced metabolic decline; however, the drivers remain obscure. Here, we report that IgG accumulates during aging, particularly in white adipose tissue (WAT), to impair adipose tissue function and metabolic health. Caloric restriction (CR) decreases IgG accumulation in WAT, whereas replenishing IgG counteracts CR's metabolic benefits. IgG activates macrophages via Ras signaling and consequently induces fibrosis in WAT through the TGF-\u03b2/SMAD pathway. Consistently, B cell null mice are protected from aging-associated WAT fibrosis, inflammation, and insulin resistance, unless exposed to IgG. Conditional ablation of the IgG recycling receptor, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), in macrophages prevents IgG accumulation in aging, resulting in prolonged healthspan and lifespan. Further, targeting FcRn by antisense oligonucleotide restores WAT integrity and metabolic health in aged mice. These findings pinpoint IgG as a hidden culprit in aging and enlighten a novel strategy to rejuvenate metabolic health.",

        "Abstract": "The synthesis of iron-based nanoparticles (Fe NPs) using traditional preparation methods suffered from the disadvantages of high cost, environmental harm, and easy agglomeration. In this study, a novel eco-friendly method was proposed for the synthesis of iron nanomaterials (ML-Fe NPs): using antioxidant components extracted from mulberry leaf to reduce divalent iron (II). The preparation conditions of ML-Fe NPs were optimized by orthogonal tests. The prepared ML-Fe NPs exhibited an amorphous core-shell structure, displaying excellent dispersion and stability. During the synthesis process of ML-Fe NPs, the polyphenol molecules in mulberry leaf extract played a dominant role. A possible synthetic mechanism involving complexation, reduction, and encapsulation was proposed. Furthermore, the ML-Fe NPs were utilized to construct an ML-Fe NPs/peroxymonosulfate catalytic system for the degradation of Rhodamine B dye wastewater. The ML-Fe NPs demonstrated remarkable catalytic potential, achieving a 99% degradation efficiency for Rhodamine B within a span of 40\u00a0min.",

Herein, the wasted A4 papers are efficiently converted into an advanced carbon material owning a hierarchical porous structure with a high surface area and interconnected multiscale channels, a graphitic structure, and a good level of N/O codoping. By taking advantage of these features, an express electron/ion transfer pathway, a large accessible surface interface, and a robust architecture are achieved for swift kinetics, numerous active sites, and excellent steadiness to afford a charming Zn",

        "Abstract": "Epidemiological evidence suggests associations between exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), while diabetes is a common risk factor for CVD. The present study aims to clarify the effect of high PAH exposure on diabetes and stroke in general population. A total of 7849 individuals aged 20\u00a0years or older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2016 were included in the study. The logistic regression analysis modeled the association between PAH exposure and diabetes as well as stroke. The analysis yielded odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The study also evaluated the potential mediating role of diabetes in the relation between PAH exposure and stroke via mediating effect analyses. Of the 7849 eligible participants, 1424 cases of diabetes and 243 cases of stroke were recorded. After adjusting for covariates including age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, education level, marital status, physical activity, hypertension, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and BMI, the ORs for stroke in the highest quartile (Q4) of total urinary PAHs were 1.97 (95% CI 1.11-3.52, P\u2009=\u20090.022) as compared to the lowest quartile (Q1) of total urinary PAHs. The ORs for diabetes in the Q4 of total urinary PAHs were 1.56 (95% CI 1.15-2.12, P\u2009=\u20090.005), while the ORs between Q4 and Q1 for stroke and diabetes concerning exposure to 2-hydroxynaphthalene were 2.23 (95% CI 1.17-4.25, P\u2009=\u20090.016) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.07-1.82, P\u2009=\u20090.015), respectively. The mediation analysis found that diabetes accounted for 5.00% of the associations between urinary PAHs and the prevalence of stroke. Urinary metabolites of PAH have been linked to stroke and diabetes. Increasing the risk of diabetes may play a significant role in mediating the association between exposure to PAHs and increased risk of stroke. Monitoring and improving glucose metabolism in individuals with high exposure to PAHs may aid in reducing the prevalence of stroke.",

        "Title": "Association between phthalate metabolite mixture in neonatal cord serum and birth outcomes.",
        "Abstract": "Prenatal exposure to phthalates (PAEs) is ubiquitous among Chinese neonates. PAEs entering the body will be transformed to various hydrolyzed and oxidated PAE metabolites (mPAEs). PAEs and mPAEs exposure may lead to adverse birth outcomes through disruption of multiple hormone signaling pathways, induction of oxidative stress, and alterations in intracellular signaling processes. In this study, the concentrations of 11 mPAEs in 318 umbilical cord serum samples from neonates in Jinan were quantified with HPLC-ESI-MS. Multiple linear regression, Bayesian kernel machine regression, and quantile g-computation models were utilized to investigate the effects of both individual mPAE and mPAE mixture on birth outcomes. Stratified analysis was performed to explore whether these effects were gender-specific. mPAE mixture was negatively associated with birth length (BL) z-score, birth weight (BW) z-score, head circumference (HC) z-score, and ponderal index (PI). Mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) manifested negative associations with BL(z-score), BW(z-score), HC(z-score), and PI, whereas mono(2-carboxymethylhexyl) phthalate (MCMHP) was negatively associated with BW(z-score) and PI within the mPAE mixture. Stratified analysis revealed that the negative associations between mPAE mixture and four birth outcomes were attenuated in female infants, while the positive impact of mono(2-ethyl-5carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP) on BL(z-score) and BW(z-score) could be detected only in females. In summary, our findings suggest that prenatal exposure to phthalates may be associated with intrauterine growth restriction, and these effects vary according to the gender of the infant.",

        "Abstract": "Anomaly detection is a highly important task in the field of data analysis. Traditional anomaly detection approaches often strongly depend on data size, structure and features, while introducing the idea of ensemble into anomaly detection can greatly improve the generalization ability. Ensemble-based anomaly detection methods still face some challenges, however, such as data imbalance, time and space demand and the selection of base detectors. To this end, we propose a selective ensemble method for anomaly detection based on parallel learning (SEAD-PL). First, a differentiated stratified sampling method is designed to alleviate the problem of data imbalance. Then, a distributed parallel training frame is built to address the problem of excessive time and space consumption for base detector training. Finally, a clustering-based ensemble selection strategy is introduced to balance the accuracy and diversity of base detectors. Experiments are performed on six datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed method has obvious advantages over four selected methods.",

        "Title": "Can factor substitution reduce the shadow price of air pollution embodied in international trade? A worldwide perspective.",
        "Abstract": "The calculation of trade-embodied air pollution (TEAP) and its economic losses can be reasonably used to assess the impact of transboundary air pollution. However, these air pollutants, which are associated with international trade, can be easily ignored due to their concealment. Based on this, the global multiregional input\u2012output model (MRIO) is used to quantify the volume of five air pollutants that are embodied in the trade of 20 countries from 2000 to 2016. Then, the shadow price of trade-embodied air pollution (SPTEAP) and the elasticity of factor substitution (EFS) are both calculated by applying the translog production function. Finally, impulse response analysis is used to study the dynamic impact of EFS on the SPTEAP. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) All countries experienced a mass transfer of TEAP, among which China and the USA are the developing and developed countries with the largest amount of TEAP transfers, respectively. (2) The SPTEAP and EFS vary greatly among countries, and these values are generally higher in developed countries than in developing countries. The relationship between the three EFSs can be expressed as [Formula: see text] in all countries, thus indicating that improving the technological level of a country is the best solution for reducing the TEAP in that country while incurring the lowest cost and the least difficulty. (3) Over the long run, the increase in [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] reduces the SPTEAP. Conversely, an increase in [Formula: see text] increases the SPTEAP. Therefore, policymakers should weigh these three factors according to the fluctuation of the SPTEAP and constantly adjust the allocation structure and ratio of these factors to maximize the benefits of transboundary air pollution governance.",

        "Abstract": "Intestinal microecology is a dominant and complex microecological system in human body. Generally, intestinal microecosystem consists of normal symbiotic flora and its living environment (including intestinal epithelial tissue and intestinal mucosal immune system). Commensal flora is the core component of microecology. Both structures of intestinal mucosa and functions of immune system are essential to maintain homeostasis of intestinal microecosystem. Under normal conditions, intestinal microorganisms and intestinal mucosa coordinate with each other to promote host immunity. When certain factors in the intestine are altered, such as disruption of the intestinal barrier causing dysbiosis of the intestinal flora, the immune system of the host intestinal mucosa makes a series of responses, which leads to the development of intestinal inflammation and promotes colorectal cancer. In this review, to further understand the relationship between intestinal microecology and intestinal diseases, we systematically elaborate the composition of the intestinal mucosal immune system, analyze the relationship between intestinal flora and mucosal immune system, and the role of intestinal flora on intestinal inflammatory diseases and colorectal cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Aramid nanofibers (ANFs) as an innovative nanoscale building block exhibit great potential for novel high-performance multifunctional membranes attributed to their extraordinary performance. However, the application of aramid nanofibers in the field of surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensing has been rarely reported. In this work, aramid nanofibers derived from commercial Kevlar fibers were synthesized by a facile dimethyl sulfoxide/potassium hydroxide (DMSO/KOH) solution treatment. The monodispersed silver nanoparticle-decorated aramid nanofiber (m-Ag@ANF) membranes were constructed by an efficient vacuum filtration technique. Taking advantages of unique intrinsic properties of ANF, the m-Ag@ANF substrates exhibit good flexibility, excellent mechanical properties and prominent thermal stability. Besides, due to the abundance of positively charged amino-group on the ANF substrates, the negatively charged m-AgNPs were uniformly and firmly deposited on the surface of ANF substrate through electrostatic interactions. As a result, the optimal flexible m-Ag-9@ANF SERS substrate exhibits high sensitivity of 10",

        "Abstract": "Whether epigenetic modifications participate in the cell apoptosis after ischemic stroke remains unclear. Histone 3 tri-methylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is a histone modification that leads to gene silencing and is involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Since the expression of many antiapoptotic genes is inhibited in the ischemic brains, here we aimed to offer an epigenetic solution to cell apoptosis after stroke by reversing H3K27me3 levels after ischemia. GSK-126, a specific inhibitor of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), significantly decreased H3K27me3 levels and inhibited middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induced and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, GSK-126 attenuated the apoptosis caused by oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and excessive inflammatory responses in vitro. The role of H3K27me3 in regulating of the expression of the antiapoptotic molecule B cell lymphoma-2 like 1 (Bcl2l1) explained the antiapoptotic effect of GSK-126. In conclusion, we found that GSK-126 could effectively protect brain cells from apoptosis after cerebral ischemia, and this role of GSK-126 is closely related to an axis that regulates Bcl2l1 expression, beginning with the regulation of EZH2-dependent H3K27me3 modification.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate estimation of grassland leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and aboveground biomass (AGB) is fundamental in grassland studies. The newly launched Ocean and Land Color Imager (OLCI) sensor onboard Sentinel-3 (S3) provides images with comparable spatial and spectral resolution with MODIS data. However, the use of S3 OLCI imageries for vegetation variable estimation is rarely evaluated. This study evaluated the potential of S3 OLCI and MODIS data for estimating grassland LAI, FVC, and AGB in the eastern Eurasian steppe. A Bayesian spatial model (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation with Stochastic Partial Differential Equation, INLA-SPDE) was used to address spatial autocorrelation of in-situ observation data and to enhance our predictions. Our results showed that the models based on S3 OLCI data presented higher accuracy than models with MODIS data. The RMSEs decreased by 3.7-10.8\u00a0%, 3.7-7.5\u00a0%, and 1.6-14.2\u00a0% for LAI, FVC, and AGB predictions, respectively. Through combinations of multiple predictors, we confirmed the robustness of red edge bands for grassland variable estimation, the models employing red edge variables yielded 3.5\u00a0%, 3.2\u00a0%, and 0.4\u00a0% lower RMSEs than models with conventional visible and NIR bands for LAI, FVC, and AGB prediction, respectively. INLA-SPDE spatial model produced lower bias and higher prediction accuracy than random forest and random forests kriging method in most of the models; the INLA-SPDE predicted LAI and FVC maps also showed a better agreement with ground observations than MODIS and PROBA-V land products.",

        "Abstract": "Optical multiplexing for nanoscale object recognition is of great significance within the intricate domains of biology, medicine, anti-counterfeiting, and microscopic imaging. Traditionally, the multiplexing dimensions of nanoscopy are limited to emission intensity, color, lifetime, and polarization. Here, a novel dimension, optical nonlinearity, is proposed for super-resolved multiplexing microscopy. This optical nonlinearity is attributable to the energy transitions between multiple energy levels of the doped lanthanide ions in upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), resulting in unique optical fingerprints for UCNPs with different compositions. A vortex beam is applied to transport the optical nonlinearity onto the imaging point-spread function (PSF), creating a robust super-resolved multiplexing imaging strategy for differentiating UCNPs with distinctive optical nonlinearities. The composition information of the nanoparticles can be retrieved with variations of the corresponding PSF in the obtained image. Four channels multiplexing super-resolved imaging with a single scanning, applying emission color and nonlinearity of two orthogonal imaging dimensions with a spatial resolution higher than 150\u00a0nm (1/6.5\u03bb), are demonstrated. This work provides a new and orthogonal dimension - optical nonlinearity - to existing multiplexing dimensions, which shows great potential in bioimaging, anti-counterfeiting, microarray assays, deep tissue multiplexing detection, and high-density data storage.",

        "Abstract": "Green nanotechnology is considered a promising method to construct functional materials with significant anticancer activity, while overcoming the shortcomings of traditional synthesis process complexity and high organic solvents consumption. Thus, in this study, we report for the first time the rational design and green synthesis of functionalized 5-fluorouracil and curcumin co-loaded lysozyme-hyaluronan composite colloidal nanoparticles (5-Fu/Cur@LHNPs) for better targeted colorectal cancer therapy with minimized side effects. The functionalized 5-Fu/Cur@LHNPs exhibit stabilized particle size (126.1\u00a0nm) with excellent homogeneity (PDI\u00a0=\u00a00.1), favorable colloidal stabilities, and excellent re-dispersibility. In vitro cell experiments illustrate that the cellular uptake of 5-Fu/Cur@LHNPs was significantly improved and further promoted a higher apoptosis ratio of HCT-116 cells. Compared with the control group, the 5-Fu/Cur@LHNPs formulation group achieved effective inhibition (60.1\u00a0%) of colorectal tumor growth. The alcohol-free self-assembly method to construct 5-Fu/Cur@LHNPs is simple and safe for a translational chemotherapy drug, also to promote more robust delivery systems for treating colorectal cancer.",

        "Title": "Distribution characteristics of non-point source pollution of TP and identification of key source areas in Nanyi Lake (China) Basin: based on InVEST model and source list method.",
        "Abstract": "The Nanyi Lake basin, located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, is a crucial component of the Yangtze River ecosystem. Excessive phosphorus levels lead to eutrophication in rivers and lakes. This study aims to enhance the identification efficiency of key source areas for non-point source pollution of total phosphorus (TP) in the Nanyi Lake Basin and improve decision-making regarding the treatment of these areas. The study employs the InVEST model and utilizes GIS spatial hot spot analysis to identify key source areas of agricultural TP non-point source pollution. The accuracy of the InVEST model's simulation results was verified using the source list method. The findings indicate that paddy fields serve as the primary pollution source. TP non-point source pollution in Nanyi Lake is influenced by pollution sources, pollution load filtration rate, and potential TP runoff mass concentration. Different pollution sources correspond to distinct key source areas, and the pollution generated by these sources in different administrative regions, ultimately affecting the lake, varies as well. The InVEST model demonstrates great applicability in regions where agricultural TP is the primary pollution source. For the Nanyi Lake basin, which predominantly experiences agricultural TP non-point source pollution, a combination of the InVEST model and the source list method is recommended. The InVEST model serves as the primary tool, while the source list method supplements it. This approach not only compensates for any limitations of the InVEST model's simulation results but also avoids unnecessary economic waste. The outcomes of this study contribute to a deeper scientific understanding of TP pollution in the Nanyi Lake Basin. They also aid in effectively identifying key source areas and formulating appropriate measures based on the pollution characteristics, thereby providing guidance for non-point source pollution control in the basin.",

        "Abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) regenerate after myeloablation, a procedure that adversely disrupts the bone marrow and drives leptin receptor-expressing cells, a key niche component, to differentiate extensively into adipocytes. Regeneration of the bone marrow niche is associated with the resolution of adipocytes, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using Plin1-creER knock-in mice, we followed the fate of adipocytes in the regenerating niche in vivo. We found that bone marrow adipocytes were highly dynamic and dedifferentiated to leptin receptor-expressing cells during regeneration after myeloablation. Bone marrow adipocytes could give rise to osteolineage cells after skeletal injury. The cellular fate of steady-state bone marrow adipocytes was also plastic. Deletion of adipose triglyceride lipase (Atgl) from bone marrow stromal cells, including adipocytes, obstructed adipocyte dedifferentiation and led to severely compromised regeneration of HSCs as well as impaired B lymphopoiesis after myeloablation, but not in the steady state. Thus, the regeneration of HSCs and their niche depends on the cellular plasticity of bone marrow adipocytes.",

        "Abstract": "MCM4 forms the pre-replication complex (MCM2-7) with five other minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins. This complex binds to replication origins at G1 stage in cell cycle process, playing a critical role in DNA replication initiation. Recently, MCM4 is reported to have a complex interaction with multiple cancer progression, including gastric, ovarian and cervical cancer. Here, this study mainly focused on the expression of MCM4 and its values in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). MCM4 was highly expressed in LUAD tumours and cells, and had an important effect on the overall survival. Overexpression of MCM4 promoted the proliferation, and suppressed the apoptosis in LUAD cells. However, MCM4 silence led to the opposite results. In vivo, knockdown of MCM4 inhibited tumour volume and weight in xenograft mouse model. As a member of DNA helicase, knockdown of MCM4 caused cell cycle arrest at G1 stage through inducing the expression of P21, a CDK inhibitor. These findings indicate that MCM4 may be a possible new therapeutic target for LUAD in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Since its development, spinal cord functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has utilized various methodologies and stimulation protocols to develop a deeper understanding of a healthy human spinal cord that lays a foundation for its use in clinical research and practice. In this review, we conducted a comprehensive literature search on spinal cord fMRI studies and summarized the recent advancements and resulting scientific achievements of spinal cord fMRI in the following three aspects: the current state of spinal cord fMRI methodologies and stimulation protocols, knowledge about the healthy spinal cord's functions obtained via spinal cord fMRI, and fMRI's exemplary usage in spinal cord diseases and injuries. We conclude with a discussion that, while technical challenges exist, novel fMRI technologies for and new knowledge about the healthy human spinal cord have been established. Empowered by these developments, investigations of pathological and injury states within the spinal cord have become the next important direction of spinal cord fMRI. Recent clinical investigations into spinal cord pathologies, for example, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and cervical spondylotic myelopathy, have already provided deep insights into spinal cord impairments and the time course of impairment-caused changes. We expect that future spinal cord fMRI advancement and research development will further enhance our understanding of various spinal cord diseases and provide the foundation for evaluating existing and developing new treatment plans.",

        "Title": "Driving impact and spatial effect of the digital economy development on carbon emissions in typical cities: a case study of Zhejiang, China.",
        "Abstract": "The digital economy (DE) not only drives economic innovation and development but also has significant environmental effects by promoting lower carbon emissions. To investigate the spatial effects of DE on urban carbon emissions, this study comprehensively measures the level of DE development based on the panel data from 11 typical cities in Zhejiang Province from 2011 to 2020, by comparing analysis using different regression models. The following conclusions are obtained: (1) The total carbon emissions (TC) of Zhejiang cities in general show a fluctuating change trend of first increasing and then slowly decreasing, while carbon emission intensity and carbon emission per capita in general show a fluctuating change trend of decreasing. Cities with high TC are primarily concentrated in the Hangzhou Bay city cluster, accounted for 62\u2009~\u200965% of the province's carbon emissions. The development of the DE in Zhejiang cities shows steady growth, but there are large differences among cities, with Hangzhou and Ningbo standing out as particularly prominent. (2) There is a significant inverted U-shaped relationship between the DE and the level of carbon emissions in Zhejiang Province. The influence coefficient of the DE on the primary term of TC is 0.613, and the influence coefficient of the quadratic term of TC is\u2009-\u20091.008. (3) In terms of the spatial spillover effect of the DE on carbon emissions, the study finds that compared to the direct effect, the spatial spillover effect is not significant. However, the allocation of transport resources shows a positive spatial spillover effect (increasing carbon emissions, coefficient value is 0.138), while technological progress shows a somewhat negative spatial spillover effect (decreasing carbon emissions, coefficient value is\u2009-\u20090.035). (4) The study also finds that the smart city pilot policy significantly reduces urban carbon emissions. Moreover, the effect of the DE on carbon emissions is confirmed through the significance test of the quadratic term when replacing the geographical and economic distance weight matrices. This indicates that the empirical findings are robust to these tests. Finally, several countermeasures to reduce carbon emissions are proposed from the perspective of DE development.",

        "Abstract": "The effectiveness of thermal ablation for the treatment of liver tumours is limited by the risk of incomplete ablation, which can result in residual tumours. Herein, an enhancement strategy is proposed based on the controlled release of Ganoderma applanatum polysaccharide (GAP) liposome-microbubble complexes (GLMCs) via ultrasound (US)-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) and sublethal hyperthermic (SH) field. GLMCs were prepared by conjugating GAP liposomes onto the surface of microbubbles via biotin-avidin linkage. In vitro, UTMD promotes the cellular uptake of liposomes and leads to apoptosis of M2-like macrophages. Secretion of arginase-1 (Arg-1) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) by M2-like macrophages decreased. In vivo, restriction of tumour volume was observed in rabbit VX2 liver tumours after treatment with GLMCs via UTMD in GLMCs + SH\u00a0+\u00a0US group. The expression levels of CD68 and CD163, as markers of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the GLMCs + SH\u00a0+\u00a0US group were reduced in liver tumour tissue. Decreased Arg-1, TGF-\u03b2, Ki67, and CD31 factors related to tumour cell proliferation and angiogenesis was evident on histological analysis. In conclusion, thermal/US-triggered drug release from GLMCs suppressed rabbit VX2 liver tumour growth in the SH field by inhibiting TAMs, which represents a potential approach to improve the effectiveness of thermal ablation.",

        "Abstract": "Programmable smart textiles with adaptive moisture/heat conditioning (MHC) capabilities are globally being sought to meet the requirements of comfort, energy efficiency, and health protection. However, a universal strategy for fabricating truly scalable and customizable MHC textiles is lacking. In this study, we introduce a scalable in situ grafting approach for the continuous fabrication of two series of smart textile yarns with opposite thermoresponsive wetting behaviors. In particular, the wetting transition temperature can be precisely programmed by adjusting the grafting formula, making the yarns highly customizable. The smart yarns demonstrated excellent mechanical strength, whiteness, weavability, biocompatibility, and washability (with more than 60 home washes), comparable to those of regular textile yarns. They can serve as building blocks independently or in combination to create smart textiles with adaptive sweat wicking and intelligent moisture/heat regulation capabilities. A proposed hybrid textile integrating both the two series of smart yarns can offer dry-contact and cooling/keep-warming effects of approximately 1.6/2.8\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, in response to changes in ambient temperature. Our method provides a rich array of design options for nonpowered MHC textiles while maintaining a balance between traditional wearing conventions and large-scale production.",

        "Abstract": "Robust scaffolds were typically applied in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules to suppress the non-radiative decay, trigger the fast spin-flipping, and enhance the light out-coupling efficiency. Herein, we disclosed for the first time the positive effect of flexible conformation of ancillary groups on the photophysical properties of TADF emitter. The red TADF emitter Ph-TPA with flexible conformation demonstrated small excited-state structural distortion and low reorganization energy compared to the counterpart Mc-TPA with a rigid macrocycle. Consequently, Ph-TPA showed an excellent photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of 92\u2009% and a state-of-the-art external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.6\u2009% at 630\u2005nm. This work could deepen our understanding of structure-property relationships of organic luminophores and help us to rationalize the design of efficient TADF materials.",

A significantly higher proportion of patients age 70 and over received non-intensive therapy (NIT) in 2021-22 as compared with 2013-16 (65 % vs 44 %, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014), with a corresponding reduction in the proportion receiving either intensive therapy or no antileukemic treatment. Treatment patterns among patients < age 70 were unchanged. The complete response rate in the NIT group was 69 % in 2021-22 vs. 24 % in 2013-16 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); the overall survival (OS) of NIT patients was 11.5 months in 2021-22 vs. 7.8 months in 2013-16. Older patients from rural areas were more likely to decline therapy than those from urban regions. The increase in the proportion of patients opting for NIT may be related to the availability of more effective treatment options. Although outcomes are improving, the OS with NIT remains suboptimal.",

Acupuncture is widely used as adjuvant therapy for multiple metabolic diseases. However, detailed biological interpretation of the acupuncture stimulations is still limited. The gut and the liver are intrinsically connected and related to metabolic function. Microbial metabolites might affect the gut-liver axis through multiple mechanisms. Liver metabolomics and 16S rRNA sequencing were used to explore the specific mechanism of electroacupuncture in treating ZDF rats in this study. Electroacupuncture effectively improved glycolipid metabolism disorders of the ZDF rats. Histopathology confirmed that electroacupuncture improved diffuse hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte vacuolation, and promoted glycogen accumulation in the liver. The treatment significantly improved microbial diversity and richness and upregulated beneficial bacteria that maintain intestinal epithelial homeostasis and decreased bacteria with detrimental metabolic features on host metabolism. Liver metabolomics showed that the main effects of electroacupuncture include reducing the carbon flow and intermediate products in the TCA cycle, regulating the metabolism of various amino acids, and inhibiting hepatic glucose output and ",

        "Abstract": "We established an experimental apparatus by combining polarized light scattering and angle-resolved light scattering measurement technology to rapidly identify the shape of an individual aerosol particle. The experimental data of scattered light of Oleic acid, rod-shaped Silicon dioxide, and other particles with typical shape characteristics were analyzed statistically. To better study the relationship between the shape of particles and the properties of scattered light, the partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) method was used to analyze the scattered light of aerosol samples based on the size screening of particles, and the shape recognition and classification method of the individual aerosol particle was established based on the analysis of the spectral data after nonlinear processing and grouping by particle size with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as reference. The experimental results show that the proposed classification method has a good discrimination ability for spherical, rod-shaped, and other non-spherical particles, which can provide more information for atmospheric aerosol measurement, and has application value for traceability and exposure hazard assessment of aerosol particles.",

        "Abstract": "Cancer cells consistently utilize the unfolded protein response (UPR) to encounter the abnormal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Extreme activation of the UPR could also provoke maladaptive cell death. Previous reports have shown that NRF2 antioxidant signaling is activated by UPR and serves as noncanonical pathway to defense and reduce excessive ROS levels during ER stress. However, the mechanisms of regulating NRF2 signaling upon ER stress in glioblastoma have not been fully elucidated. Here we identify that SMURF1 protects against ER stress and facilitates glioblastoma cell survival by rewiring KEAP1-NRF2 pathway. We show that ER stress induces SMURF1 degradation. Knockdown of SMURF1 upregulates IRE1 and PERK signaling in the UPR pathway and prevents ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) activity, leading to cell apoptosis. Importantly, SMURF1 overexpression activates NRF2 signaling to reduce ROS levels and alleviate UPR-mediated cell death. Mechanistically, SMURF1 interacts with and ubiquitinates KEAP1 for its degradation (NRF2 negative regulator), resulting in NRF2 nuclear import. Moreover, SMURF1 loss reduces glioblastoma cell proliferation and growth in subcutaneously implanted nude mice xenografts. Taken together, SMURF1 rewires KEAP1-NRF2 pathway to confer resistance to ER stress inducers and protect glioblastoma cell survival. ER stress and SMURF1 modulation may provide promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of glioblastoma.",

In breast cancer, a high level of expression of DNMTs is highly correlated with poor prognosis, that is, the abnormal methylation of tumor suppressor genes usually promotes tumorigenesis and progression. MiRNAs, as non-coding RNAs, have been identified to play key roles in breast cancer. The aberrant methylation of miRNAs could lead to drug resistance during the aforementioned treatment. Therefore, the regulation of miRNA methylation might serve as a therapeutic target in breast cancer. In this paper, we reviewed studies on the regulatory mechanisms of miRNA and DNA methylation in breast cancer from the last decade, focusing on the promoter region of tumor suppressor miRNAs methylated by DNMTs and the highly expressed oncogenic miRNAs inhibited by DNMTs or activating TETs.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies revealed the relationship among homologous recombination repair (HRR), androgen receptor (AR), and poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP); however, the synergy between anti-androgen enzalutamide (ENZ) and PARP inhibitor olaparib (OLA) remains unclear. Here, we showed that the synergistic effect of ENZ and OLA significantly reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines. Next-generation sequencing followed by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses revealed the significant effects of ENZ plus OLA on nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and apoptosis pathways. ENZ combined with OLA synergistically inhibited the NHEJ pathway by repressing DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and X-ray repair cross complementing 4 (XRCC4). Moreover, our data showed that ENZ could enhance the response of prostate cancer cells to the combination therapy by reversing the anti-apoptotic effect of OLA through the downregulation of anti-apoptotic gene insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor ( IGF1R ) and the upregulation of pro-apoptotic gene death-associated protein kinase 1 ( DAPK1 ). Collectively, our results suggested that ENZ combined with OLA can promote prostate cancer cell apoptosis by multiple pathways other than inducing HRR defects, providing evidence for the combined use of ENZ and OLA in prostate cancer regardless of HRR gene mutation status.",

        "Abstract": "Both depression and sleep disturbance have been linked to inflammation. However, the role that inflammation plays in the relationship between sleep disturbance and depression remains unclear. We examined pairwise associations between inflammatory markers (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [NLR] and C-reactive protein level [CRP]), sleep disturbance, and depressive symptoms in a robust, ethnically diverse sample (n\u00a0=\u00a032,749) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We found higher levels of inflammatory markers in participants with depression and/or sleep disturbance compared to those without depression or sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbance was positively associated with inflammatory markers and depressive symptoms even after considering a wide range of potential confounders (e.g., age, sex, body mass index). Inflammatory marker levels were nonlinearly associated with depressive symptoms and were positively associated with depressive symptoms after reaching the inflection point (NLR, 1.67; CRP, 0.22\u00a0mg/dL). Inflammatory markers mediated a marginal portion (NLR, 0.0362%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026; CRP, 0.0678%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.018) of the potential effects of sleep disturbance on depressive symptoms. Our research showed that inflammatory markers, sleep disturbance, and depression are pairwise correlated. Increased inflammatory markers levels slightly mediate the association between sleep disturbance and depression.",

        "Abstract": "Based on the negative curvature structure, we design a graded-index photonic crystal fiber (GI-PCF) supporting the orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode transmission and discuss its optimization strategy. The core of the designed GI-PCF is sandwiched by three-layer inner air-hole arrays with gradually decreasing air-hole radii and a single outer air-hole array, where the inner side of the annular core forms a graded refractive index distribution. All these structures are clad with negative-curvature tubes. By optimizing characteristic structural parameters, including the air-filling fraction of the outer array, the air-hole radii of the inner arrays, and the thickness of the tubes, the GI-PCF can support 42 OAM modes and most of them have a purity greater than 85%. Compared with conventional structures, the present design of GI-PCF has better properties on an overall level, which can stably transmit multiple OAM modes with high mode purity. These results inject new interest in the flexible design of PCF and have potential applications in various fields, including but not limited to the mode division multiplexing system and terabit data transmission.",

        "Abstract": "Background Collagenases are frequently used in chondrocyte isolation from articular cartilage. However, the sufficiency of this enzyme in establishing primary human chondrocyte culture remains unknown. Methods Cartilage slices shaved from femoral head or tibial plateau of patients receiving total joint replacement surgery (16 hips, 8 knees) were subjected to 0.02% collagenase IA digestion for 16\u00a0h with (N\u2009=\u200919) or without (N\u2009=\u20095) the pre-treatment of 0.4% pronase E for 1.5\u00a0h. Chondrocyte yield and viability were compared between two groups. Chondrocyte phenotype was determined by the expression ratio of collagen type II to I. The morphology of cultured chondrocytes was monitored with a light microscope.Results Cartilage with pronase E pre-treatment yielded significantly higher chondrocytes than that without the pre-treatment (3,399\u2009\u00b1\u20091,637 cells/mg wet cartilage vs. 1,895\u2009\u00b1\u2009688 cells/mg wet cartilage; P\u2009=\u20090.0067). Cell viability in the former group was also significantly higher than that in the latter (94%\u2009\u00b1\u20092% vs. 86%\u2009\u00b1\u20096%; P\u2009=\u20090.03). When cultured in monolayers, cells from cartilage with pronase E pre-treatment grew in a single plane showing rounded shape while cells from the other group grew in multi-planes and exhibited irregular shape. The mRNA expression ratio of collagen type II to I was 13.2\u2009\u00b1\u20097.5 in cells isolated from cartilage pre-treated with pronase E, indicating a typical chondrocyte phenotype. Conclusions Collagenase IA was not sufficient in establishing primary human chondrocyte culture. Cartilage must be treated with pronase E prior to collagenase IA application.",

        "Abstract": "Pesticide residue has become the main technical barrier that restricts the export of Chinese wolfberry. Can we achieve high efficacy and low safety risk by balancing pesticide deposition on the leaves and fruits of Chinese wolfberry? In this research, the structural characteristics and wettability of leaves and fruits of Chinese wolfberry at different growth stages were studied. The adaxial and abaxial surfaces of leaves were hydrophobic, whereas the fruit surfaces were hydrophilic. Adding spray adjuvant could increase the retention of droplets on the leaf surfaces of Chinese wolfberry by 52.28-97.89% and reduce the retention on the fruit surfaces by 21.68-42.14%. A structural equation model analysis showed that the adhesion tension was the key factor affecting the retention of the solutions among various interface behaviors. When the concentrations of Silwet618, AEO-5, Gemini 31551, and 1227 were 2-5 times higher than their CMCs, the retention of pesticide solutions (pyraclostrobin and tylophorine) on Chinese wolfberry leaves significantly increased, and the control efficacies on aphids and powdery mildew also dramatically improved (65.90-105.15 and 41.18-133.06%, respectively). Meanwhile, the retention of pesticides on the fruit of Chinese wolfberry was reduced. This study provides new insights into increasing the utilization of pesticides in controlling pests and improving food safety.",

        "Abstract": "Growing evidence has proved that RNA editing enzyme ADAR1, responsible for detecting endogenous RNA species, was significantly associated with poor response or resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Here, a genetically engineered nanovesicle (siAdar1-LNP@mPD1) was developed as an RNA interference nano-tool to overcome tumor resistance to ICB therapies. Small interfering RNA against ADAR1 (siAdar1) was packaged into a lipid nanoparticle (LNP), which was further coated with plasma membrane extracted from the genetically engineered cells overexpressing PD1. siAdar1-LNP@mPD1 could block the PD1/PDL1 immune inhibitory axis by presenting the PD1 protein on the coating membranes. Furthermore, siAdar1 could be effectively delivered into cancer cells by the designed nanovesicle to silence ADAR1 expression, resulting in an increased type I/II interferon (IFN-\u03b2/\u03b3) production and making the cancer cells more sensitive to secreted effector cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 with significant cell growth arrest. These integrated functions confer siAdar1-LNP@mPD1 with robust and comprehensive antitumor immunity, as evidenced by significant tumor growth regression, abscopal tumor prevention, and effective suppression of lung metastasis, through a global remodeling of the tumor immune microenvironment. Overall, we provided a promising translatable strategy to simultaneously silence ADAR1 and block PDL1 immune checkpoint to boost robust antitumor immunity.",

Taking the CDK2/4/6 inhibitor Ebvaciclib as the positive control and an in-house library compound (23) as the lead compound, three classes of 30 target compounds with pteridin-7(8H)-one as the core structure were designed to establish structure-activity relationships (SAR). In general, SAR of pteridin-7(8H)-one CDK2 inhibitors is systematically described in this paper, resulting in the discovery of two compounds (KII-17 and KII-21) with further research value. After the above compounds were tested for CDK2/4/6 kinase selectivity, we found that compound KII-21 was about 3 and 4 times more selective to CDK2-cyclinE2 than CDK4-cyclinD1 and CDK6-cyclinD3, respectively.

        "Abstract": "Culturomics employs various cultivating conditions to obtain different types of bacteria and new species. However, current culturomics lacks a highly efficient method for isolating specific pathobionts. Immunomagnetic bead technology, which uses magnetic beads conjugated with antibodies for capturing the antigen to realize enrichment of the targets, has been employed as an alternative method. In this study, we developed a novel method, immunomagnetic bead-enriched culturomics (IMBEC), in which magnetic bead-conjugated antibodies purified from the fecal samples of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) were used to enrich and isolate potential pathobionts. A protocol for enriching potential pathobionts via immunomagnetic capture was developed by optimizing the concentrations of coupling reagents, NaCl, and detergent. The efficacy of pathobiont enrichment was compared between antibody-coated magnetic beads (antibody group) and nonconjugated blank magnetic beads (blank group). To determine the proinflammatory potential of isolates from both groups, we investigated their ability to induce cytokine production in THP-1 macrophages. This protocol was employed for isolating bacteria from 10 fecal samples of patients with CRC, which were simultaneously compared with those isolated from the blank group. A total of 209 bacterial species were isolated from both groups, including 173 from the antibody group, 160 from the blank group, and 124 from both groups. Bacteria isolated from the antibody group produced more proinflammatory cytokines than those isolated from the blank group. IMBEC is a promising method for relatively specific isolation of potential pathobionts for a particular disease of interest.",

        "Abstract": "Getting access to administrative health data for research purposes is a difficult and time-consuming process due to increasingly demanding privacy regulations. An alternative method for sharing administrative health data would be to share synthetic datasets where the records do not correspond to real individuals, but the patterns and relationships seen in the data are reproduced. This paper assesses the feasibility of generating synthetic administrative health data using a recurrent deep learning model. Our data comes from 120,000 individuals from Alberta Health's administrative health database. We assess how similar our synthetic data is to the real data using utility assessments that assess the structure and general patterns in the data as well as by recreating a specific analysis in the real data commonly applied to this type of administrative health data. We also assess the privacy risks associated with the use of this synthetic dataset. Generic utility assessments that used Hellinger distance to quantify the difference in distributions between real and synthetic datasets for event types (0.027), attributes (mean 0.0417), Markov transition matrices (order 1 mean absolute difference: 0.0896, sd: 0.159; order 2: mean Hellinger distance 0.2195, sd: 0.2724), the Hellinger distance between the joint distributions was 0.352, and the similarity of random cohorts generated from real and synthetic data had a mean Hellinger distance of 0.3 and mean Euclidean distance of 0.064, indicating small differences between the distributions in the real data and the synthetic data. By applying a realistic analysis to both real and synthetic datasets, Cox regression hazard ratios achieved a mean confidence interval overlap of 68% for adjusted hazard ratios among 5 key outcomes of interest, indicating synthetic data produces similar analytic results to real data. The privacy assessment concluded that the attribution disclosure risk associated with this synthetic dataset was substantially less than the typical 0.09 acceptable risk threshold. Based on these metrics our results show that our synthetic data is suitably similar to the real data and could be shared for research purposes thereby alleviating concerns associated with the sharing of real data in some circumstances.",

        "Abstract": "Over the course of 20 years, from 1999 to 2018, the Chinese Go League has gradually developed and flourished, becoming a significant part of urban sports culture. Using mathematical statistics, spatiotemporal trajectory, and geospatial analysis, this research investigates the spatiotemporal distribution pattern and diffusive evolution characteristics of Chinese Go League clubs from the perspective of sports geography. The results of this study show that the following: (1) Over the past 20 years, the number of Chinese Go League clubs has increased in a \"stepped\" pattern, and there is still plenty of room for expansion. (2) Chinese Go League clubs are primarily located in municipalities directly under the central government and provincial capital cities (accounting for 82.6% of the total), with the Bohai Rim, Yangtze River Delta, and Southwest region of China forming a spatial pattern. (3) Host cities of Chinese Go League clubs are generally discrete, with clustering and random distribution occurring only seldom. The spatial distribution also tends to favor southern cities. (4) Chinese Go League clubs frequently change their names and host cities, and they have a variety of links with those cities, which primarily includes urban stability, urban transition, and urban fluctuation. In future, the professionalization and sustainable development of Chinese Go industry can be enhanced by the marketability of Chinese Go clubs, developing new markets for Chinese Go, and building a healthy development model with multiple linkages of Chinese Go clubs, sponsors, and host cities.",

        "Abstract": "Tripartite Motif Protein 72 (TRIM72, also named MG53) mediates membrane damage repair through membrane fusion and exocytosis. During injury, TRIM72 molecules form intermolecular disulfide bonds in response to the oxidative environment and TRIM72 oligomers are proposed to connect vesicles to the plasma membrane and promote membrane fusion in conjunction with other partners like dysferlin and caveolin. However, the detailed mechanism of TRIM72 oligomerization and action remains unclear. Here we present the crystal structure of TRIM72 B-box-coiled-coil-SPRY domains (BCC-SPRY), revealing the molecular basis of TRIM72 oligomerization, which is closely linked to disulfide bond formation. Through structure-guided mutagenesis, we have identified and characterized key residues that are important for the membrane repair function of TRIM72. Our results also demonstrate that TRIM72 interacts with several kinds of negatively charged lipids in addition to phosphatidylserine. Our work provides a structural foundation for further mechanistic studies as well as the clinical application of TRIM72.",

The bioconjugation of fluoroalkyl ligands onto cargo peptides greatly enhances their proteolytic stability and membrane penetration via a proposed \"fluorine effect\". The tagged peptides also efficiently deliver other biomolecules such as DNA and siRNA into cells via a co-assembly strategy. The fluoroalkyl chains on peptides with antifouling properties enable efficient gene delivery in the presence of serum proteins. Besides intracellular biomolecule delivery, the amphiphilic peptides can be used to stabilized perfluorocarbon-filled microbubbles for ultrasound imaging. The fluorine nucleus on fluoroalkyls provides intrinsic probes for background-free magnetic resonance imaging. Labeling of fluorous tags with radionuclide ",

        "Abstract": "A two-terminal (2T) perovskite/silicon heterojunction tandem solar cell (PVSK/SHJ) is considered one of the most promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaics with the possibility of achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 30% at low production cost. However, the current mismatch and voltage loss have seriously decreased the performance of 2T PVSK/SHJ tandem solar cells. Here, we report the composition engineering for perovskite top cells to prepare a high performance 2T tandem cell by tuning CsBr co-evaporating rates and increasing concentrations of FAI/FABr solutions. We show that the variation in composition for the perovskite absorber effectively optimized the band gap and diminished the defects of the top cell. Our investigations reveal that the current mismatch of sub-cells was carefully tuned by introducing CsBr at varied co-evaporating rates and the voltage loss was decreased by increasing concentrations of FAI/FABr solutions. Thus, we achieved a PCE of 23.22% in two-terminal monolithic tandems with an area of 1.2 cm",

        "Abstract": "pNENs are relative indolent tumors with heterogeneous clinical presentation at diagnosis. It is important to establish aggressive subgroups of pNENs and identify potential therapeutic targets. Patients with pNEN (322 cases) were included to examine the association between glycosylation biomarkers and clinical/pathological traits. The molecular and metabolic features stratified by glycosylation status were assessed by RNA-seq/whole exome sequencing and immunohistochemistry. A considerable proportion of patients had elevated glycosylation biomarkers (carbohydrate antigen [CA] 19-9, 11.9%; CA125, 7.5%; carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], 12.8%). CA19-9 (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a02.26, P\u00a0=\u00a0.019), CA125 (HR\u00a0=\u00a03.79, P\u00a0=\u00a0.004) and CEA (HR\u00a0=\u00a03.16, P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) were each independent prognostic variables for overall survival. High glycosylation group, defined as pNENs with elevated level of circulating CA19-9, CA125 or CEA, accounted for 23.4% of all pNENs. High glycosylation (HR\u00a0=\u00a03.14, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001) was an independent prognostic variable for overall survival and correlated with G3 grade (P\u2009<\u2009.001), poor differentiation (P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), perineural invasion (P\u00a0=\u00a0.004) and distant metastasis (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was enriched in high glycosylation pNENs using RNA-seq. EGFR was expressed in 21.2% of pNENs using immunohistochemistry and associated with poor overall survival (P\u00a0=\u00a0.020). A clinical trial focusing on EGFR expressed pNENs was initiated (NCT05316480). Thus, pNEN with aberrant glycosylation correlates with a dismal outcome and suggests potential therapeutic target of EGFR.",

        "Title": "Less is more: balancing noise reduction and data retention in fMRI with data-driven scrubbing.",
        "Abstract": "Functional MRI (fMRI) data may be contaminated by artifacts arising from a myriad of sources, including subject head motion, respiration, heartbeat, scanner drift, and thermal noise. These artifacts cause deviations from common distributional assumptions, introduce spatial and temporal outliers, and reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of the data-all of which can have negative consequences for the accuracy and power of downstream statistical analysis. Scrubbing is a technique for excluding fMRI volumes thought to be contaminated by artifacts and generally comes in two flavors. Motion scrubbing based on subject head motion-derived measures is popular but suffers from a number of drawbacks, among them the need to choose a threshold, a lack of generalizability to multiband acquisitions, and high rates of censoring of individual volumes and entire subjects. Alternatively, data-driven scrubbing methods like DVARS are based on observed noise in the processed fMRI timeseries and may avoid some of these issues. Here we propose \"projection scrubbing\", a novel data-driven scrubbing method based on a statistical outlier detection framework and strategic dimension reduction, including independent component analysis (ICA), to isolate artifactual variation. We undertake a comprehensive comparison of motion scrubbing with data-driven projection scrubbing and DVARS. We argue that an appropriate metric for the success of scrubbing is maximal data retention subject to reasonable performance on typical benchmarks such as the validity, reliability, and identifiability of functional connectivity. We find that stringent motion scrubbing yields worsened validity, worsened reliability, and produced small improvements to fingerprinting. Meanwhile, data-driven scrubbing methods tend to yield greater improvements to fingerprinting while not generally worsening validity or reliability. Importantly, however, data-driven scrubbing excludes a fraction of the number of volumes or entire sessions compared to motion scrubbing. The ability of data-driven fMRI scrubbing to improve data retention without negatively impacting the quality of downstream analysis has major implications for sample sizes in population neuroscience research.",

        "Title": "The Mechanism of Hyperglycemia-Induced Renal Cell Injury in Diabetic Nephropathy Disease: An Update.",
        "Abstract": "Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) is a serious complication of type I and II diabetes. It develops from the initial microproteinuria to end-stage renal failure. The main initiator for DN is chronic hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia (HG) can stimulate the resident and non-resident renal cells to produce humoral mediators and cytokines that can lead to functional and phenotypic changes in renal cells and tissues, interference with cell growth, interacting proteins, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), etc., ultimately resulting in glomerular and tubular damage and the onset of kidney disease. Therefore, poor blood glucose control is a particularly important risk factor for the development of DN. In this paper, the types and mechanisms of DN cell damage are classified and summarized by reviewing the related literature concerning the effect of hyperglycemia on the development of DN. At the cellular level, we summarize the mechanisms and effects of renal damage by hyperglycemia. This is expected to provide therapeutic ideas and inspiration for further studies on the treatment of patients with DN.",

        "Abstract": "Skeletal stem cells (SSCs) were originally discovered in the bone marrow stroma. They are capable of self-renewal and multilineage differentiation into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and stromal cells. Importantly, these bone marrow SSCs localize in the perivascular region and highly express hematopoietic growth factors to create the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. Thus, bone marrow SSCs play pivotal roles in orchestrating osteogenesis and hematopoiesis. Besides the bone marrow, recent studies have uncovered diverse SSC populations in the growth plate, perichondrium, periosteum, and calvarial suture at different developmental stages, which exhibit distinct differentiation potential under homeostatic and stress conditions. Therefore, the current consensus is that a panel of region-specific SSCs collaborate to regulate skeletal development, maintenance, and regeneration. Here, we will summarize recent advances of SSCs in long bones and calvaria, with a special emphasis on the evolving concept and methodology in the field. We will also look into the future of this fascinating research area that may ultimately lead to effective treatment of skeletal disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), the most lethal subtype of castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa), may evolve from the neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) of PCa cells. However, the molecular mechanism that triggers NED is unknown. Trigred motif 36 (TRIM36), a member of the TRIM protein family, exhibits oncogenic or anti-oncogenic roles in various cancers. We have previously reported that TRIM36 is highly expressed to inhibit the invasion and proliferation of PCa. In the present study, we first found that TRIM36 was lowly expressed in NEPC and its overexpression suppressed the NED of PCa. Next, based on proteomic analysis, we found that TRIM36 inhibited the glycolysis pathway through suppressing hexokinase 2 (HK2), a crucial glycolytic enzyme catalyzing the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. TRIM36 specifically bound to HK2 through lysine 48 (lys48)-mediated ubiquitination of HK2. Moreover, TRIM36-mediated ubiquitination degradation of HK2 downregulated the level of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), a process that contributed to ferroptosis. In conclusion, TRIM36 can inhibit glycolysis via lys48-mediated HK2 ubiquitination to reduce GPX4 expression and activate ferroptosis, thereby inhibiting the NED in PCa. Targeting TRIM36 might be a promising approach to retard NED and treat NEPC.",

        "Abstract": "Milk spectral data on 2118 cows from nine herds located in northern China were used to access the association of days open (DO). Meanwhile, the parity and calving season of dairy cows were also studied to characterize the difference in DO between groups of these two cow-level factors. The result of the linear mixed-effects model revealed that no significant differences were observed between the parity groups. However, a significant difference in DO exists between calving season groups. The interaction between parity and calving season presented that primiparous cows always exhibit lower DO among all calving season groups, and the variation in DO among parity groups was especially clearer in winter. Survival analysis revealed that the difference in DO between calving season groups might be caused by the different P/AI at the first TAI. In addition, the summer group had a higher chance of conception in the subsequent services than other groups, implying that the micro-environment featured by season played a critical role in P/AI. A weak linkage between DO and wavenumbers ranging in the mid-infrared region was detected. In summary, our study revealed that the calving season of dairy cows can be used to optimize the reproduction management. The potential application of mid-infrared spectroscopy in dairy cows needs to be further developed.",

        "Abstract": "Exosomes in the body fluid are effective cell-derived membranous structures transferring various molecules to mediate intercellular communication. The expression of protein in the urinary exosomes from the colorectal cancer (CRC) patients could reflect the characteristics of tumorigenesis. The urinary exosomes with globular membrane structure, the size of 30\u2009~\u2009100\u00a0nm and positive expression of CD9, CD63 and CD81 were successfully isolated from 9 CRC patients and 3 heathy adults using the density gradient ultracentrifugation. Proteome profiles revealed by label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) indicated that several proteins were differentially expressed among different stages of CRC. Compared with normal controls, 67 proteins in CRC urinary exosomes were upregulated and 74 proteins were downregulated. The bioinformatics analysis revealed the decreased proteins were related to ESCRT III complex disassembly. The CHMP family was further determined to be the hub of interaction network of proteins enriched in ESCRT signaling. The significant decrease of CHMP4A, CHMP4B, CHMP2A, CHMP2B and CHMP1B were respectively found in the total CRC group and distant metastasis group compared with NC group. Moreover, the CEACAM family also showed significant aberrant changes in the urinary exosomes of CRC patients. The CEACAM7 and CEACAM1 were increased in the CRC patients compared with healthy individuals (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Significant changes of proteomic profile could be found in the urinary exosomes in the CRC patients. The differential expressed urinary exosomes derived proteins showed potential usage in diagnosis and prognosis of CRC.",

        "Abstract": "Ecological security is the state achieved once an ecosystem maintains its stability under external stress. The Yellow River Basin (YRB) is the largest river basin in northwest and north China and an important area for grain and energy production. The assessment and attribution of ecological security in the YRB are important for protecting the natural environment and ensuring sustainable development. Here, the ecological security of the YRB was assessed by the ecological security index (ESI), a comprehensive index based on the oxygen cycle, and its drivers were attributed to climate change, human activities, vegetation, and soil factors. The spatial pattern of ecological security in the YRB showed high heterogeneity. Ecological insecurity occurred mainly in the middle reaches and regions where the major stream of the Yellow River passes through. The ESI decreased at a rate of\u2009-\u20090.82/year since 2000, which indicated the natural environment continued to be improved in the YRB. Climate change dominated the evolution of ecological security in the upper reaches. The level of ecological security has been improved in the middle reaches after a series of ecological restoration projects conducted. With higher intensity of industrial activity, human activities played a more critical role in ecological security in the lower reaches. Our results suggested that government and local people need to adopt different strategies and actions based on the dominant drivers in the upper, middle, and lower reaches to ensure protection of the natural environment and achieve sustainable development targets.",

Due to its portability and compatibility with medical implants, fNIRS has seen increasing applications in studying the hearing, language and cognitive functions. However, fNIRS is susceptible to artifacts related to jaw movements, such as teeth clenching, swallowing and speaking, which affect recordings over the temporal, parietal and frontal/prefrontal cortices.",

        "Title": "Antibiotic resistome in groundwater and its association with mountain springs and river.",
        "Abstract": "The distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in water sources potentially threatens drinking water safety. However, the sources of antibiotic resistome in groundwater are still under-investigated. Here, we evaluated the profiles of antibiotic resistome in peri-urban groundwater and its associated water sources (river and mountain spring) to characterize the antibiotic resistome from natural water sources on groundwater resistome. A total of 261 antibiotic resistome were detected in groundwater, mountain spring, and river samples. The relative abundances of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were significantly higher in the river samples than in spring water and groundwater samples. The resistome profiles were similar between groundwater and spring water but differed from the river samples. According to source tracking results, the groundwater resistome was likely to be derived from springs (28.0%-50.0%) and rivers (28.6%-48.6%), which share the same trend for the source tracking of bacterial communities. Bacterial \u03b1-diversity, bacterial \u03b2-diversity, and MGEs directly or indirectly affected the ARGs in groundwater samples. Although the abundance of groundwater resistome was not elevated by river and spring water, groundwater resistomes were diverse and may be derived from both river and spring water. We highlight the importance of groundwater resistome and its association with potential water sources, providing a better understanding and basis for the effective control of the ARG proliferation and dissemination in groundwater from exogenous water bodies in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Local feature matching is a part of many large vision tasks. Local feature matching usually consists of three parts: feature detection, description, and matching. The matching task usually serves a downstream task, such as camera pose estimation, so geometric information is crucial for the matching task. We propose the geometric feature embedding matching method (GFM) for local feature matching. We propose the adaptive keypoint geometric embedding module dynamic adjust keypoint position information and the orientation geometric embedding displayed modeling of geometric information about rotation. Subsequently, we interleave the use of self-attention and cross-attention for local feature enhancement. The predicted correspondences are multiplied by the local features. The correspondences are solved by computing dual-softmax. An intuitive human extraction and matching scheme is implemented. In order to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we performed validation on three datasets (MegaDepth, Hpatches, Aachen Day-Night v1.1) according to their respective metrics, and the results showed that our method achieved satisfactory results in all scenes.",

The research on fault diagnosis has been very active, but there is a lack of systematic analysis and summary of the developed methods. To make up for this gap, this paper systematically summarizes the relevant methods from the two aspects of fault diagnosis and health management. In addition, in order to further facilitate researchers and practitioners, statistical and comparative analysis of the reviewed methods is carried out, and a future development direction is prospected.",

        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary malignant brain tumor and is characterized by high mortality and morbidity rates and unpredictable clinical behavior. The disappointing prognosis for patients with GBM even after surgery and postoperative radiation and chemotherapy has fueled the search for specific targets to provide new insights into the development of modern therapies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) act as oncomirs and tumor suppressors to posttranscriptionally regulate the expression of various genes and silence many target genes involved in cell proliferation, the cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion, stem cell behavior, angiogenesis, the microenvironment and chemo- and radiotherapy resistance, which makes them attractive candidates as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets or agents to advance GBM therapeutics. However, one of the major challenges of successful miRNA-based therapy is the need for an effective and safe system to deliver therapeutic compounds to specific tumor cells or tissues in vivo, particularly systems that can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This challenge has shifted gradually as progress has been achieved in identifying novel tumor-related miRNAs and their targets, as well as the development of nanoparticles (NPs) as new carriers to deliver therapeutic compounds. Here, we provide an up-to-date summary (in recent 5 years) of the current knowledge of GBM-related oncomirs, tumor suppressors and microenvironmental miRNAs, with a focus on their potential applications as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, as well as recent advances in the development of carriers for nontoxic miRNA-based therapy delivery systems and how they can be adapted for therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Human mitochondrial transcription termination factor 1 (MTERF1) has been demonstrated to play an important role in mitochondrial gene expression regulation. However, the molecular mechanism of MTERF1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains largely unknown. Here, we found that MTERF1 expression was significantly increased in colon cancer tissues compared with normal colorectal tissue by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and tissue microarrays (TMA). Overexpression of MTERF1 in the HT29 cell promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and xenograft tumor formation, whereas knockdown of MTERF1 in HCT116 cells appeared to be the opposite phenotype to HT29 cells. Furthermore, MTERF1 can increase mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication, transcription, and protein synthesis in colorectal cancer cells; increase ATP levels, the mitochondrial crista density, mitochondrial membrane potential, and oxygen consumption rate (OCR); and reduce the ROS production in colorectal cancer cells, thereby enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity. Mechanistically, we revealed that MTERF1 regulates the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in cancerous cell lines, and we also confirmed the involvement of the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in both xenograft tumor tissues and colorectal cancer tissues. In summary, our data reveal an oncogenic role of MTERF1 in CRC progression, indicating that MTERF1 may represent a new therapeutic target in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Currently, using semantic segmentation networks to distinguish dynamic and static key points has become a mainstream designing method for semantic SLAM systems. However, the semantic SLAM systems must have prior semantic knowledge of relevant dynamic objects, and their processing speed is inversely proportional to the recognition accuracy. To simultaneously enhance the speed and accuracy for recognizing dynamic objects in different environments, a novel SLAM system without prior semantics called DGFlow-SLAM is proposed in this paper. A novel grid segmentation method is used in the system to segment the scene flow, and then an adaptive threshold method is used to roughly detect the dynamic objects. Based on this, a deep mean clustering segmentation method is applied to find potential dynamic targets. Finally, the results of grid segmentation and depth mean clustering segmentation are jointly used to find moving objects accurately, and all the feature points of the moving objects are removed on the premise of retaining the static part of the moving object. The experimental results show that on the dynamic sequence dataset of TUM RGB-D, compared with the DynaSLAM system with the highest accuracy for detecting moderate and violent motion and the DS-SLAM with the highest accuracy for detecting slight motion, DGflow-SLAM obtains similar accuracy results and improves the accuracy by 7.5%. In addition, DGflow-SLAM is 10 times and 1.27 times faster than DynaSLAM and DS-SLAM, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "A novel meta-heuristic algorithm named Egret Swarm Optimization Algorithm (ESOA) is proposed in this paper, which is inspired by two egret species' hunting behavior (Great Egret and Snowy Egret). ESOA consists of three primary components: a sit-and-wait strategy, aggressive strategy as well as discriminant conditions. The learnable sit-and-wait strategy guides the egret to the most probable solution by applying a pseudo gradient estimator. The aggressive strategy uses random wandering and encirclement mechanisms to allow for optimal solution exploration. The discriminant model is utilized to balance the two strategies. The proposed approach provides a parallel framework and a strategy for parameter learning through historical information that can be adapted to most scenarios and has well stability. The performance of ESOA on 36 benchmark functions as well as 3 engineering problems are compared with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO). The result proves the superior effectiveness and robustness of ESOA. ESOA acquires the winner in all unimodal functions and reaches statistic scores all above 9.9, while the scores are better in complex functions as 10.96 and 11.92.",

        "Abstract": "To investigate the clinical characteristics, survival, prognostic factors, and treatment of brain metastasis (BM) from colorectal cancer (CRC). Twenty-one patients with BM from CRC were retrospectively reviewed. Predictive factors for BM and prognostic factors after the diagnosis of BM were examined by univariate and multivariate COX analysis. The time from the development of extracranial metastases, including lung, bone, and liver, to the occurrence of BM was recorded separately. The median overall survival time was 7 months. In univariate prognostic analysis, median survival with multimodal therapy was better than that with unimodal therapy (10 months vs 3 months, P\u2005=\u2005.000). In addition, median survival with Karnofsky performance status (KPS)\u2005<\u200570, 1 BM lesion, primary tumor stage of II-III, extracranial lesions\u2005<\u20052, and no extracranial metastasis were much better than the other groups (P\u2005<\u2005.05 of all). Although there was not a significant difference in median survival between patients receiving combination treatment with bevacizumab and those who did not, treatment with bevacizumab was associated with better survival (10 months vs 5 months, P\u2005=\u2005.436). The time intervals from bone, liver, and lung metastases to BM were 3, 6.5, and 11 months, respectively. Based on multivariate Cox analysis, KPS and treatment modalities were independent prognosis factors (P\u2005=\u2005.039 and P\u2005=\u2005.000, respectively). CRC patients with a high KPS and multimodal treatment have improved survival.",

        "Abstract": "Cuproptosis is a novel form of cell death, correlated with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. However, the metabolic features and the benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy based on cuproptosis have not yet been elucidated in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). First, we identified and validated three cuproptosis subtypes based on 10 cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in HCC patients. We explored the correlation between three cuproptosis subtypes and metabolism-related pathways. Besides, a comprehensive immune analysis of three cuproptosis subtypes was performed. Then, we calculated the cuproptosis-related gene prognostic index (CRGPI) score for predicting prognosis and validated its predictive capability by Decision curve analysis (DCA). We as well explored the benefit of ICI therapy of different CRGPI subgroups in two anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy cohorts (IMvigor210 cohort and GSE176307). Finally, we performed the ridge regression algorithm to calculate the IC50 value for drug sensitivity and Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) analysis to explore the potential mechanism. We found that cluster A presented a higher expression of FDX1 and was correlated with metabolism, glycolysis, and TCA cycle pathways, compared with the other two clusters. HCC patients with high CRGPI scores had a worse OS probability, and we further found that the CRGPI-high group had high expression of PD1/PDL1, TMB, and better response (PR/CR) to immunotherapy in the IMvigor210 cohort and GSE176307. These findings highlight the importance of CRGPI serving as a potential biomarker for both prognostic and immunotherapy for HCC patients. Generally, our results provide novel insights about cuproptosis into immune therapeutic strategies.",

        "Abstract": "The emerging optical multiplexing within nanoscale shows super-capacity in encoding information by using lifetime fingerprints from luminescent nanoparticles. However, the optical diffraction limit compromises the decoding accuracy and throughput of the nanoparticles during conventional widefield imaging. This, in turn, challenges the quality of nanoparticles to afford the modulated excitation condition and further retain the multiplexed optical fingerprints for super-resolution multiplexing. Here we report a tailor-made multiplexed super-resolution imaging method using the lifetime-engineered upconversion nanoparticles. We demonstrate that the nanoparticles are bright, uniform, and stable under structured illumination, which supports a lateral resolution of 185 nm, less than 1/4th of the excitation wavelength. We further develop a deep learning algorithm to coordinate with super-resolution images for more accurate decoding compared to a numeric algorithm. We demonstrate a three-channel super-resolution imaging based optical multiplexing with decoding accuracies above 93% for each channel and larger than 60% accuracy for potential seven-channel multiplexing. The improved resolution provides high throughput by resolving the particles within the diffraction-limited spots, which enables higher multiplexing capacity in space. This lifetime multiplexing super-resolution method opens a new horizon for handling the growing amount of information content, disease source, and security risk in modern society.",

Our findings may provide a scientific basis for promoting the mental health of college students. Students in a medical college were selected using grade-stratified cluster sampling, and administered a standardized questionnaire survey. Out of 2,000 participants, 1827 participants provided valid questionnaires (response rate: 91.4%). The mean scores of life satisfaction and life events were 181.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030.28 and 19.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.62, respectively. The mean score of coping style was 14.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.54, which reflected positive coping style. Analysis of life satisfaction, life events, and factor scores showed that different grades, sibling status (whether the respondent was the only child in the family or not), family location, and life events had a significant association with life satisfaction (",

        "Abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising cancer treatment modality with advantages of minimal invasiveness, repeatable therapy, and mild systemic toxicity. However, the limited bioavailability of photosensitizer (PS), tumor hypoxia, and the presence of antiapoptotic proteins in cancer cells, has hampered the efficiency of PDT. To address these limitations, herein, we developed a hyaluronic acid (HA) based nanosystem (HA-Ce6-Hemin@DNA-Protamine NPs, HCH@DP) loaded with chlorin e6 (Ce6, as PS), hemin (as mimetic catalase) and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) anti-apoptosis protein via a simple electrostatic self-assembly method for enhanced PDT of hypoxic solid tumors. The HCH@DP can target deliver the PS and ASO to tumor cells via cancer cell overexpressed HA receptors (i.e., CD44 or RHAMM). The Ce6 was released from HA-ss-Ce6 (HSC conjugates) after the reaction of cleavable disulfide bond with glutathione (GSH), which recovered the fluorescence and phototoxicity of Ce6 upon laser irradiation. Meanwhile, the catalase-mimicking hemin (degradation of HA-eda-hemin by hyaluronidase) decomposed the tumor overdressed endogenous H",

        "Abstract": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive optical neuroimaging technique, has demonstrated its great potential in monitoring cerebral activity as an alternative to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in research and clinical usage. fNIRS has seen increasing applications in studying the auditory cortex in healthy subjects and cochlear implant users. However, fNIRS is susceptible to motion artifacts, especially those related to jaw movement, which can affect fNIRS signals in speech and auditory tasks. This study aimed to investigate the motion artifacts related to jaw movements including clenching, speaking, swallowing, and sniffing in a group of human subjects, and test whether our previously established denoising algorithm namely PCA-GLM can reduce the motion artifacts. Our results have shown that the jaw movements introduced artifacts that resemble task-evoked activations and that the PCA-GLM method effectively reduced the motion artifacts due to the clenching movements. The preliminary results of the present study underline the importance of the removal of the jaw-movement-related artifacts in fNIRS signals and suggest the efficacy of our PCA-GLM method in reducing the motion artifacts. Clinical Relevance- This work studies the motion artifacts due to jaw movements that frequently occur in speech perception and production tasks and validates the efficacy of an established denoising algorithm which benefits fNIRS studies on auditory and language functions.",

        "Abstract": "It is well known the capacity of potassium ferrate (Fe(VI)) for the oxidation of pollutants or co-precipitation and adsorption of hazardous species. However, little information has been paid on the adsorption and co-precipitation contribution of the Fe(VI) resultant nanoparticles, the in situ hydrolytic ferric iron oxides. Here, the removal of arsenate (As(V)) and arsenite (As(III)) by Fe(VI) was investigated, which focused on the interaction mechanisms of Fe(VI) with arsenic, especially in the contribution of the co-precipitation and adsorption of its hydrolytic ferric iron oxides. pH and Fe(VI) played significant roles on arsenic removal; over 97.8% and 98.1% of As(V) and As(III) removal were observed when Fe(VI):As(V) and Fe(VI):As(III) were 24:1 and 16:1 at pH 4, respectively. The removal of As(V) and As(III) by in situ and ex situ formed hydrolytic ferric iron oxides was examined respectively. The results revealed that As(III) was oxidized by Fe(VI) to As(V), and then was removed though co-precipitation and adsorption by the hydrolytic ferric iron oxides with the contribution content was about 1:3. For As(V), it could be removed directly by the in situ formed particles from Fe(VI) through co-precipitation and adsorption with the contribution content was about 1:1.5. By comparison, As(III) and As(V) were mainly removed through adsorption by the 30-min hydrolytic ferric iron oxides during the ex situ process. The hydrolytic ferric iron oxides size was obviously different in the process of in situ and ex situ, possessing abundant and multiple morphological structures ferric oxides, which was conducive for the efficient removal of arsenic. This study would provide a new perspective for understanding the potential of Fe(VI) treatment on arsenic control.",

Protein lysine methyltransferase (PKMTs) mainly catalyzes the lysine methylation of various core histones and a few non-histone proteins. It has been observed that aberrant activity of PKMTs has been found in many cancers and other diseases, and some PKMT inhibitors have been discovered and progressed to clinical trials. This field developed rapidly and has aroused great interest. In this paper, we reviewed the biochemical and biological activities of PKMTs and their association with various cancers. Selective small-molecule inhibitors, including their chemical structure, structure-activity relationship, and in vitro/vivo studies, are also described to provide ideas for the discovery of highly potent, selective PKMT inhibitors.",

        "Abstract": "Single-beam super-resolution microscopy, also known as superlinear microscopy, exploits the nonlinear response of fluorescent probes in confocal microscopy. The technique requires no complex purpose-built system, light field modulation, or beam shaping. Here, we present a strategy to enhance this technique's spatial resolution by modulating excitation intensity during image acquisition. This modulation induces dynamic optical nonlinearity in upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), resulting in variations of nonlinear fluorescence response in the obtained images. The higher orders of fluorescence response can be extracted with a proposed weighted finite difference imaging algorithm from raw fluorescence images to generate an image with higher resolution than superlinear microscopy images. We apply this approach to resolve single nanoparticles in a large area, improving the resolution to 132 nm. This work suggests a new scope for the development of dynamic nonlinear fluorescent probes in super-resolution nanoscopy.",

        "Abstract": "Most prostate cancers initially respond to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). With the long-term application of ADT, localized prostate cancer will progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), and the transcriptional network shifted. Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) may play a key role in this process through multiple mechanisms. To better understand the role of FOXA1 in prostate cancer, we review the interplay among FOXA1-targeted genes, modulators of FOXA1, and FOXA1 with a particular emphasis on androgen receptor (AR) function. Furthermore, we discuss the distinct role of FOXA1 mutations in prostate cancer and clinical significance of FOXA1. We summarize possible regulation pathways of FOXA1 in different stages of prostate cancer. We focus on links between FOXA1 and AR, which may play different roles in various types of prostate cancer. Finally, we discuss FOXA1 mutation and its clinical significance in prostate cancer. FOXA1 regulates the development of prostate cancer through various pathways, and it could be a biomarker for mCRPC and NEPC. Future efforts need to focus on mechanisms underlying mutation of FOXA1 in advanced prostate cancer. We believe that FOXA1 would be a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in prostate cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Light scattering from nanoparticles is significant in nanoscale imaging, photon confinement. and biosensing. However, engineering the scattering spectrum, traditionally by modifying the geometric feature of particles, requires synthesis and fabrication with nanometre accuracy. Here it is reported that doping lanthanide ions can engineer the scattering properties of low-refractive-index nanoparticles. When the excitation wavelength matches the ion resonance frequency of lanthanide ions, the polarizability and the resulted scattering cross-section of nanoparticles are dramatically enhanced. It is demonstrated that these purposely engineered nanoparticles can be used for interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy. Conceptually, a dual-modality iSCAT microscopy is further developed to identify different nanoparticle types in living HeLa cells. The work provides insight into engineering the scattering features by doping elements in nanomaterials, further inspiring exploration of the geometry-independent scattering modulation strategy.",

        "Title": "Transient brain-wide coactivations and structured transitions revealed in hemodynamic imaging data.",
        "Abstract": "Brain-wide patterns in resting human brains, as either structured functional connectivity (FC) or recurring brain states, have been widely studied in the neuroimaging literature. In particular, resting-state FCs estimated over windowed timeframe neuroimaging data from sub-minutes to minutes using correlation or blind source separation techniques have reported many brain-wide patterns of significant behavioral and disease correlates. The present pilot study utilized a novel whole-head cap-based high-density diffuse optical tomography (DOT) technology, together with data-driven analysis methods, to investigate recurring transient brain-wide patterns in spontaneous fluctuations of hemodynamic signals at the resolution of single timeframes from thirteen healthy adults in resting conditions. Our results report that a small number, i.e., six, of brain-wide coactivation patterns (CAPs) describe major spatiotemporal dynamics of spontaneous hemodynamic signals recorded by DOT. These CAPs represent recurring brain states, showing spatial topographies of hemispheric symmetry, and exhibit highly anticorrelated pairs. Moreover, a structured transition pattern among the six brain states is identified, where two CAPs with anterior-posterior spatial patterns are significantly involved in transitions among all brain states. Our results further elucidate two brain states of global positive and negative patterns, indicating transient neuronal coactivations and co-deactivations, respectively, over the entire cortex. We demonstrate that these two brain states are responsible for the generation of a subset of peaks and troughs in global signals (GS), supporting the recent reports on neuronal relevance of hemodynamic GS. Collectively, our results suggest that transient neuronal events (i.e., CAPs), global brain activity, and brain-wide structured transitions co-exist in humans and these phenomena are closely related, which extend the observations of similar neuronal events recently reported in animal hemodynamic data. Future studies on the quantitative relationship among these transient events and their relationships to windowed FCs along with larger sample size are needed to understand their changes with behaviors and diseased conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Human brains experience whole-brain anatomic and functional changes throughout the lifespan. Age-related whole-brain network changes have been studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine their low-frequency spatial and temporal characteristics. However, little is known about age-related changes in whole-brain fast dynamics at the scale of neuronal events. The present study investigated age-related whole-brain dynamics in resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 73 healthy participants from 6 to 65\u00a0years old via characterizing transient neuronal coactivations at a resolution of tens of milliseconds. These uncovered transient patterns suggest fluctuating brain states at different energy levels of global activations. Our results indicate that with increasing age, shorter lifetimes and more occurrences were observed in the brain states that show the global high activations and more consecutive visits to the global highest-activation brain state. There were also reduced transitional steps during consecutive visits to the global lowest-activation brain state. These age-related effects suggest reduced stability and increased fluctuations when visiting high-energy brain states and with a bias toward staying low-energy brain states. These age-related whole-brain dynamics changes are further supported by changes observed in classic alpha and beta power, suggesting its promising applications in examining the effect of normal healthy brain aging, brain development, and brain disease.",

        "Abstract": "Spontaneous neural activity in human as assessed with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) exhibits brain-wide coordinated patterns in the frequency of \u00a0<\u00a00.1\u00a0Hz. However, understanding of fast brain-wide networks at the timescales of neuronal events (milliseconds to sub-seconds) and their spatial, spectral, and transitional characteristics remain limited due to the temporal constraints of hemodynamic signals. With milli-second resolution and whole-head coverage, scalp-based electroencephalography (EEG) provides a unique window into brain-wide networks with neuronal-timescale dynamics, shedding light on the organizing principles of brain functions. Using the state-of-the-art signal processing techniques, we reconstructed cortical neural tomography from resting-state EEG and extracted component-based co-activation patterns (cCAPs). These cCAPs revealed brain-wide intrinsic networks and their dynamics, indicating the configuration/reconfiguration of resting human brains into recurring and transitional functional states, which are featured with the prominent spatial phenomena of global patterns and anti-state pairs of co-(de)activations. Rich oscillational structures across a wide frequency band (i.e., 0.6\u00a0Hz, 5\u00a0Hz, and 10\u00a0Hz) were embedded in the nonstationary dynamics of these functional states. We further identified a superstructure that regulated between-state immediate and long-range transitions involving the entire set of identified cCAPs and governed a significant aspect of brain-wide network dynamics. These findings demonstrated how resting-state EEG data can be functionally decomposed using cCAPs to reveal rich dynamic structures of brain-wide human neural activations.",

        "Abstract": "Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a common clinical side effect resulted from the overusing of aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs, such as gentamicin. Oxidative stress is recently evidenced to be an important inducer for SNHL, which is reported to be associated with the knockdown of connexin-43. MiR-106a is recently found as a regulator of connexin-43. The present study aims to investigate whether miR-106a is a vital mediator in the development of SNHL. Firstly, upregulated miR-106a was observed in the peripheral blood sample of SNHL patients. Glucose oxidase (GO) was utilized to induce oxidative injury in isolated rat cochlear marginal cells (MCs), followed by introducing the miR-106a inhibitor. We found that the declined proliferation ability, increased apoptosis, and activated oxidative stress in GO-stimulated MCs were dramatically abolished by the miR-106a inhibitor, accompanied by the upregulation of connexin-43. The targeting correlation between miR-106a and connexin-43 was predicted and confirmed by the dual luciferase gene reporter assay. Furthermore, the regulatory effect of miR-106a inhibitor against the proliferation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in GO-treated MCs were dramatically abolished by the knockdown of connexin-43. Gentamicin was utilized to establish the SNHL model in rats, followed by the treatments of antagomir-106a and antagomir-106a combined with carbenoxolone, an inhibitor of connexin-43. The alleviated pathological state, reduced apoptosis, and ameliorated oxidative stress in cochlea tissues were observed in antagomir-106a treated SNHL rats, which were dramatically reversed by the co-administration of carbenoxolone. Collectively, miR-106a facilitated the SNHL induced by oxidative stress via targeting connexin-43.",

This paper systematically combs the internal mechanism of the impact of green credit on high-quality sustainable development of banks and studies the relationship between green credit and high-quality sustainable development of banks by using unbalanced panel data of Chinese listed banks from 2007 to 2019. The results show that green credit will significantly promote high-quality sustainable development of banks, which remains valid after controlling for relevant variables and robustness test. The further test results show that the impact of green credit on high-quality sustainable development of banks will be affected by green environment supervision and monetary policy. Green environment supervision and loose monetary policy promote the positive impact of green credit on high-quality sustainable development of banks. The heterogeneity test results show that the impact of green credit on high-quality sustainable development of banks is significantly different among banks with different business scope and different size, and the positive impact of green credit on high-quality sustainable development of small-scale banks and regional banks is more significant. This paper enriches the research of the impact of green credit on banks.",

        "Abstract": "Zinc is an essential micronutrient for plant growth and development, and functions as a cofactor for hundreds of transcription factors and enzymes in numerous biological processes. Zinc deficiency is common abiotic stress resulting in yield loss and quality deterioration of crops, but zinc excess causes toxicity for biological systems. In plants, zinc homeostasis is tightly modulated by zinc transporters and binding compounds that uptake/release, transport, localize, and store zinc, as well as their upstream regulators. Lazarus 1 (LAZ1), a member of DUF300 protein family, functions as transmembrane organic solute transporter in vertebrates. However, the function of LAZ1 in plants is still obscure. In the present study, the ZmLAZ1-4 protein was confirmed to bind to zinc ions by bioinformatic prediction and thermal shift assay. Heterologous expression of ",

        "Title": "Structural insights into Ras regulation by SIN1.",
        "Abstract": "Over the years it has been established that SIN1, a key component of mTORC2, could interact with Ras family small GTPases through its Ras-binding domain (RBD). The physical association of Ras and SIN1/mTORC2 could potentially affect both mTORC2 and Ras-ERK pathways. To decipher the precise molecular mechanism of this interaction, we determined the high-resolution structures of HRas/KRas-SIN1 RBD complexes, showing the detailed interaction interface. Mutation of critical interface residues abolished Ras-SIN1 interaction and in SIN1 knockout cells we demonstrated that Ras-SIN1 association promotes SGK1 activity but inhibits insulin-induced ERK activation. With structural comparison and competition fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays we showed that HRas-SIN1 RBD association is much weaker than HRas-Raf1 RBD but is slightly stronger than HRas-PI3K RBD interaction, providing a possible explanation for the different outcome of insulin or EGF stimulation. We also found that SIN1 isoform lacking the PH domain binds stronger to Ras than other longer isoforms and the PH domain appears to have an inhibitory effect on Ras-SIN1 binding. In addition, we uncovered a Ras dimerization interface that could be critical for Ras oligomerization. Our results advance our understanding of Ras-SIN1 association and crosstalk between growth factor-stimulated pathways.",

We aimed to compare the feasibility, efficacy and safety of the panoramic view guided approach for ablation of AVNRT with the conventional approach. (2) Methods: Ablation distributions in eight patients were retrospectively analyzed using the panoramic view. The para-slow-pathway (para-SP) region was divided into three regions, and the region that most frequently appeared with the appropriate junctional rhythm or eliminated the slow-pathway was defined as the adaptive slow-pathway (aSP) region. Twenty patients with AVNRT were then ablated in the aSP region under the panoramic view and compared with 40 patients using the conventional approach. (3) Results: Thirty ablation points were analyzed. The majority of effective points (95.0%) were located in the inferior and anterior portions of the para-SP region and defined as the aSP region. Baseline characteristics, fluoroscopic duration, and mean number of ablations were similar among the two groups. The panoramic view group had a significantly higher percentage of appropriate junctional rhythm (81.9% \u00b1 26.0% vs. 55.7% \u00b1 30.5%, ",

        "Abstract": "Recently, molecules with aggregation-induced luminescence (AIE) characteristics have received more and more attention due to the fluorescence of traditional dyes being easily quenched in the aggregated state. AIE molecules have significant advantages, such as excellent light stability, bright fluorescence, high contrast, and large Stokes shift. These characteristics have aroused wide interest of researchers and opened up new applications in many fields, especially in the field of biological applications. However, AIE molecules or their aggregates have certain limitations in multifunctional biological research due to their low specific targeting ability, poor biocompatibility, and poor stability in physiological body fluids. In order to overcome these problems, a novel nanoparticle, FFM1, was fabricated and characterized. FFM1 displayed good water solubility, biocompatibility, and AIE emission properties. It could target HeLa cells specifically by recognizing their folate receptor. Reactive oxygen triggered by light irradiation induced tumor cell apoptosis. Summarily, FFM1 displayed excellent capacity in target imaging and photodynamic killing of HeLa cells. It has shown potential application value in targeted diagnosis and photodynamic therapy of tumors, and has important guiding significance for the treatment of malignant tumors. It paves a way for the development of a novel strategy for tumor theranostics.",

        "Abstract": "Distinguishing bipolar depression (BD) from unipolar depression (UD) based on symptoms only is challenging. Brain functional connectivity (FC), especially dynamic FC, has emerged as a promising approach to identify possible imaging markers for differentiating BD from UD. However, most of such studies utilized conventional FC and group-level statistical comparisons, which may not be sensitive enough to quantify subtle changes in the FC dynamics between BD and UD. In this paper, we present a more effective individualized differentiation model based on machine learning and the whole-brain \"high-order functional connectivity (HOFC)\" network. The HOFC, capturing temporal synchronization among the dynamic FC time series, a more complex \"chronnectome\" metric compared to the conventional FC, was used to classify 52 BD, 73 UD, and 76 healthycontrols (HC). We achieved a satisfactory accuracy (70.40%) in BD vs. UD differentiation. The resultant contributing features revealed the involvement of the coordinated flexible interactions among sensory (e.g., olfaction, vision, and audition), motor, and cognitive systems. Despite sharing common chronnectome of cognitive and affective impairments, BD and UD also demonstrated unique dynamic FC synchronization patterns. UD is more associated with abnormal visual-somatomotor inter-network connections, while BD is more related to impaired ventral attention-frontoparietal inter-network connections. Moreover, we found that the illness duration modulated the BD vs. UD separation, with the differentiation performance hampered by the secondary disease effects. Our findings suggest that BD and UD may have divergent and convergent neural substrates, which further expand our knowledge of the two different mental disorders.",

Here, we found that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) temporally transition to depend on thrombopoietin (TPO), a key extrinsic factor, from E16.5 onward in the developing liver. Deletion of ",

        "Abstract": "Despite progress toward gender equality in the labor market over the past few decades, gender segregation in labor force composition and labor market outcomes persists. Evidence has shown that job advertisements may express gender preferences, which may selectively attract potential job candidates to apply for a given post and thus reinforce gendered labor force composition and outcomes. Removing gender-explicit words from job advertisements does not fully solve the problem as certain implicit traits are more closely associated with men, such as ",

        "Abstract": "Arsenic and antimony are common toxic metalloids found in associated minerals. These metalloids generally cause high-concentration pollution in non-ferrous metal smelting soils; however, few studies have investigated the pollution characteristics of these two metalloids at non-ferrous smelting sites using varying soil particle sizes. In this study, the valency distributions and geochemical fractions were investigated with varying soil particle sizes (\u2264 0.05, 0.05-0.25, 0.25-1, and 1-2\u00a0mm). Soils were mainly concentrated in \u2264\u00a00.05 and 0.05-0.25\u00a0mm with mass percentages of 32.97% and 29.02%, respectively. The highest total As and Sb concentrations in \u2264\u00a00.05\u00a0mm were found to be 20,350 and 3655\u00a0mg/kg, respectively. In addition, As(\u2162), As(\u2164), Sb(\u2162), and Sb(\u2164) concentrations in this soil particle size were found to be 224, 19,813, 1036, and 24\u00a0mg/kg, respectively. The geochemical fractions of As and Sb in varying soil particle sizes were mainly residual, accounting for 50% and 90% in the \u2264\u00a00.05\u00a0mm. Soil may bind \u2264\u00a00.25\u00a0mm due to the disparity found in the geochemical compositions and valency distributions of arsenic and antimony. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive system analysis confirmed that arsenolite accumulated in particle sizes of \u2264\u00a00.05 and 0.05-0.25\u00a0mm. The results of this study may provide a scientific reference for risk assessment and restoration strategies for non-ferrous metal smelting soils.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have emphasized the changes in large-scale brain networks related to healthy aging, with the ultimate purpose to aid in differentiating normal neurocognitive aging from neurodegenerative disorders that also arise with age. Emerging evidence from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) indicates that connectivity patterns within specific brain networks, especially the Default Mode Network (DMN), distinguish those with Alzheimer's disease from healthy individuals. In addition, disruptive alterations in the large-scale brain systems that support high-level cognition are shown to accompany cognitive decline at the behavioral level, which is commonly observed in the aging populations, even in the absence of disease. Although fMRI is useful for assessing functional changes in brain networks, its high costs and limited accessibility discourage studies that need large populations. In this study, we investigated the aging-effect on large-scale networks of the human brain using high-density electroencephalography and electrophysiological source imaging, which is a less costly and more accessible alternative to fMRI. In particular, our study examined a group of healthy subjects in the age range from middle- to older-aged adults, which is an under-studied range in the literature. Employing a high-resolution computation model, our results revealed age associations in the connectivity pattern of DMN in a consistent manner with previous fMRI findings. Particularly, in combination with a standard battery of cognitive tests, our data showed that in the posterior cingulate / precuneus area of DMN higher brain connectivity was associated with lower performance on an episodic memory task. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of using electrophysiological imaging to characterize large-scale brain networks and suggest that changes in network connectivity are associated with normal aging.",

        "Abstract": "Nanocomposites with novel architectures and multifunctional properties have attracted extensive attention among related researchers. Herein, we develop a magnetically responsive Ni/CuNi nanoparticle (NP) decoration of Cu-based composites that could serve as recoverable nanocatalysts for nitroaromatics reduction. The nanocatalysts consist of an inner copper core and abundant tiny satellite Ni/CuNi NPs, which are tightly combined as a stable whole part by a silica interlayer and a carbon outer layer. In addition to the high catalytic activity, the outer Ni/CuNi NPs exhibit a strong magnetic response toward the external magnetic field, thereby offering a convenient way to separate the composites from the reaction solution. Moreover, characterization results reveal that high annealing temperature (above 700 \u00b0C) favors the construction of yolk-shell nanostructures and the formation of outer bimetallic CuNi NPs. As a result, owing to the excellent catalytic performance of the Cu inner cores, the high coverage of outer Ni or CuNi NPs, and the unique sandwich-like structure, the resultant Cu@SiO",

        "Title": "Exploring the potential role of environmental and multi-source satellite data in crop yield prediction across Northeast China.",
        "Abstract": "Developing an accurate crop yield predicting system at a large scale is of paramount importance for agricultural resource management and global food security. Earth observation provides a unique source of information to monitor crops from a diversity of spectral ranges. However, the integrated use of these data and their values in crop yield prediction is still understudied. Here we proposed the combination of environmental data (climate, soil, geography, and topography) with multiple satellite data (optical-based vegetation indices, solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature (LST), and microwave vegetation optical depth (VOD)) into the framework to estimate crop yield for maize, rice, and soybean in northeast China, and their unique value and relative influence on yield prediction was assessed. Two linear regression methods, three machine learning (ML) methods, and one ML ensemble model were adopted to build yield prediction models. Results showed that the individual ML methods outperformed the linear regression methods, the ML ensemble model further improved the single ML models. Moreover, models with more inputs achieved better performance, the combination of satellite data with environmental data, which explained 72%, 69%, and 57% of maize, rice, and soybean yield variability, respectively, demonstrated higher yield prediction performance than individual inputs. While satellite data contributed to crop yield prediction mainly at the early-peak of the growing season, climate data offered extra information mainly at the peak-late season. We also found that the combined use of EVI, LST and SIF has improved the model accuracy compared to the benchmark EVI model. However, the optical-based vegetation indices shared similar information and did not provide much extra information beyond EVI. The within-season yield forecasting showed that crop yields can be satisfactorily forecasted at two to three months prior to harvest. Geography, topography, VOD, EVI, soil hydraulic and nutrient parameters are more important for crop yield prediction.",

        "Abstract": "Under the background of the strategy of reducing pesticide application and increasing efficiency, the mechanism and common technology of efficient and accurate target deposition of chemical pesticides are the key development direction. The interaction between pesticide droplets and a leaf surface affects the deposition behavior of pesticides. However, cucumber leaf surface modified by powdery mildew pathogens at different growth stages is more hydrophobic than a normal leaf surface, which hinders the accurate deposition of pesticides on cucumber powdery mildew leaves. Here, an effective strategy for controlling pesticide efficiency for the entire journey of pesticide application is proposed. Based on the impact dynamics of droplets, the dynamic direction of droplet bounce is determined, the trajectory of droplet rebound is preliminarily determined, and the pinning sites formed by droplets on the surface of cucumber leaves with powdery mildew are confirmed. By analyzing the dynamics in the retraction stage and the energy dissipation rate for droplets after impact, the basic parameters that can be used to simply characterize droplet rebound are screened out, and the effect of addition of an effective surfactant is determined by characterizing the basic parameters (energy dissipation rate, retraction rate, recovery coefficient). The molecular structure formed by the addition of nonionic surfactant in pesticide solution is more appropriate to the interaction between the powdery mildew layer and the pesticide solution, which ensured that the droplets are well wet and deposited on cucumber powdery mildew leaves. Meanwhile, a force balance model for the pesticide droplet wetting state is established to calculate the pinning force for the droplet and predict the transition direction for the droplet wetting state. Impact dynamics combined with force balance model analysis provides a constructive method to improve pesticide utilization during the entire journey for pesticide application on hydrophobic plant surfaces.",

        "Abstract": "Building extraction in VHR RSIs remains a challenging task due to occlusion and boundary ambiguity problems. Although conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based methods are capable of exploiting local texture and context information, they fail to capture the shape patterns of buildings, which is a necessary constraint in the human recognition. To address this issue, we propose an adversarial shape learning network (ASLNet) to model the building shape patterns that improve the accuracy of building segmentation. In the proposed ASLNet, we introduce the adversarial learning strategy to explicitly model the shape constraints, as well as a CNN shape regularizer to strengthen the embedding of shape features. To assess the geometric accuracy of building segmentation results, we introduced several object-based quality assessment metrics. Experiments on two open benchmark datasets show that the proposed ASLNet improves both the pixel-based accuracy and the object-based quality measurements by a large margin.

        "Abstract": "Diffuse optical tomography (DOT), based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy, is a portable, low-cost, noninvasive functional neuroimaging technology for studying the human brain in normal and diseased conditions. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the performance of a cap-based brain-wide DOT (BW-DOT) framework in mapping brain-wide networked activities. We first analyzed point-spread-function (PSF)-based metrics on a realistic head geometry. Our simulation results indicated that these metrics of the optode cap varied across the brain and were of lower quality in brain areas deep or away from the optodes. We further reconstructed brain-wide resting-state networks using experimental data from healthy participants, which resembled the template networks established in the fMRI literature. The preliminary results of the present study highlight the importance of evaluating PSF-based metrics on realistic head geometries for DOT and suggest that BW-DOT technology is a promising functional neuroimaging tool for studying brain-wide neural activities and large-scale neural networks, which was not available by patch-based DOT. A full-scope evaluation and validation in more realistic head models and more participants are needed in the future to establish the findings of the present study further.Clinical relevance- Via simulations and experimental evaluation, this work establishes a novel framework to image large-scale brain networks, which benefits the patient population, such as bedridden patients, infants, etc., who otherwise cannot undergo conventional brain monitoring modalities like fMRI and PET.",

The electron-rich active sites can promote the adsorption of hydrogen, which accelerates the Volmer step and thereby enhances the electrocatalytic performance of HER. Here, we found that the strong interfacial interaction between TiO nanodots (TiO/Co-S) and Co-S nanosheets could advantageously improve the performance toward HER of electrocatalyst. Meanwhile, XPS results showed that modulating the local electronic structure of the TiO nanodots produces electron-rich regions on Co.

        "Abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) and colon cancer (CRC) are the two most deadly cancers in the world. These cancers partly share the same genetic background and are partially regulated by the same genes. The outcomes of traditional chemoradiotherapy and surgery remain suboptimal, with high postoperative recurrence and a low survival rate. It is, therefore, urgent to innovate and improve the existing treatment measures. Many studies primarily reported that the microRNA (miRNA) sponge functions of circular RNA (circRNA) in BC and CRC have an indirect relationship between the circRNA-miRNA axis and malignant behaviors. With a covalent ring structure, circRNAs can regulate the expression of target genes in multiple ways, especially by acting as miRNA sponges. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on the roles of circRNAs as miRNA sponges in BC and CRC based on studies over the last three years, thus providing a theoretical reference for finding new therapeutic targets in the future.",

        "Abstract": "In order to effectively analyze and explore the socio-economic impact of haze pollution, the article constructs a comprehensive two-stage decomposition model to verify that technological progress plays a key role in controlling haze pollution. And for the first time, a macro-level research framework for the rebound effect of haze pollution has been constructed to compare and analyze the heterogeneity of the rebound effect of technological progress in different industries in different regions. The study found that (1) during the period 2000-2017, haze pollution situation deteriorated. Economic effects were the main reasons for haze pollution. Among these effects, technological progress was the main driving force for haze control, followed by the emission intensity during 2000-2011 and the reduction of industrial structure since 2014. (2) The significant drive of emission reduction is in the secondary industry, showing a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. Besides, there was a difference in spatial distribution, which shows an increased trend from east to west. (3) The rebound effect of haze pollution at the macro level in China presented high-level fluctuations, and there were certain spatial distribution differences. However, due to the convergence of technological development stages, regional differences have a gradual convergence trend. In the future, in the process of haze control, it is necessary to increase support for technological innovation, implement energy total control and price reform, promote technological progress, and implement differentiated haze reduction policies to solve problems according to local conditions.",

        "Abstract": "The hypoxia-activated and nitroreductase-responsive phototheranostic probe has been developed by incorporating a nitro group into a hemicyanine fluorophore. The probe displays extremely sensitive and selective near-infrared fluorescence enhancement to nitroreductase with the detection limit of 2.10\u00a0ng/mL. The detection mechanism relies on the nitroreductase-catalyzed reduction of the nitro group to an amino group, along with the generation of the fluorophore. The availability of the probe in fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy was demonstrated at cellular level and in vivo. The probe can image endogenous nitroreductase and the hypoxia status of living cells. The probe also exhibits significant phototoxicity to hypoxia tumor cells under the 660\u00a0nm laser irradiation. More importantly, the probe has been successfully utilized in imaging tiny tumor (about 6\u00a0mm",

        "Title": "lncRNA MELTF-AS1 facilitates osteosarcoma metastasis by modulating MMP14 expression.",
        "Abstract": "Osteosarcoma is a highly aggressive cancer common in children and adolescents. There is still a lack of effective treatments for metastatic or recurrent osteosarcoma. The role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in osteosarcoma has gradually attracted attention. Here, we identified lncRNAs that were abnormally expressed in metastatic osteosarcoma through analyzing the sequencing data of osteosarcoma tissues and selected upregulated lncRNA MELTF-AS1 for detailed study.\u00a0The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of MELTF-AS1 was increased in osteosarcoma tissues and cells, and the high expression of MELTF-AS1 indicated a poor prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. The high expression of MELTF-AS1 in osteosarcoma was partly due to the transcriptional activation of RREB1. The results of transwell assays, scratch wound healing assays, and the tail vein injection lung metastasis model demonstrated that knocking down MELTF-AS1 inhibited metastasis ability of osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore, the results of RNA pull-down assays, luciferase reporter assays, and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays revealed that MELTF-AS1 could regulate MMP14 expression through interaction with miR-485-5p. Our study suggested that MELTF-AS1 functioned as a pro-metastasis gene in osteosarcoma by upregulating MMP14 and that it could\u00a0be a potential therapeutic and diagnostic target for osteosarcoma.",

        "Abstract": "Hydrophobic surfaces modified by pathogens in agricultural production are one of the main reasons to reduce the utilization of pesticides. Adding surfactants to pesticide solutions is a common method to improve their wetting and spreading properties. In this work, the interaction mechanism between pathogen-modified hydrophobic surfaces and mixtures of surfactants and a pesticide was studied in detail. The interaction mechanism was determined by characterizing the wetting and spreading behaviors of droplets on cucumber powdery mildew leaves at different growth stages. When surfactants were added, droplets on cucumber powdery mildew leaves were in the Wenzel wetting state, the pinning force weakened, the contact line speed accelerated, and the adhesion force increased. We explained the micellar state and aggregation behavior of surfactant molecules in a pesticide solution that was applied to the surface of cucumber powdery mildew leaves. Droplets of solutions containing nonionic surfactants easily formed semibald micelles, binding to the pathogen of powdery mildew, whereas droplets containing cationic surfactants did not do so. Because of the electrostatic interaction between cationic surfactant molecules and powdery mildew pathogens, cationic surfactant molecules did not wet the pathogens very well, so we suggest adding nonionic surfactants rather than cationic surfactants to improve the wetting and spreading of pesticide solutions on cucumber powdery mildew leaves. This study provides new insights into enhancing the wetting and deposition of droplets on pathogen-modified hydrophobic surfaces.",

        "Abstract": "The quality inspection of micro solder joints in laser spot welding (LSW) is a problem of great concern in industrial application. In this paper, a laser ultrasonic technology (LUT) was proposed to inspect the quality of micro solder joints in LSW. Firstly, based on the thermoelastic model of acoustic wave propagation in solid, a theoretical model was built and used to analyze the propagation properties of the Lamb wave in the whole field by finite element method (FEM), the transmitting properties of the excited Lamb wave via solder joint were affected by the effective contacted area of solder joint. Secondly, LUT was used to inspect the 1.2\u202fmm/0.4\u202fmm welding spot of standard/false 304 stainless steel welded components. By comparing the propagating properties of excited ultrasonic wave in different samples with different weld quality, the standard and false welding can be visually distinguished. Finally, a industrial CT was used to check the quality of the samples used in our experiment. Inclusions and pores have been found in the false solder joints, which will reduce the effective contacted area of solder joint, and then affected the propagation of ultrasonic wave. By combining the CT results and the experimental analysis, the experimental results detected by LUT are in good agreement with the simulation results. So, the LUT is a potential method in field of the quality inspection of micro solder joints in LSW.",

        "Abstract": "Stroke, also known as cerebral stroke or cerebrovascular accident, refers to acute ischemic or hemorrhagic encephalopathy caused by a disturbance to cerebral blood flow. Ischemic stroke is the most common type of cerebral stroke, accounting for approximately 80% of the total incidence of clinical stroke. High morbidity, disability, and mortality rates place heavy burdens on the families of patients and society. An increasing number of studies have shown that histone modification plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, but most studies on histone modification focus on acetylation, and studies on the role of histone methylation in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke are limited. Here, we review the role of histone methylation and related histone methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitors in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke and related HMT inhibitors in the treatment of ischemic stroke, which may open up a new avenue to the study of ischemic stroke.",

In this study, we analyzed chlorinated paraffins (CPs) in foodstuff samples (551 pooled samples, 93 items) divided into eight categories collected from Jinan, Shandong Province of China, by atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (APCI-qToF-MS), to investigate the occurrence, contamination patterns and homologue patterns of LCCPs in foodstuff commonly consumed in traditional Chinese diet. LCCP intake through diet was estimated as well. LCCPs were detected in all pooled samples with geometric mean (GM) concentrations ranging from 1.8 to 21.9\u00a0ng/g wet weight (ng/g ww), contributing to 9-28% of the total CP mass in the studied foodstuff categories. The contamination patterns of LCCPs differed from SCCPs and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs), as reflected by the patterns of mass distribution, and by the lack of correlations between LCCP and S/MCCP concentrations in various foodstuff categories. The homologue profiles of LCCPs were extremely complex and diverse, with frequent detection of C",

        "Abstract": "The bone marrow niche plays critical roles in hematopoietic recovery and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regeneration after myeloablative stress. However, it is not clear whether systemic factors beyond the local niche are required for these essential processes in vivo. Thrombopoietin (THPO) is a key cytokine promoting hematopoietic rebound after myeloablation and its transcripts are expressed by multiple cellular sources. The upregulation of bone marrow-derived THPO has been proposed to be crucial for hematopoietic recovery and HSC regeneration after stress. Nonetheless, the cellular source of THPO in myeloablative stress has never been investigated genetically. We assessed the functional sources of THPO following two common myeloablative perturbations: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) administration and irradiation. Using a ",

        "Abstract": "Human gut microbiome research, especially gut microbiome, has been developing at a considerable pace over the last decades, driven by a rapid technological advancement. The emergence of high-throughput technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and others, has afforded the generation of large volumes of data, and in relation to specific pathologies such as different cancer types. The current review identifies high-throughput technologies as they have been implemented in the study of microbiome and cancer. Four main thematic areas have emerged: the characterization of microbial diversity and composition, microbial functional analyses, biomarker prediction, and, lastly, potential therapeutic applications. The majority of studies identified focus on the microbiome diversity characterization, which is reaching technological maturity, while the remaining three thematic areas could be described as emerging.",

        "Abstract": "With the widespread use of PD-1/PD-L1\u00a0monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the treatment of multiple malignant tumors, they were also gradually applied to advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). Nowadays, multiple PD-1/PD-L1\u00a0mAbs, such as nivolumab, avelumab, and pembrolizumab, have achieved considerable efficacy in clinical trials. However, due to the primary, adaptive, and acquired resistance to these mAbs, the efficacy of this immunotherapy is not satisfactory. Theories also vary as to why the difference in efficacy occurs. The alterations of PD-L1 expression and the interference of cellular immunity may affect the efficacy. These mechanisms demand to be revealed to achieve a sustained and complete objective response in patients with aRCC. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been proven to have synergistic mechanisms with PD-1/PD-L1\u00a0mAb in the treatment of aRCC, and CTLA-4\u00a0mAb has been shown to have a non-redundant effect with PD-1/PD-L1\u00a0mAb to enhance efficacy. Although combinations with targeted agents or other checkpoint mAbs have yielded enhanced clinical outcomes in multiple clinical trials nowadays, the potential of PD-1/PD-L1\u00a0mAbs still has a large development space. More potential mechanisms that affect the efficacy demand to be developed and transformed into the clinical treatment of aRCC to search for possible combination regimens. We elucidate these mechanisms in RCC and present existing combination therapies applied in clinical trials. This may help physicians' select treatment options for patients with refractory kidney cancer.",

        "Abstract": "The deposition and retention of pesticide sprays on the surface of hydrophobic plant leaves is a major agricultural challenge, and the deposition of hydrophobic surfaces caused by plant leaf diseases is also a major agricultural problem. Many recent studies have focused on evaluating the effect of adding surfactants to water rather than to pesticide solutions to increase the deposition and retention of spray liquids. Here, we report a strategy to solve the problem of deposition and retention by studying the impact of the behavior of pesticide droplets with added surfactants and performing kinetic analysis on cucumber leaves with powdery mildew. The reduction in the bounce and splash of the pesticide droplets was analyzed by combining the pinning site formed in the retraction stage and the viscous dissipation in the rebound stage. In the practical application of the pesticide spray, we can clearly see that the bounce, splash, and powdery mildew spore ejection decreased when surfactants were added to the pesticide spray that was used on the cucumber leaves, and the adhesion and retention increased. The proposed comprehensive method is helpful for understanding the interactions between pesticide spray droplets and the surface of cucumber leaves with powdery mildew.",

Follicular helper T cells (Tfh cells) play an anti-tumor role in various malignant solid tumors and predict better patient prognosis. In the present study, we aimed to determine the immunosuppressive mechanism associated with Tfh cells and explore a new strategy to improve the tumor microenvironment of PDAC. Flow cytometry was used to detect the infiltration and proportion of Tfh cells in tumor tissues and peripheral blood from patients with PDAC. The spatial correlations of Tfh cells with related immune cells were evaluated using immunofluorescence. The function of Tfh cells was examined using in vitro and in vivo model systems. The high infiltration of Tfh cells predicted better prognosis in patients with PDAC. Tfh cells recruited CD8",

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumour of the digestive tract that is characterized by high patient morbidity and mortality rates. Claudin-7 (Cldn7), a tight junction protein, was recently reported to function as a candidate tumour suppressor gene in CRC. Our previous study demonstrated that the large intestine of C57/BL6 mice showed intestinal adenomas and abnormal Ki67 expression and distribution in the intestinal crypt when Cldn7 was knocked out. The aim of this study was to further investigate whether Cldn7 deficiency has non-tight junction functions, affects intestinal stemness properties, promotes CRC and to determine the specific mechanism.",

As a reflection of BM remodeling, MAT is highly responsive to nutrient fluctuations, hormonal changes, and metabolic disturbances such as obesity and diabetes mellitus. Expansion of MAT has also been strongly associated with bone loss in mice and humans. However, the regulation of BM plasticity remains poorly understood, as does the mechanism that links changes in marrow adiposity with bone remodeling.",

        "Title": "Computational design and synthesis of molecular imprinted polymers for selective solid phase extraction of sulfonylurea herbicides.",
        "Abstract": "A high-efficiency approach for the synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers has been developed and further for the solid-phase extraction of sulfonylurea herbicides in food samples. Molecular simulation approach combined chemometric selected metsulfuron-methyl (MSM) and 2-trifluoromethyl acrylic acid (TFMAA) as the template and the monomer to synthesize the molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). Experimental validation confirmed that the MSM-imprinted polymers showed a higher selectivity and affinity to sulfonylurea herbicides. The optimized molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) conditions, including loading, washing, and eluting conditions, were established. The developed MISPE technology combined HPLC-MSMS was successfully used for the determination of sulfonylurea herbicides in foods. Compared with commercial SPE columns, MISPE showed high affinity, excellent selectivity and low matrix effect. The recoveries of sulfonylurea herbicides spiked in four matrices were between 86.4% and 100.2%, with the relative standard deviations (RSD) in the range of 0.9%-10.5%.",

To elucidate the role of miR-486-5p in the mTOR pathway, we investigated its role in NSCLC and related signaling. Our results confirmed that miR-486-5p was downregulated in most of human NSCLC tissue samples and cell lines. Further study confirmed that it inhibited NSCLC through repression of the mTOR pathway ",

        "Abstract": "Intestinal epithelial barrier protects intestine from infection and injury, while chronic inflammation is a trigger for tumorigenesis. As a member of tight junctions (TJs) family, Claudin-7 (Cldn-7) is dedicated to maintaining cell polarity and TJs barrier integrity, and closely related to the development of inflammation and tumors. However, potential roles of Cldn-7 in intestinal inflammation and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) have not been well characterized in vivo. Here, we analyzed the expression profile of Cldn-7 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and CAC. Colitis and colitis-cancer transformation models were established based on inducible intestinal conditional Cldn-7 gene knockout mice (Cldn7fl/fl;villin-CreERT2), by intraperitoneal injection of azomethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) feeding. Cldn-7 knockout promoted susceptibility to colitis and CAC, aggravated clinical symptoms, severely damaged intestinal epithelium, increased mucosal inflammation accompanied dysregulated cell proliferation-apoptosis. Epithelial barrier integrity was destroyed, and intercellular permeability was increased. After AOM/DSS induction, tumor burden and volume were increased, characterized by enhanced proliferation and activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Mechanistically, Cldn-7 deficiency promoted colitis and subsequently malignant transformation by destroying TJs integrity and increasing inflammatory cascade. Overall, based on Cldn-7 knockout mouse model, we have first demonstrated the key roles of Cldn-7 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and preventing IBD and consequent CAC. ",

        "Abstract": "Exploring cost-effective and efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts via simple fabrication strategies is strongly desired for practical water splitting. Herein, an easy and fast one-step electrodeposition process is developed to fabricate W-doped NiFe (NiFeW)-layered double hydroxides with ultrathin nanosheet features at room temperature and ambient pressure as bifunctional catalysts for water splitting. Notably, the NiFeW nanosheets require overpotentials of only 239 and 115 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm",

        "Abstract": "Mal de d\u00e9barquement syndrome (MdDS) is a motion-induced disorder of oscillating vertigo that persists after the motion has ceased. The neuroimaging characteristics of the MdDS brain state have been investigated with studies on brain metabolism, structure, functional connectivity, and measurements of synchronicity. Baseline metabolism and resting-state functional connectivity studies indicate that a limbic focus in the left entorhinal cortex and amygdala may be important in the pathology of MdDS, as these structures are hypermetabolic in MdDS and exhibit increased functional connectivity to posterior sensory processing areas and reduced connectivity to the frontal and temporal cortices. Both structures are tunable with periodic stimulation, with neurons in the entorhinal cortex required for spatial navigation, acting as a critical efferent pathway to the hippocampus, and sending and receiving projections from much of the neocortex. Voxel-based morphometry measurements have revealed volume differences between MdDS and healthy controls in hubs of multiple resting-state networks including the default mode, salience, and executive control networks. In particular, volume in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortices decreases and volume in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri/anterior insulas increases with longer duration of illness. Paired with noninvasive neuromodulation interventions, functional neuroimaging with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and simultaneous fMRI-EEG have shown changes in resting-state functional connectivity that correlate with symptom modulation, particularly in the posterior default mode network. Reduced parieto-occipital connectivity with the entorhinal cortex and reduced long-range fronto-parieto-occipital connectivity correlate with symptom improvement. Though there is a general theme of desynchronization correlating with reduced MdDS symptoms, the prediction of optimal stimulation parameters for noninvasive brain stimulation in individuals with MdDS remains a challenge due to the large parameter space. However, the pairing of functional neuroimaging and noninvasive brain stimulation can serve as a probe into the biological underpinnings of MdDS and iteratively lead to optimal parameter space identification.",

        "Abstract": "This meta-analysis investigated the comparative efficacy and safety of PARP inhibitor monotherapy as maintenance treatment in platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC). Electronic databases were systematically searched for relevant RCTs. The primary endpoint was PFS. The results were stratified based on three categories: BRCA mutated patients, HRD patients, and overall population. The secondary outcome were discontinuations due to adverse events and grade 3 or 4 adverse events in maintenance phase. Five eligible RCTs were included in the network meta-analysis. For patients with BRCA mutated ovarian cancer, olaparib-throughout (HR = 0.21 with 95% CrI: 0.081-0.55), rucaparib (HR = 0.23 with 95% CrI: 0.16-0.34), olaparib (HR = 0.27 with 95% CrI: 0.20-0.35), and niraparib (HR = 0.26 with 95% CrI: 0.17-0.41) were all highly effective in comparison with placebo at improving PFS. For HRD patients, both rucaparib (HR = 0.32 with 95% CrI: 0.24-0.42) and niraparib (HR = 0.38 with 95% CrI: 0.24-0.60) were all highly effective in comparison with placebo at improving PFS. For the overall population, olaparib-throughout (HR = 0.51 with 95% CrI: 0.34-0.76), rucaparib (HR = 0.37 with 95% CrI: 0.30-0.45), olaparib (HR = 0.35 with 95% CrI: 0.25-0.49), and niraparib (HR = 0.38 with 95% CrI: 0.30-0.48) were all highly effective in comparison with placebo at improving PFS. Regarding grade 3 or 4 adverse events, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity reactions to rucaparib and niraparib were significantly higher than in the olaparib group. In terms of discontinuations due to adverse events, the treatment discontinuations were not significantly different between the three drugs. In summary, all the included maintenance treatment regimens are effective regardless of BRCA mutational status, and no statistically significant differences between rucaparib, niraparib and Olaparib in terms of PFS. In terms of safety profile, the three drugs present manageable adverse events. Clinicians should consider potential adverse events related to each of these interventions in clinical practice, and the adverse events are generally manageable.",

        "Abstract": "Triplet fusion upconversion (also called triplet-triplet annihilation, TTA) arouses much attention due to its potential in the fields of biological imaging, optogenetics, and light harvesting. However, oxygen quenching remains a challenge ahead, restricting its applications in aqueous media. Previous efforts to realize aqueous TTA with oxygen resistance have been focused on core-shell structures and self-assembly, but tedious processes and complicated chemical modification are required. Here, we report a direct and efficient strategy to realize aqueous TTA by controlling the ionic equilibrium of the TTA dyad. We find that the ionized organic dyad in physiological buffers and electrolyte-based media shows a natural aerotolerance without any complicated structure engineering. In particular, the upconversion intensity of this aqueous TTA in Tris buffer under an air-saturated condition is more than twice that under the deaerated condition. We further demonstrate the TTA system for potential applications in pH and temperature sensing with reversible and sensitive performance. We anticipate this facile approach will inspire the development of practical aqueous TTA and broad applications in biological science.",

        "Abstract": "Autophagy modulates lipid turnover, cell survival, inflammation, and atherogenesis. Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) plays a crucial role in lysosome function. Here, we demonstrate that SR-BI regulates autophagy in atherosclerosis. SR-BI deletion attenuated lipid-induced expression of autophagy mediators in macrophages and atherosclerotic aortas. Consequently, SR-BI deletion resulted in 1.8- and 2.5-fold increases in foam cell formation and apoptosis, respectively, and increased oxidized LDL-induced inflammatory cytokine expression. Pharmacological activation of autophagy failed to reduce lipid content or apoptosis in Sr-b1-/- macrophages. SR-BI deletion reduced both basal and inducible levels of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagy, causing decreased expression of autophagy genes encoding VPS34 and Beclin-1. Notably, SR-BI regulated Tfeb expression by enhancing PPAR\u03b1 activation. Moreover, intracellular macrophage SR-BI localized to autophagosomes, where it formed cholesterol domains resulting in enhanced association of Barkor and recruitment of the VPS34-Beclin-1 complex. Thus, SR-BI deficiency led to lower VPS34 activity in macrophages and in atherosclerotic aortic tissues. Overexpression of Tfeb or Vps34 rescued the defective autophagy in Sr-b1-/- macrophages. Taken together, our results show that macrophage SR-BI regulates autophagy via Tfeb expression and recruitment of the VPS34-Beclin-1 complex, thus identifying previously unrecognized roles for SR-BI and potentially novel targets for the treatment of atherosclerosis.",

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one kind of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, owing to its insidious symptoms, early metastases, and negative responses to current therapies. With an increasing understanding of pathology, the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a significant role in ineffective treatment and poor prognosis of PC. Thus, a growing number of studies have focused on whether components of the TME could be effective targets for PC therapy. Biomaterials have been widely applied in cancer therapy, and numerous organic or inorganic biomaterials for TME regulation have been developed to inhibit the growth and metastasis of PC, as well as reverse therapeutic resistance. In this review, we discuss various biomaterials utilized to treat PC based on different components of the TME, including, but not limited to, extracellular matrix (ECM), abnormal tumor vascularization, and tumor-associated immune cells, as well as other unconventional therapeutic strategies. Besides, the perspectives on the underlying future of theranostic nanomedicines for PC therapy are also presented.",

The wetting and deposition behavior of liquid pesticides can be improved by adding surfactants to pesticides. Added surfactants affect the spray volume of the pesticide, which can lead to waste and a low utilization rate of the pesticide. It is important to further balance the relationship between deposition and wettability of pesticide liquid on the surfaces of healthy leaves and powdery mildew leaves of cucumber.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, integration of self-healing, color-tunable, sol-gel converted properties into hydrogel has attracted interest for preparing a reinforced multifunctional hydrogel. Herein, acidochromic regenerated cellulose (ARC) was incorporated into the polyvinyl alcohol/borax (PB) matrix for constructing a tough, self-healing, multicolor and sol-gel converted smart hydrogel (PB/ARC). The mechanical properties of PB/ARC hydrogel were improved after introducing ARC, which could bear a weight of 200 g and had high maximum tensile strength (6.8 times) and compressive strength (2.3 times). PB/ARC hydrogel automatically fused within 15 s after being cut and quickly recovered to the original state after being subjected to high shear strain, showing excellent self-healing ability. The color of hydrogel could be tuned between yellow and purple by altering pH values (5-12). In addition, PB/ARC hydrogel exhibited reversible sol-gel conversion in response to the change of acidity and alkalinity. This study offers a new and facile strategy for developing multifunctional smart hydrogel.",

        "Abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum stress is an important contributor to the cerebral ischemic injury. Sappanone A (SA), a kind of natural homoisoflavanone extracted from Caesalpinia sappan L, has been evidenced to exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. The present study aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of SA in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. The potential neuroprotective effect of SA was tested in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) allowing reperfusion and PC12 cell model of oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R). Post-ischemic neuronal injury was evaluated by 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. The levels of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress-related markers were detected using corresponding kits. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) or flow cytometry, and the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins was determined using western blot analysis. Subsequently, endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins were detected through western blot analysis, and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) was overexpressed to confirm the contribution of endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibition by SA to the neuroprotective effects post OGD/R. Results revealed that SA was effective in ameliorating cerebral infarction and pathological injuries post-reperfusion following MCAO, which is associated with reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis by SA in the brain. Consistently, these neuroprotective effects of SA post ischemia-reperfusion were also observed in a PC12 cell model of OGD/R. Importantly, endoplasmic reticulum stressors, including the CHOP, the 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factors 2\u03b1 (EIF-2\u03b1), were significantly downregulated by SA, while CHOP overexpression attenuated the beneficial effects of SA on inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in OGD/R-induced PC12 cells. These results demonstrated that SA alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress, ameliorating inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, and thereby serves as therapeutic potential for protection against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in ischemic stroke.",

        "Abstract": "Autophagy programs the metabolic and functional fitness of regulatory T (T reg) cells to establish immune tolerance, yet the mechanisms governing autophagy initiation in T reg cells remain unclear. Here, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase ZFP91 facilitates autophagy activation to sustain T reg cell metabolic programming and functional integrity. T reg cell-specific deletion of Zfp91 caused T reg cell dysfunction and exacerbated colonic inflammation and inflammation-driven colon carcinogenesis. TCR-triggered autophagy induction largely relied on T reg cell-derived ZFP91 to restrict hyperglycolysis, which is required for the maintenance of T reg cell homeostasis. Mechanistically, ZFP91 rapidly translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to TCR stimulation and then mediated BECN1 ubiquitination to promote BECN1-PIK3C3 complex formation. Therefore, our results highlight a ZFP91-dependent mechanism promoting TCR-initiated autophagosome maturation to maintain T reg cell homeostasis and function.",

        "Title": "Induction of notochordal differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal\u2011derived stem cells via the stimulation of notochordal cell\u2011rich nucleus pulposus tissue.",
        "Abstract": "The degeneration of intervertebral disc\u00a0(IVD) tissue, initiated following the disappearance of notochordal cells\u00a0(NCs), is characterized by the decreased number of nucleus pulposus\u00a0(NP) cells\u00a0(NPCs) and extracellular matrix. Transplanting proper cells into the IVD may sustain cell numbers, resulting in the synthesis of new matrix; this represents a minimally invasive regenerative therapy. However, the lack of cells with a correct phenotype severely hampers the development of regenerative therapy. The present study aimed to investigate whether porcine NC\u2011rich NP tissue stimulates bone marrow\u2011derived mesenchymal stem cell\u00a0(BM\u2011MSC) differentiation toward NC\u2011like cells, which possess promising regenerative ability, for the treatment of disc degeneration diseases. BM\u2011MSCs were successfully isolated from porcine femurs and tibiae, which expressed CD90 and CD105 markers and did not express CD45. Differentiation induction experiments revealed that the isolated cells had osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential. When co\u2011cultured with NC\u2011rich NP tissue, the BM\u2011MSCs successfully differentiated into NC\u2011like cells. Cell morphological analysis revealed that the cells exhibited an altered morphology, from a shuttle\u2011like to a circular one, and the expression of NC marker genes, including brachyury, keratin\u20118, and keratin\u201118, was enhanced, and the cells exhibited the ability to generate aggrecan and collagen II. Taken together, the findings of the present study demonstrated that the primarily isolated and cultured BM\u2011MSCs may be stimulated to differentiate into NC\u2011like cells by porcine NC\u2011rich NP explants, potentially providing an ideal cell source for regenerative therapies for disc degeneration diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Paucity of the glucose transporter-1 (Glut1) protein resulting from haploinsufficiency of the SLC2A1 gene arrests cerebral angiogenesis and disrupts brain function to cause Glut1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1 DS). Restoring Glut1 to Glut1 DS model mice prevents disease, but the precise cellular sites of action of the transporter, its temporal requirements, and the mechanisms linking scarcity of the protein to brain cell dysfunction remain poorly understood. Here, we show that Glut1 functions in a cell-autonomous manner in the cerebral microvasculature to affect endothelial tip cells and, thus, brain angiogenesis. Moreover, brain endothelial cell-specific Glut1 depletion not only triggers a severe neuroinflammatory response in the Glut1 DS brain, but also reduces levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and causes overt disease. Reduced BDNF correlated with fewer neurons in the Glut1 DS brain. Controlled depletion of the protein demonstrated that brain pathology and disease severity was greatest when Glut1 scarcity was induced neonatally, during brain angiogenesis. Reducing Glut1 at later stages had mild or little effect. Our results suggest that targeting brain endothelial cells during early development is important to ensure proper brain angiogenesis, prevent neuroinflammation, maintain BDNF levels, and preserve neuron numbers. This requirement will be essential for any disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for Glut1 DS.",

        "Abstract": "In this work, modified chitosan flocculants (MCS) was synthesized by using chitosan (CS), acrylamide, cationic monomers and hydrophobic monomers via low-pressure UV-initiated copolymerization. The flocculation performance of MCS was evaluated in emulsified oily wastewater treatment. The effect of cationic and hydrophobic structure on oil removal was studied, and the interactions between these functional groups and the components in oil were also analyzed. Results suggested that MCS flocculants exhibited excellent oil removal efficiency in a wide pH range (2.0\u201210). The flocculation efficiency of 91 % was achieved at the dosages of 0.6 mL/L (6 mg/L). During pH of 2.0-10, the optimal cationic and hydrophobic monomer was DMC and VT, respectively. Silane groups were favorable for oil removal than the other hydrophobic structures. The cationic groups expanded the optimal pH range of MCS in flocculation, whereas hydrophobic groups considerably reduced the dosage of MCS. The experimental results showed that alkane, cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds in oil can be easily removed by using MC4, whereas cycloalkanes compounds was effectively removed by MC6 and MC7 because of preferable demulsification capacity, and the hydrophobic interaction, interfacial adsorption and electrostatic attraction played the dominant in flocculation. Thus, the synthesized MCS is favorable for emulsified oily wastewater treatment.",

        "Abstract": "LLKL, a new traditional Chinese medicine formula containing Edgeworthia gardneri (Wall.) Meisn., Sibiraea angustata and Crocus sativus L. (saffron), was designed to ameliorate type 2 diabetes mellitus. Despite the therapeutic benefits of LLKL, its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study evaluated the LLKL anti-diabetic efficacy and its effect on gut microbiota to elucidate its mechanism of action in Zucker diabetic fatty rats. We found that administration of different LLKL concentrations (4.68, 2.34 and 1.17\u00a0g/kg/d) improved several diabetic parameters after a 6-week treatment. Moreover, LLKL modulated gut microbiota dysbiosis, increased the expression of occluding and maintained intestinal epithelial homeostasis, leading to a reduction in LPS, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels. Hepatic transcriptomic analysis showed that the Toll-like receptor signalling pathway was markedly enriched by LLKL treatment. RT-qPCR results validated that LLKL treatment decreased the expressions of TLR4, MyD88 and CTSK. Furthermore, a gene set enrichment analysis indicated that LLKL enhanced the insulin signalling pathway and inhibited glycerolipid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism, which were verified by the liver biochemical analysis. These findings demonstrate that LLKL ameliorates hyperglycaemia, modulates the gut microbiota and regulates the gut-liver axis, which might contribute to its anti-diabetic effect.",

        "Abstract": "The BES1/BZR1 transcription factors regulate the expression of genes responsive to brassinosteroids and play pivotal roles in plant development, but their role in regulating kernel development in maize remains unclear. In this study, we found that ZmBES1/BZR1-5 positively regulates kernel size. Association analysis of candidate genes in 513 diverse maize inbred lines indicated that three SNPs related to ZmBES1/BZR1-5 were significantly associated with kernel width and whilst four SNPs were related to 100-kernel weight. Overexpression of ZmBES1/BZR1-5 in Arabidopsis and rice both significantly increased seed size and weight, and smaller kernels were produced in maize Mu transposon insertion and EMS mutants. The ZmBES1/BZR1-5 protein locates in the nucleus, contains bHLH and BAM domains, and shows no transcriptional activity as a monomer but forms a homodimer through the BAM domain. ChIP-sequencing analysis, and yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays demonstrated that the protein binds to the promoters of AP2/EREBP genes (Zm00001d010676 and Zm00001d032077) and inhibits their transcription. cDNA library screening showed that ZmBES1/BZR1-5 interacts with casein kinase II subunit \u03b24 (ZmCKII\u03b24) and ferredoxin 2 (ZmFdx2) in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Taken together, our study suggests that ZmBES1/BZR1-5 positively regulates kernel size, and provides new insights into understanding the mechanisms of kernel development in maize.",

        "Abstract": "High tibial osteotomy (HTO) has a history of nearly 60\u2009years and has been widely used in clinical practice. Biplanar open wedge high tibial osteotomy (BOWHTO), which evolved from HTO, is an important therapy for the knee osteoarthritis. In our previous research, we found that the decrease of hemoglobin levels after high tibial osteotomy ranges from between 17 to 41\u2009g/L, but this is highly inconsistent with the intraoperative bleeding and postoperative drainage observed in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to investigate the perioperative hidden blood loss (HBL) after biplanar open wedge high tibial osteotomy (BOWHTO), as well as to study the effect of the actual correction angle on blood loss.",

        "Abstract": "The liver maintains hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during development. However, it is not clear what cells are the components of the developing liver niche in vivo. Here, we genetically dissected the developing liver niche by systematically determining the cellular source of a key HSC niche factor, stem cell factor (SCF). Most HSCs were closely associated with sinusoidal vasculature. Using Scfgfp knockin mice, we found that Scf was primarily expressed by endothelial and perisinusoidal hepatic stellate cells. Conditional deletion of Scf from hepatocytes, hematopoietic cells, Ng2+ cells, or endothelial cells did not affect HSC number or function. Deletion of Scf from hepatic stellate cells depleted HSCs. Nearly all HSCs were lost when Scf was deleted from both endothelial and hepatic stellate cells. The expression of several niche factors was down-regulated in stellate cells around birth, when HSCs egress the developing liver. Thus, hepatic stellate and endothelial cells create perisinusoidal vascular HSC niche in the developing liver by producing SCF.",

        "Title": "The association of liver function biomarkers with internal exposure of short- and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins in residents from Jinan, China.",
        "Abstract": "Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) are pervasive environmental pollutants which have been reported to be hepatotoxic by laboratory cell and animal studies. However, the related epidemiological reports on their hepatotoxic effects to humans are sparse. In this study, we evaluated the associations between six liver enzymes and serum short-chain CP (SCCP) or medium-chain CP (MCCP) concentrations of 197 residents in Jinan, China. Serum S/MCCPs were detected by quadrupole time-of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source (APCI-QTOF-HRMS), and quantified by pattern deconvolution method. The associations between total serum S/MCCP concentrations (\u03a3S/MCCPs) and continuous liver enzyme levels were assessed by linear regression. Odds ratios (ORs) for the effects of serum \u03a3S/MCCPs concentrations on liver function biomarkers dichotomized by clinical reference intervals were predicted by logistic regression, either treating \u03a3S/MCCPs as continuous or categorical dependents. After multivariable adjustment, linear regression results illustrated that 1-ln unit increase in serum \u03a3SCCPs was negatively associated with male PA levels [-6.08, 95% confidence interval (CI):\u00a0-11.90,\u00a0-3.25, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05], positively associated with male TB levels (1.80, 95% CI: 0.28, 3.31, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and positively associated with female AST levels (1.39, 95% CI: 0.07, 2.70, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). One-ln unit increase in serum \u03a3MCCPs was negatively associated male PA levels (-7.56, 95% CI:\u00a0-17.15,\u00a0-4.03, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Logistic regression results suggested that male serum \u03a3SCCPs were associated with increased prevalence of abnormal PA (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.47 per 1 ln-unit increase, CI\u00a0=\u00a01.18, 1.82) and TB (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.75, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.12, 2.76) levels, and male serum \u03a3MCCPs were significantly associated with increased prevalence of abnormal PA (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.43, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.03, 1.97) levels. In addition, male participants with concentrations above the median \u03a3S/MCCPs were associated with increased risk for abnormal PA levels [SCCPs, 2.11-fold (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.15, 3.87); MCCPs, 1.94-fold (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.24, 3.03)]. Male participants with concentrations above the median \u03a3SCCPs were also associated with increased risk for abnormal TB levels (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.75, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.12, 2.76). Conclusively, our results revealed that CP internal exposure was associated with disturbed liver biomarker levels, suggesting the hepatotoxicity of both SCCPs and MCCPs to humans.",

Experience-dependent translation of Ng is critical for encoding contextual memory, and Ng regulates developmental plasticity in the primary visual cortex during the critical period. However, the overall impact of Ng on the neuronal signaling that regulates synaptic plasticity is unknown.",

        "Abstract": "The application of natural preservatives has become an attractive method for controlling postharvest decay of fruits and vegetables. Allicin, the main active ingredient of allium plants, has broad-spectrum antifungal activity. However, the unstable properties of allicin limit its wide application. In this study, 1-[(R)-ethylsulfinyl]sulfanylethane, a structurally stable derivative of allicin, was used to explore its antifungal activity and potential mechanism on the expansion of Penicillium expansum. We demonstrated the antifungal activity of 1-[(R)-ethylsulfinyl]sulfanylethane through in vitro antifungal experiments. At the concentration is 2\u2009mg/L, 1-[((R)-ethylsulfinyl]sulfanyl]ethane can completely inhibit spore germination and mycelial growth, whereas the concentration of allicin needs to reach 16\u2009mg/L. Fungal Biochemical assay indicated that decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, overgeneration of reactive oxygen species, decrease of adenosine triphosphate\u00a0and glutathione content, increase of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and malondialdehyde\u00a0content. The results revealed that 1-[(R)-ethylsulfinyl]sulfanylethane induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in P. expansum. Due to its excellent antifungal activity, 1-[((R)-ethylsulfinyl]sulfanyl]ethane might be developed as a substitute for fungicides against P. expansum in postharvest fruit storage.",

        "Abstract": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has the potential to become the next common noninvasive neuroimaging technique for routine clinical use. Compared to the current standard for neuroimaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), fNIRS boasts several advantages which increase its likelihood for clinical adoption. However, fNIRS suffers from an intrinsic interference from the superficial tissues, which the near-infrared light must penetrate before reaching the deeper cerebral cortex. Therefore, the removal of signals captured by SS channels has been proposed to attenuate the systematic interference. This study aimed to investigate the task-related systemic artefacts, in a high-density montage covering the sensorimotor cortex. We compared the association between LS and SS channels over the contralateral motor cortex which was activated by a hand clenching task, with that over the ipsilateral cortex where no task-related activation was expected. Our findings provide important guidelines regarding how to removal SS signals in a high-density whole-head montage.",

        "Abstract": "An accurate determination of the foam simulation parameters is crucial in modeling foam flow in porous media. In this paper, we present an integrated workflow to obtain the parameters in the local equilibrium foam model by history matching a series of laboratory experiments performed at reservoir conditions (131 F and 1500 psi) on Estaillades limestone using a commercial reservoir simulator. The gas-water and water-oil relative permeability curves were first validated after history matching with the unsteady-state flooding experiments. The modeling parameters for foam generation and foam dry-out effect were obtained by history matching with the gas/surfactant coinjection experiments at varying foam quality and injection rates. Moreover, the modeling parameters for the destabilizing effect of oil on foam and foam shear thinning effect were derived after history matching with the foam-enhanced oil recovery process and oil fractional flow experiments in the laboratory. In practice, the calculated results reproduce the experimental outputs reasonably well. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis of foam modeling parameters is investigated to determine the most dominating parameters for accurate simulation of foam-enhanced oil recovery process in porous media. In this work, an efficient parameter estimation approach is developed from reliable foam flooding experimental data, which may be further applied to field-scale simulation. Moreover, the simulation approach can also be utilized to facilitate our interpretation of complex lab foam flooding results.",

        "Abstract": "The amplitude and phase distributions of reflection or transmission light are locally disturbed by damage regions. The damage state of optical components under successive laser irradiation can be evaluated according to the phase variation of a transmitted beam. The measurement accuracy of phase information related to the phase-unwrapping method is a critical factor for evaluating the damage state. This study analyzes and compares the performance of two important phase-unwrapping methods for detecting on-line large damage sites based on optimal modified lateral shearing interferometry. Meanwhile, the system stability and the measurement repeatability are also validated according to the retrieved phase pattern, which is beneficial to estimating the measurement accuracy. Experimental results of optical films are also presented and discussed to verify the feasibility of the estimation method utilized and the recommended phase-unwrapping method for on-line detection of the laser-induced damage growth features.",

        "Abstract": "Blackbody cavity reflectivity is normally measured using an integrating sphere to collect hemispherical reflected radiation from a blackbody opening when illuminated by a directional light source. The challenge of taking this method without an integrating sphere arises for blackbody cavity emissivity measurement in satellites due to space constraints. The ratio of hemispherical-given solid angle reflections is proposed to calculate the total reflected power from a blackbody cavity by multiplying a measurable reflected power in a given solid angle. The ratio is obtained by simulating the distribution relationship between the total hemispherical reflected light power and the reflected light power in the given solid angle under different coating emissivity. The emissivity measurement results are consistent with radiometric method measurements and simulation results, with an uncertainty of 0.0005.",

        "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women, and metastasis is the leading cause of death in breast cancer patients. Previous studies have shown that epithelial\u2011mesenchymal transition (EMT) is involved in the metastasis of breast cancer, but the metabolic reprogramming and regulation mechanisms involved in the EMT process are still unclear. In the present study, we successfully constructed an EMT cell model induced by transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u2011\u03b21) treatment of MCF\u20117 cells at different times. The results showed that cell adhesion decreased, cell invasion increased and ATP levels increased in EMT MCF\u20117 cells treated with TGF\u2011\u03b21. Furthermore, the expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) was decreased, and the expression of key fatty acid \u03b2\u2011oxidation enzymes (CPT1 and CD36) was elevated in treated cells compared to control cells. These results showed that the fatty acid oxidation pathway was enhanced. In addition, the expression of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B8 (NDUFB8), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COXI) increased, and the mitochondrial DNA copy number and ROS levels were also significantly increased during TGF\u2011\u03b21\u2011induced EMT. These results indicated that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity was enhanced during EMT. In addition, we observed that the expression of p\u2011AMPK was increased and ACC (Acetyl\u2011CoA Carboxylase) was decreased during TGF\u2011\u03b21\u2011induced EMT in MCF\u20117 cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of clinical samples revealed high expression of FASN in epithelial cells that had high expression of E\u2011cadherin, while high expression of CPT\u20111 was observed in mesenchymal cells that had high expression of vimentin. Results of the current study showed a metabolic transition in TGF\u2011\u03b21\u2011induced EMT in MCF\u20117 cells. This transition may regulate fatty acid oxidation and OXPHOS activity in EMT MCF\u20117 cells through the p\u2011AMPK pathway. These data suggest that a metabolic transition that suppresses lipogenesis and favors energy production is an essential component of TGF\u2011\u03b21\u2011induced EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. This study thus provides a new strategy for identifying new therapeutic targets for breast cancer.",

        "Title": "Oltipraz Prevents High Glucose-Induced Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis in RSC96 Cells through the Nrf2/NQO1 Signalling Pathway.",
        "Abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). Schwann cell (SC) apoptosis contributes to the occurrence and development of DPN. Effective drugs to prevent SC apoptosis are required to relieve and reverse peripheral nerve injury caused by DM. Oltipraz [4-methyl-5-(2-pyrazinyl)-1,2-dithiole-3-thione], an agonist of nuclear factor erythroid derived-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), exerts strong effect against oxidative stress in animal models or clinical patients in certain diseases, including heart failure, acute kidney injury, and liver injury. The aim of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of oltipraz in preventing SC apoptosis induced by high glucose levels. RSC96 cells pretreated with oltipraz were cultured in high-glucose medium (50\u2009mM glucose) for 24\u2009h, and cells cultured in medium containing 5\u2009mM glucose were used as the control. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the degree of apoptosis. A Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to assess cell viability. The mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using JC-1 staining, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was measured using 20,70-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining. In addition, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were also evaluated using the corresponding kits. Flow cytometry was subsequently used to detect apoptosis, and western blotting was used to measure the expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid derived-2-related factor 2 and NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1. The results showed that high glucose concentration increased oxidative stress and apoptosis in RSC96 cells. Oltipraz improved cell viability and reduced apoptosis of RSC96 cells in the high glucose environment. Additionally, oltipraz exhibited a significant antioxidative effect, as shown by the decrease in MDA levels, increased SOD levels, and reduced ROS generation in RSC96 cells. The results of the present study suggest that oltipraz exhibits potential as an effective drug for treatment with DPN.",

        "Abstract": "This article is concerned with the distributed secondary frequency and voltage control for islanded microgrids. First, the distributed secondary control problem is formulated by taking both communication delays and switching topologies into account. Second, by using an Artstein model reduction method, a novel delay-compensated distributed control scheme is proposed to restore frequencies of each distributed generator (DG) to a reference level in finite time, while achieving active power sharing in prescribed finite-time regardless of initial deviations generated from primary control. Third, a distributed finite-time controller is developed to regulate voltages of all DGs to a reference level. Fourth, the proposed idea is also applied to deal with the finite-time consensus for first-order multiagent systems. Finally, case studies are carried out, demonstrating the effectiveness, the robustness against load changes, and the plug-and-play capability of the proposed controllers.",

        "Abstract": "Finding an appropriate adsorbent with high adsorption capacity, quick adsorption kinetics and easy regeneration was crucial to the removal of gallic acid (GA) from water and wastewater. Our aims were to investigate whether a magnetic ion exchange (MIEX) resin had the three merits mentioned above, and investigate the feasibility of GA adsorption on MIEX resin, and the adsorption kinetics, equilibrium, thermodynamics, regeneration and mechanism using batch tests. The uptake of GA increased with increasing GA concentration. The GA concentration influenced the time needed to reach equilibrium, but the adsorption could be completed within 120 min. Elevating temperature facilitated the GA removal. The removal percent remained above 95.0% at pH 5.0-11.0. Carbonate and bicarbonate promoted the GA removal; conversely chloride, sulfate and nitrate restrained the GA removal significantly. The adsorption kinetics could be fitted well with the pseudo second-order model, and the film diffusion governed the whole adsorption rate. The equilibrium data followed the Redlich-Peterson isotherm model. The adsorption was a spontaneous, endothermic and entropy driven process. The ion exchange dominated the removal mechanism. The spent MIEX resin was well regenerated by sodium chloride. Therefore, MIEX resin is a potential adsorbent for removing GA quickly and efficiently from water and wastewater.",

        "Abstract": "In order to analyze and control air pollutant emissions effectively, on the basis of comprehensive consideration of three different pollution sources of industrial sulfur dioxide, industrial nitrogen oxides, and industrial smoke and dust, the Tapio decoupling model and LMDI decomposition model with six decomposition variables are constructed to compare the effects of socioeconomic factors on industrial air pollutant emissions in 11 cities in Zhejiang Province during 2006-2017. Then, a decoupling effort model is developed to analyze the effectiveness of the decoupling efforts taken at city level. This study found that (1) during the period of 2006-2017, the air pollutant emission reduction work in Zhejiang Province achieved remarkable results. More specifically, economic scale effect and population effect are the main factors for the increase of air pollutant emissions. And, the energy emission intensity effect and technological progress are the main driving forces for the reduction of three atmospheric pollutants, followed by the reduction effect of industrial structure and energy structure. (2) The environmental pollution problems of different air pollution sources in different cities are heterogeneous. (3) Eleven cities in Zhejiang Province have made significant decoupling efforts on the emission of three kinds of air pollutants, but there are some differences in the trend of the decoupling effort index of different pollution sources in different cities. In the future, illustrating by the example of Zhejiang, we should implement a \"common but different\" emission reduction strategy and emphasize pollutant emissions control during energy use in the efforts of further promoting the reduction of air pollutants.",

        "Abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) originating from mesenchyme is one of the most common invasive tumors of bone, and has an extremely high mortality rate. Previous studies have reported that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in the tumorigenesis and progression of a multitude of human cancers. The lncRNA DSCAM-AS1 has been reported to be an oncogenic gene in many cancers. However, the roles and regulatory mechanisms of DSCAM-AS1 in OS have not been deeply investigated. In this study, our findings prove that DSCAM-AS1 is highly expressed in OS cells. Knockdown of DSCAM-AS1 suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness, and induced cell apoptosis in OS. Additionally, knockdown of DSCAM-AS1 inactivated the Wnt-\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, research into its molecular mechanisms confirmed that DSCAM-AS1 functions as a sponge for miR-101-3p, and that ",

        "Abstract": "Human exposure to chlorinated paraffins (CPs) has been expected and assessed by external pathways considering their pervasive environmental occurrence. However, the deficiency of external exposure assessment in characterizing human burden is unavoidable. In addition, the associations between health outcomes and CP contents in human biospecimen are rarely assessed. In this study, we reported the occurrence and homologue profiles of short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs) in serum samples from 145 residents aged from 50 to 84 in Jinan, Shandong Province of China using quadrupole time-of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source operated in negative ion mode (APCI-qTOF-HRMS). The associations between serum CP concentrations and hematologic parameters were further analyzed by linear regression. We identified high level of \u2211SCCPs (median\u00a0=\u00a0107\u00a0ng/g wet weight, ww; 13,800\u00a0ng/g lipid, lw), \u2211MCCPs (median\u00a0=\u00a0134\u00a0ng/g ww; 15,200\u00a0ng/g lw) and elevated \u2211MCCPs/\u2211SCCPs (median\u00a0=\u00a01.12) in serum of the studied population.

        "Abstract": "The present study aimed to establish a decision tree (DT) model by combining the parameters of conventional gray-scale ultrasonography (US), elastosonography (ES), color Doppler US (CDUS) and contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) for the differential diagnosis of thyroid nodules. A single-center, retrospective study of 321 thyroid nodules was conducted. For 222 nodules, parameters of conventional gray-scale US, CDUS, ES and CEUS were evaluated using univariate logistic regression. Factors for with P<0.10 were further assessed using multivariate logistic regression. Significant factors (P<0.05) were used to establish a DT. The diagnostic accuracy of this DT was then evaluated by its application to the other 99 nodules. After univariate logistic analysis, factors including gender, number of nodules and diffuse disease were excluded, due to P>0.10. The results of multivariate logistic analysis determined that the following factors were required for the DT: Extent of blood flow determined by CDUS (P=0.002), area ratio determined by ES (P=0.033), peak phase patterns determined by CEUS (P<0.001) and micro-calcification determined by conventional gray-scale US (P=0.015). When compared to the pathological or cytological results of 99 nodules, the resulting DT had a sensitivity of 98.6%, specificity of 80.1%, positive predictive value of 93.5% and negative predictive value of 95.5%. These results suggested that a DT combining conventional gray-scale US, ES, CDUS and CEUS may be helpful for differentiating between types of thyroid nodules.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) contributes to intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). The long non\u2011coding RNA MALAT1 has been revealed to play an important role in diabetes\u2011associated complications. However, the specific role of MALAT1 in diabetes\u2011associated IDD has not been determined. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the roles of MALAT1 in the apoptosis of cartilage endplate (CEP) cells induced by high glucose and to explore the mechanisms underlying this effect. Rat CEP cells were cultured in high\u2011glucose medium (25\u00a0mM glucose) for 24\u00a0or 72\u00a0h. Cells cultured in medium containing 5\u00a0mM glucose were used as a control. Flow cytometry was used to detect the degree of apoptosis. Reverse transcription\u2011quantitative PCR was used to measure the expression of MALAT1 mRNA. In addition, CEP cells were treated with different conditions (high glucose, high glucose\u00a0+\u00a0MALAT1 negative control, high glucose\u00a0+\u00a0MALAT1 RNAi, normal control) for 72\u00a0h. Flow cytometry was subsequently used to detect apoptosis and western blotting was used to measure the expression levels of total and phosphorylated p38. The results revealed that high glucose concentration promoted apoptosis and enhanced expression of MALAT1 in CEP cells. Furthermore, MALAT1 knockout decreased the expression levels of total and phosphorylated p38 and reduced the apoptosis of rat CEP cells. The results obtained in the present study indicated that MALAT1 may serve as an important therapeutic target for curing or delaying IDD in patients with diabetes.",

Therefore, it is difficult for clinical professionals to identify women who will not practice EBF well and provide subsequent medical suggestions and treatments. This study aimed to apply a decision tree (DT) model to predict EBF at two months postpartum. The socio-demographic, clinical and breastfeeding parameters of 1,141 breastfeeding women from Nanjing were evaluated. Decision tree modelling was used to analyse and screen EBF factors and establish a risk assessment model of EBF. The Chinese version of the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale (CV-BSES) score, early formula supplementation, abnormal nipples, mastitis, neonatal jaundice, cracked or sore nipples and intended duration of breastfeeding were significant risk factors associated with EBF in the DT model. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the DT model were 73.1%, 75.5% and 66.3%, respectively. The DT model showed similar or better performance than the logistic regression model in assessing the risk of early cessation of EBF before two months postpartum. The DT model has potential for application in clinical practice and identifies high-risk subpopulations that need specific prevention.",

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal tumors and the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Since traditional biopsies are invasive and do not reflect tumor heterogeneity or monitor the dynamic progression of tumors, there is an urgent need for new noninvasive methods that can supplement and improve the current management strategies of CRC. Blood-based liquid biopsies are a promising noninvasive biomarker that can detect disease early, assist in staging, monitor treatment responses, and predict relapse and metastasis. Over time, an increasing number of experiments have indicated the clinical utility of liquid biopsies in CRC. In this review, we mainly focus on the development of circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA as key components of liquid biopsies in CRC and introduce the potential of exosomal microRNAs as emerging liquid biopsy markers in clinical application for CRC.",

        "Abstract": "This 1:5 case-control study aimed to identify the risk factors of hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) and to develop a mathematical model of nomogram for the risk prediction of HAPIs. Data for 370 patients with HAPIs and 1971 patients without HAPIs were extracted from the adverse events and the electronic medical systems. They were randomly divided into two sets: training (n = 1951) and validation (n = 390). Significant risk factors were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses in the training set, followed by a nomogram constructed. Age, independent movement, sensory perception and response, moisture, perfusion, use of medical devices, compulsive position, hypoalbuminaemia, an existing pressure injury or scarring from a previous pressure injury, and surgery sufferings were considered significant risk factors and were included to construct a nomogram. In both of the training and validation sets, the areas of 0.90 under the receiver operating characteristic curves showed excellent discrimination of the nomogram; calibration plots demonstrated a good consistency between the observed probability and the nomogram's prediction; decision curve analyses exhibited preferable net benefit along with the threshold probability in the nomogram. The excellent performance of the nomogram makes it a convenient and reliable tool for the risk prediction of HAPIs.",

        "Abstract": "Affected by illumination, gesture, expression and other factor's variation, face image pattern is easy to be changed, so it is important to find a robust data representation for the correct classification of face pattern. In this paper, a face image recognition algorithm based on 2-D Gabor wavelet transform and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is proposed. LBP is a local describe operator, which is invariant against illumination variation. 2-D Gabor wavelet transform have the invariant property against pose and expression variation. Experimental results show that the large scale 2-D Gabor wavelet representation could get good classification accuracy. Using LBP to describe 2-D Gabor wavelet representation of face image, together with image block, histogram statistics, PCA dimensionality reduction, nearestneighbors classification, we finally find this algorithm can get a better classification performance in different scales and directions.",

        "Title": "The Roles of Cyclin-Dependent Kinases in Cell-Cycle Progression and Therapeutic Strategies in Human Breast Cancer.",
        "Abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are serine/threonine kinases whose catalytic activities are regulated by interactions with cyclins and CDK inhibitors (CKIs). CDKs are key regulatory enzymes involved in cell proliferation through regulating cell-cycle checkpoints and transcriptional events in response to extracellular and intracellular signals. Not surprisingly, the dysregulation of CDKs is a hallmark of cancers, and inhibition of specific members is considered an attractive target in cancer therapy. In breast cancer (BC), dual CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, combined with other agents, were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently for the treatment of hormone receptor positive (HR+) advanced or metastatic breast cancer (A/MBC), as well as other sub-types of breast cancer. Furthermore, ongoing studies identified more selective CDK inhibitors as promising clinical targets. In this review, we focus on the roles of CDKs in driving cell-cycle progression, cell-cycle checkpoints, and transcriptional regulation, a highlight of dysregulated CDK activation in BC. We also discuss the most relevant CDK inhibitors currently in clinical BC trials, with special emphasis on CDK4/6 inhibitors used for the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor 2-negative (HER2-) M/ABC patients, as well as more emerging precise therapeutic strategies, such as combination therapies and microRNA (miRNA) therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Root water uptake is strongly influenced by the morphology and anatomical structure of roots, which are regulated by nitrogen forms and environmental stimuli. To further illustrate the roles of different nitrogen forms on root water uptake under osmotic stress, a split-root system was supplied with different nitrogen forms and osmotic stress simulated by adding 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG, 6000). The local effects of nitrogen form and osmotic stress on root morphology, anatomical structure, root lignin content, and water uptake rate were investigated. Under osmotic stress conditions, ammonium markedly promoted the formation and elongation of the lateral root, whereas a significant decrease in numbers of lateral roots was observed under local nitrate supply. Under nitrate supply in split-root systems, osmotic stress significantly promoted root cell death and more aerenchyma formation, as well as accelerated the lignification of the root. However, osmotic stress had no negative effect on the root anatomical structure under ammonium supply. The root water uptake rate was significantly higher in split-root supplied with ammonium than nitrate under osmotic stress conditions. In conclusion, the high water uptake ability in local ammonium supply was associated with the more lateral roots development and the lower cell death, aerenchyma formation and lignification under osmotic stress.",

        "Abstract": "Uranium mining and milling activities for many years resulted in release of uranium into the adjoining soil in varying degrees. Bioremediation approaches (i.e., immobilization via the action of bacteria) resulting in uranium bearing solid is supposed as an economic and clean in-situ approach for the treatment of uranium contaminated sites. This study purposes to determine the immobilization efficiency of uranium in soil by Leifsonia sp. The results demonstrated that cells have a good proliferation ability under the stress of uranium and play a role in retaining uranium in soil. Residual uranium in active Leifsonia-medium group (66%) was higher than that in the controls, which was 31% in the deionised water control, 46% in the Leifsonia group, and 47% in the medium group, respectively. This indicated that Leifsonia sp. facilitates the immobilization efficiency of uranium in soil by converting part of the reducible and oxidizable fraction of uranium into the residual fraction. X-ray photoelectron fitting results showed that tetravalent states uranium existed in the soil samples, which indicated that the hexavalent uranium was converted into tetravalent by cells. This is the first report of effect of Leifsonia sp. on uranium immobilization in soil. The findings implied that Leifsonia sp. could, to some extent, prevent the migration and diffusion of uranium in soil by changing the chemical states into less toxicity and less risky forms.",

        "Abstract": "Naked-eye detection pH sensor is becoming a powerful tool in food safety monitoring. In this work, a pH sensor was developed by incorporating cellulose modified with acidochromic dye into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The results indicated that the dye (up to 170.4\u202f\u03bcmol/g) was successfully anchored to cellulose. It was demonstrated that the addition of acidochromic regenerated cellulose (ARC) resulted in enhancement of tensile strength, elongation at break and maximum decomposition temperature by 44 %, 43.6 % and 11\u202f\u00b0C, respectively. The pH sensor demonstrated that a visible color change from yellow to brick-red and to purple when placed in solutions of pH\u202f=\u202f7, 10 and 12. The pH sensor showed excellent resistance to leaching under strong acidic and alkaline conditions. When applied to spoiled shrimp, an evident color change from yellow to brown was observed, suggesting it could serve as an easy-to-use, non-destructive visual indicator system for real-time food monitoring.",

        "Abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a poor prognosis despite conventional treatments of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors acting on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have shown high efficacy and low toxicity for NSCLC. In particular, combining erlotinib with the VEGF antibody bevacizumab has therapeutic value in NSCLC, but the drugs' separate effects as monotherapy and any adverse outcomes of combination therapy remain unclear.",

        "Abstract": "Black phosphorus nanoparticles (BP NPs) possess great advantages in photocatalysis owing to the rich surface active sites, extremely high carrier mobility, and strong visible-near-infrared light response. However, the complex preparation process, poor stability, and rapid carrier recombination restrict their successful application in photocatalysis. Herein, the above problems are resolved by preparing BP NPs through a facile sonication-assisted hydrothermal method. To further improve the stability and photocatalytic activity, BP NPs are tightly anchored onto ZnS to prepare ZnS-BP porous nanosheets. With the Zn-P coordination bond built between them, higher stability, enhanced carrier transport ability, and excellent hydrogen adsorption and desorption equilibrium of photocatalysts are achieved. An efficient and recyclable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 1561 \u03bcmol h",

        "Abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is the most prevailing malignant tumor of digestive tract and accounts for a considerable part of cancer-relevant deaths worldwide. An increasing number of literatures highlight the important role of lncRNAs in the occurrence and development of GC. Considering that the function of RHPN1-AS1 in GC remains to be fully inquired, we purposed to investigate the potential and mechanism of RHPN1-AS1 in GC. The expression of RHPN1-AS1 was significantly upregulated in GC samples and cells. High RHPN1-AS1 level was strongly correlated with advanced stages of GC and predicted poor outcomes of GC. Furthermore, depletion of RHPN1-AS1 inhibited cell proliferation and cell cycle whereas promoted cell apoptosis. Subcellular fractionation analysis expounded the main expression of RHPN1-AS1 in GC cell cytoplasm. Herein, we conjectured that RHPN1-AS1 might exert its performance in GC through the ceRNA network. Our findings demonstrated that RHPN1-AS1 enhanced ETS1 expression via sponging miR-1299. More importantly, the transcriptional activation of RHPN1-AS1 was mediated by ETS1. Results of recue assays validated that RHPN1-AS1/miR-1299/ETS1 positive feedback loop aggravated the malignant behaviors of GC, revealing RHPN1-AS1 as a latent effective target for the treatment of GC patients.",

        "Abstract": "Cellulosic colloidal suspensions present unique opportunities for rheological modification of complex fluids. In this work, the rheological behavior of regenerated cellulose (RC) suspensions, including their oscillating shear and time-dependent behavior, as well as yield stress, were studied. The rheological effects of sodium alginate's addition to aqueous RC solutions subject to shear flow were investigated. The results reveal that the RC suspension exhibited \"gel-like\" behavior and had a shear-thinning property. At increasing RC concentrations, the suspensions' yield stress and the extent of viscosity recovery after plastic deformation had both increased. The viscoelastic suspensions underwent a transition from \"solid-like\" to \"liquid-like\" behavior upon sodium alginate's inclusion. Sodium alginate was found to enhance RC suspensions' viscosity recoverability. Furthermore, with increasing concentrations of sodium alginate, the yield stress of RC suspension began to decrease and then vanished, occurring below the 1:1 RC: sodium alginate weight ratio with total solid content fixed at 1\u00a0wt%, due to RC's inability to form an extended network RC. This study yields insights into the rheology of RC suspensions and the influence of sodium alginate and supports both their usage as rheological modifies in applications such as coatings, drug delivery systems, and additive manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing.",

        "Abstract": "Diffuse optical tomography (DOT), a subset of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), is a noninvasive functional imaging modality for studying the human brain in normal and diseased conditions. It measures changes in concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) in the blood vasculature of the brain. In contrast to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the gold standard in human brain imaging, DOT offers the advantage of higher temporal resolution, portability, lower cost, multiple contrasts and usability for persons who cannot otherwise utilize MRI-based imaging modalities, including bedridden patients and infants, etc. The goal of the present study was to evaluate performance of a DOT method in studying dynamic patterns of brain activations involving motor control. CW-fNIRS data were acquired in four sessions from a healthy male participant when he performed a motor task in a block-design experiment. Results from experimental data showed pronounced activity in the primary motor cortex (M1), contralateral to the clenching hand. It was further observed that the M1 activity was consistent over four sessions. Furthermore, temporal dynamics of motor activity at each session further revealed well-sequenced activation patterns among M1, premotor cortex (PMC), and supplementary motor area (SMA). Timed ipsilateral motor activity suppression was also observed several seconds after the onset of contralateral M1 activity. More importantly, these temporal dynamics were similarly observed in all four sessions. These preliminary results suggest that the DOT method has the sensitivity, reliability, and spatio-temporal resolutions to study activities originated from the motor cortices. A full-scope evaluation and validation in more participants on the motor system can establish it as a promising neuroimaging tool to study, such as, infants at the risk of cerebral palsy or elders with Parkinson's due to its portability and usability in clinical environments.",

        "Abstract": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive optical functional neuroimaging that has seen rapid development and increasing use in studying human brain under normal and diseased conditions. Compared with blood-oxygenation-level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI), fNIRS offers advantages including its low cost, portability and compatibility with implanted medical devices. Thus, fNIRS can be used to monitor brain activity particularly in infants, elders and patients who are unable to undergo routine fMRI scans. However, fNIRS suffers from its susceptibility to scalp and to systemic physiological noises. Fluctuations originated from heartbeat, respiration and low-frequency oscillations lead to contamination of cerebral activity. In order to tap the full potential of fNIRS, it is essential to eliminate these confounding noises from fNIRS measurements. Therefore, the present study aims to understand the underlying relationship between superficial signals and the compound signals respectively measured by short channels and long channels of fNIRS optodes in a whole head configuration. Our results reveal that: 1) 49.56% of total variances in long-channel data are contributed by a global component shared across all long channels; 2) this global component is significantly correlated with the superficial fluctuations extracted from short-channel data. Finally, our findings indicate that compound signals measured by long channels of fNIRS are contaminated by superficial fluctuations and that careful removal of these fluctuations from long-channel data is critical in obtaining accurate images of cerebral activity with fNIRS.",

        "Title": "Reconstructing Cortical Intrinsic Connectivity Networks Using a Regression Method Combining EEG Data from Sensor and Source Levels",
        "Abstract": "Intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) have been widely studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and electrophysiological data (e.g., electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG)). Two major methods, i.e., seed-based correlation analysis (SBCA) and independent component analysis (ICA), are widely used to extract ICNs. Among them, ICA usually involves a dual regression analysis in order to obtain final spatial definitions of ICNs. Recently, we proposed a framework that includes cortical source imaging, source-level ICA, and statistical correlation analysis, to extract cortical ICNs from resting-state EEG data. In the present study, we proposed an alternative framework that uses sensor-level ICA and regression analysis instead of source-level ICA and correlation analysis, considering the well-studied characteristics of sensor-level ICs in differentiating neural activities from artifacts and the benefit of regression in accommodating multivariate analysis over correlation. In the present study, we mainly investigated the performance of the proposed procedure in extracting cortical ICNs. Meanwhile, we also investigated different variants of the regressors sampled at different frequencies to formulate the regression model. The results demonstrated that cortical ICNs corresponding to major ICNs identified in literature could be obtained by the proposed framework. In general, spatial patterns of cortical ICNs obtained via both correlation and regression analyses show statistically significant similarity. However, the cortical ICNs reconstructed using the regression analysis exhibit more focal and more superficial spatial patterns, in general, that the cortical ICNs from the correlation analysis. The different variants of regressors at the same sampling frequency do not produce obvious impacts on spatial patterns of cortical ICNs, while the different sampling frequencies show large effects on extracted spatial patterns of cortical ICNs. In summary, it is suggested that the proposed framework with the regression analysis is promising in reconstructing cortical ICNs from EEG, while the sampling frequency used in the formulation process of regressors may have large impacts on reconstructed cortical ICN patterns.",

        "Title": "Optimization of Culturomics Strategy in Human Fecal Samples.",
        "Abstract": "Most bacteria in the human gut are difficult to culture, and culturomics has been designed to overcome this issue. Culturomics makes it possible to obtain living bacteria for further experiments, unlike metagenomics. However, culturomics is work-intensive, which prevents its wide application. In this study, we performed a 30-day continuous enrichment in blood culture bottles and cultured bacterial isolates from pre-cultures removed at different time points. We compared the bacteria isolated from the enriched culture with or without adding fresh medium after each pre-culture was removed. We also compared \"experienced\" colony picking (i.e., picking two to three colonies for each recognized colony type) and picking all the colonies from each plate. In total, from five fecal samples, 106 species were isolated, including three novel species and six that have not previously been isolated from the human body. Adding fresh medium to the culture increased the rate of bacterial species isolation by 22% compared with the non-supplemented culture. Picking all colonies increased the rate of bacterial isolation by only 8.5% compared with experienced colony picking. After optimization through statistical analysis and simulation, sampling aerobic and anaerobic enrichment cultures at six and seven time-points, respectively, is likely to isolate >90% of bacterial species, reducing the workload by 40%. In conclusion, an extended enrichment step ensures isolation of different bacterial species at different time-points, while adding the same quantity of fresh medium after sampling, the experienced picking and the optimized time-points favor the chance of isolating more bacterial species with less work.",

        "Abstract": "Culturomics can ascertain traces of microorganisms to be cultivated using different strategies and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry or 16S rDNA sequencing. However, to cater to all requirements of microorganisms and isolate as many species as possible, multiple culture conditions must be used, imposing a heavy workload. In addition, the fast-growing bacteria (e.g., Escherichia) surpass the slow-growing bacteria in culture by occupying space and using up nutrients. Besides, some bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas) suppress others by secreting antibacterial metabolites, making it difficult to isolate bacteria with lower competence. Applying inhibitors to restrain fast-growing bacteria is one method to cultivate more bacterial species from human feces.",

Deletion of Cldn7 by gene targeting leads to the inflammatory bowel disease-like phenotype in mice, which includes weight loss, diarrhea, mucosa ulceration, and severe intestinal epithelial damage.

        "Abstract": "This article is concerned with designing resilient state feedback controllers for a class of networked control systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The sensor samples system states periodically. The DoS attacks usually prevent those sampled signals from being transmitted through a communication network. A logic processor embedded in the controller is introduced to not only receive sampled signals but also capture information on the duration time of each DoS attack. Note that the duration time of DoS attacks is usually both lower and upper bounded. Then the closed-loop system is modeled as an aperiodic sampled-data system closely related to both lower and upper bounds of duration time of DoS attacks. By introducing a novel looped functional, which caters for the N -order canonical Bessel-Legendre inequalities, some N -dependent stability criteria are presented for the resultant closed-loop system. It is worth pointing out that a number of identity formulas are uncovered, which enable us to apply the notable free-weighting matrix approach to derive less conservative stability criteria. A linear-matrix-inequality-based criterion is provided to design stabilizing state-feedback controllers against DoS attacks. A satellite control system is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

This study used the regression kriging (RK) method to estimate grassland carbon stocks in Northeast China based on Landsat8 operational land imager (OLI) images and five remote sensing variables. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), the chlorophyll index (CI), Band6 and Band7 were used to build the RK models separately and to explore their capabilities for modeling spatial distributions of grassland carbon stocks. To explore the different model performances for typical grassland and meadow grassland, the models were validated separately using the typical steppe, meadow steppe or all-steppe ground measurements based on leave-one-out crossvalidation (LOOCV). When the results were validated against typical steppe samples, the Band6 model showed the best performance (coefficient of determination (R",

        "Abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a relevant risk factor for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Steatohepatitic HCC (SH-HCC), characterized by HCC with steatosis, is influenced by lipid metabolism disorders. A hypoxic microenvironment is common in HCC and affects lipid metabolism. However, whether hypoxia-induced HIF-2\u03b1 upregulation exacerbates lipid accumulation to contribute to SH-HCC progression remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that HIF-2\u03b1 was elevated in tissues from NAFLD-HCC patients and was associated with survival. Under hypoxic conditions, upregulated HIF-2\u03b1 was accompanied by lipid accumulation and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway activation. HIF-2\u03b1 knockdown (KD) in steatotic HCC ameliorated triglyceride accumulation and steatosis. HIF-2\u03b1-KD steatotic HCC showed minimal lipid synthesis in a hypoxic environment, which contributes to a reduction in malignant behaviours. However, treatment with MHY1485 restored these behaviours. STAM mice, a mouse model that develops NAFLD-HCC, exhibit more rapid tumour progression upon exposure to hypoxia. STAM mice treated with INK-128 presented abrogated mTOR expression and tumour progression under hypoxic conditions with lower triglycerides and steatosis. In conclusion, in a hypoxic microenvironment, HIF-2\u03b1 upregulation promotes steatotic HCC progression by activating lipid synthesis via the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Therefore, HIF-2\u03b1 can be a biomarker and target in developing specific therapeutic measures for NAFLD-HCC patients.",

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major cause of carcinoma-related deaths worldwide. MicroRNA-498 (miR-498) modulates the development of a variety of biological events, including tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether miR-498 plays a role in CRC. This study was designed to elucidate the underlying mechanism and role of miR-498 in modulation of the viability and invasiveness of CRC cells. We report that CRC tissues and cells exhibited decreased expression of miR-498, and that overexpression of miR-498 resulted in reduced proliferation of CRC cells, concomitant with increased apoptosis. Furthermore, bioinformatic prediction and dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-498 targeted the 3'-UTR of Bcl-2 for silencing. However, Bcl-2 overexpression suppressed the proapoptosis of miR-498 on CRC cells. In summary, we describe a possible role of miR-498 in CRC, which may lead to the identification of new targets for treatment of this malignancy.",

        "Abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive, prevalent, and distinct subtype of breast cancer characterized by high recurrence rates and poor clinical prognosis, devoid of both predictive markers and potential therapeutic targets. MicroRNAs (miRNA/miR) are a family of small, endogenous, non-coding, single-stranded regulatory RNAs that bind to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) complementary sequences and downregulate the translation of target mRNAs as post-transcriptional regulators. Dysregulation miRNAs are involved in broad spectrum cellular processes of TNBC, exerting their function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on their cellular target involved in tumor initiation, promotion, malignant conversion, and metastasis. In this review, we emphasize on masses of miRNAs that act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), maintenance of stemness, tumor invasion and metastasis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. We also discuss miRNAs as the targets or as the regulators of dysregulation epigenetic modulation in the carcinogenesis process of TNBC. Furthermore, we show that miRNAs used as potential classification, prognostic, chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance markers in TNBC. Finally, we present the perspective on miRNA therapeutics with mimics or antagonists, and focus on the challenges of miRNA therapy. This study offers an insight into the role of miRNA in pathology progression of TNBC.",
