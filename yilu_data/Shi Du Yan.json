        "Abstract": "Yiyi Fuzi Baijiang Powder(YFBP), originating from Synopsis of the Golden Chamber, is a classic prescription composed of Coicis Semen, Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata, and Patriniae Herba for the treatment of abscesses and pus discharge. This article presented a systematic analysis of the clinical application of YFBP, including the indicated diseases, the number of cases, efficacy, dosage, administration methods, and compatibility with other drugs. The analysis reveals that YFBP has a wide range of clinical applications. It is commonly used, often with modifications or in combination with western medicine, for diseases in the fields of gastroente-rology, gynecology, urology, dermatology, and others. And most of the Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) evidence involved in these diseases are damp-heat evudence. The prescription shows rich variations in clinical administration methods, and most of which are the treatment of aqueous decoction of it. The therapeutic effect is also significant, and the total effective rate of clinical treatment is re-latively high. Additionally, this article summarized the pharmacological research on YFBP and found that it possessed various pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and immune-modulating properties. Finally, correlation analysis was conducted on the main diseases, TCM types, prescription doses, pharmacological effects and action targets of YFBP, which to show the relationship between these five aspects in a visual form, reflecting the relationship between its clinical application and modern pharmacological effects. These findings provide a reference basis for further development and research on YFBP.",

        "Abstract": "Cyclophilin D (CypD), a peptidylprolyl isomerase F (PPIase), plays a central role in opening the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore leading to cell death. CypD resides in the mitochondrial matrix, associates with the inner mitochondrial membrane, interacts with amyloid beta to exacerbate mitochondrial and neuronal stress and has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We report the biological activity of a small-molecule CypD inhibitor (C-9), which binds strongly to CypD and attenuates mitochondrial and cellular perturbation insulted by A\u03b2 and calcium stress. Binding affinities for C-9 were determined using in vitro surface plasmon resonance. This compound antagonized calcium-mediated mitochondrial swelling, abolished A\u03b2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction as shown by increased cytochrome c oxidase activity and adenosine-5'-triphosphate levels, and inhibited CypD PPIase enzymatic activity by real-time fluorescence capture assay using Hamamatsu FDSS 7000. Compound C-9 seems a good candidate for further investigation as an AD drug.",

        "Abstract": "Cyclophilin D (CypD) is a key mitochondrial target for amyloid-\u03b2-induced mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction and is considered a potential drug target for Alzheimer's disease. The high-resolution crystal structures of primitive orthorhombic (CypD-o) and primitive tetragonal (CypD-t) forms have been determined to 1.45 and 0.85\u2005\u00c5 resolution, respectively, and are nearly identical structurally. Although an isomorphous structure of CypD-t has previously been reported, the structure reported here was determined at atomic resolution, while CypD-o represents a new crystal form for this protein. In addition, each crystal form contains a PEG 400 molecule bound to the same region along with a second PEG 400 site in CypD-t which occupies the cyclosporine A inhibitor binding site of CypD. Highly precise structural information for CypD should be extremely useful for discerning the detailed interaction of small molecules, particularly drugs and/or inhibitors, bound to CypD. The 0.85\u2005\u00c5 resolution structure of CypD-t is the highest to date for any CypD structure.",

        "Abstract": "Bioenergetic dysfunction occurs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a clinical syndrome that frequently precedes symptomatic AD. In this study, we modeled AD and MCI bioenergetic dysfunction by transferring mitochondria from MCI, AD and control subject platelets to mtDNA-depleted SH-SY5Y cells. Bioenergetic fluxes and bioenergetics-related infrastructures were characterized in the resulting cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cell lines. Relative to control cybrids, AD and MCI cybrids showed changes in oxygen consumption, respiratory coupling and glucose utilization. AD and MCI cybrids had higher ADP/ATP and lower NAD+/NADH ratios. AD and MCI cybrids exhibited differences in proteins that monitor, respond to or regulate cell bioenergetic fluxes including HIF1\u03b1, PGC1\u03b1, SIRT1, AMPK, p38 MAPK and mTOR. Several endpoints suggested mitochondrial mass increased in the AD cybrid group and probably to a lesser extent in the MCI cybrid group, and that the mitochondrial fission-fusion balance shifted towards increased fission in the AD and MCI cybrids. As many of the changes we observed in AD and MCI cybrid models are also seen in AD subject brains, we conclude reduced bioenergetic function is present during very early AD, is not brain-limited and induces protean retrograde responses that likely have both adaptive and mal-adaptive consequences.",

        "Abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) is a key event mediating the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as A\u03b2 promotes synaptic dysfunction and triggers neuronal death. Recent evidence has linked the hormone leptin to AD as leptin levels are markedly attenuated in AD patients. Leptin is also a potential cognitive enhancer as it facilitates the cellular events underlying hippocampal learning and memory. Here we show that leptin prevents the detrimental effects of A\u03b2(1-42) on hippocampal long-term potentiation. Moreover leptin inhibits A\u03b2(1-42)-driven facilitation of long-term depression and internalization of the 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2- oxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit, GluR1, via activation of PI3-kinase. Leptin also protects cortical neurons from A\u03b2(1-42)-induced cell death by a signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3)-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, leptin inhibits A\u03b2(1-42)-mediated upregulation of endophilin I and phosphorylated tau in vitro, whereas cortical levels of endophilin I and phosphorylated tau are enhanced in leptin-insensitive Zucker fa/fa rats. Thus leptin benefits the functional characteristics and viability of neurons that degenerate in AD. These novel findings establish that the leptin system is an important therapeutic target in neurodegenerative conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcriptional factor responsible for cellular and tissue adaption to low oxygen tension. HIF-1, a heterodimer consisting of a constitutively expressed \u03b2 subunit and an oxygen-regulated \u03b1 subunit, regulates a series of genes that participate in angiogenesis, iron metabolism, glucose metabolism, and cell proliferation/survival. The activity of HIF-1 is controlled by post-translational modifications on different amino acid residues of its subunits, mainly the alpha subunit. Besides in ischemic stroke (see review [1]), emerging evidence has revealed that HIF-1 activity and expression of its down-stream genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and erythropoietin, are altered in a range of neurodegenerative diseases. At the same time, experimental and clinical evidence has demonstrated that regulating HIF-1 might ameliorate the cellular and tissue damage in the neurodegenerative diseases. These new findings suggest HIF-1 as a potential medicinal target for the neurodegenerative diseases. This review focuses on HIF-1\u03b1 protein modifications and HIF-1's potential neuroprotective roles in Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), Huntington's diseases (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).",

        "Abstract": "The aim of our project was to study the effect of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemia on sciatic nerve morphology, blood plasma markers and immunohistochemical expression of RAGE (the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products), and its ligands-S100B and Carboxymethyl Lysine (CML)-advanced glycation endproduct (AGE) in the laboratory pig. Six months after STZ-injections, blood plasma measurements, morphometric analysis of sciatic nerve fiber density, immunofluorescent distribution of potential molecular neuropathy contributors, ELISA measurement of plasma AGE level and HPLC analysis of sciatic nerve levels of one of the pre-AGE and the glycolysis intermediate products-methyl-glyoxal (MG) were performed. The results of our study revealed that STZ-injected animals displayed elevated levels of plasma glucose, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) and triglycerides. The sciatic nerve of STZ-injected pigs revealed significantly lower numbers of small-diameter myelinated fibers, higher immunoreactivity for RAGE and S100B and increased levels of MG as compared to control animals. Our results correspond to clinical findings in human patients with hyperglycemia/diabetes-evoked peripheral neuropathy and suggest that the domestic pig may be a suitable large animal model for the study of mechanisms underlying hyperglycemia-induced neurological complications in the peripheral nerve and may serve as a relevant model for the pre-clinical assessment of candidate drugs in neuropathy.",

        "Abstract": "Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) is a multiligand member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules which serves as a receptor for amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) on neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and cells of vessel wall. Increased expression of RAGE is observed in regions of the brain affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Abeta-RAGE interaction in vitro leads to cell stress with the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of downstream signaling mechanisms including the MAP kinase pathway. RAGE-mediated activation of p38 MAP kinase in neurons causes Abeta-induced inhibition of long-term potentiation in slices of entorhinal cortex. Increased expression of RAGE in an Abeta-rich environment, using transgenic mouse models, accelerates and accentuates pathologic, biochemical, and behavioral abnormalities compared with mice overexpressing only mutant amyloid-beta protein precursor. Interception of Abeta interaction with RAGE, by infusion of soluble RAGE, decreases Abeta content and amyloid load, as well as improving learning/memory and synaptic function, in a murine transgenic model of Abeta accumulation. These data suggest that RAGE may be a therapeutic target for AD.",

        "Abstract": "The multiligand receptor RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end-products) is emerging as a central mediator in the immune/inflammatory response. Epidemiological evidence accruing in the human suggests upregulation of RAGE's ligands (AGEs, S100/calgranulins, high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), and amyloid beta-peptide and beta-sheet fibrils) and the receptor itself at sites of inflammation and in chronic diseases such as diabetes and neurodegeneration. The consequences of ligand-RAGE interaction include upregulation of molecules implicated in inflammatory responses and tissue damage, such as cytokines, adhesion molecules, and matrix metalloproteinases. In this review, we discuss the localization of RAGE and its ligand families and the biological impact of this axis in multiple cell types implicated in chronic diseases. Lastly, we consider findings from animal model studies suggesting that although tissue-damaging effects ensue from recruitment of the ligand-RAGE interaction, in distinct settings, adaptive and repair/regeneration outcomes appear to override detrimental effects of RAGE. As RAGE blockade moves further into clinical development, clarifying the biology of RAGE garners ever-increasing importance.",

        "Abstract": "Oligomeric amyloid-beta (Abeta) interferes with long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognitive processes, suggesting that Abeta peptides may play a role in the neuronal dysfunction which characterizes the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multiple lines of evidence have highlighted RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end-products) as a receptor involved in Abeta-induced neuronal and synaptic dysfunction. In the present study, we investigated the effect of oligomeric soluble Abeta1-42 on LTP elicited by the stimulation of different intracortical pathways in the mouse visual cortex. A variety of nanomolar concentrations (20-200 nM) of Abeta1-42 were able to inhibit LTP in cortical layer II-III induced by either white matter (WM-Layer II/III) or the layer II/III (horizontal pathway) stimulation, whereas the inhibition of LTP was more susceptible to Abeta1-42, which occurred at 20 nM of Abeta, when stimulating layer II-III horizontal pathway. Remarkably, cortical slices were resistant to nanomolar Abeta1-42 in the absence of RAGE (genetic deletion of RAGE) or blocking RAGE by RAGE antibody. These results indicate that nanomolar Abeta inhibits LTP expression in different neocortical circuits. Crucially, it is demonstrated that Abeta-induced reduction of LTP in different cortical pathways is mediated by RAGE.",

        "Abstract": "Cyclophilin D (CypD, encoded by Ppif) is an integral part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, whose opening leads to cell death. Here we show that interaction of CypD with mitochondrial amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) potentiates mitochondrial, neuronal and synaptic stress. The CypD-deficient cortical mitochondria are resistant to Abeta- and Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial swelling and permeability transition. Additionally, they have an increased calcium buffering capacity and generate fewer mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the absence of CypD protects neurons from Abeta- and oxidative stress-induced cell death. Notably, CypD deficiency substantially improves learning and memory and synaptic function in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model and alleviates Abeta-mediated reduction of long-term potentiation. Thus, the CypD-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition pore is directly linked to the cellular and synaptic perturbations observed in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Blockade of CypD may be a therapeutic strategy in Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Ovarian hormone decline after menopause may influence cognitive performance and increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women. Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has been proposed to be the primary cause of AD. In this study, we examined whether ovariectomy (OVX) could affect the levels of cofactors Abeta-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD) and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), which have been reported to potentiate Abeta-mediated neuronal perturbation, in mouse hippocampus, correlating with estrogen and Abeta levels. Female ICR mice were randomly divided into ovariectomized or sham-operated groups, and biochemical analyses were carried out at 5 weeks after the operation. OVX for 5 weeks significantly decreased hippocampal 17beta-estradiol level, while it tended to reduce the hormone level in serum, compared with the sham-operated control. In contrast, OVX did not affect hippocampal Abeta(1-40) level, although it significantly increased serum Abeta(1-40) level. Furthermore, we demonstrated that OVX increased hippocampal ABAD level in neurons, but not astrocytes, while it did not affect RAGE level. These findings suggest that the expression of neuronal ABAD depends on estrogen level in the hippocampus and the increase in serum Abeta and hippocampal ABAD induced by ovarian hormone decline may be associated with pre-stage of memory deficit in postmenopausal women and Abeta-mediated AD pathology.",

        "Abstract": "Soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is likely to play a key role during early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by perturbing synaptic function and cognitive processes. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been identified as a receptor involved in Abeta-induced neuronal dysfunction. We investigated the role of neuronal RAGE in Abeta-induced synaptic dysfunction in the entorhinal cortex, an area of the brain important in memory processes that is affected early in AD. We found that soluble oligomeric Abeta peptide (Abeta42) blocked long-term potentiation (LTP), but did not affect long-term depression, paired-pulse facilitation, or basal synaptic transmission. In contrast, Abeta did not inhibit LTP in slices from RAGE-null mutant mice or in slices from wild-type mice treated with anti-RAGE IgG. Similarly, transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative form of RAGE targeted to neurons showed normal LTP in the presence of Abeta, suggesting that neuronal RAGE functions as a signal transducer for Abeta-mediated LTP impairment. To investigate intracellular pathway transducing RAGE activation by Abeta, we used inhibitors of stress activated kinases. We found that inhibiting p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), but not blocking c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation, was capable of maintaining LTP in Abeta-treated slices. Moreover, Abeta-mediated enhancement of p38 MAPK phosphorylation in cortical neurons was reduced by blocking antibodies to RAGE. Together, our results indicate that Abeta impairs LTP in the entorhinal cortex through neuronal RAGE-mediated activation of p38 MAPK.",

As a ubiquitously expressed cell surface receptor, RAGE mediates the effects of Abeta on microglia, blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neurons through activating different signaling pathways. Data from autopsy brain tissues, in vitro cell cultures and transgenic mouse models suggest that Abeta-RAGE interaction exaggerates neuronal stress, accumulation of Abeta, impaired learning memory, and neuroinflammation.

        "Abstract": "Protein kinase C-betaII (PKCbetaII) is an important modulator of cellular stress responses. To test the hypothesis that PKCbetaII modulates the response to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, we subjected mice to occlusion and reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Homozygous PKCbeta-null (PKCbeta(-/-)) and wild-type mice fed the PKCbeta inhibitor ruboxistaurin displayed significantly decreased infarct size and enhanced recovery of left ventricular (LV) function and reduced markers of cellular necrosis and serum creatine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels compared with wild-type or vehicle-treated animals after 30 min of ischemia followed by 48 h of reperfusion. Our studies revealed that membrane translocation of PKCbetaII in LV tissue was sustained after I/R and that gene deletion or pharmacological blockade of PKCbeta protected ischemic myocardium. Homozygous deletion of PKCbeta significantly diminished phosphorylation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal mitogen-activated protein kinase and expression of activated caspase-3 in LV tissue of mice subjected to I/R. These data implicate PKCbeta in I/R-mediated myocardial injury, at least in part via phosphorylation of JNK, and suggest that blockade of PKCbeta may represent a potent strategy to protect the vulnerable myocardium.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer patients have increased levels of both the 42 amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta) and the amyloid binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD), which is an intracellular binding site for Abeta. The overexpression of Abeta and ABAD in transgenic mice has shown that the binding of Abeta to ABAD results in amplified neuronal stress and impairment of learning and memory. From a proteomic analysis of the brains from these animals, we have identified for the first time that the protein endophilin I increases in Alzheimer diseased brain. The increase in endophilin I levels in neurons is linked to an increase in the activation of the stress kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase with the subsequent death of the neurons. We also demonstrate in living animals that the expression level of endophilin I is an indicator for the interaction of ABAD and Abeta as its expression levels return to normal if this interaction is perturbed. Therefore this identifies endophilin I as a new indicator of the progression of Alzheimer disease.",

        "Abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction is one of the early features in Alzheimer's disease (AD) affected brain. Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), a major peptide deposited in neuritic plaques, has been considered as an important initiating molecule in the pathogenesis of AD. However, the pathogenic role of Abeta remains to be determined. Here, we review current studies showing that progressive accumulation of Abeta occurs within the mitochondria of both transgenic mice overexpressing mutant Abeta peptide precursor protein and autopsied brains from AD patients. Interaction of Abeta with Abeta-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD), a short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase in the mitochondrial matrix, leads to mitochondrial dysfunction evidenced by increased reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondrial membrane permeability formation and caspase-3-like activity induction, and decreased activities of the Krebs cycle. These effects can be blocked by intracellular transduction of the ABAD decoy peptide. We hypothesize that Abeta-induced and mitochondria-dependent cytotoxic pathways might play an important role in AD pathogenesis and could be a potential therapeutic target.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that Abeta progressively accumulates within mitochondrial matrix, providing a direct link to mitochondrial toxicity. Abeta-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD) is localized to the mitochondrial matrix and binds to mitochondrial Abeta. Interaction of ABAD with Abeta exaggerates Abeta-mediated mitochondrial and neuronal perturbation, leading to impaired synaptic function, and dysfunctional spatial learning/memory. Thus, blockade of ABAD/Abeta interaction may be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD.",

        "Title": "Collapsin response mediator protein-2 hyperphosphorylation is an early event in Alzheimer's disease progression.",
        "Abstract": "Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) is an abundant brain-enriched protein that can regulate microtubule assembly in neurons. This function of CRMP2 is regulated by phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). Here, using novel phosphospecific antibodies, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of CRMP2 at Ser522 (Cdk5-mediated) is increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, while CRMP2 expression and phosphorylation of the closely related isoform CRMP4 are not altered. In addition, CRMP2 phosphorylation at the Cdk5 and GSK3 sites is increased in cortex and hippocampus of the triple transgenic mouse [presenilin-1 (PS1)(M146V)KI; Thy1.2-amyloid precursor protein (APP)(swe); Thy1.2tau(P301L)] that develops AD-like plaques and tangles, as well as the double (PS1(M146V)KI; Thy1.2-APP(swe)) transgenic mouse. The hyperphosphorylation is similar in magnitude to that in human AD and is evident by 2 months of age, ahead of plaque or tangle formation. Meanwhile, there is no change in CRMP2 phosphorylation in two other transgenic mouse lines that display elevated amyloid beta peptide levels (Tg2576 and APP/amyloid beta-binding alcohol dehydrogenase). Similarly, CRMP2 phosphorylation is normal in hippocampus and cortex of Tau(P301L) mice that develop tangles but not plaques. These observations implicate hyperphosphorylation of CRMP2 as an early event in the development of AD and suggest that it can be induced by a severe APP over-expression and/or processing defect.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's patients have increased levels of both the 42 beta amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta) and amyloid binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD) which is an intracellular binding site for Abeta. The over-expression of Abeta and ABAD in transgenic mice has shown that the binding of Abeta to ABAD results in exaggerating neuronal stress and impairment of learning and memory. From a proteomic analysis of the brains from these animals we identified that peroxiredoxin II levels increase in Alzheimer's diseased brain. This increase in peroxiredoxin II levels protects neurons against Abeta induced toxicity. We also demonstrate, for the first time in living animals, that the expression level of peroxiredoxin II is an indicator for the interaction of ABAD and Abeta as its expression levels return to normal if this interaction is perturbed. Therefore this indicates the possibility of reversing changes observed in Alzheimer's disease and that the Abeta-ABAD interaction is a suitable drug target.",

Recent studies revealed that amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) gains access into mitochondrial matrix, which was much more pronounced in both AD brain and transgenic mutant APP mice than in normal controls. Abeta progressively accumulates in mitochondria and mediates mitochondrial toxicity. Interaction of mitochondrial Abeta with mitochondrial enzymes such as amyloid beta binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD) exaggerates mitochondrial stress by inhibiting the enzyme activity, releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS), and affecting glycolytic, Krebs cycle and/or the respiratory chain pathways through the accumulation of deleterious intermediate metabolites. The pathways proposed may play a key role in the pathogenesis of this devastating neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease.",

The searches for mitochondrial DNA variants associated with AD susceptibility have generated conflicting results. The age-related accumulation of somatic mitochondrial DNA deletion has been suggested to play a pathogenic role in the development of AD. Recent studies have demonstrated that amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) progressively accumulates in mitochndrial matrix, as demonstrated in both transgenic mice over-expressing mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and autopsy brain from AD patients. Abeta-mediated mitochondrial stress was evidenced by impaired oxygen consumption and decreased respiratory chain complexes III and IV activities in brains from AD patients and AD-type transgenic mouse model. Furthermore, our studies indicated that interaction of intramitochondrial Abeta with a mitochondrial enzyme, amyloid binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD), inhibits its enzyme activity, enhances generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), impairs energy metabolism, and exaggerates Abeta-induced spatial learning/memory deficits and neuropathological changes in transgenic AD-type mouse model.

Hyperglycemia may be caused by a number of underlying factors; however, the consequences of chronically elevated glucose are similar. Both the macrovasculature and microvasculature are exquisitely sensitive to the long-term effects of elevated blood glucose. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetes, regardless of the underlying cause of hyperglycemia. Although other substrates, such as DNA, are susceptible to glycation, this article addresses the impact of nonenzymatic glycation on the proteome. The impact of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) on alteration of protein function and signal transduction mechanisms contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes complications. This suggests that blocking the generation or molecular impact of AGEs may modulate the complications of diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "Mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction have been linked to Alzheimer's disease for some time. Key questions regarding this association concern the nature and mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction, and whether such changes in metabolic properties are pathogenic or secondary, with respect to neuronal degeneration. In terms of mitochondria and Alzheimer's, altered function could reflect intrinsic properties of this organelle, potentially due to mutations in mitochondrial DNA, or extrinsic changes secondary to signal transduction mechanisms activated in the cytosol. This review presents data relevant to these questions, and considers the implication of recent findings demonstrating the presence of amyloid-beta peptide in mitochondria, as well as intra-mitochondrial molecular targets with which it can interact. Regardless of the underlying mechanism(s), it is likely that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to oxidant stress which is commonly observed in brains of patients with Alzheimer's and transgenic models of Alzheimer's-like pathology.",

These processes are accelerated in hyperglycemia and play key roles in the increased incidence and severity of myocardial infarction and stroke observed in diabetes. Evidence suggests that the ligands of the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), a multiligand member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, interact with this receptor to play important roles in both early development and progression of atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation. Studies in animal models of vascular injury underscored the potent impact of RAGE blockade; administration of ligand-binding decoys of RAGE or antibodies to the receptor reduced the consequences of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and physical injury to the vessel wall. This review focuses on the ligand repertoire of RAGE, the impact of ligand-RAGE interaction, and the potent effect of RAGE blockade in rodent models of vascular injury.",

        "Abstract": "The complications of diabetes are myriad and represent a rising cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in the Western world. The update of the Diabetes Control and Clinical Trials Group/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Research Group (DCCT/EDIC) suggested that previous strict control of hyperglycaemia was associated with reduced carotid atherosclerosis compared to conventional treatment, even after levels of glycosylated haemoglobin between the two treatment groups became indistinguishable. These intriguing findings prompt the key question, why does the blood vessel 'remember'? This review focuses on the hypothesis that the ligand/RAGE axis contributes importantly to glycaemic 'memory'. Studies in rodent models of diabetes suggest that blockade or genetic modification of RAGE suppress diabetes-associated progression of atherosclerosis, exaggerated neointimal expansion consequent to acute arterial injury, and cardiac dysfunction. We propose that therapeutic RAGE blockade will intercept maladaptive diabetes-associated memory in the vessel wall and provide cardiovascular protection in diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "Although amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is the neurotoxic species implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), mechanisms through which intracellular Abeta impairs cellular properties, resulting in neuronal dysfunction, remain to be clarified. Here we demonstrate that intracellular Abeta is present in mitochondria from brains of transgenic mice with targeted neuronal overexpression of mutant human amyloid precursor protein and AD patients. Abeta progressively accumulates in mitochondria and is associated with diminished enzymatic activity of respiratory chain complexes (III and IV) and a reduction in the rate of oxygen consumption. Importantly, mitochondria-associated Abeta, principally Abeta42, was detected as early as 4 months, before extensive extracellular Abeta deposits. Our studies delineate a new means through which Abeta potentially impairs neuronal energetics, contributing to cellular dysfunction in AD.",

        "Abstract": "An important means of determining how amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) affects cells is to identify specific macromolecular targets and assess how Abeta interaction with such targets impacts on cellular functions. On the one hand, cell surface receptors interacting with extracellular Abeta have been identified, and their engagement by amyloid peptide can trigger intracellular signaling cascades. Recent evidence has indicated a potentially significant role for deposition of intracellular Abeta in cell stress associated with amyloidosis. Thus, specific intracellular targets of Abeta might also be of interest. Our review evaluates the potential significance of Abeta interaction with a mitochondrial enzyme termed Abeta-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD), a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase-reductase family concentrated in mitochondria of neurones. Binding of Abeta to ABAD distorts the enzyme's structure, rendering it inactive with respect to its metabolic properties, and promotes mitochondrial generation of free radicals. Double transgenic mice in which increased levels of ABAD are expressed in an Abeta-rich environment, the latter provided by a mutant amyloid precursor protein transgene, demonstrate accelerated decline in spatial learning/memory and pathologic changes. These data suggest that mitochondria ABAD, ordinarily a contributor to metabolic homeostasis, has the capacity to become a pathogenic factor in an Abeta-rich environment.",

The binding of soluble Abeta to soluble RAGE inhibits further aggregation of Abeta peptides, while membrane bound RAGE-Abeta interactions elicit activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor promoting sustained chronic neuroinflammation. Atomic force microscopy observations demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of RAGE, by interacting with Abeta, is a powerful inhibitor of Abeta polymerization even at prolonged periods of incubation. Hence, the potential RAGE-Abeta structural interactions were further explored utilizing a series of computational chemistry algorithms. Our modeling suggests that a soluble dimeric RAGE assembly creates a positively charged well into which the negative charges of the N-terminal domain of dimeric Abeta dock.",

        "Abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that PKCbeta contributes to vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation; processes central to the pathogenesis of restenosis consequent to vascular injury. Homozygous PKCbeta null (-/-) mice or wild-type mice fed the PKCbeta inhibitor, ruboxistaurin, displayed significantly decreased neointimal expansion in response to acute femoral artery endothelial denudation injury compared with controls. In vivo and in vitro analyses demonstrated that PKCbetaII is critically linked to SMC activation, at least in part via regulation of ERK1/2 MAP kinase and early growth response-1. These data highlight novel roles for PKCbeta in the SMC response to acute arterial injury and suggest that blockade of PKCbeta may represent a therapeutic strategy to limit restenosis.",

        "Abstract": "Axotomy of peripheral nerve stimulates events in multiple cell types that initiate a limited inflammatory response to axonal degeneration and simultaneous outgrowth of neurites into the distal segments after injury. We found that pharmacological blockade of RAGE impaired peripheral nerve regeneration in mice subjected to RAGE blockade and acute crush of the sciatic nerve. As our studies revealed that RAGE was expressed in axons and in infiltrating mononuclear phagocytes upon injury, we tested the role of RAGE in these distinct cell types on nerve regeneration. Transgenic mice expressing signal transduction-deficient RAGE in mononuclear phagocytes or peripheral neurons were generated and subjected to unilateral crush injury to the sciatic nerve. Transgenic mice displayed decreased functional and morphological recovery compared with littermate controls, as assessed by motor and sensory conduction velocities; and myelinated fiber density. In double transgenic mice expressing signal transduction deficient RAGE in both mononuclear phagocytes and peripheral neurons, regeneration was even further impaired, suggesting the critical interplay between RAGE-modulated inflammation and neurite outgrowth in nerve repair. These findings suggest that RAGE signaling in inflammatory cells and peripheral neurons plays an important role in plasticity of the peripheral nervous system.",

Inflammatory and neurite outgrowth-promoting roles for the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) have been suggested, so we tested its role in peripheral nerve regeneration. Analysis of immunohistochemical localization of RAGE by confocal microscopy revealed that RAGE was expressed in axons and infiltrating mononuclear phagocytes upon unilateral sciatic nerve crush in mice. Administration of soluble RAGE, the extracellular ligand binding domain of RAGE, or blocking F(ab')2 fragments of antibodies raised to either RAGE or its ligands, S100/calgranulins or amphoterin, reduced functional recovery as assessed by motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities and sciatic functional index and reduced regeneration, as assessed by myelinated fiber density after acute crush of the sciatic nerve. In parallel, in mice subjected to RAGE blockade, decreased numbers of mononuclear phagocytes infiltrated the distal nerve segments after crush. These findings provide the first evidence of an innate function of the ligand/RAGE axis and suggest that RAGE plays an important role in regeneration of the peripheral nervous system.",

Here, we report amyloid beta-peptide Abeta40 binds to immobilized LRP clusters II and IV with high affinity (Kd = 0.6-1.2 nM) compared to Abeta42 and mutant Abeta, and LRP-mediated Abeta brain capillary binding, endocytosis, and transcytosis across the mouse blood-brain barrier are substantially reduced by the high beta sheet content in Abeta and deletion of the receptor-associated protein gene. Despite low Abeta production in the brain, transgenic mice expressing low LRP-clearance mutant Abeta develop robust Abeta cerebral accumulations much earlier than Tg-2576 Abeta-overproducing mice. While Abeta does not affect LRP internalization and synthesis, it promotes proteasome-dependent LRP degradation in endothelium at concentrations > 1 microM, consistent with reduced brain capillary LRP levels in Abeta-accumulating transgenic mice, AD, and patients with cerebrovascular beta-amyloidosis. Thus, low-affinity LRP/Abeta interaction and/or Abeta-induced LRP loss at the BBB mediate brain accumulation of neurotoxic Abeta.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advance in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) microimaging has enabled in vivo cerebral blood volume (CBV) mapping with high spatial resolution. Using an intravascular susceptibility contrast agent and T(2)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a 9.4T NMR microimager, the regional CBV was measured in mice as the transverse relaxation increase induced by the contrast agent. CBV maps in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model at resting state were obtained and examined. Four-month-old male transgenic mutant APP (V717F, K670N/M671L) mice (N = 10) and littermate wild-type controls (N = 12) were used. Regional analysis of the multi-slice CBV maps revealed statistically significant CBV reductions among the APP mice in cerebral cortex (-9.29%, P = 0.0002), hippocampus (-4.22%, P = 0.02), and thalamus (-5.21%, P = 0.03), indicating an early change of microvasculature in these selected regions. No significant difference was found in olfactory bulb, pons, midbrain, superior colliculus, medulla, and cerebellum.",

        "Abstract": "The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) impairs mitochondrial respiration and damages dopaminergic neurons as seen in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we report that L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type II/amyloid binding alcohol dehydrogenase (HADH II/ABAD), a mitochondrial oxidoreductase enzyme involved in neuronal survival, is downregulated in PD patients and in MPTP-intoxicated mice. We also show that transgenic mice with increased expression of human HADH II/ABAD are significantly more resistant to MPTP than their wild-type littermates. This effect appears to be mediated by overexpression of HADH II/ABAD mitigating MPTP-induced impairment of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. This study demonstrates that HADH II/ABAD modulates MPTP neurotoxicity and suggests that HADH II/ABAD mimetics may provide protective benefit in the treatment of PD.",

        "Abstract": "While the initiation of the adaptive and innate immune response is well understood, less is known about cellular mechanisms propagating inflammation. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a transmembrane receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily, leads to perpetuated cell activation. Using novel animal models with defective or tissue-specific RAGE expression, we show that in these animal models RAGE does not play a role in the adaptive immune response. However, deletion of RAGE provides protection from the lethal effects of septic shock caused by cecal ligation and puncture. Such protection is reversed by reconstitution of RAGE in endothelial and hematopoietic cells. These results indicate that the innate immune response is controlled by pattern-recognition receptors not only at the initiating steps but also at the phase of perpetuation.",

        "Abstract": "The glycation and oxidation of proteins/lipids leads to the generation of a new class of biologically active moieties, the advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). Recent studies have elucidated that carboxymethyllysine (CML) adducts of proteins/lipids are a highly prevalent AGE in vivo. CML-modified adducts are signal transduction ligands of the receptor for AGE (RAGE), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Importantly, CML-modified adducts accumulate in diverse settings. In addition to enhanced formation in settings of high glucose, these adducts form in inflammatory milieu. Studies performed both in vitro and in vivo have suggested that the proinflammatory/tissue destructive consequences of RAGE activation in the diabetic/inflamed environment may be markedly attenuated by blockade of the ligand-RAGE axis. Here, we will summarize the known consequences of RAGE activation in the tissues and highlight novel areas for therapeutic intervention in these disease states.",

Here we show that the infusion of the ketone body d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DbetaHB) in mice confers partial protection against dopaminergic neurodegeneration and motor deficits induced by MPTP. These effects appear to be mediated by a complex II-dependent mechanism that leads to improved mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. Because of the safety record of ketone bodies in the treatment of epilepsy and their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, DbetaHB may be a novel neuroprotective therapy for PD.",

        "Abstract": "Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) interacts with the vasculature to influence Abeta levels in the brain and cerebral blood flow, providing a means of amplifying the Abeta-induced cellular stress underlying neuronal dysfunction and dementia. Systemic Abeta infusion and studies in genetically manipulated mice show that Abeta interaction with receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)-bearing cells in the vessel wall results in transport of Abeta across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and endothelin-1 (ET-1), the latter mediating Abeta-induced vasoconstriction. Inhibition of RAGE-ligand interaction suppresses accumulation of Abeta in brain parenchyma in a mouse transgenic model. These findings suggest that vascular RAGE is a target for inhibiting pathogenic consequences of Abeta-vascular interactions, including development of cerebral amyloidosis.",

        "Abstract": "Cellular proliferation, migration, and expression of extracellular matrix proteins and MMPs contribute to neointimal formation upon vascular injury. Wild-type mice undergoing arterial endothelial denudation displayed striking upregulation of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in the injured vessel, particularly in activated smooth muscle cells of the expanding neointima. In parallel, two of RAGE's signal transducing ligands, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and S100/calgranulins, demonstrated increased deposition/expression in the injured vessel wall. Blockade of RAGE, employing soluble truncated receptor or antibodies, or in homozygous RAGE null mice, resulted in significantly decreased neointimal expansion after arterial injury and decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation, migration, and expression of extracellular matrix proteins. A critical role for smooth muscle cell RAGE signaling was demonstrated in mice bearing a transgene encoding a RAGE cytosolic tail-deletion mutant, specifically in smooth muscle cells, driven by the SM22alpha promoter. Upon arterial injury, neointimal expansion was strikingly suppressed compared with that observed in wild-type littermates. Taken together, these data highlight key roles for RAGE in modulating smooth muscle cell properties after injury and suggest that RAGE is a logical target for suppression of untoward neointimal expansion consequent to arterial injury.",

        "Abstract": "Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules capable of interacting with a broad spectrum of ligands, including advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), amyloid fibrils, S100/calgranulins and amphoterin. The biology of RAGE is dictated by the accumulation of these ligands at pathologic sites, leading to upregulation of the receptor and sustained RAGE-dependent cell activation eventuating in cellular dysfunction. Although RAGE is not central to the initial pathogenesis of disorders in which it ultimately appears to be involved, such as diabetes, amyloidoses, inflammatory conditions and tumors (each of these conditions leading to accumulation of RAGE ligands), the receptor functions as a progression factor driving cellular dysfunction and exaggerating the host response towards tissue destruction, rather than restitution of homeostasis. These observations suggest that RAGE might represent a therapeutic target in a diverse group of seemingly unrelated disorders linked only by a multiligand receptor with an unusually wide and diverse repertoire of ligands, namely, RAGE.",

        "Abstract": "Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) is a multiligand member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules with a diverse repertoire of ligands. These ligands include products of nonenzymatic glycation, the Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs, enriched in the diabetic milieu), members of the S100/calgranulin family of proinflammatory mediators, beta-sheet fibrillar structures (characteristic of amyloid) and amphoterin (present at high levels in the tumor bed). Ligation of RAGE by its ligands upregulates expression of the receptor and triggers an ascending spiral of cellular perturbation due to sustained RAGE-mediated cellular activation. For example, in the setting of diabetes, a vascular environment rich in AGEs and S100/calgranulins accelerates atherogenesis in murine models, and this can be blocked by intercepting the interaction of ligands with RAGE. While RAGE is certainly not the cause of diabetes, it functions as a progression factor driving cellular dysfunction underlying the development of diabetic complications as the microenvironment becomes enriched in its ligands. Though further studies will be required to determine the importance of RAGE-mediated cellular activation to human chronic diseases, it represents a novel receptor-ligand system potentially impacting on a range of pathophysiologic conditions.",

        "Title": "Aldose reductase activation is a key component of myocardial response to ischemia.",
        "Abstract": "Aldose reductase, a member of the aldo-keto reductase family, has been implicated in the development of vascular and neurological complications in diabetes. Despite recent studies from our laboratory demonstrating protection of ischemic hearts by an aldose reductase inhibitor, the presence and influence of aldose reductase in cardiac tissue remain unknown. Our goal in this study was to isolate and characterize the kinetic properties of cardiac aldose reductase, as well as to study the impact of flux via this enzyme on glucose metabolism and contractile function in hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. Results demonstrate that ischemia increases myocardial aldose reductase activity and that these increases are, in part, due to activation by nitric oxide. The kinetic parameter of cardiac aldose reductase (Kcat) was significantly higher in ischemic tissues. Aldose reductase inhibition increased glycolysis and glucose oxidation. Aldose reductase inhibited hearts, when subjected to ischemia/reperfusion, exhibited less ischemic injury and was associated with lower lactate/pyruvate ratios (a measure of cytosolic NADH/NAD+), greater tissue content of adenosine triphosphate, and improved cardiac function. These findings indicate that aldose reductase is a component of ischemic injury and that pharmacological inhibitors of aldose reductase present a novel adjunctive approach for protecting ischemic hearts.",
