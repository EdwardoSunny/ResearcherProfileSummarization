        "Abstract": "Proteins and other biomolecules form dynamic macromolecular machines that are tightly orchestrated to move, bind, and perform chemistry. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) can access the intrinsic heterogeneity of these complexes and is therefore a key tool for understanding mechanism and function. However, 3D reconstruction of the resulting imaging data presents a challenging computational problem, especially without any starting information, a setting termed ab initio reconstruction. Here, we introduce a method, DRGN-AI, for ab initio heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction. With a two-step hybrid approach combining search and gradient-based optimization, DRGN-AI can reconstruct dynamic protein complexes from scratch without input poses or initial models. Using DRGN-AI, we reconstruct the compositional and conformational variability contained in a variety of benchmark datasets, process an unfiltered dataset of the DSL1/SNARE complex fully ab initio, and reveal a new \"supercomplex\" state of the human erythrocyte ankyrin-1 complex. With this expressive and scalable model for structure determination, we hope to unlock the full potential of cryo-EM as a high-throughput tool for structural biology and discovery.",

        "Abstract": "Targeted recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligases to degrade traditionally undruggable proteins is a disruptive paradigm for developing new therapeutics. Two salient limitations are that <2% of the ~600 E3 ligases in the human genome have been exploited to produce proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), and the efficacy of the approach has not been demonstrated for a vital class of complex multi-subunit membrane proteins- ion channels. NEDD4-1 and NEDD4-2 are physiological regulators of myriad ion channels, and belong to the 28-member HECT (homologous to E6AP C-terminus) family of E3 ligases with widespread roles in cell/developmental biology and diverse diseases including various cancers, immunological and neurological disorders, and chronic pain. The potential efficacy of HECT E3 ligases for targeted protein degradation is unexplored, constrained by a lack of appropriate binders, and uncertain due to their complex regulation by layered intra-molecular and posttranslational mechanisms. Here, we identified a nanobody that binds with high affinity and specificity to a unique site on the N-lobe of the NEDD4-2 HECT domain at a location physically separate from sites critical for catalysis- the E2 binding site, the catalytic cysteine, and the ubiquitin exosite- as revealed by a 3.1 \u00c5 cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction.

        "Title": "Structural features of thyroglobulin linked to protein trafficking.",
        "Abstract": "Thyroglobulin must pass endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control to become secreted for thyroid hormone synthesis. Defective thyroglobulin, blocked in trafficking, can cause hypothyroidism. Thyroglobulin is a large protein (~2750 residues) spanning regions I-II-III plus a C-terminal cholinesterase-like domain. The cholinesterase-like domain functions as an intramolecular chaperone for regions I-II-III, but the folding pathway leading to successful thyroglobulin trafficking remains largely unknown. Here, informed by the recent three-dimensional structure of thyroglobulin as determined by cryo-electron microscopy, we have bioengineered three novel classes of mutants yielding three entirely distinct quality control phenotypes. Specifically, upon expressing recombinant thyroglobulin, we find that first, mutations eliminating a disulfide bond enclosing a 200-amino acid loop in region I have surprisingly little impact on the ability of thyroglobulin to fold to a secretion-competent state. Next, we have identified a mutation on the surface of the cholinesterase-like domain that has no discernible effect on regional folding yet affects contact between distinct regions and thereby triggers impairment in the trafficking of full-length thyroglobulin. Finally, we have probed a conserved disulfide in the cholinesterase-like domain that interferes dramatically with local folding, and this defect then impacts on global folding, blocking the entire thyroglobulin in the ER. These data highlight variants with distinct effects on ER quality control, inhibiting domain-specific folding; folding via regional contact; neither; or both.",

        "Abstract": "Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential structural component of the bacterial cell wall that is synthetized during cell division and elongation. PG forms an extracellular polymer crucial for cellular viability, the synthesis of which is the target of many antibiotics. PG assembly requires a glycosyltransferase (GT) to generate a glycan polymer using a Lipid II substrate, which is then crosslinked to the existing PG via a transpeptidase (TP) reaction. A Shape, Elongation, Division and Sporulation (SEDS) GT enzyme and a Class B Penicillin Binding Protein (PBP) form the core of the multi-protein complex required for PG assembly. Here we used single particle cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of a cell elongation-specific E. coli RodA-PBP2 complex. We combine this information with biochemical, genetic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses to identify the Lipid II binding sites and propose a mechanism for Lipid II polymerization. Our data suggest a hypothesis for the movement of the glycan strand from the Lipid II polymerization site of RodA towards the TP site of PBP2, functionally linking these two central enzymatic activities required for cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis.",

The clinical phenotypes are variable, ranging from spontaneous recovery to serious illness and death. On March 2020, a global COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of February 2023, almost 670 million cases and 6,8 million deaths have been confirmed worldwide. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, contain a single-stranded RNA genome enclosed in a viral capsid consisting of four structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein, in the ribonucleoprotein core, the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, and the membrane (M) protein, embedded in the surface envelope. In particular, the E protein is a poorly characterized viroporin with high identity amongst all the \u03b2-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43) and a low mutation rate. Here, we focused our attention on the study of SARS-CoV-2 E and M proteins, and we found a general perturbation of the host cell calcium (Ca",

LGRs are present in all metazoan animals. In humans, the LGR ligands include glycoprotein hormones (GPHs) chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (hTSH). These hormones are \u03b1\u03b2 heterodimers of cystine-knot protein chains. LGRs and their ligand chains have coevolved. Ancestral hormone homologs, present in both bilaterian animals and chordates, are identified as \u03b12\u03b25. We have used single-wavelength anomalous diffraction and molecular replacement to determine structures of the \u03b12\u03b25 hormone from ",

        "Title": "Defective Thyroglobulin: Cell Biology of Disease.",
        "Abstract": "The primary functional units of the thyroid gland are follicles of various sizes comprised of a monolayer of epithelial cells (thyrocytes) surrounding an apical extracellular cavity known as the follicle lumen. In the normal thyroid gland, the follicle lumen is filled with secreted protein (referred to as colloid), comprised nearly exclusively of thyroglobulin with a half-life ranging from days to weeks. At the cellular boundary of the follicle lumen, secreted thyroglobulin becomes iodinated, resulting from the coordinated activities of enzymes localized to the thyrocyte apical plasma membrane. Thyroglobulin appearance in evolution is essentially synchronous with the appearance of the follicular architecture of the vertebrate thyroid gland. Thyroglobulin is the most highly expressed thyroid gene and represents the most abundantly expressed thyroid protein. Wildtype thyroglobulin protein is a large and complex glycoprotein that folds in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to homodimerization and export via the classical secretory pathway to the follicle lumen. However, of the hundreds of human thyroglobulin genetic variants, most exhibit increased susceptibility to misfolding with defective export from the endoplasmic reticulum, triggering hypothyroidism as well as thyroidal endoplasmic reticulum stress. The human disease of hypothyroidism with defective thyroglobulin (either homozygous, or compound heterozygous) can be experimentally modeled in thyrocyte cell culture, or in whole animals, such as mice that are readily amenable to genetic manipulation. From a combination of approaches, it can be demonstrated that in the setting of thyroglobulin misfolding, thyrocytes under chronic continuous ER stress exhibit increased susceptibility to cell death, with interesting cell biological and pathophysiological consequences.",

While the interaction between TRIP8b and the cytosolic C terminus of the channel has been structurally described, the HCN:TRIP8b stoichiometry is less characterized. We employed single molecule mass photometry (MP) to image HCN4 particles purified in complex with TRIP8b. Our data show that four TRIP8b subunits are bound to the tetrameric HCN4 particle, confirming a 1:1 stoichiometry.",

Here we present structures of ankyrin-1 complexes purified from human erythrocytes. We reveal the architecture of a core complex of ankyrin-1, the Rhesus proteins RhAG and RhCE, the band 3 anion exchanger, protein 4.2, glycophorin A and glycophorin B. The distinct T-shaped conformation of membrane-bound ankyrin-1 facilitates recognition of RhCE and, unexpectedly, the water channel aquaporin-1. Together, our results uncover the molecular details of ankyrin-1 association with the erythrocyte membrane, and illustrate the mechanism of ankyrin-mediated membrane protein clustering.",

        "Abstract": "The evolutionary benefit accounting for widespread conservation of oligomeric structures in proteins lacking evidence of intersubunit cooperativity remains unclear. Here, crystal and cryo-EM structures, and enzymological data, demonstrate that a conserved tetramer interface maintains the active-site structure in one such class of proteins, the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. Phylogenetic comparisons support a significantly longer polypeptide being required to maintain an equivalent active-site structure in the context of a single subunit. Oligomerization therefore enhances evolutionary fitness by reducing the metabolic cost of enzyme biosynthesis. The large surface area of the structure-stabilizing oligomeric interface yields a synergistic gain in fitness by increasing tolerance to activity-enhancing yet destabilizing mutations. We demonstrate that two paralogous SDR superfamily enzymes with different specificities can form mixed heterotetramers that combine their individual enzymological properties. This suggests that oligomerization can also diversify the functions generated by a given metabolic investment, enhancing the fitness advantage provided by this architectural strategy.",

        "Abstract": "Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 variant (APS3v) refers to an autoimmune condition in which both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and autoimmune thyroiditis (AITD) develop in the same individual. HLA-DR3 confers the strongest susceptibility to APS3v. Previously we reported a unique amino acid signature pocket that predisposes to APS3v. We found that this pocket is flexible and can trigger APS3v by presenting both thyroid (Tg.1571, TPO.758) and islet (GAD.492) peptides to induce autoimmune response. We hypothesized that blocking the specific APS3v-HLA-DR3 pocket from presenting thyroid/islet antigens can block the autoimmune response in APS3v. To test this hypothesis we performed a virtual screen of small molecules blocking APS3v-HLA-DR3, and identified 11 small molecules hits that were predicted to block APS3v-HLA-DR3. Using the baculovirus-produced recombinant APS3v-HLA-DR3 protein we tested the 11 small molecules in an ",

These liquid cryogens have a large difference between their melting and boiling temperatures and so can absorb substantial heat without formation of an insulating vapor layer adjacent to a cooling sample. However, ethane and propane are flammable, they must be liquified in liquid nitro-gen immediately before cryo-EM sample preparation, and cryocooled samples must be transferred to liquid nitro-gen for storage, complicating workflows and increasing the chance of sample damage during handling. Experiments over the last 15 years have shown that cooling rates required to vitrify pure water are only \u223c250\u2009000\u2005K\u2005s",

        "Abstract": "The type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR)/calcium release channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is required for skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling and is the largest known ion channel, composed of four 565-kDa protomers. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of the RyR have primarily used detergent to solubilize the channel; in the present study, we have used cryo-EM to solve high-resolution structures of the channel in liposomes using a gel-filtration approach with on-column detergent removal to form liposomes and incorporate the channel simultaneously. This allowed us to resolve the structure of the channel in the primed and open states at 3.4 and 4.0\u00a0\u00c5, respectively, with a single dataset. This method offers validation for detergent-based structures of the RyR and offers a starting point for utilizing a chemical gradient mimicking the SR, where Ca",

        "Abstract": "Wnts are evolutionarily conserved ligands that signal at short range to regulate morphogenesis, cell fate, and stem cell renewal. The first and essential steps in Wnt secretion are their O-palmitoleation and subsequent loading onto the dedicated transporter Wntless/evenness interrupted (WLS/Evi). We report the 3.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of palmitoleated human WNT8A in complex with WLS. This is accompanied by biochemical experiments to probe the physiological implications of the observed association. The WLS membrane domain has close structural homology to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). A Wnt hairpin inserts into a conserved hydrophobic cavity in the GPCR-like domain, and the palmitoleate protrudes between two helices into the bilayer. A conformational switch of highly conserved residues on a separate Wnt hairpin might contribute to its transfer to receiving cells. This work provides molecular-level insights into a central mechanism in animal body plan development and stem cell biology.",

        "Abstract": "PfSERA5, a significantly abundant protein present within the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and essential for normal growth during the blood-stage life cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, displays structural similarity to many other cysteine proteases. However, PfSERA5 does not exhibit any detectable protease activity and therefore the role of the PfSERA5 papain-like domain (PfSERA5E), thought to remain bound to its cognate prodomain, remains unknown. In this study, we present a revised structure of the central PfSERA5E domain at a resolution of 1.2 \u00c5, and the first structure of the \"zymogen\" of this papain-like domain including its cognate prodomain (PfSERA5PE) to 2.2 \u00c5 resolution. PfSERA5PE is somewhat structurally similar to that of other known proenzymes, retaining the conserved overall folding and orientation of the prodomain through, and occluding, the archetypal papain-like catalytic triad \"active-site\" cleft, in the same reverse direction as conventional prodomains. Our findings are congruent with previously identified structures of PfSERA5E and of similar \"zymogens\" and provide a foundation for further investigation into the function of PfSERA5.",

        "Abstract": "Arabinosyltransferase B (EmbB) belongs to a family of membrane-bound glycosyltransferases that build the lipidated polysaccharides of the mycobacterial cell envelope, and are targets of anti-tuberculosis drug ethambutol. We present the 3.3\u2009\u00c5 resolution single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure of Mycobacterium smegmatis EmbB, providing insights on substrate binding and reaction mechanism. Mutations that confer ethambutol resistance map mostly around the putative active site, suggesting this to be the location of drug binding.",

        "Abstract": "In mycobacteria, phosphatidylinositol (PI) acts as a common lipid anchor for key components of the cell wall, including the glycolipids phosphatidylinositol mannoside, lipomannan, and lipoarabinomannan. Glycolipids in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, are important virulence factors that modulate the host immune response. The identity-defining step in PI biosynthesis in prokaryotes, unique to mycobacteria and few other bacterial species, is the reaction between cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol and inositol-phosphate to yield phosphatidylinositol-phosphate, the immediate precursor to PI. This reaction is catalyzed by the cytidine diphosphate-alcohol phosphotransferase phosphatidylinositol-phosphate synthase (PIPS), an essential enzyme for mycobacterial viability. Here we present structures of PIPS from Mycobacterium kansasii with and without evidence of donor and acceptor substrate binding obtained using a crystal engineering approach. PIPS from Mycobacterium kansasii is 86% identical to the ortholog from M. tuberculosis and catalytically active. Functional experiments guided by our structural results allowed us to further characterize the molecular determinants of substrate specificity and catalysis in a new mycobacterial species. This work provides a framework to strengthen our understanding of phosphatidylinositol-phosphate biosynthesis in the context of mycobacterial pathogens.",

        "Abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes tuberculosis, a disease that kills over 1 million people each year. Its cell envelope is a common antibiotic target and has a unique structure due, in part, to two lipidated polysaccharides-arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan. Arabinofuranosyltransferase D (AftD) is an essential enzyme involved in assembling these glycolipids. We present the 2.9-\u00c5 resolution structure of M.\u00a0abscessus AftD, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. AftD has a conserved GT-C glycosyltransferase fold and three carbohydrate-binding modules. Glycan array analysis shows that AftD binds complex arabinose glycans. Additionally, AftD is non-covalently complexed with an acyl carrier protein (ACP). 3.4- and 3.5-\u00c5 structures of a mutant with impaired ACP binding reveal a conformational change, suggesting that ACP may regulate AftD function. Mutagenesis experiments using a conditional knockout constructed in M.\u00a0smegmatis confirm the essentiality of the putative active site and the ACP binding for AftD function.",

        "Abstract": "STRA6 (stimulated by retinoic acid 6) is a 75kDa polytopic transmembrane protein that facilitates cellular retinol uptake from retinol-binding protein (RBP). Structural characterization of STRA6 from Danio rerio purified in detergent and reconstituted in amphipol A8-35 was achieved by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This provided the first high-resolution snapshot of this protein, showing a novel topology of a tightly assembled homodimer, and an unexpected physiological association with calmodulin in addition to insights into its potential mechanism of function. Specifically, a large hydrophobic cavity in the center of STRA6 linked to the known site of interaction with RBP suggested a route of retinol entry into the cell by diffusion into the membrane through a lateral opening of the cavity directly into the bilayer. Moreover, the capability to produce pure and homogeneous protein has allowed previously unattainable functional characterization of STRA6 in a reconstituted system. Here, we describe detailed methods for Danio rerio STRA6 expression in insect cells, purification in detergent and reconstitution in amphipol for structural characterization by cryo-EM. Furthermore, we show reconstitution of the protein in liposomes for an in vitro proteoliposome-based assay of STRA6-mediated retinol uptake. Finally, we present methods and preliminary cryo-EM data for STRA6 incorporated in lipid-filled nanodiscs, a close to native milieu to study membrane protein structure and function.",

        "Title": "Intracellular calcium leak as a therapeutic target for RYR1-related myopathies.",
        "Abstract": "RYR1 encodes the type 1 ryanodine receptor, an intracellular calcium release channel (RyR1) on the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Pathogenic RYR1 variations can destabilize RyR1 leading to calcium leak causing oxidative overload and myopathy. However, the effect of RyR1 leak has not been established in individuals with RYR1-related myopathies (RYR1-RM), a broad spectrum of rare neuromuscular disorders. We sought to determine whether RYR1-RM affected individuals exhibit pathologic, leaky RyR1 and whether variant location in the channel structure can predict pathogenicity. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from 17 individuals with RYR1-RM. Mutant RyR1 from these individuals exhibited pathologic SR calcium leak and increased activity of calcium-activated proteases. The increased calcium leak and protease activity were normalized by ex-vivo treatment with S107, a RyR stabilizing Rycal molecule. Using the cryo-EM structure of RyR1 and a new dataset of\u2009>\u20092200 suspected RYR1-RM affected individuals we developed a method for assigning pathogenicity probabilities to RYR1 variants based on 3D co-localization of known pathogenic variants. This study provides the rationale for a clinical trial testing Rycals in RYR1-RM affected individuals and introduces a predictive tool for investigating the pathogenicity of RYR1 variants of uncertain significance.",

        "Abstract": "Classically, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are thought to activate G protein from the plasma membrane and are subsequently desensitized by \u03b2-arrestin (\u03b2-arr). However, some GPCRs continue to signal through G protein from internalized compartments, mediated by a GPCR-G protein-\u03b2-arr 'megaplex'. Nevertheless, the molecular architecture of the megaplex remains unknown. Here, we present its cryo-electron microscopy structure, which shows simultaneous engagement of human G protein and bovine \u03b2-arr to the core and phosphorylated tail, respectively, of a single active human chimeric \u03b2",

        "Abstract": "Recent work has pushed the noise-limited bandwidths of solid-state nanopore conductance recordings to more than 5 MHz and of ion channel conductance recordings to more than 500 kHz through the use of integrated complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits. Despite the spectral spread of the pulse-like signals that characterize these recordings when a sinusoidal basis is employed, Bessel filters are commonly used to denoise these signals to acceptable signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the cost of losing many of the faster temporal features. Here, we report improvements to the SNR that can be achieved using wavelet denoising instead of Bessel filtering. When combined with state-of-the-art high-bandwidth CMOS recording instrumentation, we can reduce baseline noise levels by over a factor of 4 compared to a 2.5 MHz Bessel filter while retaining transient properties in the signal comparable to this filter bandwidth. Similarly, for ion-channel recordings, we achieve a temporal response better than a 100 kHz Bessel filter with a noise level comparable to that achievable with a 25 kHz Bessel filter. Improvements in SNR can be used to achieve robust statistical analyses of these recordings, which may provide important insights into nanopore translocation dynamics and mechanisms of ion-channel function.",

Typically, such recordings are performed at bandwidths of less than 10 kHz because of signal-to-noise considerations, limiting the temporal resolution available for studying fast gating dynamics to greater than 100 \u00b5s. Here we present experimental methods that directly integrate suspended lipid bilayers with high-bandwidth, low-noise transimpedance amplifiers based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits (IC) technology to achieve bandwidths in excess of 500 kHz and microsecond temporal resolution. We use this CMOS-integrated bilayer system to study the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1), a Ca",

        "Abstract": "The membrane-water interface forms a uniquely heterogeneous and geometrically constrained environment for enzymatic catalysis. Integral membrane enzymes sample three environments - the uniformly hydrophobic interior of the membrane, the aqueous extramembrane region, and the fuzzy, amphipathic interfacial region formed by the tightly packed headgroups of the components of the lipid bilayer. Depending on the nature of the substrates and the location of the site of chemical modification, catalysis may occur in each of these environments. The availability of structural information for alpha-helical enzyme families from each of these classes, as well as several beta-barrel enzymes from the bacterial outer membrane, has allowed us to review here the different ways in which each enzyme fold has adapted to the nature of the substrates, products, and the unique environment of the membrane. Our focus here is on enzymes that process lipidic substrates. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Bacterial Lipids edited by Russell E. Bishop.",

Here, we present cryo-EM reconstructions of RyR1 in multiple functional states revealing the structural basis of channel gating and ligand-dependent activation. Binding sites for the channel activators Ca(2+), ATP, and caffeine were identified at interdomain interfaces of the C-terminal domain. Either ATP or Ca(2+) alone induces conformational changes in the cytoplasmic assembly (\"priming\"), without pore dilation. In contrast, in the presence of all three activating ligands, high-resolution reconstructions of open and closed states of RyR1 were obtained from the same sample, enabling analyses of conformational changes associated with\u00a0gating. Gating involves global conformational changes in the cytosolic assembly accompanied by local changes in the transmembrane domain, which include bending of the S6 transmembrane segment and consequent pore dilation, displacement, and deformation of the S4-S5 linker and conformational changes in the pseudo-voltage-sensor domain.",

        "Abstract": "Vitamin A homeostasis is critical to normal cellular function. Retinol-binding protein (RBP) is the sole specific carrier in the bloodstream for hydrophobic retinol, the main form in which vitamin A is transported. The integral membrane receptor STRA6 mediates cellular uptake of vitamin A by recognizing RBP-retinol to trigger release and internalization of retinol. We present the structure of zebrafish STRA6 determined to 3.9-angstrom resolution by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. STRA6 has one intramembrane and nine transmembrane helices in an intricate dimeric assembly. Unexpectedly, calmodulin is bound tightly to STRA6 in a noncanonical arrangement. Residues involved with RBP binding map to an archlike structure that covers a deep lipophilic cleft. This cleft is open to the membrane, suggesting a possible mode for internalization of retinol through direct diffusion into the lipid bilayer.",

        "Abstract": "Polymyxins are antibiotics used in the last line of defense to combat multidrug-resistant infections by Gram-negative bacteria. Polymyxin resistance arises through charge modification of the bacterial outer membrane with the attachment of the cationic sugar 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose to lipid A, a reaction catalyzed by the integral membrane lipid-to-lipid glycosyltransferase 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose transferase (ArnT). Here, we report crystal structures of ArnT from Cupriavidus metallidurans, alone and in complex with the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate, at 2.8 and 3.2 angstrom resolution, respectively. The structures show cavities for both lipidic substrates, which converge at the active site. A structural rearrangement occurs on undecaprenyl phosphate binding, which stabilizes the active site and likely allows lipid A binding. Functional mutagenesis experiments based on these structures suggest a mechanistic model for ArnT family enzymes.",

        "Abstract": "The attachment of a sugar to a hydrophobic polyisoprenyl carrier is the first step for all extracellular glycosylation processes. The enzymes that perform these reactions, polyisoprenyl-glycosyltransferases (PI-GTs) include dolichol phosphate mannose synthase (DPMS), which generates the mannose donor for glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we report the 3.0 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of GtrB, a glucose-specific PI-GT from Synechocystis, showing a tetramer in which each protomer contributes two helices to a membrane-spanning bundle. The active site is 15 \u00c5 from the membrane, raising the question of how water-soluble and membrane-embedded substrates are brought into apposition for catalysis. A conserved juxtamembrane domain harbours disease mutations, which compromised activity in GtrB in vitro and in human DPM1 tested in zebrafish. We hypothesize a role of this domain in shielding the polyisoprenyl-phosphate for transport to the active site. Our results reveal the basis of PI-GT function, and provide a potential molecular explanation for DPM1-related disease.",

        "Abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol is critical for intracellular signalling and anchoring of carbohydrates and proteins to outer cellular membranes. The defining step in phosphatidylinositol biosynthesis is catalysed by CDP-alcohol phosphotransferases, transmembrane enzymes that use CDP-diacylglycerol as donor substrate for this reaction, and either inositol in eukaryotes or inositol phosphate in prokaryotes as the acceptor alcohol. Here we report the structures of a related enzyme, the phosphatidylinositol-phosphate synthase from Renibacterium salmoninarum, with and without bound CDP-diacylglycerol to 3.6 and 2.5 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. These structures reveal the location of the acceptor site, and the molecular determinants of substrate specificity and catalysis. Functional characterization of the 40%-identical ortholog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a potential target for the development of novel anti-tuberculosis drugs, supports the proposed mechanism of substrate binding and catalysis. This work therefore provides a structural and functional framework to understand the mechanism of phosphatidylinositol-phosphate biosynthesis.",

        "Abstract": "Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) mediate the rapid release of calcium (Ca(2+)) from intracellular stores into the cytosol, which is essential for numerous cellular functions including excitation-contraction coupling in muscle. Lack of sufficient structural detail has impeded understanding of RyR gating and regulation. Here we report the closed-state structure of the 2.3-megadalton complex of the rabbit skeletal muscle type 1 RyR (RyR1), solved by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at an overall resolution of 4.8\u00a0\u00c5. We fitted a polyalanine-level model to all 3,757 ordered residues in each protomer, defining the transmembrane pore in unprecedented detail and placing all cytosolic domains as tertiary folds. The cytosolic assembly is built on an extended \u03b1-solenoid scaffold connecting key regulatory domains to the pore. The RyR1 pore architecture places it in the six-transmembrane ion channel superfamily. A unique domain inserted between the second and third transmembrane helices interacts intimately with paired EF-hands originating from the \u03b1-solenoid scaffold, suggesting a mechanism for channel gating by Ca(2+).",

This is an essential reaction for phospholipid biosynthesis across all kingdoms of life, and it is catalysed solely by CDP-APs. Here we report the 2.0 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of a representative CDP-AP from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. The enzyme (AF2299) is a homodimer, with each protomer consisting of six transmembrane helices and an N-terminal cytosolic domain. A polar cavity within the membrane accommodates the active site, lined with the residues from an absolutely conserved CDP-AP signature motif (D(1)xxD(2)G(1)xxAR...G(2)xxxD(3)xxxD(4)). Structures in the apo, CMP-bound, CDP-bound and CDP-glycerol-bound states define functional roles for each of these eight conserved residues and allow us to propose a sequential, base-catalysed mechanism universal for CDP-APs, in which the fourth aspartate (D4) acts as the catalytic base.",

        "Abstract": "Cell membranes present a naturally impervious barrier to aqueous solutes, such that the physiochemical environment on either side of the lipid bilayer can substantially differ. Integral membrane proteins are embedded in this heterogeneous lipid environment, wherein the juxtaposition of apolar and polar molecular surfaces defines factors such as transverse orientation, the surface area available for oligomerisation and the symmetry of resultant assemblies. This chapter focuses on potassium channels -representative molecular pores that play a critical role in electrical signalling by enabling selective transport of K(+) ions across cell membranes. Oligomerization is central to K(+) channel action; individual subunits are nonfunctional and conduction, selectivity and gating involve manipulation of the common subunit interface of the tetramer. Regulation of channel activity can be viewed from the perspective that the pore of K(+) channels has coopted other proteins, utilizing a process of hetero-oligomerisation to absorb new functions that both enable the pore to respond to extrinsic signals and provide an electrical signature.",

        "Abstract": "Invasion of human red blood cells by Plasmodium falciparum involves interaction of the merozoite form through proteins on the surface coat. The erythrocyte binding-like protein family functions after initial merozoite interaction by binding via the Duffy binding-like (DBL) domain to receptors on the host red blood cell. The merozoite surface proteins DBL1 and -2 (PfMSPDBL1 and PfMSPDBL2) (PF10_0348 and PF10_0355) are extrinsically associated with the merozoite, and both have a DBL domain in each protein. We expressed and refolded recombinant DBL domains for PfMSPDBL1 and -2 and show they are functional. The red cell binding characteristics of these domains were shown to be similar to full-length forms of these proteins isolated from parasite cultures. Futhermore, metal cofactors were found to enhance the binding of both the DBL domains and the parasite-derived full-length proteins to erythrocytes, which has implications for receptor binding of other DBL-containing proteins in Plasmodium spp. We solved the structure of the erythrocyte-binding DBL domain of PfMSPDBL2 to 2.09 \u00c5 resolution and modeled that of PfMSPDBL1, revealing a canonical DBL fold consisting of a boomerang shaped \u03b1-helical core formed from three subdomains. PfMSPDBL2 is highly polymorphic, and mapping of these mutations shows they are on the surface, predominantly in the first two domains. For both PfMSPDBL proteins, polymorphic variation spares the cleft separating domains 1 and 2 from domain 3, and the groove between the two major helices of domain 3 extends beyond the cleft, indicating these regions are functionally important and are likely to be associated with the binding of a receptor on the red blood cell.",

        "Title": "Evaluation of diverse \u03b1/\u03b2-backbone patterns for functional \u03b1-helix mimicry: analogues of the Bim BH3 domain.",
        "Abstract": "Peptidic oligomers that contain both \u03b1- and \u03b2-amino acid residues, in regular patterns throughout the backbone, are emerging as structural mimics of \u03b1-helix-forming conventional peptides (composed exclusively of \u03b1-amino acid residues). Here we describe a comprehensive evaluation of diverse \u03b1/\u03b2-peptide homologues of the Bim BH3 domain in terms of their ability to bind to the BH3-recognition sites on two partner proteins, Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1. These proteins are members of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, and both bind tightly to the Bim BH3 domain itself. All \u03b1/\u03b2-peptide homologues retain the side-chain sequence of the Bim BH3 domain, but each homologue contains periodic \u03b1-residue \u2192 \u03b2(3)-residue substitutions. Previous work has shown that the \u03b1\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b1\u03b1\u03b2 pattern, which aligns the \u03b2(3)-residues in a 'stripe' along one side of the helix, can support functional \u03b1-helix mimicry, and the results reported here strengthen this conclusion. The present study provides the first evaluation of functional mimicry by \u03b1\u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b1\u03b1\u03b1\u03b2 patterns, which cause the \u03b2(3)-residues to spiral around the helix periphery. We find that the \u03b1\u03b1\u03b1\u03b2 pattern can support effective mimicry of the Bim BH3 domain, as manifested by the crystal structure of an \u03b1/\u03b2-peptide bound to Bcl-x(L), affinity for a variety of Bcl-2 family proteins, and induction of apoptotic signaling in mouse embryonic fibroblast extracts. The best \u03b1\u03b1\u03b1\u03b2 homologue shows substantial protection from proteolytic degradation relative to the Bim BH3 \u03b1-peptide.",

        "Title": "Minimal requirements for actin filament disassembly revealed by structural analysis of malaria parasite actin-depolymerizing factor 1.",
        "Abstract": "Malaria parasite cell motility is a process that is dependent on the dynamic turnover of parasite-derived actin filaments. Despite its central role, actin's polymerization state is controlled by a set of identifiable regulators that is markedly reduced compared with those of other eukaryotic cells. In Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent species that affects humans, this minimal repertoire includes two members of the actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin (AC) family of proteins, P. falciparum actin-depolymerizing factor 1 (PfADF1) and P. falciparum actin-depolymerizing factor 2. This essential class of actin regulator is involved in the control of filament dynamics at multiple levels, from monomer binding through to filament depolymerization and severing. Previous biochemical analyses have suggested that PfADF1 sequesters monomeric actin but, unlike most eukaryotic counterparts, has limited potential to bind or depolymerize filaments. The molecular basis for these unusual properties and implications for parasite cell motility have not been established. Here we present the crystal structure of an apicomplexan AC protein, PfADF1. We show that PfADF1 lacks critical residues previously implicated as essential for AC-mediated actin filament binding and disassembly, having a substantially reduced filament-binding loop and C-terminal \u03b14 helix. Despite this divergence in structure, we demonstrate that PfADF1 is capable of efficient actin filament severing. Furthermore, this severing occurs despite PfADF1's low binding affinity for filaments. Comparative structural analysis along with biochemical and microscopy evidence establishes that severing is reliant on the availability of an exposed basic residue in the filament-binding loop, a conserved minimal requirement that defines AC-mediated filament disassembly across eukaryotic cells.",

Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a Bcl-2-regulated apoptosis pathway in Schistosoma japonicum and S. mansoni. Genomic, biochemical, and cell-based mechanistic studies provide evidence for a tripartite pathway, similar to that in humans including BH3-only proteins that are inhibited by prosurvival Bcl-2-like molecules, and Bax/Bak-like proteins that facilitate mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization. Because Bcl-2 proteins have been successfully targeted with \"BH3 mimetic\" drugs, particularly in the treatment of cancer, we investigated whether schistosome apoptosis pathways could provide targets for future antischistosomal drug discovery efforts. Accordingly, we showed that a schistosome prosurvival protein, sjA, binds ABT-737, a well-characterized BH3 mimetic. A crystal structure of sjA bound to a BH3 peptide provides direct evidence for the feasibility of developing BH3 mimetics to target Bcl-2 prosurvival proteins in schistosomes, suggesting an alternative application for this class of drugs beyond cancer treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Potassium channels embedded in cell membranes employ gates to regulate K+ current. While a specific constriction in the permeation pathway has historically been implicated in gating, recent reports suggest that the signature ion selectivity filter located in the outer membrane leaflet may be equally important. Inwardly rectifying K+ channels also control the directionality of flow, using intracellular polyamines to stem ion efflux by a valve-like action. This study presents crystallographic evidence of interdependent gates in the conduction pathway and reveals the mechanism of polyamine block. Reorientation of the intracellular domains, concomitant with activation, instigates polyamine release from intracellular binding sites to block the permeation pathway. Conformational adjustments of the slide helices, achieved by rotation of the cytoplasmic assembly relative to the pore, are directly correlated to the ion configuration in the selectivity filter. Ion redistribution occurs irrespective of the constriction, suggesting a more expansive role of the selectivity filter in gating than previously appreciated.",

        "Title": "Metal binding affinities of Arabidopsis zinc and copper transporters: selectivities match the relative, but not the absolute, affinities of their amino-terminal domains.",
        "Abstract": "HMA2, HMA4, and HMA7 are three of the eight heavy metal transporting P(1B)-type ATPases in the simple plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The first two transport Zn(2+), and the third transports Cu(+). Each protein contains soluble N-terminal metal-binding domains (MBDs) that are essential for metal transport. While the MBD of HMA7 features a CxxC sequence motif characteristic of Cu(I) binding sites, those of HMA2 and HMA4 contain a CCxxE motif, unique for plant Zn(2+)-ATPases. The three MBDs HMA2n (residues 1-79), HMA4n (residues 1-96), and HMA7n (residues 56-127) and an HMA7/4n chimera were expressed in Escherichia coli. The chimera features the ICCTSE motif from HMA4n inserted in place of the native MTCAAC motif of HMA7n. Binding affinities for Zn(II) and Cu(I) of each MBD were determined by ligand competition with a number of chromophoric probes. The challenges of using these probes reliably were evaluated, and the relative affinities of the MBDs were verified by independent cross-checks. The affinities of HMA2n and HMA4n for Zn(II) are higher than that of HMA7n by a factor of 20-30, but the relative affinities for Cu(I) are inverted by a factor of 30-50. These relativities are consistent with their respective roles in metal selection and transportation. Chimera HMA7/4n binds Cu(I) with an affinity between those of HMA4n and HMA7n but binds Zn(II) more weakly than either parent protein does. The four MBDs bind Cu(I) more strongly than Zn(II) by factors of >10(6). It is apparent that the individual MBDs are not able to overcome the large thermodynamic preference for Cu(+) over Zn(2+). This information highlights the potential toxicity of Cu(+) in vivo and why copper sensor proteins are approximately 6 orders of magnitude more sensitive than zinc sensor proteins. Metal speciation must be controlled by multiple factors, including thermodynamics (affinity), kinetics (including protein-protein interactions), and compartmentalization. The structure of Zn(II)-bound HMA4n defined by NMR confirmed the predicted ferredoxin betaalphabetabetaalphabeta fold. A single Zn atom was modeled onto a metal-binding site with protein ligands comprising the two thiolates and the carboxylate of the CCxxE motif. The observed (113)Cd chemical shift in [(113)Cd]HMA4n was consistent with a Cd(II)S(2)OX (X = O or N) coordination sphere. The Zn(II) form of the Cu(I) transporter HMA7n is a monomer in solution but crystallized as a polymeric chain [(Zn(II)-HMA7n)(m)]. Each Zn(II) ion occupied a distorted tetrahedral site formed from two Cys ligands of the CxxC motif of one HMA7n molecule and the amino N and carbonyl O atoms of the N-terminal methionine of another.",

        "Abstract": "The sera genes of the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium encode a family of unique proteins that are maximally expressed at the time of egress of parasites from infected red blood cells. These multi-domain proteins are unique, containing a central papain-like cysteine-protease fragment enclosed between the disulfide-linked N- and C-terminal domains. However, the central fragment of several members of this family, including serine repeat antigen 5 (SERA5), contains a serine (S596) in place of the active-site cysteine. Here we report the crystal structure of the central protease-like domain of Plasmodium falciparum SERA5, revealing a number of anomalies in addition to the putative nucleophilic serine: (1) the structure of the putative active site is not conducive to binding substrate in the canonical cysteine-protease manner; (2) the side chain of D594 restricts access of substrate to the putative active site; and (3) the S(2) specificity pocket is occupied by the side chain of Y735, reducing this site to a small depression on the protein surface. Attempts to determine the structure in complex with known inhibitors were not successful. Thus, despite having revealed its structure, the function of the catalytic domain of SERA5 remains an enigma.",

        "Abstract": "Cross-beta amyloid is implicated in over 20 human diseases. Experiments suggest that specific sequence elements within amyloidogenic proteins play a major role in seeding amyloid formation. Identifying these seeding sequences is important for rationalizing the molecular mechanisms of amyloid formation and for elaborating therapeutic strategies that target amyloid. Theoretical techniques play an important role in facilitating the identification and structural characterization of putative seeding sequences; most amyloid species are not amenable to high resolution experimental structure techniques. In this study we have combined a coarse-grained physicochemical protein model with a highly efficient Monte Carlo sampling technique to identify amyloidogenic sequences in four proteins for which respective experimental peptide fragmentation data exist. Peptide sequences were defined as amyloidogenic if the ensemble structure predicted for three interacting peptides described a stable and regular three-stranded beta-sheet. For such peptides, free energies were calculated to provide a measure of amyloid propensity. The overall agreement between the experimental and predicted data is good, and we correctly identify several self-recognition motifs proposed to define the cross-beta amyloid fibril architectures of two of the proteins. Our results compare very favorably with those obtained using atomistic molecular dynamics methods, though our simulations are 30-40 times faster.",

        "Abstract": "Energy-based methods for calculating time-averaged peptide structures are important for rational peptide design, for defining local structure propensities in large protein chains, and for exploring the sequence determinants of amyloid formation. High-end methods are currently too slow to be practicable, and will remain so for the foreseeable future. The challenge is to create a method that runs quickly on limited computer resources and emulates reality sufficiently well. We have developed a simplified off-lattice protein model, incorporating semi-empirical physicochemical potentials, and combined it with an efficient Monte Carlo method for calculating time-averaged peptide structures. Reasonably accurate predictions are found for a set of small alpha-helical and beta-hairpin peptides, and we demonstrate a potential application in measuring local structure propensities in protein chains. Time-averaged structures have also been calculated for a set of small peptides known to form beta-amyloid fibrils. The simulations were of three interacting peptides, and in each case the time-averaged structure describes a three-stranded beta-sheet. The performance of our method in measuring the propensities of small peptides to self-associate into possible prefibrillar species compares favorably with more detailed and CPU-intensive approaches.",

        "Abstract": "The duck-billed platypus has five pairs of sex chromosomes, but there is no information about the primary sex-determining switch in this species. As there is no apparent SRY orthologue in platypus, another gene must acquire the function of a key regulator of the gonadal male or female fate. SOX9 was ruled out from being this key regulator as it maps to an autosome in platypus. To check whether other genes in mammalian gonadogenesis could be the primary switch in monotremes, we have mapped a number of candidates in platypus. We report here the autosomal location of WT1, SF1, LHX1, LHX9, FGF9, WNT4 and RSPO1 in platypus, thus excluding these from being key regulators of sex determination in this species. We found that GATA4 maps to sex chromosomes Y1 and X2; however, it lies in the pairing region shown by chromosome painting to be homologous, so is unlikely to be either male-specific or differentially dosed in male and female.",

We have sequenced the gene encoding the transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase ERBB2 (also known as HER2 or Neu) from 120 primary lung tumours and identified 4% that have mutations within the kinase domain; in the adenocarcinoma subtype of lung cancer, 10% of cases had mutations. ERBB2 inhibitors, which have so far proved to be ineffective in treating lung cancer, should now be clinically re-evaluated in the specific subset of patients with lung cancer whose tumours carry ERBB2 mutations.",
