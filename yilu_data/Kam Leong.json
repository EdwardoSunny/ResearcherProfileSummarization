        "Abstract": "Galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is one of the most serious risks posed to astronauts during missions to the Moon and Mars. Experimental models capable of recapitulating human physiology are critical to understanding the effects of radiation on human organs and developing radioprotective measures against space travel exposures. The effects of systemic radiation are studied using a multi-organ-on-a-chip (multi-OoC) platform containing engineered tissue models of human bone marrow (site of hematopoiesis and acute radiation damage), cardiac muscle (site of chronic radiation damage) and liver (site of metabolism), linked by vascular circulation with an endothelial barrier separating individual tissue chambers from the vascular perfusate. Following protracted neutron radiation, the most damaging radiation component in deep space, a greater deviation of tissue function is observed as compared to the same cumulative dose delivered acutely. Further, by characterizing engineered bone marrow (eBM)-derived immune cells in circulation, 58 unique genes specific to the effects of protracted neutron dosing are identified, as compared to acutely irradiated and healthy tissues. It propose that this bioengineered platform allows studies of human responses to extended radiation exposure in an \"astronaut-on-a-chip\" model that can inform measures for mitigating cosmic radiation injury.",

        "Abstract": "Combining radiotherapy with immune checkpoint blockade therapy offers a promising approach to treat glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), yet challenges such as limited effectiveness and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) persist. These issues are largely due to the failure in targeting immunomodulators directly to the tumor microenvironment. To address this, a biomimetic nanoplatform that combines a genetically modified mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) membrane with a bioactive nanoparticle core for chemokine-directed radioimmunotherapy of GBM is developed. The CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-overexpressing MSC membrane acts as a tactical tentacle to achieve radiation-induced tropism toward the abundant chemokine (CC motif)\u00a0ligand 2 (CCL2) in irradiated gliomas. The nanoparticle core, comprising diselenide-bridged mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and PD-L1 antibodies (\u03b1PD-L1), enables X-ray-responsive drug release and radiosensitization. In two murine models with orthotopic GBM tumors, this nanoplatform reinvigorated immunogenic cell death, and augmented the efficacy and specificity of GBM radioimmunotherapy, with reduced occurrence of irAEs. This study suggests a promising radiation-induced tropism strategy for targeted drug delivery, and presents a potent nanoplatform that enhances the efficacy and safety of radio-immunotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have recently emerged as successful gene delivery platforms for a diverse array of disease treatments. Efforts to optimize their design for common administration methods such as intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, or inhalation, revolve primarily around the addition of targeting ligands or the choice of ionizable lipid. Here, we employed a multi-step screening method to optimize the type of helper lipid and component ratios in a plasmid DNA (pDNA) LNP library to efficiently deliver pDNA through intraduodenal delivery as an indicative route for oral administration. By addressing different physiological barriers in a stepwise manner, we down-selected effective LNP candidates from a library of over 1000 formulations. Beyond reporter protein expression, we assessed the efficiency in non-viral gene editing in mouse liver mediated by LNPs to knockdown PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 expression, thereby lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Utilizing an all-in-one pDNA construct with Strep. pyogenes Cas9 and gRNAs, our results showcased that intraduodenal administration of selected LNPs facilitated targeted gene knockdown in the liver, resulting in a 27% reduction in the serum LDL cholesterol level. This LNP-based all-in-one pDNA-mediated gene editing strategy highlights its potential as an oral therapeutic approach for hypercholesterolemia, opening up new possibilities for DNA-based gene medicine applications.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the impact of long-term opioid exposure on the embryonic brain is critical due to the surging number of pregnant mothers with opioid dependency. However, this has been limited by human brain inaccessibility and cross-species differences in animal models. Here, a human midbrain model is established that uses hiPSC-derived midbrain organoids to assess cell-type-specific responses to acute and chronic fentanyl treatment and fentanyl withdrawal. Single-cell mRNA sequencing of 25,510 cells from organoids in different treatment groups reveals that chronic fentanyl treatment arrests neuronal subtype specification during early midbrain development and alters synaptic activity and neuron projection. In contrast, acute fentanyl treatment increases dopamine release but does not significantly alter gene expression related to cell lineage development. These results provide the first examination of the effects of opioid exposure on human midbrain development at the single-cell level.",

        "Abstract": "Spatially resolved gene expression profiling provides insight into tissue organization and cell-cell crosstalk; however, sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) lacks single-cell resolution. Current ST analysis methods require single-cell RNA sequencing data as a reference for rigorous interpretation of cell states, mostly do not use associated histology images and are not capable of inferring shared neighborhoods across multiple tissues. Here we present Starfysh, a computational toolbox using a deep generative model that incorporates archetypal analysis and any known cell type markers to characterize known or new tissue-specific cell states without a single-cell reference. Starfysh improves the characterization of spatial dynamics in complex tissues using histology images and enables the comparison of niches as spatial hubs across tissues. Integrative analysis of primary estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) tissues led to the identification of spatial hubs with patient- and disease-specific cell type compositions and revealed metabolic reprogramming shaping immunosuppressive hubs in aggressive MBC.",

High levels of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) were detected in the inflammatory microenvironment of these diseases, which are closely associated with persistent uncontrolled neutrophilic inflammation. Although DNase has proven to be effective in mitigating neutrophilic airway inflammation in mice by reducing cfDNA and NET levels, its clinical use is hindered by severe side effects. Here, we synthesized polyglycerol-amine (PGA) with a series of hydroxyl/amine ratios and covered them with black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets.

Here, mucus and biofilm dual-penetrating immunoantimicrobials (IMAMs) are developed for bridging antibacterial therapy and pro-resolving immunotherapy of COPD. IMAMs are constructed from ceftazidime (CAZ)-encapsulated hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSNs) gated with a charge/conformation-transformable polypeptide. The polypeptide adopts a negatively charged, random-coiled conformation, masking the pores of HMSNs to prevent antibiotic leakage and allowing the nebulized IMAMs to efficiently penetrate the bronchial mucus and biofilm. Inside the acidic biofilm, the polypeptide transforms into a cationic and rigid \u03b1 helix, enhancing biofilm retention and unmasking the pores to release CAZ. Meanwhile, the polypeptide is conditionally activated to disrupt bacterial membranes and scavenge bacterial DNA, functioning as an adjuvant of CAZ to eradicate lung-colonizing bacteria and inhibiting Toll-like receptor 9 activation to foster inflammation resolution. This immunoantibacterial strategy may shift the current paradigm of COPD management.",

        "Abstract": "Conventionally, nanocarriers are used to regulate the controlled release of therapeutic payloads. Increasingly, they can also be designed to have an intrinsic therapeutic effect. For example, a positively charged nanocarrier can bind damage-associated molecular patterns, inhibiting toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway activation and thus modulating inflammation. These nucleic acid-binding nanomaterials (NABNs), which scavenge pro-inflammatory stimuli, exist in diverse forms, ranging from soluble polymers to nanoparticles and 2D nanosheets. Unlike conventional drugs that primarily address inflammation symptoms, these NABPs target the upstream inflammation initiation pathway by removing the agonists responsible for inflammation. Many NABNs have demonstrated effectiveness in murine models of inflammatory diseases. However, these scavengers have not been systematically studied and compared within a single setting. Herein, we screen a subset of the most potent NABNs to define their relative efficiency in scavenging cell-free nucleic acids and inhibiting various TLR pathways. This study helps interpret existing in vivo results and provides insights into the future design of anti-inflammatory nanocarriers.",

        "Abstract": "The effects of immunotherapeutics on interactions between immune and cancer cells are modulated by multiple components in the tumour microenvironment (TME), including endothelium and tumour stroma, which provide both a physical barrier and immunosuppressive stimuli. Herein, we report a recirculating chip to enable continuous immune cell recirculation through a microfluidic cell array to include these crucial players. This system consists of a three-layered cell array (\u03bcFCA) spatially emulating the TME, with tailored fluidic circuits establishing T cell recirculation. This platform enables the study of dynamics among the TME, immune cells in a circulatory system and cancer cell responses thereof. Through this system, we found that tumour endothelium hindered T cell infiltration into the reconstructed breast cancer tumour compartment. This negative effect was alleviated when treated with anti-human PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) antibody. Another key stromal component - cancer associated fibroblasts - attenuated T cell infiltration, compared against normal fibroblasts, and led to reduced apoptotic activity in cancer cells. These results confirm the capability of our tumour-on-a-chip system in identifying some key axes to target in overcoming barriers to immunotherapy by recapitulating immune cell interactions with the reconstructed TME. Our results also attest to the feasibility of scaling up this system for high-throughput cancer immunotherapeutic screening.",

        "Title": "Multifunctional Cationic Hyperbranched Polyaminoglycosides that Target Multiple Mediators for Severe Abdominal Trauma Management.",
        "Abstract": "Trauma and its associated complications, including dysregulated inflammatory responses, severe infection, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), continue to pose lethal threats worldwide. Following injury, cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs), categorized as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), are released from dying or dead cells, triggering local and systemic inflammatory responses and coagulation abnormalities that worsen disease progression. Harnessing cfNA scavenging strategies with biomaterials has emerged as a promising approach for treating posttrauma systemic inflammation. In this study, the effectiveness of cationic hyperbranched polyaminoglycosides derived from tobramycin (HPT) and disulfide-included HPT (ss-HPT) in scavenging cfNAs to mitigate posttrauma inflammation and hypercoagulation is investigated. Both cationic polymers demonstrate the ability to suppress DAMP-induced toll-like receptor (TLR) activation, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and hypercoagulation by efficiently scavenging cfNAs. Additionally, HPT and ss-HPT exhibit potent antibacterial efficacy attributed to the presence of tobramycin in their chemical composition. Furthermore, HPT and ss-HPT exhibit favorable modulatory effects on inflammation and therapeutic outcomes in a cecal ligation puncture (CLP) mouse abdominal trauma model. Notably, in vivo studies reveal that ss-HPT displayed high accumulation and retention in injured organs of traumatized mice while maintaining a higher biodegradation rate in healthy mice, contrasting with findings for HPT. Thus, functionalized ss-HPT, a bioreducible polyaminoglycoside, holds promise as an effective option to enhance therapeutic outcomes for trauma patients by alleviating posttrauma inflammation and coagulation complications.",

        "Abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and complex inflammatory disorder that is frequently compounded by cartilage degradation, synovial inflammation, and osteophyte formation. Damaged chondrocytes release multiple danger mediators that exacerbate synovial inflammation and accelerate the progression to OA. Conventional treatments targeting only a single mediator of OA have failed to achieve a strong therapeutic effect. Addressing the crucial role of multiple danger mediators in OA progression, we prepared polyethylenimine (PEI)-functionalized diselenide-bridged mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN-PEI) with cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-binding and anti-oxidative properties. In models of surgery-induced and collagenase-induced arthritis, we showed that these cationic nanoparticles attenuated cartilage degradation and provided strong chondroprotection against joint damage. Mechanistically, multiple target blockades alleviated oxidative stress and dampened cfDNA-induced inflammation by suppressing the M1 polarization of macrophages. This study suggests a beneficial direction for targeting multiple danger mediators in the treatment of intractable arthritis.",

        "Title": "Aberrant pace of cortical neuron development in brain organoids from patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and schizophrenia.",
        "Abstract": "Adults and children afflicted with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) exhibit cognitive, social, and emotional impairments, and are at significantly heightened risk for schizophrenia (SCZ). The impact of this deletion on early human brain development, however, has remained unclear. Here we harness organoid models of the developing human cerebral cortex, cultivated from subjects with 22q11.2DS and SCZ, as well as unaffected control samples, to identify cell-type-specific developmental abnormalities arising from this genomic lesion. Leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing in conjunction with experimental validation, we find that the loss of genes within the 22q11.2 locus leads to a delayed development of cortical neurons. This compromised development was reflected in an elevated proportion of actively proliferating neural progenitor cells, coupled with a decreased fraction of more mature neurons. Furthermore, we identify perturbed molecular imprints linked to neuronal maturation, observe the presence of sparser neurites, and note a blunted amplitude in glutamate-induced Ca2+ transients. The aberrant transcription program underlying impaired development contains molecular signatures significantly enriched in neuropsychiatric genetic liability. MicroRNA profiling and target gene investigation suggest that microRNA dysregulation may drive perturbations of genes governing the pace at which maturation unfolds. Using protein-protein interaction network analysis we define complementary effects stemming from additional genes residing within the deleted locus. Our study uncovers reproducible neurodevelopmental and molecular alterations due to 22q11.2 deletions. These findings have the potential to facilitate disease modeling and promote the pursuit of therapeutic interventions.",

        "Title": "PCSK9 activation promotes early atherosclerosis in a vascular microphysiological system.",
        "Abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a primary precursor of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death worldwide. While proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) contributes to CVD by degrading low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) and altering lipid metabolism, PCSK9 also influences vascular inflammation, further promoting atherosclerosis. Here, we utilized a vascular microphysiological system to test the effect of PCSK9 activation or repression on the initiation of atherosclerosis and to screen the efficacy of a small molecule PCSK9 inhibitor. We have generated PCSK9 over-expressed (P+) or repressed (P-) human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and further differentiated them to smooth muscle cells (viSMCs) or endothelial cells (viECs). Tissue-engineered blood vessels (TEBVs) made from P+ viSMCs and viECs resulted in increased monocyte adhesion compared to the wild type (WT) or P- equivalents when treated with enzyme-modified LDL (eLDL) and TNF-\u03b1. We also found significant viEC dysfunction, such as increased secretion of VCAM-1, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6, in P+ viECs treated with eLDL and TNF-\u03b1. A small molecule compound, NYX-1492, that was originally designed to block PCSK9 binding with the LDLR was tested in TEBVs to determine its effect on lowering PCSK9-induced inflammation. The compound reduced monocyte adhesion in P+ TEBVs with evidence of lowering secretion of VCAM-1 and TNF-\u03b1. These results suggest that PCSK9 inhibition may decrease vascular inflammation in addition to lowering plasma LDL levels, enhancing its anti-atherosclerotic effects, particularly in patients with elevated chronic inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "Biologics are unaffordable to a large majority of the global population because of prohibitively expensive fermentation systems, purification and the requirement for cold chain for storage and transportation. Limitations of current production and delivery systems of biologics were evident during the recent pandemic when <2.5% of vaccines produced were available to low-income countries and \u223c19 million doses were discarded in Africa due to lack of cold-chain infrastructure. Among FDA-approved biologics since 2015, >90% are delivered using invasive methods. While oral or topical drugs are highly preferred by patients because of their affordability and convenience, only two oral drugs have been approved by FDA since 2015. A newly launched oral biologic costs only \u223c3% of the average cost of injectable biologics because of the simplified regulatory approval process by elimination of prohibitively expensive fermentation, purification, cold storage/transportation. In addition, the cost of developing a new biologic injectable product (\u223c$2.5 billion) has been dramatically reduced through oral or topical delivery. Topical delivery has the unique advantage of targeted delivery of high concentration protein drugs, without getting diluted in circulating blood. However, only very few topical drugs have been approved by the FDA. Therefore, this review highlights recent advances in oral or topical delivery of proteins at early or advanced stages of human clinical trials using chewing gums, patches or sprays, or nucleic acid drugs directly, or in combination with, nanoparticles and offers future directions.",

        "Abstract": "Cosmic radiation is the most serious risk that will be encountered during the planned missions to the Moon and Mars. There is a compelling need to understand the effects, safety thresholds, and mechanisms of radiation damage in human tissues, in order to develop measures for radiation protection during extended space travel. As animal models fail to recapitulate the molecular changes in astronauts, engineered human tissues and \"organs-on-chips\" are valuable tools for studying effects of radiation in vitro. We have developed a bioengineered tissue platform for studying radiation damage in individualized settings. To demonstrate its utility, we determined the effects of radiation using engineered models of two human tissues known to be radiosensitive: engineered cardiac tissues (eCT, a target of chronic radiation damage) and engineered bone marrow (eBM, a target of acute radiation damage). We report the effects of high-dose neutrons, a proxy for simulated galactic cosmic rays, on the expression of key genes implicated in tissue responses to ionizing radiation, phenotypic and functional changes in both tissues, and proof-of-principle application of radioprotective agents. We further determined the extent of inflammatory, oxidative stress, and matrix remodeling gene expression changes, and found that these changes were associated with an early hypertrophic phenotype in eCT and myeloid skewing in eBM. We propose that individualized models of human tissues have potential to provide insights into the effects and mechanisms of radiation during deep-space missions and allow testing of radioprotective measures.",

Current approaches mainly rely on local injection to bypass the BBB. However, such administration is highly invasive and not amenable to treating certain delicate regions of the brain. We demonstrate a safe and effective gene editing technique by using focused ultrasound (FUS) to transiently open the BBB for the transport of intravenously delivered CRISPR/Cas9 machinery to the brain.",

        "Abstract": "The cell-specific functions of nitric oxide (NO) in the intestinal microenvironment orchestrate its therapeutic effects in ulcerative colitis. While most biomaterials show promise by eliciting the characteristics of NO, the insufficient storage, burst release, and pro-inflammatory side effects of NO remain as challenges. Herein, we report the development of thiol-disulfide hybrid mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (MONs) that improve the storage and sustained release of NO, broadening the therapeutic window of NO-based therapy against colitis. The tailored NO-storing nanomaterials coordinated the release of NO and the immunoregulator dexamethasone (Dex) in the intestinal microenvironment, specifically integrating the alleviation of oxidative stress in enterocytes and the reversal of NO-exacerbated macrophage activation. Mechanistically, such a synchronous operation was achieved by a self-motivated process wherein the thiyl radicals produced by NO release cleaved the disulfide bonds to degrade the matrix and release Dex via thiol-disulfide exchange. Specifically, the MON-mediated combination of NO and Dex greatly ameliorated intractable colitis compared with 5-aminosalicylic acid, even after delayed treatment. Together, our results reveal a key contribution of synergistic modulation of the intestinal microenvironment in NO-based colitis therapy and introduce thiol-disulfide hybrid nanotherapeutics for the management of inflammatory diseases and cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Gene mutations and functional inhibition are the major obstacles for p53-mediated oncotherapy. For p53-wild-type tumors, the underlying mechanisms of functional inhibition of p53 during oncogenesis are unknown. The results reveal that the expression of the MDM2 inhibitor ARF is inhibited in p53-wild-type tumors, indicating that the restoration of ARF could be a potential oncotherapy strategy for p53-wild-type tumors. Therefore, ARF-mimetic MDM2-targeting reassembly peptide nanoparticles (MtrapNPs) for p53-based tumor therapy is developed. The results elucidated that the MtrapNPs respond to and form a nanofiber structure with MDM2. By trapping MDM2, the MtrapNPs stabilize and activate p53 for the inhibition of p53-wild-type tumors. In most cases, reactivated mutant p53 is inhibited and degraded by MDM2. In the present study, MtrapNPs are used to load and deliver arsenic trioxide, a p53 mutation rescuer, for p53-mutated tumor treatment in both orthotopic and metastatic models, and they exhibit significant therapeutic effects. Therefore, the study provides evidence supporting a link between decreased ARF expression and tumor development in patients with p53-wild-type tumors. Thus, the MDM2-trap strategy, which addresses both the inhibition and mutations of p53, is an efficient strategy for the treatment of p53-mutated tumors.",

        "Abstract": "Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is a widely used imaging technique for living and large cleared samples. However, high-performance LSFM systems are often prohibitively expensive and not easily scalable for high-throughput applications. Here, we introduce a cost-effective, scalable, and versatile high-resolution imaging framework, called projected Light Sheet Microscopy (pLSM), which repurposes readily available off-the-shelf consumer-grade components and an over-the-network control architecture to achieve high-resolution imaging of living and cleared samples. We extensively characterize the pLSM framework and showcase its capabilities through high-resolution, multi-color imaging and quantitative analysis of mouse and post-mortem human brain samples cleared using various techniques. Moreover, we show the applicability of pLSM for high-throughput molecular phenotyping of human induced pluripotent cells (iPSC)-derived brain and vessel organoids. Additionally, we utilized pLSM for comprehensive live imaging of bacterial pellicle biofilms at the air-liquid interface, uncovering their intricate layered architecture and diverse cellular dynamics across different depths. Overall, the pLSM framework has the potential to further democratize LSFM by making high-resolution light sheet microscopy more accessible and scalable.",

        "Abstract": "Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is a leading cause of drug-induced liver injury and acute liver failure, while the detection, prognosis prediction, and therapy for APAP-induced liver injury (AILI) remain improved. Here, it is determined that the temporal pattern of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is strongly associated with damage and inflammation parameters in AILI. CfDNA is comparable to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in predicting mortality and outperformed ALT when combined with ALT in AILI. The depletion of cfDNA or neutrophils alleviates liver damage, while the addition of cfDNA or adoptive transfer of neutrophils exacerbates the damage. The combination of DNase I and N-acetylcysteine attenuates AILI significantly. This study establishes that cfDNA is a mechanistic biomarker to predict mortality in AILI mice. The combination of scavenging cfDNA and reducing oxidative damage provides a promising treatment for AILI.",

        "Title": "Inhibition of Abl Kinase by Imatinib Can Rescue the Compromised Barrier Function of 22q11.2DS Patient-iPSC-Derived Blood-Brain Barriers.",
        "Abstract": "We have previously established that the integrity of the induced blood-brain barrier (iBBB) formed by brain microvascular endothelial cells derived from the iPSC of 22q11.2 DS (22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome, also called DiGeorge Syndrome) patients is compromised. We tested the possibility that the haploinsufficiency of CRKL, a gene within the 22q11.2 DS deletion region, contributes to the deficit. The CRKL is a major substrate of the Abl tyrosine kinase, and the Abl/CRKL signaling pathway is critical for endothelial barrier functions. Imatinib, an FDA-approved drug, inhibits Abl kinase and has been used to treat various disorders involving vascular leakages. To test if imatinib can restore the compromised iBBB, we treated the patient's iBBB with imatinib. After treatment, both trans-endothelial electrical resistance and solute permeability returned to comparable levels of the control iBBB. Correspondingly, changes in tight junctions and endothelial glycocalyx of the iBBB were also restored. Western blotting showed that imatinib increased the level of active forms of the CRKL protein. A transcriptome study revealed that imatinib up-regulated genes in the signaling pathways responsible for the protein modification process and down-regulated those for cell cycling. The KEGG pathway analysis further suggested that imatinib improved the gene expression of the CRKL signaling pathway and tight junctions, which agrees with our expectations and the observations at protein levels. Our results indicate that the 22q11.2DS iBBB is at least partially caused by the haploinsufficiency of CRKL, which can be rescued by imatinib via its effects on the Abl/CRKL signaling pathway. Our findings uncover a novel disease mechanism associated with 22q11.2DS.",

        "Abstract": "Effective delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 components is crucial to realizing the therapeutic potential. Although many delivery approaches have been developed for this application, oral delivery has not been explored due to the degradative nature of the gastrointestinal tract. For this issue, we developed a series of novel phenylboronic acid (PBA)-functionalized chitosan-polyethylenimine (CS-PEI) polymers for oral CRISPR delivery. PBA functionalization equipped the polyplex with higher stability, smooth transport across the mucus, and efficient endosomal escape and cytosolic unpackaging in the cells. From a library of 12 PBA-functionalized CS-PEI polyplexes, we identified a formulation that showed the most effective penetration in the intestinal mucosa after oral gavage to mice. The optimized formulation performed feasible CRISPR-mediated downregulation of the target protein and reduction in the downstream cholesterol. As the first oral CRISPR carrier, this study suggests the potential of addressing the needs of both local and systemic editing in a patient-compliant manner.",

The enthesis is prone to injury due to mechanical demands, and it cannot regenerate. A better understanding of how the enthesis develops will lead to more effective therapies to prevent pathology and promote regeneration. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to define the developmental transcriptome of the mouse entheses over postnatal stages. Six resident cell types, including enthesis progenitors and mineralizing chondrocytes, were identified along with their transcription factor regulons and temporal regulation. Following the prior discovery of the necessity of Gli1-lineage cells for mouse enthesis development and healing, we then examined their transcriptomes at single-cell resolution and demonstrated clonogenicity and multipotency of the Gli1-expressing progenitors. Transplantation of Gli1-lineage cells to mouse enthesis injuries improved healing, demonstrating their therapeutic potential for enthesis regeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity is a pandemic health problem with poor solutions, especially for targeted treatment. Here we develop a polycation-based nanomedicine polyamidoamine generation 3 (P-G3) that-when delivered intraperitoneally-selectively targets visceral fat due to its high charge density. Moreover, P-G3 treatment of obese mice inhibits visceral adiposity, increases energy expenditure, prevents obesity and alleviates the associated metabolic dysfunctions. In vitro adipogenesis models and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that P-G3 uncouples adipocyte lipid synthesis and storage from adipocyte development to create adipocytes that possess normal functions but are deficient in hypertrophic growth, at least through synergistically modulating nutrient-sensing signalling pathways. The visceral fat distribution of P-G3 is enhanced by modifying P-G3 with cholesterol to form lipophilic nanoparticles, which is effective in treating obesity. Our study highlights a strategy to target visceral adiposity and suggests that cationic nanomaterials could be exploited for treating metabolic diseases.",

        "Abstract": "As a surging public health crisis, obesity and overweight predispose individuals to various severe comorbidities contributed by the accompanying chronic inflammation. However, few options exist for tackling chronic inflammation in obesity or inhibiting depot-specific adiposity. Here, we report that polycationic polyamidoamine (PAMAM) treatment can improve both aspects of obesity. With the discovery that the plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) level is elevated in obese subjects, we applied the cationic PAMAM generation 3 (P-G3) scavenger to treat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Intraperitoneal delivery of P-G3 alleviated the chronic inflammation in DIO mice and reduced their body weight, resulting in improved metabolic functions. To further enhance the applicability of P-G3, we complexed P-G3 with human serum albumin (HSA) to attain a sustained release, which showed consistent benefits in treating DIO mice. Local injection of HSA-PG3 into subcutaneous fat completely restricted the distribution of the complex within the targeted depot and reduced focal adiposity. Our study illuminates a promising cationic strategy to ameliorate chronic inflammation in obesity and target local adiposity.",

        "Abstract": "Neural stem cells (NSC) have tremendous potential for therapeutic regeneration of diseased or traumatized neural tissues, including injured spinal cord. However, transplanted NSC suffer from low cell survival and uncontrolled differentiation, limiting in vivo efficacy. Here, this issue is tackled by delivery through silk-collagen protein hydrogels that are stiffness-matched, stress-relaxing, and shear-thinning. The mechanically-tuned hydrogels protect NSC reprogrammed from fibroblasts (iNSC) initially from injection shear-stress, and enhance long-term survival over 12 weeks. Hydrogel-iNSC treatment alleviates neural inflammation, with reduced inflammatory cells and lesions than NSC-only. The iNSC migrate from the hydrogel into surrounding tissues, secrete up-regulated neurotrophic factors, and differentiate into neural cell subtypes, forming synapses. More serotonergic axons are observed in the lesion cavity, and locomotor functions are improved in hydrogel-iNSC than in iNSC-only. This study highlights the ability of mechanically-tuned protein hydrogels to protect iNSC from the injection stress and severe inflammatory environment, allowing them to differentiate and function to recover the injured spinal cord.",

        "Abstract": "Photothermal therapy (PTT) is an effective treatment modality that is highly selective for tumor suppression and is a hopeful alternative to traditional cancer therapy. However, PTT-induced inflammatory responses may result in undesirable side effects including increased risks of tumor recurrence and metastasis. Here we developed multifunctional MnO nanoparticles as scavengers of proinflammatory molecules to alleviate the PTT-induced inflammatory response. The MnO nanoparticles improve the PTT therapy by (1) binding and scavenging proinflammatory molecules to inhibit the proinflammatory molecule-induced Toll-like receptors (TLR) activation and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling; (2) inhibiting activated macrophage-induced macrophage recruitment; and (3) inhibiting tumor cell migration and invasion. In vivo experimental results showed that further treatment with MnO nanoparticles after laser therapy not only inhibited the PTT-induced inflammatory response and primary tumor recurrence but also significantly reduced tumor metastasis due to the scavenging activity. These findings suggest that MnO nanoparticles hold the potential for mitigating the therapy-induced severe inflammatory response and inhibiting tumor recurrence and metastasis.",

        "Abstract": "Microbiota-based therapeutics offer innovative strategies to treat inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). However, the poor clinical outcome so far and the limited flexibility of the bacterial approach call for improvement. Inspired by the health benefits of probiotics in alleviating symptoms of bowel diseases, bioartificial probiotics are designed to restore the intestinal microenvironment in colitis by regulating redox balance, immune responses, and the gut microbiome. The bioartificial probiotic comprises two components: an E. coli Nissle 1917-derived membrane (EM) as the surface and the biodegradable diselenide-bridged mesoporous silica nanoparticles (SeM) as the core. When orally administered, the probiotic-inspired nanomedicine (SeM@EM) adheres strongly to the mucus layer and restored intestinal redox balance and immune regulation homeostasis in a murine model of acute colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate. In addition, the respective properties of the EM and SeM synergistically alter the gut microbiome to a favorable state by increasing the bacterial diversity and shifting the microbiome profile to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. This work suggests a safe and effective nanomedicine that can restore intestinal homeostasis for IBDs therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Periodontitis is a common type of inflammatory bone loss and a risk factor for systemic diseases. The pathogenesis of periodontitis involves inflammatory dysregulation, which represents a target for new therapeutic strategies to treat periodontitis. After establishing the correlation of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) level with periodontitis in patient samples, we test the hypothesis that the cfDNA-scavenging approach will benefit periodontitis treatment. We create a nanoparticulate cfDNA scavenger specific for periodontitis by coating selenium-doped hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (SeHANs) with cationic polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM-G3), namely G3@SeHANs, and compare the activities of G3@SeHANs with those of soluble PAMAM-G3 polymer. Both G3@SeHANs and PAMAM-G3 inhibit periodontitis-related proinflammation in vitro by scavenging cfDNA and alleviate inflammatory bone loss in a mouse model of ligature-induced periodontitis. G3@SeHANs also regulate the mononuclear phagocyte system in a periodontitis environment, promoting the M2 over the M1 macrophage phenotype. G3@SeHANs show greater therapeutic effects than PAMAM-G3 in reducing proinflammation and alveolar bone loss in vivo. Our findings demonstrate the importance of cfDNA in periodontitis and the potential for using hydroxyapatite-based nanoparticulate cfDNA scavengers to ameliorate periodontitis.",

        "Abstract": "We propose an ex vivo T cell expansion system that mimics natural antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for adoptive cell therapy (ACT). Microfiber scaffolds coated with dendritic cell (DC) membrane replicate physicochemical properties of dendritic cells specific for T cell activation such as rapid recognition by T cells, long duration of T cell tethering, and DC-specific co-stimulatory cues. The DC membrane-coated scaffold is first surface-immobilized with T cell stimulatory ligands, anti-CD3 (\u03b1CD3) and anti-CD28 (\u03b1CD28) antibodies, followed by adsorption of releasable interleukin-2 (IL-2). The scaffolds present both surface and soluble cues to T cells ex vivo in the same way that these cues are presented by natural APCs in vivo. We demonstrate that the DC-mimicking scaffold promotes greater polyclonal expansion of primary human T cells as compared to \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD28-functionalized Dynabead. More importantly, major histocompatibility complex molecules derived from the DC membrane of the scaffold allow antigen-specific T cell expansion with target cell-specific killing ability. In addition, most of the expanded T cells (\u223c97%) can be harvested from the scaffold by density gradient centrifugation. Overall, the DC-mimicking scaffold offers a scalable, modular, and customizable platform for rapid expansion of highly functional T cells for ACT.",

        "Abstract": "Cell reprogramming can satisfy the demands of obtaining specific cell types for applications such as tissue regeneration and disease modeling. Here we report the reprogramming of human fibroblasts to produce chemically-induced osteogenic cells (ciOG), and explore the potential uses of ciOG in bone repair and disease treatment. A chemical cocktail of RepSox, forskolin, and phenamil was used for osteogenic induction of fibroblasts by activation of RUNX2 expression. Following a maturation, the cells differentiated toward an osteoblast phenotype that produced mineralized nodules. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing identified a distinct ciOG population. ciOG formed mineralized tissue in an ectopic site of immunodeficiency mice, unlike the original fibroblasts. Osteogenic reprogramming was modulated under engineered culture substrates. When generated on a nanofiber substrate ciOG accelerated bone matrix formation in a calvarial defect, indicating that the engineered biomaterial promotes the osteogenic capacity of ciOG in vivo. Furthermore, the ciOG platform recapitulated the genetic bone diseases Proteus syndrome and osteogenesis imperfecta, allowing candidate drug testing. The reprogramming of human fibroblasts into osteogenic cells with a chemical cocktail thus provides a source of specialized cells for use in bone tissue engineering and disease modeling.",

        "Abstract": "Engineered cardiac tissues derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells offer unique opportunities for patient-specific disease modeling, drug discovery and cardiac repair. Since the first engineered hearts were introduced over two decades ago, human induced pluripotent stem cell-based three-dimensional cardiac organoids and heart-on-a-chip systems have now become mainstays in basic cardiovascular research as valuable platforms for investigating fundamental human pathophysiology and development. However, major obstacles remain to be addressed before the field can truly advance toward commercial and clinical translation. Here we provide a snapshot of the state-of-the-art methods in cardiac tissue engineering, with a focus on in vitro models of the human heart. Looking ahead, we discuss major challenges and opportunities in the field and suggest strategies for enabling broad acceptance of engineered cardiac tissues as models of cardiac pathophysiology and testbeds for the development of therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Tremendous progress has been made in the past decade regarding our understanding of the gut microbiome's role in human health. Currently, however, a comprehensive and focused review marrying the two distinct fields of gut microbiome and material research is lacking. To bridge the gap, the current paper discusses critical aspects of the rapidly emerging research topic of \"material engineering in the gut microbiome and human health.\" By engaging scientists with diverse backgrounds in biomaterials, gut-microbiome axis, neuroscience, synthetic biology, tissue engineering, and biosensing in a dialogue, our goal is to accelerate the development of research tools for gut microbiome research and the development of therapeutics that target the gut microbiome. For this purpose, state-of-the-art knowledge is presented here on biomaterial technologies that facilitate the study, analysis, and manipulation of the gut microbiome, including intestinal organoids, gut-on-chip models, hydrogels for spatial mapping of gut microbiome compositions, microbiome biosensors, and oral bacteria delivery systems. In addition, a discussion is provided regarding the microbiome-gut-brain axis and the critical roles that biomaterials can play to investigate and regulate the axis. Lastly, perspectives are provided regarding future directions on how to develop and use novel biomaterials in gut microbiome research, as well as essential regulatory rules in clinical translation. In this way, we hope to inspire research into future biomaterial technologies to advance gut microbiome research and gut microbiome-based theragnostics.",

Our CRISPR-Cas9 nanocapsules can be simply fabricated by encapsulating the single Cas9/sgRNA complex within a glutathione-sensitive polymer shell incorporating a dual-action ligand that facilitates BBB penetration, tumor cell targeting, and Cas9/sgRNA selective release. Our encapsulating nanocapsules evidenced promising glioblastoma tissue targeting that led to high PLK1 gene editing efficiency in a brain tumor (up to 38.1%) with negligible (less than 0.5%) off-target gene editing in high-risk tissues. Treatment with nanocapsules extended median survival time (68 days versus 24 days in nonfunctional sgRNA-treated mice). Our new CRISPR-Cas9 delivery system thus addresses various delivery challenges to demonstrate safe and tumor-specific delivery of gene editing Cas9 ribonucleoprotein for improved glioblastoma treatment that may potentially be therapeutically useful in other brain diseases.",

Hyperstimulation of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is a key driver of immunopathology following infection by viruses. We found that severely ill COVID-19 patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) display hallmarks of such hyper-stimulation with abundant agonists of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs present in their blood and lungs. These nucleic acid-containing Damage and Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs/PAMPs) can be depleted using nucleic acid-binding microfibers to limit the patient samples' ability to hyperactivate such innate immune receptors.

        "Abstract": "Living bacteria therapies have been proposed as an alternative approach to treating a broad array of cancers. In this study, we developed a genetically encoded microbial encapsulation system with tunable and dynamic expression of surface capsular polysaccharides that enhances systemic delivery. Based on a small RNA screen of capsular biosynthesis pathways, we constructed inducible synthetic gene circuits that regulate bacterial encapsulation in Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. These bacteria are capable of temporarily evading immune attack, whereas subsequent loss of encapsulation results in effective clearance in vivo. This dynamic delivery strategy enabled a ten-fold increase in maximum tolerated dose of bacteria and improved anti-tumor efficacy in murine models of cancer. Furthermore, in situ encapsulation increased the fraction of microbial translocation among mouse tumors, leading to efficacy in distal tumors. The programmable encapsulation system promises to enhance the therapeutic utility of living engineered bacteria for cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammation plays an important role in the response to danger signals arising from damage to our body and in restoring homeostasis. Dysregulated inflammatory responses occur in many diseases, including cancer, sepsis and autoimmunity. The efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs, developed for the treatment of dysregulated inflammation, can be potentiated using biomaterials, by improving the bioavailability of drugs and by reducing side effects. In this Review, we first outline key elements and stages of the inflammatory environment and then discuss the design of biomaterials for different anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies. Biomaterials can be engineered to scavenge danger signals, such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and cell-free DNA, in the early stages of inflammation. Materials can also be designed to prevent adhesive interactions of leukocytes and endothelial cells that initiate inflammatory responses. Furthermore, nanoscale platforms can deliver anti-inflammatory agents to inflammation sites. We conclude by discussing the challenges and opportunities for biomaterial innovations in addressing inflammation.",

        "Title": "Biomaterialomics: Data science-driven pathways to develop fourth-generation biomaterials.",
        "Abstract": "Conventional approaches to developing biomaterials and implants require intuitive tailoring of manufacturing protocols and biocompatibility assessment. This leads to longer development cycles, and high costs. To meet existing and unmet clinical needs, it is critical to accelerate the production of implantable biomaterials, implants and biomedical devices. Building on the Materials Genome Initiative, we define the concept 'biomaterialomics' as the integration of multi-omics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools throughout the entire pipeline of biomaterials development. The Data Science-driven approach is envisioned to bring together on a single platform, the computational tools, databases, experimental methods, machine learning, and advanced manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing) to develop the fourth-generation biomaterials and implants, whose clinical performance will be predicted using 'digital twins'. While analysing the key elements of the concept of 'biomaterialomics', significant emphasis has been put forward to effectively utilize high-throughput biocompatibility data together with multiscale physics-based models, E-platform/online databases of clinical studies, data science approaches, including metadata management, AI/ Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and uncertainty predictions. Such integrated formulation will allow one to adopt cross-disciplinary approaches to establish processing-structure-property (PSP) linkages. A few published studies from the lead author's research group serve as representative examples to illustrate the formulation and relevance of the 'Biomaterialomics' approaches for three emerging research themes, i.e. patient-specific implants, additive manufacturing, and bioelectronic medicine. The increased adaptability of AI/ML tools in biomaterials science along with the training of the next generation researchers in data science are strongly recommended. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This leading opinion review paper emphasizes the need to integrate the concepts and algorithms of the data science with biomaterials science. Also, this paper emphasizes the need to establish a mathematically rigorous cross-disciplinary framework that will allow a systematic quantitative exploration and curation of critical biomaterials knowledge needed to drive objectively the innovation efforts within a suitable uncertainty quantification framework, as embodied in 'biomaterialomics' concept, which integrates multi-omics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like machine learning. The formulation of this approach has been demonstrated for patient-specific implants, additive manufacturing, and bioelectronic medicine.",

        "Abstract": "A therapeutic strategy that targets multiple proinflammatory factors in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with minimal systemic side effects would be attractive. Here, we develop a drug-free, biodegradable nanomedicine that acts against IBD by scavenging proinflammatory cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Polyethylenimine (PEI) was conjugated to antioxidative diselenide-bridged mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (MONs) to formulate nanoparticles (MON-PEI) that exhibited high cfDNA binding affinity and ROS-responsive degradation. In ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease mouse colitis models, orally administered MON-PEI accumulated preferentially in the inflamed colon and attenuated colonic and peritoneal inflammation by alleviating cfDNA- and ROS-mediated inflammatory responses, allowing a reduced dose frequency and ameliorating colitis even after delayed treatment. This work suggests a new nanomedicine strategy for IBD treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) creates an inflammatory microenvironment characterized by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and immune cell activation that exacerbate secondary damage and impair neurological recovery. Here we develop an immunoregulatory hydrogel scaffold for treating SCI that scavenges DAMPs and slowly releases the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). We created this dual-functional scaffold by modifying a photocrosslinked gelatin hydrogel with the cationic, DAMP-binding polymer poly (amidoamine) and with IL-10, and compared the therapeutic activity of this scaffold with that of gelatin-only, gelatin\u00a0+\u00a0poly (amidoamine), and gelatin\u00a0+\u00a0IL-10 scaffolds in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the dual-functional scaffold scavenged anionic DAMPs and exhibited sustained release of IL-10, reduced the proinflammatory responses of macrophages and microglia, and enhanced the neurogenic differentiation of neural stem cells. In a complete transection SCI mouse model, the injected dual-functional scaffold suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production, promoted the M2 macrophage/microglia phenotype, and led to neural regeneration and axon growth without scar formation to a greater extent than the single-function or control scaffolds. This DAMP-scavenging, IL-10-releasing scaffold provides a new strategy for promoting neural regeneration and motor function recovery following severe SCI.",

        "Abstract": "Implanted biomaterials have transformed healthcare and the treatment of injury and disease, but their influence on the local immune landscape remains unclear. Here we discovered that degradation-resistant titanium-based implants establish an immunosuppressive microenvironment by recruiting myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and myeloid-lineage dendritic cells. Unlike normal tissues, the tissues nearby implants exhibit an chronic inflamed and immunosuppressive status characterised by myeloid-rich, T cell-exhaustion gene signature by single-cell RNA sequencing. Vitamin C treatment provides an effective strategy to rescue the immunosuppressive microenvironment, which can be used as a regular supplement to reduce the risk of malignant cell survival around the implants.",

        "Abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is important in the normal functioning of the central nervous system. An altered BBB has been described in various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of such alterations remain unclear. Here, we investigate if BBB integrity is compromised in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (also called DiGeorge syndrome), which is one of the validated genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. We utilized a set of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) derived from the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines of patients with 22q11.2-deletion-syndrome-associated schizophrenia. We found that the solute permeability of the BBB formed from patient HBMECs increases by ~1.3-1.4-fold, while the trans-endothelial electrical resistance decreases to ~62% of the control values. Correspondingly, tight junction proteins and the endothelial glycocalyx that determine the integrity of the BBB are significantly disrupted. A transcriptome study also suggests that the transcriptional network related to the cell-cell junctions in the compromised BBB is substantially altered. An enrichment analysis further suggests that the genes within the altered gene expression network also contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. Our findings suggest that neurovascular coupling can be targeted in developing novel therapeutical strategies for the treatment of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "New vaccine technologies are urgently needed to produce safe and effective vaccines in a more timely manner to prevent future infectious disease pandemics. Here, we describe erythrocyte-mediated systemic antiviral immunization, a versatile vaccination strategy that boosts antiviral immune responses by using erythrocytes decorated with virus-mimetic nanoparticles carrying a viral antigen and a Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist. As a proof of concept, polydopamine nanoparticles were synthesized via a simple in situ polymerization in which the nanoparticles were conjugated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit and the TLR7/8 agonist R848. The resulting SARS-CoV-2 virus-mimetic nanoparticles were attached to erythrocytes via catechol groups on the nanoparticle. Erythrocytes naturally home to the spleen and interact with the immune system. Injection of the nanoparticle-decorated erythrocytes into mice resulted in greater maturation and activation of antigen-presenting cells, humoral and cellular immune responses in the spleen, production of S1-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, and systemic antiviral T cell responses than a control group treated with the nanoparticles alone, with no significant negative side effects. These results show that erythrocyte-mediated systemic antiviral immunization using viral antigen- and TLR agonist-presenting polydopamine nanoparticles-a generalizable method applicable to many viral infections-is effective new approach to developing vaccines against severe infectious diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in nanoformulation have driven progress in biomedicine by producing nanoscale tools for biosensing, imaging, and drug delivery. Flash-based technology, the combination of rapid mixing technique with the self-assembly of macromolecules, is a new engine for the translational nanomedicine. Here, we review the state-of-the-art in flash-based self-assembly including theoretical and experimental principles, mixing device design, and applications. We highlight the fields of flash nanocomplexation (FNC) and flash nanoprecipitation (FNP), with an emphasis on biomedical applications of FNC, and discuss challenges and future directions for flash-based nanoformulation in biomedicine.",

        "Abstract": "Biomimetic strategies are useful for designing potent vaccines. Decorating a nanoparticulate adjuvant with cell membrane fragments as the antigen-presenting source exemplifies, such as a promising strategy. For translation, a standardizable, consistent, and scalable approach for coating nanoadjuvant with the cell membrane is important. Here a turbulent mixing and self-assembly method called flash nanocomplexation (FNC) for producing cell membrane-coated nanovaccines in a scalable manner is demonstrated. The broad applicability of this FNC technique compared with bulk-sonication by using ten different core materials and multiple cell membrane types is shown. FNC-produced biomimetic nanoparticles have promising colloidal stability and narrow particle polydispersity, indicating an equal or more homogeneous coating compared to the bulk-sonication method. The potency of a nanovaccine comprised of B16-F10 cancer cell membrane decorating mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with the adjuvant CpG is then demonstrated. The FNC-fabricated nanovaccines when combined with anti-CTLA-4 show potency in lymph node targeting, DC antigen presentation, and T cell immune activation, leading to prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in a melanoma mouse model. This study advances the design of a biomimetic nanovaccine enabled by a robust and versatile nanomanufacturing technique.",

        "Abstract": "Design of micro- or nanocarriers for drug delivery has primarily been focused on properties such as hydrophobicity, biodegradability, size, shape, surface charge, and toxicity, so that they can achieve optimal delivery with respect to drug loading, release kinetics, biodistribution, cellular uptake, and biocompatibility. Incorporation of stimulus-sensitive moieties into the carriers would lead to \"smart\" delivery systems. A further evolution would be to endow the carrier with a therapeutic function such that it no longer serves as a mere passive entity to release the drug at the target tissue but can be viewed as a therapeutic agent in itself. In this review, we will discuss recent and ongoing efforts over the past decade to design therapeutic drug carriers that confer a biological benefit, including ROS scavenging or generating, pro- or anti-inflammatory, and immuno-evasive properties, to enhance the overall therapeutic efficacy of the delivery systems.",

        "Abstract": "Nonviral direct neuronal reprogramming holds significant potential in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, the issue of low reprogramming efficiency poses a major barrier to its application. We propose that topographical cues, which have been applied successfully to enhance lineage-directed differentiation and multipotent stem cell transdifferentiation, could improve nonviral direct neuronal reprogramming efficiency. To investigate, we used a polymer-BAM (Brn2, Ascl1, Myt1l) factor transfection polypex to reprogram primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Using a multiarchitecture chip, we screened for patterns that may improve transfection and/or subsequent induced neuron reprogramming efficiency. Selected patterns were then investigated further by analyzing \u03b2-tubulin III (TUJ1) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) protein expression, cell morphology and electrophysiological function of induced neurons. Certain hierarchical topographies, with nanopatterns imprinted on micropatterns, significantly improved the percentage of TUJ1+ and MAP2+ cells. It is postulated that the microscale base pattern enhances initial BAM expression while the nanoscale sub-pattern promotes subsequent maturation. This is because the base pattern alone increased expression of TUJ1 and MAP2, while the nanoscale pattern was the only pattern yielding induced neurons capable of firing multiple action potentials. Nanoscale patterns also produced the highest fraction of cells showing spontaneous synaptic activity. Overall, reprogramming efficiency with one dose of polyplex on hierarchical patterns was comparable to that of five doses without topography. Thus, topography can enhance nonviral direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced neurons.",

        "Abstract": "Macular degeneration (MD) is characterized by the progressive deterioration of the macula and represents one of the most prevalent causes of blindness worldwide. Abnormal intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets and pericellular deposits of lipid-rich material in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) called drusen are clinical hallmarks of different forms of MD including Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy (DHRD) and age-related MD (AMD). However, the appropriate molecular therapeutic target underlying these disorder phenotypes remains elusive. Here, we address this knowledge gap by comparing the proteomic profiles of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPEs (iRPE) from individuals with DHRD and their isogenic controls. Our analysis and follow-up studies elucidated the mechanism of lipid accumulation in DHRD iRPE cells. Specifically, we detected significant downregulation of carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), an enzyme that converts cholesteryl ester to free cholesterol, an indispensable process in cholesterol export. CES1 knockdown or overexpression of EFEMP1",

        "Abstract": "Silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) have outstanding physicochemical characteristics, including the ability to interact with proteins and DNA. Given the growing number of diagnostic and therapeutic applications of AgNCs, we evaluated the impact of AgNCs on DNA replication and DNA damage response in cell-free extracts prepared from unfertilized Xenopus laevis eggs. We find that, among a number of silver nanomaterials, AgNCs uniquely inhibited genomic DNA replication and abrogated the DNA replication checkpoint in cell-free extracts. AgNCs did not affect nuclear membrane or nucleosome assembly. AgNCs-supplemented extracts showed a strong defect in the loading of the mini chromosome maintenance (MCM) protein complex, the helicase that unwinds DNA ahead of replication forks. FLAG-AgNCs immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis of AgNCs associated proteins demonstrated direct interaction between MCM and AgNCs. Our studies indicate that AgNCs directly prevent the loading of MCM, blocking pre-replication complex (pre-RC) assembly and subsequent DNA replication initiation. Collectively, our findings broaden the scope of silver nanomaterials experimental applications, establishing AgNCs as a novel tool to study chromosomal DNA replication.",

Carbon dot (Cdot) nanoparticles are a promising tool in cancer detection and therapy due to their unique photophysical properties, low cytotoxicity, and efficient ROS productivity. However, the effects of Cdots on tumor metabolism and growth are not well characterized. Here, the effects of Cdots on UM cell metabolomics, growth, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity are investigated in vitro and in vivo zebrafish and nude mouse xenograft model. Cdots dose-dependently increase ROS levels in UM cells. At Cdots concentrations below 100 \u00b5g mL",

To clarify the mechanism underlying this effect, it is necessary to understand the role of ROS in radiosensitization before clinical application. Thus, the source of ROS and their principle of tumor inhibition are first introduced. Then, nanomaterial-mediated ROS generation in radiotherapy is reviewed. The double-edged sword effect of ROS and the potential dangers they may pose to cancer patients are subsequently addressed.

        "Title": "Emulating Early Atherosclerosis in a Vascular Microphysiological System Using Branched Tissue-Engineered Blood Vessels.",
        "Abstract": "Atherosclerosis begins with the accumulation of cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins on blood vessel walls and progresses to endothelial cell dysfunction, monocyte adhesion, and foam cell formation. Endothelialized tissue-engineered blood vessels (TEBVs) have previously been fabricated to recapitulate artery functionalities, including vasoconstriction, vasodilation, and endothelium activation. Here, the initiation of atherosclerosis is emulated by designing branched TEBVs (brTEBVs) of various geometries treated with enzyme-modified low-density-lipoprotein (eLDL) and TNF-\u03b1 to induce endothelial cell dysfunction and adhesion of perfused human monocytes. Locations of monocyte adhesion under pulsatile flow are identified, and the hemodynamics in the brTEBVs are characterized using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Monocyte adhesion is greater at the side outlets than at the main outlets or inlets, and is greatest at larger side outlet branching angles (60\u00b0 or 80\u00b0 vs 45\u00b0). In PIV experiments, the branched side outlets are identified as atherosclerosis-prone areas where fluorescent particles show a transient swirling motion following flow pulses; in CFD simulations, side outlets with larger branching angles show higher vorticity magnitude and greater flow disturbance than other areas. These results suggest that the branched TEBVs with eLDL/TNF-\u03b1 treatment provide a physiologically relevant model of early atherosclerosis for preclinical studies.",

        "Abstract": "The move from reading to writing the human genome offers new opportunities to improve human health. The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) Somatic Cell Genome Editing (SCGE) Consortium aims to accelerate the development of safer and more-effective methods to edit the genomes of disease-relevant somatic cells in patients, even in tissues that are difficult to reach. Here we discuss the consortium's plans to develop and benchmark approaches to induce and measure genome modifications, and to define downstream functional consequences of genome editing within human cells. Central to this effort is a rigorous and innovative approach that requires validation of the technology through third-party testing in small and large animals. New genome editors, delivery technologies and methods for tracking edited cells in vivo, as well as newly developed animal models and human biological systems, will be assembled-along with validated datasets-into an SCGE Toolkit, which will be disseminated widely to the biomedical research community. We visualize this toolkit-and the knowledge generated by its applications-as a means to accelerate the clinical development of new therapies for a wide range of conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Three-dimensional in vitro tumor models provide more physiologically relevant responses to drugs than 2D models, but the lack of proper evaluation indices and the laborious quantitation of tumor behavior in 3D have limited the use of 3D tumor models in large-scale preclinical drug screening. Here we propose two indices of 3D tumor invasiveness-the excess perimeter index (EPI) and the multiscale entropy index (MSEI)-and combine these indices with a new convolutional neural network-based algorithm for tumor spheroid boundary detection. This new algorithm for 3D tumor boundary detection and invasiveness analysis is more accurate than any other existing algorithms. We apply this spheroid monitoring and AI-based recognition technique (\"SMART\") to evaluating the invasiveness of tumor spheroids grown from tumor cell lines and from primary tumor cells in 3D culture.",

        "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated a preexisting epidemic: the opioid crisis. Much literature has shown that the circumstances imposed by COVID-19, such as social distancing regulations, medical and financial instability, and increased mental health issues, have been detrimental to those with opioid use disorder (OUD). In addition, unexpected neurological sequelae in COVID-19 patients suggest that COVID-19 compromises neuroimmunity, induces hypoxia, and causes respiratory depression, provoking similar effects as those caused by opioid exposure. Combined conditions of COVID-19 and OUD could lead to exacerbated complications. With limited human in vivo options to study these complications, we suggest that iPSC-derived brain organoid models may serve as a useful platform to investigate the physiological connection between COVID-19 and OUD. This mini-review highlights the advances of brain organoids in other neuropsychiatric and infectious diseases and suggests their potential utility for investigating OUD and COVID-19, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "The burden of liver diseases is increasing worldwide, accounting for two million deaths annually. In the past decade, tremendous progress has been made in the basic and translational research of liver tissue engineering. Liver microtissues are small, three-dimensional hepatocyte cultures that recapitulate liver physiology and have been used in biomedical research and regenerative medicine. This review summarizes recent advances, challenges, and future directions in liver microtissue research. Cellular engineering approaches are used to sustain primary hepatocytes or produce hepatocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells and other adult tissues. Three-dimensional microtissues are generated by scaffold-free assembly or scaffold-assisted methods such as macroencapsulation, droplet microfluidics, and bioprinting. Optimization of the hepatic microenvironment entails incorporating the appropriate cell composition for enhanced cell-cell interactions and niche-specific signals, and creating scaffolds with desired chemical, mechanical and physical properties. Perfusion-based culture systems such as bioreactors and microfluidic systems are used to achieve efficient exchange of nutrients and soluble factors. Taken together, systematic optimization of liver microtissues is a multidisciplinary effort focused on creating liver cultures and on-chip models with greater structural complexity and physiological relevance for use in liver disease research, therapeutic development, and regenerative medicine.",

        "Abstract": "Chemotherapy causes off-target toxicity and is often ineffective against solid tumors. Targeted and on-demand release of chemotherapeutics remains a challenge. Here, cancer-cell-membrane-coated mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (MONs) containing X-ray- and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive diselenide bonds for controlled release of doxorubicin (DOX) at tumor sites are developed. DOX-loaded MONs coated with 4T1 breast cancer cell membranes (CM@MON@DOX) show greater accumulation at tumor sites and prolonged blood circulation time versus an uncoated control in mice bearing 4T1 orthotopic mammary tumors. Under low-dose X-ray radiation, the DOX-loaded MONs exhibit carrier degradation-controlled release via cleavage of diselenide bonds, resulting in DOX-mediated immunogenic cell death at the tumor site. Combination with a PD-L1 checkpoint blockade further enhances inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis with low systemic toxicity. Together, the findings show the promise of these biomimetic, radiation-responsive diselenide-bond-bridged MONs in chemo-immunotherapy.",

In this Review, we discuss previous efforts in materials science in developing imaging systems and microfluidic devices for the in-depth and real-time investigation of viral structures and transmission, as well as material platforms for the detection of viruses and the delivery of antiviral drugs and vaccines. We highlight the contribution of materials science to the manufacturing of personal protective equipment and to the design of simple, accurate and low-cost virus-detection devices. We then investigate future possibilities of materials science in antiviral research and treatment development, examining the role of materials in antiviral-drug design, including the importance of synthetic material platforms for organoids and organs-on-a-chip, in drug delivery and vaccination, and for the production of medical equipment. Materials-science-based technologies not only contribute to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 research efforts but can also provide platforms and tools for the understanding, protection, detection and treatment of future viral diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in CRISPR present attractive genome-editing toolsets for therapeutic strategies at the genetic level. Here, a liposome-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticle (lipoMSN) is reported as an effective CRISPR delivery system for multiplex gene-editing in the liver. The MSN provides efficient loading of Cas9 plasmid as well as Cas9 protein/guide RNA ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), while liposome-coating offers improved serum stability and enhanced cell uptake. Hypothesizing that loss-of-function mutation in the lipid-metabolism-related genes pcsk9, apoc3, and angptl3 would improve cardiovascular health by lowering blood cholesterol and triglycerides, the lipoMSN is used to deliver a combination of RNPs targeting these genes. When targeting a single gene, the lipoMSN achieved a 54% gene-editing efficiency, besting the state-of-art Lipofectamine CRISPRMax. For multiplexing, lipoMSN maintained significant gene-editing at each gene target despite reduced dosage of target-specific RNP. By delivering combinations of targeting RNPs in the same nanoparticle, synergistic effects on lipid metabolism are observed in vitro and vivo. These effects, such as a 50% decrease in serum cholesterol after 4 weeks of post-treatment with lipoMSN carrying both pcsk9 and angptl3-targeted RNPs, could not be reached with a single gene-editing approach. Taken together, this lipoMSN represents a versatile platform for the development of efficient, combinatorial gene-editing therapeutics.",

Here, we report an implantable autologous blood clot scaffold for enhanced cancer vaccination. It comprises a gel-like fibrin network formed by coagulation of blood to trap a large number of red blood cells. Upon implantation, the cross-linked RBCs in the blood clot can attract and recruit a great number of immune cells, leading to the formation of an \"immune niche.\" Encapsulated with tumor-associated antigen and adjuvant, the blood clot vaccine (BCV) can induce a robust anticancer immune response. The BCV combined with immune checkpoint blockade effectively inhibits tumor growth in B16F10 and 4T1 tumor models. The proposed implantable blood clot cancer vaccine can be readily made by mixing the blood from patients with cancer with immunomodulating agents ex vivo, followed by reimplantation into the same patient for personalized cancer immunotherapy in future clinical translation.",

        "Abstract": "Drug screening in oncology, especially for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), has high demand but remains unsatisfactory. Currently available models are either nonrepresentative of the complex tumor microenvironment or only suitable for low throughput screening, resulting in a low-yield success for drug development. To tackle these issues, the L-TumorChip system is developed in this study. It is a three-layered microfluidic tumor-on-a-chip platform integrating tumor microvasculature and tumor-stromal microenvironment with high throughput screening capability. Its layered and modular design is readily scalable through simple integration of multiple units. Here, L-TumorChip is validated with a TNBC model. The L-TumorChip system emulates certain tumor-stroma complexities and tumor-endothelium interactions, including TNBC invasion through the leaky microvasculature and angiogenesis. Additionally, with this L-TumorChip, the influence of different stromal cells, including normal fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), on cancer cell growth as well as the stromal effects on drug responses to doxorubicin treatment is investigated. The presence of CAF delays drug pharmacokinetics, while apoptotic responses indicated by caspase-3 activities are higher in coculture with normal fibroblasts. Collectively, the L-TumorChip system represents a translational high-throughput screening toolkit that enables drug screening with a scenario closer to the in vivo conditions. This potential use may therefore facilitate development of new cancer drugs.",

We demonstrate controlled release of CRISPR-Cas9 RNP and codelivery with antitumor photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) using near-infrared (NIR)- and reducing agent-responsive nanoparticles in a mouse tumor model. Nitrilotriacetic acid-decorated micelles can bind His-tagged Cas9 RNP. Lysosomal escape of nanoparticles was triggered by NIR-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by Ce6 in tumor cells. Cytoplasmic release of Cas9/single-guide RNA (sgRNA) was achieved by reduction of disulfide bond. Cas9/sgRNA targeted the antioxidant regulator ",

        "Abstract": "Cartilage defect is difficult to heal due to its avascular properties. Implantation of mesenchymal stem cell is one of the most promising approach for regenerating cartilage defects. Here we prepared polymeric nanofibrils decorated with cartilage-derived decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) as a chondroinductive scaffold material for cartilage repair. To fabricate nanofibrils, eletrospun PCL nanofibers were fragmented by subsequent mechanical and chemical process. The nanofibrils were surface-modified with poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA@NF) via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). The epoxy groups of PGMA@NF were subsequently reacted with dECM prepared from bovine articular cartilage. Therefore, the cartilage-dECM-decorated nanofibrils structurally and biochemically mimic cartilage-specific microenvironment. Once adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were self-assembled with the cartilage-dECM-decorated nanofibrils by cell-directed association, they exhibited differentiation hallmarks of chondrogenesis without additional biologic additives. ADSCs in the nanofibril composites significantly increased expression of chondrogenic gene markers in comparison to those in pellet culture. Furthermore, ADSC-laden nanofibril composites filled the osteochondral defects compactly due to their clay-like texture. Thus, the ADSC-laden nanofibril composites supported the long-term regeneration of 12 weeks without matrix loss during joint movement. The defects treated with the ADSC-laden PGMA@NF significantly facilitated reconstruction of their cartilage and subchondral bone ECM matrices compared to those with ADSC-laden nanofibrils, non-specifically adsorbing cartilage-dECM without surface decoration of PGMA.",

        "Abstract": "Though the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is vital for the maintenance of brain homeostasis, it also accounts for a high attrition rate of therapies targeting the central nervous system (CNS). The challenge of delivery across the BBB is attributed to a combination of low permeability through an endothelium closely knit by tight and adherens junctions, extremely low rates of endothelial transcytosis, and efflux transporters. In the past decade, enormous research efforts have been spent to develop BBB penetration strategies using biochemical or physical stimuli, aided by BBB-on-chips or microphysiological BBB models to facilitate in vitro studies. Here, we discuss recent advances in BBB-chip technology that have enabled effective preclinical screenings of brain targeting therapeutics and external stimulation, such as sonoporation and electroporation, for improved BBB penetration.",

We report that opioids from the inflamed colon activate \u03b4-opioid receptors (DOPr) in endosomes of nociceptors. Biopsy samples of inflamed colonic mucosa from patients and mice with colitis released opioids that activated DOPr on nociceptors to cause a sustained decrease in excitability. DOPr agonists inhibited mechanically sensitive colonic nociceptors. DOPr endocytosis and endosomal signaling by protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways mediated the sustained inhibitory actions of endogenous opioids and DOPr agonists.

        "Abstract": "Severe sepsis represents a common, expensive, and deadly health care issue with limited therapeutic options. Gaining insights into the inflammatory dysregulation that causes sepsis would help develop new therapeutic strategies against severe sepsis. In this study, we identified the crucial role of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the regulation of the Toll-like receptor 9-mediated proinflammatory pathway in severe sepsis progression. Hypothesizing that removing cfDNA would be beneficial for sepsis treatment, we used polyethylenimine (PEI) and synthesized PEI-functionalized, biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles with different charge densities as cfDNA scavengers. These nucleic acid-binding nanoparticles (NABNs) showed superior performance compared with their nucleic acid-binding polymer counterparts on inhibition of cfDNA-induced inflammation and subsequent multiple organ injury caused by severe sepsis. Furthermore, NABNs exhibited enhanced accumulation and retention in the inflamed cecum, along with a more desirable in vivo safety profile. Together, our results revealed a key contribution of cfDNA in severe sepsis and shed a light on the development of NABN-based therapeutics for sepsis therapy, which currently remains intractable.",

Localized delivery of immunomodulators to activate anticancer immunity in situ avoids overactivation of the systemic immune system and reduces side effects. Engineered biomaterials-implantable, injectable, or transdermal-fabricated into drug delivery devices are critical components for the development of localized cancer immunotherapies. In this review, we briefly summarize progress in the application of engineered biomaterials to the localized delivery of cancer immunotherapy.",

However, direct evidence to support this perception is lacking, and molecular feature of the cfDNA molecules with assumed pathological function is not well characterized. Here, we confirm remarkably increased levels of total synovial fluid and plasma cfDNAs in a large cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared to the counterparts in osteoarthritis, and demonstrate the potent inflammatogenic effects of RA synovial fluid cfDNA on both human monocyte cell line and primary cells related to RA. Massively parallel sequencing identifies distinct molecular pattern of cfDNA in RA, as characterized by enriching CpG-motif containing sequences. Importantly, these identified CpG-motif-rich sequences are hypomethylated in RA patients and induce severe inflammatory responses both ",

        "Abstract": "Radiation dosimeters are critical for accurately assessing the levels of radiation exposure of tumor sites and surrounding tissues and for optimizing therapeutic interventions as well as for monitoring environmental exposure. To fill the need for a simple, user-friendly, and inexpensive dosimeter, we designed an innovative colorimetric nanosensor-based assay for detecting ionizing radiation. We show that hydroxyl radicals generated by ionizing radiation can be used to etch gold nanorods (AuNRs) and silver nanoprisms (AgNPRs), yielding reproducible color changes for radiation dose detection in the range of 50-2000 rad, broad enough to cover doses used in hyperfractionated, conventional, and hypofractionated radiotherapy. This range of doses detected by this assay correlates with radiation-induced DNA damage response in mammalian cells. Furthermore, this AuNR- and AgNPR-based sensing platform has been established in a paper format that can be readily adopted for a wide range of applications and translation.",

        "Abstract": "In critical limb ischemia (CLI), overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impairment of neovascularization contribute to muscle damage and limb loss. Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNP, or 'nanoceria') possess oxygen-modulating properties which have shown therapeutic utility in various disease models. Here we show that CNP exhibit pro-angiogenic activity in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model, and investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the pro-angiogenic effect. CNP were injected into a ligated region of a femoral artery, and tissue reperfusion and hindlimb salvage were monitored for 3 weeks. Tissue analysis revealed stimulation of pro-angiogenic markers, maturation of blood vessels, and remodeling of muscle tissue following CNP administration. At a dose of 0.6\u00a0mg CNP, mice showed reperfusion of blood vessels in the hindlimb and a high rate of limb salvage (71%, n\u00a0=\u00a07), while all untreated mice (n\u00a0=\u00a07) suffered foot necrosis or limb loss. In vitro, CNP promoted endothelial cell tubule formation via the Ref-1/APE1 signaling pathway, and the involvement of this pathway in the CNP response was confirmed in vivo using immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice and by siRNA knockdown of APE1. These results demonstrate that CNP provide an effective treatment of CLI with excessive ROS by scavenging ROS to improve endothelial survival and by inducing Ref-1/APE1-dependent angiogenesis to revascularize an ischemic limb.",

        "Title": "Flash Fabrication of Orally Targeted Nanocomplexes for Improved Transport of Salmon Calcitonin across the Intestine.",
        "Abstract": "Salmon calcitonin (sCT) is a potent calcium-regulating peptide hormone and widely applied for the treatment of some bone diseases clinically. However, the therapeutic usefulness of sCT is hindered by the frequent injection required, owing to its short plasma half-life and therapeutic need for a high dose. Oral delivery is a popular modality of administration for patients because of its convenience to self-administration and high patient compliance, while orally administered sCT remains a great challenge currently due to the existence of multiple barriers in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Here, we introduced an orally targeted delivery system to increase the transport of sCT across the intestine through both the paracellular permeation route and the bile acid pathway. In this system, sCT-based glycol chitosan-taurocholic acid conjugate (GC-T)/dextran sulfate (DS) ternary nanocomplexes (NC-T) were produced by a flash nanocomplexation (FNC) process in a kinetically controlled mode. The optimized NC-T exhibited well-controlled properties with a uniform and sub-60 nm hydrodynamic diameter, high batch-to-batch reproducibility, good physical or chemical stability, as well as sustained drug release behaviors. The studies revealed that NC-T could effectively improve the intestinal uptake and permeability, owing to its surface functionalization with the taurocholic acid ligand. In the rat model, orally administered NC-T showed an obvious hypocalcemia effect and a relative oral bioavailability of 10.9%. An in vivo assay also demonstrated that NC-T induced no observable side effect after long-term oral administration. As a result, the orally targeted nanocomplex might be a promising candidate for improving the oral transport of therapeutic peptides.",

However, its application has been limited by its short half-life (~13\u00a0h), which requires daily injections to maintain effective drug concentrations in blood, thus increasing the risk of poor patient compliance and complications.

The global market for cell therapy is growing rapidly, and there is an increasing demand for automated methods that can produce large quantities of high quality therapeutic cells. Biomaterials can be used during cell production to establish a biomimetic microenvironment that promotes cell adhesion and proliferation while maintaining target cell genotype and phenotype.

        "Abstract": "Genome editing technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas9, are promising for treating otherwise incurable genetic diseases. Great progress has been made for ex vivo genome editing; however, major bottlenecks exist in the development of efficient, safe, and targetable in vivo delivery systems, which are needed for the treatment of many diseases. To achieve high efficacy and safety in therapeutic in vivo genome editing, editing activities must be controlled spatially and temporally in the body, which requires novel materials, delivery strategies, and control mechanisms. Thus, there is currently a tremendous opportunity for the biomaterials research community to develop in vivo delivery systems that overcome the problems of low editing efficiency, off-targeting effect, safety, and cell and tissue specificity. In this Review, we summarize delivery approaches and provide perspectives on the challenges and possible solutions, aiming to stimulate further development of engineered materials for in vivo delivery of genome-editing machinery.",

        "Title": "Scaffold-mediated non-viral delivery platform for CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing.",
        "Abstract": "Genome editing, especially via the simple and versatile type II CRISPR/Cas9 system, offers an effective avenue to precisely control cell fate, an important aspect of tissue regeneration. Unfortunately, most CRISPR/Cas9 non-viral delivery strategies only utilise micro-/nano-particle delivery methods. While these approaches provide reasonable genomic editing efficiencies, their systemic delivery may lead to undesirable off-target effects. For in vivo applications, a more localized and sustained delivery approach may be useful, particularly in the context of tissue regeneration. Here, we developed a scaffold that delivers the CRISPR/Cas9 components (i.e. single guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 protein complexes) in a localized and non-viral manner. Specifically, using mussel-inspired bioadhesive coating, polyDOPA-melanin (pDOPA), we adsorbed Cas9:sgRNA lipofectamine complexes onto bio-mimicking fiber scaffolds. To evaluate the genome-editing efficiency of this platform, U2OS.EGFP cells were used as the model cell type. pDOPA coating was essential in allowing Cas9:sgRNA lipofectamine complexes to adhere onto the scaffolds with a higher loading efficiency, while laminin coating was necessary for maintaining cell viability and proliferation on the pDOPA-coated fibers for effective gene editing (21.5% editing efficiency, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Importantly, U2OS.EGFP cells took up Cas9:sgRNA lipofectamine complexes directly from the scaffolds via reverse transfection. Overall, we demonstrate the efficacy of such fiber scaffolds in providing localized, sustained and non-viral delivery of Cas9:sgRNA complexes. Such genome editing scaffolds may find useful applications in tissue regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Currently, there is a lack of effective non-viral means to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 components for genome editing. Most existing approaches only utilize micro-/nano-particles by injection or systemic delivery, which may lead to undesirable off-target effects. Here, we report a platform that delivers the CRISPR/Cas9 components (i.e. single guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 protein complexes) in a localized and sustained manner. We used mussel-inspired bioadhesive coating to functionalize the bio-mimicking fiber scaffolds with Cas9:sgRNA lipofectamine complexes, to allow effective gene editing for the cells seeded on the scaffolds. Importantly, the cells took up Cas9:sgRNA lipofectamine complexes directly from the scaffolds. Such genome editing scaffolds may find useful applications in tissue regeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Efficiency of drug and gene delivery via nonviral vehicles is contingent on proper cellular uptake and intracellular release. Further, various cargos, such as nucleases for gene editing or inhibitors for endosomal receptors, require transport to specific compartments of the cell. Hence, characterization of cellular uptake and endocytic pathways is crucial for the optimization of any nanoparticle-mediated intracellular delivery system. Previous work on endocytic pathways looks at the effect of various pathway inhibitors on the uptake efficiency of nanoparticles carrying fluorescently-labeled cargo. While this helps attribute particle uptake to specific pathways like caveolae-mediated or clathrin-mediated endocytosis, this does not provide a holistic picture of the delivery process. Here, we provide a general protocol that combines systematic studies of inhibitor effects on efficiency with quantification of particle-induced cell membrane permeability. By applying this methodology to a nucleic acid delivery system, for example a helical polypeptide-based nanoparticle for plasmid and guide RNA delivery, we gain understanding of the endocytic mechanisms and cell uptake for intelligent design of intracellular delivery.",

        "Abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) has been increasingly applied to cancer therapy because of its tumor-tropic capability. However, short retention at target tissue and limited payload option hinder the progress of MSC-based cancer therapy. Herein, we proposed a hybrid spheroid/nanomedicine system, comprising MSC spheroid entrapping drug-loaded nanocomposite, to address these limitations. Spheroid formulation enhanced MSC's tumor tropism and facilitated loading of different types of therapeutic payloads. This system acted as an active drug delivery platform seeking and specifically targeting glioblastoma cells. It enabled effective delivery of combinational protein and chemotherapeutic drugs by engineered MSC and nanocomposite, respectively. In an in vivo migration model, the hybrid spheroid showed higher nanocomposite retention in the tumor tissue compared with the single MSC approach, leading to enhanced tumor inhibition in a heterotopic glioblastoma murine model. Taken together, this system integrates the merits of cell- and nanoparticle- mediated drug delivery with the tumor-homing characteristics of MSC to advance targeted combinational cancer therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) released from either dead or damaged cells serves as a key autoantigen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). They can be recognized by nucleic acid (NA) sensors such as the toll-like receptor (TLR), leading to activation of the innate immune system and chronic inflammation. Developed here is a cationic molecular scavenger, by screening cationic dendronized polymers, which eliminates cfDNA and inhibits TLR recognition and nucleic-acid-induced inflammation. The structure-property study demonstrates that toxicity, NA binding capacity, and biodistribution could be balanced to achieve maximum therapeutic effect by exquisite control of the molecular structure. In addition, the optimized cationic polymer effectively inhibited joint swelling, synovial hyperplasia, and bone destruction in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat models. The results offer support for synthetic polymers offering new paradigm in autoimmune disease treatment.",

Strategies for early and precise detection of breast cancer cells are highly desired in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. Here, we report on the efficient detection of HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer cells using an amplified signal scheme enabled by gold nanoclusters entrapped in mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs). The utilization of MSNs as an excellent enzyme immobilization support and gold nanoclusters as an effective peroxidase mimic imparts high sensitivity to this detection platform. In addition, the inclusion of target-specific HER2 antibodies adds excellent selectivity. Determination of HER2+ cancer cells in breast cancer tissue demonstrates the potential application of this biosensor design in clinical diagnosis in particular, and bioanalysis in general.",

        "Abstract": "Cutaneous injuries, especially chronic wounds, burns, and skin wound infection, require painstakingly long-term treatment with an immense financial burden to healthcare systems worldwide. However, clinical management of chronic wounds remains unsatisfactory in many cases. Various strategies including growth factor and gene delivery as well as cell therapy have been used to enhance the healing of non-healing wounds. Drug delivery systems across the nano, micro, and macroscales can extend half-life, improve bioavailability, optimize pharmacokinetics, and decrease dosing frequency of drugs and genes. Replacement of the damaged skin tissue with substitutes comprising cell-laden scaffold can also restore the barrier and regulatory functions of skin at the wound site. This review covers comprehensively the advanced treatment strategies to improve the quality of wound healing.",

However, no oral protein formulations are commercially available currently due to hostile gastrointestinal (GI) barriers resulting in insignificant oral bioavailability of macromolecular drugs. Herein, we used insulin as a model protein drug; insulin-loaded N-(2-hydroxy)-propyl-3-trimethylammonium chloride modified chitosan (HTCC)/sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) nanocomplex (NC) as a nanocore was further encapsulated into enteric Eudragit L100-55 material, through a two-step flash nanocomplexation (FNC) process in a reliable and scalable manner, forming our NC-in-Eudragit composite particles (NE). Particle size and surface properties of our optimized NE were tailored to protect the loaded insulin from acidic degradation in the hostile stomach environment and to achieve intestinal site-specific drug release as well as the improvement of oral delivery efficiency of insulin. In addition, the oral administration of the optimized NE to type 1 diabetic rats could induce a very significant hypoglycemic effect with a relative oral bioavailability of 13.3%. Our results demonstrated that enteric encapsulation of nanotherapeutics using a FNC apparatus could cause drug formulations to possess better size controllability, batch-mode reproducibility, and homogeneous surface coating and then significantly enhance their oral bioavailability of insulin, indicating its great potential for clinical translation of oral protein therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Oral chemotherapy has been emerging as a hopeful therapeutic regimen for the treatment of various cancers because of its high safety and convenience, lower costs, and high patient compliance. Currently, nanoparticulate drug delivery systems (NDDS) exhibit many unique advantages in mediating oral drug delivery; however, many anticancer drugs that were susceptible in hostile gastrointestinal (GI) environment showed poor permeability across intestinal epithelium, and most materials used as drug carriers are nonactive excipients and displayed no therapeutically relevant function, which leads to low oral bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs (e.g., paclitaxel). Inspired by these, in this study, paclitaxel (PTX) was used as a model drug, depending on intermolecular hydrogen-bonded interactions, PTX-loaded tannic acid/poly( N-vinylpyrrolidone) nanoparticles (PTX-NP) were produced by a flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) process. The optimized PTX-NP showed an average diameter of 54 nm with a drug encapsulation efficiency of 80% and loading capacity of 14.5%. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to illuminate the assembling mechanism of hydrogen-bonded PTX-NP. In vitro and in vivo results confirmed that PTX-NP showed pH-dependent intestinal site-specific drug release, P-gp inhibitory function by tannic acid (TA), prolonged intestinal retention, and improved trans-epithelial transport properties. Oral administration of PTX-NP generated a high oral delivery efficiency and relative oral bioavailability of 25.6% in rats, and further displayed a significant tumor-inhibition effect in a xenograft breast tumor model. These findings confirmed that our PTX-NP might be a promising oral drug formulation for chemotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "Molecularly, breast cancer represents a highly heterogenous family of neoplastic disorders, with substantial interpatient variations regarding genetic mutations, cell composition, transcriptional profiles, and treatment response. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for alternative diagnostic approaches aimed at the molecular annotation of the disease on a patient-by-patient basis and the design of more personalized treatments. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) technology enables the development of such novel approaches. For instance, in diagnostics, the use of the RNA-specific C2c2 system allows ultrasensitive nucleic acid detection and could be used to characterize the mutational repertoire and transcriptional breast cancer signatures. In disease modeling, CRISPR/Cas9 technology can be applied to selectively engineer oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes involved in disease pathogenesis. In treatment, CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to develop gene-therapy, while its catalytically-dead variant (dCas9) can be applied to reprogram the epigenetic landscape of malignant cells. As immunotherapy becomes increasingly prominent in cancer treatment, CRISPR/Cas9 can engineer the immune cells to redirect them against cancer cells and potentiate antitumor immune responses. In this review, CRISPR strategies for the advancement of breast cancer diagnostics, modeling, and treatment are highlighted, culminating in a perspective on developing a precision medicine-based approach against breast cancer.",

The embedded therapeutic drugs, however, are largely limited to hydrophobic small molecules. By transferring proteins into organic solvent via hydrophobic ion pairing, the scope of FNP applications is expanded. This platform technology is capable of producing protein nanoparticles with tunable sizes (from \u224830 nm to sub-micrometers), high-production scale (grams per hour), high drug loading efficiency (>90%), and excellent reproducibility, opening a new paradigm for formulation of biological pharmaceuticals. As a proof-of-concept, insulin nanoparticles are made to address a major medical challenge; oral administration. A relative insulin bioavailability of 13.2% is achieved, enabling sustained reduction of blood glucose levels in a diabetic rat model.",

Here we show that ~40\u2009nm cationic nanoparticles (cNP) can scavenge cfDNA derived from RA patients and inhibit the activation of primary synovial fluid monocytes and fibroblast-like synoviocytes. Using clinical scoring, micro-CT images, MRI, and histology, we show that intravenous injection of cNP into a CpG-induced mouse model or collagen-induced arthritis rat model can relieve RA symptoms including ankle and tissue swelling, and bone and cartilage damage. This culminates in the manifestation of partial mobility recovery of the treated rats in a rotational cage test. Mechanistic studies on intracellular trafficking and biodistribution of cNP, as well as measurement of cytokine expression in the joints and cfDNA levels in systemic circulation and inflamed joints also correlate with therapeutic outcomes. This work suggests a new direction of nanomedicine in treating inflammatory diseases.",

        "Title": "Size-controlled lipid nanoparticle production using turbulent mixing to enhance oral DNA delivery.",
        "Abstract": "Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) have been developed to address the transport and uptake barriers to enhance the delivery efficiency of plasmid DNA therapeutics. In these systems, plasmid DNA can be encapsulated through condensation by a cationic lipid to form lipo-complexes, or polycation following complexation into cationic liposomes to form lipo-polyplexes. Conventional methods for achieving these two DNA-delivering LNP vehicles suffer from significant batch-to-batch variation, poor scalability and complicated multi-step preparation procedures. Resultant nanoparticles often have uncontrollable size and surface charge with wide distribution, and poor stability when exposed to physiological media. Here we report a single-step flash nanocomplexation (FNC) process using turbulent mixing to prepare uniform lipo-complex or lipo-polyplex LNPs in a scalable manner, demonstrating excellent control over the nanoparticle size (from 40 to several hundred nm) and surface charge, with narrow size distribution. The FNC-produced LNPs could be purified and concentrated using a tangential flow filtration (TFF) process in a scalable manner. An optimized formulation of purified lipo-complex LNPs (DOTAP/Chol/DNA, 45\u202fnm) showed significantly higher (5-fold in the lungs and 4-fold in the liver) transgene expression activity upon oral dosage than lipo-polyplex LNPs (DPPC/Chol/lPEI/DNA, 75\u202fnm) or lPEI/DNA nanoparticles (43\u202fnm). Repeated dosing (4\u202fdays, 150\u202f\u03bcg/day) of the lipo-complex LNPs sustained the transgene activity over a period of one week without detectable toxicity in major organs, suggesting its potential for clinical translation. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We report a new method to prepare uniform size-controlled lipid-based DNA-loaded nanoparticles by turbulent mixing delivered by a multi-inlet vortex mixer. Two distinct compositions were successfully prepared: (1) lipo-complexes, through condensation of the plasmid DNA by cationic lipids; (2) lipo-polyplexes, by encapsulation of DNA/PEI together with neutral lipids. Comparing with conventional methods, which use multi-step processes with high batch-to-batch variations and poor control over nanoparticle characteristics, this method offers a single-step, continuous and reproducible assembly methodology that would promote the translation of such gene medicine products. Effective purification and concentration of nanoparticles were achieved by adopted tangential flow filtration method. Following oral gavage in mice, the lipo-complex nanoparticles showed the highest level of transgene expression in the lung and liver.",

        "Abstract": "Efficient nonviral oral gene delivery offers an attractive modality for chronic protein replacement therapy. Herein, the oral delivery of insulin gene is reported by a nonviral vector comprising a copolymer with a high degree of substitution of branched polyethylenimine on chitosan (CS-g-bPEI). Protecting the plasmid from gastric acidic degradation and facilitating transport across the gut epithelium, the CS-g-bPEI/insulin plasmid DNA nanoparticles (NPs) can achieve systemic transgene expression for days. A single dose of orally administered NPs (600 \u00b5g plasmid insulin (pINS)) to diabetic mice can protect the animals from hyperglycemia for more than 10 d. Three repeated administrations spaced over a 10 d interval produce similar glucose-lowering results with no hepatotoxicity detected. Positron-emission-tomography and computed-tomography images also confirm the glucose utilization by muscle cells. While this work suggests the feasibility of basal therapy for diabetes mellitus, its significance lies in the demonstration of a nonviral oral gene delivery system that can impact chronic protein replacement therapy and DNA vaccination.",

        "Abstract": "It has been shown that material surface topography greatly affects cell attachment, growth, proliferation, and differentiation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms for cell-material interactions are still not understood well. Here, two kinds of butterfly wings with different surface architectures were employed for addressing such an issue. Papilio ulysses telegonus (P.u.t.) butterfly wing surface is composed of micro/nanoconcaves, whereas Morpho menelaus (M.m.) butterfly wings are decorated with grooves. RSC96 cells grown on M.m. wings showed a regular sorting pattern along with the grooves. On the contrary, the cells seeded on P.u.t. wings exhibited random arrangement. Transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis revealed that huntingtin (Htt)-regulated lysosome activity is a potential key factor for determining cell growth behavior on M.m. butterfly wings. Gene silence further confirmed this notion. In vivo experiments showed that the silicone tubes fabricated with M.m. wings markedly facilitate rat sciatic nerve regeneration after injury. Lysosome activity and Htt expression were greatly increased in the M.m. wing-fabricated graft-bridged nerves. Collectively, our data provide a theoretical basis for employing butterfly wings to construct biomimetic nerve grafts and establish Htt lysosome as a crucial regulator for cell-material interactions.",

        "Abstract": "Burn, trauma, and various medical conditions including bacterial infection, diabetes complication, and surgery could lead to an acute cutaneous wound and scar formation. Application of tissue glues instead of sutures could minimize the additional trauma and scar formation. Despite the countless efforts devoted to the development of high-strength tissue glues, little attention has been paid to their influence on the scar formation. Here, we report the development of a new tissue glue with excellent biocompatibility and tunable degradability for scarless wound closure. A series of catechol-containing poly(amidoamine) (CPAA) polymers were synthesized via the one-step Michael addition of dopamine and bisacrylamide. The tertiary amino group in the polymer backbone was used to introduce a zwitterionic sulfobetaine group by one-step ring-opening polymerization. The introduction of the zwitterionic sulfobetaine group could easily tune the hydrophilicity and the degradability of CPAA without influencing the density of the catechol group in the polymer. Lap-shear tests on the porcine skin demonstrated a high adhesion strength of 7 kPa at 1 h, rising to 24 kPa by 12 h. Addition of silica nanoparticles could further enhance the adhesion strength by 50%. In vivo studies further confirmed that the CPAA tissue glue could effectively accelerate the healing process of incisional wounds on the back of Sprague Dawley rats compared with suture and reduce the scar formation.",

        "Abstract": "The surfaces of many hollow or tubular tissues/organs in our respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts are covered by mucosa with folded patterns. The patterns are induced by mechanical instability of the mucosa under compression due to constrained growth. Recapitulating this folding process in vitro will facilitate the understanding and engineering of mucosa in various tissues/organs. However, scant attention has been paid to address the challenge of reproducing mucosal folding. Here we mimic the mucosal folding process using a cell-laden hydrogel film attached to a prestretched tough-hydrogel substrate. The cell-laden hydrogel constitutes a human epithelial cell lining on stromal component to recapitulate the physiological feature of a mucosa. Relaxation of the prestretched tough-hydrogel substrate applies compressive strains on the cell-laden hydrogel film, which undergoes mechanical instability and evolves into morphological patterns. We predict the conditions for mucosal folding as well as the morphology of and strain in the folded artificial mucosa using a combination of theory and simulation. The work not only provides a simple method to fold artificial mucosa but also demonstrates a paradigm in tissue engineering via harnessing mechanical instabilities guided by quantitative mechanics models.",

        "Abstract": "A low toxicity and efficient delivery system is needed to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNA) in vitro and in vivo. The use of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) is becoming increasingly common due to its biocompatibility, tunable pore size and customizable properties. However, bolus delivery of siRNA/MSN complexes remains suboptimal, especially when a sustained and long-term administration is required. Here, we utilized electrospun scaffolds for sustained delivery of siRNA/MSN-PEI through surface adsorption and nanofiber encapsulation. As a proof-of-concept, we targeted collagen type I expression to modulate fibrous capsule formation. Surface adsorption of siRNA/MSN-PEI provided sustained availability of siRNA for at least 30\u202fdays in vitro. As compared to conventional bolus delivery, such scaffold-mediated transfection provided more effective gene silencing (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). On the contrary, a longer sustained release was attained (at least 5\u202fmonths) when siRNA/MSN-PEI complexes were encapsulated within the electrospun fibers. In vivo subcutaneous implantation and biodistribution analysis of these scaffolds revealed that siRNA remained localized up to \u223c290\u202f\u03bcm from the implants. Finally, a fibrous capsule reduction of \u223c45.8% was observed after 4\u202fweeks in vivo as compared to negative scrambled siRNA treatment. Taken together, these results demonstrate the efficacy of scaffold-mediated sustained delivery of siRNA/MSN-PEI for long-term non-viral gene silencing applications.",

        "Abstract": "Controlled delivery of protein therapeutics remains a challenge. Here, the inclusion of diselenide-bond-containing organosilica moieties into the framework of silica to fabricate biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with oxidative and redox dual-responsiveness is reported. These diselenide-bridged MSNs can encapsulate cytotoxic RNase A into the 8-10 nm internal pores via electrostatic interaction and release the payload via a matrix-degradation controlled mechanism upon exposure to oxidative or redox conditions. After surface cloaking with cancer-cell-derived membrane fragments, these bioinspired RNase A-loaded MSNs exhibit homologous targeting and immune-invasion characteristics inherited from the source cancer cells. The efficient in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer performance, which includes increased blood circulation time and enhanced tumor accumulation along with low toxicity, suggests that these cell-membrane-coated, dual-responsive degradable MSNs represent a promising platform for the delivery of bio-macromolecules such as protein and nucleic acid therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Biological systems have developed an efficient multi-tiered defense system to block foreign substances such as engineered nanomaterials (NMs) from causing damage. In a pathological scenario, the disease itself may also pose additional barriers due to the imbalance between abnormal cells and their surrounding microenvironment, and NMs could behave similarly or differently to classic foreign substances, depending on their unique characteristics. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that govern the fate of NMs against these biological barriers, including the strategies that can be used to shift their fate between access and blockage, become key information for NMs design. In this manuscript, we first describe the biological barriers that NMs may encounter, and further discuss how these biological barrier interactions could shift the fate of NMs between toxicity and therapeutic potential. A list of effects that may influence NMs access at nano/bio interface are presented and discussed, followed by personal insights on the important nano/bio topics that require additional research for a better understanding of NM/biological barrier interactions.",

Yet the restricted mobility of surficial AMP often compromises its activity. Here, we report a simple but effective strategy to allow a more flexible display of AMP on the biomaterial surface and demonstrate its efficacy for wound healing. The AMP, tachyplesin I (Tac), is tagged with the polyhydroxyalkanoate-granule-associated protein (PhaP) and immobilized on haloarchaea-produced poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBHV) via hydrophobic interaction. The PhaP-Tac coating effectively inhibits the growth of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It also increases the surface hydrophilicity to improve fibroblast proliferation in\u00a0vitro, and accelerates wound healing by decreasing bacterial counts to below 10",

        "Abstract": "Nanoparticulate vaccines can potentiate immune responses by site-specific drainage to lymph nodes (LNs). This approach may benefit from a nanoparticle engineering method with fine control over size and codelivery of antigen and adjuvant. Here, we applied the flash nanocomplexation (FNC) method to prepare nanovaccines via polyelectrolyte complexation of chitosan and heparin to coencapsulate the VP1 protein antigen from enterovirus 71, which causes hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD), with tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF) or CpG as adjuvants. FNC allows for reduction of the nanovaccine size to range from 90 to 130 nm with relatively narrower size distribution and a high payload capacity. These nanovaccines reached both proximal and distal LNs via subcutaneous injection and subsequently exhibited prolonged retention in the LNs. The codelivery induced strong immune activation toward a Th1 response in addition to a potent Th2 response, and conferred effective protection against lethal virus challenge comparable to that of an approved inactivated viral vaccine in mouse models of both passive and active immunization setting. In addition, these nanovaccines also elicited strong IgA titers, which may offer unique advantages for mucosal protection. This study addresses the issues of size control, antigen bioactivity retention, and biomanufacturing to demonstrate the translational potential of a subunit nanovaccine design.",

        "Abstract": "The topography of the extracellular substrate provides physical cues to elicit specific downstream biophysical and biochemical effects in cells. An example of such a topographical substrate is periodic gratings, where the dimensions of the periodic gratings influence cell morphology and directs cell differentiation. We first develop a novel sample preparation technique using Spurr's resin to allow for cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy imaging of cells on grating grooves, and observed that the plasma membrane on the basal surface of these cells can deform and bend into grooves between the gratings. We postulate that such membrane bending is an important first step in eliciting downstream effects. Thus, we use a combination of image analysis and mathematical modeling to explain the extent of bending of basal membrane into grooves. We show that the extent to which the basal membrane bends into grooves depends on both groove width and angle of the grating ridge. Our model predicts that the basal membrane will bend into grooves when they are wider than 1.9\u2009\u00b5m in width. The existence of such a threshold may provide an explanation for how the width of periodic gratings may bring about cellular downstream effects, such as cell proliferation or differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "Effective and safe delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing elements remains a challenge. Here we report the development of PEGylated nanoparticles (named P-HNPs) based on the cationic \u03b1-helical polypeptide poly(\u03b3-4-((2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethyl)aminomethyl)benzyl-l-glutamate) for the delivery of Cas9 expression plasmid and sgRNA to various cell types and gene-editing scenarios. The cell-penetrating \u03b1-helical polypeptide enhanced cellular uptake and promoted escape of pCas9 and/or sgRNA from the endosome and transport into the nucleus. The colloidally stable P-HNPs achieved a Cas9 transfection efficiency up to 60% and sgRNA uptake efficiency of 67.4%, representing an improvement over existing polycation-based gene delivery systems. After performing single or multiplex gene editing with an efficiency up to 47.3% in vitro, we demonstrated that P-HNPs delivering Cas9 plasmid/sgRNA targeting the polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) gene achieved 35% gene deletion in HeLa tumor tissue to reduce the Plk1 protein level by 66.7%, thereby suppressing the tumor growth by >71% and prolonging the animal survival rate to 60% within 60 days. Capable of delivering Cas9 plasmids to various cell types to achieve multiplex gene knock-out, gene knock-in, and gene activation in vitro and in vivo, the P-HNP system offers a versatile gene-editing platform for biological research and therapeutic applications.",

        "Abstract": "Scalable manufacturing continues to present a major barrier for clinical translation of nanotherapeutics. Methods available for fabricating protein-encapsulating nanoparticles in a scalable fashion are scarce. Protein delivery often requires multiple functionalities to be incorporated into the same vehicle. Specifically for nanoparticle-mediated oral delivery of protein therapeutics, protection in GI tract, site-specific release, facilitating transmucosal permeation, and enhancing epithelial transport are a few desirable features to be engineered into a nanoparticle system. Here we devised a sequential flash nanocomplexation (FNC) technique for the scalable production of a core-shell structured nanoparticle system by combining materials choice and particle size and structure to fulfill these functions, therefore enhancing the delivery efficiency of insulin. This method is highly effective in controlling the size, generating core-shell structure with high encapsulation efficiency (97%) and payload capacity (67%) using insulin/l-penetratin complex nanoparticles as a core coated with hyaluronic acid (HA). Both the in vitro and in vivo models confirmed that the HA coating on these core-shell nanoparticles enhanced the permeation of nanoparticles through the intestinal mucus layer and improved trans-epithelial absorption of insulin nanoparticles; and the enhancement effect was most prominent using HA with the highest average molecular weight. The insulin-loaded nanoparticles were then encapsulated into enteric microcapsules (MCs) in an FNC process to provide additional protection against the acidic environment in the stomach while allowing rapid release of insulin nanoparticles when they reach small intestine. The optimized multifunctional MCs delivered an effective glucose reduction in a Type I diabetes rat model following a single oral administration, yielding a relative bioavailability of 11% in comparison with subcutaneous injection of free-form insulin. This FNC technique is highly effective in controlling particle size and structure to improve delivery properties and function. It can be easily extended to oral delivery for other protein therapeutics.",

The polymeric multilayer structure is characterized by transmission electron microscopy, matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and \u03b6-potential. The amount of siRNA electrostatically incorporated into the nanoparticle can be tuned by the number of polymeric shells, which in turn influences the cellular uptake and gene silencing effect. In a bioreductive environment, the interlayer disulfide bond breaks to release the siRNA from the degraded polymeric shells. Intravenously injected c-Myc siRNA-incorporated particles accumulate in the tumor site of a murine lung carcinoma model and significantly suppress the tumor growth. Therefore, the combination of a size-tunable AuNP core and an ATRP-functionalized shell offers control and versatility in the effective delivery of siRNA.",

        "Title": "Bioreactor model of neuromuscular junction with electrical stimulation for pharmacological potency testing.",
        "Abstract": "In vitro models of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) are emerging as a valuable tool to study synaptogenesis, synaptic maintenance, and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Many models have previously been developed using a variety of cell sources for skeletal muscle and motoneurons. These models can advanced by integrating beneficial features of the native developmental milieu of the NMJ. We created a functional in vitro model of NMJ by bioreactor cultivation of transdifferentiated myocytes and stem cell-derived motoneurons, in the presence of electrical stimulation. In conjunction with a coculture medium, electrical stimulation resulted in improved maturation and function of motoneurons and myocytes, as evidenced by mature cellular structures, increased expression of neuronal and muscular genes, clusterization of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the vicinity of motoneurons, and the response to glutamate stimulation. To validate the model and demonstrate its utility for pharmacological testing, we documented the potency of drugs that affect key pathways during NMJ signal transduction: (i) acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis, (ii) ACh vesicular storage, (iii) ACh synaptic release, (iv) AChR activation, and (v) ACh inactivation in the synaptic cleft. The model properly responded to the drugs in a concentration-dependent manner. We thus propose that this in vitro model of NMJ could be used as a platform in pharmacological screening and controlled studies of neuromuscular diseases.",

        "Abstract": "The rational design of highly selective and cancer-targeted nanodrug delivery systems with attractive anticancer activities is urgently needed for future exploration and translational application of nanomedicine. As angiogenesis and tumor growth could be mutually enhanced, dual therapeutic nanomedicine with simultaneous antiangiogenesis and anticancer activities is practical for cancer therapy. Therefore, herein we have rationally designed functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) to realize the dual therapy of tumor growth and angiogenesis based on the biochemical similarity of membranes of cancer cells and angiogenic cells. This nanosystem demonstrates high selectivity in vivo against cancer cells with high integrin expression levels in two-tumor bearing models, and could simultaneously inhibit cancer cell growth and disrupt tumor neovasculature, thus achieving satisfactory in vivo anticancer efficacy. Interestingly, the nanosystem triggers ROS overproduction in both cancer and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which activates various downstream signaling pathways to regulate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, the nanosystem also effectively reduces the toxic side effects of loaded drugs to normal tissues and prolongs blood circulation in vivo. Therefore, this study provides a simple approach for facile manufacture of a potent nanodrug delivery system that could achieve dual therapy of tumor growth and angiogenesis.",

We emphasize that continuous exploration of biomaterial technologies to engineer a more SMC-specific microenvironment will provide further insight on complex vascular diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Although tumor-targeting nanovehicles for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) chemotherapy have attracted great research and clinic interest, the poor cancer penetration, inefficient cellular uptake, and slow intracellular drug release greatly compromise their therapeutic outcomes. In this work, a multifunctional mixed micellar system, consisting of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) for specific liver-targeting, trans-activator of transcription (TAT) peptide for potent cell penetration, and pH-sensitive poly(\u03b2-amino ester) polymers for acidic-triggered drug release, was developed to provide HCC-targeting delivery and pH-triggered release of doxorubicin (DOX). These micelles were hypothesized to efficaciously accumulate in HCC site by the guide of GA ligands, enter into cancer cells facilitated by the activated TAT peptide on the micellar surface, and finally rapidly release DOX in cytoplasm. To demonstrate this design, DOX was initially loaded in micelles modified with both GA and TAT (DOX/GA@TAT-M) with high drug loading efficiency and pH-sensitive drug release profiles. The HCC-targeting cellular uptake and synergetic anticancer efficacy were tested, indicating DOX/GA@TAT-M could be specifically and effectively internalized into HCC cells by the effect of GA targeting and TAT penetrating with enhanced cytotoxicity. In addition, the prolonged circulation time and enhanced accumulation in tumor facilitated its potent tumor growth inhibition activity in vivo. These results demonstrated that the cleavable multifunctional mixed micelles with tumor targeting, controlled TAT peptide activation, and sequential pH-sensitive drug release could be an efficient strategy for HCC treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Genome editing offers promising solutions to genetic disorders by editing DNA sequences or modulating gene expression. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology can be used to edit single or multiple genes in a wide variety of cell types and organisms in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we review the rapidly developing CRISPR/Cas9-based technologies for disease modeling and gene correction and recent progress toward Cas9/guide RNA (gRNA) delivery based on viral and nonviral vectors. We discuss the relative merits of delivering the genome editing elements in the form of DNA, mRNA, or protein, and the opportunities of combining viral delivery of a transgene encoding Cas9 with nonviral delivery of gRNA. We highlight the lessons learned from nonviral gene delivery in the past three decades and consider their applicability for CRISPR/Cas9 delivery. We also include a discussion of bioinformatics tools for gRNA design and chemical modifications of gRNA. Finally, we consider the extracellular and intracellular barriers to nonviral CRISPR/Cas9 delivery and propose strategies that may overcome these barriers to realize the clinical potential of CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing.",

        "Abstract": "Co-delivery of multiple drugs with complementary anticancer mechanisms by nano-carriers offers an effective strategy to treat cancer. The combination of drugs with pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic activities is potentially effective in treating human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, we developed a co-delivery system for doxorubicin (Dox), a pro-apoptotic drug, and curcumin (Cur), a potent drug for antiangiogenesis, in pH-sensitive nanoparticles (NPs) constituted with amphiphilic poly(\u03b2-amino ester) copolymer. Dox & Cur co-loaded NPs ((D+C)/NPs) were prepared with optimized drug ratio, showing low polydispersity, high encapsulation efficiency, and enhanced release in the acidic environment of cancer cells. Furthermore, enhanced cellular internalization of cargoes delivered from (D+C)/NPs were observed in human liver cancer SMMC 7721 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) compared to the use of free drugs. The (D+C)/NPs induced a high rate of apoptosis in SMMC 7721 cells through decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, (D+C)/NPs exhibited stronger anti-angiogenic effects including inhibition of HUVEC proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation mediated VEGF pathway modulation in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, encapsulation of the pro-apoptotic drug Dox and antiangiogenic agent Cur in pH-sensitive NPs provides a promising strategy to effectively inhibit HCC progression in a synergistic manner.",

        "Abstract": "Controlled delivery of protein would find diverse therapeutic applications. Formulation of protein nanoparticles by polyelectrolyte complexation between the protein and a natural polymer such as chitosan (CS) is a popular approach. However, the current method of batch-mode mixing faces significant challenges in scaling up while maintaining size control, high uniformity, and high encapsulation efficiency. Here we report a new method, termed flash nanocomplexation (FNC), to fabricate insulin nanoparticles by infusing aqueous solutions of CS, tripolyphosphate (TPP), and insulin under rapid mixing condition (Re\u00a0>\u00a01600) in a multi-inlet vortex mixer. In comparison with the bulk-mixing method, the optimized FNC process produces CS/TPP/insulin nanoparticles with a smaller size (down to 45\u00a0nm) and narrower size distribution, higher encapsulation efficiency (up to 90%), and pH-dependent nanoparticle dissolution and insulin release. The CS/TPP/insulin nanoparticles can be lyophilized and reconstituted without loss of activity, and produced at a throughput of 5.1\u00a0g\u00a0h",

        "Abstract": "Theranostics based on nanoparticles (NPs) is a promising paradigm in nanomedicine. Mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN)-based systems offer unique characteristics to enable multimodal imaging or simultaneous diagnosis and therapy. They include large surface area and volume, tunable pore size, functionalizable surface, and acceptable biological safety. Hybridization with other NPs and chemical modification can further potentiate the multifunctionality of MSN-based systems toward translation. Here, we update the recent progress on MSN-based systems for theranostic purposes. We discuss various synthetic approaches used to construct the theranostic platforms either via intrinsic chemistry or extrinsic combination. These include defect generation in the silica structure, encapsulation of diagnostic NPs within silica, their assembly on the silica surface, and direct conjugation of dye chemicals. Collectively, in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that multimodal imaging capacities can be integrated with the therapeutic functions of these MSN systems for therapy. With further improvement in bioimaging sensitivity and targeting specificity, the multifunctional MSN-based theranostic systems will find many clinical applications in the near future.",

        "Abstract": "Transdifferentiation has been described as a novel method for converting human fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocyte-like cells. Such an approach can produce differentiated cells to study physiology or pathophysiology, examine drug interactions or toxicities, and engineer cardiac tissues. Here we describe the transdifferentiation of human dermal fibroblasts towards the cardiac cell lineage via the induced expression of transcription factors GATA4, TBX5, MEF2C, MYOCD, NKX2-5, and delivery of microRNAs miR-1 and miR-133a. Cells undergoing transdifferentiation expressed ACTN2 and TNNT2 and partially organized their cytoskeleton in a cross-striated manner. The conversion process was associated with significant upregulation of a cohort of cardiac-specific genes, activation of pathways associated with muscle contraction and physiology, and downregulation of fibroblastic markers. We used a genetically encoded calcium indicator and readily detected active calcium transients although no spontaneous contractions were observed in transdifferentiated cells. Finally, we determined that inhibition of Janus kinase 1, inhibition of Glycogen synthase kinase 3, or addition of NRG1 significantly enhanced the efficiency of transdifferentiation. Overall, we describe a method for achieving transdifferentiation of human dermal fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocyte-like cells via transcription factor overexpression, microRNA delivery, and molecular pathway manipulation.",

        "Abstract": "Substrate nanotopography has been shown to be a potent modulator of cell phenotype and function. To dissect nanotopography modulation of cell behavior, a large area of nanopatterned substrate is desirable so that enough cells can be cultured on the nanotopography for subsequent biochemical and molecular biology analyses. However, current nanofabrication techniques have limitations to generate highly defined nanopatterns over a large area. Herein, we present a method to expand nanopatterned substrates from a small, highly defined nanopattern to a large area using stitch technique. The method combines multiple techniques, involving soft lithography to replicate poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) molds from a well-defined mold, stitch technique to assemble multiple PDMS molds to a single large mold, and nanoimprinting to generate a master mold on polystyrene (PS) substrates. With the PS master mold, we produce PDMS working substrates and demonstrate nanotopographical modulation of cell spreading. This method provides a simple, affordable yet versatile avenue to generate well-defined nanopatterns over large areas, and is potentially extended to create micro-/nanoscale devices with hybrid components.",

        "Abstract": "Trauma patients produce a host of danger signals and high levels of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) after cellular injury and tissue damage. These DAMPs are directly and indirectly involved in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory and thrombotic complications in patients with severe injuries. No effective therapeutic agents for the removal of DAMPs from blood or tissue fluid have been developed. Herein, we demonstrated that nucleic acid binding polymers, e.g., polyethylenimine (PEI) and polyamidoamine dendrimers, immobilized onto electrospun microfiber mesh can effectively capture various DAMPs, such as extracellular DNAs and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). Furthermore, treatment with PEI-immobilized microfiber mesh abrogated the ability of DAMPs, released from dead and dying cells in culture or found in patients following traumatic injury, to activate innate immune responses and coagulation in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Nucleic acid scavenging microfiber meshes represent an effective strategy to combat inflammation and thrombosis in trauma.",

        "Abstract": "Regeneration of diseased tissue is one of the foremost concerns for millions of patients who suffer from tissue damage each year. Local delivery of cell-laden hydrogels offers an attractive approach for tissue repair. However, due to the typical macroscopic size of these cell constructs, the encapsulated cells often suffer from poor nutrient exchange. These issues can be mitigated by incorporating cells into microscopic hydrogels, or microgels, whose large surface-to-volume ratio promotes efficient mass transport and enhanced cell-matrix interactions. Using microfluidic technology, monodisperse cell-laden microgels with tunable sizes can be generated in a high-throughput manner, making them useful building blocks that can be assembled into tissue constructs with spatially controlled physicochemical properties. In this review, we examine microfluidics-generated cell-laden microgels for tissue regeneration applications. We provide a brief overview of the common biomaterials, gelation mechanisms, and microfluidic device designs that are used to generate these microgels, and summarize the most recent works on how they are applied to tissue regeneration. Finally, we discuss future applications of microfluidic cell-laden microgels as well as existing challenges that should be resolved to stimulate their clinical application.",

        "Abstract": "Dying cells release nucleic acids (NA) and NA-containing complexes that activate inflammatory pathways of immune cells. Sustained activation of these pathways contributes to chronic inflammation frequently encountered in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In this study, grafting of cationic polymers onto a nanofibrous mesh enabled local scavenging of negatively charged pro-inflammatory molecules in the extracellular space. Nucleic acid scavenging nanofibers (NASFs) formed from poly(styrene-alt-maleic anhydride) conjugated with 1.8 kDa bPEI resulted in nanofibers of diameters 486 \u00b1 9 nm. NASFs inhibited the NF-\u03baB response stimulated by the negatively charged agonists, CpG and poly(I:C), in Ramos-blue cells but not Pam3CSK4, a nonanionic agonist. Moreover, NASFs significantly impeded NF-\u03baB activation in cells stimulated with damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) released from doxorubicin killed cancer cells. In vivo application of NASFs to open wounds demonstrated nucleic acid scavenging in wounds of diabetic mice infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting the in vivo efficacy of NASFs. This simple technique of generating NASF results in effective localized anti-inflammation in vitro and local nucleic acid scavenging in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Overexpression of exogenous fate-specifying transcription factors can directly reprogram differentiated somatic cells to target cell types. Here, we\u00a0show that similar reprogramming can also be achieved through the direct activation of endogenous genes using engineered CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activators. We use this approach to induce activation of the endogenous Brn2, Ascl1, and Myt1l genes (BAM factors) to convert mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced neuronal cells. This direct activation of endogenous genes rapidly remodeled the epigenetic state of the target loci and induced sustained endogenous gene expression during reprogramming. Thus, transcriptional activation and epigenetic remodeling of endogenous master transcription factors are sufficient for conversion between cell types. The rapid and sustained activation of endogenous genes in their native chromatin context by this approach may facilitate reprogramming with transient methods that avoid genomic integration and provides a new strategy for overcoming epigenetic barriers to cell fate specification.",

        "Title": "Inducing enhanced immunogenic cell death with nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems for pancreatic cancer therapy.",
        "Abstract": "Immunogenic cell death (ICD) occurs when apoptotic tumor cell elicits a specific immune response, which may trigger an anti-tumor effect, via the release of immunostimulatory damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Hypothesizing that nanomedicines may impact ICD due to their proven advantages in delivery of chemotherapeutics, we encapsulated oxaliplatin (OXA) or gemcitabine (GEM), an ICD and a non-ICD inducer respectively, into the amphiphilic diblock copolymer nanoparticles. Neither GEM nor nanoparticle-encapsulated GEM (NP-GEM) induced ICD, while both OXA and nanoparticle-encapsulated OXA (NP-OXA) induced ICD. Interestingly, NP-OXA treated tumor cells released more DAMPs and induced stronger immune responses of dendritic cells and T lymphocytes than OXA treatment in\u00a0vitro. Furthermore, OXA and NP-OXA exhibited stronger therapeutic effects in immunocompetent mice than in immunodeficient mice, and the enhancement of therapeutic efficacy was significantly higher in the NP-OXA group than the OXA group. Moreover, NP-OXA treatment induced a higher proportion of tumor infiltrating activated cytotoxic T-lymphocytes than OXA treatment. This general trend of enhanced ICD by nanoparticle delivery was corroborated in evaluating another pair of ICD inducer and non-ICD inducer, doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil. In conclusion, although nanoparticle encapsulation did not endow a non-ICD inducer with ICD-mediated anti-tumor capacity, treatment with a nanoparticle-encapsulated ICD inducer led to significantly enhanced ICD and consequently improved anti-tumor effects than the free ICD inducer. The proposed nanomedicine approach may impact cancer immunotherapy via the novel cell death mechanism of ICD.",

        "Abstract": "A unique interaction between the cyanine dye and negatively charged quantum dot is used to construct a signal-on biaptameric quantum dot (QD) F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) beacon for protein detection and distinct aptamer characterization. The beacon comprises a pair of aptamers, one intercalated with the cyanine dye (YOYO-3) and the other conjugated to a negatively charged, carboxyl-QD. When the target protein is present, structural folding and sandwich association of the two aptamers take place. As a consequence, YOYO-3 is displaced from the folded aptamer and transferred to the unblocked QD surface to yield a target concentration-dependent FRET signal. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the detection of thrombin ranging from nanomolar to submicromolar concentrations and confirm the dye translocation using cylindrical illumination confocal spectroscopy (CICS). The proposed beacon provides a simple, rapid, signal-on FRET detection for protein as well as a potential platform for distinct aptamer screening.",

        "Abstract": "The acquired resistance of human cancer cells to apoptosis is one of the defining hallmarks of cancer. Upregulated expression of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAP) has been implicated in drug resistance in several cancers. Survivin (encoded by BIRC5), the smallest member of the IAP family, has been correlated with both the control of cell apoptosis and regulation of cell mitosis in cancer. Owing to its critical role in regulation of cell survival and development of cancer resistance, as well as its distinguishingly high level of expression in many types of cancer, survivin has long been regarded as a promising therapeutic target for cancer therapy. This review first presents an overview of the mechanism by which survivin regulates cell function, followed by a discussion of the current state of survivin-targeted therapies. We focus on the application of nanoparticulate systems to deliver survivin inhibitors, co-delivery of survivin inhibitors with chemotherapeutic agents, synchronous targeting of survivin, other drug resistant molecules, and survivin regulators. We conclude by highlighting the current limitations associated with survivin-targeted therapies and speculating on the future strategies to surmount these impediments.",

        "Abstract": "Translation of any inventions into products requires manufacturing. Development of drug/gene/cell delivery systems will eventually face manufacturing challenges, which require the establishment of standardized processes to produce biologically-relevant products of high quality without incurring prohibitive cost. Microfluidicu technologies present many advantages to improve the quality of drug/gene/cell delivery systems. They also offer the benefits of automation. What remains unclear is whether they can meet the scale-up requirement. In this perspective, we discuss the advantages of microfluidic-assisted synthesis of nanoscale drug/gene delivery systems, formation of microscale drug/cell-encapsulated particles, generation of genetically engineered cells and fabrication of macroscale drug/cell-loaded micro-/nano-fibers. We also highlight the scale-up challenges one would face in adopting microfluidic technologies for the manufacturing of these therapeutic delivery systems.",

        "Abstract": "The development of stable, functional microvessels remains an important obstacle to overcome for tissue engineered organs and treatment of ischemia. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a promising cell source for vascular tissue engineering as they are readily obtainable and carry the potential to differentiate towards all endothelial phenotypes. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of human umbilical cord blood-derived EPCs to form vessel-like structures within a tissue engineering scaffold material, a cell-adhesive and proteolytically degradable poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel. EPCs in co-culture with angiogenic mural cells were encapsulated in hydrogel scaffolds by mixing with polymeric precursors and using a mild photocrosslinking process to form hydrogels with homogeneously dispersed cells. EPCs formed 3D microvessels networks that were stable for at least 30 days in culture, without the need for supplemental angiogenic growth factors. These 3D EPC microvessels displayed aspects of physiological microvasculature with lumen formation, expression of endothelial cell proteins (connexin 32, VE-cadherin, eNOS), basement membrane formation with collagen IV and laminin, perivascular investment of PDGFR-\u03b2 and \u03b1-SMA positive cells, and EPC quiescence (<1% proliferating cells) by 2 weeks of co-culture. Our findings demonstrate the development of a novel, reductionist system that is well-defined and reproducible for studying progenitor cell-driven microvessel formation.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatocyte spheroids microencapsulated in hydrogels can contribute to liver research in various capacities. The conventional approach of microencapsulating spheroids produces a variable number of spheroids per microgel and requires an extra step of spheroid loading into the gel. Here, a microfluidics technology bypassing the step of spheroid loading and controlling the spheroid characteristics is reported. Double-emulsion droplets are used to generate microencapsulated homotypic or heterotypic hepatocyte spheroids (all as single spheroids <200 \u03bcm in diameter) with enhanced functions in 4 h. The composition of the microgel is tunable as demonstrated by improved hepatocyte functions during 24 d culture (albumin secretion, urea secretion, and cytochrome P450 activity) when alginate-collagen composite hydrogel is used instead of alginate. Hepatocyte spheroids in alginate-collagen also perform better than hepatocytes cultured in collagen-sandwich configuration. Moreover, hepatocyte functions are significantly enhanced when hepatocytes and endothelial progenitor cells (used as a novel supporting cell source) are co-cultured to form composite spheroids at an optimal ratio of 5:1, which could be further boosted when encapsulated in alginate-collagen. This microencapsulated-spheroid formation technology with high yield, versatility, and uniformity is envisioned to be an enabling technology for liver tissue engineering as well as biomanufacturing.",

        "Abstract": "For the successful treatment of severe wounds, angiogenesis must be induced to provide a sufficient blood supply to the wound site. There have been many studies on various structural and biochemical factors regulating angiogenesis, such as surface topography, surface modifications, angiogenic factors, and various cell types. However, there is a paucity of research on the effects of micro- and nanoscale topography and the application of pericytes in angiogenesis. In this study, we utilized nanoscale topography combined with a triculture system consisting of human pericytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. We investigated the effects of the nanografted substrata and a triculture system on proangiogenic therapies in vitro. Human dermal fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were seeded with human pericytes from the placenta directly onto nanografted substrata composed of polydimethylsiloxane. We demonstrated that key elements of angiogenesis, including segment and capillary-like tubular structure formation, as well as the secretion of extracellular matrix, were increased by interaction between the nanografted substrata and the coculture containing pericytes. Thus, nanografted surfaces and triculture systems containing human pericytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells promote angiogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Engineered bacteria have great potential for medical and environmental applications. Fulfilling this potential requires controllability over engineered behaviors and scalability of the engineered systems. Here, we present a platform technology, microbial swarmbot, which employs spatial arrangement to control the growth dynamics of engineered bacteria. As a proof of principle, we demonstrated a safeguard strategy to prevent unintended bacterial proliferation. In particular, we adopted several synthetic gene circuits to program collective survival in Escherichia coli: the engineered bacteria could only survive when present at sufficiently high population densities. When encapsulated by permeable membranes, these bacteria can sense the local environment and respond accordingly. The cells inside the microbial swarmbot capsules will survive due to their high densities. Those escaping from a capsule, however, will be killed due to a decrease in their densities. We demonstrate that this design concept is modular and readily generalizable. Our work lays the foundation for engineering integrated and programmable control of hybrid biological-material systems for diverse applications.",

        "Abstract": "Access to smooth muscle cells (SMC) would create opportunities for tissue engineering, drug testing, and disease modeling. Herein we report the direct conversion of human endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) to induced smooth muscle cells (iSMC) by induced expression of MYOCD. The EPC undergo a cytoskeletal rearrangement resembling that of mesenchymal cells within 3 days post initiation of MYOCD expression. By day 7, the reprogrammed cells show upregulation of smooth muscle markers ACTA2, MYH11, and TAGLN by qRT-PCR and ACTA2 and MYH11 expression by immunofluorescence. By two weeks, they resemble umbilical artery SMC in microarray gene expression analysis. The iSMC, in contrast to EPC control, show calcium transients in response to phenylephrine stimulation and a contractility an order of magnitude higher than that of EPC as determined by traction force microscopy. Tissue-engineered blood vessels constructed using iSMC show functionality with respect to flow- and drug-mediated vasodilation and vasoconstriction.",

        "Abstract": "Safety concerns and/or the stochastic nature of current transduction approaches have hampered nuclear reprogramming's clinical translation. We report a novel non-viral nanotechnology-based platform permitting deterministic large-scale transfection with single-cell resolution. The superior capabilities of our technology are demonstrated by modification of the well-established direct neuronal reprogramming paradigm using overexpression of the transcription factors Brn2, Ascl1, and Myt1l (BAM). Reprogramming efficiencies were comparable to viral methodologies (up to ~9-12%) without the constraints of capsid size and with the ability to control plasmid dosage, in addition to showing superior performance relative to existing non-viral methods. Furthermore, increased neuronal complexity could be tailored by varying BAM ratio and by including additional proneural genes to the BAM cocktail. Furthermore, high-throughput NEP allowed easy interrogation of the reprogramming process. We discovered that BAM-mediated reprogramming is regulated by AsclI dosage, the S-phase cyclin CCNA2, and that some induced neurons passed through a nestin-positive cell stage.",

        "Abstract": "Burn injuries in the United States account for over one million hospital admissions per year, with treatment estimated at four billion dollars. Of severe burn patients, 30-90% will develop hypertrophic scars (HSc). In this study, we evaluate the impact of an elastomeric, randomly-oriented biostable polyurethane (PU) scaffold on HSc-related outcomes. In vitro, fibroblast-seeded PU scaffolds contracted significantly less and demonstrated fewer \u03b1SMA(+) myofibroblasts compared to fibroblast-seeded collagen lattices. In a murine HSc model, collagen coated PU (ccPU) scaffolds significantly reduced HSc contraction as compared to untreated control wounds and wounds treated with the clinical standard of care. Our data suggest that electrospun ccPU scaffolds meet the requirements to reduce HSc contraction including reduction of in vitro HSc related outcomes, diminished scar stiffness, and reduced scar contraction. While clinical dogma suggests treating severe burn patients with rapidly biodegrading skin equivalents, our data suggest that a more long-term scaffold may possess merit in reducing HSc.",

        "Abstract": "Tissue-engineered blood vessels (TEBV) can serve as vascular grafts and may also play an important role in the development of organs-on-a-chip. Most TEBV construction involves scaffolding with biomaterials such as collagen gel or electrospun fibrous mesh. Hypothesizing that a scaffold-free TEBV may be advantageous, we constructed a tubular structure (1\u2009mm i.d.) from aligned human mesenchymal cell sheets (hMSC) as the wall and human endothelial progenitor cell (hEPC) coating as the lumen. The burst pressure of the scaffold-free TEBV was above 200\u2009mmHg after three weeks of sequential culture in a rotating wall bioreactor and perfusion at 6.8 dynes/cm(2). The interwoven organization of the cell layers and extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) formation of the hMSC-based TEBV resembled that of native blood vessels. The TEBV exhibited flow-mediated vasodilation, vasoconstriction after exposure to 1\u2009\u03bcM phenylephrine and released nitric oxide in a manner similar to that of porcine femoral vein. HL-60 cells attached to the TEBV lumen after TNF-\u03b1 activation to suggest a functional endothelium. This study demonstrates the potential of a hEPC endothelialized hMSC-based TEBV for drug screening.",

        "Title": "Smart multifunctional drug delivery towards anticancer therapy harmonized in mesoporous nanoparticles.",
        "Abstract": "Nanomedicine seeks to apply nanoscale materials for the therapy and diagnosis of diseased and damaged tissues. Recent advances in nanotechnology have made a major contribution to the development of multifunctional nanomaterials, which represents a paradigm shift from single purpose to multipurpose materials. Multifunctional nanomaterials have been proposed to enable simultaneous target imaging and on-demand delivery of therapeutic agents only to the specific site. Most advanced systems are also responsive to internal or external stimuli. This approach is particularly important for highly potent drugs (e.g. chemotherapeutics), which should be delivered in a discreet manner and interact with cells/tissues only locally. Both advances in imaging and precisely controlled and localized delivery are critically important in cancer treatment, and the use of such systems - theranostics - holds great promise to minimise side effects and boost therapeutic effectiveness of the treatment. Among others, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) are considered one of the most promising nanomaterials for drug delivery. Due to their unique intrinsic features, including tunable porosity and size, large surface area, structural diversity, easily modifiable chemistry and suitability for functionalization, and biocompatibility, MSNPs have been extensively utilized as multifunctional nanocarrier systems. The combination or hybridization with biomolecules, drugs, and other nanoparticles potentiated the ability of MSNPs towards multifunctionality, and even smart actions stimulated by specified signals, including pH, optical signal, redox reaction, electricity and magnetism. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art of multifunctional, smart drug delivery systems centered on advanced MSNPs, with special emphasis on cancer related applications.",

        "Abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA) directs post-transcriptional regulation of a network of genes by targeting mRNA. Although relatively recent in development, many miRNAs direct differentiation of various stem cells including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a major player in regenerative medicine. An effective and safe delivery of miRNA holds the key to translating miRNA technologies. Both viral and nonviral delivery systems have seen success in miRNA delivery, and each approach possesses advantages and disadvantages. A number of studies have demonstrated success in augmenting osteogenesis, improving cardiogenesis, and reducing fibrosis among many other tissue engineering applications. A scaffold-based approach with the possibility of local and sustained delivery of miRNA is particularly attractive since the physical cues provided by the scaffold may synergize with the biochemical cues induced by miRNA therapy. Herein, we first briefly cover the application of miRNA to direct stem cell fate via replacement and inhibition therapies, followed by the discussion of the promising viral and nonviral delivery systems. Next we present the unique advantages of a scaffold-based delivery in achieving lineage-specific differentiation and tissue development.",

        "Abstract": "Culturing and measuring bacterial population dynamics are critical to develop insights into gene regulation or bacterial physiology. Traditional methods, based on bulk culture to obtain such quantification, have the limitations of higher cost/volume of reagents, non-amendable to small size of population and more laborious manipulation. To this end, droplet-based microfluidics represents a promising alternative that is cost-effective and high-throughput. However, difficulties in manipulating the droplet environment and monitoring encapsulated bacterial population for long-term experiments limit its utilization. To overcome these limitations, we used an electrode-free injection technology to modulate the chemical environment in droplets. This ability is critical for precise control of bacterial dynamics in droplets. Moreover, we developed a trapping device for long-term monitoring of population dynamics in individual droplets for at least 240\u00a0h. We demonstrated the utility of this new microfluidic system by quantifying population dynamics of natural and engineered bacteria. Our approach can further improve the analysis for systems and synthetic biology in terms of manipulability and high temporal resolution.",

        "Abstract": "As a newly developed assay for the detection of endogenous enzyme activity at the single-catalytic-event level, Rolling Circle Enhanced Enzyme Activity Detection (REEAD) has been used to measure enzyme activity in both single human cells and malaria-causing parasites, Plasmodium sp. Current REEAD assays rely on organic dye-tagged linear DNA probes to report the rolling circle amplification products (RCPs), the cost of which may hinder the widespread use of REEAD. Here we show that a new class of activatable probes, NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs), can simplify the REEAD assays. Easily prepared without any need for purification and capable of large fluorescence enhancement upon hybridization, NCBs are cost-effective and sensitive. Compared to conventional fluorescent probes, NCBs are also more photostable. As demonstrated in reporting the human topoisomerases I (hTopI) cleavage-ligation reaction, the proposed NCBs suggest a read-out format attractive for future REEAD-based diagnostics.",

        "Abstract": "Regenerative medicine has the potential to drastically change the field of health care from reactive to preventative and restorative. Exciting advances in stem cell biology and cellular reprogramming have fueled the progress of this field. Biochemical cues in the form of small molecule drugs, growth factors, zinc finger protein transcription factors and nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, monoclonal antibodies, plasmid DNA, aptamers, or RNA interference agents can play an important role to influence stem cell differentiation and the outcome of tissue regeneration. Many of these biochemical factors are fragile and must act intracellularly at the molecular level. They require an effective delivery system, which can take the form of a scaffold (e.g., hydrogels and electrospun fibers), carrier (viral and nonviral), nano- and microparticle, or genetically modified cell. In this review, we will discuss the history and current technologies of drug, protein, and gene delivery in the context of regenerative medicine. Next, we will present case examples of how delivery technologies are being applied to promote angiogenesis in nonhealing wounds or prevent angiogenesis in age related macular degeneration. Finally, we will conclude with a brief discussion of the regulatory pathway from bench to bedside for the clinical translation of these novel therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Researchers have applied mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to a variety of therapeutic scenarios by harnessing their multipotent, regenerative, and immunosuppressive properties with tropisms toward inflamed, hypoxic, and cancerous sites. Although MSC-based therapies have been shown to be safe and effective to a certain degree, the efficacy remains low in most cases when MSC are applied alone. To enhance their therapeutic efficacy, researchers have equipped MSC with targeted delivery functions using genetic engineering, therapeutic agent incorporation, and cell surface modification. MSC can be genetically modified virally or non-virally to overexpress therapeutic proteins that complement their innate properties. MSC can also be primed with non-peptidic drugs or magnetic nanoparticles for enhanced efficacy and externally regulated targeting, respectively. Furthermore, MSC can be functionalized with targeting moieties to augment their homing toward therapeutic sites using enzymatic modification, chemical conjugation, or non-covalent interactions. These engineering techniques are still works in progress, requiring optimization to improve the therapeutic efficacy and targeting effectiveness while minimizing any loss of MSC function. In this review, we will highlight the advanced techniques of engineering MSC, describe their promise and the challenges of translation into clinical settings, and suggest future perspectives on realizing their full potential for MSC-based therapy.",

Many proof-of-concept studies on applying aptamers to drug delivery, gene therapy, and cancer imaging have shown promising efficacy and impressive safety in vivo toward translation. Yet, there remains ample room for improvement and critical barriers to be addressed. In this review, we will first introduce the recent progress in clinical trials of aptamer nanomedicine, followed by a discussion of the barriers at the design and in vivo application stages.

        "Title": "Plant-based oral tolerance to hemophilia therapy employs a complex immune regulatory response including LAP+CD4+ T cells.",
        "Abstract": "Coagulation factor replacement therapy for the X-linked bleeding disorder hemophilia is severely complicated by antibody (\"inhibitor\") formation. We previously found that oral delivery to hemophilic mice of cholera toxin B subunit-coagulation factor fusion proteins expressed in chloroplasts of transgenic plants suppressed inhibitor formation directed against factors VIII and IX and anaphylaxis against factor IX (FIX). This observation and the relatively high concentration of antigen in the chloroplasts prompted us to evaluate the underlying tolerance mechanisms. The combination of oral delivery of bioencapsulated FIX and intravenous replacement therapy induced a complex, interleukin-10 (IL-10)-dependent, antigen-specific systemic immune suppression of pathogenic antibody formation (immunoglobulin [Ig] 1/inhibitors, IgE) in hemophilia B mice. Tolerance induction was also successful in preimmune mice but required prolonged oral delivery once replacement therapy was resumed. Orally delivered antigen, initially targeted to epithelial cells, was taken up by dendritic cells throughout the small intestine and additionally by F4/80(+) cells in the duodenum. Consistent with the immunomodulatory responses, frequencies of tolerogenic CD103(+) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells were increased. Ultimately, latency-associated peptide expressing CD4(+) regulatory T cells (CD4(+)CD25(-)LAP(+) cells with upregulated IL-10 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) expression) as well as conventional CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells systemically suppressed anti-FIX responses.",

        "Abstract": "We demonstrated the surface functionalization of a highly three-dimensional, superhydrophilic wicking substrate using light to immobilize functional biomolecules for sensor or microarray applications. We showed here that the three-dimensional substrate was compatible with photo-attachment and the performance of functionalization was greatly improved due to both increased surface capacity and reduced substrate reflectivity. In addition, photo-attachment circumvents the problems induced by wicking effect that was typically encountered on superhydrophilic three-dimensional substrates, thus reducing the difficulty of producing miniaturized sites on such substrate. We have investigated various aspects of photo-attachment process on the nanowire substrate, including the role of different buffers, the effect of wavelength as well as how changing probe structure may affect the functionalization process. We demonstrated that substrate fabrication and functionalization can be achieved with processes compatible with microelectronics processes, hence reducing the cost of array fabrication. Such functionalization method coupled with the high capacity surface makes the substrate an ideal candidate for sensor or microarray for sensitive detection of target analytes.",

        "Title": "Mitigation of hypertrophic scar contraction via an elastomeric biodegradable scaffold.",
        "Abstract": "Hypertrophic scar (HSc) occurs in 40-70% of patients treated for third degree burn injuries. Current burn therapies rely upon the use of bioengineered skin equivalents (BSEs), which assist in wound healing but do not prevent HSc contraction. HSc contraction leads to formation of a fixed, inelastic skin deformity. We propose that BSEs should maintain their architecture in the wound bed throughout the remodeling phase of repair to prevent HSc contraction. In this work we study a degradable, elastomeric, randomly oriented, electrospun micro-fibrous scaffold fabricated from the copolymer poly(l-lactide-co-\u03b5-caprolactone) (PLCL). PLCL scaffolds displayed appropriate elastomeric and tensile characteristics for implantation beneath a human skin graft. In\u00a0vitro analysis using human dermal fibroblasts demonstrated that PLCL scaffolds decreased myofibroblast formation as compared to an in\u00a0vitro HSc contraction model. Using a validated immune-competent murine HSc contraction model, we found that HSc contraction was significantly greater in animals treated with standard of care, Integra, as compared to those treated with collagen coated-PLCL (ccPLCL) scaffolds. Finally, wounds treated with ccPLCL were significantly less stiff than control wounds at d30 in\u00a0vivo. Together, these data suggest that scaffolds which persist throughout the remodeling phase of repair may represent a clinically translatable method to prevent HSc contraction.",

The aim of this research is to discover biocompatible materials and drugs that can promote cell migration in the wound area and thus enhance desirable wound healing effects. In this paper, we report that PDMS nanogratings could accelerate the migration of epithelial cells along the grating axis, and the addition of Imatinib could further increase the epithelial cell wound healing speed to 1.6 times the speed of control cells. We also demonstrate that this migration is mediated by lamellipodia protrusion, and is Rac1-GTPase activity dependent. Lastly, we discuss the potential application and prospect of different nanostructured biomaterials for wound healing studies.",

Although studies have demonstrated the role of focal adhesions in topography-mediated changes of gene expression, information linking substrate topography to the nucleus remains scarce. Here we show by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and western blotting that A-type lamins and retinoblastoma protein are downregulated in mesenchymal stem/stromal cells cultured on 350 nm gratings compared to planar substrates; these changes lead to a decrease in proliferation and changes in differentiation potential.",

        "Abstract": "The limited regenerative capacity of articular cartilage contributes to progressive joint dysfunction associated with cartilage injury or osteoarthritis. Cartilage tissue engineering seeks to provide a biological substitute for repairing damaged or diseased cartilage, but requires a cell source with the capacity for extensive expansion without loss of chondrogenic potential. In this study, we hypothesized that decreased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 would enhance the proliferative and chondrogenic potential of differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Murine iPSCs were directed to differentiate toward the chondrogenic lineage with an established protocol and then engineered to express a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to reduce the expression of p21. Cells expressing the p21 shRNA demonstrated higher proliferative potential during monolayer expansion and increased synthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in pellet cultures. Furthermore, these cells could be expanded \u223c150-fold over three additional passages without a reduction in the subsequent production of GAGs, while control cells showed reduced potential for GAG synthesis with three additional passages. In pellets from extensively passaged cells, knockdown of p21 attenuated the sharp decrease in cell number that occurred in control cells, and immunohistochemical analysis showed that p21 knockdown limited the production of type I and type X collagen while maintaining synthesis of cartilage-specific type II collagen. These findings suggest that manipulating the cell cycle can augment the monolayer expansion and preserve the chondrogenic capacity of differentiated iPSCs, providing a strategy for enhancing iPSC-based cartilage tissue engineering.",

        "Abstract": "Transgene insertion plays an important role in gene therapy and in biological studies. Transposon-based systems that integrate transgenes by transposase-catalyzed \"cut-and-paste\" mechanism have emerged as an attractive system for transgenesis. Hyperactive piggyBac transposon is particularly promising due to its ability to integrate large transgenes with high efficiency. However, prolonged expression of transposase can become a potential source of genotoxic effects due to uncontrolled transposition of the integrated transgene from one chromosomal locus to another. In this study we propose a vector design to decrease post-transposition expression of transposase and to eliminate the cells that have residual transposase expression. We design a single plasmid construct that combines the transposase and the transpositioning transgene element to share a single polyA sequence for termination. Consequently, the separation of the transposase element from the polyA sequence after transposition leads to its deactivation. We also co-express Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) with the transposase. Therefore, cells having residual transposase expression can be eliminated by the administration of ganciclovir. We demonstrate the utility of this combination transposon system by integrating and expressing a model therapeutic gene, human coagulation Factor IX, in HEK293T cells.",

The objective of this study is to create a purely natural, uniform, and highly aligned nanofibrous ECM scaffold for potential tissue engineering applications. Synthetic nanogratings (130 nm in depth) were used to direct the growth of human dermal fibroblasts for up to 8 weeks, resulting in a uniform 70 \u03bcm-thick fibroblast cell sheet with highly aligned cells and ECM nanofibers. A natural ECM scaffold with uniformly aligned nanofibers of 78 \u00b1 9 nm in diameter was generated after removing the cellular components from the detached fibroblast sheet. The elastic modulus of the scaffold was well maintained after the decellularization process because of the preservation of elastin fibers. Reseeding human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) showed the excellent capacity of the scaffold in directing and supporting cell alignment and proliferation along the underlying fibers. The scaffold's biocompatibility was further examined by an ",

Targeted activation of the endogenous Myod1 gene locus with this system led to stable and sustained reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into skeletal myocytes.

        "Abstract": "Hypertrophic scar (HSc) contraction following burn injury causes contractures. Contractures are painful and disfiguring. Current therapies are marginally effective. To study pathogenesis and develop new therapies, a murine model is needed. We have created a validated immune-competent murine HSc model. A third-degree burn was created on dorsum of C57BL/6 mice. Three days postburn, tissue was excised and grafted with ear skin. Graft contraction was analyzed and tissue harvested on different time points. Outcomes were compared with human condition to validate the model. To confirm graft survival, green fluorescent protein (GFP) mice were used, and histologic analysis was performed to differentiate between ear and back skin. Role of panniculus carnosus in contraction was analyzed. Cellularity was assessed with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Collagen maturation was assessed with Picro-sirius red. Mast cells were stained with Toluidine blue. Macrophages were detected with F4/80 immune. Vascularity was assessed with CD31 immune. RNA for contractile proteins was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Elastic moduli of skin and scar tissue were analyzed using a microstrain analyzer. Grafts contracted to \u223c45% of their original size by day 14 and maintained their size. Grafting of GFP mouse skin onto wild-type mice, and analysis of dermal thickness and hair follicle density, confirmed graft survival. Interestingly, hair follicles disappeared after grafting and regenerated in ear skin configuration by day 30. Radiological analysis revealed that panniculus carnosus doesn't contribute to contraction. Microscopic analyses showed that grafts show increase in cellularity. Granulation tissue formed after day 3. Collagen analysis revealed increases in collagen maturation over time. CD31 stain revealed increased vascularity. Macrophages and mast cells were increased. qRT-PCR showed up-regulation of transforming growth factor beta, alpha smooth muscle actin, and rho-associated protein kinase 2 in HSc. Tensile testing revealed that human skin and scar tissues are tougher than mouse skin and scar tissues.",

        "Abstract": "Shape-controlled synthesis of nanomaterials through a simple, continuous, and low-cost method is essential to nanomaterials research toward practical applications. Hydrodynamic focusing, with its advantages of simplicity, low-cost, and precise control over reaction conditions, has been used for nanomaterial synthesis. While most studies have focused on improving the uniformity and size control, few have addressed the potential of tuning the shape of the synthesized nanomaterials. Here we demonstrate a facile method to synthesize hybrid materials by three-dimensional hydrodynamic focusing (3D-HF). While keeping the flow rates of the reagents constant and changing only the flow rate of the buffer solution, the molar ratio of two reactants (i.e., tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and HAuCl4) within the reaction zone varies. The synthesized TTF-Au hybrid materials possess very different and predictable morphologies. The reaction conditions at different buffer flow rates are studied through computational simulation, and the formation mechanisms of different structures are discussed. This simple one-step method to achieve continuous shape-tunable synthesis highlights the potential of 3D-HF in nanomaterials research.",

        "Abstract": "Inhibiting specific gene expression by short interfering RNA (siRNA) offers a new therapeutic strategy to tackle many diseases, including cancer, metabolic disorders, and viral infections, at the molecular level. The macromolecular and polar nature of siRNA hinders its cellular access to exert its effect. Nanoparticulate delivery systems can promote efficient intracellular delivery. Despite showing promise in many preclinical studies and potential in some clinical trials, siRNA has poor delivery efficiency, which continues to demand innovations, from carrier design to formulation, in order to overcome transport barriers. Previous findings for optimal plasmid DNA delivery cannot be generalized to siRNA delivery owing to significant discrepancy in size and subtle differences in chain flexibility between the two types of nucleic acids. In this review, we highlight the recent advances in improving the stability of siRNA nanoparticles, understanding their intracellular trafficking and release mechanisms, and applying judiciously the promising formulations to disease models.",

A growing number of studies applying nanomedicine concepts to mRNA tumour vaccination show that the mRNA delivered in nanoparticle format can generate a more robust immune response. Advances in the past decade have deepened our understanding of gene delivery barriers, mRNA's biological stability and immunological properties, and support the notion for engineering innovations tailored towards a more efficient mRNA nanoparticle vaccine delivery system. In this review we will first examine the suitability of mRNA for engineering manipulations, followed by discussion of a model framework that highlights the barriers to a robust anti-tumour immunity mediated by mRNA encapsulated in nanoparticles. Finally, by consolidating existing literature on mRNA nanoparticle tumour vaccination within the context of this framework, we aim to identify bottlenecks that can be addressed by future nanoengineering research.",

Notably, intravenous and subcutaneous injections are the only routes of administration tested for mRNA nanoparticle tumor vaccination. In this report, we demonstrate that tumor immunity can be achieved via nasal administration of mRNA. Mice nasally immunized with mRNA delivered in nanoparticle format demonstrate delayed tumor progression in both prophylactic and therapeutic immunization models. The observed tumor immunity correlates with splenic antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and is achieved only when mRNA is delivered in nanoparticle but not in naked format. In conclusion, we demonstrate, as a proof-of-concept, a non-invasive approach to mRNA tumor vaccination, increasing its potential as a broadly applicable and off-the-shelf therapy for cancer treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Co-delivery is a rapidly growing sector of drug delivery that aspires to enhance therapeutic efficacy through controlled delivery of diverse therapeutic cargoes with synergistic activities. It requires the design of carriers capable of simultaneously transporting to and releasing multiple therapeutics at a disease site. Co-delivery has arisen from the emerging trend of combination therapy, where treatment with two or more therapeutics at the same time can succeed where single therapeutics fail. However, conventional combination therapy offers little control over achieving an optimized therapeutic ratio at the target site. Co-delivery via inclusion of multiple therapeutic cargos within the same carrier addresses this issue by not only ensuring delivery of both therapeutics to the same cell, but also offering a platform for control of the delivery process, from loading to release. Co-delivery systems have been formulated using a number of carriers previously developed for single-therapeutic delivery. Liposomes, polymeric micelles, PLGA nanoparticles, and dendrimers have all been adapted for co-delivery. Much of the effort focuses on dealing with drugs having dissimilar properties, increasing loading efficiencies, and controlling loading and release ratios. In this review, we highlight the innovations in carrier designs and formulations to deliver combination cargoes of drug/drug, drug/siRNA, and drug/pDNA toward disease therapy. With rapid advances in mechanistic understanding of interrelating molecular pathways and development of molecular medicine, the future of co-delivery will become increasingly promising and prominent.",

        "Abstract": "Cellular reprogramming holds tremendous potential for cell therapy and regenerative medicine. Recently, fibroblasts have been directly converted into induced neurons (iNs) by overexpression of the neuronal transcription factors Ascl1, Brn2 and Myt1L. Hypothesizing that cell-topography interactions could influence the fibroblast-to-neuron reprogramming process, we investigated the effects of various topographies on iNs produced by direct reprogramming. Final iN purity and conversion efficiency were increased on micrograting substrates. Neurite branching was increased on microposts and decreased on microgratings, with a simplified dendritic arbor characterized by the reduction of MAP2(+) neurites. Neurite outgrowth increased significantly on various topographies. DNA microarray analysis detected 20 differentially expressed genes in iNs reprogrammed on smooth versus microgratings, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed the upregulation of Vip and downregulation of Thy1 and Bmp5 on microgratings. Electrophysiology and calcium imaging verified the functionality of these iNs. This study demonstrates the potential of applying topographical cues to optimize cellular reprogramming.",

        "Abstract": "Microemulsion represents an attractive platform for fundamental and applied biomedical research because the emulsified droplets can serve as millions of compartmentalized micrometer-sized reactors amenable to high-throughput screening or online monitoring. However, establishing stable emulsions with surfactants that are compatible with biological applications remains a significant challenge. Motivated by the lack of commercially available surfactants suitable for microemulsion-based biological assays, this study describes the facile synthesis of a biocompatible fluorosurfactant with nonionic tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl (Tris) polar head groups. We have further demonstrated compatibility of the developed surfactant with diverse emulsion-based applications, including DNA polymeric nanoparticle synthesis, enzymatic activity assay, and bacterial or mammalian cell culture, in the setup of both double- and multiphases of emulsions.",

        "Abstract": "Microphysiological systems provide a tool to simulate normal and pathological function of organs for prolonged periods. These systems must incorporate the key functions of the individual organs and enable interactions among the corresponding microphysiological units. The relative size of different microphysiological organs and their flow rates are scaled in proportion to in vivo values. We have developed a microphysiological three-dimensional engineered human skeletal muscle system connected to a circulatory system that consists of a tissue-engineered blood vessel as part of a high-pressure arterial system. The engineered human skeletal muscle tissue reproduces key mechanical behaviors of skeletal muscle in vivo. Pulsatile flow is produced using a novel computer-controlled magnetically activated ferrogel. The system is versatile and the muscle unit can be integrated with other organ systems. Periodic monitoring of biomechanical function provides a non-invasive assessment of the health of the tissue and a way to measure the response to drugs and toxins.",

        "Abstract": "Successful intracellular delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics relies on multiaspect optimization, one of which is formulation. While there has been ample innovation on chemical design of polymeric gene carriers, the same cannot be said for physical processing of polymer-DNA nanocomplexes (polyplexes). Conventional synthesis of polyplexes by bulk mixing depends on the operators' experience. The poorly controlled bulk mixing process may also lead to batch-to-batch variation and consequent irreproducibility. Here, we synthesize polyplexes by using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic focusing (3D-HF) technique in a single-layered, planar microfluidic device. Without any additional chemical treatment or postprocessing, the polyplexes prepared by the 3D-HF method show smaller size, slower aggregation rate, and higher transfection efficiency, while exhibiting reduced cytotoxicity compared to the ones synthesized by conventional bulk mixing. In addition, by introducing external acoustic perturbation, mixing can be further enhanced, leading to even smaller nanocomplexes. The 3D-HF method provides a simple and reproducible process for synthesizing high-quality polyplexes, addressing a critical barrier in the eventual translation of nucleic acid therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "An attractive option for tissue engineering is to use of multicellular spheroids as microtissues, particularly with stem cell spheroids. Conventional approaches of fabricating spheroids suffer from low throughput and polydispersity in size, and fail to supplement cues from extracellular matrix (ECM) for enhanced differentiation. In this study, we report the application of microfluidics-generated water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) double-emulsion (DE) droplets as pico-liter sized bioreactor for rapid cell assembly and well-controlled microenvironment for spheroid culture. Cells aggregated to form size-controllable (30-80 \u03bcm) spheroids in DE droplets within 150 min and could be retrieved via a droplet-releasing agent. Moreover, precursor hydrogel solution can be adopted as the inner phase to produce spheroid-encapsulated microgels after spheroid formation. As an example, the encapsulation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) spheroids in alginate and alginate-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (-RGD) microgel was demonstrated, with enhanced osteogenic differentiation further exhibited in the latter case.",

        "Abstract": "We developed a microfluidic flow-control system capable of dynamically generating various flow patterns on demand. The flow-control system is based on novel magnetoactive sponges embedded in microfluidic flow channels. Applying a non-uniform magnetic field compresses the magnetoactive sponge, significantly reducing porosity and hydraulic conductivity. Tuning the applied magnetic field can dynamically vary the flow rate in the microfluidic channel. Pulsatile and physiological flow patterns with frequency between 1 and 3 Hz, flow rates between 0.5 and 10 \u03bcL min(-1) and duration over 3 weeks have been achieved. Smooth muscle cells in engineered blood vessels perfused for 7 days aligned perpendicular to the flow direction under pulsatile but not steady flow, similar to the in vivo orientation. Owing to its various advantages over traditional flow-control methods, the new system potentially has important applications in microfluidic-based microphysiological systems to simulate the physiological nature of blood flow.",

        "Abstract": "As the designs of polymer systems used to deliver nucleic acids continue to evolve, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the basic bulk manufacturing techniques of the past will be insufficient to produce polymer-nucleic acid nanocomplexes that possess the uniformity, stability, and potency required for their successful clinical translation and widespread commercialization. Traditional bulk-prepared products are often physicochemically heterogeneous and may vary significantly from one batch to the next. Here we show that preparation of bioreducible nanocomplexes with an emulsion-based droplet microfluidic system produces significantly improved nanoparticles that are up to fifty percent smaller, more uniform, and are less prone to aggregation. The intracellular integrity of nanocomplexes prepared with this microfluidic method is significantly prolonged, as detected using a high-throughput flow cytometric quantum dot F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer nanosensor system. These physical attributes conspire to consistently enhance the delivery of both plasmid DNA and messenger RNA payloads in stem cells, primary cells, and human cell lines. Innovation in processing is necessary to move the field toward the broader clinical implementation of safe and effective nonviral nucleic acid therapeutics, and preparation with droplet microfluidics represents a step forward in addressing the critical barrier of robust and reproducible nanocomplex production.",

        "Abstract": "We demonstrate temperature-controlled encapsulation and release of the enzyme horseradish peroxidase using a preassembled and covalently closed three-dimensional DNA cage structure as a controllable encapsulation device. The utilized cage structure was covalently closed and composed of 12 double-stranded B-DNA helices that constituted the edges of the structure. The double stranded helices were interrupted by short single-stranded thymidine linkers constituting the cage corners except for one, which was composed by four 32 nucleotide long stretches of DNA with a sequence that allowed them to fold into hairpin structures. As demonstrated by gel-electrophoretic and fluorophore-quenching experiments this design imposed a temperature-controlled conformational transition capability to the structure, which allowed entrance or release of an enzyme cargo at 37 \u00b0C while ensuring retainment of the cargo in the central cavity of the cage at 4 \u00b0C. The entrapped enzyme was catalytically active inside the DNA cage and was able to convert substrate molecules penetrating the apertures in the DNA lattice that surrounded the central cavity of the cage.",

However, SnO2 suffers from low band edge that causes severe backflow of electrons towards electrolyte (charge recombination). Herein, we demonstrate that gallium (Ga) doping can increase the band edge of SnO2, and we show that DSSCs using a Ga-doped SnO2 nano-cuboids based photoanode offer improved open circuit potential (~0.74 V), fill factor (~73.7%), and power conversion efficiency (~4.05%).",

        "Abstract": "Electrodeposited nanorods serving as multivalent bridges were fabricated and surface-decorated with ligands for immune cells. Gold and nickel solutions were sequentially electrodeposited on nanoporous anodized disc templates and the template was dissolved to retrieve bisegmented nanorods with different lengths. Gold and nickel segmented nanorods were surface-immobilized with mannose and RGD peptides to prepare immune-cell recruiting nanorods. Surface-functionalization of nanorods were confirmed by fluorescence-labeling of each ligands and confocal microscopy. Dendritic cells and T cells were co-incubated with the surface-functionalized nanorods, and the proximity between the nanorods and the immune cells was visualized by variable pressure scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. The long nanorods were associated with the immune cells, whereas the shorter nanorods were rather endocytosed by cells, suggesting a feasibility of the longer nanorods as bridging for the cells. Cytokine releases from the immune cells were monitored by cultivating lipopolysaccharide-activated dendritic cells with T cells. Interleukine-2 and interferon-\u03b3 release profiles showed a strong correlation with the length of the nanorod, where the 4 \u03bcm nanorods induced the highest levels of cytokine release compared to 1 or 2 \u03bcm nanorods. Thus, we concluded that the proximity of the immune cells increased by bridging the immune cells with the nanobridging system, which subsequently increased cytokine release by facilitating the antigen presentation process.",

        "Title": "Differentiation of mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into nucleus pulposus-like cells in vitro.",
        "Abstract": "A large percentage of the population may be expected to experience painful symptoms or disability associated with intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration - a condition characterized by diminished integrity of tissue components. Great interest exists in the use of autologous or allogeneic cells delivered to the degenerated IVD to promote matrix regeneration. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), derived from a patient's own somatic cells, have demonstrated their capacity to differentiate into various cell types although their potential to differentiate into an IVD cell has not yet been demonstrated. The overall objective of this study was to assess the possibility of generating iPSC-derived nucleus pulposus (NP) cells in a mouse model, a cell population that is entirely derived from notochord. This study employed magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) to isolate a CD24(+) iPSC subpopulation. Notochordal cell-related gene expression was analyzed in this CD24(+) cell fraction via real time RT-PCR. CD24(+) iPSCs were then cultured in a laminin-rich culture system for up to 28 days, and the mouse NP phenotype was assessed by immunostaining. This study also focused on producing a more conducive environment for NP differentiation of mouse iPSCs with addition of low oxygen tension and notochordal cell conditioned medium (NCCM) to the culture platform. iPSCs were evaluated for an ability to adopt an NP-like phenotype through a combination of immunostaining and biochemical assays. Results demonstrated that a CD24(+) fraction of mouse iPSCs could be retrieved and differentiated into a population that could synthesize matrix components similar to that in native NP. Likewise, the addition of a hypoxic environment and NCCM induced a similar phenotypic result. In conclusion, this study suggests that mouse iPSCs have the potential to differentiate into NP-like cells and suggests the possibility that they may be used as a novel cell source for cellular therapy in the IVD.",

        "Title": "Nonendocytic delivery of lipoplex nanoparticles into living cells using nanochannel electroporation.",
        "Abstract": "The delivery of biomolecules, including siRNAs (\u224821 bp) and large plasmids (\u224810 kbp), into living cells holds a great promise for therapeutic and research applications. Lipoplex nanoparticles are popular nanocarriers for gene delivery. In conventional transfection methods, the cellular uptake of lipoplex nanoparticels occurs through the endocytosis process. The entrapment of lipoplex nanoparticles into endocytic vesicle is a major barrier in achieving efficient gene silencing and expression. Here, a novel nanochannel electroporation (NEP) method is employed to facilitate the cellular uptake and release of siRNAs/DNAs from lipoplexes. First, it is demonstrated that in a NEP device, lipoplex nanoparticles can be injected directly into the cell cytoplasm within several seconds. Specifically, it is found that lipoplexes containing MCL-1 siRNA delivered by NEP can more efficiently down-regulate the expression of MCL-1 mRNA in A549 cancer cells than conventional transfection. Quantum dot-mediated F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (QD-FRET) reveals that lipoplexes delivered via NEP can directly release siRNA in the cytoplasm without going through the endocytosis route, which unravels the responsible mechanism for efficient gene delivery. Furthermore, the advantage of combining NEP with lipoplex nanoparticles by the successful delivery of large plasmids (pCAG2LMKOSimO, 13 kbp) into CHO cells is demonstrated.",

        "Title": "Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitors differentiate to cardiomyocytes and form biosynthetic tissues.",
        "Abstract": "The mammalian heart has little capacity to regenerate, and following injury the myocardium is replaced by non-contractile scar tissue. Consequently, increased wall stress and workload on the remaining myocardium leads to chamber dilation, dysfunction, and heart failure. Cell-based therapy with an autologous, epigenetically reprogrammed, and cardiac-committed progenitor cell source could potentially reverse this process by replacing the damaged myocardium with functional tissue. However, it is unclear whether cardiac progenitor cell-derived cardiomyocytes are capable of attaining levels of structural and functional maturity comparable to that of terminally-fated cardiomyocytes. Here, we first describe the derivation of mouse induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which once differentiated allow for the enrichment of Nkx2-5(+) cardiac progenitors, and the cardiomyocyte-specific expression of the red fluorescent protein. We show that the cardiac progenitors are multipotent and capable of differentiating into endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes. Moreover, cardiac progenitor selection corresponds to cKit(+) cell enrichment, while cardiomyocyte cell-lineage commitment is concomitant with dual expression of either cKit/Flk1 or cKit/Sca-1. We proceed to show that the cardiac progenitor-derived cardiomyocytes are capable of forming electrically and mechanically coupled large-scale 2D cell cultures with mature electrophysiological properties. Finally, we examine the cell progenitors' ability to form electromechanically coherent macroscopic tissues, using a physiologically relevant 3D culture model and demonstrate that following long-term culture the cardiomyocytes align, and form robust electromechanical connections throughout the volume of the biosynthetic tissue construct. We conclude that the iPS cell-derived cardiac progenitors are a robust cell source for tissue engineering applications and a 3D culture platform for pharmacological screening and drug development studies.",

        "Abstract": "Viral vectors remain the most efficient and popular in deriving induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). For translation, it is important to silence or remove the reprogramming factors after induction of pluripotency. In this study, we design an excisable loxP-flanked lentiviral construct that a) includes all the reprogramming elements in a single lentiviral vector expressed by a strong EF-1\u03b1 promoter; b) enables easy determination of lentiviral titer; c) enables transgene removal and cell enrichment using LoxP-site-specific Cre-recombinase excision and Herpes Simplex Virus-thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-tk/gan) negative selection; and d) allows for transgene excision in a colony format. A reprogramming efficiency comparable to that reported in the literature without boosting molecules can be consistently obtained. To further demonstrate the utility of this Cre-loxP/HSV-tk/gan strategy, we incorporate a non-viral therapeutic transgene (human blood coagulation Factor IX) in the iPSCs, whose expression can be controlled by a temporal pulse of Cre recombinase. The robustness of this platform enables the implementation of an efficacious and cost-effective protocol for iPSC generation and their subsequent transgenesis for downstream studies.",

        "Abstract": "Transient overexpression of defined combinations of master regulator genes can effectively induce cellular reprogramming: the acquisition of an alternative predicted phenotype from a differentiated cell lineage. This can be of particular importance in cardiac regenerative medicine wherein the heart lacks the capacity to heal itself, but simultaneously contains a large pool of fibroblasts. In this study we determined the cardio-inducing capacity of ten transcription factors to actuate cellular reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells. Overexpression of transcription factors MYOCD and SRF alone or in conjunction with Mesp1 and SMARCD3 enhanced the basal but necessary cardio-inducing effect of the previously reported GATA4, TBX5, and MEF2C. In particular, combinations of five or seven transcription factors enhanced the activation of cardiac reporter vectors, and induced an upregulation of cardiac-specific genes. Global gene expression analysis also demonstrated a significantly greater cardio-inducing effect when the transcription factors MYOCD and SRF were used. Detection of cross-striated cells was highly dependent on the cell culture conditions and was enhanced by the addition of valproic acid and JAK inhibitor. Although we detected Ca(2+) transient oscillations in the reprogrammed cells, we did not detect significant changes in resting membrane potential or spontaneously contracting cells. This study further elucidates the cardio-inducing effect of the transcriptional networks involved in cardiac cellular reprogramming, contributing to the ongoing rational design of a robust protocol required for cardiac regenerative therapies.",

        "Abstract": "High throughput cellular studies require small sample volume to reduce costs and enhance sensitivity. Microfluidics-generated water-in-oil (W/O) single emulsion droplet systems, in particular, provide uniform, well defined and discrete microenvironment for cell culture, screening, and sorting. However, these single emulsion droplets are incapable of continuous supply of nutrient molecule and are not compatible with aqueous phase-based analysis. A solution is to entrap W/O droplets in another aqueous phase, forming water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) double emulsions. The external aqueous phase efficiently prevents desiccation and reduces the amount of organic component, and yet retaining the advantages of compartmentalization. The internal environment can also be programmed dynamically without the need of rupturing the droplets. In this study, we explore the potential application of W/O/W double emulsion droplets for cell cultivation, genetic activation and study of more complicated biological events such as bacteria quorum-sensing as an example. This study demonstrates the advantages and potential application of double emulsion for the study of complex biological processes.",

        "Abstract": "Oral delivery is an attractive route to deliver therapeutics via nanoparticles due to its ease of administration and patient compliance. This review discusses laboratory techniques for studying oral delivery of nanoparticles, which offer protection of cargo through the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the difficulties in modeling oral delivery include the harsh acidic environment, variable pH, and the tight monolayer of endothelial cells present throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The use of in vitro techniques including the Transwell \u00ae system, simulated gastric/intestinal fluid, and diffusion chambers addresses these challenges. When studying effects after oral delivery in vivo, bioimaging of nanoparticle biodistribution using radioactive markers has been popular. Functional assays such as immune response and systemic protein concentration analysis can further define the merits of the oral delivery systems. As biologics become increasingly more important in chronic therapies, nanoparticle-mediated oral delivery will assume greater prominence, and more sophisticated in vitro and in vivo models will be required.",

        "Abstract": "Transdifferentiation, where differentiated cells are reprogrammed into another lineage without going through an intermediate proliferative stem cell-like stage, is the next frontier of regenerative medicine. Wernig et al. first described the direct conversion of fibroblasts into functional induced neuronal cells (iNs). Subsequent reports of transdifferentiation into clinically relevant neuronal subtypes have further endorsed the prospect of autologous cell therapy for neurodegenerative disorders. So far, all published neuronal transdifferentiation protocols rely on lentiviruses, which likely precludes their clinical translation. Instead, we delivered plasmids encoding neuronal transcription factors (Brn2, Ascl1, Myt1l) to primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts with a bioreducible linear poly(amido amine). The low toxicity and high transfection efficiency of this gene carrier allowed repeated dosing to sustain high transgene expression levels. Serial 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g cm(-2) doses of reprogramming factors delivered at 48-hour intervals produced up to 7.6% Tuj1(+) (neuron-specific class III \u03b2-tubulin) cells, a subset of which expressed MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2), tau, and synaptophysin. A synapsin-red fluorescent protein (RFP) reporter helped to identify more mature, electrophysiologically active cells, with 24/26 patch-clamped RFP(+) cells firing action potentials. Some non-virally induced neuronal cells (NiNs) were observed firing multiple and spontaneous action potentials. This study demonstrates the feasibility of nonviral neuronal transdifferentiation, and may be amenable to other transdifferentiation processes.",

        "Abstract": "Transfection efficiencies and transgene expression kinetics of messenger RNA (mRNA), an emerging class of nucleic acid-based therapeutics, have been poorly characterized. In this study, we evaluated transfection efficiencies of mRNA delivered in naked and nanoparticle format in vitro and in vivo using GFP and luciferase as reporters. While mRNA nanoparticles transfect primary human and mouse dendritic cells (DCs) efficiently in vitro, naked mRNA could not produce any detectable gene product. The protein expression of nanoparticle-mediated transfection in vitro peaks rapidly within 5-7h and decays in a biphasic manner. In vivo, naked mRNA is more efficient than mRNA nanoparticles when administered subcutaneously. In contrast, mRNA nanoparticle performs better when administered intranasally and intravenously. Gene expression is most transient when delivered intravenously in nanoparticle format with an apparent half-life of 1.4h and lasts less than 24h, and most sustained when delivered in the naked format subcutaneously at the base of tail with an apparent half-life of 18h and persists for at least 6days. Notably, exponential decreases in protein expression are consistently observed post-delivery of mRNA in vivo regardless of the mode of delivery (naked or nanoparticle) or the site of administration.

        "Abstract": "Coculture of endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in vitro can yield confluent monolayers or EC networks. Factors influencing this transition are not known. In this study, we examined whether the spatial arrangement of EC-SMC cocultures affected EC migration, network morphology, and angiogenic protein secretion. Human umbilical cord blood-derived ECs (hCB-ECs) were grown in coculture with human aortic SMCs in either a mixed or lamellar spatial geometry and analyzed over a culture period of 12 days. The hCB-ECs cultured on SMCs in a mixed system had higher cell speeds, shorter persistence times, and lower random motility coefficients than ECs in a lamellar system. By day 12 of coculture, mixed systems demonstrated greater anastomoses and capillary loop formation than lamellar systems as evidenced by a higher number of branch points, angle of curvature between branch points, and percentage of imaged area covered by networks. The network morphology was more uniform in the mixed systems than the lamellar systems with fewer EC clusters present after several days in culture. Proliferation of hCB-ECs was higher for mixed cocultures during the first 24\u2009h of coculture, and then declined dramatically suggesting that proliferation only contributed to network formation during the early stages of coculture. Proteome assay results show reduced solution levels, but no change in intracellular levels of angiogenic proteins in lamellar systems compared to mixed systems. These data suggest that mixing ECs and SMCs together favors the formation of EC networks to a greater extent than a lamellar arrangement in which ECs form a cell layer above a confluent, quiescent layer of SMCs.",

        "Abstract": "Oral tolerance is defined as the specific suppression of humoral and/or cellular immune responses to an antigen by administration of the same antigen through the oral route. Due to its absence of toxicity, easy administration, and antigen specificity, oral tolerance is a very attractive approach to prevent unwanted immune responses that cause a variety of diseases or that complicate treatment of a disease. Many researchers have induced oral tolerance to efficiently treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in different animal models. However, clinical trials yielded limited success. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of oral tolerance induction to therapeutic proteins is critical for paving the way for clinical development of oral tolerance protocols. This review will summarize progress on understanding the major underlying tolerance mechanisms and contributors, including antigen presenting cells, regulatory T cells, cytokines, and signaling pathways. Potential applications, examples for therapeutic proteins and disease targets, and recent developments in delivery methods are discussed.",

        "Title": "Droplet microfluidics platform for highly sensitive and quantitative detection of malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites based on enzyme activity measurement.",
        "Abstract": "We present an attractive new system for the specific and sensitive detection of the malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites. The system relies on isothermal conversion of single DNA cleavage-ligation events catalyzed specifically by the Plasmodium enzyme topoisomerase I to micrometer-sized products detectable at the single-molecule level. Combined with a droplet microfluidics lab-on-a-chip platform, this design allowed for sensitive, specific, and quantitative detection of all human-malaria-causing Plasmodium species in single drops of unprocessed blood with a detection limit of less than one parasite/\u03bcL. Moreover, the setup allowed for detection of Plasmodium parasites in noninvasive saliva samples from infected patients. During recent years malaria transmission has declined worldwide, and with this the number of patients with low-parasite density has increased. Consequently, the need for accurate detection of even a few parasites is becoming increasingly important for the continued combat against the disease. We believe that the presented droplet microfluidics platform, which has a high potential for adaptation to point-of-care setups suitable for low-resource settings, may contribute significantly to meet this demand. Moreover, potential future adaptation of the presented setup for the detection of other microorganisms may form the basis for the development of a more generic platform for diagnosis, fresh water or food quality control, or other purposes within applied or basic science.",

        "Abstract": "The development of regenerative therapies for cartilage injury has been greatly aided by recent advances in stem cell biology. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have the potential to provide an abundant cell source for tissue engineering, as well as generating patient-matched in vitro models to study genetic and environmental factors in cartilage repair and osteoarthritis. However, both cell therapy and modeling approaches require a purified and uniformly differentiated cell population to predictably recapitulate the physiological characteristics of cartilage. Here, iPSCs derived from adult mouse fibroblasts were chondrogenically differentiated and purified by type II collagen (Col2)-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. Col2 and aggrecan gene expression levels were significantly up-regulated in GFP+ cells compared with GFP- cells and decreased with monolayer expansion. An in vitro cartilage defect model was used to demonstrate integrative repair by GFP+ cells seeded in agarose, supporting their potential use in cartilage therapies. In chondrogenic pellet culture, cells synthesized cartilage-specific matrix as indicated by high levels of glycosaminoglycans and type II collagen and low levels of type I and type X collagen. The feasibility of cell expansion after initial differentiation was illustrated by homogenous matrix deposition in pellets from twice-passaged GFP+ cells. Finally, atomic force microscopy analysis showed increased microscale elastic moduli associated with collagen alignment at the periphery of pellets, mimicking zonal variation in native cartilage. This study demonstrates the potential use of iPSCs for cartilage defect repair and for creating tissue models of cartilage that can be matched to specific genetic backgrounds.",

        "Abstract": "Nanoengineering exploits the interactions of materials at the nanometre scale to create functional nanostructures. It relies on the precise organization of nanomaterials to achieve unique functionality. There are no interactions more elegant than those governing nucleic acids via Watson-Crick base-pairing rules. The infinite combinations of DNA/RNA base pairs and their remarkable molecular recognition capability can give rise to interesting nanostructures that are only limited by our imagination. Over the past years, creative assembly of nucleic acids has fashioned a plethora of two-dimensional and three-dimensional nanostructures with precisely controlled size, shape and spatial functionalization. These nanostructures have been precisely patterned with molecules, proteins and gold nanoparticles for the observation of chemical reactions at the single molecule level, activation of enzymatic cascade and novel modality of photonic detection, respectively. Recently, they have also been engineered to encapsulate and release bioactive agents in a stimulus-responsive manner for therapeutic applications. The future of nucleic acid-based nanoengineering is bright and exciting. In this review, we will discuss the strategies to control the assembly of nucleic acids and highlight the recent efforts to build functional nucleic acid nanodevices for nanomedicine.",

        "Abstract": "Polymeric substrates intended for cell culture and tissue engineering are often surface-modified to facilitate cell attachment of most anchorage-dependent cell types. The modification alters the surface chemistry and possibly topography. However, scant attention has been paid to other surface property alterations. In studying oxygen plasma treatment of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), we show that oxygen plasma treatment alters the surface chemistry and, consequently, the topography and elasticity of PDMS at the nanoscale level. The elasticity factor has the predominant effect, compared with the chemical and topographical factors, on cell adhesions of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The enhanced focal adhesions favor cell spreading and osteogenesis of hMSCs. Given the prevalent use of PDMS in biomedical device construction and cell culture experiments, this study highlights the importance of understanding how oxygen plasma treatment would impact subsequent cell-substrate interactions. It helps explain inconsistency in the literature and guides preparation of PDMS-based biomedical devices in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Development of effective, yet safe, antithrombotic agents has been challenging because such agents increase the propensity of patients to bleed. Recently, naturally occurring polyphosphates such as extracellular DNA, RNA, and inorganic polyphosphates have been shown to activate blood coagulation. In this report, we evaluate the anticoagulant and antithrombotic activity of nucleic acid-binding polymers in vitro and in vivo. Such polymers bind to DNA, RNA, and inorganic polyphosphate molecules with high affinity and inhibit RNA- and polyphosphate-induced clotting and the activation of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation in vitro. Moreover, [NH(2)(CH(2))(2)NH(2)](G = 3);dendri PAMAM(NH(2))(32) (PAMAM G-3) prevents thrombosis following carotid artery injury and pulmonary thromboembolism in mice without significantly increasing blood loss from surgically challenged animals. These studies indicate that nucleic acid-binding polymers are able to scavenge effectively prothrombotic nucleic acids and other polyphosphates in vivo and represent a new and potentially safer class of antithrombotic agents.",

        "Abstract": "Antibodies to DNA (anti-DNA) are the serological hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and can mediate disease pathogenesis by the formation of immune complexes. Since blocking immune complex formation can attenuate disease manifestations, the effects of nucleic acid binding polymers (NABPs) on anti-DNA binding in vitro were investigated. The compounds tested included polyamidoamine dendrimer, 1,4-diaminobutane core, generation 3.0 (PAMAM-G3), hexadimethrine bromide, and a \u03b2-cylodextrin-containing polycation. As shown with plasma from patients with SLE, NABPs can inhibit anti-DNA antibody binding in ELISA assays. The inhibition was specific since the NABPs did not affect binding to tetanus toxoid or the Sm protein, another lupus autoantigen. Furthermore, the polymers could displace antibody from preformed complexes. Together, these results indicate that NABPs can inhibit the formation of immune complexes and may represent a new approach to treatment.",

They hold promise for treating a plethora of diseases ranging from musculoskeletal defects to myocardial infarction and to neural disorders. Understanding how to control the fate decision of these cells to self-renew or differentiate is paramount in stem cell tissue engineering. Recently, significant progress has been made in guiding stem cell differentiation in\u00a0vitro, and we are beginning to understand the complex interplay of factors that control their fate. Here, we highlight the recent approaches for guidance of stem cells through patterning of surfaces at the micro- and nanoscale. Particular attention is given to chemical patterning of substrates with adhesion ligands and physical patterning with a variety of topographical features. These surface-mediated biochemical and mechanical cues have proven influential in altering a wide range of stem cell phenotypes. This approach to guide or ultimately control stem cells by surface patterning has enormous potential implications in cell therapies and regenerative medicine.",

However, to achieve many of these applications, high-throughput, low-cost techniques are needed to synthesize these particles with precise control of the various structural/physical/chemical properties. Microfluidics provides a unique platform to fabricate Janus particles using carefully controlled liquid flow in microfluidic channels to form Janus droplets and various types of solidification methods to solidify them into Janus particles. In this Focus article, we summarize the most recent representative works on Janus particle fabrication in microfluidics. The applications of Janus particles in biomedical areas are emphasized. We believe that microfluidics-enabled multifunctional Janus particles could resolve multiple prevalent issues in biomedicine (e.g., disease monitoring at an early stage, high-throughput bioassays, therapeutic delivery) if persistent effort and collaboration are devoted to this direction.",

Here we study the culture of hMSC on polydimethylsiloxane substrates with 350 nm grating topography and investigate the focal adhesion composition and dynamics using biochemical and imaging techniques. Our results show that zyxin protein plays a key role in the hMSC response to nanotopography. Zyxin expression is downregulated on 350 nm gratings, leading to smaller and more dynamic focal adhesion. Since the association of zyxin with focal adhesions is force-dependent, smaller zyxin-positive adhesion as well as its higher turnover rate suggests that the traction force in focal adhesion on 350 nm topography is decreased. These changes lead to faster and more directional migration on 350 nm gratings. These findings demonstrate that nanotopography decreases the mechanical forces acting on focal adhesions in hMSC and suggest that force-dependent changes in zyxin protein expression and kinetics underlie the focal adhesion remodeling in response to 350 nm grating topography, resulting in modulation of hMSC function.",

Separation of the nucleic acid from the carrier is one of the barriers, which may be analyzed by F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), a mechanism used to detect interactions between fluorescently labeled molecules. When applied to the molecular components of polymer or lipid-based nanocomplexes, FRET provides information on their complexation status, uptake, release and degradation. Recently, the design of FRET systems incorporating quantum dots as energy donors has led to improved signal stability, allowing prolonged measurements, as well as increased sensitivity, enabling direct detection and the potential for multiplexing. The union of quantum dots and FRET is providing new insights into the mechanisms of nonviral nucleic acid delivery through convergent characterization of delivery barriers, and has the potential to accelerate the design of improved carriers to realize the potential of nucleic acid therapeutics and gene medicine.",

        "Title": "Comparative study of nanoparticle-mediated transfection in different GI epithelium co-culture models.",
        "Abstract": "Oral nonviral gene delivery is the most attractive and arguably the most challenging route of administration. To identify a suitable carrier, we studied the transport of different classes (natural polymer, synthetic polymer and synthetic lipid-polymer) of DNA nanoparticles through three well-characterized cellular models of intestinal epithelium (Caco2, Caco2-HT29MTX and Caco2-Raji). Poly(phosphoramidate-dipropylamine) (PPA) and Lipid-Protamine-DNA (LPD) nanoparticles consistently showed the highest level of human insulin mRNA expression and luciferase protein expression in these models, typically at least three orders of magnitude above background. All of the nanoparticles increased tight junction permeability, with PPA and PEI having the most dramatic transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) decreases of (35.3\u00b18.5%) and (37.5\u00b11.5%) respectively in the first hour. The magnitude of TEER decrease correlated with nanoparticle surface charge, implicating electrostatic interactions with the tight junction proteins. However, confocal microscopy revealed that the nanoparticles were mostly uptaken by the enterocytes. Quantitative uptake and transport experiments showed that the endocytosed, quantum dot (QD)-labeled PPA-DNA nanoparticles remained in the intestinal cells even after 24h. Negligible amount of quantum dot labeled DNA was detected in the basolateral chamber, with the exception of the Caco2-Raji co-cultures, which internalized nanoparticles 2 to 3 times more readily compared to Caco2 and Caco2-HT29MTX cultures. PEGylation decreased the transfection efficacy by at least an order of magnitude, lowered the magnitude of TEER decrease and halved the uptake of PPA-DNA nanoparticles. A key finding was insulin mRNA being detected in the underlying HepG2 cells, signifying that some of the plasmid was transported across the intestinal epithelial layer while retaining at least partial bioactivity. However, the inefficient transport suggests that transcytosis alone would not engender a significant therapeutic effect, and this transport modality must be augmented by other means in vivo to render nonviral oral gene delivery practical.",

Here we show that submicrometre particles modelled after MC granules augment immunity when used as adjuvants in vaccines. The synthetic particles, which consist of a carbohydrate backbone with encapsulated inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor, replicate attributes of MCs in vivo including the targeting of draining lymph nodes and the timed release of the encapsulated mediators. When used as an adjuvant during vaccination of mice with haemagglutinin from the influenza virus, the particles enhanced adaptive immune responses and increased survival of mice on lethal challenge. Furthermore, differential loading of the particles with the cytokine IL-12 directed the character of the response towards Th1 lymphocytes. The synthetic MC adjuvants replicate and enhance the functions of MCs during vaccination, and can be extended to polarize the resulting immunity.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in pluripotent stem cell research have provided investigators with potent sources of cardiogenic cells. However, tissue engineering methodologies to assemble cardiac progenitors into aligned, 3-dimensional (3D) myocardial tissues capable of physiologically relevant electrical conduction and force generation are lacking. In this study, we introduced 3D cell alignment cues in a fibrin-based hydrogel matrix to engineer highly functional cardiac tissues from genetically purified mouse embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) and cardiovascular progenitors (CVPs). Procedures for CM and CVP derivation, purification, and functional differentiation in monolayer cultures were first optimized to yield robust intercellular coupling and maximize velocity of action potential propagation. A versatile soft-lithography technique was then applied to reproducibly fabricate engineered cardiac tissues with controllable size and 3D architecture. While purified CMs assembled into a functional 3D syncytium only when supplemented with supporting non-myocytes, purified CVPs differentiated into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells, and autonomously supported the formation of functional cardiac tissues. After a total culture time similar to period of mouse embryonic development (21 days), the engineered cardiac tissues exhibited unprecedented levels of 3D organization and functional differentiation characteristic of native neonatal myocardium, including: 1) dense, uniformly aligned, highly differentiated and electromechanically coupled cardiomyocytes, 2) rapid action potential conduction with velocities between 22 and 25 cm/s, and 3) significant contractile forces of up to 2 mN. These results represent an important advancement in stem cell-based cardiac tissue engineering and provide the foundation for exploiting the exciting progress in pluripotent stem cell research in the future tissue engineering therapies for heart disease.",

        "Abstract": "Due to the ability to easily accept and donate electrons Mn(III)N-alkylpyridylporphyrins (MnPs) can dismute O(2)(\u00b7-), reduce peroxynitrite, but also generate reactive species and behave as pro-oxidants if conditions favour such action. Herein two ortho isomers, MnTE-2-PyP(5+), MnTnHex-2-PyP(5+), and a meta isomer MnTnHex-3-PyP(5+), which differ greatly with regard to their metal-centered reduction potential, E(1/2) (Mn(III)P/Mn(II)P) and lipophilicity, were explored. Employing Mn(III)P/Mn(II)P redox system for coupling with ascorbate, these MnPs catalyze ascorbate oxidation and thus peroxide production. Consequently, cancer oxidative burden may be enhanced, which in turn would suppress its growth. Cytotoxic effects on Caco-2, Hela, 4T1, HCT116 and SUM149 were studied. When combined with ascorbate, MnPs killed cancer cells via peroxide produced outside of the cell. MnTE-2-PyP(5+) was the most efficacious catalyst for peroxide production, while MnTnHex-3-PyP(5+) is most prone to oxidative degradation with H(2) , and thus the least efficacious. A 4T1 breast cancer mouse study of limited scope and success was conducted. The tumour oxidative stress was enhanced and its microvessel density reduced when mice were treated either with ascorbate or MnP/ascorbate; the trend towards tumour growth suppression was detected.",

        "Abstract": "As a prelude to the understanding of mechanotransduction in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation, the mechanical behavior of hESCs in the form of cell pellet is studied. The pellets were tested after 3 or 5 weeks of cell culture in order to demonstrate the effect of the duration of cell culture on the mechanical properties of the pellets. A micromechanical tester was used to conduct unconfined compression on hESC pellet, and experimental, numerical, and analytical methods were combined to determine the mechanical properties of hESC pellet. It is assumed that the mechanical behavior of hESC pellets can be described by an isotropic, linear viscoelastic model consisting of a spring and two Maxwell units in parallel, and the Poisson's ratio of the hESC pellet is constant based on pellet deformation in the direction perpendicular to the compression direction. Finite element method (FEM) simulation was adopted to determine the values of Poisson's ratio and the five parameters contained in the viscoelastic model. The variations of Poisson's ratio and the initial elastic modulus are found to be larger compared with those of the four other parameters. Results show that longer duration of cell culture leads to higher modulus of hESC pellet. The effect of pellet size error on the values of mechanical parameters determined is studied using FEM simulation, and it is found that the effect of size error on Poisson's ratio and initial elastic modulus is much larger than that on the other parameters.",

        "Abstract": "Dead and dying cells release nucleic acids. These extracellular RNAs and DNAs can be taken up by inflammatory cells and activate multiple nucleic acid-sensing toll-like receptors (TLR3, 7, 8, and 9). The inappropriate activation of these TLRs can engender a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The redundancy of the TLR family encouraged us to seek materials that can neutralize the proinflammatory effects of any nucleic acid regardless of its sequence, structure or chemistry. Herein we demonstrate that certain nucleic acid-binding polymers can inhibit activation of all nucleic acid-sensing TLRs irrespective of whether they recognize ssRNA, dsRNA or hypomethylated DNA. Furthermore, systemic administration of such polymers can prevent fatal liver injury engendered by proinflammatory nucleic acids in an acute toxic shock model in mice. Therefore these polymers represent a novel class of anti-inflammatory agent that can act as molecular scavengers to neutralize the proinflammatory effects of various nucleic acids.",

        "Abstract": "Lipoplexes and polyplexes represent the two major nanocarrier systems for nucleic acid delivery. Previous studies examining their uptake and intracellular unpacking rely on organic fluorophores fraught with low signal intensity and photobleaching. In this work quantum dot mediated F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (QD-FRET) was first used to study and compare the cellular uptake and the intracellular fate of oligodeoxynucelotide (ODN)-based lipoplexes and polyplexes. QD605-amine and Cy5-labeled ODN (Cy5-GTI2040) were chosen as the FRET pair. By adjusting the lipid/ODN ratio of lipoplexes and the nitrogen/phosphate (N/P) ratio of polyplexes, lipoplexes and polyplexes with comparable physical properties were produced. The biological activities of dual-labeled lipoplexes and polyplexes remained unaltered compared to their unlabeled counterparts as evidenced by their comparable antisense activities against protein R2 in KB cells. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy revealed similar pattern of uptake for these two types of nanoparticles, although polyplexes had a higher dissociation rate than lipoplexes in KB cells. We demonstrate that QD-FRET is a sensitive tool to study the uptake and intracellular unpacking of lipoplexes and polyplexes, which may help optimize their formulations for various theranostics applications.",

        "Abstract": "We hypothesised that global structural changes in stem cells would manifest with differentiation, and that these changes would be observable with light scattering microscopy. Analysed with a fractal dimension formalism, we observed significant structural changes in differentiating human mesenchymal stem cells within one day after induction, earlier than could be detected by gene expression profiling. Moreover, light scattering microscopy is entirely non-perturbative, so the same sample could be monitored throughout the differentiation process. We explored one possible mechanism, chromatin remodelling, to account for the changes we observed. Correlating with the staining of HP1\u03b1, a heterochromatin protein, we applied novel microscopy methods and fractal analysis to monitor the plastic dynamics of chromatin within stem cell nuclei. We showed that the level of chromatin condensation changed during differentiation, and provide one possible explanation for the changes seen with the light scattering method. These results lend physical insight into stem cell differentiation while providing physics-based methods for non-invasive detection of the differentiation process.",

        "Title": "Diverse functions of cationic Mn(III) N-substituted pyridylporphyrins, recognized as SOD mimics.",
        "Abstract": "Oxidative stress, a redox imbalance between the endogenous reactive species and antioxidant systems, is common to numerous pathological conditions such as cancer, central nervous system injuries, radiation injury, diabetes etc. Therefore, compounds able to reduce oxidative stress have been actively sought for over 3 decades. Superoxide is the major species involved in oxidative stress either in its own right or through its progeny, such as ONOO\u207b, H\u2082O\u2082, \u2022OH, CO\u2083\u2022\u207b, and \u2022NO\u2082. Hence, the very first compounds developed in the late 1970-ies were the superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimics. Thus far the most potent mimics have been the cationic meso Mn(III) N-substituted pyridylporphyrins and N,N'-disubstituted imidazolylporphyrins (MnPs), some of them with k(cat)(O\u2082\u00b7\u207b) similar to the k(cat) of SOD enzymes. Most frequently studied are ortho isomers MnTE-2-PyP\u2075\u207a, MnTnHex-2-PyP\u2075\u207a, and MnTDE-2-ImP\u2075\u207a. The ability to disproportionate O\u2082\u00b7\u207b parallels their ability to remove the other major oxidizing species, peroxynitrite, ONOO\u207b. The same structural feature that gives rise to the high k(cat)(O\u2082\u00b7\u207b) and k(red)(ONOO\u207b), allows MnPs to strongly impact the activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factors, HIF-1\u03b1, NF-\u03baB, AP-1, and SP-1, and therefore modify the excessive inflammatory and immune responses. Coupling with cellular reductants and other redox-active endogenous proteins seems to be involved in the actions of Mn porphyrins. While hydrophilic analogues, such as MnTE-2-PyP\u2075\u207a and MnTDE-2-ImP\u2075\u207a are potent in numerous animal models of diseases, the lipophilic analogues, such as MnTnHex-2-PyP\u2075\u207a, were developed to cross blood brain barrier and target central nervous system and critical cellular compartments, mitochondria. The modification of its structure, aimed to preserve the SOD-like potency and lipophilicity, and diminish the toxicity, has presently been pursued. The pulmonary radioprotection by MnTnHex-2-PyP\u2075\u207a was the first efficacy study performed successfully with non-human primates. The Phase I toxicity clinical trials were done on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with N,N'-diethylimidazolium analogue, MnTDE-2-ImP\u2075\u207a (AEOL10150). Its aggressive development as a wide spectrum radioprotector by Aeolus Pharmaceuticals has been supported by USA Federal government. The latest generation of compounds, bearing oxygens in pyridyl substituents is presently under aggressive development for cancer and CNS injuries at Duke University and is supported by Duke Translational Research Institute, The Wallace H. Coulter Translational Partners Grant Program, Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke, and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Metal center of cationic MnPs easily accepts and donates electrons as exemplified in the catalysis of O\u2082\u00b7\u207b dismutation. Thus such compounds may be equally good anti- and pro-oxidants; in either case the beneficial therapeutic effects may be observed. Moreover, while the in vivo effects may appear antioxidative, the mechanism of action of MnPs that produced such effects may be pro-oxidative; the most obvious example being the inhibition of NF-\u03baB. The experimental data therefore teach us that we need to distinguish between the mechanism/s of action/s of MnPs and the effects we observe. A number of factors impact the type of action of MnPs leading to favorable therapeutic effects: levels of reactive species and oxygen, levels of endogenous antioxidants (enzymes and low-molecular compounds), levels of MnPs, their site of accumulation, and the mutual encounters of all of those species. The complexity of in vivo redox systems and the complex redox chemistry of MnPs challenge and motivate us to further our understanding of the physiology of the normal and diseased cell with ultimate goal to successfully treat human diseases.",

        "Abstract": "The future of genetic medicine hinges on successful intracellular delivery of nucleic acid-based therapeutics. While significant effort has concentrated on developing nanocarriers to improve the delivery aspects, scant attention has been paid to the synthetic process of poorly controlled nanocomplex formation. Proposed here is a reliable system to better control the complexation process, and thus the physical properties of the nanocomplexes, through microfluidics-assisted confinement (MAC) in picoliter droplets. We show that these homogeneous MAC-synthesized nanocomplexes exhibit narrower size distribution, lower cytotoxicity, and higher transfection efficiency compared to their bulk-synthesized counterparts. MAC represents a physical approach to control the energetic self-assembly of polyelectrolytes, thereby complementing the chemical innovations in nanocarrier design to optimize nucleic acid and peptide delivery.",

        "Abstract": "Cells residing in a microenvironment interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and neighboring cells. The ECM built from biomacromolecules often includes nanotopography. Through the ECM, interstitial flows facilitate transport of nutrients and play an important role in tissue maintenance and pathobiology. To create a microenvironment that can incorporate both nanotopography and flow for studies of cell-matrix interactions, we fabricated microfluidic channels endowed with nanopatterns suitable for dynamic culture. Using polymer thin film technology, we developed a versatile stitching technique to generate a large area of nanopatterned surface and a simple microtransfer assembly technique to assemble polydimethylsiloxane-based microfluidics. The cellular study showed that both nanotopography and fluid shear stress played a significant role in adhesion, spreading, and migration of human mesenchymal stem cells. The orientation and deformation of cytoskeleton and nuclei were regulated through the interplay of these two cues. The nanostructured microfluidic platform provides a useful tool to promote the fundamental understanding of cell-matrix interactions and may be used to regulate the fate of stem cells.",

        "Abstract": "Significant effort continues to be exerted toward the improvement of transfection mediated by nonviral vectors. These endeavors are often focused on the design of particulate carriers with properties that encourage efficient accumulation at the membrane surface, particle uptake, and endosomal escape. Despite its demonstrated importance in successful nonviral transfection, relatively little investigation has been done to understand the pressures driving internalized vectors into favorable nondegradative endocytic pathways. Improvements in transfection efficiency have been noted for complexes delivered with a substrate-mediated approach, but the reasons behind such enhancements remain unclear. The phenotypic changes exhibited by cells interacting with nano- and micro-featured substrates offer hints that may explain these effects. This review describes nanoscale particulate and substrate parameters that influence both the uptake of nonviral gene carriers and the endocytic phenotype of interacting cells, and explores the molecular links that may mediate these interactions. Substrate-mediated control of endocytosis represents an exciting new design parameter that will guide the creation of efficient transgene carriers.",

Topographical control of cell transfectability, however, remains a largely unexplored parameter. Emerging literature has highlighted the influence of cell-topography interactions on modulation of many cell phenotypes, including protein expression and cytoskeletal behaviors implicated in endocytosis. Using high-throughput screening of primary human dermal fibroblasts cultured on a combinatorial library of microscale topographies, we have demonstrated an improvement in nonviral transfection efficiency for cells cultured on dense micropit patterns compared to smooth substrates, as verified with flow cytometry. A 25% increase in GFP(+) cells was observed independent of proliferation rate, accompanied by SEM and confocal microscopy characterization to help explain the phenomenon qualitatively. This finding encourages researchers to investigate substrate topography as a new design consideration for the optimization of nonviral transfection systems.",

        "Abstract": "Cells sense cues in their surrounding microenvironment. These cues are converted into intracellular signals and transduced to the nucleus in order for the cell to respond and adapt its function. Within the nucleus, structural changes occur that ultimately lead to changes in the gene expression. In this study, we explore the structural changes of the nucleus of human mesenchymal stem cells as an effect of topographical cues. We use a controlled nanotopography to drive shape changes to the cell nucleus, and measure the changes with both fluorescence microscopy and a novel light scattering technique. The nucleus changes shape dramatically in response to the nanotopography, and in a manner dependent on the mechanical properties of the substrate. The kinetics of the nuclear deformation follows an unexpected trajectory. As opposed to a gradual shape change in response to the topography, once the cytoskeleton attains an aligned and elongation morphology on the time scale of several hours, the nucleus changes shape rapidly and intensely.",

        "Title": "Simultaneous delivery of siRNA and paclitaxel via a \"two-in-one\" micelleplex promotes synergistic tumor suppression.",
        "Abstract": "Combination of two or more therapeutic strategies with different mechanisms can cooperatively prohibit cancer development. Combination of chemotherapy and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based therapy represents an example of this approach. Hypothesizing that the chemotherapeutic drug and the siRNA should be simultaneously delivered to the same tumoral cell to exert their synergistic effect, the development of delivery systems that can efficiently encapsulate two drugs and successfully deliver payloads to targeted sites via systemic administration has proven to be challenging. Here, we demonstrate an innovative \"two-in-one\" micelleplex approach based on micellar nanoparticles of a biodegradable triblock copolymer poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(\u03b5-caprolactone)-b-poly(2-aminoethyl ethylene phosphate) to systemically deliver the siRNA and chemotherapeutic drug. We show clear evidence that the micelleplex is capable of delivering siRNA and paclitaxel simultaneously to the same tumoral cells both in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrate that systemic administration of the micelleplex carrying polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) specific siRNA and paclitaxel can induce a synergistic tumor suppression effect in the MDA-MB-435s xenograft murine model, requiring a thousand-fold less paclitaxel than needed for paclitaxel monotherapy delivered by the micelleplex and without activation of the innate immune response or generation of carrier-associated toxicity.",

        "Abstract": "In this report, we have demonstrated that by temporarily removing Kupffer cells (KCs), the transgene expression levels mediated by retrograde intrabiliary infusion (RII) of plasmid DNA, polyethylenimine-DNA, and chitosan nanoparticles were enhanced by 1,927-, 131-, and 23,450-fold, respectively, in comparison with the respective groups without KC removal. KC removal also led to significantly prolonged transgene expression in the liver that received all three carriers. This increased transgene expression was correlated with significantly reduced serum tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 level as an indicator for KC activation. These results suggest that KC activation is a significant contributing factor to the lowered transgene expression by polycation-DNA nanoparticles delivered by RII. More importantly, the combination of RII and transient removal of KCs may be adopted as an effective approach to achieving high and persistent transgene expression in the liver mediated by nonviral nanoparticles.",

In this study, we demonstrate the sustained treatment of hemophilia through a non-viral, tissue engineering approach facilitated by growth factor-releasing co-axial electrospun fibers. FVIII-producing skeletal myotubes were first engineered on aligned electrospun fibers in vitro, followed by implantation in hemophilic mice with or without a layer of core-shell electrospun fibers designed to provide sustained delivery of angiogenic or lymphangiogenic growth factors, which serves to stimulate the lymphatic or vascular systems to enhance the FVIII transport from the implant site into systemic circulation. Upon subcutaneous implantation into hemophilic mice, the construct seamlessly integrated with the host tissue within one month, and specifically induced either vascular or lymphatic network infiltration in accordance with the growth factors released from the electrospun fibers. Engineered constructs that induced angiogenesis resulted in sustained elevation of plasma FVIII and significantly reduced blood coagulation time for at least 2-months. Biomaterials-assisted functional tissue engineering was shown in this study to offer protein replacement therapy for a genetic disorder such as hemophilia.",

        "Abstract": "In the cell Mn porphyrins (MnPs) likely couple with cellular reductants which results in a drop of total charge from 5+ to 4+ and dramatically increases their lipophilicity by up to three orders of magnitude depending upon the length of alkylpyridyl chains and type of isomer. The effects result from the interplay of solvation, lipophilicit and stericity. Impact of ascorbate on accumulation of MnPs was measured in E. coli and in Balb/C mouse tumours and muscle; for the latter measurements, the LC/ESI-MS/MS method was developed. Accumulation was significantly enhanced when MnPs were co-administered with ascorbate in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Further, MnTnHex-2-PyP(5+) accumulates 5-fold more in the tumour than in a muscle. Such data increase our understanding of MnPs cellular and sub-cellular accumulation and remarkable in vivo effects. The work is in progress to understand how coupling of MnPs with ascorbate affects their mechanism of action, in particular with respect to cancer therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Cells in most tissues reside in microenvironment surrounded with specific three-dimensional features. The extracellular matrix or substratum with which cells interact often includes topography at the nanoscale. For example, the basement membrane of many tissues displays features of pores, fibers and ridges in the nanometer range. The nanoscale topography has significant effects on cellular behavior. Knowledge of the cell-substratum interactions is crucial to the understanding of many fundamental biological questions and to regenerative medicine. Rapid advances in nanotechnology enable cellular study on engineered nanoscale surfaces. Recent findings underscore the phenomenon that mammalian cells do respond to nanosized features on a synthetic surface. This review covers the commonly used techniques of engineering nanoscale surface and the techniques which have not been adapted but are of great potential in regenerative medicine, surveys the applications of nanoscale surface in regenerative medicine including vascular, bone, neural and stem cell tissue engineering, and discusses the possible mechanisms of cellular responses to nanoscale surface. A better understanding of the interactions between cells and nanoscale surfacing will help advance the field of regenerative medicine.",

Much of the initial progress for QDs in biology and medicine has focused on developing new biosensing formats to push the limit of detection sensitivity. Nevertheless, QDs can be more than passive bio-probes or labels for biological imaging and cellular studies. The high surface-to-volume ratio of QDs enables the construction of a \"smart\" multifunctional nanoplatform, where the QDs serve not only as an imaging agent but also a nanoscaffold catering for therapeutic and diagnostic (theranostic) modalities.

        "Abstract": "Stem cell transplantation holds great promise for the treatment of myocardial infarction injury. We recently described the embryonic stem cell-derived cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) capable of differentiating into cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelium, and smooth muscle. In this study, we hypothesized that transplanted CPCs will preserve function of the infarcted heart by participating in both muscle replacement and neovascularization. Differentiated CPCs formed functional electromechanical junctions with cardiomyocytes in vitro and conducted action potentials over cm-scale distances. When transplanted into infarcted mouse hearts, CPCs engrafted long-term in the infarct zone and surrounding myocardium without causing teratomas or arrhythmias. The grafted cells differentiated into cross-striated cardiomyocytes forming gap junctions with the host cells, while also contributing to neovascularization. Serial echocardiography and pressure-volume catheterization demonstrated attenuated ventricular dilatation and preserved left ventricular fractional shortening, systolic and diastolic function. Our results demonstrate that CPCs can engraft, differentiate, and preserve the functional output of the infarcted heart.",

        "Abstract": "A free-standing, robust cell sheet comprising aligned human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) offers many interesting opportunities for tissue reconstruction. As a first step toward this goal, a confluent, uniform hMSC layer with a high degree of alignment and stemness maintenance needs to be created. Hypothesizing that topographical cue and a physiologically relevant low-oxygen condition could promote the formation of such an hMSC layer, we studied the culture of hMSCs on synthetic nanogratings (350 nm width and 700 nm pitch) and either under 2 or 20% O(2). Culturing hMSCs on the nanogratings highly aligned the cells, but it tended to create patchy layers and accentuate the hMSC differentiation. The 2% O(2) improved the alignment and uniformity of hMSCs, and reduced their differentiation. Over a 14-day culture period, hMSCs in 2% O(2) showed uniform connexon distribution, secreted abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and displayed a high progenicity. After 21-day culture on nanogratings, hMSCs exposed to 2% O(2) maintained a higher viability and differentiation capacity. This study established that a 2% O(2) culture condition could restrict the differentiation of hMSCs cultured on nanopatterns, thereby setting the foundation to fabricate a uniformly aligned hMSC sheet for different regenerative medicine applications.",

        "Abstract": "Nanoscale vectors comprised of cationic polymers that condense DNA to form nanocomplexes are promising options for gene transfer. The rational design of more efficient nonviral gene carriers will be possible only with better mechanistic understanding of the critical rate-limiting steps, such as nanocomplex unpacking to release DNA and degradation by nucleases. We present a two-step quantum dot fluorescence resonance energy transfer (two-step QD-FRET) approach to simultaneously and non-invasively analyze DNA condensation and stability. Plasmid DNA, double-labeled with QD (525 nm emission) and nucleic acid dyes, were complexed with Cy5-labeled cationic gene carriers. The QD donor drives energy transfer stepwise through the intermediate nucleic acid dye to the final acceptor Cy5. At least three distinct states of DNA condensation and integrity were distinguished in single particle manner and within cells by quantitative ratiometric analysis of energy transfer efficiencies. This novel two-step QD-FRET method allows for more detailed assessment of the onset of DNA release and degradation simultaneously.",

        "Abstract": "Current strategies to limit macrophage adhesion, fusion and fibrous capsule formation in the foreign body response have focused on modulating material surface properties. We hypothesize that topography close to biological scale, in the micron and nanometric range, provides a passive approach without bioactive agents to modulate macrophage behavior. In our study, topography-induced changes in macrophage behavior was examined using parallel gratings (250 nm-2 mum line width) imprinted on poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS). RAW 264.7 cell adhesion and elongation occurred maximally on 500 nm gratings compared to planar controls over 48 h. TNF-alpha and VEGF secretion levels by RAW 264.7 cells showed greatest sensitivity to topographical effects, with reduced levels observed on larger grating sizes at 48 h. In vivo studies at 21 days showed reduced macrophage adhesion density and degree of high cell fusion on 2 mum gratings compared to planar controls. It was concluded that topography affects macrophage behavior in the foreign body response on all polymer surfaces examined. Topography-induced changes, independent of surface chemistry, did not reveal distinctive patterns but do affect cell morphology and cytokine secretion in vitro, and cell adhesion in vivo particularly on larger size topography compared to planar controls.",

        "Title": "Transport of chitosan-DNA nanoparticles in human intestinal M-cell model versus normal intestinal enterocytes.",
        "Abstract": "Oral vaccination is one of the most promising applications of polymeric nanoparticles. Using two different in vitro cellular models to partially reproduce the characteristics of intestinal enterocytes and M-cells, this study demonstrates that nanoparticle transport through the M-cell co-culture model is 5-fold that of the intestinal epithelial monolayer, with at least 80% of the chitosan-DNA nanoparticles uptaken in the first 30 min. Among the properties of nanoparticles studied, ligand decoration has the most dramatic effect on the transcytosis rate: transferrin modification enhances transport through both models by 3- to 5-fold. The stability of the nanoparticles also affects transport kinetics. Factors which de-stabilize the nanoparticles, such as low charge (N/P) ratio and addition of serum, result in aggregation and in turn decreases transport efficiency. Of these stability factors, luminal pH is of great interest as an increase in pH from 5.5 to 6.4 and 7.4 leads to a 3- and 10-fold drop in nanoparticle transport, respectively. Since soluble chitosan can act as an enhancer to increase paracellular transport by up to 60%, this decrease is partially attributed to the soluble chitosan precipitating near neutral pH. The implication that chitosan-DNA nanoparticles are more stable in the upper regions of the small intestine suggests that higher uptake rates may occur in the duodenum compared to the ileum and the colon.",

        "Abstract": "The growth of stem cells can be modulated by physical factors such as extracellular matrix nanotopography. We hypothesize that nanotopography modulates cell behavior by changing the integrin clustering and focal adhesion (FA) assembly, leading to changes in cytoskeletal organization and cell mechanical properties. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) cultured on 350 nm gratings of tissue-culture polystyrene (TCPS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) showed decreased expression of integrin subunits alpha2, alpha , alpha V, beta2, beta 3 and beta 4 compared to the unpatterned controls. On gratings, the elongated hMSCs exhibited an aligned actin cytoskeleton, while on unpatterned controls, spreading cells showed a random but denser actin cytoskeleton network. Expression of cytoskeleton and FA components was also altered by the nanotopography as reflected in the mechanical properties measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation. On the rigid TCPS, hMSCs on gratings exhibited lower instantaneous and equilibrium Young's moduli and apparent viscosity. On the softer PDMS, the effects of nanotopography were not significant. However, hMSCs cultured on PDMS showed lower cell mechanical properties than those on TCPS, regardless of topography. These suggest that both nanotopography and substrate stiffness could be important in determining mechanical properties, while nanotopography may be more dominant in determining the organization of the cytoskeleton and FAs.",

These complexes enter lymphatic vessels and rapidly traffic to the DLNs.

        "Abstract": "With an ever increasing number of people taking numerous medications, the need to safely administer drugs and limit unintended side effects has never been greater. Antidote control remains the most direct means to counteract acute side effects of drugs, but, unfortunately, it has been challenging and cost prohibitive to generate antidotes for most therapeutic agents. Here we describe the development of a set of antidote molecules that are capable of counteracting the effects of an entire class of therapeutic agents based upon aptamers. These universal antidotes exploit the fact that, when systemically administered, aptamers are the only free extracellular oligonucleotides found in circulation. We show that protein- and polymer-based molecules that capture oligonucleotides can reverse the activity of several aptamers in vitro and counteract aptamer activity in vivo. The availability of universal antidotes to control the activity of any aptamer suggests that aptamers may be a particularly safe class of therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Tissue engineering may provide an alternative to cell injection as a therapeutic solution for myocardial infarction. A tissue-engineered muscle patch may offer better host integration and higher functional performance. This study examined the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts on aligned electrospun polyurethane (PU) fibers and in the presence of electromechanical stimulation. Skeletal myoblasts cultured on aligned PU fibers showed more pronounced elongation, better alignment, higher level of transient receptor potential cation channel-1 (TRPC-1) expression, upregulation of contractile proteins and higher percentage of striated myotubes compared to those cultured on random PU fibers and film. The resulting tissue constructs generated tetanus forces of 1.1 mN with a 10-ms time to tetanus. Additional mechanical, electrical, or synchronized electromechanical stimuli applied to myoblasts cultured on PU fibers increased the percentage of striated myotubes from 70 to 85% under optimal stimulation conditions, which was accompanied by an upregulation of contractile proteins such as \u03b1-actinin and myosin heavy chain. In describing how electromechanical cues can be combined with topographical cue, this study helped move towards the goal of generating a biomimetic microenvironment for engineering of functional skeletal muscle.",

        "Abstract": "Engineering polymeric gene-delivery vectors to release an intact DNA payload at the optimal time and subcellular compartment remains a formidable challenge. An ideal vector would provide total protection of complexed DNA from degradation prior to releasing it efficiently near or within the nucleus of a target cell. While optimization of polymer properties, such as molecular weight and charge density, has proved largely inadequate in addressing this challenge, applying polymeric carriers that respond to temperature, light, pH and redox environment to trigger a switch from a tight, protective complex to a more relaxed interaction favouring release at the appropriate time and place has shown promise. Currently, a paucity of gene carriers able to satisfy the contrary requirements of adequate DNA protection and efficient release contributes to the slow progression of non-viral gene therapy towards clinical translation. This review highlights the promising carrier designs that may achieve an optimal balance of DNA protection and release. It also discusses the imaging techniques and three-dimensional in vitro models that can help study these two barriers in the non-viral gene transfer process. Ultimately, efficacious non-viral gene therapy will depend on the combination of intelligent material design, innovative imaging techniques and sophisticated in vitro model systems to facilitate the rational design of polymeric gene-delivery vectors.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in genomics continue to fuel the development of therapeutics that can target pathogenesis at the cellular and molecular level. Typically functional inside the cell, nucleic acid-based therapeutics require an efficient intracellular delivery system. One widely adopted approach is to complex DNA with a gene carrier to form nanocomplexes via electrostatic self-assembly, facilitating cellular uptake of DNA while protecting it against degradation. The challenge lies in the rational design of efficient gene carriers, since premature dissociation or overly stable binding would be detrimental to the cellular uptake and therapeutic efficacy. Nanocomplexes synthesized by bulk mixing showed a diverse range of intracellular unpacking and trafficking behavior, which was attributed to the heterogeneity in size and stability of nanocomplexes. Such heterogeneity hinders the accurate assessment of the self-assembly kinetics and adds to the difficulty in correlating their physical properties to transfection efficiencies or bioactivities. We present a novel convergence of nanophotonics (i.e. QD-FRET) and microfluidics to characterize the real-time kinetics of the nanocomplex self-assembly under laminar flow. QD-FRET provides a highly sensitive indication of the onset of molecular interactions and quantitative measure throughout the synthesis process, whereas microfluidics offers a well-controlled microenvironment to spatially analyze the process with high temporal resolution (~milliseconds). For the model system of polymeric nanocomplexes, two distinct stages in the self-assembly process were captured by this analytic platform. The kinetic aspect of the self-assembly process obtained at the microscale would be particularly valuable for microreactor-based reactions which are relevant to many micro- and nano-scale applications. Further, nanocomplexes may be customized through proper design of microfludic devices, and the resulting QD-FRET polymeric DNA nanocomplexes could be readily applied for establishing structure-function relationships.",

        "Abstract": "During the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, all schools in Singapore implemented twice-daily temperature monitoring for students to curtail the spread of the disease. Students were not allowed to attend school if their temperature readings were >37.8 degrees C for students < or =12 years old, or > or =37.5 degrees C for students >12 years old. These values had been arbitrarily determined with professional inputs. The aim of this study is to determine the reference ranges of normal oral temperatures of students in Singapore and recommend the cut-off values for febrile patients. This may be used in another similar outbreak of an infectious disease with fever.",

        "Abstract": "Electrospinning and electrospraying are facile electrohydrodynamic fabrication methods that can generate drug delivery systems (DDS) through a one-step process. The nanostructured fiber and particle morphologies produced by these techniques offer tunable release kinetics applicable to diverse biomedical applications. Coaxial electrospinning/electrospraying, a relatively new technique of fabricating core-shell fibers/particles have added to the versatility of these DDS by affording a near zero-order drug release kinetics, dampening of burst release, and applicability to a wider range of bioactive agents. Controllable electrospinning/spraying of fibers and particles and subsequent drug release from these chiefly polymeric vehicles depends on well-defined solution and process parameters. The additional drug delivery capability from electrospun fibers can further enhance the material's functionality in tissue engineering applications. This review discusses the state-of-the-art of using electrohydrodynamic technique to generate nanofiber/particles as drug delivery devices.",

        "Abstract": "Although viral gene transfer is efficient in achieving transgene expression for tissue engineering, drawbacks of virus dissemination, toxicity and transient gene expression due to immune response have hindered its widespread application. Many tissue engineering studies thus opt to genetically engineer cells in vitro prior to their introduction in vivo. However, it would be attractive to obviate the need for in vitro manipulation by transducing the infiltrating progenitor cells in situ. This study introduces the fabrication of a virus-encapsulated electrospun fibrous scaffold to achieve sustained and localized transduction. Adenovirus encoding the gene for green fluorescent protein was efficiently encapsulated into the core of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) fibers through co-axial electrospinning and was subsequently released via a porogen-mediated process. HEK 293 cells seeded on the scaffolds expressed high level of transgene expression over a month, while cells inoculated by scaffold supernatant showed only transient expression for a week. RAW 264.7 cells cultured on the virus-encapsulated fibers produced a lower level of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha, suggesting that the activation of macrophage cells by the viral vector was reduced when encapsulated in the core-shell PCL fibers. In demonstrating sustained and localized cell transduction, this study presents an attractive alternative mode of applying viral gene transfer for regenerative medicine.",

        "Abstract": "Oral delivery is the most preferred route of drug administration due to convenience, patient compliance and cost-effectiveness. Despite these advantages it remains difficult to achieve satisfactory bioavailability levels via oral administration due to the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, particularly for biomacromolecules. One promising method to increase the bioavailability of macromolecular drugs such as proteins and nucleic acids is to encapsulate them in nanoparticles before oral administration. This review describes innovative strategies for increasing the efficacy of nanoparticle-mediated delivery to the GI tract. Approaches to optimize nanoparticle formulation by exploiting mucoadhesion, environmental responsiveness and external delivery control mechanisms are discussed. The application of recent advances in nanoparticle synthesis using supercritical fluids, microfluidics and imprint lithography to oral delivery are also presented, as well as possible strategies for incorporating nanoparticles into micro- and macroscale oral delivery devices.",

Rabbits were injected with nanoparticles either intravitreally (IV) or subretinally (SR) and sacrificed 7 days later. Eyes were grossly evaluated for retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities, retinal degeneration, and inflammation. All eyes were cryopreserved and sectioned for analysis of toxicity and expression of either enhanced green or red fluorescent proteins. All of the nanoparticles were able to transfect cells in vitro and in vivo. IV chitosan showed inflammation in 12/13 eyes, whereas IV PCEP and IV MNPs were not inflammatory and did not induce retinal pathology. SR PCEP was nontoxic in the majority of cases but yielded poor transfection, whereas SR MNPs were nontoxic and yielded good transfection. Therefore, we conclude that the best nanoparticle evaluated in vivo was the least toxic nanoparticle tested, the MNP.",

Functional factor VIII protein was detected in plasma by chromogenic and thrombin generation assays, reaching a peak level of 2-4% FVIII at day 22 after delivery. In addition, a bleeding challenge one month after DNA administration resulted in phenotypic correction in 13/20 mice given 250-600 microg of FVIII DNA in chitosan nanoparticles, compared to 1/13 mice given naked FVIII DNA and 0/6 untreated mice. While further optimization would be required to render this type of delivery system practical for hemophilia A gene therapy, the findings suggest the feasibility of oral, non-viral delivery for gene medicine applications.",

        "Abstract": "Sustained release of proteins from aligned polymeric fibers holds great potential in tissue-engineering applications. These protein-polymer composite fibers possess high surface-area-to-volume ratios for cell attachment, and can provide biochemical and topographic cues to enhance tissue regeneration. Aligned biodegradable polymeric fibers that encapsulate human glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF, 0.13 wt%) were fabricated via electrospinning a copolymer of caprolactone and ethyl ethylene phosphate (PCLEEP) with GDNF. The protein was randomly dispersed throughout the polymer matrix in aggregate form, and released in a sustained manner for up to two months. The efficacy of these composite fibers was tested in a rat model for peripheral nerve-injury treatment. Rats were divided into four groups, receiving either empty PCLEEP tubes (control); tubes with plain PCLEEP electrospun fibers aligned longitudinally (EF-L) or circumferentially (EF-C); or tubes with aligned GDNF-PCLEEP fibers (EF-L-GDNF). After three months, bridging of a 15 mm critical defect gap by the regenerated nerve was observed in all the rats that received nerve conduits with electrospun fibers, as opposed to 50% in the control group. Electrophysiological recovery was seen in 20%, 33%, and 44% of the rats in the EF-C, EF-L, and EF-L-GDNF groups respectively, whilst none was observed in the controls. This study has demonstrated that, without further modification, plain electrospun fibers can help in peripheral nerve regeneration; however, the synergistic effect of an encapsulated growth factor facilitated a more significant recovery. This study also demonstrated the novel use of electrospinning to incorporate biochemical and topographical cues into a single implant for in vivo tissue-engineering applications.",

        "Abstract": "Polyelectrolyte complexes have been widely studied as gene carriers in recent years. In this study, poly (ethylene imine) was grafted onto chitosan (PEI-g-CHI) as a nonviral gene carrier in order to improve the water solubility as well as the inherent transfection efficiency of chitosan. We present a novel method to conjugate the amine or hydroxyl groups of chitosan (CHI) and the amine groups of PEI through opening the epoxide rings of ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EX-810), which also brings the merits as mentioned in PEGylation chemistry. The degree of substitution of PEI onto CHI was characterized by NMR. The preliminarily cellular mechanisms, from the cellular entry to the endosomal release, were investigated by the correlations among the physicochemical properties of the DNA-polymer complexes, the buffering capacity of the modified polymer, the cytotoxicity, and the efficiency of the transgene expression. The cytotoxicity assayed by MTT shows that cell viability of PEI-g-CHI is higher than CHI especially noticeable at high concentrations using human kidney 293T cells. The efficiency of transgene expression and the amount of intracellular plasmid were monitored using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The transfection efficiency of PEI-g-CHI/DNA polyplex is significantly better than CHI/DNA polyplex when using the weight ratios higher than 2.5.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate measurements of nuclear deformation, i.e., structural changes of the nucleus in response to environmental stimuli, are important for signal transduction studies. Traditionally, these measurements require labeling and imaging, and then nuclear measurement using image analysis. This approach is time-consuming, invasive, and unavoidably perturbs cellular systems. Light scattering, an emerging biophotonics technique for probing physical characteristics of living systems, offers a promising alternative. Angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry (a/LCI), a novel light scattering technique, was developed to quantify nuclear morphology for early cancer detection. In this study, a/LCI is used for the first time to noninvasively measure small changes in nuclear morphology in response to environmental stimuli. With this new application, we broaden the potential uses of a/LCI by demonstrating high-throughput measurements and by probing aspherical nuclei. To demonstrate the versatility of this approach, two distinct models relevant to current investigations in cell and tissue engineering research are used. Structural changes in cell nuclei due to subtle environmental stimuli, including substrate topography and osmotic pressure, are profiled rapidly without disrupting the cells or introducing artifacts associated with traditional measurements. Accuracy > or = 3% is obtained for the range of nuclear geometries examined here, with the greatest deviations occurring for the more complex geometries. Given the high-throughput nature of the measurements, this deviation may be acceptable for many biological applications that seek to establish connections between morphology and function.",

        "Abstract": "A major challenge for non-viral gene delivery is gaining a mechanistic understanding of the rate-limiting steps. A critical barrier in polyplex-mediated gene delivery is the timely unpacking of polyplexes within the target cell to liberate DNA for efficient gene transfer. In this study, the component plasmid DNA and polymeric gene carrier were individually labeled with quantum dots (QDs) and Cy5 dyes, respectively, as a donor and acceptor pair for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The high signal-to-noise ratio in QD-mediated FRET enabled sensitive detection of discrete changes in polyplex stability. The intracellular uptake and dissociation of polyplexes through QD-FRET was captured over time by confocal microscopy. From quantitative image-based analysis, distributions of released plasmid within the endo/lysosomal, cytosolic, and nuclear compartments formed the basis for constructing a three-compartment first-order kinetics model. Polyplex unpacking kinetics for chitosan, polyethylenimine, and polyphosphoramidate were compared and found to correlate well with transfection efficiencies. Thus, QD-FRET-enabled detection of polyplex stability combined with image-based quantification is a valuable method for studying mechanisms involved in polyplex unpacking and trafficking within live cells. We anticipate that this method will also aid the design of more efficient gene carriers.",

        "Abstract": "Biodegradable polymers were electrospun and recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) was immobilized on the electrospun nanofibers for the purpose of treating diabetic ulcers. Amine-terminated block copolymers composed of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) [PCL] and poly(ethyleneglycol) [PEG] and PCL were electrospun to biocompatible nanofibers with functional amine groups on the surface via PEG linkers. EGF was chemically conjugated to the surface of the nanofibers. The conjugation amount of EGF on the nanofibers was quantitated by X-ray photoelectron scattering. Human primary keratinocytes were cultivated on EGF-conjugated nanofibers in order to investigate the effect of EGF nanofibers on the differentiation of keratinocytes. Wound healing effects of the EGF nanofibers were confirmed in diabetic animals with dorsal wounds. The expression of keratinocyte-specific genes significantly increased with application of EGF-conjugated nanofibers. The EGF-nanofibers exerted superior in vivo wound healing activities compared to control groups or EGF solutions. Furthermore, immunohistochemical-staining results showed that EGF-receptor (EGFR) was highly expressed in the EGF nanofiber group. This study showed that EGF-conjugated nanofiber could potentially be employed as a novel wound healing material by increasing proliferation and phenotypic expression of keratinocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Peripheral nerve regeneration can be enhanced by the stimulation of formation of bands of B\u00fcngner prior to implantation. Aligned electrospun poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) fibers were fabricated to test their potential to provide contact guidance to human Schwann cells. After 7 days of culture, cell cytoskeleton and nuclei were observed to align and elongate along the fiber axes, emulating the structure of bands of B\u00fcngner. Microarray analysis revealed a general down-regulation in expression of neurotrophin and neurotrophic receptors in aligned cells as compared to cells seeded on two-dimensional PCL film. Real-time-PCR analyses confirmed the up-regulation of early myelination marker, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and the down-regulation of NCAM-1, a marker of immature Schwann cells. Similar gene expression changes were also observed on cells cultured on randomly oriented PCL electrospun fibers. However, up-regulation of the myelin-specific gene, P0, was observed only on aligned electrospun fibers, suggesting the propensity of aligned fibers in promoting Schwann cell maturation.",

        "Abstract": "The goal of this study was to engineer cardiac tissue constructs with uniformly anisotropic architecture, and to evaluate their electrical function using multi-site optical mapping of cell membrane potentials. Anisotropic polymer scaffolds made by leaching of aligned sucrose templates were seeded with neonatal rat cardiac cells and cultured in rotating bioreactors for 6-14 days. Cells aligned and interconnected inside the scaffolds and when stimulated by a point electrode, supported macroscopically continuous, anisotropic impulse propagation. By culture day 14, the ratio of conduction velocities along vs. across cardiac fibers reached a value of 2, similar to that in native neonatal ventricles, while action potential duration and maximum capture rate, respectively, decreased to 120ms and increased to approximately 5Hz. The shorter culture time and larger scaffold thickness were associated with increased incidence of sustained reentrant arrhythmias. In summary, this study is the first successful attempt to engineer a cm(2)-size, functional anisotropic cardiac tissue patch.",

        "Abstract": "We have designed a novel dual-functional electrospun fibrous scaffold comprising two fiber mesh layers that were modified differently to induce two separate biological responses from hepatocytes. The first fiber layer was galactosylated on the surface to mediate hepatocyte attachment, while the second layer was loaded with 3-methylcholanthrene (3-Mc) to enhance cytochrome P450 activity of hepatocytes. Primary rat hepatocytes cultured on the galactosylated fibrous scaffolds loaded with different concentrations of 3-Mc were compared for their cell attachment efficiency, albumin secretion activity and cytochrome P450-dependent 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase activity. This hybrid fibrous scaffold mediated hepatocyte attachment with slightly lower efficiency (76+/-2.3%) than a single-layer galactosylated fibrous scaffold (84+/-3.5%). More importantly, the cytochrome P450 activity of the hepatocytes cultured on the hybrid scaffold correlated well with the 3-Mc loading level. The results also showed that transfer of 3-Mc to hepatocytes through direct cell-fiber contact was the dominant transport route, with the induced cytochrome P450 activity being 1.9- to 4.8-fold higher than that of transfer of 3-Mc to hepatocytes via dissolution from fibers to medium. This study demonstrates the feasibility of creating multi-functional fibrous scaffolds that serve both as an adhesive substrate and as a delivery vehicle for bioactive molecules.",

        "Abstract": "The ready availability and low immunogenicity of commercially available mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) render them a potential cell source for the development of therapeutic products. With cell source a major bottleneck in hepatic tissue engineering, we investigated whether commercially available human MSC (hMSC) can transdifferentiate into the hepatic lineage. Based on previous studies that find rapid gain of hepatic genes in bone marrow-derived stem cells cocultured with liver tissue, we used a similar approach to drive hepatic differentiation by coculturing the hMSC with rat livers treated or untreated with gadolinium chloride (GdCl(3)). After a 24-hour coculture period with liver tissue injured by GdCl(3) in a Transwell configuration, approximately 34% of the cells differentiated into albumin-expressing cells. Cocultured cells were subsequently maintained with growth factors to complete the hepatic differentiation. Cocultured cells expressed more hepatic gene markers, and had higher metabolic functions and P450 activity than cells that were only differentiated with growth factors. In conclusion, commercially available hMSC do show hepatic differentiation potential, and a liver microenvironment in culture can provide potent cues to accelerate and deepen the differentiation. The ability to generate hepatocyte-like cells from a commercially available cell source would find interesting applications in liver tissue engineering.",

In this study, we evaluated the biocompatibility and blood compatibility of PEC fiber in order to assess its potential for in vivo applications in tissue engineering. Although chitosan-alginate PEC fibrous scaffold was found to be thrombogenic, the blood compatibility of the scaffold could be significantly improved by incorporating a small amount of heparin in the polyelectrolyte solution during fiber formation. The platelet microparticle production and platelet adhesion on the chitosan-alginate-heparin fibrous scaffold were comparable to those on the resting control. In vitro cytotoxicity test showed that the scaffold was not toxic to human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). In the in vivo biocompatibility test in rats, no acute inflammation was observed in the subcutaneously or intramuscularly implanted specimens. Good cell infiltration and vascularization were observed after 2 months of implantations. Enhanced extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition was observed when hMSCs were cultured in the transforming growth factor-beta3 (TGF-beta3)-encapsulated PEC fibrous scaffold in vitro, or when the TGF-beta3-encapsulated PEC was implanted intramuscularly in vivo. The results showed that this versatile PEC fibrous scaffold could be used in various tissue engineering applications for its good biocompatible and blood compatible properties.",

        "Abstract": "Cartilage tissue engineering strategies generally result in homogeneous tissue structures with little resemblance to the native zonal organization of articular cartilage. The objective of this study was to use bilayered photopolymerized hydrogels to organize zone-specific chondrocytes in a stratified framework and study the effects of this three-dimensional coculture system on the properties of the engineered tissue. Superficial and deep zone chondrocytes from bovine articular cartilage were photoencapsulated in separate hydrogels as well as in adjacent layers of a bilayered hydrogel. Histology, mechanical testing, and biochemical analysis was performed after culturing in vitro. To evaluate the influence of coculture on tissue properties, the layers were separated and compared to constructs containing only superficial or deep cells. In the bilayered constructs, deep cells produced more collagen and proteoglycan than superficial cells, resulting in cartilage tissue with stratified, heterogeneous properties. Deep cells cocultured with superficial cells in the bilayered system demonstrated reduced proliferation and increased matrix synthesis compared to deep cells cultured alone. The bilayered constructs demonstrated greater shear and compressive strength than homogenous cell constructs. This study demonstrated that interactions between zone-specific chondrocytes affect the biological and mechanical properties of engineered cartilage. Strategies aimed to structurally organize zone-specific cells and encourage heterotypic cell interactions may contribute to improved functional properties of engineered cartilage.",

        "Abstract": "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have been shown to trans-differentiate into neuronal-like cells by culture in neuronal induction media, although the mechanism is not well understood. Topography can also influence cellular responses including enhanced differentiation of progenitor cells. As extracellular matrix (ECM) in vivo comprises topography in the nanoscale, we hypothesize that nanotopography could influence stem cell differentiation into specific non-default pathways, such as transdifferentiation of hMSCs. Differentiation and proliferation of hMSCs were studied on nanogratings of 350 nm width. Cytoskeleton and nuclei of hMSCs were aligned and elongated along the nanogratings. Gene profiling and immunostaining showed significant up-regulation of neuronal markers such as microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) compared to unpatterned and micropatterned controls. The combination of nanotopography and biochemical cues such as retinoic acid further enhanced the up-regulation of neuronal marker expressions, but nanotopography showed a stronger effect compared to retinoic acid alone on unpatterned surface. This study demonstrated the significance of nanotopography in directing differentiation of adult stem cells.",

        "Abstract": "The goal of this study was to examine the efficacy of liver-targeted gene delivery by chitosan-DNA nanoparticles through retrograde intrabiliary infusion (RII). The transfection efficiency of chitosan-DNA nanoparticles, as compared with PEI-DNA nanoparticles or naked DNA, was evaluated in Wistar rats by infusion into the common bile duct, portal vein, or tail vein. Chitosan-DNA nanoparticles administrated through the portal vein or tail vein did not produce detectable luciferase expression. In contrast, rats that received chitosan-DNA nanoparticles showed more than 500 times higher luciferase expression in the liver 3 days after RII; and transgene expression levels decreased gradually over 14 days. Luciferase expression in the kidney, lung, spleen, and heart was negligible compared with that in the liver. RII of chitosan-DNA nanoparticles did not yield significant toxicity and damage to the liver and biliary tree as evidenced by liver function analysis and histopathological examination. Luciferase expression by RII of PEI-DNA nanoparticles was 17-fold lower than that of chitosan-DNA nanoparticles on day 3, but it increased slightly over time. These results suggest that RII is a promising routine to achieve liver-targeted gene delivery by non-viral nanoparticles; and both gene carrier characteristics and mode of administration significantly influence gene delivery efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Transfection of DNA vaccines with chemokines may recruit dendritic cells (DCs) locally to capture the antigenic genes and their gene products to generate enhanced CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In this study, we investigated the effects of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, MIP-3 alpha, and MIP-3beta on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Gag DNA vaccination. The chemokine plasmids markedly enhanced the local infiltration of inflammatory cells and increased the presence of CD11c(+) B7.2(+)-activated DCs. MIP-1 alpha and MIP-3 alpha were potent adjuvants in augmenting CTLs and afforded strong protection to immunized animals against challenge with vaccinia virus expressing Gag (vv-Gag). However, decreased humoral response was observed. MIP-3beta plasmid did not dramatically alter immunity. The chemokine inoculation time with respect to DNA vaccine priming was also investigated. The injection of pMIP-3 alpha three days before Gag plasmid (pGag) vaccination markedly increased specific CTLs compared with simultaneous injection and led to higher protection against vv-Gag. Immunity was also shifted toward a T-helper type-1 (Th1) response. In contrast, inoculation with pMIP-3 alpha three days after pGag vaccination shifted immunity toward a Th2 response. Our data suggest that administration of a chemokine with DNA vaccines offers a valuable strategy to modulate the efficacy and polarization of specific immunity and that chemokine-antigen timing is critical in determining overall biological effects.",

The majority of patterning studies on cellular response have been conducted on micropatterned surfaces. Cells clearly respond to the topography of substrates in the micron range in terms of adhesion, proliferation, migration, and gene expression. However, cells in their natural environment also interact with extracellular matrix components in the nanometer scale. This review will cover recent studies that show mammalian cells responding to nanoscale features on a synthetic surface. An important and exciting direction of research in nanomedicine would be to gain a better understanding of the interaction between cells and nanostructures. This will facilitate the creation of the next generation of biomaterials with well-defined nanotopography that can elicit the desired cellular and tissue response.",

        "Abstract": "Stem cells play increasingly prominent roles in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells theoretically allow every cell type in the body to be regenerated. Adult stem cells have also been identified and isolated from every major tissue and organ, some possessing apparent pluripotency comparable to that of ES cells. However, a major limitation in the translation of stem cell technologies to clinical applications is the supply of cells. Advances in biomaterials engineering and scaffold fabrication enable the development of ex vivo cell expansion systems to address this limitation. Progress in biomaterial design has also allowed directed differentiation of stem cells into specific lineages. In addition to delivering biochemical cues, various technologies have been developed to introduce micro- and nano-scale features onto culture surfaces to enable the study of stem cell responses to topographical cues. Knowledge gained from these studies portends the alteration of stem cell fate in the absence of biological factors, which would be valuable in the engineering of complex organs comprising multiple cell types. Biomaterials may also play an immunoprotective role by minimizing host immunoreactivity toward transplanted cells or engineered grafts.",

        "Abstract": "Thermoresponsive polymer (TRP) enables the enzyme-free harvesting of cells through an acute increase in surface hydrophilicity of TRP across its lower critical solution temperature (LCST), rendering feasible the generation of polymer-free cell sheets for regenerative medicine applications. To date, the intricate mechanisms of cell deadhesion/detachment on TRP surface remain obscure. Elucidation of such biophysical responses would be valuable for the cell sheet technology. In this study, integrative biophysical techniques are applied to probe the thermal-induced deadhesion kinetics of smooth muscle cell (SMC) on thermoresponsive hydroxybutyl chitosan (HBC29) against different periods of pre-culture time at 37 degrees C. Atomic force microscopy demonstrates that both the surface topography and mechanical property of HBC29 film in water are acutely modulated across its LCST. Firstly, cells show negligible changes in adhesion contact area during low-temperature incubation on unmodified tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). Secondly, the recession of adhesion contact and retraction of cell body for cells with different pre-culture times are triggered by HBC29 coating on TCPS. Interestingly, the initial rate of reduction in the normalized adhesion contact area of SMC is negatively correlated with the pre-culture time. Thirdly, the degree of cell deformation and average adhesion energy are reducing functions of time only for SMCs with the lowest pre-culture time. In contrast, adhesion energy per cell is a reducing function of time irrespective of the change of pre-culture time. Lastly, the temporal dynamics of cytoskeleton organization and beta-actin/smoothelin-B mRNA expression for SMCs is strongly dependent on the pre-culture time. Overall, this study demonstrates that the thermal-induced deadhesion of SMC on TRP is characterized by the evolution of its contractile phenotypes.",

        "Abstract": "We demonstrate a highly sensitive method to characterize the structural composition and intracellular fate of polymeric DNA nanocomplexes, formed by condensing plasmid DNA with cationic polymers through electrostatic interactions. Rational design of more efficient polymeric gene carriers will be possible only with mechanistic insights of the rate-limiting steps in the non-viral gene transfer process. To characterize the composition and binding dynamics of nanocomplexes, plasmid and its polymer carrier within nanocomplexes were labeled with quantum dots (QDs) and fluorescent organic dyes, respectively, as a donor and acceptor pair for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The high signal-to-noise ratio in QD-mediated FRET enabled precise detection of discrete changes in nanocomplex state at the single-particle level, against various intracellular microenvironments. The distribution and unpacking of individual nanocomplexes within cells could thus be unambiguously followed by fluorescence microscopy. QD-FRET is a highly sensitive and quantitative method to determine the composition and dynamic stability of nanocomplexes during intracellular transport, where barriers to gene delivery may be identified to facilitate gene carrier optimization.",

        "Title": "Co-culture of umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells with human mesenchymal stem cells.",
        "Abstract": "Insufficient numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) sometimes limit allogenic transplantation of umbilical cord blood (UCB). Ex vivo expansion may overcome this limitation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), as non-hematopoietic, well-characterized skeletal and connective-tissue progenitor cells within the bone marrow stroma, have been investigated as support cells for the culture of HSCs/HPCs. MSCs are attractive for the rich environmental signals that they provide and for immunological compatibility in transplantation. Thus far, HSC/MSC co-cultures have mainly been performed in 2-dimensional (2D) configuration. We postulate that a 3-dimensional (3D) culture environment that resembles the natural in vivo hematopoietic compartment might be more conducive for regulating HSC expansion. In this study, we compared the co-culture of HSCs and MSCs in 2D and 3D configurations. The results demonstrated the benefit of MSC inclusion in HSC expansion ex vivo. Direct contact between MSCs and HSCs in 3D cultures led to statistically significantly higher expansion of cord blood CD34+ cells than in 2D cultures (891- versus 545-fold increase in total cells, 96- versus 48-fold increase of CD34+ cells, and 230- versus 150-fold increase in colony-forming cell assay [CFC]). Engraftment assays in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice also indicated a high success rate of hematopoiesis reconstruction with these expanded cells.",

Gene expression and extracellular matrix production showed evidences of chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in the cell-encapsulated scaffolds and cell-seeded scaffolds when the samples were cultured in the chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation media, respectively. However, better cell proliferation and differentiation were observed on the hMSC-encapsulated scaffolds compared to the hMSC-seeded scaffolds. The study demonstrated that the cell-encapsulated PEC fibers could support proliferation and chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of the encapsulated-hMSCs. Together with our previous works, which demonstrated the feasibility of PEC fiber in controlled release of drug, protein and gene delivery, the reported PEC fibrous scaffold system will have the potential in composing a multi-component system for various tissue-engineering applications.",

        "Abstract": "The mechanical and structural properties of a surface play an important role in determining the morphology of attached cells, and ultimately their cellular functions. As such, mechanical and structural integrity are important design parameters for a tissue scaffold. Electrospun fibrous meshes are widely used in tissue engineering. When in contact with electrospun scaffolds, cells see the individual micro- or nanofibres as their immediate microenvironment. In this study, tensile testing of single electrospun nanofibres composed of poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL), and its copolymer, poly(caprolactone-co-ethyl ethylene phosphate) (PCLEEP), revealed a size effect in the Young's modulus, E, and tensile strength, \u03c3(T). Both strength and stiffness increase as the fibre diameter decreases from bulk (\u223c5 \u03bcm) into the nanometre region (200-300 nm). In particular, E and \u03c3(T) of individual PCL nanofibres were at least two-fold and an order of magnitude higher than that of PCL film, respectively. PCL films were observed to have more pronounced crystallographic texture than the nanofibres; however no difference in crystalline fraction, perfection, or texture was detected among the various fibres. When drugs were encapsulated into single PCLEEP fibres, mechanical properties were enhanced with 1-20 wt% of loaded retinoic acid, but weakened by 10-20 wt% of encapsulated bovine serum albumin. This understanding of the effect of size and drug and protein encapsulation on the mechanical properties of electrospun fibres may help in the optimization of tissue scaffold design that combines biochemical and biomechanical cues for tissue regeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Interaction between hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and their extra cellular matrix components is an integral part of the signaling control for HSPC survival, proliferation and differentiation. We hypothesized that both substrate topographical cues and biochemical cues could act synergistically with cytokine supplementation to improve ex vivo expansion of HSPCs. In this study, we compared the ex vivo expansion of human umbilical cord blood CD34(+) cells on unmodified, hydroxylated, carboxylated and aminated nanofibers and films. Results from 10-day expansion cultures showed that aminated nanofiber mesh and film were most efficient in supporting the expansion of the CD34(+)CD45(+) cells (195-fold and 178-fold, respectively), as compared to tissue culture polystyrene (50-fold, p<0.05). In particular, aminated nanofiber meshes supported a higher degree of cell adhesion and percentage of HSPCs, as compared to aminated films. SEM imaging revealed the discrete colonies of cells proliferating and interacting with the aminated nanofibers. This study highlights the potential of a biomaterials approach to influence the proliferation and differentiation of HSPCs ex vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Hyperbranched poly(amino ester)s containing tertiary amines in the core and primary, secondary, and tertiary amines in the periphery, respectively, were evaluated for DNA delivery in vitro. The same core structure facilitated the investigation on the effects of the terminal amine type on the properties of hyperbranched poly(amino ester)s for DNA delivery. The hydrolysis of the poly(amino ester)s was monitored using (1)H NMR. The results reflected that the terminal amine type had negligible effects on the hydrolysis rate but was much slower than that of linear poly(amino ester)s, probably due to the compact hyperbranched spatial structure preventing the accessibility of water. In comparison with PEI 25 K, the hyperbranched poly(amino ester)s showed much lower cytotoxicity in Cos7, HEK293, and HepG2 cells. Gel electrophoresis indicated that poly(amino ester)s could condense DNA efficiently, and the zeta potentials and sizes of the complexes formed with different weight ratios of hyperbranched poly(amino ester)s and DNA were measured. Remarkably, all the hyperbranched poly(amino ester)s showed DNA transfection efficiency comparable to PEI 25 K in Cos7, HEK293, and HepG2 cells regardless of the terminal amine type. Therefore, the terminal amine type had insignificant effects on the hydrolysis rate, cytotoxicity, DNA condensation capability, and in vitro DNA transfection efficiency of the hyperbranched poly(amino ester)s.",

        "Abstract": "Although the field of gene delivery is dominated by viral vectors and synthetic polymeric or lipid gene carriers, natural polymers offer distinct advantages and may help advance the field of non-viral gene therapy. Natural polymers, such as chitosan, have been successful in oral and nasal delivery due to their mucoadhesive properties. Collagen has broad utility as gene activated matrices, capable of delivering large quantities of DNA in a direct, localized manner. Most natural polymers contain reactive sites amenable for ligand conjugation, cross-linking, and other modifications that can render the polymer tailored for a range of clinical applications. Natural polymers also often possess good cytocompatibility, making them popular choices for tissue engineering scaffolding applications. The marriage of gene therapy and tissue engineering exploits the power of genetic cell engineering to provide the biochemical signals to influence proliferation or differentiation of cells. Natural polymers with their ability to serve as gene carriers and tissue engineering scaffolds are poised to play an important role in the field of regenerative medicine. This review highlights the past and present research on various applications of natural polymers as particulate and matrix delivery vehicles for gene delivery.",

        "Abstract": "An efficient and practical ex vivo expansion methodology for human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) is critical in realizing the potential of HSPC transplantation in treating a variety of hematologic disorders and as a supportive therapy for malignant diseases. We report here an expansion strategy using a three-dimensional (3D) scaffold conjugated with an extracellular matrix molecule, fibronectin (FN), to partially mimic the hematopoietic stem cell niche. FN-immobilized 3D polyethylene terephthalate (PET) scaffold was synthesized and evaluated for HSPC expansion efficiency, in comparison with a FN-immobilized 2D PET substrate and a 3D scaffold with FN supplemented in the medium. Covalent conjugation of FN produced substrate and scaffold with higher cell expansion efficiency than that on their unmodified counterparts. After 10 days of culture in serum-free medium, human umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells cultured in FN-conjugated scaffold yielded the highest expansion of CD34+ cells (approximately 100 fold) and long-term culture initiating cells (approximately 47-fold). The expanded human CD34+ cells successfully reconstituted hematopoiesis in NOD/SCID mice. This study demonstrated the synergistic effect between the three-dimensionality of the scaffold and surface-conjugated FN, and the potential of this FN-conjugated 3D scaffold for ex vivo expansion of HSPCs.",

        "Abstract": "Controlled release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) protein by albumin-heparin microparticles administered via intramuscular vaccination in conjunction with HIV DNA vaccines stimulated HIV Gag-specific immune responses. In the murine model, Gag-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and T helper (Th) responses were significantly enhanced by administration of murine GM-CSF microparticles. This effect was comparable to a GM-CSF encoded plasmid. In three of four rhesus monkeys, enhancement of Gag-specific antibody (Ab), Th, and CTL responses was observed 1 month after the first immunization with coadministration of human GM-CSF microparticles and HIV Gag plasmid. The second, third, and fourth booster immunizations, however, did not increase the Gag-specific immune responses. Subsequent application of Gag protein in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) significantly enhanced Ab and Th, but not CTL. However, Gag-specific CTL response was triggered by cytokine and Gag p55-encapsulated microparticles in all animals. The strategy of priming immune responses by coadministration of cytokine microparticles and DNA vaccines, followed by boosting with cytokine and antigen protein-encapsulated microparticles, may prove effective in improving an HIV DNA vaccine design.",

        "Abstract": "Extracellular environment regulates cell behavior and also influences the differentiation of stem cells. Two cell lines of pluriopotent human embryonic germ cell derivatives (EBD cells) were cultured on a biodegradable poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-ethyl ethylene phosphate) (PCLEEP) and non-degradable cellulose acetate scaffold. Their cell behaviors including proliferation, differentiation, cell distribution and extracellular matrix production were studied for 4 weeks and 10 months. The proliferation of the EBD cells was enhanced in both of the three-dimensional scaffolds in the first 5 weeks of culture, regardless of the material difference, compared to monolayer culture. While the gene expression profile remained multilineage for the EBD cells cultured in the cellulose acetate fibrous scaffold, much of the neuronal lineage markers were down-regulated in EBD cells cultured in the PCLEEP scaffold. On the other hand, extracellular matrix production was significantly enhanced in the PCLEEP scaffold. The study showed that the polymer substrate could influence the differentiation and growth of pluripotent stem cells in the absence of exogenous biochemical signals.",

        "Title": "Three-dimensional co-culture of rat hepatocyte spheroids and NIH/3T3 fibroblasts enhances hepatocyte functional maintenance.",
        "Abstract": "Functional maintenance of primary hepatocytes in culture can be improved by several distinct approaches involving optimization of the extracellular matrix microenvironment, media composition and cell-cell interactions, both homotypic and heterotypic. Using a galactose-decorated surface, we have developed a method to combine these two approaches by co-culturing rat primary hepatocyte spheroids with NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast cells. Spheroids were performed by culturing hepatocytes for 3 days on galactosylated poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane; NIH/3T3 cells were subsequently seeded and co-cultured with the spheroids. Results showed that although NIH/3T3 cells alone responded poorly to the galactosylated PVDF surface and displayed limited attachment, NIH/3T3 fibroblasts attached to the periphery of the hepatocyte spheroids and proliferated around them. Co-cultured hepatocyte spheroids exhibited significantly higher liver-specific functions as compared to spheroids cultured alone. Albumin secretion level in this co-culture system peaked on day 11, which was 1.8- and 2.9-times higher than the peak expression level in spheroid homo-culture control in serum-free (day 3) and serum-containing media (day 4), respectively. The albumin secretion function was maintained for at least two weeks; it was 5.1 (in serum-free medium) and 17.8 (in serum-containing medium) times higher than spheroid homo-culture on day 13. Similarly, the co-culture system also expressed approximately 5.5- and 3.1-times higher 3-methylcholanthrene-induced cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity on day 14 as compared to the homo-culture control in serum-free and serum-containing medium, respectively. In conclusion, this unique co-culture system demonstrated the synergistic roles of homotypic cell-cell interaction, heterotypic cell-cell interaction, cell-substrate interaction and soluble stimuli in hepatocyte functional maintenance.",

        "Abstract": "Caspase-3 plays a critical role as an executioner of apoptosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of the combination of caspase-3 gene therapy and radiation treatment. We prepared a plasmid (pCI-CSP3) that contained the human caspase-3 gene and the cytomegalovirus promoter. We introduced this plasmid into U251 and U87 human glioma cells and subjected the cells to radiation treatment. The degree of cell death and apoptosis were evaluated. None of the cell lines underwent apoptosis by the overexpression of caspase-3 alone, but the degree of cell death and apoptosis were markedly enhanced by the addition of radiation treatment. Next, we prepared another plasmid (EGR-CSP3) that contained the caspase-3 gene and a radiation-sensitive promoter. Each treatment system using either pCI-CSP3 or EGR-CSP3 showed radio response. The treatment system using pCI-CSP3 more effectively induced apoptosis than that using EGR-CSP3. Caspase-3 gene therapy in combination with radiation treatment has the potential to serve as a radio-responsive gene therapy without any radiation-sensitive promoter.",

        "Abstract": "Extensive cell-cell or cell-matrix interaction in three-dimensional (3D) culture is important for the maintenance of adult hepatocyte function and the maturation of hepatic progenitors. However, although there is significant interest in inducing the transdifferentiation of adult stem cells into the hepatic lineage, very few studies have been conducted in a 3D culture configuration. The aim of this study is to investigate the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into hepatocytes in a pellet configuration, with or without the presence of small intestinal submucosa (SIS). After 4 weeks of differentiation with growth factors bFGF, HGF, and OsM, we obtained hepatocyte-like cells that expressed a subset of hepatic genes, secreted albumin and urea, stored glycogen, and showed inducible CYP3A4 mRNA levels. When these cells were implanted into livers of hepatectomized rats, they secreted human albumin into the bloodstream. The hepatic differentiation of MSC was faster in cell pellets without SIS. The plausible explanations for this finding may be related to the mass transport issues of the two different pellets and the role of cell-cell contact over cell-matrix interactions. The findings of this study should help in the design of optimal culture configurations for efficient hepatic differentiation of adult stem cells.",

The cooperation effect of complexation of PEO segments with alpha-cyclodextrin and the hydrophobic interaction between PHB blocks resulted in the formation of the supramolecular hydrogel with a strong macromolecular network. The in vitro release kinetics studies of fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled dextran (dextran-FITC) model drug from the hydrogel showed that the hydrogel was suitable for relatively long-term sustained controlled release of macromolecular drugs, which many simple triblock copolymer hydrogel systems could not achieve. The hydrogel was found to be thixotropic and reversible, and can be applied as a promising injectable drug delivery system.",

The formation of polymeric micelles by the two PEO-PHB-PEO triblock copolymers was confirmed with fluorescence technique and TEM. DLS analysis showed that the hydrodynamic radius (R(h)) of the monodistributed polymeric micelles increased with an increase in PEO block length. The relative thermostability of the triblock copolymer micelles was studied by SLS and DLS at different temperatures. The aggregation number and the ratio of the radius of gyration over hydrodynamic radius were found to be independent of temperature, probably due to the strong hydrophobicity of the PHB block. The combination of DLS and SLS studies indicated that the polymeric micelles were composed of a densely packed core of hydrophobic PHB blocks and a corona shell formed by hydrophilic PEO blocks. The aggregation numbers were found to be approximately 53 for PEO-PHB-PEO(2000-810-2000) micelles and approximately 37 for PEO-PHB-PEO(5000-780-5000) micelles. The morphology of PEO-PHB-PEO spherical micelles determined by DLS and SLS measurements was further confirmed by TEM.",

        "Abstract": "We investigated a novel nonwoven fibrous scaffold as a vehicle for delivery of DNA. Fibers were formed by polyelectrolyte complexation of water-soluble chitin and alginate, and PEI-DNA nanoparticles were encapsulated during the fiber drawing process. Nanoparticles released from the fibers over time retained their bioactivity and successfully transfected cells seeded on the scaffold in a sustained manner. Transgene expression in HEK293 cells and human dermal fibroblasts seeded on the transfecting scaffolds was significant even after 2 weeks of culture compared to 3-day expression in two-dimensional controls. Fibroblasts seeded on scaffolds containing DNA encoding basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) demonstrated prolonged secretion of bFGF at levels significantly higher than baseline. This work establishes the potential of this fibrous scaffold as a matrix capable of delivering genes to direct and support cellular development in tissue engineering.",

        "Abstract": "Polyethylenimine-graft-chitosan (PEI-g-chitosan) was synthesized by performing cationic polymerization of aziridine in the presence of water-soluble oligo-chitosan (M(n) = 3400). The absolute molecular weight and chemistry of the PEI-g-chitosan obtained were characterized using GPC, 13C and 1H NMR, respectively. The results indicated that all the amines of chitosan were grafted with oligo-PEI, and the average length of the oligo-PEI side chains was determined by the feed molar ratio of aziridne/amine in chitosan. PEI-g-chitosan of M(n) = 7400 with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.50, and PEI side chains of M(n) = 206 was prepared for gene delivery. Gel electrophoresis showed that DNA migration was retarded completely at a N/P ratio of 2.5/1, indicating good DNA condensation capability of PEI-g-chitosan. The sizes and the zeta-potentials of the complexes of PEI-g-chitosan/DNA were characterized. The cytotoxicity of PEI-g-chiotsan was evaluated, and the results reflected that PEI-g-chitosan had a lower cytotoxicity than PEI (25 K). Gene transfection efficiency of PEI-g-chitosan in HepG2, HeLa, and primary hepatocytes cells and after administration in the common bile duct of rat liver was determined. Remarkably, PEI-g-chitosan showed a higher transfection efficiency than that of PEI (25 K) both in vitro and in vivo. The systematic distribution and the distribution in liver of the gene expression of the complexes of PEI-chitosan/DNA were determined as well.",

        "Abstract": "To overcome the limitations of long-term expression of highly differentiated hepatocyte functions, we have developed a novel bioreactor in which hepatocytes are seeded in a ligand-immobilized hollow fiber cartridge. Galactosylated Pluronic polymer is immobilized on poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) hollow fiber surface through an adsorption scheme yielding a substrate with hepatocyte-specific ligand and a hydrophilic surface layer, which can resist nonspecific protein adsorption and facilitate cell binding to the galactose ligand. Interestingly, the galactosylated PVDF hollow fiber shows enhanced serum albumin diffusion across the membrane. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were seeded and cultured in the extralumenal space of the hollow fiber cartridge for 18 days in a continuously circulated system. Albumin secretion function of the seeded hepatocytes was monitored by analyzing circulating medium by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Urea synthesis and P-450 function (7-ethoxycoumarin dealkylase activity) were measured periodically by doping the circulating medium with NH4Cl and 7-ethoxycoumarin, respectively. Hepatocytes cultured on galactosylated PVDF hollow fibers maintained better albumin secretion and P-450 functions than on unmodified and serum-coated PVDF hollow fibers when cultured in serum-containing medium. Morphological examination by scanning electron microscopy showed that hepatocytes cultured on galactosylated PVDF hollow fibers developed significant aggregation, in contrast to those cultured on unmodified PVDF fibers or on serum-coated PVDF fibers. Transmission electron microscopy images revealed that tight junctions and canaliculus-like structures formed in these aggregates. These results suggest the potential application of this galactosylated PVDF hollow fiber cartridge for the design of a bioartificial liver assist device.",

        "Title": "Surface-immobilization of adhesion peptides on substrate for ex vivo expansion of cryopreserved umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells.",
        "Abstract": "The interaction between integrins and extracellular matrix proteins play an important role in the regulation of hematopoiesis. Human hematopoietic progenitor cells express very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) and VLA-5, which mediate their interaction with fibronectin by recognizing the connecting segment-1 (CS-1 and RGD motifs, respectively. In this study, we investigated the ex vivo expansion of human umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34+ cells on synthetic substrates surface-immobilized with peptides containing the CS-1 binding motif (EILDVPST) and the RGD motif (GRGDSPC). These peptides were covalently conjugated to poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film at a surface density of 2.0-2.3 nmol/cm2. UCB CD34+ cells were cultured for 10 days in serum-free medium supplemented with recombinant human thrombopoietin, stem cell factor, flt3-ligand and interleukin 3. The highest cell expansion fold was observed on the CS-1 peptide-modified surface, where total nucleated cells, total colony forming unit, and long-term culture initiating cells were expanded by 589.6+/-58.6 (mean+/-s.d.), 76.5+/-8.8, and 3.2+/-0.9-fold, respectively, compared to unexpanded cells. All substrates surface-immobilized with peptides, including the control peptides, were more efficient in supporting the expansion of CD34+, CFU-GEMM and LTC-ICs than tissue culture polystyrene surface. Nevertheless, after 10-days of ex vivo expansion from 600 CD34+ cells, only cells cultured on CS-1-immobilized surface yielded positive engraftment, even though the frequency was low. PET surface immobilized with RGD peptide was less efficient than that with CS-1 peptide. Our results suggest that covalently immobilized adhesion peptides can significantly influence the proliferation characteristics of cultured UCB CD34+ cells.",

        "Abstract": "Sustained delivery of heparin to the localized adventitial surface of grafted blood vessels has been shown to prevent the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation that can lead to graft occlusion and failure. In this study heparin was incorporated into electrospun poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) fiber mats for assessment as a controlled delivery device. Fibers with smooth surfaces and no bead defects could be spun from polymer solutions with 8%w/v PCL in 7:3 dichloromethane:methanol. A significant decrease in fiber diameter was observed with increasing heparin concentration. Assessment of drug loading, and imaging of fluorescently labeled heparin showed homogenous distribution of heparin throughout the fiber mats. A total of approximately half of the encapsulated heparin was released by diffusional control from the heparin/PCL fibers after 14 days. The fibers did not induce an inflammatory response in macrophage cells in vitro and the released heparin was effective in preventing the proliferation of VSMCs in culture. These results suggest that electrospun PCL fibers are a promising candidate for delivery of heparin to the site of vascular injury.",

        "Abstract": "New hyperbranched poly(amino ester)s were synthesized via A3 + 2BB'B' ' approach, represented by the Michael addition polymerization of trimethylol-propane triacrylate (TMPTA) (A3-type monomers) with a double molar 1-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine (AEPZ) (BB'B''-type monomer) performed in chloroform at ambient temperature. The results obtained by in situ monitoring the polymerization using NMR and MS indicated that hyperbranched poly(TMPTA1-AEPZ2) was formed via a A(B'B'')2 intermediate, and the B' ' (the formed 2 degrees amine) was kept intact in the reaction. Therefore, poly(TMPTA1-AEPZ2) contained secondary and tertiary amines in the core and primary amines in the periphery similar to polyethylenimine (PEI). The chemistry of protonated poly(TMPTA1-AEPZ2) was further confirmed by 13C NMR, and the molecular weight, the radius of gyration (Rg), and the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) were determined using GPC, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and laser dynamic light scattering (LDLS), respectively. The ratio of Rg/Rh of ca. 1.1 verified the hyperbranched structure. Protonated hyperbranched poly(TMPTA1-AEPZ2) is degradable and less cytotoxic as compared with PEI (25 K). Gel electrophoresis reflected that stable complexes could be formed from protonated hyperbranched poly(TMPTA1-AEPZ2) and DNA, and the size and xi-potential of the complexes were characterized. Remarkably, protonated hyperbranched poly(TMPTA1-AEPZ2) showed transfection efficiency comparable to PEI (25 k) for in vitro DNA delivery.",

        "Abstract": "Human embryonic germ cell derivatives, a heterogeneous population of uncommitted embryoid body derived (EBD) cells, were studied in a bioactive three-dimensional (3D) fibrous culture. Their proliferation, morphology, gene expression and differentiation were investigated to gain insights on development of 3D bioactive scaffold for pluripotent stem cells. The expansion of the EBD cells in 3D environment was significantly higher than their two-dimensional controls after 21 days. No apparent differentiation of the EBD cells cultured in the 3D environment, as indicated by histology and gene expression profile analysis, was evident. Extracellular matrix production was weak in the long-term 3D culture, and the EBD cells maintained their multilineage gene expressions for the period studied. When nerve growth factor (NGF) was surface-immobilized on the fibrous scaffold via chemically-modified Pluronic, the EBD cells cultured in this scaffold showed evidence of entering the neural pathway. An upregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA expression was observed when EBD cells were cultured in the NGF-immobilized fibrous scaffold, as demonstrated by real-time PCR and immunofluorescence staining. The study suggests the value of such fibrous 3D culture in manipulating stem cell proliferation/differentiation and as a model for developing a bioactive scaffold.",

        "Abstract": "This paper reports the studies on micelle formation of new biodegradable amphiphilic poly(ethylene oxide)-poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate]-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PHB-PEO) triblock copolymer with various PHB and PEO block lengths in aqueous solution. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the micelles took an approximately spherical shape with the surrounding diffuse outer shell formed by hydrophilic PEO blocks. The size distribution of the micelles formed by one triblock copolymer was demonstrated by dynamic light scattering technique. The critical micellization phenomena of the copolymers were extensively studied using the pyrene fluorescence dye absorption technique, and the (0,0) band changes of pyrene excitation spectra were used as a probe for the studies. For the copolymers studied in this report, the critical micelle concentrations ranged from 1.3 x 10(-5) to 1.1 x 10(-3) g/mL. For the same PEO block length of 5000, the critical micelle concentrations decreased with an increase in PHB block length, and the change was more significant in the short PHB range. It was found that the micelle formation of the biodegradable amphiphilic triblock copolymers consisting of poly(beta-hydroxyalkanoic acid) and PEO was relatively temperature-insensitive, which is quite different from their counterparts consisting of poly(alpha-hydroxyalkanoic acid) and PEO.",

        "Abstract": "Autologous tumor-specific T lymphocyte (ATTL) lines were derived from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of a healthy volunteer with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -A*0201. These lines were achieved using interleukins -1beta, -2, -4, and -6 and the p53-based peptide from the 264-272 sequence of the wild-type p53 protein with a strong affinity against HLA-A*0201.;The frequencies of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ lymphocytes were 94-96%, 30-34%, and 69-74%, respectively. ATTLs killed most of the T2 cells pulsed with p53-derived peptide, but not against the T2 cells non-pulsed or pulsed with an irrelevant peptide. ATTLs also killed TKB-14 cells, which have been derived from human glioblastoma multiforme, and exhibited HLA-A*0201 molecule and immunohistochemical accumulation of p53 protein. These cytotoxic activities were inhibited by anti-CD3, anti-CD8, and anti-class I antibodies. These findings suggested that these ATTL lines might include CTL populations, which could recognize p53-derived peptide on HLA-A*0201 and the p53-based peptide may play as an antigen on HLA-A*0201. When tumor antigens would be more analyzed in the future, ATTL could be induced without the primary-cultured cells from tumor tissue and could be applied for cancer therapy.",

        "Abstract": "A new biodegradable, photocrosslinkable and multifunctional macromer, poly(6-aminohexyl propylene phosphate) (PPE-HA)-ACRL, was synthesized by conjugation of acrylate groups to the side chains of PPE-HA. By controlling the synthetic conditions, different weight fractions of acrylate in the macromers were achieved as confirmed by 1H NMR. The hydrogels obtained from PPE-HA-ACRL through photocrosslinking were dominantly elastic. With increasing acrylate contents in the macromers, the hydrogels exhibited a lower swelling ratio and higher mechanical strength. The hydrogels with different crosslinking densities lost between 4.3% and 37.4% of their mass in 84 days when incubated in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 degrees C. No significant cytotoxicity of the macromers against bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells from goat (GMSC) was observed at a concentration up to 10mg/ml. Finally, GMSCs encapsulated in the photopolymerized gel maintained their viability when cultured in osteogenic medium for three weeks. Clear mineralization in the hydrogel scaffold was revealed by Von Kossa staining. This study suggests the potential of these biodegradable and photocrosslinkable as injectable tissue engineering scaffolds.",

        "Abstract": "Temperature-responsive polymers are attractive candidates for applications related to injectable delivery of biologically active therapeutics, such as stem cells. In this study, we evaluate the potential of thermosensitive hydroxybutyl chitosan (HBC) as a biomaterial for the culture of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) and cells derived from the intervertebral disk, with the eventual goal of using the HBC polymer as an injectable matrix/cell therapeutic. Conjugation of hydroxybutyl groups to chitosan renders the polymer water soluble and thermally responsive. Below its lower critical solution temperature, a solution of HBC can be maintained indefinitely in its solvated state. Upon exposure to a 37 degrees C environment, within 60 s, a 3.8 wt% HBC solution rapidly forms a gel that can be maneuvered with forceps. Upon cooling, the gel once again is able to revert to its solvated state. The gel exhibits a dramatic increase in both G' and G'' with increasing temperature, signifying a temperature-dependent enhancement of gel mechanical properties. Although a solid structure upon gelation, due to its physical nature of polymer interaction and gel formation, the gel exhibits a fluid-like viscoelastic behavior when exposed to shear stresses of up to 10% strain, with both G' and G'' approaching zero with increasing shear stress. Formulations of HBC gels presented in this study have gelation temperatures ranging from 13.0 to 34.6 degrees C and water contents of 67-95%. Minimal cytotoxicity in MSC and disk cell cultures was observed with these polymers up to a concentration of 5 wt%. Detection of metabolic activity, genetic analysis of synthesized mRNA, and histological staining of MSC and disk cell cultures in these gels collectively indicate cell proliferation without a loss in metabolic activity and extracellular matrix production. This study suggests the potential of HBC gel as an injectable carrier for future applications of delivering therapeutics to encourage a biologically relevant reconstruction of the degenerated disk.",

The cell expansion currently requires repeated cell detachment from solid substrata by enzymatic, chemical or mechanical means. The report here presents a high yield three-dimensional culture and harvest system circumventing the conventional detachment requirements. Cells mixed with dilute cationic collagen were microencapsulated within an ultra-thin shell of synthetic polymers. The cationic collagen could rapidly form a conformal layer of collagen fibers around cells to support cell proliferation and functions. The collagen could be readily removed from cells with a buffer rinse after harvesting from the fragile microcapsules. The cells harvested from this system demonstrate improved attachment, morphology and functions over conventionally cultured cells, upon binding to ligand-conjugated polymer surfaces. The harvested cells can be re-encapsulated and allowed to proliferate again, or used immediately in applications.",

Incorporation of bioactive agents into the fibers could make a biofunctional tissue engineering scaffold. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of encapsulating human beta-nerve growth factor (NGF), which was stabilized in a carrier protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a copolymer of epsilon-caprolactone and ethyl ethylene phosphate (PCLEEP) by electrospinning. Partially aligned protein encapsulated fibers were obtained and the protein was found to be randomly dispersed throughout the electrospun fibrous mesh in aggregate form. A sustained release of NGF via diffusion process was obtained for at least 3 months. PC12 neurite outgrowth assay confirmed that the bioactivity of electrospun NGF was retained, at least partially, throughout the period of sustained release, thus clearly demonstrating the feasibility of encapsulating proteins via electrospinning to produce biofunctional tissue scaffolds.",

        "Abstract": "Controlled release systems for delicate compounds, such as proteins, often suffer the drawbacks of decreased bioactivity and low encapsulation efficiency. This study introduces the concept of producing drug-loaded fibers from interfacial polyelectrolyte complexation. Chitosan-alginate fibers were produced by pulling from the interface between two polyelectrolyte solutions at room temperature. Depending on the component properties, the release time of encapsulated components from these fibers can range from hours to weeks. Dexamethasone was completely released within 2 h, whereas charged compounds such as BSA, PDGF-bb, and avidin showed sustained release for 3 weeks. The fibers were able to release PDGF-bb in a steady fashion for over 3 weeks without an initial burst. Furthermore, the bioactivity of PDGF-bb was retained over this period. Release kinetics could be controlled by the inclusion of heparin, which contains specific binding sites for various growth factors. By varying the alginate/heparin ratios in the anionic polyelectrolyte solution, the release of PDGF-bb could be significantly altered. In this study, interfacial polyelectrolyte complexation has been demonstrated to be a promising technique for producing drug-loaded fibers with high encapsulation efficiency, sustained release kinetics, and capacity to retain the bioactivity of the encapsulants.",

        "Abstract": "Polymer-supported lipid bilayer is a key enabling technology for the design and fabrication of novel biomimetic devices. To date, the physical driving force underlying the formation of polymer-supported lipid bilayer remains to be determined. In this study, the interaction between dipalmitoylphosphocholine (DPPC) vesicle and poly(ethylene terephthalate) [PET] surface with or without grafted poly(acrylic acid) [PAA] layer is examined with several biophysical techniques. First, vesicle deformation analysis shows that the geometry of adherent vesicle on either plain PET or PAA-grafted PET surface is best described by a truncated sphere model. At neutral pH, the degree of deformation and adhesion energy are unaltered by the grafted polymerization of acrylic acid on PET surface. Interestingly, the average magnitude of adhesion energy is increased by 185% and -43% on PAA-grated PET and plain PET surface, respectively, towards an increase of pH at room temperature. Our results demonstrate the possibility of tuning the adhesive interaction between vesicle and polymer cushion through the control of polyelectrolyte ionization on the solid support.",

The cell behavior, including morphology, proliferation, and motility of bovine pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (SMC) were studied on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) surfaces comprising nanopatterned gratings with 350 nm linewidth, 700 nm pitch, and 350 nm depth. More than 90% of the cells aligned to the gratings, and were significantly elongated compared to the SMC cultured on non-patterned surfaces. The nuclei were also elongated and aligned. Proliferation of the cells was significantly reduced on the nanopatterned surfaces. The polarization of microtubule organizing centers (MTOC), which are associated with cell migration, of SMC cultured on nanopatterned surfaces showed a preference towards the axis of cell alignment in an in vitro wound healing assay. In contrast, the MTOC of SMC on non-patterned surfaces preferentially polarized towards the wound edge. It is proposed that this nanoimprinting technology will provide a valuable platform for studies in cell-substrate interactions and for development of medical devices with nanoscale features.",

        "Title": "Biodegradable poly(terephthalate-co-phosphate)s: synthesis, characterization and drug-release properties.",
        "Abstract": "To develop biodegradable polymers with favorable physicochemical and biological properties, we have synthesized a series of poly(terephthalate-co-phosphate)s using a two-step poly-condensation. The diol 1,4-bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate was first reacted with ethylphosphorodichloridate (EOP), and then chain-extended with terephthaloyl chloride (TC). Incorporation of phosphate into the poly(ethylene terephthalate) backbone rendered the co-polymers soluble in chloroform and biodegradable, lowered the Tg, decreased the crystallinity and increased the hydrophilicity. With an EOP/TC molar feed ratio of 80: 20, the polymer exhibited good film-forming property, yielding at 86.6 +/- 1.6% elongation with an elastic modulus of 13.76 +/- 2.66 MPa. This polymer showed a favorable toxicity profile in vitro and good tissue biocompatibility in the muscular tissue of mice. In vitro the polymer lost 21% of mass in 21 days, but only 20% for up to 4 months in vivo. It showed no deterioration of properties after sterilization by gamma-irradiation at 2.5 Mrad on solid CO2. Release of FITC-BSA from the microspheres was diffusion-controlled and exceeded 80% completion in two days. Release of the hydrophobic cyclosporine-A from microspheres was however much more sustained and near zero-ordered, discharging 60% in 70 days. A limited structure-property relationship has been established for this co-polymer series. The co-polymers became more hydrolytically labile as the phosphate component (EOP) was increased and the side chains were switched from the ethoxy to the methoxy structure. Converting the methoxy group to a sodium salt further increased the degradation rate significantly. The chain rigidity as reflected in the Tg values of the co-polymers decreased according to the following diol structure in the backbone: ethylene glycol > 2-methylpropylene diol > 2,2-dimethylpropylene diol. The wide range of physicochemical properties obtainable from this co-polymer series should help the design of degradable biomaterials for specific biomedical applications.",

        "Abstract": "Gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) was encapsulated into biodegradable, bioadhesive polymeric microparticles to enable noninvasive monitoring of their local intravesical delivery with MRI. The microparticles were characterized by contrast agent encapsulation and release kinetics, T(1) relaxation rates, and contrast enhancement in vivo. The level of Gd-DTPA loading into microparticles was 14.3 +/- 0.6 mug/mg polymer. The measured T(1) relaxation rates of the microparticles showed a direct dependence on Gd-DPTA content. Both 1.5T and 4.7T MR scanners were used to image murine bladders instilled intravesically with Gd-DTPA-loaded particles in vivo. MR images showed ring-shaped regions of enhancement inscribing the bladder wall, which were attributed to the microparticles that were preferentially adherent to the mucosa lining the urothelium. The images of controls exhibited no such enhancement. The normalized signal intensities measured from post-instillation images were significantly greater (P < 0.05) than those in the pre-instillation images. Contrast enhancement was observed for at least 5 days after the initial instillation, although the enhancement decreased due to microparticle degradation or mucosa renewal. The localized distribution of biodegradable, bioadhesive microparticles encapsulating Gd-DTPA was successfully visualized with MRI in vivo, allowing particle-mediated delivery to be temporally and spatially monitored noninvasively.",

        "Title": "Galactosylated ternary DNA/polyphosphoramidate nanoparticles mediate high gene transfection efficiency in hepatocytes.",
        "Abstract": "Galactosylated polyphosphoramidates (Gal-PPAs) with different ligand substitution degrees (6.5%, 12.5% and 21.8%, respectively) were synthesized and evaluated as hepatocyte-targeted gene carriers. The in vitro cytotoxicity of Gal-PPA decreased significantly with an increase in galactose substitution degree. The affinity of Gal-PPA/DNA nanoparticles to galactose-recognizing lectin increased with galactose substitution degree. However, decreased transfection efficiency was observed for these galactosylated PPAs in HepG2 cells. Based on the results of gel retardation and polyanion competition assays, we hypothesized that the reduced transfection efficiency of Gal-PPA/DNA nanoparticles was due to their decreased DNA-binding capacity and decreased particle stability. We therefore prepared nanoparticles by precondensing DNA with PPA at a charge ratio of 0.5, yielding nanoparticles with negative surface charge, followed by coating with Gal-PPA, resulting in a Gal-PPA/ DNA/PPA ternary complex. Such a ternary nanoparticle formulation led to significant size reduction in comparison with binary nanoparticles, particularly at low N/P ratios (2 to 5). In HepG2 cells and primary rat hepatocytes, and at low N/P ratios (2 to 5), transfection efficiency mediated by ternary nanoparticles prepared with 6.5% Gal-PPA was 6-7200 times higher than PPA-DPA/DNA nanoparticles. Transgene expression increased slightly at higher N/P ratios in HepG2 cells and reached a plateau at N/P ratios between 5 and 10 for primary rat hepatocytes. Such an enhancement effect was not observed in HeLa cells that lack of asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR). Nevertheless, transfection efficiency of ternary particles decreased dramatically, presumably due to the decreased DNA binding capacity and particle stability, as PPA galactosylation degree increased. This highlights the importance of optimizing ligand conjugation degree for PPA gene carrier.",

        "Abstract": "Poly(propyl acrylic acid) (PPAA) is a polymer specifically designed to disrupt lipid bilayer membranes within a sharply defined pH range. The pH sensitivity can be used to enhance the release of endocytosed drugs into the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell. By incorporating this polymer in a polymeric gene carrier, chitosan, the release of plasmid DNA from the endosomal compartment was enhanced. In vitro transfection studies confirmed that the incorporation of PPAA into the chitosan-DNA nanoparticles enhanced gene expression in both HEK293 and HeLa cells compared to chitosan nanoparticles alone. The dose and time at which PPAA was incorporated during the complex formation affected the release of DNA and transfection efficiency. The optimal dose of PPAA incorporated into the chitosan nanoparticles was determined to be 10 microg, corresponding to a PPAA/DNA weight ratio of 1:1. At this dose, the ternary complexes are approx. 400 nm in size with a net negative surface charge of -17.4 mV. Intracellular trafficking studies confirmed the association of PPAA, DNA and chitosan at 24 h post-transfection and the subsequent release of DNA and PPAA from the chitosan at 48 h. The diffuse appearance of the majority of the DNA and the PPAA at later time points suggests that the PPAA triggered membrane disruption resulting in the release of DNA from the endosomal compartment. Finally, the lack of colocalization between PPAA and Lysotracker indicated that the PPAA-loaded nanoparticles were not trafficked through a lysosomal pathway. This study suggests the promising strategy of including PPAA in the formulation of polymer-DNA complexes for non-viral gene delivery.",

        "Abstract": "Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer represents one of the most efficient polymeric gene carriers. To investigate the effect of the core structure and generation of dendrimers on the complex formation and transfection efficiency, a series of PAMAM dendrimers with a trimesyl core (DT) at different generations (DT4 to DT8) were developed as gene carriers and compared with the PAMAM dendrimers derived from pentaerythritol (DP) and inositol (DI). The minimal generation number of DTs at which the dendrimer has enough amino group density to effectively condense DNA was higher (generation 6) than those of DPs and DIs (generation 5). DTs of generation 6 or higher condensed DNA into complexes with an average diameter ranging from 100 to 300 nm, but the 4th and 5th generations of DT (DT4 and DT5) formed only a severe aggregate with DNA. Interestingly, the DT6/pDNA complex was determined to be much smaller (100-300 nm) than those prepared with DP5 or DI5 (>600 nm) at N/P ratios higher than 15. The optimal generation numbers at which the dendrimers showed the highest transgene expression in COS-7 cells were 5 for DPs and DIs but 6 for DTs. The DT6/pDNAcomplex with smaller size mediated higher transgene expression in COS-7 cells than those prepared with DP5 or DI5. The in vitro transfection efficiency of the DT dendrimers as evaluated in HeLa cells, COS-7 cells, and primary hepatocytes decreased in the order of DT6 > DT7 > DT8 > DT5 > DT4. The transfection mediated by DT6 was significantly inhibited by bafilomycin A1. The acid-base titration curve for DT6 showed high buffer capacity in the pH range from 5.5 to 6.4 (pK(a) approximately 6). This permits dendrimers to buffer the pH change in the endosomal compartment. However, the transfection efficiency mediated by DT6 decreased significantly in the presence of serum in both HeLa cells and COS-7 cells. The cytotoxicity of DTs evaluated in HeLa cells using the 3-{4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl}-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed a trend of increasing toxicity with the polymer generations. The LD50 values of DT4 through DT8 were 628, 236, 79, 82, and 77 microg/mL, respectively, which were higher than that of poly(ethyleneimide) (18 microg/mL) and poly(L-lysine) (28 microg/mL) in the same assay. With a lower cytotoxicity and versatility for chemical conjugation, these PAMAM dendrimers with a DT core warrant further investigation for nonviral gene delivery.",

        "Title": "Ternary complexes comprising polyphosphoramidate gene carriers with different types of charge groups improve transfection efficiency.",
        "Abstract": "To understand the influence of charge groups on transfection mediated by polymer complexes, we have synthesized a series of biodegradable and cationic polyphosphoramidates (PPAs) with an identical backbone but different side chains. Our previous study showed that PPA with a spermidine side chain (PPA-SP) showed high transfection efficiency in culture, whereas PPAs with secondary, tertiary, and quaternary amino groups were significantly less efficient. To investigate whether the coexistence of 1 degrees amino charge groups with 3 degrees and 2 degrees amino charge groups in the DNA/polymer complexes would enhance their transfection efficiency, we evaluated a ternary complex system containing DNA and PPAs with 1 degrees amino groups (PPA-SP) and 3 degrees amino groups (PPA-DMA) and a quaternary complex system containing DNA and PPAs with 1 degrees and 2 degrees and 3 degrees amino groups (PPA-EA/PPA-MEA/PPA-DMA), respectively. Ternary complexes mediated 20 and 160 times higher transfection efficiency in COS-7 cells than complexes of DNA with PPA-SP or PPA-DMA alone, respectively. Similarly, quaternary complexes exhibited 8-fold higher transfection efficiency than PPA-EA/DNA complexes. The mechanism of enhancement in transfection efficiency by the mixture carriers appears to be unrelated to the particle size, zeta potential, or DNA uptake. The titration characterization and the transfection experiments using a proton pump inhibitor suggest that the enhancement effect is unlikely due to the slightly improved buffering capacity of the mixture over PPA-SP. This approach represents a simple strategy of developing polymeric gene carriers and understanding the mechanisms of polymer-mediated gene transfer.",

        "Abstract": "Stem cells have the potential to significantly improve cell and tissue regeneration therapies, but little is understood about how to control their behavior. We investigated the potential differentiation capability of cells derived from human embryonic germ (EG) cells into musculoskeletal lineages by providing a three-dimensional environment with increased cell-cell contact and growth factors. Cells were clustered into pellets to mimic the mesenchyme condensation process during limb development. LVEC cells, an embryoid body-derived (EBD) cell culture generated from EG cells, were cultured in micromass pellets for 21 days in the presence of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and/or transforming growth factor beta-3 (TGFbeta3). Gene expression for cartilage-, bone-, and muscle-specific matrix proteins--including collagen types I, II, III, IX, X; aggrecan; cartilage proteoglycan link protein; cartilage oligomeric protein; chondroitin sulfate-4-S; and myf5--was upregulated in the pellets treated with TGFbeta3, while mRNAs for neurofilament heavy (NFH), a neuron marker, and flk-1, a hematopoietic marker, decreased. Total collagen and proteoglycan production exhibited a time-dependent increase in the pellets treated with TGFbeta3, further confirming the expression of characteristic musculoskeletal markers. Furthermore, our results indicate the ability to select or differentiate stem cells toward a musculoskeletal lineage from a heterogenous EBD cell line.",

        "Abstract": "In this study, we describe a novel in vitro reconstitution system for tracheal epithelium that could be useful for investigating the cellular and molecular interaction of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. In this system, a Transwell insert was used as a basement membrane on which adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were cultured on the lower side whereas normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were cultured on the opposite upper side. Under air-liquid interface conditions, the epithelial cells maintained their capacity to progressively differentiate and form a functional epithelium, leading to the differentiation of mucin-producing cells between days 14 and 21. Analysis of apical secretions showed that mucin production increased over time, with peak secretion on day 21 for NHBE cells alone, whereas mucin secretion by NHBE cells cocultured with MSCs remained constant between days 18 and day 25. This in vitro model of respiratory epithelium, which exhibited morphologic, histologic, and functional features of a tracheal mucosa, could help to understand interactions between mesenchymal and epithelial cells and mechanisms involved in mucus production, inflammation, and airway repair. It might also play an important role in the design of an composite prosthesis for tracheal replacement.",

        "Abstract": "Primary rat hepatocytes self-assemble into multi-cellular spheroids and maintain differentiated functions when cultured on a two-dimensional (2-D) substrate conjugated with galactose ligand. The aim of this study is to investigate how a functional nanofiber scaffold with surface-galactose ligand influences the attachment, spheroid formation and functional maintenance of rat hepatocytes in culture, as compared with the functional 2-D substrate. Highly porous nanofiber scaffolds comprising of fibers with an average diameter of 760 nm were prepared by electrospinning of poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-ethyl ethylene phosphate) (PCLEEP), a novel biodegradable copolymer. Galactose ligand with a density of 66 nmol/cm(2) was achieved on the nanofiber scaffold via covalent conjugation to a poly(acrylic acid) spacer UV-grafted onto the fiber surface. Hepatocytes cultured on the galactosylated PCLEEP nanofiber scaffold exhibited similar functional profiles in terms of cell attachment, ammonia metabolism, albumin secretion and cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity as those on the functional 2-D substrate, although their morphologies are different. Hepatocytes cultured on galactosylated PCLEEP film formed 50-300 microm spheroids that easily detached from surface upon agitation, whereas hepatocytes cultured on galactosylated nanofiber scaffold formed smaller aggregates of 20-100 microm that engulfed the functional nanofibers, resulting in an integrated spheroid-nanofiber construct.",

        "Abstract": "The concept of a \"biostructural unit\" is presented as the combination of biological and structural building blocks to create scaffolds or constructs via a bottom-up approach. Three types of biostructural units were constructed using the process of fiber formation by interfacial polyelectrolyte complexation: protein-encapsulated fiber, ligand-immobilized fiber, and cell-encapsulated fiber units. Water-soluble chitin (WSC) and alginate were used as the polyelectrolyte combination to form fiber. Encapsulation and sustained release of bovine serum albumin from the fiber could be achieved, release profiles being dependent on the WSC/alginate concentration ratio. Released nerve growth factor (NGF) retained its bioactivity, as demonstrated on PC12 cells. Biotinylated fiber could be fabricated by biotinylating alginate before drawing fiber with WSC, enabling biotinylated NGF to be immobilized to fiber via an avidin bridge. The immobilized NGF induced the differentiation of PC12 cells seeded on the fiber. Bovine pulmonary endothelial cells, human dermal fibroblasts, and human mesenchymal stem cells were encapsulated, demonstrating good viability as determined by Live/Dead and WST-1 assays. The assembly of biostructural units into constructs was illustrated by using human mesenchymal stem cell-encapsulated fiber units. Cells in the resulting constructs could be induced to differentiate along chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages.",

The films were examined in terms of their IR spectra, surface and cross-section morphologies, cytotoxicity, and swelling behavior at different pH levels. To assess the potential of these films as a biomedical device, the profiles of the release of model drug from the CS/PEOMA films were examined at pH 4.8. The surface morphology of the films was quite smooth and uniform, and the cross-sectional morphology was dense and homogeneous. The swelling behaviors of CS/PEOMA films were found to depend on the pH of the solution as well as on the CS/PEOMA composition. Drug release from different CS/PEOMA films at pH 4.8 was found to be dependent on film composition. The results showed the potential applicability of CS/PEOMA film as a drug delivery vehicle.",

        "Abstract": "The design of bioartificial liver assist device requires an effective attachment of primary hepatocytes on polymeric biomaterials. A better understanding of this cell-surface interaction would aid the optimal choice of biomaterials. In this study, the adhesion contact dynamics of primary hepatocytes on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) surface with grafted poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and coated collagen is probed with confocal reflectance interference contrast microscopy (C-RICM) in conjunction with phase contrast microscopy. An increase of acrylic acid density from 0 to 12 nmole/cm2 raises both the root-mean-square surface roughness and amount of adsorbed collagen of PET surface. C-RICM demonstrates that hepatocytes form tight adhesion contacts upon seeding on both plain PET and PAA-grafted PET (both with collagen coating) despite the insignificant two-dimensional cell spreading. At two hours after cell seeding, the normalized contact area and adhesion energy of hepatocytes on 12 nmole/cm2 PAA-grafted-PET (with collagen coating) is 27% and 114% higher, respectively, than that on collagen coated plain PET. Interestingly, the growth kinetics of adhesion patch for hepatocyte on PAA-grafted PET with collagen coating is best fitted by R proportional to t0.5 and is significantly different from that on collagen coated plain PET, which is best fitted by R proportional to t0.25. Overall, this study demonstrates the modulation of biophysical response of adherent hepatocytes through the control of the biomaterial surface properties.",

        "Abstract": "A new biodegradable polyphosphoester, poly[[(cholesteryl oxocarbonylamido ethyl) methyl bis(ethylene) ammonium iodide] ethyl phosphate] (PCEP) was synthesized and investigated for gene delivery. Carrying a positive charge in its backbone and a lipophilic cholesterol structure in the side chain, PCEP self-assembled into micelles in aqueous buffer at room temperature with an average size of 60-100 nm. It could bind and protect plasmid DNA from nuclease digestion. Cell proliferation assay indicated a lower cytotoxicity for PCEP than for poly-L-lysine and Lipofectamine. The IC50 determined by the WST-1 assay was 69.8, 51.6, and 12.1 microg/mL for PCEP, Lipofectamine, and poly-L-lysine, respectively. PCEP efficiently delivered DNA to several cell lines such as HEK293, Caco-2, and HeLa. The highest efficiency was achieved when PCEP/DNA complex was prepared in Opti-MEM with a +/- charge ratio of 1.5-2. The transfection efficiency did not change significantly when the complex was used 3 days after preparation. The addition of chloroquine to the formulation increased transfection efficiency 10- to 50-fold compared to the complex alone. In vivo studies showed a luciferase expression by PCEP/DNA complexes in muscle increasing with time during 3 months, although the expression level was lower than that by direct injection of naked DNA. In addition to biodegradability and lower toxicity, the PCEP micelle carrier offers structural versatility. The backbone charge density and the side chain lipophilicity are two parameters that can be varied through copolymerization and monomer variation to optimize the transfection efficiency.",

        "Title": "Evaluation of collagen and methylated collagen as gene carriers.",
        "Abstract": "This study explores the potential of DNA complexes prepared with methylated collagen (MC) and unmodified native collagen (NC) to deliver genes into cells. The physicochemical properties and transfection abilities of these two types of complexes are studied in parallel. MC was prepared by methylation of the carboxyl groups of collagen, rendering the collagen net positively charged at neutral pH. NC/DNA complexes were prepared at pH approximately 3, but aggregated rapidly at neutral pH. These complexes did not confer significant protection to DNA due to its poor stability in serum. MC carried a positive charge at neutral pH and formed complexes with DNA in PBS; therefore MC improved DNA binding ability and the stability of the complexes at physiological conditions. MC/DNA complexes were smaller and more stable than NC/DNA complexes in PBS, and sustained released of DNA from MC/DNA complexes was observed for up to 3 weeks in PBS at 37 degrees C. In contrast, NC/DNA complexes released almost all the DNA within 6h under the same condition. In vitro gene transfection experiments revealed that MC mediated a higher gene expression than NC, although the level of gene expression was still much lower than that achieved with polyethyleneimine/DNA complexes. In contrast to in vitro results, NC/DNA complexes yielded a 3.8-fold higher gene expression than naked DNA and MC/DNA complexes (P < 0.05) at week 2 following intramuscular injection at a DNA dose of 3 microg per muscle and a weight ratio of 1. Higher weight ratios resulted in significant decrease of transfection efficiency, particularly for MC/DNA complexes. The results suggested that gene delivery via the intramuscular route followed a different mechanism that demands a different set of physiochemical properties of the carrier from other parental routes. The potential of these collagen-based gene carriers for other administration routes remain to be further investigated.",

        "Abstract": "Regenerative medicine requires scaffolds of divergent physicochemical properties for different tissue-engineering applications. To this end, a series of biodegradable poly(phosphoester) ionomers of the general composition [p(BHET-EOP-HOP/TC)] was synthesized, with BHET(bis-hydroxyl ethylene phosphate):EOP(ethylene phosphate):HOP(free phosphate) ratios of 60:20:20, 70:10:20, and 75:5:20, respectively. The 60/20/20 ionomer possessed the best tensile properties, exhibiting an average tensile modulus of 68 MPa and strain at break of 31%. Calcium treatment of the ionomer films led to significantly higher hardness and elastic moduli as measured by indentation. Calcium binding was evident from the increase in glass transition and melting temperatures, and a shift in the P-->O absorption in the FTIR spectrum. Stable N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS) of the ionomers could be synthesized to facilitate derivatization, as demonstrated by conjugation of GRGDS in this study. The polymers conjugated with NHS were hydrolyzed in a biphasic mode, with a fast initial phase occurring in the first few hours, followed by a slower phase in the next few days. These ionomers represent a novel class of biomaterials with readily controllable physical and chemical attributes for tissue engineering.",

The biodegradable polymer poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) was used to fabricate microspheres containing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the MRI contrast agent gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). The microspheres were characterized in terms of size, drug and contrast agent encapsulation, and degradation rate. The PLGA microspheres had a mean diameter of 48 +/- 18 microm. The gadolinium loading was 17 +/- 3 microg/mg polymer and the VEGF loading was 163 +/- 22 ng/mg polymer. Electron microscopy revealed that the Gd was dispersed throughout the microspheres and it was confirmed that the Gd loading was sufficient to visualize the microspheres under MRI. VEGF and Gd-DTPA were released from the microspheres in vitro over a period of approximately 6 weeks in three phases: a burst, followed by a slow steady-state, then a rapid steady-state. Biodegradable Gd-doped microspheres can be effectively used to deliver drugs in a sustained manner, while being monitored noninvasively with MRI.",

        "Title": "The effect of the degree of chitosan deacetylation on the efficiency of gene transfection.",
        "Abstract": "Chitosans with various degrees of deacetylation were synthesized by acetylation with acetic anhydride. These chitosans were evaluated for efficacy of nanoparticle formation, DNA binding efficiency, morphology, and in vitro and in vivo gene transfection efficiency. DNA binding efficacy was reduced as degree of deacetylation was decreased, therefore requiring an increased +/-ratio to effect complete DNA complexation. For chitosan with a molecular weight of 390 kDa, the +/-ratio to achieve complete DNA complexation for degrees of deacetylation of 90%, 70% and 62% was 3.3:1, 5.0:1, and 9.0:1, respectively. The size and morphology of these nanoparticle formulations were not significantly different. The decreased degree of deacetylation results in a decrease in overall luciferase expression levels in HEK293, HeLa, and SW756 cells due to particle destabilization in the presence of serum proteins. However, intramuscular luciferase expression levels increased with decreasing deacetylation over the time points tested. Degree of chitosan deacetylation is an important factor in chitosan-DNA nanoparticle formulation as it affects DNA binding, release and gene transfection efficiency in vitro and in vivo.",

        "Title": "Bioadhesive characterization of poly(methylidene malonate 2.12) microparticle on model extracellular matrix.",
        "Abstract": "The efficacy of a drug delivery system is predicated on its retention in the target tissue. Microparticle is one of the most popular and effective drug delivery configurations. Recently, it has been shown that the interaction between drug-loaded microparticles and tissues is related to the effectiveness of paclitaxel delivery to the bladder wall of mice for treating superficial bladder cancer. In this study, the adhesive interaction between poly(methylidene malonate 2.12) or PMM 2.1.2 microparticles and collagen, which serves as the model extracellular matrix for bladder wall, was probed with confocal reflectance interference contrast microscopy (C-RICM), single-particle compressive force measurement and contact mechanics theory. Young's modulus of single PMM 2.1.2 microparticle was determined as 1.56 +/- 0.25 x 10(4)N/m(2). For plain PMM 2.1.2 microparticle in water (pH 5.5), the degree of deformation (a/R) on collagen coated substrate decreased from 0.77 to 0.26 against the increase of mid-plane diameter from 2 to 18 microm. The adhesion energy of PMM 2.1.2 microparticle was determined from Maguis-JKR theory and remained at around 1.5 mJ/m(2) against the increase of particle diameter. At pH 4, the average degree of particle deformation and adhesion energy was increased by 11% and 32%, respectively, in comparison with that at pH 5.5. The loading of paclitaxel in PMM 2.1.2 microspheres enhanced the deformation and adhesion of microspheres at pH 5.5. It is hypothesized that the electrostatic repulsion between paclitaxel and collagen at pH 4 reduces the adhesion energy of PMM 2.1.2-paclitaxel microsphere. This study may offer insight for design of future microparticulate delivery systems by providing the experimental and theoretical tools to study the bioadhesive interaction between drug-loaded microparticles and model extracellular matrices.",

        "Abstract": "New anionic polyelectrolyte tetra-copolymers with photo-crosslinkable 4-(4-methoxycinnamoyl)phenyl methacrylate monomer in addition to a HEMA-MMA-MAA ter-copolymer system were synthesized. The tetra-copolymers were used to form photo-crosslinkable microcapsules with modified collagen by complex coacervation for rat hepatocytes encapsulation. The hepatocytes were encapsulated within a two-layered membrane comprising of modified collagen as the inner core and an outer photo-crosslinkable copolymer shell. Upon photo-crosslinking of the microcapsules with UV-Vis light irradiation, the mechanical strength and chemical stability of the microcapsules, and the cellular functions of the encapsulated hepatocytes were enhanced. Particularly, the mechanical stability of the microcapsules was dramatically strengthened. The new photo-crosslinkable tetra-copolymer formulation described in this article has opened a way to the development of hepatocyte microencapsulation technology for bioartifical liver assist device.",

PPE3 degraded rapidly in PBS 7.4 at 37 degrees C. The cytotoxicity and tissue compatibility assays suggested good biocompatibility of PPE3 in vitro and in vivo. The expression of pVR1255 Luc plasmid in mouse muscle after intramuscular (i.m.) injection of DNA formulated with PPE3 solution in saline was enhanced up to 4-fold compared with that of naked DNA. These results suggest the potential of this polyphosphoester for naked DNA-based gene therapy. The advantages of this polymer design include the biodegradability of the polyphosphoester and its structural versatility, which allows the fine-tuning of the physicochemical properties to optimize the enhancement of gene expression in muscle.",

        "Abstract": "A precise knowledge of the local mechanical and chemical environment around the nerve endings and disc cells in the annulus fibrosus will shed insight on understanding the mechanism of low-back pain and disc degeneration. It would also present an effective tool for the studies of the intervertebral disc structure-function relationship and provide guidance to disc tissue engineering. Experimental difficulties preclude the direct and simultaneous measurement of many of the important physical quantities, such as annulus pressurization, nutrient and electrolyte transport, and mechanical and swelling deformation. Considering that many of these quantities are coupled and that the annulus is highly anisotropic, interpretation of the results would be extremely challenging without an appropriate theoretical framework. In this study, we develop a nonlinear hyperelastic fiber-reinforced continuum mixture theory model for the annulus fibrosus. Special attention is given to the anisotropic nature of the annulus. On the basis of the lamella structure of annulus, and derived from a Helmholtz energy function, a locally transversely isotropic stress-strain relation is adopted for explicit representation of the collagen fiber orientations in general finite deformation situation. The exponential form of the Helmholtz energy function naturally reduces to the infinitesimal deformation form, and the equivalence between the current model coefficients and engineering elastic constants is established under the infinitesimal deformation. This model is able to describe the anisotropic finite and infinitesimal deformation, tension-compression nonlinearity, osmotic swelling, pressurization, electrical potential and current, and water and ion transports as well as the electroneutral nutrient (or growth factor) transport within the annulus.",

        "Abstract": "Tiny tubes with fiber architecture were developed by a novel method of fabrication upon introducing some modification to the microbraiding technique, to function as nerve guide conduit and the feasibility of in vivo nerve regeneration was investigated through several of these conduits. Poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (10:90) polymer fibers being biocompatible and biodegradable were used for the fabrication of the conduits. The microbraided nerve guide conduits (MNGCs) were characterized using scanning electron microscopy to study the surface morphology and fiber arrangement. Degradation tests were performed and the micrographs of the conduit showed that the degradation of the conduit is by fiber breakage indicating bulk hydrolysis of the polymer. Biological performances of the conduits were examined in the rat sciatic nerve model with a 12-mm gap. After implantation of the MNGC to the right sciatic nerve of the rat, there was no inflammatory response. One week after implantation, a thin tissue capsule was formed on the outer surface of the conduit, indicating good biological response of the conduit. Fibrin matrix cable formation was seen inside the MNGC after 1 week implantation. One month after implantation, 9 of 10 rats showed successful nerve regeneration. None of the implanted tubes showed tube breakage. The MNGCs were flexible, permeable, and showed no swelling apart from its other advantages. Thus, these new poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) microbraided conduits can be effective aids for nerve regeneration and repair and may lead to clinical applications.",

The majority of photopolymerizing hydrogels are made from purely synthetic polymers. The purpose of this study was to synthesize and characterize photopolymerizing hydrogels derived from the biopolymer chondroitin sulfate in order to enhance the bioactivity of the scaffold and potentially improve tissue regeneration. Methacrylate groups were added to chondroitin sulfate, a major component of cartilage, using glycidyl methacrylate. The gels exhibited viscoelastic behavior typical of hydrogels. Cogels based on chondroitin sulfate and poly(ethylene glycol) demonstrated increasing pore size with increasing concentration of chondroitin sulfate as determined by water content, mechanical strength, and morphology using scanning electron microscopy. The chondroitin sulfate hydrogels degraded specifically in the presence of the enzyme chondroitinase. Chondrocytes remained viable after photoencapsulation and incubation in the biogels, suggesting their possible use for cartilage tissue engineering.",

        "Abstract": "Galactosylated surface is an attractive substrate for hepatocyte culture because of the specific interaction between the galactose ligand and the asialoglycoprotein receptor on hepatocytes. In this study, we described a scheme to achieve high density of immobilized galactose ligands on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) surface by first surface-grafting polyacrylic acid on plasma-pretreated PET film under UV irradiation, followed by conjugation of a galactose derivative (1-O-(6'-aminohexyl)-D-galactopyranoside) to the grafted polyacrylic acid chains. A high galactose density of 513 nmol/cm(2) on the PET surface was used in this study to investigate the behavior of cultured hepatocyte. This engineered substrate showed high affinity to fluorescein isothiocyanate-lectin binding. Primary rat hepatocytes, when seeded at a density of 2 x 10(5) cells/cm(2), attached to the galactosylated PET substrate at a similar efficiency compared with collagen-coated substrate. The hepatocytes spontaneously formed aggregates 1 day after cell seeding and showed better maintenance of albumin secretion and urea synthesis functions than those cultured on collagen-coated surface.",

        "Abstract": "One of the major challenges in BLAD design is to develop functional substrates suitable for hepatocyte attachment and functional maintenance. In the present study, we designed a poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) surface coated with galactose-tethered Pluronic polymer. The galactose-derived Pluronic F68 (F68-Gal) was adsorbed on PVDF membrane through hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction between PVDF and the polypropylene oxide segment in Pluronic. The galactose density on the modified PVDF surface increased with the concentration of the F68-Gal solution, reaching 15.4 nmol galactosyl groups per cm2 when a 1 mg/ml of F68-Gal solution was used. The adsorbed F68-Gal remained relatively stable in culture medium. Rat hepatocytes attachment efficiency on F68-Gal modified PVDF membrane was similar to that on collagen-coated surface. The attached hepatocytes on PVDF/F68-Gal membrane self-assembled into multi-cellular spheroids after 1 day of culture. These attached hepatocytes in spheroids exhibited higher cell functions such as albumin synthesis and P450 1A1 detoxification function compared to unmodified PVDF membrane and collagen-coated surface. These results suggest the potential of this galactose-immobilized PVDF membrane as a suitable substrate for hepatocyte culture.",

The hydroxyl-terminated precursor polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions were synthesized by free-radical polymerization using 2-hydroxyethanethiol as a chain-transfer agent. The aqueous solutions of the cholesteryl end-capped copolymers exhibited reversible phase transitions at temperatures slightly above human body temperature, with the lower critical solution temperature values being 37.7 and 38.2 degrees C, respectively. The critical micelle concentration values of the two cholesteryl end-capped polymers were 9 and 25 mg/L, respectively. Polymeric micellar nanoparticles were prepared from the amphiphilic polymers using a dialysis method as well as a direct dissolution method. Transmission electron microscope studies showed that the micellar nanoparticles existed in different morphologies, including spherical, star-like, and cuboid shapes. Pyrene as a model hydrophobic compound could be readily encapsulated in these polymeric nanoparticles, at loading levels of 1.0 and 0.8 mg/g for the two cholesteryl end-capped polymers, respectively. The temperature sensitivity and unusual morphology of these novel polymeric nanoparticles would make an interesting drug delivery system.",

        "Abstract": "Cationic polyphosphoesters (PPEs) with different side-chain charge groups were designed and synthesized as biodegradable gene carriers. Poly(N-methyl-2-aminoethyl propylene phosphate) (PPE-MEA), with a secondary amino group (-CH(2)CH(2)NHCH3) side chain released DNA in several hours at N/P (amino group of polymer to phosphate group of DNA) ratios from 0.5 to 5; whereas PPE-HA, bearing -CH(2)(CH2)(4)CH(2)NH(2) groups in the side chain, did not release DNA at the same ratio range for 30 days. Hydrolytic degradation and DNA binding results suggested that side chain cleavage, besides the polymer degradation, was the predominant factor affected the DNA release and transfection efficiencies. The side chain of PPE-MEA was cleaved faster than that of PPE-HA, resulting poor cellular uptake and no transgene expression for PPE-MEA/DNA complexes in COS-7 cells at charge ratios from 4 to 12. In contrast, PPE-HA/DNA complexes were stable enough to be internalized by cells and effected gene transfection (3400 folds higher than background at a charge ratio of 12). Interestingly, gene expression levels mediated by PPE-MEA and PPE-HA in mouse muscle following intramuscular injection of complexes showed a reversed order: PPE-MEA/DNA complexes mediated a 1.5-2-fold higher luciferase expression in mouse muscle as compared with naked DNA injection, while PPE-HA/DNA complexes induced delayed and lowered luciferase expression than naked DNA. These results suggested that the side chain structure is a crucial factor determining the mechanism and kinetics of hydrolytic degradation of PPE carriers, which in turn influenced the kinetics of DNA release from PPE/DNA complexes and their transfection abilities in vitro and in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "We previously encapsulated hepatocytes in ultrathin shell microcapsules and showed them to have enhanced differentiated functions over cells cultured in monolayer. Here we have used these microencapsulated hepatocytes in a bioartificial liver-assisted device (BLAD) with a rat hepatectomy model. Primary rat hepatocytes were encapsulated in 150- to 200-microm microcapsules, using an electrostatic droplet generator. The microencapsulated hepatocytes exhibited good in vitro urea synthesis activity in plasma from rats with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). The ex vivo hemoperfusion was conducted in FHF rats by perfusing plasma at a rate of 1-2 mL/min through 1.5-2 x 10(8) encapsulated hepatocytes packed into a packed-bed bioreactor. Hemoperfusion with the bioreactor was initiated 5 h after operative induction of liver failure and continued for 7 h. The BLAD-treated rats showed improvements over the control groups in survival time and metabolic indicators, including ammonia and total bilirubin levels. Furthermore, expanded bed adsorption (EBA) detoxification technology using Streamline-SP resin was explored to complement the bioreactor with microencapsulated hepatocytes. In vitro experiments indicated that serum ammonia could be specifically removed in dose-dependent manner, whereas the total serum proteins were unaffected by the resin. In ex vivo experiments, hemoperfusion with the resin was initiated 3 h after operative induction of liver failure and continued for 7 h. The resin-treated rats showed obvious serum ammonia removal with no observable total blood protein and blood cell adsorption. Therefore, Streamline-SP resin can potentially be integrated into a BLAD for improved efficacy.",

        "Abstract": "Many biodegradable polymers have been developed for controlled drug delivery. The plethora of drug therapies and types of drugs demand different formulations, fabrications conditions and release kinetics. No one single polymer can satisfy all the requirements. To extend the properties of poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA), we synthesized copolymers of PLA and poly(ethylethylene phosphate) (PEEP) by ring-opening polymerization using Al(Oipr)3 as the initiator. The copolymers were structurally characterized by IR and 1H NMR. DSC data confirmed the formation of random microphase structure in all the copolymers, and showed a decrease of Tg from 43.2 to -22.6 degrees C when the molar content of ethylethylene phosphate (EEP) increased from 5 to 40%. The hydrophilicity of the copolymers increased with EEP content. In contrast to the degradation behavior of PLA, disc samples made of PLAEEP90 showed a linear weight loss profile in PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C. BSA microspheres using PLAEEP90 were prepared by double-emulsion method, yielding a loading level of 4.3% and a loading efficiency of 75%. The BSA release profile consisted of an initial burst (9%) on the first day, followed by a daily 4% release for the following 40 days, resulting in 91% of the BSA release in a near linear manner. The released BSA remained intact according to SDS-PAGE data. Cytotoxicity and histopathology studies showed low toxicity in HeLa cells and good tissue biocompatibility in mouse brain, respectively. PLAEEP is a promising biodegradable polymer for controlled drug delivery.",

        "Abstract": "The goal of gene therapy is to introduce foreign genes into somatic cells to supplement defective genes or provide additional biological functions, and can be achieved using either viral or synthetic non-viral delivery systems. Compared with viral vectors, synthetic gene-delivery systems, such as liposomes and polymers, offer several advantages including ease of production and reduced risk of cytotoxicity and immunogenicity, but their use has been limited by the relatively low transfection efficiency. This problem mainly stems from the difficulty in controlling their properties at the nanoscale. Synthetic inorganic gene carriers have received limited attention in the gene-therapy community, the only notable example being gold nanoparticles with surface-immobilized DNA applied to intradermal genetic immunization by particle bombardment. Here we present a non-viral gene-delivery system based on multisegment bimetallic nanorods that can simultaneously bind compacted DNA plasmids and targeting ligands in a spatially defined manner. This approach allows precise control of composition, size and multifunctionality of the gene-delivery system. Transfection experiments performed in vitro and in vivo provide promising results that suggest potential in genetic vaccination applications.",

Polymeric biodegradable microspheres (mean diameter, 5 microm) were prepared by using a double-emulsion technique to encapsulate DNA-plasmid-encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) genes. With use of gene-delivery catheters, GFP microspheres were locally delivered into the left femoral arterial walls of six pigs; the contralateral arteries were not infused with microspheres and thus served as negative control vessels. The delivery procedures were monitored with high-frequency (8-15-MHz) transducer US. The effectiveness of monitoring with US was compared with the effectiveness of monitoring with immunohistochemical anti-GFP staining. A highly echogenic \"star burst\" sign around the entire vessel wall was seen at US and correlated with immunohistochemical findings that showed the destination of the gene microspheres. Study results demonstrate the potential of US for monitoring catheter-based vascular gene microsphere delivery in vivo.",

This study explored the use of chitosan-DNA nanoparticles for oral immunisation to induce immune responses specific to both the left and right domains of Der p 1. DNA constructs pDer p 1 (1-222) and pDer p 1 (114-222) were complexed with chitosan and delivered orally followed by an i.m. injection of pDer p 1 (1-222) 13 weeks later. Such approach has successfully primed Th1-skewed immune responses against both domains of Der p 1. This strategy could be further optimised for more efficacious gene vaccination for full length Der p 1.",

        "Title": "Injectable drug-delivery systems based on supramolecular hydrogels formed by poly(ethylene oxide)s and alpha-cyclodextrin.",
        "Abstract": "Polymeric hydrogels long have attracted interest for biomaterials applications because of their generally favorable biocompatibility. High in water content, they are particularly attractive for delivery of delicate bioactive agents, such as proteins. However, because they require covalent crosslinking for gelation, many hydrogels can be applied only as implantables, and incorporation of drugs by sorption may be time-consuming and limiting with regard to the loading level. Therefore a delivery formulation where gelation and drug loading can be achieved simultaneously, taking place in an aqueous environment and without covalent crosslinking, would be attractive. Herein is described a new class of injectable and bioabsorbable supramolecular hydrogels formed from poly(ethylene oxide)s (PEOs) and alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD) for controlled drug delivery. The hydrogel formation is based on physical crosslinking induced by supramolecular self-assembling with no chemical crosslinking reagent involved. The supramolecular structure of the hydrogels was confirmed with wide-angle X-ray diffraction studies. The gelation kinetics was found to be dependent on the concentrations of the polymer and alpha-CD as well as on the molecular weight of the PEO used. The rheologic studies of the hydrogels showed that the hydrogels were thixotropic and reversible and that they could be injected through fine needles. The components of the supramolecular hydrogels potentially are biocompatible and nontoxic. Drugs can be encapsulated directly into the hydrogels in situ at room temperature without any contact with organic solvents. The supramolecular hydrogels were evaluated in terms of their in vitro release kinetics. The rate-controlling mechanism of macromolecular drug release might be the erosion of the hydrogels.",

        "Abstract": "Polymers with repeating phosphoester bonds in the backbone are structurally versatile, and biodegradable through hydrolysis, and possibly enzymatic digestion at the phosphoester linkages under physiological conditions. These biodegradable polyphosphoesters are appealing for biological and pharmaceutical applications because of their potential biocompatibility and similarity to bio-macromolecules such as nucleic acids. In the first part of this review, we will focus on one particular structure synthesized by extending oligomeric lactide prepolymers with ethylphosphate groups. This amorphous to semi-crystalline polymer is promising in delivering anti-cancer therapeutics in the form of microspheres. In the second half, we will discuss the conjugation of charged groups to the side chain of the phosphate, constituting one of the few biodegradable cationic polymers in the field for non-viral gene delivery. Capable of delivering exogenous genes to a cell nucleus or providing an extracellular sustained release of DNA, these cationic polyphosphoesters also serve as a valuable model to understand the important characteristics that render a polymer an effective gene carrier.",

        "Abstract": "Prolonged delivery of neurotrophic proteins to the target tissue is valuable in the treatment of various disorders of the nervous system. We have tested in this study whether sustained release of nerve growth factor (NGF) within nerve guide conduits (NGCs), a device used to repair injured nerves, would augment peripheral nerve regeneration. NGF-containing polymeric microspheres fabricated from a biodegradable poly(phosphoester) (PPE) polymer were loaded into silicone or PPE conduits to provide for prolonged, site-specific delivery of NGF. The conduits were used to bridge a 10 mm gap in a rat sciatic nerve model. Three months after implantation, morphological analysis revealed higher values of fiber diameter, fiber population and fiber density and lower G-ratio at the distal end of regenerated nerve cables collected from NGF microsphere-loaded silicone conduits, as compared with those from control conduits loaded with either saline alone, BSA microspheres, or NGF protein without microencapsulation. Beneficial effects on fiber diameter, G-ratio and fiber density were also observed in the permeable PPE NGCs. Thus, the results confirm a long-term promoting effect of exogenous NGF on morphological regeneration of peripheral nerves. The tissue-engineering approach reported in this study of incorporation of a microsphere protein release system into NGCs holds potential for improved functional recovery in patients whose injured nerves are reconstructed by entubulation.",

        "Title": "Microcapsules with improved mechanical stability for hepatocyte culture.",
        "Abstract": "Packed-bed or fluidized-bed bioreactor filled with microencapsulated hepatocytes has been proposed as one of the promising designs for bioartificial liver assist device (BLAD) because of potential advantages of high mass transport rate and optimal microenvironment for hepatocyte culture. Recently, we have developed a microcapsule system for the encapsulation of hepatocytes. The microcapsules consist of an inner core of modified collagen and an outer shell of terpolymer of methyl methacrylate, methacrylate and hydroxyethyl methacrylate. Cells encapsulated in these microcapsules exhibit enhanced cellular functions. Improving the mechanical stability of the microcapsules to withstand the shear stress induced by high perfusion rate would be crucial to the success of BLAD applications. In this study, we investigated the effects of terpolymer molecular weight (M(w)) on the mechanical property of these microcapsules and the differentiated functions of encapsulated hepatocytes. Six terpolymers with different M(w) were synthesized using radical polymerization in solution by adjusting the reaction temperature and the initiator concentration. All the terpolymers formed microcapsules with the methylated collagen. While the terpolymer M(w) had little effect on the capsule membrane thickness and permeability of serum albumin, the mechanical property of the microcapsules was significantly improved by the higher M(w) of the terpolymer. Differentiated functions of the hepatocytes cultured in the microcapsules, including urea synthesis, albumin synthesis and cytochrome P450 metabolic activity, were not significantly affected by the terpolymer M(w).",

        "Title": "Preparation and characterization of polypseudorotaxanes based on block-selected inclusion complexation between poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide) triblock copolymers and alpha-cyclodextrin.",
        "Abstract": "A series of new polypseudorotaxanes were synthesized in high yields when the middle poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) block of poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide) (PPO-PEO-PPO) triblock copolymers was selectively recognized and included by alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD) to form crystalline inclusion complexes (ICs), although the middle PEO block was flanked by two thicker PPO blocks, and a PPO chain had been previously thought to be impenetrable to alpha-CD. X-ray diffraction studies demonstrated that the IC domains of the polypseudorotaxanes assumed a channel-type structure similar to the necklace-like ICs formed by alpha-CD and PEO homopolymers. Solid-state CP/MAS (13)C NMR studies showed that the alpha-CD molecules in the polypseudorotaxanes adopted a symmetrical conformation due to the formation of ICs. The compositions and stoichiometry of the polypseudorotaxanes were studied using (1)H NMR, and a 2:1 (ethylene oxide unit to alpha-CD) stoichiometry was found for all polypseudorotaxanes although the PPO-PEO-PPO triblock copolymers had different compositions and block lengths, suggesting that only the PEO block was closely included by alpha-CD molecules, whereas the PPO blocks were uncovered. The hypothesis was further supported by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies of the polypseudorotaxanes. The glass transitions of the PPO blocks in the polypseudorotaxanes were clearly observed because they were uncovered by alpha-CD and remained amorphous, whereas the glass-transition temperatures increased, because the molecular motion of the PPO blocks was restricted by the hard crystalline phases of the IC domains formed by alpha-CD and the PEO blocks. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the polypseudorotaxanes had better thermal stability than their free components due to the inclusion complexation. Finally, the kinetics of the threading process of alpha-CD onto the copolymers was also studied. The findings reported in this article suggested interesting possibilities in designing other cyclodextrin ICs and polypseudorotaxanes with block structures.",

        "Title": "Adhesion contact dynamics of HepG2 cells on galactose-immobilized substrates.",
        "Abstract": "The specific recognition between asialoglycoprotein receptor and galactose ligand at cell-substrate interfaces has been shown to mediate hepatocyte adhesion and maintain liver specific functions of hepatocytes. Conventionally, the success of hepatocyte attachment on engineered tissue scaffold is inferred from the degree of two-dimensional cell spreading that is measured by transmitted light microscopy. However, the actual contact mechanics and adhesion strength of hepatocytes during two-dimensional cell spreading has not been elucidated due to lack of biophysical probe. In this study, a novel biophysical technique known as confocal reflectance interference contrast microscopy (C-RICM) in conjunction with phase contrast microscopy is utilized to probe the adhesion dynamics, contact mechanics and two-dimensional spreading kinetics of HepG2 cells on galactose immobilized and collagen gel coated substrates. C-RICM demonstrates that HepG2 cells form strong adhesion contacts with both galactose-immobilized surfaces and collagen gel coated substrates. Moreover, HepG2 cells maintain their compact shapes in the presence of asialoglycoprotein receptor-mediated recognition while they become exceedingly spread under integrin-mediated adhesion on collagen gel coated substrate. The initial rate of adhesion contact formation and the steady-state adhesion energy of HepG2 cell population are highest on substrate conjugated with galactose ligand via a longer spacer. The adhesion dynamics and final adhesion energy of HepG2 cells depends both on the type of ligand-receptor interaction and the length of spacer between the ligand and substrate. Most importantly, new biophysical insights into the initial hepatocyte attachment that are critical for hepatocyte culture are provided through the decomposition of two-dimensional spreading and adhesion contact formation on bio-functional substrates.",

        "Abstract": "A new cationic polymer (PPA-SP), polyphosphoramidate bearing spermidine side chain, was prepared as a non-viral vector for gene delivery. PPA-SP was synthesized from poly(1,2-propylene H-phosphonate) by the Atherton-Todd reaction. The weight average molecular weight of PPA-SP was 3.44x10(4) with a number average degree of polymerization of 90, as determined by GPC/LS/RI method. The average net positive charge per polymer chain was 102. PPA-SP was able to condense plasmid DNA efficiently and formed complexes at an N/P ratio (free amino groups in polymer to phosphate groups in DNA) of 2 and above, as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. This new gene carrier offered significant protection to DNA against nuclease degradation at N/P ratios above 2, and showed lower cytotoxicity than PLL and PEI in cell culture. The LD(50) of PPA-SP was 85 microg/ml in COS-7 cells, in contrast to 20 and 42 microg/ml for PLL and PEI, respectively. The complexes prepared in saline at N/P ratios of 5 approximately 10 had an average size of 250 nm and zeta-potential of 26 mV. PPA-SP mediated efficient gene transfection in a number of cell lines, and the transfection protocol was optimized in HEK293 cells using a luciferase plasmid as a marker gene. Gene expression mediated by PPA-SP was greatly enhanced when chloroquine was used in conjunction at a concentration of 100 microM. Under the optimized condition, PPA-SP/DNA complexes yield a luciferase expression level closed to PEI/DNA complexes or Transfast mediated transfection. In a non-invasive CNS gene delivery model, PPA-SP/DNA complexes yielded comparable bcl-2 expression as PEI/DNA complexes in mouse brain stem following injection of the complexes in the tongue.",

        "Abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is often associated in infancy with life-threatening bronchiolitis, which is also a major risk factor for the development of asthma. At present, no effective prophylaxis is available against RSV infection. Herein, we describe an effective prophylactic intranasal gene transfer strategy utilizing chitosan-DNA nanospheres (IGT), containing a cocktail of plasmid DNAs encoding all RSV antigens, except L. A single administration of IGT (25 microg/mouse) induces expression of the mRNA and proteins of all antigens in the lung and results in a significant reduction of viral titers and viral antigen load after acute RSV infection of these mice. IGT-administered mice show no significant change in airway reactivity to methacholine and no apparent pulmonary inflammation. Furthermore, IGT results in significant induction of RSV-specific IgG antibodies, nasal IgA antibodies, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and interferon-gamma production in the lung and splenocytes compared with controls. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of IGT against acute RSV infection.",

        "Abstract": "Controlled delivery of neurotrophic proteins to a target tissue by biodegradable polymer microspheres has been explored widely for its potential applications in the treatment of various disorders in the nervous system. We investigated in this study the potential of polyphosphoester microspheres as carriers for the sustained release of nerve growth factor (NGF), a water-soluble neurotrophic protein. Two polyphosphoesters (PPEs), P(BHET-EOP/TC) and P(DAPG-EOP), as well as poly(lactide/glycolic acid) (PLGA), were used to fabricate microspheres by a W/O/W emulsion and solvent evaporation/extraction method. With bovine serum albumin as a model protein to optimize processing parameters. P(DAPG-EOP) microspheres exhibited a lower burst effect but similar protein entrapment levels and efficiencies when compared with those made of PLGA. Bioactive NGF could be released for at least 10 weeks from the P(DAPG-EOP) microspheres, as confirmed by a neurite outgrowth assay of the PC12 cells. These NGF containing microspheres were incorporated into the nerve guide conduits that were implanted to bridge a 10 mm gap in a rat sciatic nerve model. Two weeks after implantation, immunostaining with an antibody against the neurofilament protein confirmed the presence of axons at the distal end of regenerated cables within the NGF microsphere-loaded conduits. These results demonstrated the feasibility of using biodegradable PPEs for microencapsulation of NGF and provided a basis for future therapeutic application of the microspheres.",

        "Abstract": "We developed a tumor vaccine consisting of fixed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells/tissue fragments, biodegradable microparticles encapsulating granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor and interleukin-2, and an adjuvant. The vaccine protected 33% of syngeneic mice from HCC cell challenge. The vaccine containing human autologous HCC fragments showed essentially no adverse effect in a phase I/IIa clinical trial and 8/12 patients developed a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response against the fragments. Although 2 of 4 DTH-response-negative patients had recurrence after curative resection, the DTH-response-positive patients had no recurrence. The time before the first recurrence in the vaccinated patients was significantly longer than that in 24 historical control patients operated in the same department (P < 0.05). This formulation is a promising candidate to prevent recurrence of human HCC.",
