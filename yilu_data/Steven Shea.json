        "Title": "Identifying an acceptable number of ambulatory blood pressure measurements for accuracy of average blood pressure and nocturnal dipping status.",
        "Abstract": "We aimed to identify the minimum number of ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) measures to accurately determine daytime and nighttime systolic blood pressure (BP) averages and nocturnal dipping status (i.e., relative daytime:nighttime change). A total of 43 midlife participants wore an ABP monitor for 24 h with measurements every 20/30 min during the daytime/nighttime, as identified by a sleep diary. We calculated daytime/nighttime systolic BP average and dipping status from all available measurements per participant (i.e., normative data). We then calculated daytime and nighttime BP per participant based on a random selection of 8-20 and 4-10 measurements and replicated random selections 1,000 times. We calculated accuracy by checking the proportion from 1,000 different randomly selected samples for a particular number of measurements that systolic BP was \u00b15 mmHg of normative data, and dipping status remained unchanged for each participant compared with the normative value. The best fit for the regression model estimated the minimal number of measurements for an accuracy of 95% in BP averages. For a 95% accuracy in estimating daytime and nighttime systolic BP, 11 daytime and 8 nighttime measurements were required. The highest accuracy for dipping status was 91.6\u2009\u00b1\u200913.4% using 20 daytime and 10 nighttime measures, while the lowest was (83.4\u2009\u00b1\u200915.1%) using 8 daytime and 4 nighttime measures. In midlife adults, 11 daytime and 8 nighttime measurements are likely enough to calculate average systolic BPs accurately. However, no minimum number is suggested to accurately calculate dipping status.",

        "Title": "LXR signaling pathways link cholesterol metabolism with risk for prediabetes and diabetes.",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUNDPreclinical studies suggest that cholesterol accumulation leads to insulin resistance. We previously reported that alterations in a monocyte cholesterol metabolism transcriptional network (CMTN) - suggestive of cellular cholesterol accumulation - were cross-sectionally associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here, we sought to determine whether the CMTN alterations independently predict incident prediabetes/T2D risk, and correlate with cellular cholesterol accumulation.METHODSMonocyte mRNA expression of 11 CMTN genes was quantified among 934 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants free of prediabetes/T2D; cellular cholesterol was measured in a subset of 24 monocyte samples.RESULTSDuring a median 6-year follow-up, lower expression of 3 highly correlated LXR target genes - ABCG1 and ABCA1 (cholesterol efflux) and MYLIP (cholesterol uptake suppression) - and not other CMTN genes, was significantly associated with higher risk of incident prediabetes/T2D. Lower expression of the LXR target genes correlated with higher cellular cholesterol levels (e.g., 47% of variance in cellular total cholesterol explained by ABCG1 expression). Further, adding the LXR target genes to overweight/obesity and other known predictors significantly improved prediction of incident prediabetes/T2D.CONCLUSIONThese data suggest that the aberrant LXR/ABCG1-ABCA1-MYLIP pathway (LAAMP) is a major T2D risk factor and support a potential role for aberrant LAAMP and cellular cholesterol accumulation in diabetogenesis.FUNDINGThe MESA Epigenomics and Transcriptomics Studies were funded by NIH grants 1R01HL101250, 1RF1AG054474, R01HL126477, R01DK101921, and R01HL135009.

        "Abstract": "Black-Americans continue to experience pervasive health disparities. Factors contributing to increased disease risk include a general mistrust of biomedical institutions among Black Americans. The purpose of this focus group study was to identify, among Black patients who regularly seek care from a primary provider, salient themes regarding barriers to 1) receiving quality primary care; and 2) adhering to medical recommendations. We examined transcripts of eight focus groups held remotely with 29 Black patients (aged 30-60 years) who had established primary care providers. Using grounded theory and an inductive thematic analysis of the transcripts, we identified three themes (belonging, endurance, and resistance) consistent with Black placemaking theory. Our findings suggest that reducing health disparities for Black Americans will require clinical initiatives that emphasize: 1) attention to social influences on health behavior and to features of medical institutions that mark them as White spaces (belonging); 2) recognition of, as well as sensitivity to, community awareness of the systemic and interpersonal barriers to health and safety that many Black adults endure; and 3) reframing avoidant (resistant) behaviors as protective strategies among Black patients. Examining primary care in this way-through the lens of Black placemaking theory-reveals how culturally meaningful approaches to harnessing the specialized knowledge and resilience that clearly exists among many Black communities can improve health care delivery.",

Newer reports suggest that 4 measurements at night may be enough for cardiovascular risk stratification. Since BP oscillates across the night, the temporal distribution of measurements across the night may impact nighttime BP and dipping%. Therefore, we compared average nighttime BP and dipping% when using measurements in the first half (1",

        "Abstract": "Intraprostatic local radiorecurrence (LRR) after definitive radiation is being increasingly identified due to the implementation of molecular positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging for the evaluation of biochemical recurrence. Salvage high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy offers a promising local therapy option, with encouraging toxicity and efficacy based on early series. Furthermore, the incorporation of advanced imaging allows for focal HDR to further reduce toxicity to maximise the therapeutic ratio. The objectives of the 'focal salvage HDR brachytherapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer in patients treated with prior radiotherapy' (F-SHARP) trial are to determine the acute and late toxicity and efficacy outcomes of focal salvage HDR brachytherapy for LRR prostate cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Hypertension guidelines recommend initiating treatment with single pill combination (SPC) antihypertensive medications, but SPCs are used by only one-third of treated hypertensive US adults. This analysis estimated the cost-effectiveness of initial treatment with SPC dual antihypertensive medications compared with usual care monotherapy in hypertensive US adults.The validated BP Control Model-Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Policy Model simulated initial SPC dual therapy (two half-standard doses in a single pill) compared with initial usual care monotherapy (half-standard dose when baseline systolic BP\u2009<\u200920\u2009mmHg above goal and one standard dose when \u226520\u2009mmHg above goal). Secondary analyses examined equivalent dose monotherapy (one standard dose) and equivalent dose dual therapy as separate pills (two half-standard doses). The primary outcomes were direct healthcare costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over 10 years from a US healthcare sector perspective.At 10 years, initial dual drug SPC was projected to yield 0.028 (95%UI 0.008 to 0.051) more QALYs at no greater cost ($73, 95%UI -$1 983 to $1 629) than usual care monotherapy. In secondary analysis, SPC dual therapy was cost-effective vs. equivalent dose monotherapy (ICER $8 000/QALY gained) and equivalent dose dual therapy as separate pills (ICER $57 000/QALY gained). At average drug prices, initiating antihypertensive treatment with SPC dual therapy is more effective at no greater cost than usual care initial monotherapy and has the potential to improve BP control rates and reduce the burden of CVD in the US.",

Most of these observed rhythms reflect both underlying endogenous circadian rhythms and evoked responses from behaviours such as sleep/wake, eating/fasting, rest/activity, posture changes and exercise. For many research and clinical purposes, it is important to understand the contribution of the endogenous circadian component to these observed rhythms.",

        "Abstract": "Background Although sufficient and healthy sleep is inversely associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors, the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 (LS7), as a measure of cardiovascular health (CVH), did not include sleep. We evaluated an expanded measure of CVH that includes sleep as an eighth metric in relation to CVD risk. Methods and Results The analytic sample consisted of MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) Sleep Study participants who had complete data on sleep characteristics from overnight polysomnography, 7-day wrist actigraphy, validated questionnaires, and the outcome. We computed the LS7 score and 4 iterations of a new CVH score: score 1 included sleep duration, score 2 included sleep characteristics linked to CVD in the literature (sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and obstructive sleep apnea), scores 3 and 4 included sleep characteristics associated with CVD in MESA (score 3: sleep duration and efficiency, daytime sleepiness, and obstructive sleep apnea; score 4: score 3+sleep regularity). Multivariable-adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models evaluated associations of the LS7 and CVH scores 1 to 4 with CVD prevalence and incidence. Among 1920 participants (mean age: 69\u00b19\u2009years; 54% female), there were 95 prevalent CVD events and 93 incident cases (mean follow-up, 4.4\u2009years). Those in the highest versus lowest tertile of the LS7 score and CVH scores 1 to 4 had up to 80% lower odds of prevalent CVD. The LS7 score was not significantly associated with CVD incidence (hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.37-1.04]). Those in the highest versus lowest tertile of CVH score 1, which included sleep duration, and CVH score 4, which included multidimensional sleep health, had 43% and 47% lower incident CVD risk (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.33-0.97]; and hazard ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.32-0.89]), respectively. Conclusions CVH scores that include sleep health predicted CVD risk in older US adults. The incorporation of sleep as a CVH metric, akin to other health behaviors, may enhance CVD primordial and primary prevention efforts. Findings warrant confirmation in larger cohorts over longer follow-up.",

        "Title": "Left Atrial Function and Arrhythmias in Relation to Small Vessel Disease on Brain MRI: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.",
        "Abstract": "Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased stroke risk and accelerated cognitive decline, but the association of early manifestations of left atrial (LA) impairment with subclinical changes in brain structure is unclear. We investigated whether abnormal LA structure and function, greater supraventricular ectopy, and intermittent AF are associated with small vessel disease on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Methods and Results In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, 967 participants completed 14-day ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, speckle tracking echocardiography and, a median 17\u2009months later, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. We assessed associations of LA volume index and reservoir strain, supraventricular ectopy, and prevalent AF with brain magnetic resonance imaging measures of small vessel disease and atrophy. The mean age of participants was 72\u2009years; 53% were women. In multivariable models, LA enlargement was associated with lower white matter fractional anisotropy and greater prevalence of microbleeds; reduced LA strain, indicating worse LA function, was associated with more microbleeds. More premature atrial contractions were associated with lower total gray matter volume. Compared with no AF, intermittent AF (prevalent AF with <100% AF during electrocardiographic monitoring) was associated with lower white matter fractional anisotropy (-0.25 SDs [95% CI, -0.44 to -0.07]) and greater prevalence of microbleeds (prevalence ratio: 1.42 [95% CI, 1.12-1.79]). Conclusions In individuals without a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, alterations of LA structure and function, including enlargement, reduced strain, frequent premature atrial contractions, and intermittent AF, were associated with increased markers of small vessel disease. Detailed assessment of LA structure and function and extended ECG monitoring may enable early identification of individuals at greater risk of small vessel disease.",

        "Abstract": "We assessed the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-mediated cholesterol mass efflux capacity (CMEC) with coronary artery calcium (CAC) score and CAC density. CMEC was measured in 1626 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants in samples obtained between 2000 and 2002 as part of two nested case-control studies, one with cases of incident cardiovascular disease and the other with cases of carotid plaque progression by ultrasound. Cardiac CT examinations for the presence of CAC were performed at baseline and at two additional examinations. CAC scores (Agatston and volume) and density scores (for those with positive CAC) were calculated. Multivariable linear regression modeling per SD increment of CMEC was used to estimate the associations of CMEC with each of these CAC measures. We found no association between higher CMEC and either lower CAC scores or a higher CAC density. We also found no association between higher CMEC and progression of any of these CAC measures. These findings suggest that HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux may be associated with cardiovascular risk via mechanisms unrelated to burden of calcified plaque.",

        "Abstract": "Calcific aortic valve disease, a condition of chronic inflammation, is associated with increased cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs) reduce both acute and chronic inflammation, but their associations with aortic valve calcium (AVC) have not been studied. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis is a prospective cohort study of 6,814 adults without clinical cardiovascular disease. Plasma fatty acid levels and cardiac computed tomography (CT) scans were performed at baseline, and CT scans were performed at subsequent clinical visits over a median 9-year period. We assessed whether plasma levels of O3FAs and their species correlate with the presence, severity, and progression of AVC measured by CT in Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. The mean age of the 6,510 included participants with baseline fatty acid levels, AVC, and covariate data was 62.1 \u00b1 10.2\u00a0years, and 47.1% of the participants were male. Race distribution was 38.6% White, 27.2% Black, 22.1% Hispanic/Latino, and 12.1% Chinese. Among the 6,510 participants, 5,884 had a subsequent CT scan, and 3,304 had a third CT scan with AVC measurements. At baseline, 862 participants (13.2%) had prevalent AVC (Agatston score >0), and were more likely to be of older age, male, of the White race, have a lower education level, and have co-morbidities that are associated with a higher risk for AVC. Plasma tertiles of eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and total O3FA were not associated with prevalent AVC at baseline, incident AVC, or change in AVC. In conclusion, plasma levels of O3FAs in subjects not routinely supplemented with O3FAs are not useful for predicting the presence or development of AVC. Whether high plasma O3FA levels, achievable by high-dose O3FA over-the-counter supplementation or pharmacotherapy, is associated with AVC requires further investigation.",

        "Abstract": "Absolute coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores and CAC percentiles can identify different patient groups, which could be confusing in clinical practice. We aimed to create a simple \"rule of thumb\" for identifying the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association endorsed 75th CAC percentile based on age, gender, and the absolute CAC score. Using the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, we calculated the age and gender-specific percent likelihood that a guideline-based absolute CAC score group (1 to 100, 100 to 300, &gt;300) will place a patient above the 75th percentile. Also, we derived gender-specific age cutoffs by which 95% of participants with any (&gt;0), moderate (\u2265100), or severe (\u2265300) CAC score would be over the 75th percentile. We repeated the analysis using the 90th percentile threshold and also conducted sensitivity analyses stratified by race. Any CAC &gt;0 places 95% of women younger than 60 years and over 90% of men younger than 50 years over the 75th percentile. Moderate absolute CAC scores (&gt;100) place nearly all men &lt;60 years and all women &lt;70 years over the 75th percentile. Confirmatory analysis for age cutoffs was consistent with primary analysis, with cutoffs of 48 years for men and 59 years for women indicating a 95% likelihood that any CAC would place patients over the 75th percentile. In conclusion, our study provides a simple rule of thumb (men &lt;50 years and women &lt;60 years with any CAC, men &lt;60 years and women &lt;70 years with CAC &gt;100) for identifying CAC &gt;75th percentile that might be readily adopted in clinical practice.",

        "Abstract": "Physiological function fluctuates across 24\u2009h due to ongoing daily patterns of behaviors and environmental changes, including the sleep/wake, rest/activity, light/dark, and daily temperature cycles. The internal circadian system prepares the body for these anticipated behavioral and environmental changes, helping to orchestrate optimal cardiovascular and metabolic responses to these daily changes. In addition, circadian disruption, caused principally by exposure to artificial light at night (e.g., as occurs with night-shift work), increases the risk for both cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity and mortality. Regular exercise is a countermeasure against cardiovascular and metabolic risk, and recent findings suggest that the cardiovascular benefits on blood pressure and autonomic control are greater with evening exercise compared to morning exercise. Moreover, exercise can also reset the timing of the circadian system, which raises the possibility that appropriate timing of exercise could be used to counteract circadian disruption. This article introduces the overall functional relevance of the human circadian system and presents the evidence surrounding the concepts that the time of day that exercise is performed can modulate the cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. Further work is needed to establish exercise as a tool to appropriately reset the circadian system following circadian misalignment to preserve cardiovascular and metabolic health. \u00a9 2022 American Physiological Society.

        "Abstract": "Translating our knowledge of the biological aging from animal models to humans may give rise to novel approaches of targeting multiple aging-related diseases simultaneously and increasing health span. Here, for the first time, we use transcriptomic signatures of monocytes to identify biological aging pathways underlying multiple aging-related diseases in humans. The ordinal logistic regression was used to cross-sectionally investigate transcriptomics of the comorbidity index in 1264 community-based Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) adults, 47% Caucasian, 32% Hispanic, 21% African American, and 51% female, aged 55-94\u00a0years. The comorbidity index was defined as the number of prevalent aging-related diseases including cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, hypertension, cancer, dementia, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hip fracture. We identified 708 gene transcripts associated with the comorbidity index (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05) after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and study site. In a weighted gene co-expression network analysis, as postulated, aging-related declines in apoptosis/autophagy (OR\u2009=\u20091.21 per SD increment, p\u2009=\u20090.0006) and ribosome/mitochondrion (OR\u2009=\u20090.90 per SD increment, p\u2009=\u20090.05) were positively associated with the comorbidity index. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, we identified 10 comorbidity-associated modules (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05), including the module of apoptosis/autophagy. There were three inter-correlated modules of these 10 involved in the complement subcomponent C1q, Fc gamma receptor I, and Fc gamma receptor III of the immune system, respectively. Aging-related upregulation of these three modules was positively associated with the comorbidity index. The odds of comorbidity increased with more of these modules acting together in a dose-response fashion. In conclusion, transcriptomic analysis of human immune cells may identify biomarker panels indicative of comprehensive biological mechanisms, especially immune signaling pathways, contributing to health aging.",

        "Abstract": "Over 50,000 children are hospitalized annually for traumatic brain injury (TBI) and face long-term cognitive morbidity. Over 50% develop sleep/wake disturbances (SWDs) that can affect brain development and healing. We hypothesized SWDs would portend worse executive function outcomes in children aged 3\u221218 years with TBI 1\u22123 months after hospital discharge. SWDs were defined using the Sleep Disturbances Scale for Children (t-scores \u2265 60). Outcomes included the Global Executive Composite (GEC, t-score) from the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Second and Preschool Editions, and multiple objective executive function assessments combined through Principal Components Analysis into a Neurocognitive Index (NCI, z-score). Multiple linear regression evaluated associations between SWDs and executive function outcomes, controlling for covariates. Among 131 children, 68% had clinically significant SWDs, which were associated with significantly worse median scores on the GEC (56 vs. 45) and NCI (\u22120.02 vs. 0.42; both p < 0.05). When controlling for baseline characteristics and injury severity in multivariable analyses, SWDs were associated with worse GEC (\u03b2-coefficient = 7.8; 95% Confidence Interval = 2.5, 13.1), and worse NCI (\u03b2-coefficient = \u22120.4; 95% Confidence Interval = \u22120.8, \u22120.04). SWDs in children with TBI are associated with worse executive function outcomes after hospital discharge, and may serve as modifiable targets to improve outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Spontaneous synchronization over large networks is ubiquitous in nature, ranging from inanimate to biological systems. In the human brain, neuronal synchronization and de-synchronization occur during sleep, with the greatest degree of neuronal synchronization during slow wave sleep (SWS). The current sleep classification schema is based on electroencephalography and provides common criteria for clinicians and researchers to describe stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep as well as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These sleep stage classifications have been based on convenient heuristic criteria, with little consideration of the accompanying normal physiological changes across those same sleep stages. To begin to resolve those inconsistencies, first focusing only on NREM sleep, we propose a simple cluster synchronization model to explain the emergence of SWS in healthy people without sleep disorders. We apply the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) analysis to quantify slow wave activity in electroencephalograms, and provide quantitative evidence to support our model. Based on this synchronization model, NREM sleep can be classified as SWS and non-SWS, such that NREM sleep can be considered as an intrinsically bistable process. Finally, we develop an automated algorithm for SWS classification. We show that this new approach can unify brain wave dynamics and their corresponding physiologic changes.",

        "Abstract": "Background Cardiovascular risk factors are associated with cognitive decline and dementia. Magnetic resonance imaging provides sensitive measurement of brain morphology and vascular brain injury. However, associations of risk factors with brain magnetic resonance imaging findings have largely been studied in White participants. We investigated associations of race, ethnicity, and cardiovascular risk factors with brain morphology and white matter (WM) injury in a diverse population. Methods and Results In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, measures were made in 2018 to 2019 of total brain volume, gray matter and WM volume, and WM injury, including WM hyperintensity volume and WM fractional anisotropy. We assessed cross-sectional associations of race and ethnicity and of cardiovascular risk factors with magnetic resonance imaging measures. Magnetic resonance imaging data were complete in 1036 participants; 25% Black, 15% Chinese-American, 19% Hispanic, and 41% White. Mean (SD) age was 72 (8) years and 53% were women. Although WM injury was greater in Black than in White participants in a minimally adjusted model, additional adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and socioeconomic status each attenuated this association, rendering it nonsignificant. Overall, greater average WM hyperintensity volume was associated with older age and current smoking (69% greater vs never smoking); lower fractional anisotropy was additionally associated with higher diastolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive medication, and diabetes. Conclusions We found no statistically significant difference in measures of WM injury by race and ethnicity after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and socioeconomic status. In all racial and ethnic groups, older age, current smoking, hypertension, and diabetes were strongly associated with WM injury.",

        "Abstract": "Night work increases diabetes risk. Misalignment between the central circadian \u201cclock\u201d and daily behaviors, typical in night workers, impairs glucose tolerance, likely due to internal misalignment between central and peripheral circadian rhythms. Whether appropriate circadian alignment of eating can prevent internal circadian misalignment and glucose intolerance is unknown. In a 14-day circadian paradigm, we assessed glycemic control during simulated night work with either nighttime or daytime eating. Assessment of central (body temperature) and peripheral (glucose and insulin) endogenous circadian rhythms happened during constant routine protocols before and after simulated night work. Nighttime eating led to misalignment between central and peripheral (glucose) endogenous circadian rhythms and impaired glucose tolerance, whereas restricting meals to daytime prevented it. These findings offer a behavioral approach to preventing glucose intolerance in shift workers.",

        "Abstract": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the sudden, unexpected death due to abrupt loss of heart function secondary to cardiovascular disease. In certain populations living with cardiovascular disease, SCD follows a distinct 24-hour pattern in occurrence, suggesting day/night rhythms in behavior, the environment, and endogenous circadian rhythms result in daily spans of increased vulnerability. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a workshop, Understanding Circadian Mechanisms of Sudden Cardiac Death to identify fundamental questions regarding the role of the circadian rhythms in SCD. Part 2 summarizes research gaps and opportunities in the areas of population and clinical research identified in the workshop. Established research supports a complex interaction between circadian rhythms and physiological responses that increase the risk for SCD. Moreover, these physiological responses themselves are influenced by several biological variables, including the type of cardiovascular disease, sex, age, and genetics, as well as environmental factors. The emergence of new noninvasive biotechnological tools that continuously measure key cardiovascular variables, as well as the identification of biomarkers to assess circadian rhythms, hold promise for generating large-scale human data sets that will delineate which subsets of individuals are most vulnerable to SCD. Additionally, these data will improve our understanding of how people who suffer from circadian disruptions develop cardiovascular diseases that increase the risk for SCD. Emerging strategies to identify new biomarkers that can quantify circadian health (eg, environmental, behavioral, and internal misalignment) may lead to new interventions and therapeutic targets to prevent the progression of cardiovascular diseases that cause SCD.",

        "Abstract": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD), the unexpected death due to acquired or genetic cardiovascular disease, follows distinct 24-hour patterns in occurrence. These 24-hour patterns likely reflect daily changes in arrhythmogenic triggers and the myocardial substrate caused by day/night rhythms in behavior, the environment, and endogenous circadian mechanisms. To better address fundamental questions regarding the circadian mechanisms, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a workshop, Understanding Circadian Mechanisms of Sudden Cardiac Death. We present a 2-part report of findings from this workshop. Part 1 summarizes the workshop and serves to identify research gaps and opportunities in the areas of basic and translational research. Among the gaps was the lack of standardization in animal studies for reporting environmental conditions (eg, timing of experiments relative to the light dark cycle or animal housing temperatures) that can impair rigor and reproducibility. Workshop participants also pointed to uncertainty regarding the importance of maintaining normal circadian rhythmic synchrony and the potential pathological impact of desynchrony on SCD risk. One related question raised was whether circadian mechanisms can be targeted to reduce SCD risk. Finally, the experts underscored the need for studies aimed at determining the physiological importance of circadian clocks in the many different cell types important to normal heart function and SCD. Addressing these gaps could lead to new therapeutic approaches/molecular targets that can mitigate the risk of SCD not only at certain times but over the entire 24-hour period.",

        "Abstract": "Asthma often worsens at night. To determine if the endogenous circadian system contributes to the nocturnal worsening of asthma, independent of sleep and other behavioral and environmental day/night cycles, we studied patients with asthma (without steroid use) over 3 wk in an ambulatory setting (with combined circadian, environmental, and behavioral effects) and across the circadian cycle in two complementary laboratory protocols performed in dim light, which separated circadian from environmental and behavioral effects: 1) a 38-h \"constant routine,\" with continuous wakefulness, constant posture, 2-hourly isocaloric snacks, and 2) a 196-h \"forced desynchrony\" incorporating seven identical recurring 28-h sleep/wake cycles with all behaviors evenly scheduled across the circadian cycle. Indices of pulmonary function varied across the day in the ambulatory setting, and both laboratory protocols revealed significant circadian rhythms, with lowest function during the biological night, around 4:00 AM, uncovering a nocturnal exacerbation of asthma usually unnoticed or hidden by the presence of sleep. We also discovered a circadian rhythm in symptom-based rescue bronchodilator use (\u03b22-adrenergic agonist inhaler) whereby inhaler use was four times more likely during the circadian night than day. There were additive influences on asthma from the circadian system plus sleep and other behavioral or environmental effects. Individuals with the lowest average pulmonary function tended to have the largest daily circadian variations and the largest behavioral cycle effects on asthma. When sleep was modeled to occur at night, the summed circadian, behavioral/environmental cycle effects almost perfectly matched the ambulatory data. Thus, the circadian system contributes to the common nocturnal worsening of asthma, implying that internal biological time should be considered for optimal therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Risk for adverse cardiovascular events increases when blood pressure does not decrease at night (\"non-dipping,\" <10% decrease from daytime blood pressure). Shiftwork alters relationships between behaviors and endogenous circadian rhythms (i.e., circadian disruption along with variable sleep timing), and chronic shiftwork increases cardiovascular disease risk. To determine whether transitioning into shiftwork changes the overnight blood pressure dipping pattern, we leveraged a natural experiment that occurs when newly-hired bus operators transition from a daytime training schedule into an early-morning shiftwork or daywork schedule. Twenty participants were studied in a 90-day protocol upon new employment and underwent cardio-metabolic health assessments, including ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and weekly sleep-wake diaries. Measurements were repeated after ~30 and 90 days after transitioning to a day or an early-morning shiftwork schedule. Newly-hired shiftworkers displayed dramatic changes in overnight blood pressure, with 62% converting from a healthy dipping blood pressure to the nondipping pattern, resulting in 93% of shiftworkers displaying a nondipping phenotype at 90-days. In contrast, 50% of dayworkers had a nondipping profile at baseline and this decreased to 0% at 90-days, a significant difference from shiftworkers (p = .001). At 90-days, overnight blood pressure dipping was ~7% less in shiftworkers than dayworkers (-6.3% [95%CI -3.7 to -8.8%] vs -13.1% [-10.3 to -15.9%]: p < .01), with changes in dipping associated with changes in sleep timing variability (r2 = .28, p = .03). The observed changes in overnight blood pressure dipping in newly-hired early-morning shiftworkers, which were associated with sleep timing variability, may be an early warning sign of increased cardiovascular risk among shiftworkers.",

        "Abstract": "Reduced patient portal use has previously been reported among Black Americans when compared with that of the general population. This statistic is concerning because portals have been shown to improve the control of chronic conditions that are more prevalent and severe in Black Americans. At their very simplest, portals allow patients to access their electronic health records and often provide tools for patients to interact with their own health information, treatment team members, and insurance companies. However, research suggests that Black American patients have greater concerns over a lack of support, loss of privacy, and reduced personalization of care compared with other Americans, which results in a disparity of portal use.",

        "Title": "Estimating Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial Participant Posttrial Survival Using Pooled Epidemiologic Cohort Data.",
        "Abstract": "Background Intensive systolic blood pressure treatment (<120\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg) in SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) improved survival compared with standard treatment (<140\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg) over a median follow-up of 3.3\u00a0years. We projected life expectancy after observed follow-up in SPRINT using SPRINT-eligible participants in the NHLBI-PCS (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Pooled Cohorts Study). Methods and Results We used propensity scores to weight SPRINT-eligible NHLBI-PCS participants to resemble SPRINT participants. In SPRINT participants, we estimated in-trial survival (<4\u00a0years) using a time-based flexible parametric survival model. In SPRINT-eligible NHLBI-PCS participants, we estimated posttrial survival (\u22654\u00a0years) using an age-based flexible parametric survival model and applied the formula to SPRINT participants to predict posttrial survival. We projected overall life expectancy for each SPRINT participant and compared it to parametric regression (eg, Gompertz) projections based on SPRINT data alone. We included 8584 SPRINT and 10\u00a0593 SPRINT-eligible NHLBI-PCS participants. After propensity weighting, mean (SD) age was 67.9 (9.4) and 68.2 (8.8) years, and 35.5% and 37.6% were women in SPRINT and NHLBI-PCS, respectively. Using the NHLBI-PCS-based method, projected mean life expectancy from randomization was 21.0 (7.4) years with intensive and 19.1 (7.2) years with standard treatment. Using the Gompertz regression, life expectancy was 11.2 (2.3) years with intensive and 10.5 (2.2) years with standard treatment. Conclusions Combining SPRINT and NHLBI-PCS observed data likely offers a more realistic estimate of life expectancy than parametrically extrapolating SPRINT data alone. These results offer insight into the potential long-term effectiveness of intensive SBP goals.",

        "Abstract": "Endogenous circadian rhythms prepare the cardiovascular (CV) system for optimal function to match the daily anticipated behavioral and environmental cycles, including variable activities when awake during the day and recuperation when sleeping at night. The overall day-night patterns in most CV variables result from the summation of predictable circadian effects with variable behavioral and environmental effects on the CV system. The circadian system has also been implicated in the morning peak in the incidence of adverse CV events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden cardiac death. We discuss the resting and stress-reactive circadian control of CV physiology in humans and suggest future research opportunities, including improving CV therapy by optimally timing therapy relative to a person's internal body clock time.",

Approximately 20% of the working population in industrialised countries work permanent or rotating night shifts, exposing this large population to the risk of circadian misalignment-driven disease.

        "Abstract": "Firefighters endure large occupational burdens and generally operate under conditions of chronic sleep deficiency and circadian disruption due to long shifts, plus interrupted sleep due to emergency calls during the night. A typical shift for firefighters is 24-h on/48-h off, and firefighters are expected to use time-off to recover from any sleep debt, while balancing social, family, and home responsibilities. This qualitative study sets out to assess family dynamics and how firefighters prioritize sleep and recovery at home based on relationship or family status, as well as a fire department's current shift schedule.",

        "Abstract": "Cardiac death is the second most prevalent cause in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Paediatric patients with PWS often present cardiac autonomic dysfunction during wakefulness, obesity and sleep-disordered breathing. However, the extent of cardiac autonomic modulation during sleep in PWS has not been documented. The objective of this study was to assess alterations in cardiac autonomic modulation of paediatric patients with PWS during different sleep stages. Thirty-nine participants in three groups: 14 PWS, 13 sex and age-matched lean controls (LG) and 12 obese-matched controls (OB). All participants underwent overnight polysomnography, including continuous electrocardiogram recordings. Heart rate variability (HRV) was analysed during representative periods of each sleep stage through time and frequency domains calculated across 5-min periods. Between-within ANOVAs were employed (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). The results show that total HRV was lower in PWS than OB and LG during slow-wave sleep (SWS) (standard deviation of all NN intervals [SDNN] ms, p\u00a0=\u00a0.006). Parasympathetic modulation assessed by time-domain analysis was lower during SWS in PWS compared to both OB and LG (square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals [RMSSD] ms, p\u00a0=\u00a0.004; SDSD, standard deviation of differences between adjacent NN intervals [SDSD] ms, p\u00a0=\u00a0.02; number of adjacent NN intervals differing by >50\u00a0ms [NN50] ms, p\u00a0=\u00a0.03; proportion of adjacent NN intervals differing by >50\u00a0ms [pNN50] ms, p\u00a0=\u00a0.01). Sympathovagal balance assessed by frequency-domain analysis was lower during both N2 and SWS than during the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage, but not different among groups. In conclusion, this group of paediatric patients with PWS had impaired cardiac autonomic balance due to reduced parasympathetic modulation during SWS. This result could imply an underlying increased cardiovascular risk in PWS even during early age and independent of obesity.",

        "Abstract": "In humans, there is an endogenous, near 24-h (i.e., circadian) variation in mood with the best mood occurring during the circadian day and the worst mood occurring during the circadian night. Only positive affect, and not negative affect, has been shown to contribute to this circadian rhythm. We discovered a sharp circadian peak in negative affect during the circadian night coincident with a circadian trough in positive affect. These findings may help explain the association of depression with insomnia, the increased risk of suicide with nocturnal wakefulness, and the correlation between circadian misalignment and symptom severity in Major Depressive Disorder.",

        "Abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and a change in the 24\u00a0h pattern of adverse cardiovascular events and mortality. Adverse cardiovascular events occur more frequently in the middle of the night in people with OSA, earlier than the morning prevalence of these events in the general population. It is unknown if these changes are associated with a change in the underlying circadian rhythms, independent of behaviors such as sleep, physical activity, and meal intake. In this exploratory analysis, we studied the endogenous circadian rhythms of blood pressure, heart rate, melatonin and cortisol in 11 participants (48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0years; seven with OSA) throughout a 5 day study that was originally designed to examine circadian characteristics of obstructive apnea events. After a baseline night, participants completed 10 recurring 5\u00a0h 20\u00a0min behavioral cycles divided evenly into standardized sleep and wake periods. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded in a relaxed semirecumbent posture 15\u00a0minutes after each scheduled wake time. Salivary melatonin and cortisol concentrations were measured at 1-1.5\u00a0h intervals during wakefulness. Mixed-model cosinor analyses were performed to determine the rhythmicity of all variables with respect to external time and separately to circadian phases (aligned to the dim light melatonin onset, DLMO). The circadian rhythm of blood pressure peaked much later in OSA compared to control participants (group \u00d7 circadian phase, ",

        "Abstract": "Sleep is critical to employees' health and well-being, safety, and performance at work. Sleep leadership refers to supervisor behaviors that aim to improve employees' sleep, such as showing concern for the quantity and quality of employees' sleep. Using a sample of 180 employees and their 91 supervisors working as full-time National Guard military service members, we examined the relationship of sleep leadership and family-supportive supervisor behaviors (FSSB) to employees' sleep. As outcomes we measured objective sleep quality and quantity using validated wrist actigraphy methods, as well as self-reported sleep hygiene, subjective sleep quantity, and subjective sleep quality (sleep disturbance and sleep-related impairment). As a novel contribution to the literature, we included both supervisors' self-reports and employees' reports of supervisors' engagement in sleep leadership and FSSB. Contradicting our hypotheses, our results show that higher employee ratings of FSSB were related to shorter objective sleep time. Regarding self-reported sleep outcomes, higher employees' ratings of sleep leadership were associated with less sleep disturbance and less sleep-related impairment among employees. Higher supervisors' self-ratings of FSSB, in turn, were related to better sleep hygiene and less sleep-related impairment among employees. Overall, our study demonstrates the importance of supportive supervisor behaviors for employees' sleep quality. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).",

        "Title": "Circadian Rhythm of Vascular Function in Midlife Adults.",
        "Abstract": "Objective- Adverse cardiovascular events occur more frequently in the morning than at other times of the day. Vascular endothelial function (VEF)-a robust cardiovascular risk marker-is impaired during this morning period. We recently discovered that this morning impairment in VEF is not caused by either overnight sleep or the inactivity that accompanies sleep. We determined whether the endogenous circadian system is responsible for this morning impairment in VEF. We also assessed whether the circadian system affects mechanistic biomarkers, that is, oxidative stress (malondialdehyde adducts), endothelin-1, blood pressure, and heart rate. Approach and Results- Twenty-one (11 women) middle-aged healthy participants completed a 5-day laboratory protocol in dim light where all behaviors, including sleep and activity, and all physiological measurements were evenly distributed across the 24-hour period. After baseline testing, participants underwent 10 recurring 5-hour 20-minute behavioral cycles of 2-hour 40-minute sleep opportunities and 2 hours and 40 minutes of standardized waking episodes. VEF, blood pressure, and heart rate were measured, and venous blood was sampled immediately after awakening during each wake episode. Independent of behaviors, VEF was significantly attenuated during the subjective night and across the morning ( P=0.04). Malondialdehyde adducts and endothelin-1 exhibited circadian rhythms with increases across the morning vulnerable period and peaks around noon ( P\u22640.01). Both systolic ( P=0.005) and diastolic blood pressure ( P=0.04) were rhythmic with peaks in the late afternoon. Conclusions- The endogenous circadian system impairs VEF and increases malondialdehyde adducts and endothelin-1 in the morning vulnerable hours and may increase the risk of morning adverse cardiovascular events in susceptible individuals.

Stem cell microencapsulation combined with imaging contrast agents may provide a means to simultaneously enhance cell survival and enable cell tracking with noninvasive imaging. Here, we have evaluated a novel MRI- and X-ray-visible microcapsule formulation for allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) delivery and tracking in a large animal model. Bone marrow-derived MSCs from male New Zealand White rabbits were encapsulated using a modified cell encapsulation method to incorporate a dual-modality imaging contrast agent, perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB). PFOB microcapsules (PFOBCaps) were then transplanted into the medial thigh of normal or PAD female rabbits. ",

        "Abstract": "The risk for adverse cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death) peaks in the morning, possibly due to the effects of the endogenous circadian system on cardiovascular risk factors, or the occurrence in the morning of specific triggers, such as mental stress. To assess any interacting effects on cardiovascular function of mental stress and the circadian system, 12 healthy adults underwent a 240-h protocol with all measurements and behaviors scheduled evenly across the circadian cycle. Mental stress was repeatedly induced by performance-motivated serial addition tasks. Cardiovascular measures included hemodynamic function (heart rate, blood pressure), circulating catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine), and estimates of sympathovagal balance and cardiac vagal modulation derived from heart rate variability analyses. Mental stress increased hemodynamic function, sympathovagal balance and epinephrine, and decreased cardiac vagal modulation. Endogenous circadian variation occurred in all cardiovascular measures: sympathovagal balance peaked in the circadian morning (\u223c9\u2009AM), cardiac vagal modulation in the circadian night (\u223c4\u2009AM), and heart rate and circulating catecholamines in the late circadian morning/early afternoon (\u223c12\u2009PM). Importantly, the effects of mental stress and the endogenous circadian system on cardiovascular function occurred in conjunction, such that mental stress in the circadian morning caused greatest sympathovagal balance. This summation of effects could contribute to the increased morning cardiovascular vulnerability.",

        "Abstract": "Objective- To assess the role of HDL (high-density lipoprotein)-mediated cholesterol mass efflux capacity (CMEC) in incident cardiovascular disease and carotid plaque progression. Approach and Results- We measured CMEC in 2 cohorts aged 45 to 84 years at baseline derived from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). Cohort 1 comprised 465 cases with incident cardiovascular disease events during 10 years of follow-up and 465 age- and sex-matched controls; cohort 2 comprised 407 cases with progression of carotid plaque measured by ultrasonography at 2 exams >10 years and 407 similarly matched controls. Covariates and outcome events were ascertained according to the MESA protocol. CMEC level was modestly correlated with HDL cholesterol ( R=0.13; P<0.001) but was not associated with age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use, smoking status, or statin use. Higher CMEC level was significantly associated with lower odds of cardiovascular disease (odds ratio, 0.82 per SD of CMEC [95% CI, 0.69-0.98; P=0.031] in the fully adjusted model) in cohort 1 but higher odds of carotid plaque progression (odds ratio, 1.24 per SD of CMEC [95% CI, 1.04-1.48; P=0.018] in the fully adjusted model) in cohort 2 but without dose-response effect. In subgroup analysis within cohort 1, higher CMEC was associated with lower risk of incident coronary heart disease events (odds ratio, 0.72 per SD of CMEC (95% CI, 0.5-0.91; P=0.007) while no association was found with stroke events. Conclusions- These findings support a role for HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux in an atheroprotective mechanism for coronary heart disease but not stroke.",

        "Abstract": "Measurements of aldosterone for diagnosis of primary aldosteronism are usually made from blood sampled in the morning when aldosterone typically peaks. We tested the relative contributions and interacting influences of the circadian system, ongoing behaviors, and prior sleep to this morning peak in aldosterone. To determine circadian rhythmicity and separate effects of behaviors on aldosterone, 16 healthy participants completed a 5-day protocol in dim light while all behaviors ranging from sleep to exercise were standardized and scheduled evenly across the 24-h circadian period. In another experiment, to test the separate effects of prior nocturnal sleep or the inactivity that accompanies sleep on aldosterone, 10 healthy participants were studied across 2 nights: 1 with sleep and 1 with maintained wakefulness (randomized order). Plasma aldosterone was measured repeatedly in each experiment. Aldosterone had a significant endogenous rhythm ( P < 0.001), rising across the circadian night and peaking in the morning (~8 AM). Activity, including exercise, increased aldosterone, and different behaviors modulated aldosterone differently across the circadian cycle (circadian phase \u00d7 behavior interaction; P < 0.001). In the second experiment, prior nocturnal sleep and prior rested wakefulness both increased plasma aldosterone ( P < 0.001) in the morning, to the same extent as the change in circadian phases between evening and morning. The morning increase in aldosterone is due to effects of the circadian system plus increased morning activities and not prior sleep or the inactivity accompanying sleep. These findings have implications for the time of and behaviors preceding measurement of aldosterone, especially under conditions of shift work and jet lag.",

        "Abstract": "Sleep duration and sleep quality are important predictors of risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). One potential link between sleep health and CVD is through lifestyle factors such as diet. To clarify the association between diet and sleep, we assessed the associations of sleep duration and insomnia symptoms with current Mediterranean-style diet (aMed) and with historical changes in aMed score. Actigraphy-measured sleep duration and self-reported insomnia symptoms categorized as insomnia with short sleep (<6 hr/night), insomnia without short sleep, no insomnia with short sleep, and no insomnia or short sleep were obtained from 2068 individuals who also had dietary intake data. A 10-point aMed score, derived from a self-report food frequency questionnaire, was collected concurrently with the sleep assessment and 10 years before. Compared with individuals who currently reported a low aMed score, those with a moderate-high aMed score were more likely to sleep 6-7 vs. <6 hr/night (p < 0.01) and less likely to report insomnia symptoms occurring with short sleep (vs. no insomnia or short sleep alone; p < 0.05). An increase in aMed score over the preceding 10 years was not associated with sleep duration or insomnia symptoms. However, compared with those with decreasing aMed score, individuals with an unchanging score reported fewer insomnia symptoms (p \u2264 0.01). These results suggest that a Mediterranean-style diet is associated with adequate sleep duration, less insomnia symptoms, and less likely to have insomnia accompanied by short sleep. Further research should identify possible mediators through which diet may promote adequate sleep duration and reduce the risk of insomnia.",

        "Title": "Morning impairment in vascular function is unrelated to overnight sleep or the inactivity that accompanies sleep.",
        "Abstract": "Adverse cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death, occur more frequently in the morning. Prior studies have shown that vascular endothelial function (VEF), a marker of cardiovascular disease, is attenuated during physical inactivity and declines across the night. We sought to determine whether a morning attenuation in VEF is a result of prior sleep or the inactivity that inevitably accompanies sleep. After 1 wk of a rigorously controlled sleep-wake schedule and behaviors, 10 healthy participants completed a randomized crossover protocol in dim light and constant conditions, incorporating a night of 6 h of sleep opportunity and a night of immobility while they were supine and awake. VEF was measured in the dominant brachial artery as flow mediated dilation (FMD) before and after each 6-h trial. To avoid disturbing sleep and posture of the participants, blood was drawn using a 12-ft catheter from an adjoining laboratory room before, during, and after each 6-h trial, and plasma was analyzed for markers of oxidative stress [malondialdehyde adducts (MDA)], and endothelin-1. Contrary to expectation, both nocturnal sleep and nocturnal inactivity significantly increased FMD ( P < 0.05). There was no significant change in MDA or endothelin-1 within and between trials. Contrary to expectations based on prior studies, we found that overnight sleep or the inactivity that accompanies sleep did not result in attenuation in VEF in the morning hours in healthy people. Thus, it is plausible that the endogenous circadian system, a remaining factor not studied here, is responsible for the commonly observed decline in VEF across the night.",

        "Abstract": "All species organize behaviors to optimally match daily changes in the environment, leading to pronounced activity/rest cycles that track the light/dark cycle. Endogenous, approximately 24-hour circadian rhythms in the brain, autonomic nervous system, heart, and vasculature prepare the cardiovascular system for optimal function during these anticipated behavioral cycles. Cardiovascular circadian rhythms, however, may be a double-edged sword. The normal amplified responses in the morning may aid the transition from sleep to activity, but such exaggerated responses are potentially perilous in individuals susceptible to adverse cardiovascular events. Indeed, the occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death all have daily patterns, striking most frequently in the morning. Furthermore, chronic disruptions of the circadian clock, as with night-shift work, contribute to increased cardiovascular risk. Here we highlight the importance of the circadian system to normal cardiovascular function and to cardiovascular disease, and identify opportunities for optimizing timing of medications in cardiovascular disease.",

        "Abstract": "Brachytherapy (BT), the use of a locally placed or implanted radioactive source for treatment of an adjacent tumor, is an important component in the treatment of patients with both early- and advanced-stage cervical cancer and is increasingly part of the standard treatment protocol. When it is feasible, many radiation oncologists choose to include a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examination for planning BT treatment (ie, an MR imaging examination after placement of the applicator but before radiation dosing). MR imaging provides excellent soft-tissue contrast and allows radiation oncologists to individualize the radiation dose to the target volume and minimize the dose to adjacent organs that are at risk for radiation damage. However, traditionally, the radiology department has not performed imaging studies for planning, and the requirements are different compared with those of standard diagnostic imaging. In addition, many applicators are available for use in BT treatment of cervical cancer, and each must considered separately to determine MR safety and to define the best imaging parameters. Starting and supporting a robust gynecologic BT program includes implementing imaging protocols that are helpful to both radiation oncologists and diagnostic radiologists. By becoming more familiar with this treatment modality and the logistics of imaging patients undergoing BT, radiologists can provide imaging support for colleagues in the radiation oncology department and better care for patients.

We investigated how prior exposure to clinical trials and incentives were associated with likelihood of participation in a vaccine clinical trial through a questionnaire administered to 200 elderly patients in an academic general internal medicine clinic. Wilcoxon signed rank sum test compared likelihood of participation with and without monetary incentives. Logistic regression evaluated characteristics associated with intent to participate in an influenza vaccine trial, adjusted for age, gender, language, and education history. When asked about likelihood of participation if there was monetary compensation, there was a 12.2% absolute increase in those reporting that they would ",

        "Abstract": "While coronary artery calcium (CAC) has been extensively validated for predicting clinical events, most outcome studies of CAC have evaluated coronary heart disease (CHD) rather than atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events (including stroke). Also, virtually all CAC studies are of short- or intermediate-term follow-up, so studies across multi-ethnic cohorts with long-term follow-up are warranted prior to widespread clinical use. We sought to evaluate the contribution of CAC using the population-based MESA cohort with over 10\u2009years of follow-up for ASCVD events, and whether the association of CAC with events varied by sex, race/ethnicity, or age category.",

        "Abstract": "Limited information exists on the longitudinal association between the left ventricular (LV) structure and function and future cognitive impairment and dementia in a large population without clinically recognized cardiovascular disease at baseline. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between cardiac structure and function and risk of dementia and cognitive impairment in the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) cohort. Measures of LV structure and function were determined using magnetic resonance imaging at baseline in 4999 participants free of clinically diagnosed cardiovascular disease and dementia. Probable incident clinical dementia was ascertained from hospitalization discharge records. Cognitive function was evaluated using tests addressing global cognitive function, processing speed, and memory. Associations of measures of LV structure and function with the incidence of clinically diagnosed dementia and cognitive performance were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard regression models adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and cardiovascular events. During a median follow-up of 12 years, 130 probable incident dementia cases were documented. Higher LV mass index (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.02) and LV mass-to-volume ratio (hazard ratio, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-4.43) were independently associated with incident dementia and impaired cognitive function. Measures of LV function were not associated with risk of dementia or cognitive impairment. In conclusion, in a multiethnic cohort of participants without clinically detected cardiovascular disease and dementia at baseline, LV hypertrophy and concentric remodeling were independently associated with incident dementia and cognitive impairment.",

        "Abstract": "Respiration-induced tumor motion is a major obstacle for achieving high-precision radiotherapy of cancers in the thoracic and abdominal regions. Surrogate-based estimation and tracking methods are commonly used in radiotherapy, but with limited understanding of quantified correlation to tumor motion. In this study, we propose a method to simultaneously track the lung tumor and external surrogates to evaluate their spatial correlation in a quantitative way using dynamic MRI, which allows real-time acquisition without ionizing radiation exposure. To capture the lung and whole tumor, four MRI-compatible fiducials are placed on the patient's chest and upper abdomen. Two different types of acquisitions are performed in the sagittal orientation including multi-slice 2D cine MRIs to reconstruct 4D-MRI and two-slice 2D cine MRIs to simultaneously track the tumor and fiducials. A phase-binned 4D-MRI is first reconstructed from multi-slice MR images using body area as a respiratory surrogate and groupwise registration. The 4D-MRI provides 3D template volumes for different breathing phases. 3D tumor position is calculated by 3D-2D template matching in which 3D tumor templates in the 4D-MRI reconstruction and the 2D cine MRIs from the two-slice tracking dataset are registered. 3D trajectories of the external surrogates are derived via matching a 3D geometrical model of the fiducials to their segmentations on the 2D cine MRIs. We tested our method on ten lung cancer patients. Using a correlation analysis, the 3D tumor trajectory demonstrates a noticeable phase mismatch and significant cycle-to-cycle motion variation, while the external surrogate was not sensitive enough to capture such variations. Additionally, there was significant phase mismatch between surrogate signals obtained from the fiducials at different locations.",

        "Abstract": "Adequate sleep timed appropriately during the circadian night is important for numerous biological processes and systems. New evidence suggests that both sleep timing and duration may be important for optimal bone health as well. This review examines the diurnal variation of bone turnover markers (BTMs) and the importance of circadian clock genes in regulating bone mass. In addition, this review explores the evidence for a link between shift work (and its associated disturbances in sleep duration/quality and circadian alignment) and alterations in bone metabolism and bone health. Finally, we review how commonly used medications and over-the-counter substances (e.g. caffeine, melatonin) complicate the relationship between sleep and circadian disorders and bone health.",

        "Title": "Influenza Vaccination Beliefs and Practices in Elderly Primary Care Patients.",
        "Abstract": "The majority of influenza related deaths and hospitalizations occur among individuals \u226565\u00a0years, yet the national influenza vaccination rate for this group is 63% and is lower in the Hispanic population. Previous studies have described negative predictors of vaccination; however, there is a knowledge gap of how influenza vaccine-specific beliefs affect vaccination rates. We examined the relationship between influenza vaccine health beliefs and vaccination behaviors in a cross sectional sample of 200 primarily Hispanic patients aged \u226565\u00a0years in an academic general internal medicine clinic. Participants were asked about perceptions of influenza vaccine effectiveness and safety. Interview responses regarding influenza vaccine concerns were evaluated qualitatively with conventional content analysis. Logistic regression evaluated associations between beliefs and self-reported vaccination the previous year, adjusted for age, gender, and language. Of those approached to complete the questionnaire, 88% participated. Self-reported influenza vaccination rate during the study year was 75%. Only 46.5% endorsed the belief that influenza vaccine is very effective and 47% that it is very safe. Many stated specific concerns about flu vaccine including that it causes side effects/adverse outcomes, is not effective, vaccine components are harmful, and vaccination is not necessary. Belief that the flu shot causes the flu and concern for variability of the flu shot were associated with reduced odds of vaccination (aOR 0.19, 95% CI [0.05, 0.83] and 0.06 [0.006, 0.63] respectively). The patient-perceived distinction between cold, flu, and other symptoms warrants further exploration. This information can be used to develop targeted communication to promote vaccination.",

        "Title": "Evaluation of lung tumor motion management in radiation therapy with dynamic MRI.",
        "Abstract": "Surrogate-based tumor motion estimation and tracing methods are commonly used in radiotherapy despite the lack of continuous real time 3D tumor and surrogate data. In this study, we propose a method to simultaneously track the tumor and external surrogates with dynamic MRI, which allows us to evaluate their reproducible correlation. Four MRI-compatible fiducials are placed on the patient's chest and upper abdomen, and multi-slice 2D cine MRIs are acquired to capture the lung and whole tumor, followed by two-slice 2D cine MRIs to simultaneously track the tumor and fiducials, all in sagittal orientation. A phase-binned 4D-MRI is first reconstructed from multi-slice MR images using body area as a respiratory surrogate and group-wise registration. The 4D-MRI provides 3D template volumes for different breathing phases. 3D tumor position is calculated by 3D-2D template matching in which 3D tumor templates in 4D-MRI reconstruction and the 2D cine MRIs from the two-slice tracking dataset are registered. 3D trajectories of the external surrogates are derived via matching a 3D geometrical model to the fiducial segmentations on the 2D cine MRIs. We tested our method on five lung cancer patients. Internal target volume from 4D-CT showed average sensitivity of 86.5% compared to the actual tumor motion for 5 min. 3D tumor motion correlated with the external surrogate signal, but showed a noticeable phase mismatch. The 3D tumor trajectory showed significant cycle-to-cycle variation, while the external surrogate was not sensitive enough to capture such variations. Additionally, there was significant phase mismatch between surrogate signals obtained from fiducials at different locations.",

Incorporating MRI into the workflow of a department can be a major challenge when initiating an MRI-based brachytherapy program. This project aims to describe the goals, challenges, and solutions when initiating an MRI-based cervical cancer brachytherapy program at our institution.",

In cross-sectional analyses, each SD decrement in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was associated with a 2.12% HAA increment (95% CI 1.44% to 2.79%), a 3.53% MMP-7 increment (95% CI 0.93% to 6.07%) and a 6.37% SP-A increment (95% CI 1.35% to 11.13%), independent of demographics, smoking and inflammatory biomarkers. These findings support a novel hypothesis that HDL-C might influence subclinical lung injury and extracellular matrix remodelling.",

        "Title": "Progression of Carotid Arterial Stiffness With Treatment of Hypertension Over 10 Years: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.",
        "Abstract": "Associations with antihypertensive medication classes and progression of arterial stiffness have not been studied in a prospective multiethnic cohort. All participants had hypertension at baseline, defined as blood pressure \u2265140/90 mm\u2009Hg or use of antihypertensive medications. Medication use and blood pressure were assessed at 5 time points. Young's elastic modulus and distensibility coefficient of the right common carotid artery were obtained by ultrasound at baseline and after a mean (SD) follow-up period of 9.4 (0.5) years. Associations with changes in Young's elastic modulus and distensibility coefficient, baseline antihypertensive medication use, number of visits each medication class was reported, and blood pressure control (<140/90 mm\u2009Hg) were assessed using multiple linear regression models. At baseline, mean age of participants (n=1206) was 63.2 (9.0) years (55% female; 35% African American, 19% Hispanic, 12% Chinese). Mean systolic blood pressure was 136.5 (20.6) mm\u2009Hg. Greater progression of arterial stiffness was associated with older age, African American ethnicity, and baseline calcium channel blocker use. There were no other associations between changes in Young's elastic modulus or distensibility coefficient and use of other medication classes (all P>0.4). Achieving blood pressure control (<140/90 mm\u2009Hg) at all visits was associated with slower progression of arterial stiffness (Young's elastic modulus: \u03b2=-790.1 mm\u2009Hg, P=0.01; distensibility coefficient: \u03b2=7.34\u00d710",

        "Abstract": "Nutcracker syndrome is characterized by abnormal acute angulation of the superior mesenteric artery origin from the aorta, with resulting compression and hypertension of the crossing left renal vein. The radiologic studies used in diagnosis are typically limited to standard cross-sectional anatomic imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, with occasional use of Doppler ultrasound imaging for hemodynamic quantification. The standard for acquiring anatomic and physiologic information continues to be invasive venography. We describe the successful novel application of phase-encoded magnetic resonance imaging as a noninvasive method for acquiring anatomic and hemodynamic data in a case of possible nutcracker syndrome in a young patient.",

        "Abstract": "Cross-sectional studies show that activity fluctuations in healthy young adults possess robust temporal correlations that become altered with aging, and in dementia and depression. This study was designed to test whether or not within-subject changes of activity correlations (i) track the clinical progression of dementia, (ii) reflect the alterations of depression symptoms in patients with dementia, and (iii) can be manipulated by clinical interventions aimed at stabilizing circadian rhythmicity and improving sleep in dementia, namely timed bright light therapy and melatonin supplementation. We examined 144 patients with dementia (70-96 years old) who were assigned to daily treatment with bright light, bedtime melatonin, both or placebos only in a 3.5-year double-blinded randomized clinical trial. We found that activity correlations at temporal scales <~2\u2009hours significantly decreased over time and that light treatment attenuated the decrease by ~73%. Moreover, the decrease of temporal activity correlations positively correlated with the degrees of cognitive decline and worsening of mood though the associations were relatively weak. These results suggest a mechanistic link between multiscale activity regulation and circadian/sleep function in dementia patients. Whether temporal activity patterns allow unobtrusive, long-term monitoring of dementia progression and mood changes is worth further investigation.",

The sample was aged 45-84 years (mean = 59 years) and free of clinical cardiovascular disease and hypertension at baseline. Of the participants, 51% were female, 44% white, 23% Hispanic, 21% black, and 13% Chinese-American; 39% of participants developed hypertension during an average of 7.2 years of follow-up. Cox models were used to estimate associations of time-varying cumulative average neighborhood features (survey-based healthy food availability, walking environment, social cohesion, safety, and geographic information system-based density of favorable food stores and recreational resources) with incident hypertension. After adjustment for individual and neighborhood-level covariates, a 1-standard-deviation increase in healthy food availability was associated with a 12% lower rate of hypertension (hazard ratio = 0.88, 95% confidence interval: 0.82, 0.95). Other neighborhood features were not related to incidence of hypertension. The neighborhood food environment is related to the risk of hypertension.",

        "Abstract": "The sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) is highly heritable in humans and yet little is known about the genetic basis of inter-individual differences in sleep architecture. The aim of this study was to identify associations between candidate circadian gene variants and the polysomnogram, recorded under highly controlled laboratory conditions during a baseline, overnight, 8 h sleep opportunity. A candidate gene approach was employed to analyze single-nucleotide polymorphisms from five circadian-related genes in a two-phase analysis of 84 healthy young adults (28 F; 23.21 \u00b1 2.97 years) of European ancestry. A common variant in Period2 (PER2) was associated with 20 min less slow-wave sleep (SWS) in carriers of the minor allele than in noncarriers, representing a 22% reduction in SWS duration. Moreover, spectral analysis in a subset of participants (n = 37) showed the same PER2 polymorphism was associated with reduced EEG power density in the low delta range (0.25-1.0 Hz) during non-REM sleep and lower slow-wave activity (0.75-4.5 Hz) in the early part of the sleep episode. These results indicate the involvement of PER2 in the homeostatic process of sleep. Additionally, a rare variant in Melatonin Receptor 1B was associated with longer REM sleep latency, with minor allele carriers exhibiting an average of 65 min (87%) longer latency from sleep onset to REM sleep, compared to noncarriers. These findings suggest that circadian-related genes can modulate sleep architecture and the sleep EEG, including specific parameters previously implicated in the homeostatic regulation of sleep.",

        "Abstract": "Depression, chronic stress, and low levels of social support have known associations with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Physical activity has been shown to promote psychological health, reduce the frequency of depressive symptoms, and is associated with fewer cardiovascular events in depressed subjects with known CVD. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that physical activity attenuates the association between psychosocial factors and incident CVD. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cohort includes 6,814 participants free of clinical CVD at baseline. Complete data on physical activity were available for 6,795 subjects (mean age 62\u00a0years; 47% men). Psychosocial factors were assessed using standardized questionnaires. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the association between psychosocial factors and CVD events and its modulation by physical activity. In models adjusted for age, gender, and race/ethnicity, both depression and chronic burden were associated with CVD events (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0= 1.38 [1.04 to 1.84], p\u00a0= 0.028 for depression; HR\u00a0= 1.15 [1.05 to 1.24], p\u00a0= 0.001 for chronic burden). Adjusting for physical activity, the relation between depression, chronic burden, and CVD events was not significantly reduced (HR\u00a0= 1.35 [1.02 to 1.80], p\u00a0= 0.039 for depression; HR\u00a0= 1.14 [1.05 to 1.23], p\u00a0= 0.001 for chronic burden). Although physical activity is an important component of physical and psychological health\u00a0and well-being, it did not significantly attenuate the strong relation between depression or\u00a0chronic burden and incident CVD.",

        "Title": "Impact of Common Diabetes Risk Variant in MTNR1B on Sleep, Circadian, and Melatonin Physiology.",
        "Abstract": "The risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increased by abnormalities in sleep quantity and quality, circadian alignment, and melatonin regulation. A common genetic variant in a receptor for the circadian-regulated hormone melatonin (MTNR1B) is associated with increased fasting blood glucose and risk of T2D, but whether sleep or circadian disruption mediates this risk is unknown. We aimed to test if MTNR1B diabetes risk variant rs10830963 associates with measures of sleep or circadian physiology in intensive in-laboratory protocols (n = 58-96) or cross-sectional studies with sleep quantity and quality and timing measures from self-report (n = 4,307-10,332), actigraphy (n = 1,513), or polysomnography (n = 3,021). In the in-laboratory studies, we found a significant association with a substantially longer duration of elevated melatonin levels (41 min) and delayed circadian phase of dim-light melatonin offset (1.37 h), partially mediated through delayed offset of melatonin synthesis. Furthermore, increased T2D risk in MTNR1B risk allele carriers was more pronounced in early risers versus late risers as determined by 7 days of actigraphy. Our results provide the surprising insight that the MTNR1B risk allele influences dynamics of melatonin secretion, generating a novel hypothesis that the MTNR1B risk allele may extend the duration of endogenous melatonin production later into the morning and that early waking may magnify the diabetes risk conferred by the risk allele.",

        "Abstract": "Tobacco smoke contains numerous agonists of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway, and activation of the AhR pathway was shown to promote atherosclerosis in mice. Intriguingly, cigarette smoking is most strongly and robustly associated with DNA modifications to an AhR pathway gene, the AhR repressor (AHRR). We hypothesized that altered AHRR methylation in monocytes, a cell type sensitive to cigarette smoking and involved in atherogenesis, may be a part of the biological link between cigarette smoking and atherosclerosis.",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies demonstrate associations of low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations with low bone mineral density (BMD) and fractures, motivating widespread use of vitamin D supplements for bone health. However, previous studies have been limited to predominantly White populations despite differences in the distribution and metabolism of 25(OH)D by race/ethnicity. We determined associations of serum 25(OH)D, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (24,25(OH2)D3), and parathyroid hormone (PTH) with BMD among 1773 adult participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) in a staggered cross-sectional study design. Vitamin D metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy and PTH using a 2-site immunoassay from serum collected in 2000-2002. Volumetric trabecular lumbar BMD was measured from computed tomography scans performed in 2002-2005 expressed as g/cm(3). We used linear regression and graphical methods to compare associations of vitamin D metabolite and PTH concentrations with BMD as the outcomes measure among White (n=714), Black (n=353), Chinese (n=249), and Hispanic (n=457) participants. Serum 25(OH)D and 24,25(OH2)D3 concentrations were highest among Whites and lowest among Blacks. BMD was greatest among Black participants. Higher serum 25(OH)D was only associated with higher BMD among Whites and Chinese participants (P-for-interaction=0.054). Comparing the lowest category of 25(OH)D (<20 ng/ml) to the highest (\u226530 ng/ml), the adjusted mean difference in BMD was -8.1g/cm3 (95% CI -14.8, -1.4) for Whites; -10.2g/cm3 (-20.4, 0.0) for Chinese vs. 8.8 g/cm3 (-2.8, 20.5) for Black and -1.1g/cm3 (-8.3, 6.2) for Hispanic. Similar results were observed for serum 24,25(OH2)D3. Serum PTH was not associated with BMD. In a multi-ethnic population, associations of 25(OH)D with BMD were strongest among White and Chinese participants and null among Black and Hispanic participants. Further studies are needed to determine optimal biomarkers for bone health for multiple ethnic groups.",

        "Title": "Endogenous circadian system and circadian misalignment impact glucose tolerance via separate mechanisms in humans.",
        "Abstract": "Glucose tolerance is lower in the evening and at night than in the morning. However, the relative contribution of the circadian system vs. the behavioral cycle (including the sleep/wake and fasting/feeding cycles) is unclear. Furthermore, although shift work is a diabetes risk factor, the separate impact on glucose tolerance of the behavioral cycle, circadian phase, and circadian disruption (i.e., misalignment between the central circadian pacemaker and the behavioral cycle) has not been systematically studied. Here we show--by using two 8-d laboratory protocols--in healthy adults that the circadian system and circadian misalignment have distinct influences on glucose tolerance, both separate from the behavioral cycle. First, postprandial glucose was 17% higher (i.e., lower glucose tolerance) in the biological evening (8:00 PM) than morning (8:00 AM; i.e., a circadian phase effect), independent of the behavioral cycle effect. Second, circadian misalignment itself (12-h behavioral cycle inversion) increased postprandial glucose by 6%. Third, these variations in glucose tolerance appeared to be explained, at least in part, by different mechanisms: during the biological evening by decreased pancreatic \u03b2-cell function (27% lower early-phase insulin) and during circadian misalignment presumably by decreased insulin sensitivity (elevated postprandial glucose despite 14% higher late-phase insulin) without change in early-phase insulin. We explored possible contributing factors, including changes in polysomnographic sleep and 24-h hormonal profiles. We demonstrate that the circadian system importantly contributes to the reduced glucose tolerance observed in the evening compared with the morning. Separately, circadian misalignment reduces glucose tolerance, providing a mechanism to help explain the increased diabetes risk in shift workers.",

        "Abstract": "This randomized controlled trial assessed different educational approaches for increasing colorectal cancer screening uptake in a sample of primarily non-US born urban minority individuals, over aged 50, with health insurance, and out of compliance with screening guidelines. In one group, participants were mailed printed educational material (n = 180); in a second, participants' primary care physicians received academic detailing to improve screening referral and follow-up practices (n = 185); in a third, physicians received academic detailing and participants received tailored telephone education (n = 199). Overall, 21.5% of participants (n = 121) received appropriate screening within one year of randomization. There were no statistically significant pairwise differences between groups in screening rate. Among those 60 years of age or older, however, the detailing plus telephone education group had a higher screening rate than the print group (27.3 vs. 7.7%, p = .02). Different kinds of interventions will be required to increase colorectal cancer screening among the increasingly small population segment that remains unscreened.

OSA, the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing, has been linked to multiple cardiovascular, metabolic, hormonal, and inflammatory derangements and may have adverse effects on bone. However, little is known about how OSA (including the associated hypoxia and sleep loss) affects bone metabolism. In order to gain insight into the relationship between sleep and bone, we review the growing information on OSA and metabolic bone disease and discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms by which OSA may affect bone metabolism/architecture.",

        "Abstract": "Various aspects of immune response exhibit 24-h variations suggesting that infection susceptibility and treatment efficacy may vary by time of day. Whether these 24-h variations are endogenous or evoked by changes in environmental or behavioral conditions is not known. We assessed the endogenous circadian control and environmental and behavioral influences on ex-vivo lipopolysaccharide stimulation of whole blood in thirteen healthy participants under 48h of baseline conditions with standard sleep-wake schedules and 40-50h of constant environmental and behavioral (constant routine; CR) conditions. Significant 24-h rhythms were observed under baseline conditions in Monocyte Chemotactic Protein, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor and Interleukin 8 but not Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha whereas significant 24-h rhythms were observed in all four immune factors under CR conditions. The rhythm amplitudes, expressed as a percentage of mean, were comparable between immune factors and across conditions. In contrast, the acrophase time (time of the fitted peak) was different between immune factors, and included daytime and nighttime peaks and changes across behavioral conditions. These results suggest that the endogenous circadian system underpins the temporal organization of immune responses in humans with additional effects of external environmental and behavioral cycles. These findings have implications for understanding the adverse effects of recurrent circadian disruption and sleep curtailment on immune function.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that depression and anxiety are associated with electrocardiographic (ECG) repolarization abnormalities in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a cohort free of symptomatic cardiovascular disease. Depressive symptoms were assessed by using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and trait anxiety symptoms by using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; both were categorized according to uppermost quartile. T-wave inversions in ECG leads other than V1 to V3 were obtained from electrocardiograms obtained at rest during the baseline examination. Participants with major intraventricular conduction abnormalities and those taking antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, and/or antipsychotics were excluded. Logistic regression models were estimated with multivariable adjustment for traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors. Among 5,906 participants, elevated depressive symptoms were associated with increased odds of T-wave inversion after multivariable adjustment (odds ratio 2.02, 95% confidence interval 1.33 to 3.06, p = 0.001), whereas greater trait anxiety was associated with reduced odds of T-wave inversion (odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.29 to 0.77, p = 0.003). The divergent associations of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety with ECG T-wave inversions were similar in men and women, and these associations were present across the racial and ethnic subgroups (non-Hispanic white, African-American, Hispanic, and Chinese). In conclusion, symptoms of depression and anxiety were independently yet oppositely associated with ECG T-wave inversions. Negative emotions may have a differential impact on cardiovascular mortality through unique relations with cardiac repolarization.",

Here we report potentially functional age-dMS, defined as age- and cis-gene expression-associated methylation sites (age-eMS), identified by integrating genome-wide CpG methylation and gene expression profiles collected ex vivo from circulating T cells (227 CD4+ samples) and monocytes (1,264 CD14+ samples, age range: 55-94 years). None of the age-eMS detected in 227 T-cell samples are detectable in 1,264 monocyte samples, in contrast to the majority of age-dMS detected in T cells that replicated in monocytes. Age-eMS tend to be hypomethylated with older age, located in predicted enhancers and preferentially linked to expression of antigen processing and presentation genes. These results identify and characterize potentially functional age-related methylation in human T cells and monocytes, and provide novel insights into the role age-dMS may have in the aging process.",

Quality indicators are widely employed to monitor operator performance and to gauge colonoscopy effectiveness. Some have suggested that the enumeration of the mean number of adenomas per colonoscopy (MNA) may be a more useful measure of bowel preparation quality, but evidence of the utility of this metric is limited.

        "Abstract": "Although a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of 0 is associated with a very low 10-year risk for cardiac events, this risk is nonzero. Subjects with a family history of coronary heart disease (CHD) has been associated with more subclinical atherosclerosis than subjects without a family history of CHD. The purpose of this study was to assess the significance of a family history for CHD in subjects with a CAC score of 0. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cohort includes 6,814 participants free of clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline. Positive family history was defined as reporting a parent, sibling, or child who had a heart attack. Time to incident CHD or CVD event was modeled using the multivariable Cox regression; 3,185 subjects were identified from the original Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cohort as having a baseline CAC score of 0 (mean age 58 years, 37% men). Over a median follow-up of 10 years, 101 participants (3.2%) had CVD events and 56 (1.8%) had CHD events. In age- and gender-adjusted analyses, a family history of CHD was associated with an \u223c70% increase in CVD (hazard ratio 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 2.56) and CHD (hazard ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 2.91) events. CVD events remained significant after further adjustment for ethnicity, risk factors, and baseline medication use. In conclusion, asymptomatic subjects with a 0 CAC score and a positive family history of CHD are at increased risk for CVD and CHD events compared with those without a family history of CHD, although absolute event rates remain low.",

        "Abstract": "The association of longitudinal changes in left ventricular (LV) structure and function with myocardial fibrosis is unclear. We relate temporal changes in body size-indexed LV mass (LVMi) and end-diastolic volume indexed to body surface area, LV mass-to-volume ratio, and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) from cine cardiac magnetic resonance for 10 years, with replacement scar assessed from late gadolinium enhancement, and lower postcontrast T1 times reflecting greater diffuse myocardial fibrosis measured at the end of the follow-up period. All participants (n=1813) who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance twice as part of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis 10 years apart were included. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors measured the association of 10-year changes in LV structure and function, with fibrosis measured at follow-up. The presence of LV scar at year 10 was cross-sectionally associated with higher LVMi (\u224810 g/m(2)), higher mass-to-volume ratio (0.1-0.2 g/mL), but lower LVEF (\u22484%) and longitudinally with 3% decrease in LVEF and 0.7% greater end-diastolic volume indexed to body surface area in men for 10 years. Lower postcontrast T1 times at year 10 were associated cross-sectionally with lower LVMi (r=0.33), end-diastolic volume indexed to body surface area (r=0.25), and LVEF (in men only: r=0.14) and longitudinally with a decrease in LVMi (r=0.20) and reduction in LVEF (in men only: r=0.15). Sustained hypertension for 10 years was associated with increased LVMi and higher diffuse and replacement fibrosis at follow-up. During a 10-year period, increased concentric hypertrophy in women and LV dilatation in men were associated with replacement fibrosis, whereas decreasing LVMi was associated with diffuse fibrosis. Hypertension-induced remodeling was related to enhanced replacement and diffuse fibrosis, as well as hypertrophy.",

        "Title": "Simulated shift work in rats perturbs multiscale regulation of locomotor activity.",
        "Abstract": "Motor activity possesses a multiscale regulation that is characterized by fractal activity fluctuations with similar structure across a wide range of timescales spanning minutes to hours. Fractal activity patterns are disturbed in animals after ablating the master circadian pacemaker (suprachiasmatic nucleus, SCN) and in humans with SCN dysfunction as occurs with aging and in dementia, suggesting the crucial role of the circadian system in the multiscale activity regulation. We hypothesized that the normal synchronization between behavioural cycles and the SCN-generated circadian rhythms is required for multiscale activity regulation. To test the hypothesis, we studied activity fluctuations of rats in a simulated shift work protocol that was designed to force animals to be active during the habitual resting phase of the circadian/daily cycle. We found that these animals had gradually decreased mean activity level and reduced 24-h activity rhythm amplitude, indicating disturbed circadian and behavioural cycles. Moreover, these animals had disrupted fractal activity patterns as characterized by more random activity fluctuations at multiple timescales from 4 to 12 h. Intriguingly, these activity disturbances exacerbated when the shift work schedule lasted longer and persisted even in the normal days (without forced activity) following the shift work. The disrupted circadian and fractal patterns resemble those of SCN-lesioned animals and of human patients with dementia, suggesting a detrimental impact of shift work on multiscale activity regulation.",

        "Title": "Using C-arm x-ray imaging to guide local reporter probe delivery for tracking stem cell engraftment.",
        "Abstract": "Poor cell survival and difficulties with visualization of cell delivery are major problems with current cell transplantation methods. To protect cells from early destruction, microencapsulation methods have been developed. The addition of a contrast agent to the microcapsule also could enable tracking by MR, ultrasound, and X-ray imaging. However, determining the cell viability within the microcapsule still remains an issue. Reporter gene imaging provides a way to determine cell viability, but delivery of the reporter probe by systemic injection may be hindered in ischemic diseases. In the present study, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were transfected with triple fusion reporter gene containing red fluorescent protein, truncated thymidine kinase (SPECT/PET reporter) and firefly luciferase (bioluminescence reporter). Transfected cells were microencapsulated in either unlabeled or perfluorooctylbromide (PFOB) impregnated alginate. The addition of PFOB provided radiopacity to enable visualization of the microcapsules by X-ray imaging. Before intramuscular transplantation in rabbit thigh muscle, the microcapsules were incubated with D-luciferin, and bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was performed immediately. Twenty-four and forty-eight hours post transplantation, c-arm CT was used to target the luciferin to the X-ray-visible microcapsules for BLI cell viability assessment, rather than systemic reporter probe injections. Not only was the bioluminescent signal emission from the PFOB-encapsulated MSCs confirmed as compared to non-encapsulated, naked MSCs, but over 90% of injection sites of PFOB-encapsulated MSCs were visible on c-arm CT. The latter aided in successful targeting of the reporter probe to injection sites using conventional X-ray imaging to determine cell viability at 1-2 days post transplantation. Blind luciferin injections to the approximate location of unlabeled microcapsules resulted in successful BLI signal detection in only 18% of injections. In conclusion, reporter gene probes can be more precisely targeted using c-arm CT for in vivo transplant viability assessment, thereby avoiding large and costly systemic injections of a reporter probe.",

It [IPC?] is a briefer, more structured version for use primarily in non-mental health settings, such as primary care clinics when treating patients with symptoms of depression. National health-care reform, which will bring previously uninsured persons into care and provide mechanisms to support mental health training of primary care providers, will increase interest in briefer psychotherapy. This paper describes the rationale, development, evidence for efficacy, and basic structure of IPC and also presents an illustrated clinical vignette. The evidence suggests that IPC is efficacious in reducing symptoms of depression; that it can be used by mental health personnel of different levels of training, and that the number of sessions is flexible depending on the context and resources. More clinical trials are needed, especially ones comparing IPC to other types of care used in the delivery of mental health services in primary care.",

        "Title": "Assessing risk prediction models using individual participant data from multiple studies.",
        "Abstract": "Individual participant time-to-event data from multiple prospective epidemiologic studies enable detailed investigation into the predictive ability of risk models. Here we address the challenges in appropriately combining such information across studies. Methods are exemplified by analyses of log C-reactive protein and conventional risk factors for coronary heart disease in the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration, a collation of individual data from multiple prospective studies with an average follow-up duration of 9.8 years (dates varied). We derive risk prediction models using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis stratified by study and obtain estimates of risk discrimination, Harrell's concordance index, and Royston's discrimination measure within each study; we then combine the estimates across studies using a weighted meta-analysis. Various weighting approaches are compared and lead us to recommend using the number of events in each study. We also discuss the calculation of measures of reclassification for multiple studies. We further show that comparison of differences in predictive ability across subgroups should be based only on within-study information and that combining measures of risk discrimination from case-control studies and prospective studies is problematic. The concordance index and discrimination measure gave qualitatively similar results throughout. While the concordance index was very heterogeneous between studies, principally because of differing age ranges, the increments in the concordance index from adding log C-reactive protein to conventional risk factors were more homogeneous.",

        "Abstract": "Due to the high sensitivity of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to physiological motion, clinical DTI scans often suffer a significant amount of artifacts. Tensor-fitting-based, post-processing outlier rejection is often used to reduce the influence of motion artifacts. Although it is an effective approach, when there are multiple corrupted data, this method may no longer correctly identify and reject the corrupted data. In this paper, we introduce a new criterion called \"corrected Inter-Slice Intensity Discontinuity\" (cISID) to detect motion-induced artifacts. We compared the performance of algorithms using cISID and other existing methods with regard to artifact detection. The experimental results show that the integration of cISID into fitting-based methods significantly improves the retrospective detection performance at post-processing analysis. The performance of the cISID criterion, if used alone, was inferior to the fitting-based methods, but cISID could effectively identify severely corrupted images with a rapid calculation time. In the second part of this paper, an outlier rejection scheme was implemented on a scanner for real-time monitoring of image quality and reacquisition of the corrupted data. The real-time monitoring, based on cISID and followed by post-processing, fitting-based outlier rejection, could provide a robust environment for routine DTI studies.",

        "Abstract": "Serious adverse cardiovascular events peak in the morning, possibly related to increased thrombosis in critical vessels. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which inhibits fibrinolysis, is a key circulating prothrombotic factor that rises in the morning in humans. We tested whether this morning peak in PAI-1 is caused by the internal circadian system or by behaviors that typically occur in the morning, such as altered posture and physical activity. Twelve healthy adults underwent a 2-week protocol that enabled the distinction of endogenous circadian effects from behavioral and environmental effects. The results demonstrated a robust circadian rhythm in circulating PAI-1 with a peak corresponding to \u223c6:30 am. This rhythm in PAI-1 was 8-times larger than changes in PAI-1 induced by standardized behavioral stressors, including head-up tilt and 15-minute cycle exercise. If this large endogenous morning peak in PAI-1 persists in vulnerable individuals, it could help explain the morning peak in adverse cardiovascular events.",

        "Abstract": "DNA methylation is one of several epigenetic mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of gene expression; however, the extent to which methylation of CpG dinucleotides correlates with gene expression at the genome-wide level is still largely unknown. Using purified primary monocytes from subjects in a large community-based cohort (n = 1264), we characterized methylation (>485 000 CpG sites) and mRNA expression (>48K transcripts) and carried out genome-wide association analyses of 8370 expression phenotypes. We identified 11 203 potential cis-acting CpG loci whose degree of methylation was associated with gene expression (eMS) at a false discovery rate threshold of 0.001. Most of the associations were consistent in effect size and direction of effect across sex and three ethnicities. Contrary to expectation, these eMS were not predominately enriched in promoter regions, or CpG islands, but rather in the 3' UTR, gene bodies, CpG shores or 'offshore' sites, and both positive and negative correlations between methylation and expression were observed across all locations. eMS were enriched for regions predicted to be regulatory by ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) data in multiple cell types, particularly enhancers. One of the strongest association signals detected (P < 2.2 \u00d7 10(-308)) was a methylation probe (cg17005068) in the promoter/enhancer region of the glutathione S-transferase theta 1 gene (GSTT1, encoding the detoxification enzyme) with GSTT1 mRNA expression. Our study provides a detailed description of the epigenetic architecture in human monocytes and its relationship to gene expression. These data may help prioritize interrogation of biologically relevant methylation loci and provide new insights into the epigenetic basis of human health and diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Human motor activity has a robust, intrinsic fractal structure with similar patterns from minutes to hours. The fractal activity patterns appear to be physiologically important because the patterns persist under different environmental conditions but are significantly altered/reduced with aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we report that dementia patients, known to have disrupted circadian rhythmicity, also have disrupted fractal activity patterns and that the disruption is more pronounced in patients with more amyloid plaques (a marker of AD severity). Moreover, the degree of fractal activity disruption is strongly associated with vasopressinergic and neurotensinergic neurons (two major circadian neurotransmitters) in postmortem suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and can better predict changes of the two neurotransmitters than traditional circadian measures. These findings suggest that the SCN impacts human activity regulation at multiple time scales and that disrupted fractal activity may serve as a non-invasive biomarker of SCN neurodegeneration in dementia.",

In multivariable adjusted linear regression models with PR and each P-wave variable as a separate outcome, significant age, sex and race differences in these markers were observed. Subsequently, we report reference ranges for abnormal [2nd and 98th percentiles], borderline abnormal [5th and 95th percentiles] and mean [SD] values of PR and P-wave indices stratified by age [middle age (45-64 years) and seniors (65-84 years)], sex [men and women] and race [whites, African Americans, Hispanics and Chinese].",

        "Title": "The role of the circadian system in fractal neurophysiological control.",
        "Abstract": "Many neurophysiological variables such as heart rate, motor activity, and neural activity are known to exhibit intrinsic fractal fluctuations - similar temporal fluctuation patterns at different time scales. These fractal patterns contain information about health, as many pathological conditions are accompanied by their alteration or absence. In physical systems, such fluctuations are characteristic of critical states on the border between randomness and order, frequently arising from nonlinear feedback interactions between mechanisms operating on multiple scales. Thus, the existence of fractal fluctuations in physiology challenges traditional conceptions of health and disease, suggesting that high levels of integrity and adaptability are marked by complex variability, not constancy, and are properties of a neurophysiological network, not individual components. Despite the subject's theoretical and clinical interest, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying fractal regulation remain largely unknown. The recent discovery that the circadian pacemaker (suprachiasmatic nucleus) plays a crucial role in generating fractal patterns in motor activity and heart rate sheds an entirely new light on both fractal control networks and the function of this master circadian clock, and builds a bridge between the fields of circadian biology and fractal physiology. In this review, we sketch the emerging picture of the developing interdisciplinary field of fractal neurophysiology by examining the circadian system's role in fractal regulation.",

Pulmonary hyperinflation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may contribute to changes in intrathoracic pressure that increase LV wall stress. We therefore hypothesized that residual lung volume in COPD would be associated with greater LV mass.",

        "Abstract": "The magnitude of the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks was without precedent in the United States, but long-term longitudinal research on its health consequences for primary care patients is limited. We assessed the prevalence and exposure-related determinants of mental disorders, functioning, general medical conditions, and service utilization, 1 and 4 years after the 9/11 attacks, in an urban primary care cohort (N = 444) in Manhattan. Although the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and levels of functional impairment declined over time, a substantial increase in suicidal ideation and missed work was observed. Most medical outcomes and service utilization indicators demonstrated a short-term increase after the 9/11 attacks (mean change of +20.3%), followed by a minor decrease\u00a0in the subsequent year\u00a0(mean change of -3.2%). Loss of a close person was associated with the highest risk for poor mental health and functional status over time. These findings highlight the importance of longitudinal assessments of mental, functional, and medical outcomes in urban populations exposed to mass trauma and terrorism.",

        "Title": "Fractal patterns of neural activity exist within the suprachiasmatic nucleus and require extrinsic network interactions.",
        "Abstract": "The mammalian central circadian pacemaker (the suprachiasmatic nucleus, SCN) contains thousands of neurons that are coupled through a complex network of interactions. In addition to the established role of the SCN in generating rhythms of ~24 hours in many physiological functions, the SCN was recently shown to be necessary for normal self-similar/fractal organization of motor activity and heart rate over a wide range of time scales--from minutes to 24 hours. To test whether the neural network within the SCN is sufficient to generate such fractal patterns, we studied multi-unit neural activity of in vivo and in vitro SCNs in rodents. In vivo SCN-neural activity exhibited fractal patterns that are virtually identical in mice and rats and are similar to those in motor activity at time scales from minutes up to 10 hours. In addition, these patterns remained unchanged when the main afferent signal to the SCN, namely light, was removed. However, the fractal patterns of SCN-neural activity are not autonomous within the SCN as these patterns completely broke down in the isolated in vitro SCN despite persistence of circadian rhythmicity. Thus, SCN-neural activity is fractal in the intact organism and these fractal patterns require network interactions between the SCN and extra-SCN nodes. Such a fractal control network could underlie the fractal regulation observed in many physiological functions that involve the SCN, including motor control and heart rate regulation.",

        "Abstract": "In the United States alone, approximately 22 million people take beta-blockers chronically. These medications suppress endogenous nighttime melatonin secretion, which may explain a reported side effect of insomnia. Therefore, we tested whether nightly melatonin supplementation improves sleep in hypertensive patients treated with beta-blockers.",

Sleep deprivation contributes to a number of molecular, immune, and neural changes that play a role in disease development, independent of primary sleep disorders. These changes in biological processes in response to chronic sleep deficiency may serve as etiological factors for the development and exacerbation of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and, ultimately, a shortened lifespan. Sleep deprivation also results in significant impairments in cognitive and motor performance which increase the risk of motor vehicle crashes and work-related injuries and fatal accidents. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society have developed this statement to communicate to national health stakeholders the current knowledge which ties sufficient sleep and circadian alignment in adults to health.",

        "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies link short sleep duration and circadian disruption with higher risk of metabolic syndrome and diabetes. We tested the hypotheses that prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption, as can occur in people performing shift work, impairs glucose regulation and metabolism. Healthy adults spent >5 weeks under controlled laboratory conditions in which they experienced an initial baseline segment of optimal sleep, 3 weeks of sleep restriction (5.6 hours of sleep per 24 hours) combined with circadian disruption (recurring 28-hour \"days\"), followed by 9 days of recovery sleep with circadian re-entrainment. Exposure to prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption, with measurements taken at the same circadian phase, decreased the participants' resting metabolic rate and increased plasma glucose concentrations after a meal, an effect resulting from inadequate pancreatic insulin secretion. These parameters normalized during the 9 days of recovery sleep and stable circadian re-entrainment. Thus, in humans, prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption alters metabolism and could increase the risk of obesity and diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "Diurnal variation in nitrogen homeostasis is observed across phylogeny. But whether these are endogenous rhythms, and if so, molecular mechanisms that link nitrogen homeostasis to the circadian clock remain unknown. Here, we provide evidence that\u00a0a clock-dependent peripheral oscillator, Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 15 transcriptionally coordinates rhythmic expression of multiple enzymes involved in mammalian nitrogen homeostasis. In particular, Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 15-deficient mice exhibit no discernable amino acid rhythm, and the rhythmicity of ammonia to urea detoxification is impaired. Of the external cues, feeding plays a dominant role in modulating Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 15 rhythm and nitrogen homeostasis. Further, when all behavioral, environmental and dietary cues were controlled in humans, nitrogen homeostasis exhibited an endogenous circadian rhythmicity. Thus, in mammals, nitrogen homeostasis exhibits circadian rhythmicity, and is orchestrated by Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 15.",

        "Abstract": "Sudden cardiac death exhibits diurnal variation in both acquired and hereditary forms of heart disease, but the molecular basis of this variation is unknown. A common mechanism that underlies susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias is abnormalities in the duration (for example, short or long QT syndromes and heart failure) or pattern (for example, Brugada's syndrome) of myocardial repolarization. Here we provide molecular evidence that links circadian rhythms to vulnerability in ventricular arrhythmias in mice. Specifically, we show that cardiac ion-channel expression and QT-interval duration (an index of myocardial repolarization) exhibit endogenous circadian rhythmicity under the control of a clock-dependent oscillator, kr\u00fcppel-like factor 15 (Klf15). Klf15 transcriptionally controls rhythmic expression of Kv channel-interacting protein 2 (KChIP2), a critical subunit required for generating the transient outward potassium current. Deficiency or excess of Klf15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation, abnormal repolarization and enhanced susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias. These findings identify circadian transcription of ion channels as a mechanism for cardiac arrhythmogenesis.",

Such adverse cardiovascular events have day/night patterns with peaks in the morning (~9 AM), potentially related to endogenous circadian clock control of platelet activation. The objective was to test if the human endogenous circadian system influences (1) platelet function and (2) platelet response to standardized behavioral stressors. We also aimed to compare the magnitude of any effects on platelet function caused by the circadian system with that caused by varied standardized behavioral stressors, including mental arithmetic, passive postural tilt and mild cycling exercise.",

        "Abstract": "Whether the rate of kidney function decline before the onset of CKD differs among racial and ethnic groups remains unclear. Here, we evaluated kidney function decline and incident CKD among white, black, Hispanic, and Chinese participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) during 5 years of follow-up. We estimated GFR using both cystatin C (eGFRcys) and creatinine (eGFRcreat). The definition of incident CKD required eGFRcys <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and a decline in eGFRcys \u22651 ml/min per year. Among participants with eGFRcreat >60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) at baseline, blacks had a significantly higher rate of kidney function decline than whites (0.31 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)/yr faster on average, P=0.001), even after adjusting for multiple potential confounders. Among Hispanics, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans had faster rates of decline than whites (0.55 and 0.47 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)/yr faster, respectively). Mexicans, South Americans, or other Hispanics had similar rates of decline compared to whites. We did not detect significant differences in the rates of kidney function decline among Chinese and white participants. Among those with normal or near-normal kidney function at baseline, blacks and Hispanics had the highest rates of incident CKD during follow-up. Adjustment for comorbidities attenuated some of these differences. In conclusion, the average rate of kidney function decline before the onset of CKD differs among racial and ethnic groups. Traditional risk factors do not explain these differences fully, highlighting the need to explore these disparities.",

        "Title": "Ethnic differences in hypertension incidence among middle-aged and older adults: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis.",
        "Abstract": "The prevalence of hypertension is higher among blacks than whites. However, inconsistent findings have been reported on the incidence of hypertension among middle-aged and older blacks and whites, and limited data are available on the incidence of hypertension among Hispanics and Asians in the United States. Therefore, this study investigated the age-specific incidence of hypertension by ethnicity for 3146 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Participants, age 45 to 84 years at baseline, were followed for a median of 4.8 years for incident hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure \u2265140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure \u226590 mm Hg, or the initiation of antihypertensive medications. The crude incidence rate of hypertension, per 1000 person-years, was 56.8 for whites, 84.9 for blacks, 65.7 for Hispanics, and 52.2 for Chinese. After adjustment for age, sex, and study site, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for hypertension was increased for blacks age 45 to 54 (IRR: 2.05 [95%CI: 1.47 to 2.85]), 55 to 64 (IRR: 1.63 [95% CI: 1.20 to 2.23]), and 65 to 74 years (IRR: 1.67 [95% CI: 1.21 to 2.30]) compared with whites but not for those 75 to 84 years of age (IRR: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.56 to 1.66]). Additional adjustment for health characteristics attenuated these associations. Hispanic participants also had a higher incidence of hypertension compared with whites; however, hypertension incidence did not differ for Chinese and white participants. In summary, hypertension incidence was higher for blacks compared with whites between 45 and 74 years of age but not after age 75 years. Public health prevention programs tailored to middle-aged and older adults are needed to eliminate ethnic disparities in incident hypertension.",

        "Abstract": "Increased left ventricular (LV) mass and changes in LV geometry may precede hypertension onset. The authors examined the associations of LV mass and geometry, assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, with hypertension incidence in 2,567 normotensive participants enrolled in 2000-2002 in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, an ethnically diverse, population-based, US study. Over a median follow-up of 4.8 years, 745 (29%) participants developed hypertension. In a fully adjusted model including baseline blood pressure, the relative risks of incident hypertension from the lowest to highest LV mass quartile were 1.00 (referent), 1.13 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89, 1.43), 1.28 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.63), and 1.78 (95% CI: 1.38, 2.30) (P < 0.001 for linear trend). Higher levels of LV concentric geometry, defined by higher LV mass to end-diastolic volume quartiles, were associated with higher risk of incident hypertension in a fully adjusted model (P = 0.044 for linear trend). In a final model containing both quartiles of LV mass and LV mass/volume along with all covariates including baseline blood pressure, higher LV mass quartiles were associated with incident hypertension (P < 0.001 for linear trend), whereas higher LV mass/volume quartiles were not (P = 0.643 for linear trend). In this multiethnic cohort, alterations in LV mass preceded hypertension onset among normotensive individuals.",

This study helps address the gap in the literature by examining whether neighborhood characteristics are associated with cortisol profiles. Analyses were based on data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Stress study, which collected multiple measures of salivary cortisol over three days on a population based sample of approximately 800 adults. Multilevel models with splines were used to examine associations of cortisol levels with neighborhood poverty, violence, disorder, and social cohesion. Neighborhood violence was significantly associated with lower cortisol values at wakeup and with a slower decline in cortisol over the earlier part of the day, after sociodemographic controls. Associations were weaker and less consistent for neighborhood poverty, social cohesion, and disorder. Results revealed suggestive, though limited, evidence linking neighborhood contexts to cortisol circadian rhythms.",

        "Abstract": "Caring for persons with diabetes is expensive, and this burden is increasing. Little is known about service use, behaviors, and self-care of older individuals with diabetes who live in underserved communities. Information about self-care, informal care, and service utilization in urban (largely Latino, n = 695) and rural (mostly white, n = 819) Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes living in federally designated medically underserved areas was collected using computer-aided telephone interviews as part of the baseline assessment in the Informatics and Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) Project. Where items were comparable, service use was compared with that of a nationally representative group of Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes, using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Compared to nationally representative groups, the underserved groups reported worse general health but similar health care service use, with the exception of home care. However, compared to the underserved rural group, the underserved, largely minority urban group, reported worse general health (P < 0.0001); more inpatient nights (P = 0.003), emergency room visits (P < 0.001), and home health care (P < 0.001); spent more time on self-care; and had more difficulty with housework, meal preparation, and personal care. Differences in service use between urban and rural groups within the underserved group substantially exceeded differences between the underserved and nationally representative groups. These findings address a gap in knowledge about older, ethnically diverse individuals with diabetes living in medically underserved areas. This profile of disparate service use and health care practices among urban minority and rural majority underserved adults with diabetes can assist in the planning of future interventions.",

        "Abstract": "The risk of adverse cardiovascular events peaks in the morning (\u22489:00 AM) with a secondary peak in the evening (\u22488:00 PM) and a trough at night. This pattern is generally believed to be caused by the day/night distribution of behavioral triggers, but it is unknown whether the endogenous circadian system contributes to these daily fluctuations. Thus, we tested the hypotheses that the circadian system modulates autonomic, hemodynamic, and hemostatic risk markers at rest, and that behavioral stressors have different effects when they occur at different internal circadian phases. Twelve healthy adults were each studied in a 240-h forced desynchrony protocol in dim light while standardized rest and exercise periods were uniformly distributed across the circadian cycle. At rest, there were large circadian variations in plasma cortisol (peak-to-trough \u224885% of mean, peaking at a circadian phase corresponding to \u22489:00 AM) and in circulating catecholamines (epinephrine, \u224870%; norepinephrine, \u224835%, peaking during the biological day). At \u22488:00 PM, there was a circadian peak in blood pressure and a trough in cardiac vagal modulation. Sympathetic variables were consistently lowest and vagal markers highest during the biological night. We detected no simple circadian effect on hemostasis, although platelet aggregability had two peaks: at \u2248noon and \u224811:00 PM. There was circadian modulation of the cardiovascular reactivity to exercise, with greatest vagal withdrawal at \u22489:00 AM and peaks in catecholamine reactivity at \u22489:00 AM and \u22489:00 PM. Thus, the circadian system modulates numerous cardiovascular risk markers at rest as well as their reactivity to exercise, with resultant profiles that could potentially contribute to the day/night pattern of adverse cardiovascular events.",

This study examines the course of probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), its predictors and clinical consequences in a cohort of 455 primary care patients in New York City, interviewed approximately 1 and 4 years after 9/11. The rate of PTSD decreased from 9.6% to 4.1%. Pre-9/11 major depressive disorder emerged as the strongest predictor of PTSD, particularly late-PTSD. At follow-up, late-PTSD was associated with major depressive and anxiety disorders, and PTSD regardless of timing was associated with impaired functioning. Findings highlight the importance of ongoing evaluation of mental health needs in primary care settings in the aftermath of disasters.",

        "Abstract": "A telephone survey of Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes living in rural underserved areas and enrolled in the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine project identified 109 subjects who requested further training in functions of the home telemedicine unit after initial in-home training by regional nurse installers. The initial training provided the skills needed to videoconferences with nurse case managers and to transmit blood glucose and blood pressure readings, but further instruction was needed for access to Web-based education features and messaging. This study evaluated these elderly patients' perceptions of the helpfulness of three additional telemedicine training methods:in-home visit with an regional nurse installer referencing a user's manual, unassisted patient use of the user's manual, and telephone-based training not using regional nurse installers reinforcing the user's manual. Eligible subjects rated the helpfulness of the three computer training methods on a five-point Likert scale (1 = \"not helpful at all,\" 5 = \"very helpful\"). Participants rated \"in-home\" training with an regional nurse installer significantly higher than they did for the user's manual alone (P < .01). In response to this finding and other companion usability studies, Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine deployed home telemedicine units with enhanced remote training capabilities to better emulate characteristics of in-person training.",

        "Abstract": "Hypertension is associated with impaired endothelial function in cross-sectional studies. However, few longitudinal data exist on whether endothelial dysfunction precedes the development of hypertension. We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between endothelial-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and hypertension prevalence and incidence in 3500 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, an ethnically diverse, community-based cohort study. At baseline, the prevalence ratios (95% CI) of hypertension from the highest to the lowest quartile of FMD were 1.00 (referent), 1.26 (1.12 to 1.40), 1.35 (1.21 to 1.52), and 1.68 (1.50 to 1.87; linear trend P<0.001). This association remained (P=0.017) after adjustment for demographics (age, sex, and ethnicity), Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis site, and other risk factors. Of the 1869 participants without hypertension at baseline, 584 (31.3%) developed hypertension over a median follow-up of 4.8 years. The unadjusted relative risks (95% CI) of incident hypertension from the highest to the lowest quartile of FMD were 1.00 (referent), 1.38 (1.14 to 1.67), 1.44 (1.19 to 1.74), and 1.64 (1.36 to 1.97; linear trend P<0.001). However, after adjustment for demographics and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis site, the relationship between FMD and incident hypertension was attenuated and not statistically significant: 1.00 (referent), 1.26 (1.04 to 1.52), 1.19 (0.98 to 1.44), and 1.18 (0.97 to 1.44). The longitudinal results also did not appreciably change after adjustment for additional risk factors and baseline blood pressure levels. In this sample, reduced FMD was not an independent predictor of hypertension incidence, suggesting that impaired endothelial function does not play a major role in the development of hypertension.",

        "Abstract": "Objective To determine whether a diabetes case management telemedicine intervention reduced healthcare expenditures, as measured by Medicare claims, and to assess the costs of developing and implementing the telemedicine intervention. Design We studied 1665 participants in the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel), a randomized controlled trial comparing telemedicine case management of diabetes to usual care. Participants were aged 55 years or older, and resided in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York State. Measurements We analyzed Medicare claims payments for each participant for up to 60 study months from date of randomization, until their death, or until December 31, 2006 (whichever happened first). We also analyzed study expenditures for the telemedicine intervention over six budget years (February 28, 2000- February 27, 2006). Results Mean annual Medicare payments (SE) were similar in the usual care and telemedicine groups, $9040 ($386) and $9669 ($443) per participant, respectively (p>0.05). Sensitivity analyses, including stratification by censored status, adjustment by enrollment site, and semi-parametric weighting by probability of dropping-out, rendered similar results. Over six budget years 28 821 participant/months of telemedicine intervention were delivered, at an estimated cost of $622 per participant/month. Conclusion Telemedicine case management was not associated with a reduction in Medicare claims in this medically underserved population. The cost of implementing the telemedicine intervention was high, largely representing special purpose hardware and software costs required at the time. Lower implementation costs will need to be achieved using lower cost technology in order for telemedicine case management to be more widely used.",

        "Abstract": "The severity of many diseases varies across the day and night. For example, adverse cardiovascular incidents peak in the morning, asthma is often worse at night and temporal lobe epileptic seizures are most prevalent in the afternoon. These patterns may be due to the day/night rhythm in environment and behavior, and/or endogenous circadian rhythms in physiology. Furthermore, chronic misalignment between the endogenous circadian timing system and the behavioral cycles could be a cause of increased risk of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers in shift workers. Here we describe the magnitude, relevance and potential biological basis of such daily changes in disease severity and of circadian/behavioral misalignment, and present how these insights may help in the development of appropriate chronotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "Previous longitudinal cohort studies have suggested an association between baseline depressive symptoms and incident hypertension. We assessed this possible association using data from the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a population-based prospective cohort study of 6814 US adults from 4 different racial/ethnic groups. Baseline users of antihypertensive medications and participants lost to follow-up were excluded leaving 3914 participants. Patients with baseline depressive symptoms (n=622) were defined using a high score on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (>or=16) or the use of an antidepressant medication. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure of >or=140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of >or=90 mm Hg or new use of antihypertensive medications plus physician diagnosis. Estimates were adjusted for known risk factors, including age, sex, baseline blood pressure, diabetes, and body mass index. Untreated blood pressure was estimated using an imputation approach. A total of 477 participants developed hypertension. Using relative risk regression, patients with baseline depressive symptoms did not have an increased risk of incident hypertension (relative risk: 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99 to 1.05), although an association between tricyclic antidepressants and hypertension (relative risk: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.37) was observed in subgroup analysis. Depression, even after adjustment for covariates, was associated with small changes in systolic (+2.4 mm Hg; 95% CI: 0.2 to 4.7) and diastolic (+0.8 mm Hg; 95% CI: -0.6 to 2.3) blood pressures. Depressive symptoms may be associated with slight increases in blood pressure in this multiethnic cohort, but it is premature to conclude much without longer studies in other populations.",

Subjects were recruited from Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Los Angeles County, California; New York, New York; and St. Paul, Minnesota. Levels of depressive symptoms, trait anger, trait anxiety, chronic burdens, emotional support, and cynical distrust were assessed by questionnaire (from July 2000 to July 2002). Digital retinal images (from August 2002 to January 2004) from 6,147 participants were used to evaluate retinopathy and retinal vascular caliber. After controlling for potential confounding factors, the authors found that subjects without access to emotional support (Enriched Social Support Instrument score of <19 vs. > or = 19) had 60% greater odds of retinopathy (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 2.0). Subjects with high Spielberger trait-anxiety scale scores (> or = 22 vs. < or = 14) and subjects with high depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale score, > or = 16 vs. <16) were also more likely to have retinopathy (odds ratio = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.9 and odds ratio = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2, 1.9), respectively. In this cross-sectional study, lack of emotional support, increased trait anxiety, and more depressive symptoms were associated with retinopathy signs, independently of other known risk factors.",

        "Abstract": "Adiposity is associated with C-reactive protein level in healthy 2-3 year-old children and with other markers of endothelial activation in adults, but data are lacking in very young children. Data from 491 healthy Hispanic children were analyzed. Mean age was 2.7 years (SD 0.5, range 2-3 years); mean body mass index (BMI) was 17.2 kg/m2 (SD 1.9) among boys and 17.1 kg/m2 (SD 2.1) among girls. E-selectin level was associated with BMI (R = 0.11; p < 0.02), ponderal index (p < 0.02), waist circumference (p = 0.02), fasting insulin (p < 0.02), and insulin resistance (p < or = 0.05); these associations remained significant after adjustment for age, sex and fasting glucose. sVCAM was also associated with BMI (R = 0.12; p < 0.05). These observations indicate that adiposity is associated with inflammation and endothelial activation in very early childhood.",

        "Title": "Association of electrocardiographic abnormalities with coronary artery calcium and carotid artery intima-media thickness in individuals without clinical coronary heart disease (from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis [MESA]).",
        "Abstract": "Isolated minor nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities (NSSTAs), minor and major electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities are established, independent risk markers for incident cardiovascular events. Their association with subclinical atherosclerosis has been postulated but is not clearly defined. The aim of this study was to define the association between ECG abnormalities and measurements of subclinical atherosclerosis. We studied participants from MESA, a multiethnic sample of men and women 45 to 84 years of age and free of clinical cardiovascular disease at enrollment. Baseline examination included measurement of traditional risk factors, 12-lead electrocardiograms at rest, coronary artery calcium (CAC) measurement, and common carotid intima-media thickness (CC-IMT). Electrocardiograms were coded using Novacode criteria and were defined as having minor abnormalities (e.g., minor NSSTTAs, first-degree atrioventricular block, and QRS-axis deviations) or major abnormalities (e.g., pathologic Q waves, major STTAs, significant dysrhythmias, and conduction system delays). Multivariable logistic and linear regressions were used to determine cross-sectional associations of ECG abnormalities with CAC and CC-IMT. Of 6,710 participants, 52.7% were women, with a mean age of 62 years. After multivariable adjustment, isolated minor STTAs and minor and major ECG abnormalities were not associated with presence of CAC (>0) in men (odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.33; 1.10, 0.91 to 1.32; and 1.03, 0.81 to 1.31, respectively) or women (1.01, 0.82 to 1.24; 1.04, 0.87 to 1.23; and 0.94, 0.73 to 1.22, respectively). Lack of association remained consistent when using log CAC and CC-IMT as continuous variables. In conclusion, ECG abnormalities are not associated with markers of subclinical atherosclerosis in a large multiethnic cohort.",

        "Abstract": "Epileptiform abnormalities often occur at specific times of day or night, possibly attributable to state of consciousness (sleep vs. wake) and/or influences from the endogenous circadian pacemaker. In this pilot study we tested for the existence of circadian variation of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), independent of changes in state, environment, or behavior. Five patients with generalized epilepsy underwent a protocol whereby their sleep/wake schedule was evenly distributed across the circadian cycle while undergoing full-montage electroencephalography and hourly plasma melatonin measurements. Light was <8 lux to prevent circadian entrainment. All patients completed the protocol, testifying to its feasibility. All patients had normal circadian rhythmicity of plasma melatonin relative to their habitual sleep times. In the three patients with sufficient IEDs to assess variability, most IEDs occurred during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (ratio NREM:wake=14:1, P<0.001). In both patients who had NREM at all circadian phases, there was apparent circadian variation in IEDs but with different phases relative to peak melatonin.",

        "Abstract": "Telehealth interventions are feasible and efficacious. While patients are the focus of both quantitative and qualitative studies that assess their response to telehealth, little is known about the view of providers of telehealth services. The purpose of this study was to better understand the experiences of providers and the factors that they perceive to contribute to the success of telehealth interventions as well as to their own satisfaction. Face-to-face or telephone interviews were conducted with 10 diabetes educators (nurses and dietitians) who served as providers of a telemedicine case management intervention for older adults who have diabetes. Qualitative analyses revealed that providers were very satisfied with their experience and felt their efforts with patients were generally successful. Providers also identified a number of unique benefits to telehealth interventions. These included opportunities for more frequent contact with patients, greater relaxation and information due to the ability to interact with the patients in their own homes, increased ability to reach the underserved, more timely and accurate medical monitoring, and improved management of data. The primary disadvantages of telehealth they identified were technology problems and a concern about the lack of physical contact with patients. Findings illustrate providers' perspectives on the unique advantages of telehealth and offer insight as to how to make telehealth interventions more effective, as well as more satisfying for those who do the day-to-day work of providing the interventions.",

The associations between exposure to the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks in New York City and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms were examined in a sample of 929 primary care patients. After controlling for PTSD, depression, panic and substance use disorders, and pre-9/11 trauma, patients who screened positive (vs. negative) for GAD symptoms were roughly twice as likely to report having a loved one at the 9/11 disaster site, twice as likely to know someone who was killed by the attacks, and twice as likely to know someone who was involved with the rescue/recovery efforts after the disaster.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This study was an observational study examining mean levels of cardiovascular risk factors and proportion of subjects achieving treatment goals. RESULTS The sample included 926 individuals with diabetes. Compared with men, women were 9% less likely to achieve LDL cholesterol <130 mg/dl (adjusted prevalence ratio 0.91 [0.83-0.99]) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) <130 mmHg (adjusted prevalence ratio 0.91 [0.85-0.98]). These differences diminished over time. A lower percentage of women used aspirin (23 vs. 33%; P < 0.001). African American and Hispanic women had higher mean levels of SBP and lower prevalence of aspirin use than non-Hispanic white women. CONCLUSIONS Women with diabetes had unfavorable cardiovascular risk factor profiles compared with men. African American and Hispanic women had less favorable profiles than non-Hispanic white women.",

        "Abstract": "CONTEXT Telemedicine is a promising but largely unproven technology for providing case management services to patients with chronic conditions and lower access to care. OBJECTIVES To examine the effectiveness of a telemedicine intervention to achieve clinical management goals in older, ethnically diverse, medically underserved patients with diabetes. DESIGN, Setting, and Patients A randomized controlled trial was conducted, comparing telemedicine case management to usual care, with blinded outcome evaluation, in 1,665 Medicare recipients with diabetes, aged >/= 55 years, residing in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York State. Interventions Home telemedicine unit with nurse case management versus usual care. Main Outcome Measures The primary endpoints assessed over 5 years of follow-up were hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and blood pressure levels. RESULTS Intention-to-treat mixed models showed that telemedicine achieved net overall reductions over five years of follow-up in the primary endpoints (HgbA1c, p = 0.001; LDL, p < 0.001; systolic and diastolic blood pressure, p = 0.024; p < 0.001). Estimated differences (95% CI) in year 5 were 0.29 (0.12, 0.46)% for HgbA1c, 3.84 (-0.08, 7.77) mg/dL for LDL cholesterol, and 4.32 (1.93, 6.72) mm Hg for systolic and 2.64 (1.53, 3.74) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure. There were 176 deaths in the intervention group and 169 in the usual care group (hazard ratio 1.01 [0.82, 1.24]). CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine case management resulted in net improvements in HgbA1c, LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure levels over 5 years in medically underserved Medicare beneficiaries. Mortality was not different between the groups, although power was limited. Trial Registration http://clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00271739.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this evaluation was to determine the effect of redesigning the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) telemedicine architecture on the average upload delay and on the average number of glucose uploads to a central database. These two measures positively influence our ability to deliver timely and accurate patient care to the study population. The redesign was also undertaken to improve the patients' experience in using the system and thereby increase the frequency and timeliness of their self-monitoring behavior. Using the total number of glucose uploads, we compared the delay in glucose upload times according to the type of home telemedicine unit the study participants used and the region where the participants lived. The participants were Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes living in medically underserved neighborhoods in New York City and rural Upstate New York. The populations in these two regions differed considerably in terms of ethnicity, language spoken (Spanish, English), and education level. Participants who had Generation 2 (Gen 2) (mean = 10.75, SD +/- 7.96) home telemedicine units had significantly shorter upload delay times (p < 0.001) as measured in days than those participants with Generation 1 (Gen 1) (mean = 22.44, SD +/- 11.18) and those who were upgraded from Gen 1 (mean = 20.67, SD +/- 8.85) to Gen 2 (mean = 14.93, SD +/- 9.37). Additionally, the delay was significantly shorter for participants living upstate (mean = 24.14 days, SD +/- 11.95 days) than downstate (mean = 15.30 days, SD +/- 7.87 days), t (975) = 13.98, p < 0.01. The system redesign made a significant impact in reducing glucose upload delays of IDEATel participants. However, upload delays were significantly impacted by the region where the participants resided.",

        "Abstract": "Home telemedicine is an emerging healthcare paradigm that has the potential to transform the treatment of chronic illness. The purpose of this paper is to: (1) develop a theoretical and methodological framework for studying workflow in telemediated clinician-patient encounters drawing on a distributed cognition approach and (2) employ the framework in an in-depth analysis of workflow in the IDEATel project, a telemedicine program for older adults with diabetes. The methods employed in this research included (a) videotaped observations of 27 nurse-patient encounters and (b) semi-structured interviews with participants. The analyses were used to provide a descriptive analysis of video visits, understand the mediating role of different technologies and to characterize the ways in which artifacts and representations are used to understand the state of the patient. The study revealed barriers to productive use of telehealth technology as well as adaptations that circumvented such limitations. This research has design implications for: (a) improving the coordination of communication and (b) developing tools that better integrate and display information. Although home telemedicine programs will differ in important respects, there are invariant properties across such systems. Explicating these properties can serve as a needs requirement analysis to develop more effective systems and implementation plans.",

Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was assessed 981 white, black and Hispanic men and women aged 45-84 years participating in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Direct measurement and questionnaire were used to assess covariates. Linear regression was used to estimate associations of LTL with race/ethnicity and age after adjustment for sex, income, education, smoking, physical activity, diet and body mass index. On average blacks and Hispanics had shorter telomeres than whites [adjusted mean differences (standard error) in T/S ratio compared to whites: -0.041 (0.018) for blacks and -0.044 (0.018) for Hispanics]. Blacks and Hispanics showed greater differences in telomere length associated with age than whites (adjusted mean differences in T/S ratio per 1 year increase in age -0.0018, -0.0047 and -0.0055 in whites, blacks and Hispanics respectively). Differences in age associations were more pronounced and only statistically significant in women. Race/ethnic differences in LTL may reflect the cumulative burden of differential exposure to oxidative stress (and its predictors) over the lifecourse.",

        "Title": "Adverse metabolic and cardiovascular consequences of circadian misalignment.",
        "Abstract": "There is considerable epidemiological evidence that shift work is associated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, perhaps the result of physiologic maladaptation to chronically sleeping and eating at abnormal circadian times. To begin to understand underlying mechanisms, we determined the effects of such misalignment between behavioral cycles (fasting/feeding and sleep/wake cycles) and endogenous circadian cycles on metabolic, autonomic, and endocrine predictors of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk. Ten adults (5 female) underwent a 10-day laboratory protocol, wherein subjects ate and slept at all phases of the circadian cycle-achieved by scheduling a recurring 28-h \"day.\" Subjects ate 4 isocaloric meals each 28-h \"day.\" For 8 days, plasma leptin, insulin, glucose, and cortisol were measured hourly, urinary catecholamines 2 hourly (totaling approximately 1,000 assays/subject), and blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac vagal modulation, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio, and polysomnographic sleep daily. Core body temperature was recorded continuously for 10 days to assess circadian phase. Circadian misalignment, when subjects ate and slept approximately 12 h out of phase from their habitual times, systematically decreased leptin (-17%, P < 0.001), increased glucose (+6%, P < 0.001) despite increased insulin (+22%, P = 0.006), completely reversed the daily cortisol rhythm (P < 0.001), increased mean arterial pressure (+3%, P = 0.001), and reduced sleep efficiency (-20%, P < 0.002). Notably, circadian misalignment caused 3 of 8 subjects (with sufficient available data) to exhibit postprandial glucose responses in the range typical of a prediabetic state. These findings demonstrate the adverse cardiometabolic implications of circadian misalignment, as occurs acutely with jet lag and chronically with shift work.",

        "Title": "Reduction of scale invariance of activity fluctuations with aging and Alzheimer's disease: Involvement of the circadian pacemaker.",
        "Abstract": "Human motor control systems orchestrate complex scale-invariant patterns of activity over a wide range of time scales (minutes to hours). The neural mechanisms underlying scale-invariance are unknown in humans. In rats, the master circadian pacemaker [suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)] is crucially involved in scale-invariant activity fluctuations over multiple time scales from minutes to 24 h. Aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with progressive dysfunction of the SCN. Thus, if the SCN is responsible for the scale-invariant activity fluctuations in humans, we predict disturbances of scale-invariant activity fluctuations in elderly humans and even more pronounced disturbances in elderly humans with AD. To test these hypotheses, we studied spontaneous daytime activity patterns in 13 young adults (mean +/- SD: 25.5 +/- 6.1 y); 13 elderly people with early-stage AD (68.5 +/- 6.1 y) matched with 13 elderly controls (68.6 +/- 6.1 y); and 14 very old people with late-stage AD (83.9 +/- 6.7 y) matched with 12 very old controls (80.8 +/- 8.6 y). In young adults, activity exhibited robust scale-invariant correlations across all tested time scales (minutes to 8 h). The scale-invariant correlations at 1.5-8 h declined with age (P = 0.01) and were significantly reduced in the elderly (P = 0.04) and very old controls (P = 0.02). Remarkably, an age-independent AD effect further reduced the scale-invariant correlations at 1.5-8 h (P = 0.04), leading to the greatest reduction of the scale-invariant correlations in very old people with late-stage AD-resembling closely the loss of correlations at large time scales in SCN-lesioned animals. Thus, aging and AD significantly attenuate the scale invariance of activity fluctuations over multiple time scales. This attenuation may reflect functional changes of the SCN.",

The Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) project is a demonstration project to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of telemedicine with diverse, medically underserved, older diabetes patients. Subjects were randomised to telemedicine case management or usual care. This intervention has been shown to result in improved medical outcomes and self-efficacy. Self-efficacy refers to one's belief that (s)he can successfully engage in a behaviour. Self-efficacy has been shown to relate to behaviour change and glycaemic control in middle-aged individuals, but not studied in older individuals.",

        "Abstract": "Black blood turbo spin echo (TSE) imaging of the right ventricle (RV) free wall is highly sensitive to cardiac motion, frequently resulting in nondiagnostic images. Temporal and spatial parameters of a black blood TSE pulse sequence were evaluated for visualization of the RV free wall. Seventy-four patient studies were retrospectively evaluated for the effects of acquisition timing on image quality. Axial black blood TSE images were acquired on 10 healthy volunteers to assess the role of spatial misregistration on right ventricle visualization; increasing the double inversion recovery (DIR) slice thickness beyond 300% had no effect on image quality (P = 0.2). Thirty-five patient studies were prospectively evaluated with inversion times (TIs) corresponding to the mid-diastolic rest period and end-systole based on visual analysis of a four chamber cine. When TIs were chosen to be within the patients' RV rest period, mean image quality score was significantly improved (2.3 vs 1.86; P < 0.001) and the number of clinically diagnostic images increased from 32% to 46%. Black blood TSE imaging of the RV free wall is highly sensitive to cardiac motion. Image quality can be improved by choosing TIs concordant with the rest period of the patient's RV that may occur at mid-diastole or end-systole.",

        "Abstract": "This study examines the long-term psychiatric consequences, pain interference in daily activities, work loss, and functional impairment associated with 9/11-related loss among low-income, minority primary care patients in New York City. A systematic sample of 929 adult patients completed a survey that included a sociodemographic questionnaire, the PTSD Checklist, the PRIME-MD Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12 (SF-12). Approximately one-quarter of the sample reported knowing someone who was killed in the attacks of 9/11, and these patients were sociodemographically similar to the rest of the sample. Compared to patients who had not experienced 9/11-related loss, patients who experienced loss were roughly twice as likely (OR = 1.97, 95%; CI = 1.40, 2.77) to screen positive for at least one mental disorder, including major depressive disorder (MDD; 29.2%), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; 19.4%), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 17.1%). After controlling for pre-9/11 trauma, 9/11-related loss was significantly related to extreme pain interference, work loss, and functional impairment. The results suggest that disaster-related mental health care in this clinical population should emphasize evidence-based treatments for mood and anxiety disorders.",

        "Abstract": "In a multiethnic cohort of older people with diabetes (n=1178), we assessed whether ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring improves prediction of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality when added to baseline covariates, including office BP and heart rate (HR). Secondary analyses assessed whether albuminuria may mediate the association of pulse pressure with mortality. The ambulatory arterial stiffness index was calculated as \"1-slope\" from the within-person regression of diastolic-on-systolic ambulatory BP readings. Mean follow-up was 6.6+/-0.4 years. There were 287 deaths; death certificates were available for 215 deaths (75%), and 110 of them were deemed of cardiovascular cause. Cox models were built incrementally. First, models using clinical and laboratory variables selected albuminuria and office HRs as independent predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. When ambulatory monitoring data were added, sleep:wake HR ratio and ambulatory arterial stiffness index added significantly to the prediction of all-cause mortality, but only sleep:wake HR ratio added to the prediction of cardiovascular mortality. Office HR and albuminuria retained significance as predictors of both types of mortality. Secondary analyses without adjustment for albuminuria confirmed the predictive value of office HR and sleep/wake HR, whereas 24-hour pulse pressure and sleep systolic BP were also independently predictive of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively. In conclusion, office HR and albuminuria were strong predictors of mortality. Ambulatory monitoring improved the prediction of risk through its assessment of sleep HR dipping and of ambulatory arterial stiffness index, a measure of the dynamic relationship between systolic and diastolic BPs. Albuminuria may mediate the association between BP and mortality.",

        "Abstract": "This qualitative research focuses on understanding the experiences of elderly patients with diabetes who participated in a telemedicine case management intervention, to better understand the barriers to success of telemedicine with the elderly. Telephone interviews were conducted with elderly patients with diabetes prior to and 6 and 12 months after participating in a case management intervention delivered via a computer that allowed them to teleconference with a nurse and dietitian, upload blood glucose and blood pressure data, and access educational materials. Qualitative analyses revealed that patients enrolled primarily because healthcare providers encouraged them. Their goals were to improve diabetes control, with few expectations of an effect on emotional health or family relationships. After involvement, they particularly valued the emphasis on monitoring of health outcomes and supportive contact with diabetes staff to encourage, remind, and answer questions. Findings illustrate the potential value of telemedicine with elderly patients with diabetes, if supported by primary care providers and including consistent, supportive interactions with knowledgeable diabetes healthcare providers.",

        "Abstract": "We studied the perceptions of primary care providers (PCPs) about the telemedicine intervention in a trial of telemedicine for management of diabetes in medically under-served areas of New York State. A survey was mailed to 206 rural and 159 urban PCPs. The response rates were 25% and 22%, respectively. Eighty percent of respondents believed that a diabetes telemedicine case management system would help their practice. An overall satisfaction score (possible range 0-80) suggested good acceptability (mean 66, SD 12). In multiple linear regression, the rural location and younger age of the PCPs were independent predictors of higher satisfaction (both P < 0.01). Within-PCP comparisons showed a higher perceived impact on patients, as compared to impact on PCP practices (P < 0.001). However, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the low response rates.",

        "Title": "An endogenous circadian rhythm in sleep inertia results in greatest cognitive impairment upon awakening during the biological night.",
        "Abstract": "Sleep inertia is the impaired cognitive performance immediately upon awakening, which decays over tens of minutes. This phenomenon has relevance to people who need to make important decisions soon after awakening, such as on-call emergency workers. Such awakenings can occur at varied times of day or night, so the objective of the study was to determine whether or not the magnitude of sleep inertia varies according to the phase of the endogenous circadian cycle. Twelve adults (mean, 24 years; 7 men) with no medical disorders other than mild asthma were studied. Following 2 baseline days and nights, subjects underwent a forced desynchrony protocol composed of seven 28-h sleep/wake cycles, while maintaining a sleep/wakefulness ratio of 1:2 throughout. Subjects were awakened by a standardized auditory stimulus 3 times each sleep period for sleep inertia assessments. The magnitude of sleep inertia was quantified as the change in cognitive performance (number of correct additions in a 2-min serial addition test) across the first 20 min of wakefulness. Circadian phase was estimated from core body temperature (fitted temperature minimum assigned 0 degrees ). Data were segregated according to: (1) circadian phase (60 degrees bins); (2) sleep stage; and (3) 3rd of the night after which awakenings occurred (i.e., tertiary 1, 2, or 3). To control for any effect of sleep stage, the circadian rhythm of sleep inertia was initially assessed following awakenings from Stage 2 (62% of awakening occurred from this stage; n = 110). This revealed a significant circadian rhythm in the sleep inertia of cognitive performance (p = 0.007), which was 3.6 times larger during the biological night (circadian bin 300 degrees , approximately 2300-0300 h in these subjects) than during the biological day (bin 180 degrees , approximately 1500-1900 h). The circadian rhythm in sleep inertia was still present when awakenings from all sleep stages were included (p = 0.004), and this rhythm could not be explained by changes in underlying sleep drive prior to awakening (changes in sleep efficiency across circadian phase or across the tertiaries), or by the proportion of the varied sleep stages prior to awakenings. This robust endogenous circadian rhythm in sleep inertia may have important implications for people who need to be alert soon after awakening.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of the study was to develop and implement an architecture for remote training that can be used in the narrowband home telemedicine environment. A remote training architecture, the REmote Patient Education in a Telemedicine Environment (REPETE) architecture, using a remote control protocol (RCP) was developed. A set of design criteria was specified. The developed architecture was integrated into the IDEATel home telemedicine unit (HTU) and evaluated against these design criteria using a combination of technical and expert evaluations. Technical evaluation of the architecture demonstrated that remote cursor movements and positioning displayed on the HTU were smooth and effectively real-time. The trainers were able to observe within approximately 2 seconds lag what the patient sees on their HTU screen. Evaluation of the architecture by experts was favorable. Responses to a Likert scale questionnaire regarding audio quality and remote control performance indicated that the expert evaluators thought that the audio quality and remote control performance were adequate for remote training. All evaluators strongly agreed that the system would be useful for training patients. The REPETE architecture supports basic training needs over a narrowband dial-up connection. We were able to maintain an audio chat simultaneously with performing a remote training session, while maintaining both acceptable audio quality and remote control performance. The RCP provides a mechanism to provide training without requiring a trainer to go to the patient's home and effectively supports deictic referencing to on screen objects.",

        "Abstract": "Adverse cardiovascular events in humans occur with a day/night pattern, presumably related to a daily pattern of behaviours or endogenous circadian rhythms in cardiovascular variables. Healthy humans possess a scale-invariant/fractal structure in heartbeat fluctuations that exhibits an endogenous circadian rhythm and changes towards the structure observed in cardiovascular disease at the circadian phase corresponding to the time of the broad peak of adverse cardiovascular events (at about 10 AM). To explore the relationship between the rest/activity cycle, endogenous circadian rhythmicity, and cardiac vulnerability, we tested whether the fractal structure of heart rate exhibits a similar circadian rhythm in a mammalian species that is nocturnally active (Wistar rats) compared with diurnally active humans, and how this fractal structure changes after lesioning the circadian pacemaker (suprachiasmatic nucleus, SCN) in rats.",

        "Abstract": "Telemedicine is a promising but largely unproven technology for providing case management services to patients with chronic conditions who experience barriers to access to care or a high burden of illness. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing telemedicine case management to usual care, with blinding of those obtaining outcome data, in 1,665 Medicare recipients with diabetes, aged 55 years or greater, and living in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York State. In New York City, 98% of participants were black or Hispanic, 69% were Medicaid-eligible, and 93% reported annual household income < or =$20,000. In upstate New York, 91% were white, 14% Medicaid eligible, and 50% reported annual household income < or =$20,000. A baseline survey found that 95% of participants in New York City and 67% in upstate New York reported that they did not know how to use a computer. The primary endpoints were HgbA1c, blood pressure, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. In the intervention group (N = 844), mean HgbA1c improved over 1 year from 7.35% to 6.97%, and from 8.35% to 7.42% in the subgroup with baseline HgbA1c > or =7% (N = 353). In the usual care group (N = 821), mean HgbA1c improved over 1 year from 7.42% to 7.17%. Adjusted net reductions (1-year minus baseline mean values in each group, compared between groups) favoring the intervention were as follows: HgbA1c, 0.18% (p = 0.006), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 3.4 (p = 0.001) and 1.9 mmHg (p < 0.001), and LDL cholesterol, 9.5 mg/dl (p < 0.001). In the subgroup with baseline HgbA1c > or =7%, net adjusted reduction in HgbA1c favoring the intervention group was 0.32% (p = 0.002). Mean LDL cholesterol level in the intervention group at one year was 95.7 mg/dl. The intervention effects were similar in magnitude in the subgroups living in New York City and upstate New York. A satisfaction survey of intervention group participants (N = 346 respondents) showed high levels of satisfaction with major intervention components. A satisfaction survey of participating primary care physicians (N = 116 respondents) showed positive perceptions for acceptability, impact on patients and communication. Telemedicine case management improved glycemic control, blood pressure levels, and total and LDL-cholesterol levels at 1 year of follow-up. Telemedicine is an effective method for translating modern approaches to disease management into effective care for underserved populations.",

        "Abstract": "Heartbeat fluctuations in mammals display a robust temporal structure characterized by scale-invariant/fractal patterns. These scale-invariant patterns likely confer physiological advantage because they change with cardiovascular disease and these changes are associated with reduced survival. Models of physical systems imply that to produce scale-invariant patterns, factors influencing the system at different time scales must be coupled via a network of feedback interactions. A similar cardiac control network is hypothesized to be responsible for the scale-invariant pattern in heartbeat dynamics, although the essential network components have not been determined. Here is shown that scale-invariant cardiac control occurs across time scales from minutes to approximately 24 h, and that lesioning the mammalian circadian pacemaker (suprachiasmatic nucleus; SCN) completely abolishes the scale-invariant pattern at time scales>or approximately 4 h. At time scales<or approximately 4 h, the scale invariance persisted following SCN lesion but with a different pattern. These results indicate previously unrecognized multiscale influences of the SCN on heart rate fluctuations that cannot be explained by a simple pacemaker of 24-h rhythmicity. The conclusion is that the SCN serves as a major node in the cardiac control network and imparts scale-invariant cardiac control across a wide range of time scales with strongest effects between approximately 4 and 24 h. These results demonstrate that experimental manipulations (e.g., SCN lesion) can be used to begin to model and understand the origin of scale-invariant behavior in a neurophysiological system.",

        "Abstract": "We assessed whether home blood pressure monitoring improved the prediction of progression of albuminuria when added to office measurements and compared it with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in a multiethnic cohort of older people (n=392) with diabetes mellitus, without macroalbuminuria, participating in the telemedicine arm of the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine Study. Albuminuria was assessed by measuring the spot urine albumin:creatinine ratio at baseline and annually for 3 years. The ambulatory sleep:wake systolic blood pressure ratio was categorized as dipping (ratio: < or =0.9), nondipping (ratio: >0.9 to 1.0), and nocturnal rise (ratio: >1.0). In a repeated-measures mixed linear model, after adjustment that included office pulse pressure, home pulse pressure was independently associated with a higher follow-up albumin:creatinine ratio (P=0.001). That association persisted (P=0.01) after adjusting for 24-hour pulse pressure and nocturnal rise, which were also independent predictors (P=0.02 and P=0.03, respectively). Cox proportional hazards models examined the progression of albuminuria (n=74) as defined by cutoff values used by clinicians. After the adjustment for office pulse pressure, the hazards ratio (95% CI) per 10-mm Hg increment of home pulse pressure was 1.34 (range: 1.1 to 1.7; P=0.01). Home pulse pressure was not an independent predictor in the model including ambulatory monitoring data; a nocturnal rise was the only independent predictor (P=0.035). Cox models built separately for home pulse pressure and ambulatory monitoring exhibited similar calibration and discrimination. In conclusion, nocturnal blood pressure elevation was the strongest predictor of worsening albuminuria. Home blood pressure measurements added to office measurements and may constitute an adequate substitute for ambulatory monitoring.",

        "Abstract": "This study investigated associations between neighborhood physical and social environments and body mass index in 2,865 participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) aged 45-84 years and residing in Maryland, New York, and North Carolina. Neighborhood (census tract) environments were measured in non-MESA participants residing in MESA neighborhoods (2000-2002). The neighborhood physical environment score combined measures of a better walking environment and greater availability of healthy foods. The neighborhood social environment score combined measures of greater aesthetic quality, safety, and social cohesion and less violent crime. Marginal maximum likelihood was used to estimate associations between neighborhood environments and body mass index (kg/m(2)) before and after adjustment for individual-level covariates. MESA residents of neighborhoods with better physical environments had lower body mass index (mean difference per standard deviation higher neighborhood measure = -2.38 (95% confidence interval (CI): -3.38, -1.38) kg/m(2) for women and -1.20 (95% CI: -1.84, -0.57) kg/m(2) for men), independent of age, race/ethnicity, education, and income. Attenuation of these associations after adjustment for diet and physical activity suggests a mediating role of these behaviors. In men, the mean body mass index was higher in areas with better social environments (mean difference = 0.52 (95% CI: 0.07, 0.97) kg/m(2)). Improvement in the neighborhood physical environment should be considered for its contribution to reducing obesity.",

We examined associations between measures of neighborhood problems and neighborhood social cohesion with depression, smoking, drinking, and walking for exercise in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort. Neighborhoods were characterized according to participant self-report and aggregated measures based on other MESA participants. Individuals living in the least problematic neighborhoods were significantly less likely to be depressed, to smoke, or to drink. Less socially cohesive neighborhoods were associated with increased depression, smoking, and not walking for exercise. Results persisted after adjusting for individual-level variables. Each measure appeared to capture distinct features of the neighborhood and associations did not differ by race/ethnicity. Results for neighborhood problems were robust to the use of aggregate measures but results for social cohesion generally were not. Future work should determine the health effect of modifying specific features of the neighborhood context.",

        "Abstract": "Ambulatory 24-hour pulse pressure predicts progression of albuminuria in persons with diabetes mellitus. The authors assessed whether nocturnal blood pressure (BP) patterns added predictive information and examined the multivariate-adjusted association of nocturnal BP patterns with progression of urine albumin excretion during follow-up in a multiethnic cohort of older people (n=957) with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were free of macroalbuminuria. Albuminuria was assessed by spot urine measurement of albumin-to-creatinine ratio at baseline and annually for 3 years. Participants were categorized according to their sleep/wake systolic BP ratio as dippers (ratio </=0.9; n=295), nondippers (flat nocturnal pattern, ratio >0.9 to 1; n=475), and nocturnal BP risers (ratio >1; n=187). The proportion exhibiting progression of albuminuria in dippers, nondippers, and risers was 17.6%, 22.9%, and 27.3%, respectively (P for linear trend = .01). A nocturnal BP rise was independently associated with progression of albuminuria (hazard ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-2.60; P=.02), whereas office pulse pressure was not. When ambulatory 24-hour pulse pressure was added to the model, the nocturnal BP rise remained an independent predictor of progression of albuminuria (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.02-2.45; P=.04). Nocturnal nondipping (without BP increase) was not an independent predictor. In conclusion, nocturnal BP rise on ambulatory monitoring is superior to office BP to predict worsening of albuminuria in elderly individuals with type 2 diabetes and adds to the information provided by 24-hour pulse pressure.",

        "Abstract": "The endogenous circadian pacemaker influences key physiologic functions, such as body temperature and heart rate, and is normally synchronized with the sleep/wake cycle. Epidemiological studies demonstrate a 24-h pattern in adverse cardiovascular events with a peak at approximately 10 a.m. It is unknown whether this pattern in cardiac risk is caused by a day/night pattern of behaviors, including activity level and/or influences from the internal circadian pacemaker. We recently found that a scaling index of cardiac vulnerability has an endogenous circadian peak at the circadian phase corresponding to approximately 10 a.m., which conceivably could contribute to the morning peak in cardiac risk. Here, we test whether this endogenous circadian influence on cardiac dynamics is caused by circadian-mediated changes in motor activity or whether activity and heart rate dynamics are decoupled across the circadian cycle. We analyze high-frequency recordings of motion from young healthy subjects during two complementary protocols that decouple the sleep/wake cycle from the circadian cycle while controlling scheduled behaviors. We find that static activity properties (mean and standard deviation) exhibit significant circadian rhythms with a peak at the circadian phase corresponding to 5-9 p.m. ( approximately 9 h later than the peak in the scale-invariant index of heartbeat fluctuations). In contrast, dynamic characteristics of the temporal scale-invariant organization of activity fluctuations (long-range correlations) do not exhibit a circadian rhythm. These findings suggest that endogenous circadian-mediated activity variations are not responsible for the endogenous circadian rhythm in the scale-invariant structure of heartbeat fluctuations and likely do not contribute to the increase in cardiac risk at approximately 10 a.m.",

        "Abstract": "We examined the relationship between whole grain intake and obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation, diabetes and subclinical CVD using baseline data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Whole grain intake was measured by a 127-item FFQ in 5496 men and women free of CHD and previously known diabetes. Mean whole grain intake was 0.5 (sd 0.5) servings per d; biochemical measures reflect fasting levels. After adjustment for demographic and health behaviour variables, mean differences for the highest quintile of whole grain intake minus the lowest quintile of intake were 0.6 kg/m2 for BMI, 0.36 mg/l for C-reactive protein, 0.82 micromol/l for homocysteine, 0.15 mU/l*mmol/l for homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), 0.48 mU/l for serum insulin, 2.0 mg/dl for glucose and 5.7 % for prevalence of newly diagnosed impaired fasting glucose (glucose >or= 100 mg/dl or diabetes medication). These differences represent 11-13 % of a standard deviation of BMI, HOMA, glucose and impaired fasting glucose, but 23 %, 52 % and 80 % of a standard deviation of homocysteine, C-reactive protein and insulin, respectively. An inverse association between whole grains and urine albumin excretion was suggested but retained statistical significance after adjustment only in Chinese and Hispanic participants. No associations were observed between whole grain intake and two subclinical disease measures: carotid intima-media thickness and coronary artery calcification. Concordant with previous research, whole grain intake was inversely associated with obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation and elevated fasting glucose or newly diagnosed diabetes. Counter to hypothesis, however, whole grain intake was unrelated to subclinical CVD.",

We performed a prospective survey of participants and non-participants during recruitment for the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) study, a randomized trial of telemedicine case management of diabetes mellitus in medically underserved elderly. There were two recruitment areas: urban New York City, and rural upstate New York. A Participant Questionnaire (PQ) was administered at the baseline IDEATel visit, and a Non-Participant Questionnaire (NPQ) was administered during the recruitment telephone call. Both questionnaires listed possible responses; subjects could choose more than one response or give their own. Of 1,660 IDEATel participants, 99.7% completed the PQ. Most frequent reason for participation was the belief that the technology could help them (52% and 42% of urban and rural respondents, respectively). Of the 2,231 subjects refusing participation, 28% answered the NPQ (90% of respondents were from rural area). Most frequent reasons not to participate in the rural area were being too busy (23%), and discomfort with the technology (22%), and in the urban area the belief that the technology could not help them (71%), discomfort with it (52%), and not liking to participate in studies (52%). In multivariate analysis (rural respondents only), knowing how to use a computer was an independent predictor of participation (p < 0.001). In conclusion, perceptions and beliefs regarding technology, including the expectation to benefit from it, played an important role in the decision to participate.",

        "Abstract": "Business model and financial recovery issues dominate discussions about using telemedicine to improve chronic disease management. The technical issues are numerous, daunting and complex, but many can be addressed using the resources and infrastructure available in large, well-integrated clinical information systems. The cost-benefit balance will change when it becomes possible to use devices that are owned by patients for everyday use, rather than installing special-purpose devices for telemedicine. Technology and communications capabilities are driven mainly by market factors other than uses for health care. Provider-side telemedicine capabilities, specifically for upload, storage and display of home medical data, will improve as technology develops. How health-care providers will process the larger amount of data made available by telemedicine is a clinical issue, but it is likely that software will emerge to assist in this task. The alignment of financial incentives for health-care providers is a decisive factor in understanding why telemedicine has had substantial deployment within the US Veterans Hospital Administration system, and to some extent within prison health systems and the Kaiser Permanente Health Plan, but much less widely in other settings.",

        "Abstract": "We studied whether ambulatory blood pressure monitoring added to office blood pressure in predicting progression of urine albumin excretion over 2 years of follow-up in a multiethnic cohort of older people with type-2 diabetes mellitus. Participants in the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine study underwent a baseline evaluation that included office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement and a spot urine measurement of albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). Measurements of albumin-to-creatinine ratio were repeated 1 and 2 years later. In bivariate analyses, ambulatory 24-hour pulse pressure was the blood pressure variable most strongly associated with follow-up ACR. Repeated-measures mixed linear models (n = 1040) were built adjusting for baseline ACR ratio, clustered randomization, time to follow-up, and multiple covariates. When both were entered into the model, ambulatory 24-hour pulse pressure and office pulse pressure were independently associated with follow-up ACR (beta [SE] = 0.010 [0.002], P < 0.001, and 0.004 [0.001], P = 0.002, respectively). Cox proportional hazards models examined associations with progression of albuminuria in 954 participants without macroalbuminuria at baseline, adjusting for all of the covariates independently associated with follow-up ACR in mixed linear models. Ambulatory 24-hour pulse pressure, but not office pulse pressure, was independently associated with progression of albuminuria (P = 0.015 and 0.052, respectively). The adjusted hazards ratio (95% CI) per each 10-mm Hg increment in ambulatory pulse pressure was 1.23 (1.04 to 1.42). In conclusion, ambulatory pulse pressure may provide additional information to predict progression of albuminuria in elderly diabetic subjects above and beyond office blood pressure.",

        "Abstract": "Plasma sphingomyelin has been shown to be an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, but the relation of plasma sphingomyelin to earlier, subclinical atherosclerotic disease has not been reported. The authors examined the association between plasma sphingomyelin and three measures of subclinical cardiovascular disease (carotid intimal-medial wall thickness, ankle-arm blood pressure index, and Agatston coronary artery calcium score) among 6,814 middle-aged, asymptomatic adults in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, which was initiated in 2000. The sphingomyelin level was positively correlated with lipids and the Framingham risk score (p < 0.01 for both), and the mean level was higher in women than men (50 (standard deviation (SD), 16) vs. 45 (SD, 15) mg/dl) (p < 0.01) and higher in never versus current smokers (49 (SD, 16) vs. 45 (SD, 17) mg/dl) (p < 0.01). Women with sphingomyelin levels of 60 or more mg/dl had more severe subclinical disease by all three measures than did the referent group with sphingomyelin levels of 39 or less mg/dl, although associations were not significant after multivariate adjustment for standard cardiovascular disease risk factors. Men with sphingomyelin levels of 60 or more mg/dl versus those with sphingomyelin levels of 39 or less mg/dl had higher calcium scores (135 vs. 99 Agatston units) (p = 0.01). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that plasma sphingomyelin is in the biologic pathway that mediates the risk for subclinical disease attributable to standard cardiovascular disease risk factors.",

        "Abstract": "Blood pressure strongly predicts microalbuminuria and later progression to renal failure in people with diabetes. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring seems to be superior to office blood pressure in predicting progression to microalbuminuria in type 1 diabetes. The associations of ambulatory blood pressure with office blood pressure and microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetes remain unclear. We studied the association of office blood pressure taken with an automated device and ambulatory blood pressure with spot urine albumin:creatinine ratio in 1180 older people with type 2 diabetes participating in the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine Study. Office and awake systolic blood pressure were independently associated with albuminuria (P<0.001 for both) in a multivariate linear regression analysis that adjusted for age, gender, duration of diabetes, hemoglobin A1c, number of antihypertensive medications, and use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Twelve percent of participants had well-controlled office blood pressure but not ambulatory blood pressure, whereas 14% had well-controlled ambulatory but not office blood pressure. The prevalence of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria in these subgroups was intermediate between those with well-controlled or uncontrolled blood pressure by both methods. We found, in a multiethnic group of older subjects with type 2 diabetes, that office systolic blood pressure and awake systolic ambulatory blood pressure exhibited independent associations with degree of albuminuria.",

        "Abstract": "Home telehealth involves the use of video conferencing or remote monitoring equipment in patients' homes. The installation of hardware and training of patients has historically been performed by nurses, typically RNs. This article examines the experience of RNs as telehealth installers in the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) project, where RNs were responsible for the installation of the Home Telemedicine Units (HTUs) and for training patients in the use of the HTUs, blood pressure cuffs, and fingerstick glucose meters. Average installation and training time was 166 minutes (SD 51 min). Structured interviews with RN installers revealed that patient education and training accounted for roughly two thirds of the in-home time. Technology-related problems, especially those related to telecommunications, were the primary cause of installation difficulties. Thematic analysis of installer interviews identified eight major themes and confirmed the importance of both clinical and technical knowledge during the telehealth installation process.",

        "Title": "The common insertional polymorphism in the APOC1 promoter is associated with serum apolipoprotein C-I levels in Hispanic children.",
        "Abstract": "We examined the effect of APOC1-317insCGTT allele status (HpaI RFLP, deletion [H1] and insertion [H2] alleles) on serum apolipoprotein (apo) C-I level in 362 Hispanic children in the Columbia University BioMarkers Study. The H2 allele was present in 147 subjects (40.6%). Serum apoC-I was 20% lower in the presence of the H2 allele in APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 homozygotes (P=0.003) but did not differ by H2 status in epsilon4 carriers. Insufficient numbers of epsilon2 carriers (N=45) were present for analysis. In multivariate analysis in the epsilon3/epsilon3 context, after adjusting for potential covariate effects and familial aggregation, the mean effect of H2/* versus H1/H1 on apoC-I level, was estimated to be 2.15+/-0.55mg/dl (P<0.0025). Plasma triglyceride level was weakly correlated with serum apoC-I level (Pearson's r=0.17, P<0.001) but was highly correlated with serum apoC-III (Pearson's r=0.74, P<0.0001). Nevertheless, presence of the H2 allele was not significantly associated with serum apoC-III level. Thus, the effect of APOC1 genotype on serum apoC-I level was not due to apoC-I level serving as a surrogate for triglyceride level. The APOC1-317insCGTT allele is a commonly polymorphic genetic marker that is associated with serum apoC-I level in the APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 context. These findings suggest that the mechanism of the previously described association with plasma TG is, at least in part, related to the correlation of the polymorphism with the level of expression of apoC-I.",

We demonstrate that the apparently random forearm motion possesses dynamic patterns characterized by robust scale-invariant and nonlinear features. These patterns remain stable from one subject to another and are unaffected by changes in the average activity level that occur within individual subjects throughout the day and on different days of the week, since they persist during daily routine and when the same subjects undergo time-isolation laboratory experiments designed to account for the circadian phase and to control the known extrinsic factors. Further, by modeling the scheduled events imposed throughout the laboratory protocols, we demonstrate that they cannot account for the observed scaling patterns in activity fluctuations.

        "Abstract": "Leptin and adiponectin play important physiological roles in regulating appetite, food intake, and energy balance and have pathophysiological roles in obesity and anorexia nervosa. To assess the relative contributions of day/night patterns in behaviors (sleep/wake cycle and food intake) and of the endogenous circadian pacemaker on observed day/night patterns of adipokines, in six healthy subjects we measured circulating leptin, soluble leptin receptor, adiponectin, glucose, and insulin levels throughout a constant routine protocol (38 h of wakefulness with constant posture, temperature, and dim light, as well as identical snacks every 2 h) and throughout sleep and fasting periods before and after the constant routine. There were significant endogenous circadian rhythms in leptin, glucose, and insulin, with peaks around the usual time of awakening. Sleep/fasting resulted in additional systematic decreases in leptin, glucose, and insulin, whereas wakefulness/food intake resulted in a systematic increase in leptin. Thus, the day/night pattern in leptin is likely caused by combined effects from the endogenous circadian pacemaker and day/night patterns in behaviors. Our data imply that alterations in the sleep/wake schedule would lead to an increased daily range in circulating leptin, with lowest leptin upon awakening, which, by influencing food intake and energy balance, could be implicated in the increased prevalence of obesity in the shift work population.",

        "Abstract": "There exists a robust day/night pattern in the incidence of adverse cardiac events with a peak at approximately 10 a.m. This peak traditionally has been attributed to day/night patterns in behaviors affecting cardiac function in vulnerable individuals. However, influences from the endogenous circadian pacemaker independent from behaviors may also affect cardiac control. Heartbeat dynamics under healthy conditions exhibit robust complex fluctuations characterized by self-similar temporal structures, which break down under pathologic conditions. We hypothesize that these dynamical features of the healthy human heartbeat have an endogenous circadian rhythm that brings the features closer to those observed under pathologic conditions at the endogenous circadian phase corresponding to approximately 10 a.m. We investigate heartbeat dynamics in healthy subjects recorded throughout a 10-day protocol wherein the sleep/wake and behavior cycles are desynchronized from the endogenous circadian cycle, enabling assessment of circadian factors while controlling for behavior-related factors. We demonstrate that the scaling exponent characterizing temporal correlations in heartbeat dynamics does exhibit a significant circadian rhythm (with a sharp peak at the circadian phase corresponding to approximately 10 a.m.), which is independent from scheduled behaviors and mean heart rate. Cardiac dynamics under pathologic conditions such as congestive heart failure also are associated with a larger value of the scaling exponent of the interbeat interval. Thus, the sharp peak in the scaling exponent at the circadian phase coinciding with the period of highest cardiac vulnerability observed in epidemiological studies suggests that endogenous circadian-mediated influences on cardiac control may be involved in the day/night pattern of adverse cardiac events in vulnerable individuals.",

However, there are significant cognitive and usability barriers. This paper presents a multifaceted cognitive evaluation of the IDEATel diabetes education and telemedicine program. The evaluation included a cognitive walkthrough analysis to characterize task complexity and identify potential problems as well as field usability testing in patients' homes. The study revealed dimensions of the interface that impeded optimal access to system resources. In addition, we found significant obstacles corresponding to perceptual-motoric skills, mental models of the system, and health literacy. The objective of this work is to contribute to a design framework so that participants with a wide range of skills can better manage their chronic illnesses.",
