        "Abstract": "Deep learning methods have recently gained success in detecting left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms. Despite their high level of accuracy, they are difficult to interpret and deploy broadly in the clinical setting. In this study, we set out to determine whether simpler models based on standard ECG measurements could detect LVSD with similar accuracy to that of deep learning models.",

        "Abstract": "Recent artificial intelligence (AI) advancements in cardiovascular care offer potential enhancements in diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. Innovations to date focus on automating measurements, enhancing image quality, and detecting diseases using novel methods. Applications span wearables, electrocardiograms, echocardiography, angiography, genetics, and more. AI models detect diseases from electrocardiograms at accuracy not previously achieved by technology or human experts, including reduced ejection fraction, valvular heart disease, and other cardiomyopathies. However, AI's unique characteristics necessitate rigorous validation by addressing training methods, real-world efficacy, equity concerns, and long-term reliability. Despite an exponentially growing number of studies in cardiovascular AI, trials showing improvement in outcomes remain lacking. A number are currently underway. Embracing this rapidly evolving technology while setting a high evaluation benchmark will be crucial for cardiology to leverage AI to enhance patient care and the provider experience.",

        "Abstract": "Recent artificial intelligence (AI) advancements in cardiovascular care offer potential enhancements in effective diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. More than 600 U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved clinical AI algorithms now exist, with 10% focusing on cardiovascular applications, highlighting the growing opportunities for AI to augment care. This review discusses the latest advancements in the field of AI, with a particular focus on the utilization of multimodal inputs and the field of generative AI. Further discussions in this review involve an approach to understanding the larger context in which AI-augmented care may exist, and include a discussion of the need for rigorous evaluation, appropriate infrastructure for deployment, ethics and equity assessments, regulatory oversight, and viable business cases for deployment. Embracing this rapidly evolving technology while setting an appropriately high evaluation benchmark with careful and patient-centered implementation will be crucial for cardiology to leverage AI to enhance patient care and the provider experience.",

To collectively highlight the most recent advances and benefits of artificial intelligence, computational simulations, and extended reality in cardiovascular therapies, we coined the abbreviation AISER. The review particularly focuses on the following applications of AISER: 1) preprocedural planning and clinical decision making; 2) virtual clinical trials, and cardiovascular device research, development, and regulatory approval; and 3) education and training of interventional health care professionals and medical technology innovators. We also discuss the obstacles and constraints associated with the application of AISER technologies, as well as the proposed solutions. Interventional health care professionals, computer scientists, biomedical engineers, experts in bioinformatics and visualization, the device industry, ethics committees, and regulatory agencies are expected to streamline the use of AISER technologies in cardiovascular interventions and medicine in general.",

        "Abstract": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most frequently performed cardiovascular diagnostic test, but it is unclear how much information resting ECGs contain about long term cardiovascular risk. Here we report that a deep convolutional neural network can accurately predict the long-term risk of cardiovascular mortality and disease based on a resting ECG alone. Using a large dataset of resting 12-lead ECGs collected at Stanford University Medical Center, we developed SEER, the Stanford Estimator of Electrocardiogram Risk. SEER predicts 5-year cardiovascular mortality with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.83 in a held-out test set at Stanford, and with AUCs of 0.78 and 0.83 respectively when independently evaluated at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Columbia University Irving Medical Center. SEER predicts 5-year atherosclerotic disease (ASCVD) with an AUC of 0.67, similar to the Pooled Cohort Equations for ASCVD Risk, while being only modestly correlated. When used in conjunction with the Pooled Cohort Equations, SEER accurately reclassified 16% of patients from low to moderate risk, uncovering a group with an actual average 9.9% 10-year ASCVD risk who would not have otherwise been indicated for statin therapy. SEER can also predict several other cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Using only lead I of the ECG it predicts 5-year cardiovascular mortality with an AUC of 0.80. SEER, used alongside the Pooled Cohort Equations and other risk tools, can substantially improve cardiovascular risk stratification and aid in medical decision making.",

In this study, we systematically examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT, in performing zero-shot medical evidence summarization across six clinical domains. We conduct both automatic and human evaluations, covering several dimensions of summary quality. Our study demonstrates that automatic metrics often do not strongly correlate with the quality of summaries. Furthermore, informed by our human evaluations, we define a terminology of error types for medical evidence summarization.

        "Abstract": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that includes distinct subtypes with different pathophysiologies, genetics, and treatment. Distinguishing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction caused by transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is critical given its specific treatment. We analyzed a single-center retrospective cohort to determine the association of body mass index (BMI) with a composite of either ATTR-CA or the valine-to-isoleucine substitution (Val122Ile) variant genotype (ATTR-CA+Val122Ile). These BMI differences were prospectively evaluated in the multicenter Screening for Cardiac Amyloidosis using nuclear imaging for Minority Populations (SCAN-MP) study of Black and Hispanic patients with heart failure. The association of BMI with ATTR-CA+Val122Ile was compared by Wilcoxon rank sum analysis and combined with age, gender, and maximum left ventricle wall thickness in multivariable logistic regression. In the retrospective analysis (n\u00a0=\u00a0469), ATTR-CA+Val122Ile was identified in n\u00a0=\u00a0198 (40%), who had a lower median BMI (25.8 kg/m",

        "Abstract": "There is growing evidence that COVID-19 can cause cardiovascular complications. However, there are limited data on the characteristics and importance of atrial arrhythmia (AA) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Data from 1,029 patients diagnosed with of COVID-19 and admitted to Columbia University Medical Center between March 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020 were analyzed. The diagnosis of AA was confirmed by 12 lead electrocardiographic recordings, 24-hour telemetry recordings and implantable device interrogations. Patients' history, biomarkers and hospital course were reviewed. Outcomes that were assessed were intubation, discharge and mortality. Of 1,029 patients reviewed, 82 (8%) were diagnosed with AA in whom 46 (56%) were new-onset AA 16 (20%) recurrent paroxysmal and 20 (24%) were chronic persistent AA. Sixty-five percent of the patients diagnosed with AA (n=53) died. Patients diagnosed with AA had significantly higher mortality compared with those without AA (65% vs 21%; p < 0.001). Predictors of mortality were older age (Odds Ratio (OR)=1.12, [95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.04 to 1.22]); male gender (OR=6.4 [95% CI, 1.3 to 32]); azithromycin use (OR=13.4 [95% CI, 2.14 to 84]); and higher D-dimer levels (OR=2.8 [95% CI, 1.1 to 7.3]). In conclusion, patients diagnosed with AA had 3.1 times significant increase in mortality rate versus patients without diagnosis of AA in COVID-19 patients. Older age, male gender, azithromycin use and higher baseline D-dimer levels were predictors of mortality.",

Diagnostic cardiovascular studies may be helpful for resource appropriation and identifying patients at increased risk for death. Methods and Results We analyzed 887 patients (aged 64\u00b117 years) admitted with COVID-19 from March 1 to April 3, 2020 in New York City with 12 lead electrocardiography within 2 days of diagnosis. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory testing, including high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), were abstracted. At 30 days follow-up, 556 patients (63%) were living without requiring mechanical ventilation, 123 (14%) were living and required mechanical ventilation, and 203 (23%) had expired. Electrocardiography findings included atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF/AFL) in 46 (5%) and ST-T wave changes in 306 (38%). 27 (59%) patients with AF/AFL expired as compared to 181 (21%) of 841 with other non-life-threatening rhythms (",

        "Abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can result in a hyperinflammatory state, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), myocardial injury, and thrombotic complications, among other sequelae. Statins, which are known to have anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties, have been studied in the setting of other viral infections and ARDS, but their benefit has not been assessed in COVID-19. Thus, we sought to determine whether antecedent statin use is associated with lower in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. This is a retrospective analysis of patients admitted with COVID-19 from February 1 ",

        "Abstract": "Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood, disproportionately affecting urban, minority, and disadvantaged children. Individualized care plans supported by daily lung-function monitoring can reduce morbidity and mortality. However, despite 20 years of interventions to increase adherence, only 50% of US youth accurately follow their care plans, which leads to millions of preventable hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and sick days every year. We present a feasibility study of a novel, user-centered approach to increasing young people's lung-function monitoring and asthma self-care. Promoting Lung Assessment in Youth (PLAY) helps young people become active managers of their asthma through the Web 2.0 principles of participation, cocreation, and information sharing. Specifically, PLAY combines an inexpensive, portable spirometer with the motivational power and convenience of mobile phones and virtual-community gaming.",
