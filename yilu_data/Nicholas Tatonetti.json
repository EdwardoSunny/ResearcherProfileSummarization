        "Abstract": "Skin cancer mortality rates continue to rise, and survival analysis is increasingly needed to understand who is at risk and what interventions improve outcomes. However, current statistical methods are limited by inability to synthesize multiple data types, such as patient genetics, clinical history, demographics, and pathology and reveal significant multimodal relationships through predictive algorithms. Advances in computing power and data science enabled the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), which synthesizes vast amounts of data and applies algorithms that enable personalized diagnostic approaches. Here, we analyze AI methods used in skin cancer survival analysis, focusing on supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. We illustrate strengths and weaknesses of these approaches with examples. Our PubMed search yielded 14 publications meeting inclusion criteria for this scoping review. Most publications focused on melanoma, particularly histopathologic interpretation with deep learning. Such concentration on a single type of skin cancer amid increasing focus on deep learning highlight growing areas for innovation; however, it also demonstrates opportunity for additional analysis that addresses other types of cutaneous malignancies and expands the scope of prognostication to combine both genetic, histopathologic, and clinical data. Moreover, researchers may leverage multiple AI methods for enhanced benefit in analyses. Expanding AI to this arena may enable improved survival analysis, targeted treatments, and outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "In cancer research, pathology report text is a largely untapped data source. Pathology reports are routinely generated, more nuanced than structured data, and contain added insight from pathologists. However, there are no publicly available datasets for benchmarking report-based models. Two recent advances suggest the urgent need for a benchmark dataset. First, improved optical character recognition (OCR) techniques will make it possible to access older pathology reports in an automated way, increasing the data available for analysis. Second, recent improvements in natural language processing (NLP) techniques using artificial intelligence (AI) allow more accurate prediction of clinical targets from text. We apply state-of-the-art OCR and customized post-processing to report PDFs from The Cancer Genome Atlas, generating a machine-readable corpus of 9,523 reports. Finally, we perform a proof-of-principle cancer-type classification across 32 tissues, achieving 0.992 average AU-ROC. This dataset will be useful to researchers across specialties, including research clinicians, clinical trial investigators, and clinical NLP researchers.",

While genetic studies can highlight potential drug targets, understanding the heritability of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 severity can contextualize their results. To date, loci from meta-analyses explain 1.2% and 5.8%\u00a0of variation in susceptibility and severity\u00a0respectively. Here we estimate the importance of shared environment and additive genetic variation to SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 severity using pedigree data, PCR results, and hospitalization information. The relative importance of genetics and shared environment for susceptibility shifted during the study, with heritability ranging from 33% (95% CI: 20%-46%) to 70% (95% CI: 63%-74%). Heritability was greater for days hospitalized with COVID-19 (41%, 95% CI: 33%-57%) compared to shared environment (33%, 95% CI: 24%-38%). While our estimates suggest these genetic architectures are not fully understood, the shift in susceptibility estimates highlights the challenge of estimation during a pandemic, given environmental fluctuations and vaccine introduction.",

        "Title": "SynTwin: A graph-based approach for predicting clinical outcomes using digital twins derived from synthetic patients.",
        "Abstract": "The concept of a digital twin came from the engineering, industrial, and manufacturing domains to create virtual objects or machines that could inform the design and development of real objects. This idea is appealing for precision medicine where digital twins of patients could help inform healthcare decisions. We have developed a methodology for generating and using digital twins for clinical outcome prediction. We introduce a new approach that combines synthetic data and network science to create digital twins (i.e. SynTwin) for precision medicine. First, our approach starts by estimating the distance between all subjects based on their available features. Second, the distances are used to construct a network with subjects as nodes and edges defining distance less than the percolation threshold. Third, communities or cliques of subjects are defined. Fourth, a large population of synthetic patients are generated using a synthetic data generation algorithm that models the correlation structure of the data to generate new patients. Fifth, digital twins are selected from the synthetic patient population that are within a given distance defining a subject community in the network. Finally, we compare and contrast community-based prediction of clinical endpoints using real subjects, digital twins, or both within and outside of the community. Key to this approach are the digital twins defined using patient similarity that represent hypothetical unobserved patients with patterns similar to nearby real patients as defined by network distance and community structure. We apply our SynTwin approach to predicting mortality in a population-based cancer registry (n=87,674) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program from the National Cancer Institute (USA). Our results demonstrate that nearest network neighbor prediction of mortality in this study is significantly improved with digital twins (AUROC=0.864, 95% CI=0.857-0.872) over just using real data alone (AUROC=0.791, 95% CI=0.781-0.800). These results suggest a network-based digital twin strategy using synthetic patients may add value to precision medicine efforts.",

To date, there have been more than 600 million reported infections worldwide with more than 6 million reported deaths. Retrospective analysis, which identified comorbidities, risk factors, and treatments, has underpinned the response. As the situation transitions to an endemic, retrospective analyses using electronic health records will be important to identify the long-term effects of COVID-19. However, these analyses can be complicated by incomplete records, which makes it difficult to differentiate visits where the patient had COVID-19. To address this issue, we trained a random Forest classifier to assign a probability of a patient having been diagnosed with COVID-19 during each visit. Using these probabilities, we found that higher COVID-19 probabilities were associated with a future diagnosis of myocardial infarction, urinary tract infection, acute renal failure, and type 2 diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "Opportunities to improve the clinical management of skin disease are being created by advances in genomic medicine. Large-scale sequencing increasingly challenges notions about single-gene disorders. It is now apparent that monogenic etiologies make appreciable contributions to the population burden of disease and that they are underrecognized in clinical practice. A genetic diagnosis informs on molecular pathology and may direct targeted treatments and tailored prevention strategies for patients and family members. It also generates knowledge about disease pathogenesis and management that is relevant to patients without rare pathogenic variants. Inborn errors of immunity are a large class of monogenic etiologies that have been well-studied and contribute to the population burden of inflammatory diseases. To further delineate the contributions of inborn errors of immunity to the pathogenesis of skin disease, we performed a set of analyses that identified 316 inborn errors of immunity associated with skin pathologies, including common skin diseases. These data suggest that clinical sequencing is underutilized in dermatology. We next use these data to derive a network that illuminates the molecular relationships of these disorders and suggests an underlying etiological organization to immune-mediated skin disease. Our results motivate the further development of a molecularly derived and data-driven reorganization of clinical diagnoses of skin disease.",

        "Abstract": "In cancer research, pathology report text is a largely un-tapped data source. Pathology reports are routinely generated, more nuanced than structured data, and contain added insight from pathologists. However, there are no publicly-available datasets for benchmarking report-based models. Two recent advances suggest the urgent need for a benchmark dataset. First, improved optical character recognition (OCR) techniques will make it possible to access older pathology reports in an automated way, increasing data available for analysis. Second, recent improvements in natural language processing (NLP) techniques using AI allow more accurate prediction of clinical targets from text. We apply state-of-the-art OCR and customized post-processing to publicly available report PDFs from The Cancer Genome Atlas, generating a machine-readable corpus of 9,523 reports. We perform a proof-of-principle cancer-type classification across 32 tissues, achieving 0.992 average AU-ROC. This dataset will be useful to researchers across specialties, including research clinicians, clinical trial investigators, and clinical NLP researchers.",

We have designed and validated a new platform-named VenomSeq-to systematically identify putative associations between venoms and drugs/diseases via high-throughput transcriptomics and perturbational differential gene expression analysis. In this study, we describe the architecture of VenomSeq and its evaluation using the crude venoms from 25 diverse animal species and 9 purified teretoxin peptides. By integrating comparisons to public repositories of differential expression, associations between regulatory networks and disease, and existing knowledge of venom activity, we provide a number of new therapeutic hypotheses linking venoms to human diseases supported by multiple layers of preliminary evidence.",

In this editorial, we discuss this technology from the academic's perspective with regard to its limitations and utility for academic writing, education, and programming. We end with our stance with regard to using LLMs and chatbots in academia, which is summarized as (1) we must find ways to effectively use them, (2) their use does not constitute plagiarism (although they may produce plagiarized text), (3) we must quantify their bias, (4) users must be cautious of their poor accuracy, and (5) the future is bright for their application to research and as an academic tool.",

However, it is not routinely recorded in structured electronic health records. Here, we present a generalizable method for the automated classification of TNM stage directly from pathology report text. We train a BERT-based model using publicly available pathology reports across approximately 7,000 patients and 23 cancer types. We explore the use of different model types, with differing input sizes, parameters, and model architectures. Our final model goes beyond term-extraction, inferring TNM stage from context when it is not included in the report text explicitly. As external validation, we test our model on almost 8,000 pathology reports from Columbia University Medical Center, finding that our trained model achieved an AU-ROC of 0.815-0.942. This suggests that our model can be applied broadly to other institutions without additional institution-specific fine-tuning.",

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the deadliest cancers. Developing biomarkers for chemotherapeutic response prediction is crucial for improving the dismal prognosis of advanced-PC patients (pts). To evaluate the potential of plasma metabolites as predictors of the response to chemotherapy for PC patients, we analyzed plasma metabolites using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry from 31 cachectic, advanced-PC subjects enrolled into the PANCAX-1 (NCT02400398) prospective trial to receive a jejunal tube peptide-based diet for 12 weeks and who were planned for palliative chemotherapy. Overall, there were statistically significant differences in the levels of intermediates of multiple metabolic pathways in pts with a partial response (PR)/stable disease (SD) vs. progressive disease (PD) to chemotherapy. When stratified by the chemotherapy regimen, PD after 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (e.g., FOLFIRINOX) was associated with decreased levels of amino acids (AAs). For gemcitabine-based chemotherapy (e.g., gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel), PD was associated with increased levels of intermediates of glycolysis, the TCA cycle, nucleoside synthesis, and bile acid metabolism. These results demonstrate the feasibility of plasma metabolomics in a prospective cohort of advanced-PC patients for assessing the effect of enteral feeding as their primary source of nutrition. Metabolic signatures unique to FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel may be predictive of a patient's response and warrant further study.",

        "Abstract": "Few computational approaches exist for abstracting electronic health record (EHR) log files into clinically meaningful phenomena like clinician shifts. Because shifts are a fundamental unit of work recognized in clinical settings, shifts may serve as a primary unit of analysis in the study of documentation burden. We conducted a proof- of-concept study to investigate the feasibility of a novel approach using time series clustering to segment and infer clinician shifts from EHR log files. From 33,535,585 events captured between April-June 2021, we computationally identified 43,911 potential shifts among 2,285 (74.2%) emergency department nurses. On average, computationally-identified shifts were 10.6\u00b13.1 hours long. Based on data distributions, we classified these shifts based on type: day, evening, night; and length: 12-hour, 8-hour, other. We validated our method through manual chart review of computationally-identified 12-hour shifts achieving 92.0% accuracy. Preliminary results suggest unsupervised clustering methods may be a reasonable approach for rapidly identifying clinician shifts.",

        "Abstract": "The high-dimensionality, complexity, and irregularity of electronic health records (EHR) data create significant challenges for both simplified and comprehensive health assessments, prohibiting an efficient extraction of actionable insights by clinicians. If we can provide human decision-makers with a simplified set of interpretable composite indices (i.e., combining information about groups of related measures into single representative values), it will facilitate effective clinical decision-making. In this study, we built a structured deep embedding model aimed at reducing the dimensionality of the input variables by grouping related measurements as determined by domain experts (e.g., clinicians). Our results suggest that composite indices representing liver function may consistently be the most important factor in the early detection of pancreatic cancer (PC). We propose our model as a basis for leveraging deep learning toward developing composite indices from EHR for predicting health outcomes, including but not limited to various cancers, with clinically meaningful interpretations.",

While biomedical research questions are usually answered in terms of how a method performs in a particular context, we argue that it is equally important to consider and formally evaluate the ethical implications of informatics solutions. Several new research paradigms have arisen as a result of the consideration of ethical issues, including but not limited for privacy-preserving computation and fair machine learning. In the spirit of the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, we discuss broad and fundamental principles of ethical biomedical informatics in terms of Olelo Noeau, or Hawaiian proverbs and poetical sayings that capture Hawaiian values. While we emphasize issues related to privacy and fairness in particular, there are a multitude of facets to ethical biomedical informatics that can benefit from a critical analysis grounded in ethics.",

        "Abstract": "Neurovascular unit and barrier maturation rely on vascular basement membrane (vBM) composition. Laminins, a major vBM component, are crucial for these processes, yet the signaling pathway(s) that regulate their expression remain unknown. Here, we show that mural cells have active Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling during central nervous system development in mice. Bulk RNA sequencing and validation using postnatal day 10 and 14 wild-type versus adenomatosis polyposis coli downregulated 1 (Apcdd1-/-) mouse retinas revealed that Lama2 mRNA and protein levels are increased in mutant vasculature with higher Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Mural cells are the main source of Lama2, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activation induces Lama2 expression in mural cells in vitro. Markers of mature astrocytes, including aquaporin 4 (a water channel in astrocyte endfeet) and integrin-\u03b16 (a laminin receptor), are upregulated in Apcdd1-/- retinas with higher Lama2 vBM deposition. Thus, the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway regulates Lama2 expression in mural cells to promote neurovascular unit and barrier maturation.",

        "Abstract": "Heart transplantation remains the definitive treatment for end stage heart failure. Because availability is limited, risk stratification of candidates is crucial for optimizing both organ allocations and transplant outcomes. Here we utilize proteomics prior to transplant to identify new biomarkers that predict post-transplant survival in a multi-institutional cohort. Microvesicles were isolated from serum samples and underwent proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry. Monte Carlo cross-validation (MCCV) was used to predict survival after transplant incorporating select recipient pre-transplant clinical characteristics and serum microvesicle proteomic data. We identified six protein markers with prediction performance above AUROC of 0.6, including Prothrombin (F2), anti-plasmin (SERPINF2), Factor IX, carboxypeptidase 2 (CPB2), HGF activator (HGFAC) and low molecular weight kininogen (LK). No clinical characteristics demonstrated an AUROC\u2009>\u20090.6. Putative biological functions and pathways were assessed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Differential expression analysis identified enriched pathways prior to transplant that were associated with post-transplant survival including activation of platelets and the coagulation pathway prior to transplant. Specifically, upregulation of coagulation cascade components of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) and downregulation of kininogen prior to transplant were associated with survival after transplant. Further prospective studies are warranted to determine if alterations in the KKS contributes to overall post-transplant survival.",

        "Abstract": "The multi-modal and unstructured nature of observational data in Electronic Health Records (EHR) is currently a significant obstacle for the application of machine learning towards risk stratification. In this study, we develop a deep learning framework for incorporating longitudinal clinical data from EHR to infer risk for pancreatic cancer (PC). This framework includes a novel training protocol, which enforces an emphasis on early detection by applying an independent Poisson-random mask on proximal-time measurements for each variable. Data fusion for irregular multivariate time-series features is enabled by a \"grouped\" neural network (GrpNN) architecture, which uses representation learning to generate a dimensionally reduced vector for each measurement set before making a final prediction. These models were evaluated using EHR data from Columbia University Irving Medical Center-New York Presbyterian Hospital. Our framework demonstrated better performance on early detection (AUROC 0.671, CI 95% 0.667 - 0.675, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) at 12\u00a0months prior to diagnosis compared to a logistic regression, xgboost, and a feedforward neural network baseline. We demonstrate that our masking strategy results greater improvements at distal times prior to diagnosis, and that our GrpNN model improves generalizability by reducing overfitting relative to the feedforward baseline. The results were consistent across reported race. Our proposed algorithm is potentially generalizable to other diseases including but not limited to cancer where early detection can improve survival.",

To address these challenges, we combine transcriptional profiling of 646 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs and 39 patient autopsy tissues to define body-wide transcriptome changes in response to COVID-19. We then match these data with spatial protein and expression profiling across 357 tissue sections from 16 representative patient lung samples and identify tissue-compartment-specific damage wrought by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, evident as a function of varying viral loads during the clinical course of infection and tissue-type-specific expression states. Overall, our findings reveal a systemic disruption of canonical cellular and transcriptional pathways across all tissues, which can inform subsequent studies to combat the mortality of COVID-19 and to better understand the molecular dynamics of lethal SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections.",

        "Abstract": "The current strategy to detect acute injury of kidney tubular cells relies on changes in serum levels of creatinine. Yet serum creatinine (sCr) is a marker of both functional and pathological processes and does not adequately assay tubular injury. In addition, sCr may require days to reach diagnostic thresholds, yet tubular cells respond with programs of damage and repair within minutes or hours. To detect acute responses to clinically relevant stimuli, we created mice expressing Rosa26-floxed-stop uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (Uprt) and inoculated 4-thiouracil (4-TU) to tag nascent RNA at selected time points. Cre-driven 4-TU-tagged RNA was isolated from intact kidneys and demonstrated that volume depletion and ischemia induced different genetic programs in collecting ducts and intercalated cells. Even lineage-related cell types expressed different genes in response to the 2 stressors. TU tagging also demonstrated the transient nature of the responses. Because we placed Uprt in the ubiquitously active Rosa26 locus, nascent RNAs from many cell types can be tagged in vivo and their roles interrogated under various conditions. In short, 4-TU labeling identifies stimulus-specific, cell-specific, and time-dependent acute responses that are otherwise difficult to detect with other technologies and are entirely obscured when sCr is the sole metric of kidney damage.",

        "Abstract": "Data-driven characterization of symptom clusters in chronic conditions is essential for shared cluster detection and physiological mechanism discovery. This study aims to computationally describe symptom documentation from electronic nursing notes and compare symptom clusters among patients diagnosed with four chronic conditions-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cancer. Nursing notes (N\u2009=\u2009504,395; 133,977 patients) were obtained for the 2016 calendar year from a single medical center. We used NimbleMiner, a natural language processing application, to identify the presence of 56 symptoms. We calculated symptom documentation prevalence by note and patient for the corpus. Then, we visually compared documentation for a subset of patients (N\u2009=\u200922,657) diagnosed with COPD (n\u2009=\u20093339), heart failure (n\u2009=\u20096587), diabetes (n\u2009=\u200912,139), and cancer (n\u2009=\u20097269) and conducted multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering to discover underlying groups of patients who have similar symptom profiles (i.e., symptom clusters) for each condition. As expected, pain was the most frequently documented symptom. All conditions had a group of patients characterized by no symptoms. Shared clusters included cardiovascular symptoms for heart failure and diabetes; pain and other symptoms for COPD, diabetes, and cancer; and a newly-identified cognitive and neurological symptom cluster for heart failure, diabetes, and cancer. Cancer (gastrointestinal symptoms and fatigue) and COPD (mental health symptoms) each contained a unique cluster. In summary, we report both shared and distinct, as well as established and novel, symptom clusters across chronic conditions. Findings support the use of electronic health record-derived notes and NLP methods to study symptoms and symptom clusters to advance symptom science.",

        "Abstract": "Identifying adverse drugs effects (ADEs) in children, overall and within pediatric age groups, is essential for preventing disability and death from marketed drugs. At the same time, however, detection is challenging due to dynamic biological processes during growth and maturation, called ontogeny, that alter pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. As a result, methodologies in pediatric drug safety have been limited to event surveillance and have not focused on investigating adverse event mechanisms. There is an opportunity to identify drug event patterns within observational databases for evaluating ontogenic-mediated adverse event mechanisms. The first step of which is to establish statistical models that can identify temporal trends of adverse effects across childhood.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents a slowly progressive disorder that is typically silent until late stages, but early intervention can significantly delay its progression. We designed a portable and scalable electronic CKD phenotype to facilitate early disease recognition and empower large-scale observational and genetic studies of kidney traits. The algorithm uses a combination of rule-based and machine-learning methods to automatically place patients on the staging grid of albuminuria by glomerular filtration rate (\"A-by-G\" grid). We manually validated the algorithm by 451 chart reviews across three medical systems, demonstrating overall positive predictive value of 95% for CKD cases and 97% for healthy controls. Independent case-control validation using 2350 patient records demonstrated diagnostic specificity of 97% and sensitivity of 87%. Application of the phenotype to 1.3 million patients demonstrated that over 80% of CKD cases are undetected using ICD codes alone. We also demonstrated several large-scale applications of the phenotype, including identifying stage-specific kidney disease comorbidities, in silico estimation of kidney trait heritability in thousands of pedigrees reconstructed from medical records, and biobank-based multicenter genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies.",

        "Abstract": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has infected over 115 million people and caused over 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19, as well as what distinguishes them from common seasonal influenza virus and other lung injury states such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), remains poorly understood. To address these challenges, we combined transcriptional profiling of 646 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs and 39 patient autopsy tissues, matched with spatial protein and expression profiling (GeoMx) across 357 tissue sections. These results define both body-wide and tissue-specific (heart, liver, lung, kidney, and lymph nodes) damage wrought by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, evident as a function of varying viral load (high vs. low) during the course of infection and specific, transcriptional dysregulation in splicing isoforms, T cell receptor expression, and cellular expression states. In particular, cardiac and lung tissues revealed the largest degree of splicing isoform switching and cell expression state loss. Overall, these findings reveal a systemic disruption of cellular and transcriptional pathways from COVID-19 across all tissues, which can inform subsequent studies to combat the mortality of COVID-19, as well to better understand the molecular dynamics of lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection and other viruses.",

        "Abstract": "Allograft rejection following heart transplantation (HTx) is a serious complication even in the era of modern immunosuppressive regimens and causes up to a third of early deaths after HTx. Allograft rejection is mediated by a cascade of immune mechanisms leading to acute cellular rejection (ACR) and/or antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). The gold standard for monitoring allograft rejection is invasive endomyocardial biopsy that exposes patients to complications. Little is known about the potential of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers to detect cardiac allograft rejection. We here present a systematic analysis of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers and predictors for allograft rejection after HTx using next-generation small RNA sequencing.",

        "Abstract": "In less than nine months, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) killed over a million people, including >25,000 in New York City (NYC) alone. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 highlights clinical needs to detect infection, track strain evolution, and identify biomarkers of disease course. To address these challenges, we designed a fast (30-minute) colorimetric test (LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection from naso/oropharyngeal swabs and a large-scale shotgun metatranscriptomics platform (total-RNA-seq) for host, viral, and microbial profiling. We applied these methods to clinical specimens gathered from 669 patients in New York City during the first two months of the outbreak, yielding a broad molecular portrait of the emerging COVID-19 disease. We find significant enrichment of a NYC-distinctive clade of the virus (20C), as well as host responses in interferon, ACE, hematological, and olfaction pathways. In addition, we use 50,821 patient records to find that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors have a protective effect for severe COVID-19 outcomes, unlike similar drugs. Finally, spatial transcriptomic data from COVID-19 patient autopsy tissues reveal distinct ACE2 expression loci, with macrophage and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs. These findings can inform public health and may help develop and drive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic, prevention, and treatment strategies.",

        "Abstract": "Adverse drugs effects (ADEs) in children are common and may result in disability and death. The current paediatric drug safety landscape, including clinical trials, is limited as it rarely includes children and relies on extrapolation from adults. Children are not small adults but go through an evolutionarily conserved and physiologically dynamic process of growth and maturation. Novel quantitative approaches, integrating observations from clinical trials and drug safety databases with dynamic mechanisms, can be used to systematically identify ADEs unique to childhood. In this perspective, we discuss three critical research directions using systems biology methodologies and novel informatics to improve paediatric drug safety, namely child versus adult drug safety profiles, age-dependent drug toxicities and genetic susceptibility of ADEs across childhood. We argue that a data-driven framework that leverages observational data, biomedical knowledge and systems biology modelling will reveal previously unknown mechanisms of pediatric adverse drug events and lead to improved paediatric drug safety.",

Recent evidence suggests blood type may affect risk of severe COVID-19. Here, we use observational healthcare data on 14,112 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 with known blood type in the New York Presbyterian (NYP) hospital system to assess the association between ABO and Rh blood types and infection, intubation, and death. We find slightly increased infection prevalence among non-O types. Risk of intubation was decreased among A and increased among AB and B types, compared with type O, while risk of death was increased for type AB and decreased for types A and B. We estimate Rh-negative blood type to have a protective effect for all three outcomes. Our results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting blood type may play a role in COVID-19.",

        "Abstract": "Adverse drug reactions are the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Although women take longer to metabolize medications and experience twice the risk of developing adverse reactions compared with men, these sex differences are not comprehensively understood. Real-world clinical data provide an opportunity to estimate safety effects in otherwise understudied populations, i.e., women. These data, however, are subject to confounding biases and correlated covariates. We present AwareDX, a pharmacovigilance algorithm that leverages advances in machine learning to predict sex risks. Our algorithm mitigates these biases and quantifies the differential risk of a drug causing an adverse event in either men or women. AwareDX demonstrates high precision during validation against clinical literature and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. We present a resource of 20,817 adverse drug effects posing sex-specific risks. AwareDX, and this resource, present an opportunity to minimize adverse events by tailoring drug prescription and dosage to sex.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for therapeutic and public health strategies. Viral-host interactions can guide discovery of disease regulators, and protein structure function analysis points to several immune pathways, including complement and coagulation, as targets of coronaviruses. To determine whether conditions associated with dysregulated complement or coagulation systems impact disease, we performed a retrospective observational study and found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for complement-activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis and hemorrhage) are risk factors for SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity and mortality-effects that are independent of age, sex or history of smoking. Transcriptional profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs demonstrated that in addition to type-I interferon and interleukin-6-dependent inflammatory responses, infection results in robust engagement of the complement and coagulation pathways. Finally, in a candidate-driven genetic association study of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, we identified putative complement and coagulation-associated loci including missense, eQTL and sQTL variants of critical complement and coagulation regulators. In addition to providing evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to putative transcriptional genetic markers of susceptibility. The results highlight the value of using a multimodal analytical approach to reveal determinants and predictors of immunity, susceptibility and clinical outcome associated with infection.",

Recent evidence suggests blood type may affect risk of severe COVID-19. We used observational healthcare data on 14,112 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 with known blood type in the New York Presbyterian (NYP) hospital system to assess the association between ABO and Rh blood types and infection, intubation, and death. We found slightly increased infection prevalence among non-O types. Risk of intubation was decreased among A and increased among AB and B types, compared with type O, while risk of death was increased for type AB and decreased for types A and B. We estimated Rh-negative blood type to have a protective effect for all three outcomes. Our results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting blood type may play a role in COVID-19.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for therapeutics and public health intervention strategies. Viral-host interactions can guide discovery of regulators of disease outcomes, and protein structure function analysis points to several immune pathways, including complement and coagulation, as targets of the coronavirus proteome. To determine if conditions associated with dysregulation of the complement or coagulation systems impact adverse clinical outcomes, we performed a retrospective observational study of 11,116 patients who presented with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for complement activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and hemorrhage) are risk factors for morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients - effects that could not be explained by age, sex, or history of smoking. Further, transcriptional profiling of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 650 control and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients demonstrated that in addition to innate Type-I interferon and IL-6 dependent inflammatory immune responses, infection results in robust engagement and activation of the complement and coagulation pathways. Finally, we conducted a candidate driven genetic association study of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease. Among the findings, our scan identified putative complement and coagulation associated loci including missense, eQTL and sQTL variants of critical regulators of the complement and coagulation cascades. In addition to providing evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to putative transcriptional genetic markers of susceptibility. The results highlight the value of using a multi-modal analytical approach, combining molecular information from virus protein structure-function analysis with clinical informatics, transcriptomics, and genomics to reveal determinants and predictors of immunity, susceptibility, and clinical outcome associated with infection.",

        "Abstract": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused thousands of deaths worldwide, including >18,000 in New York City (NYC) alone. The sudden emergence of this pandemic has highlighted a pressing clinical need for rapid, scalable diagnostics that can detect infection, interrogate strain evolution, and identify novel patient biomarkers. To address these challenges, we designed a fast (30-minute) colorimetric test (LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection from naso/oropharyngeal swabs, plus a large-scale shotgun metatranscriptomics platform (total-RNA-seq) for host, bacterial, and viral profiling. We applied both technologies across 857 SARS-CoV-2 clinical specimens and 86 NYC subway samples, providing a broad molecular portrait of the COVID-19 NYC outbreak. Our results define new features of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, nominate a novel, NYC-enriched viral subclade, reveal specific host responses in interferon, ACE, hematological, and olfaction pathways, and examine risks associated with use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Together, these findings have immediate applications to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, public health, and new therapeutic targets.",

Phenotypic polymyxin susceptibility testing is resource intensive and difficult to perform accurately. The complex polygenic nature of PR and our incomplete understanding of its genetic basis make it difficult to predict PR using detection of resistance determinants.

In this paper, we evaluate the use of genomic test reports ordered for cancer patients in order to derive cancer subtypes and to identify biological pathways predictive of poor survival outcomes. A novel method is proposed to calculate patient similarity based on affected biological pathways rather than gene mutations. We demonstrate that this approach identifies subtypes of prognostic value and biological pathways linked to survival, with implications for precision treatment selection and a better understanding of the underlying disease. We also share lessons learned regarding the opportunities and challenges of secondary use of observational genomic data to conduct such research.",

        "Abstract": "The acute loss of kidney function has been diagnosed for many decades using the serum concentration of creatinine - a muscle metabolite that is an insensitive and non-specific marker of kidney function, but is now used for the very definition of acute kidney injury (AKI). Fortunately, myriad new tools have now been developed to better understand the relationship between acute tubular injury and elevation in serum creatinine (SCr). These tools include unbiased gene and protein expression analyses in kidney, urine and blood, the localization of specific gene transcripts in pathological biopsy samples by rapid in-situ RNA technology and single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses. However, this molecular approach to AKI has produced a series of unexpected problems, because the expression of specific kidney-derived molecules that are indicative of injury often do not correlate with SCr levels. This discrepancy between kidney injury markers and SCr level can be reconciled by the recognition that many separate subtypes of AKI exist, each with distinct patterning of molecular markers of tubular injury and SCr data. In this Review, we describe the weaknesses of isolated SCr-based diagnoses, the clinical and molecular subtyping of acute tubular injury, and the role of non-invasive biomarkers in clinical phenotyping. We propose a conceptual model that synthesizes molecular and physiological data along a time course spanning from acute cellular injury to organ failure.",

        "Abstract": "Interventional pharmacology is one of medicine's most potent weapons against disease. These drugs, however, can result in damaging side effects and must be closely monitored. Pharmacovigilance is the field of science that monitors, detects, and prevents adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Safety efforts begin during the development process, using in vivo and in vitro studies, continue through clinical trials, and extend to postmarketing surveillance of ADRs in real-world populations. Future toxicity and safety challenges, including increased polypharmacy and patient diversity, stress the limits of these traditional tools. Massive amounts of newly available data present an opportunity for using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to improve drug safety science. Here, we explore recent advances as applied to preclinical drug safety and postmarketing surveillance with a specific focus on machine and deep learning (DL) approaches.",

        "Abstract": "The discovery of new pharmaceutical drugs is one of the preeminent tasks-scientifically, economically, and socially-in biomedical research. Advances in informatics and computational biology have increased productivity at many stages of the drug discovery pipeline. Nevertheless, drug discovery has slowed, largely due to the reliance on small molecules as the primary source of novel hypotheses. Natural products (such as plant metabolites, animal toxins, and immunological components) comprise a vast and diverse source of bioactive compounds, some of which are supported by thousands of years of traditional medicine, and are largely disjoint from the set of small molecules used commonly for discovery. However, natural products possess unique characteristics that distinguish them from traditional small molecule drug candidates, requiring new methods and approaches for assessing their therapeutic potential. In this review, we investigate a number of state-of-the-art techniques in bioinformatics, cheminformatics, and knowledge engineering for data-driven drug discovery from natural products. We focus on methods that aim to bridge the gap between traditional small-molecule drug candidates and different classes of natural products. We also explore the current informatics knowledge gaps and other barriers that need to be overcome to fully leverage these compounds for drug discovery. Finally, we conclude with a \"road map\" of research priorities that seeks to realize this goal.",

        "Abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, and abnormal blood glucose is an important risk factor. Delayed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus can increase patients' morbidity. In an urban academic medical center with a large clinical data warehouse, we used a novel algorithm to identify 56,794 family members of diabetic patients that were eligible for disease screening. We found that 30.6% of patients did not receive diabetes screening as recommended by current guidelines. Further, our analysis showed that having more than one family member affected and being a female were important contributors to being screened for diabetes mellitus. This study demonstrates that informatics methods applied to electronic health record data can be used to identify patients at risk for disease development, and therefore support clinical care.",

COHD was derived from Columbia University Irving Medical Center's Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) database. The lifetime dataset, derived from all records, contains 36,578 single concepts (11,952 conditions, 12,334 drugs, and 10,816 procedures) and 32,788,901 concept pairs from 5,364,781 patients. The 5-year dataset, derived from records from 2013-2017, contains 29,964 single concepts (10,159 conditions, 10,264 drugs, and 8,270 procedures) and 15,927,195 concept pairs from 1,790,431 patients. Exclusion of rare concepts (count\u2009\u2264\u200910) and Poisson randomization enable data sharing by eliminating risks to patient privacy. EHR prevalences are informative of healthcare consumption rates. Analysis of co-occurrence frequencies via relative frequency analysis and observed-expected frequency ratio are informative of associations between clinical concepts, useful for biomedical research tasks such as drug repurposing and pharmacovigilance. COHD is publicly accessible through a web application-programming interface (API) and downloadable from the Figshare repository. The code is available on GitHub.",

        "Abstract": "Worldwide, over 14% of individuals hospitalized for psychiatric reasons have readmissions to hospitals within 30\u00a0days after discharge. Predicting patients at risk and leveraging accelerated interventions can reduce the rates of early readmission, a negative clinical outcome (i.e., a treatment failure) that affects the quality of life of patient. To implement individualized interventions, it is necessary to predict those individuals at highest risk for 30-day readmission. In this study, our aim was to conduct a data-driven investigation to find the pharmacological factors influencing 30-day all-cause, intra- and interdepartmental readmissions after an index psychiatric admission, using the compendium of prescription data (prescriptome) from electronic medical records (EMR).",

        "Abstract": "Hospitalized patients are at risk for increased length of stay, illness, or death due to hospital acquired infections. The majority of hospital transmission models describe dynamics on the level of the host rather than on the level of the pathogens themselves. Accordingly, epidemiologists often cannot complete transmission chains without direct evidence of either host-host contact or a large reservoir population. Here, we propose an ecology-based model to explain the transmission of pathogens in hospitals. The model is based upon metapopulation biology, which describes a group of interacting localized populations and island biogeography, which provides a basis for how pathogens may be moving between locales. Computational simulation trials are used to assess the applicability of the model. Results indicate that pathogens survive for extended periods without the need for large reservoirs by living in localized ephemeral populations while continuously transmitting pathogens to new seed populations. Computational simulations show small populations spending significant portions of time at sizes too small to be detected by most surveillance protocols and that the number and type of these ephemeral populations enable the overall pathogen population to be sustained. By modeling hospital pathogens as a metapopulation, many observations characteristic of hospital acquired infection outbreaks for which there has previously been no sufficient biological explanation, including how and why empirically successful interventions work, can now be accounted for using population dynamic hypotheses. Epidemiological links between temporally isolated outbreaks are explained via pathogen population dynamics and potential outbreak intervention targets are identified.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the downstream consequences of pharmacologically targeted proteins is essential to drug design. Current approaches investigate molecular effects under tissue-na\u00efve assumptions. Many target proteins, however, have tissue-specific expression. A systematic study connecting drugs to target pathways in in vivo human tissues is needed. We introduced a data-driven method that integrates drug-target relationships with gene expression, protein-protein interaction, and pathway annotation data. We applied our method to four independent genomewide expression datasets and built 467,396 connections between 1,034 drugs and 954 pathways in 259 human tissues or cell lines. We validated our results using data from L1000 and Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB), and observed high precision and recall. We predicted and tested anticoagulant effects of 22 compounds experimentally that were previously unknown, and used clinical data to validate these effects retrospectively. Our systematic study provides a better understanding of the cellular response to drugs and can be applied to many research topics in systems pharmacology.",

Electronic health records (EHRs) passively capture a wide range of clinically relevant data and provide a resource for studying the heritability of traits that are not typically accessible. EHRs contain next-of-kin information collected via patient emergency contact forms, but until now, these data have gone unused in research. We mined emergency contact data at three academic medical centers and identified 7.4 million familial relationships while maintaining patient privacy. Identified relationships were consistent with genetically derived relatedness. We used EHR data to compute heritability estimates for 500 disease phenotypes. Overall, estimates were consistent with the literature and between sites. Inconsistencies were indicative of limitations and opportunities unique to EHR research. These analyses provide a validation of the use of EHRs for genetics and disease research.",

We must ascribe to a new way of conducting research that has the efficiency of a retrospective analysis and the rigor of a prospective trial. This can be achieved by integrating observational data from humans with laboratory experiments in model systems. The former establishes clinical significance and the latter supports causality.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to collect, store and analyze massive amounts of molecular and clinical data is fundamentally transforming the scientific method and its application in translational medicine. Collecting observations has always been a prerequisite for discovery, and great leaps in scientific understanding are accompanied by an expansion of this ability. Particle physics, astronomy and climate science, for example, have all greatly benefited from the development of new technologies enabling the collection of larger and more diverse data. Unlike medicine, however, each of these fields also has a mature theoretical framework on which new data can be evaluated and incorporated-to say it another way, there are no 'first principals' from which a healthy human could be analytically derived. The worry, and it is a valid concern, is that, without a strong theoretical underpinning, the inundation of data will cause medical research to devolve into a haphazard enterprise without discipline or rigor. The Age of Big Data harbors tremendous opportunity for biomedical advances, but will also be treacherous and demanding on future scientists.",

        "Abstract": "Many drugs commonly prescribed during pregnancy lack a fetal safety recommendation - called FDA 'category C' drugs. This study aims to classify these drugs into harmful and safe categories using knowledge gained from chemoinformatics (i.e., pharmacological similarity with drugs of known fetal effect) and empirical data (i.e., derived from Electronic Health Records). Our fetal loss cohort contains 14,922 affected and 33,043 unaffected pregnancies and our congenital anomalies cohort contains 5,658 affected and 31,240 unaffected infants. We trained a random forest to classify drugs of unknown pregnancy class into harmful or safe categories, focusing on two distinct outcomes: fetal loss and congenital anomalies. Our models achieved an out-of-bag accuracy of 91% for fetal loss and 87% for congenital anomalies outperforming null models. Fifty-seven 'category C' medications were classified as harmful for fetal loss and eleven for congenital anomalies. This includes medications with documented harmful effects, including naproxen, ibuprofen and rubella live vaccine. We also identified several novel drugs, e.g., haloperidol, that increased the risk of fetal loss. Our approach provides important information on the harmfulness of 'category C' drugs. This is needed, as no FDA recommendation exists for these drugs' fetal safety.",

        "Title": "Procedure prediction from symbolic Electronic Health Records via time intervals analytics.",
        "Abstract": "Prediction of medical events, such as clinical procedures, is essential for preventing disease, understanding disease mechanism, and increasing patient quality of care. Although longitudinal clinical data from Electronic Health Records provides opportunities to develop predictive models, the use of these data faces significant challenges. Primarily, while the data are longitudinal and represent thousands of conceptual events having duration, they are also sparse, complicating the application of traditional analysis approaches. Furthermore, the framework presented here takes advantage of the events duration and gaps. International standards for electronic healthcare data represent data elements, such as procedures, conditions, and drug exposures, using eras, or time intervals. Such eras contain both an event and a duration and enable the application of time intervals mining - a relatively new subfield of data mining. In this study, we present Maitreya, a framework for time intervals analytics in longitudinal clinical data. Maitreya discovers frequent time intervals related patterns (TIRPs), which we use as prognostic markers for modelling clinical events. We introduce three novel TIRP metrics that are normalized versions of the horizontal-support, that represents the number of TIRP instances per patient. We evaluate Maitreya on 28 frequent and clinically important procedures, using the three novel TIRP representation metrics in comparison to no temporal representation and previous TIRPs metrics. We also evaluate the epsilon value that makes Allen's relations more flexible with several settings of 30, 60, 90 and 180days in comparison to the default zero. For twenty-two of these procedures, the use of temporal patterns as predictors was superior to non-temporal features, and the use of the vertically normalized horizontal support metric to represent TIRPs as features was most effective. The use of the epsilon value with thirty days was slightly better than the zero.",

Exosomes are actively assembled and carry messenger RNAs, microRNAs and proteins. The \"gold standard\" for cardiac allograft surveillance is endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), an invasive technique with a distinct complication profile. The development of novel, non-invasive methods for the early diagnosis of allograft rejection is warranted. We hypothesized that the exosomal proteome is altered in acute rejection, allowing for a distinction between non-rejection and rejection episodes.",

        "Abstract": "Climate is a known modulator of disease, but its impact on hospital performance metrics remains unstudied. We assess the relationship between K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification and hospital performance metrics, specifically 30-day mortality, as reported in Hospital Compare, and collected for the period July 2013 through June 2014 (7/1/2013-06/30/2014). A hospital-level multivariate linear regression analysis was performed while controlling for known socioeconomic factors to explore the relationship between all-cause mortality and climate. Hospital performance scores were obtained from 4,524 hospitals belonging to 15 distinct K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climates and 2,373 unique counties. Model results revealed that hospital performance metrics for mortality showed significant climate dependence (p\u2009<\u20090.001) after adjusting for socioeconomic factors. Climate is a significant factor in evaluating hospital 30-day mortality rates. These results demonstrate that climate classification is an important factor when comparing hospital performance across the United States.",

        "Abstract": "Integrating multiple sources of pharmacovigilance evidence has the potential to advance the science of safety signal detection and evaluation. In this regard, there is a need for more research on how to integrate multiple disparate evidence sources while making the evidence computable from a knowledge representation perspective (i.e., semantic enrichment). Existing frameworks suggest well-promising outcomes for such integration but employ a rather limited number of sources. In particular, none have been specifically designed to support both regulatory and clinical use cases, nor have any been designed to add new resources and use cases through an open architecture. This paper discusses the architecture and functionality of a system called Large-scale Adverse Effects Related to Treatment Evidence Standardization (LAERTES) that aims to address these shortcomings.",

        "Abstract": "Two metrics, a rise in serum creatinine concentration and a decrease in urine output, are considered tantamount to the injury of the kidney tubule and the epithelial cells thereof (AKI). Yet neither criterion emphasizes the etiology or the pathogenetic heterogeneity of acute decreases in kidney excretory function. In fact, whether decreased excretory function due to contraction of the extracellular fluid volume (vAKI) or due to intrinsic kidney injury (iAKI) actually share pathogenesis and should be aggregated in the same diagnostic group remains an open question. To examine this possibility, we created mouse models of iAKI and vAKI that induced a similar increase in serum creatinine concentration. Using laser microdissection to isolate specific domains of the kidney, followed by RNA sequencing, we found that thousands of genes responded specifically to iAKI or to vAKI, but very few responded to both stimuli. In fact, the activated gene sets comprised different, functionally unrelated signal transduction pathways and were expressed in different regions of the kidney. Moreover, we identified distinctive gene expression patterns in human urine as potential biomarkers of either iAKI or vAKI, but not both. Hence, iAKI and vAKI are biologically unrelated, suggesting that molecular analysis should clarify our current definitions of acute changes in kidney excretory function.",

        "Abstract": "Reduction of preventable hospital readmissions that result from chronic or acute conditions like stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction and pneumonia remains a significant challenge for improving the outcomes and decreasing the cost of healthcare delivery in the United States. Patient readmission rates are relatively high for conditions like heart failure (HF) despite the implementation of high-quality healthcare delivery operation guidelines created by regulatory authorities. Multiple predictive models are currently available to evaluate potential 30-day readmission rates of patients. Most of these models are hypothesis driven and repetitively assess the predictive abilities of the same set of biomarkers as predictive features. In this manuscript, we discuss our attempt to develop a data-driven, electronic-medical record-wide (EMR-wide) feature selection approach and subsequent machine learning to predict readmission probabilities. We have assessed a large repertoire of variables from electronic medical records of heart failure patients in a single center. The cohort included 1,068 patients with 178 patients were readmitted within a 30-day interval (16.66% readmission rate). A total of 4,205 variables were extracted from EMR including diagnosis codes (n=1,763), medications (n=1,028), laboratory measurements (n=846), surgical procedures (n=564) and vital signs (n=4). We designed a multistep modeling strategy using the Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm. In the first step, we created individual models to classify the cases (readmitted) and controls (non-readmitted). In the second step, features contributing to predictive risk from independent models were combined into a composite model using a correlation-based feature selection (CFS) method. All models were trained and tested using a 5-fold cross-validation method, with 70% of the cohort used for training and the remaining 30% for testing. Compared to existing predictive models for HF readmission rates (AUCs in the range of 0.6-0.7), results from our EMR-wide predictive model (AUC=0.78; Accuracy=83.19%) and phenome-wide feature selection strategies are encouraging and reveal the utility of such datadriven machine learning. Fine tuning of the model, replication using multi-center cohorts and prospective clinical trial to evaluate the clinical utility would help the adoption of the model as a clinical decision system for evaluating readmission status.",

        "Abstract": "Science is not done in a vacuum - across fields of biomedicine, scientists have built on previous research and used data published in previous papers. A mainstay of scientific inquiry is the publication of one's research and recognition for this work is given in the form of citations and notoriety - ideally given in proportion to the quality of the work. Academic incentives, however, may encourage individual researchers to prioritize career ambitions over scientific truth. Recently, the New England Journal of Medicine published a commentary calling scientists who repurpose data \"research parasites\" who misuse data generated by others to demonstrate alternative hypotheses. In our opinion, the concept of data hoarding not only runs contrary to the spirit of, but also hinders scientific progress. Scientific research is meant to seek objective truth, rather than promote a personal agenda, and the only way to do so is through maximum transparency and reproducibility, no matter who is using the data\u2026.",

        "Title": "Silencing c-Myc translation as a therapeutic strategy through targeting PI3K\u03b4 and CK1\u03b5 in hematological malignancies.",
        "Abstract": "Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and the proteasome pathway are both involved in activating the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Because mTOR signaling is required for initiation of messenger RNA translation, we hypothesized that cotargeting the PI3K and proteasome pathways might synergistically inhibit translation of c-Myc. We found that a novel PI3K \u03b4 isoform inhibitor TGR-1202, but not the approved PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor idelalisib, was highly synergistic with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib in lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma cell lines and primary lymphoma and leukemia cells. TGR-1202 and carfilzomib (TC) synergistically inhibited phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), leading to suppression of c-Myc translation and silencing of c-Myc-dependent transcription. The synergistic cytotoxicity of TC was rescued by overexpression of eIF4E or c-Myc. TGR-1202, but not other PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors, inhibited casein kinase-1 \u03b5 (CK1\u03b5). Targeting CK1\u03b5 using a selective chemical inhibitor or short hairpin RNA complements the effects of idelalisib, as a single agent or in combination with carfilzomib, in repressing phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the protein level of c-Myc. These results suggest that TGR-1202 is a dual PI3K\u03b4/CK1\u03b5 inhibitor, which may in part explain the clinical activity of TGR-1202 in aggressive lymphoma not found with idelalisib. Targeting CK1\u03b5 should become an integral part of therapeutic strategies targeting translation of oncogenes such as c-Myc.",

This replication study evaluates the relationship between seasonal effects at birth and lifetime cardiovascular condition risk. We performed a Season-wide Association Study on 1,169,599 patients from Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) to compute phenome-wide associations between birth month and CVD. We then evaluated if seasonal patterns found at MSH matched those reported at Columbia University Medical Center. Coronary arteriosclerosis, essential hypertension, angina, and pre-infarction syndrome passed phenome-wide significance and their seasonal patterns matched those previously reported. Atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, and chronic myocardial ischemia had consistent patterns but were not phenome-wide significant. We confirm that CVD risk peaks for those born in the late winter/early spring among the evaluated patient populations. The replication findings bolster evidence for a seasonal birth month effect in CVD. Further study is required to identify the environmental and developmental mechanisms.",

In addition to describing the ontology and its construction, we have performed three separate case studies demonstrating its utility: (1)\u00a0An exploration of venom peptide similarity networks within specific genera; (2)\u00a0A broad overview of the distribution of available data among common taxonomic groups spanning the known tree of life; and (3)\u00a0An analysis of the distribution of venom complexity across those same taxonomic groups.

        "Abstract": "Prenatal and perinatal exposures vary seasonally (e.g., sunlight, allergens) and many diseases are linked with variance in exposure. Epidemiologists often measure these changes using birth month as a proxy for seasonal variance. Likewise, Genome-Wide Association Studies have associated or implicated these same diseases with many genes. Both disparate data types (epidemiological and genetic) can provide key insights into the underlying disease biology. We developed an algorithm that links 1)\u00a0epidemiological data from birth month studies with 2)\u00a0genetic data from published gene-disease association studies. Our framework uses existing data repositories - PubMed, DisGeNET and Gene Ontology - to produce a bipartite network that connects enriched seasonally varying biofactorss with birth month dependent diseases (BMDDs) through their overlapping developmental gene sets. As a proof-of-concept, we investigate 7 known BMDDs and highlight three important biological networks revealed by our algorithm and explore some interesting genetic mechanisms potentially responsible for the seasonal contribution to BMDDs.",

        "Abstract": "A central challenge in designing and administering effective anticoagulants is achieving the proper therapeutic window and dosage for each patient. The Hill coefficient, nH, which measures the steepness of a dose-response relationship, may be a useful gauge of this therapeutic window. We sought to measure the Hill coefficient of available anticoagulants to gain insight into their therapeutic windows. We used a simple fluorometric in vitro assay to determine clotting activity in platelet poor plasma after exposure to various concentrations of anticoagulants. The Hill coefficient for argatroban was the lowest, at 1.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2 (95% confidence interval, CI), and the Hill coefficient for fondaparinux was the highest, at 4.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3 (95% CI). Thus, doubling the dose of fondaparinux from its IC50 would decrease coagulation activity by nearly a half, whereas doubling the dose of argatroban from its IC50 would decrease coagulation activity by merely one quarter. These results show a significant variation among the Hill coefficients, suggesting a similar variation in therapeutic windows among anticoagulants in our assay.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate prognosis of outcome events, such as clinical procedures or disease diagnosis, is central in medicine. The emergence of longitudinal clinical data, like the Electronic Health Records (EHR), represents an opportunity to develop automated methods for predicting patient outcomes. However, these data are highly dimensional and very sparse, complicating the application of predictive modeling techniques. Further, their temporal nature is not fully exploited by current methods, and temporal abstraction was recently used which results in symbolic time intervals representation. We present Maitreya, a framework for the prediction of outcome events that leverages these symbolic time intervals. Using Maitreya, learn predictive models based on the temporal patterns in the clinical records that are prognostic markers and use these markers to train predictive models for eight clinical procedures. In order to decrease the number of patterns that are used as features, we propose the use of three one class feature selection methods. We evaluate the performance of Maitreya under several parameter settings, including the one-class feature selection, and compare our results to that of atemporal approaches. In general, we found that the use of temporal patterns outperformed the atemporal methods, when representing the number of pattern occurrences.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in transcription factor (TF) genes are frequently observed in tumors, often leading to aberrant transcriptional activity. Unfortunately, TFs are often considered undruggable due to the absence of targetable enzymatic activity. To address this problem, we developed CRAFTT, a computational drug-repositioning approach for targeting TF activity. CRAFTT combines ChIP-seq with drug-induced expression profiling to identify small molecules that can specifically perturb TF activity. Application to ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets revealed known drug-TF interactions, and a global drug-protein network analysis supported these predictions. Application of CRAFTT to ERG, a pro-invasive, frequently overexpressed oncogenic TF, predicted that dexamethasone would inhibit ERG activity. Dexamethasone significantly decreased cell invasion and migration in an ERG-dependent manner. Furthermore, analysis of electronic medical record data indicates a protective role for dexamethasone against prostate cancer. Altogether, our method provides a broadly applicable strategy for identifying drugs that specifically modulate TF activity.",

Spontaneous reporting systems (SRS) data, which are the mainstay of traditional drug safety surveillance, are used for hypothesis generation and to validate the newer approaches. The publicly available US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data requires substantial curation before they can be used appropriately, and applying different strategies for data cleaning and normalization can have material impact on analysis results. We provide a curated and standardized version of FAERS removing duplicate case records, applying standardized vocabularies with drug names mapped to RxNorm concepts and outcomes mapped to SNOMED-CT concepts, and pre-computed summary statistics about drug-outcome relationships for general consumption. This publicly available resource, along with the source code, will accelerate drug safety research by reducing the amount of time spent performing data management on the source FAERS reports, improving the quality of the underlying data, and enabling standardized analyses using common vocabularies.",

        "Title": "Improving condition severity classification with an efficient active learning based framework.",
        "Abstract": "Classification of condition severity can be useful for discriminating among sets of conditions or phenotypes, for example when prioritizing patient care or for other healthcare purposes. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) represent a rich source of labeled information that can be harnessed for severity classification. The labeling of EHRs is expensive and in many cases requires employing professionals with high level of expertise. In this study, we demonstrate the use of Active Learning (AL) techniques to decrease expert labeling efforts. We employ three AL methods and demonstrate their ability to reduce labeling efforts while effectively discriminating condition severity. We incorporate three AL methods into a new framework based on the original CAESAR (Classification Approach for Extracting Severity Automatically from Electronic Health Records) framework to create the Active Learning Enhancement framework (CAESAR-ALE). We applied CAESAR-ALE to a dataset containing 516 conditions of varying severity levels that were manually labeled by seven experts. Our dataset, called the \"CAESAR dataset,\" was created from the medical records of 1.9 million patients treated at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC). All three AL methods decreased labelers' efforts compared to the learning methods applied by the original CAESER framework in which the classifier was trained on the entire set of conditions; depending on the AL strategy used in the current study, the reduction ranged from 48% to 64% that can result in significant savings, both in time and money. As for the PPV (precision) measure, CAESAR-ALE achieved more than 13% absolute improvement in the predictive capabilities of the framework when classifying conditions as severe. These results demonstrate the potential of AL methods to decrease the labeling efforts of medical experts, while increasing accuracy given the same (or even a smaller) number of acquired conditions. We also demonstrated that the methods included in the CAESAR-ALE framework (Exploitation and Combination_XA) are more robust to the use of human labelers with different levels of professional expertise.",

Here we present an integrative computational approach for predicting interactions between drugs and immune cells in a system-wide manner. The approach matches gene sets between transcriptional signatures to determine their similarity. We apply the method to model the interactions between 1,309 drugs and 221 immune cell types and predict 69,995 interactions. The resulting immune-cell pharmacology map is used to predict how five drugs influence four immune cell types in humans and mice. To validate the predictions, we analyzed patient records and examined cell population changes from in vivo experiments. Our method offers a tool for screening thousands of interactions to identify relationships between drugs and the immune system.",

We present VenomKB, a new publicly accessible knowledge base and website that aims to act as a repository for emerging and putative venom therapies. Presently, it consists of three database tables: (1) Manually curated records of putative venom therapies supported by scientific literature, (2) automatically parsed MEDLINE articles describing compounds that may be venom derived, and their effects on the human body, and (3) automatically retrieved records from the new Semantic Medline resource that describe the effects of venom compounds on mammalian anatomy.

        "Abstract": "Small molecules are indispensable to modern medical therapy. However, their use may lead to unintended, negative medical outcomes commonly referred to as adverse drug reactions (ADRs). These effects vary widely in mechanism, severity, and populations affected, making ADR prediction and identification important public health concerns. Current methods rely on clinical trials and postmarket surveillance programs to find novel ADRs; however, clinical trials are limited by small sample size, whereas postmarket surveillance methods may be biased and inherently leave patients at risk until sufficient clinical evidence has been gathered. Systems pharmacology, an emerging interdisciplinary field combining network and chemical biology, provides important tools to uncover and understand ADRs and may mitigate the drawbacks of traditional methods. In particular, network analysis allows researchers to integrate heterogeneous data sources and quantify the interactions between biological and chemical entities. Recent work in this area has combined chemical, biological, and large-scale observational health data to predict ADRs in both individual patients and global populations. In this review, we explore the rapid expansion of systems pharmacology in the study of ADRs. We enumerate the existing methods and strategies and illustrate progress in the field with a model framework that incorporates crucial data elements, such as diet and comorbidities, known to modulate ADR risk. Using this framework, we highlight avenues of research that may currently be underexplored, representing opportunities for future work.",

        "Abstract": "Synthetic lethality is a genetic interaction wherein two otherwise nonessential genes cause cellular inviability when knocked out simultaneously. Drugs can mimic genetic knock-out effects; therefore, our understanding of promiscuous drugs, polypharmacology-related adverse drug reactions, and multi-drug therapies, especially cancer combination therapy, may be informed by a deeper understanding of synthetic lethality. However, the colossal experimental burden in humans necessitates in silico methods to guide the identification of synthetic lethal pairs. Here, we present SINaTRA (Species-INdependent TRAnslation), a network-based methodology that discovers genome-wide synthetic lethality in translation between species. SINaTRA uses connectivity homology, defined as biological connectivity patterns that persist across species, to identify synthetic lethal pairs. Importantly, our approach does not rely on genetic homology or structural and functional similarity, and it significantly outperforms models utilizing these data. We validate SINaTRA by predicting synthetic lethality in S. pombe using S. cerevisiae data, then identify over one million putative human synthetic lethal pairs to guide experimental approaches. We highlight the translational applications of our algorithm for drug discovery by identifying clusters of genes significantly enriched for single- and multi-drug cancer therapies.",

Literature estimates 1% of ADEs recorded in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are reported to federal databases making EHRs a vital source of ADE-related information. Using Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC)'s EHRs, we developed an algorithm to mine for vaccine-related ADEs occurring within 3 months of vaccination. In phase one, we measured the association between vaccinated patients with an ADE (cases) against those vaccinated without an ADE. To adjust for healthcare-process effects, phase two compared cases against those who returned to CUMC within 3 months without an ADE. We report 7 results passing multiplicity correction after demographic confounder adjustment. We observed an association, having some literature support, between swine flu vaccination and ADEs (H1N1v-like, OR=9.469, p<0.001; H1N1/H3N2, OR=3.207, p<0.001).

Central to this goal is, EHR-phenotyping, also known as cohort identification, which remains a significant challenge. Complex phenotypes often require multivariate and multi-scale analyses, ultimately leading to manually created phenotype definitions. We present Ontology-driven Reports-based Phenotyping from Unique Signatures (ORPheUS), an automated approach to EHR-phenotyping. To do this we identify unique signatures of abnormal clinical pathology reports that correspond to pre-defined medical terms from biomedical ontologies. By using only the clinical pathology, or \"lab\", reports we are able to mitigate clinical biases enabling researchers to explore other dimensions of the EHR. We used ORPheUS to generate signatures for 858 diseases and validated against reference cohorts for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Atrial Fibrillation (AF). Our results suggest that our approach, using solely clinical pathology reports, is an effective as a primary screening tool for automated clinical phenotyping.",

        "Abstract": "Identification of Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) is a significant challenge during drug development and clinical practice. DDIs are responsible for many adverse drug effects (ADEs), decreasing patient quality of life and causing higher care expenses. DDIs are not systematically evaluated in pre-clinical or clinical trials and so the FDA U. S. Food and Drug Administration relies on post-marketing surveillance to monitor patient safety. However, existing pharmacovigilance algorithms show poor performance for detecting DDIs exhibiting prohibitively high false positive rates. Alternatively, methods based on chemical structure and pharmacological similarity have shown promise in adverse drug event detection. We hypothesize that the use of chemical biology data in a post hoc analysis of pharmacovigilance results will significantly improve the detection of dangerous interactions. Our model integrates a reference standard of DDIs known to cause arrhythmias with drug similarity data. To compare similarity between drugs we used chemical structure (both 2D and 3D molecular structure), adverse drug side effects, chemogenomic targets, drug indication classes, and known drug-drug interactions. We evaluated the method on external reference standards. Our results showed an enhancement of sensitivity, specificity and precision in different top positions with the use of similarity measures to rank the candidates extracted from pharmacovigilance data. For the top 100 DDI candidates, similarity-based modeling yielded close to twofold precision enhancement compared to the proportional reporting ratio (PRR). Moreover, the method helps in the DDI decision making through the identification of the DDI in the reference standard that generated the candidate.",

        "Abstract": "Although potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs) are a significant source of preventable drug-related harm, there is currently no single complete source of PDDI information. In the current study, all publically available sources of PDDI information that could be identified using a comprehensive and broad search were combined into a single dataset. The combined dataset merged fourteen different sources including 5 clinically-oriented information sources, 4 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Corpora, and 5 Bioinformatics/Pharmacovigilance information sources. As a comprehensive PDDI source, the merged dataset might benefit the pharmacovigilance text mining community by making it possible to compare the representativeness of NLP corpora for PDDI text extraction tasks, and specifying elements that can be useful for future PDDI extraction purposes. An analysis of the overlap between and across the data sources showed that there was little overlap. Even comprehensive PDDI lists such as DrugBank, KEGG, and the NDF-RT had less than 50% overlap with each other. Moreover, all of the comprehensive lists had incomplete coverage of two data sources that focus on PDDIs of interest in most clinical settings. Based on this information, we think that systems that provide access to the comprehensive lists, such as APIs into RxNorm, should be careful to inform users that the lists may be incomplete with respect to PDDIs that drug experts suggest clinicians be aware of. In spite of the low degree of overlap, several dozen cases were identified where PDDI information provided in drug product labeling might be augmented by the merged dataset. Moreover, the combined dataset was also shown to improve the performance of an existing PDDI NLP pipeline and a recently published PDDI pharmacovigilance protocol. Future work will focus on improvement of the methods for mapping between PDDI information sources, identifying methods to improve the use of the merged dataset in PDDI NLP algorithms, integrating high-quality PDDI information from the merged dataset into Wikidata, and making the combined dataset accessible as Semantic Web Linked Data.",

Severity is important for distinguishing among phenotypes; however other severity indices classify patient-level severity (e.g., mild vs. acute dermatitis) rather than phenotype-level severity (e.g., acne vs. myocardial infarction). Phenotype-level severity is independent of the individual patient's state and is relative to other phenotypes. Further, phenotype-level severity does not change based on the individual patient. For example, acne is mild at the phenotype-level and relative to other phenotypes. Therefore, a given patient may have a severe form of acne (this is the patient-level severity), but this does not effect its overall designation as a mild phenotype at the phenotype-level.",

        "Abstract": "Adverse drugs events (ADEs) detection constitutes a considerable concern in patient safety and public health care. For this reason, it is important to develop methods that improve ADE signal detection in pharmacovigilance databases. Our objective is to apply 3D pharmacophoric similarity models to enhance ADE recognition in Offsides, a pharmacovigilance resource with drug-ADE associations extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). We developed a multi-ADE predictor implementing 3D drug similarity based on a pharmacophoric approach, with an ADE reference standard extracted from the SIDER database. The results showed that the application of our 3D multi-type ADE predictor to the pharmacovigilance data in Offsides improved ADE identification and generated enriched sets of drug-ADE signals. The global ROC curve for the Offsides ADE candidates ranked with the 3D similarity score showed an area of 0.7. The 3D predictor also allows the identification of the most similar drug that causes the ADE under study, which could provide hypotheses about mechanisms of action and ADE etiology. Our method is useful in drug development, screening potential adverse effects in experimental drugs, and in drug safety, applicable to the evaluation of ADE signals selected through pharmacovigilance data mining.",

In this study we assessed the quality of family history data captured in an established commercial electronic health record (EHR) at a large academic medical center. Because the EHR had no centralized location to store family history information, it was collected as part of clinical notes in structured or free-text format. We analyzed differences between 10,000 free-text and 9,121 structured family history observations. Each observation was classified according to disease presence/absence and family member affected (e.g., father, mother, etc.). The structured notes did not collect a complete family history as defined by standards endorsed by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; the free-text notes contained more information than the structured notes, but still not enough to be considered \"complete.\" Several barriers remain for collecting complete, useful family history data in electronic health records.",

        "Abstract": "Co-administration of drugs is a primary cause of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) and a drain on the health care industry costing billions of dollars and reducing quality of life. Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) account for as much as 30% of all ADRs. Unfortunately, DDIs are not systematically explored pre-clinically and are difficult to detect in post-marketing drug surveillance. For this reason, the detection and prediction of DDIs is an important problem in both drug development and pharmacovigilance. The comparison of the 3D drug structures provides a powerful tool for DDI prediction. In this article, we present the first large scale model for predicting DDIs using the drug's 3D molecular structure. In addition to identifying putative drug interactions we can also isolate the pharmacological or clinical effect associated with the predicted interactions. The model has good performance in two different hold-out validations and in external test sets. We found that the top scored drug pairs were significantly enriched for known clinically relevant interactions and that 3D structure data is providing significantly independent information from other approaches, including 2D structure (p=0.003). We demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed methodology to systematically identify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions, provided an exploratory tool that can be used for patient safety and pre-clinical toxicity screening, and reviewed the state of the art methods used to detect DDIs.",

        "Abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a major cause of adverse drug effects and a public health concern, as they increase hospital care expenses and reduce patients' quality of life. DDI detection is, therefore, an important objective in patient safety, one whose pursuit affects drug development and pharmacovigilance. In this article, we describe a protocol applicable on a large scale to predict novel DDIs based on similarity of drug interaction candidates to drugs involved in established DDIs. The method integrates a reference standard database of known DDIs with drug similarity information extracted from different sources, such as 2D and 3D molecular structure, interaction profile, target and side-effect similarities. The method is interpretable in that it generates drug interaction candidates that are traceable to pharmacological or clinical effects. We describe a protocol with applications in patient safety and preclinical toxicity screening. The time frame to implement this protocol is 5-7 h, with additional time potentially necessary, depending on the complexity of the reference standard DDI database and the similarity measures implemented.",

        "Abstract": "A study focused on the discovery of new chemical entities based on the 3-arylcoumarin scaffold was performed with the aim of finding new adenosine receptor (AR) ligands. Thirteen synthesized compounds were evaluated by radioligand binding (A1, A2A, and A3) and adenylyl cyclase activity (A2B) assays in order to study their affinity for the four human AR (hAR) subtypes. Seven of the studied compounds proved to be selective A3 AR ligands, with 3-(4'-methylphenyl)-8-(2-oxopropoxy)coumarin (12) being the most potent (Ki =634\u2005nM). None of the compounds showed affinity for the A2B receptor, while four compounds were found to be nonselective AR ligands for the other three subtypes. Docking simulations were carried out to identify the hypothetical binding mode and to rationalize the interaction of these types of coumarin derivatives with the binding site of the three ARs to which binding was observed. The results allowed us to conclude that the 3-arylcoumarin scaffold composes a novel and promising class of A3 AR ligands. ADME properties were also calculated, with the results suggesting that these compounds are promising leads for the identification of new drug candidates.",

        "Abstract": "The entire drug safety enterprise has a need to search, retrieve, evaluate, and synthesize scientific evidence more efficiently. This discovery and synthesis process would be greatly accelerated through access to a common framework that brings all relevant information sources together within a standardized structure. This presents an opportunity to establish an open-source community effort to develop a global knowledge base, one that brings together and standardizes all available information for all drugs and all health outcomes of interest (HOIs) from all electronic sources pertinent to drug safety. To make this vision a reality, we have established a workgroup within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI, http://ohdsi.org) collaborative. The workgroup's mission is to develop an open-source standardized knowledge base for the effects of medical products and an efficient procedure for maintaining and expanding it. The knowledge base will make it simpler for practitioners to access, retrieve, and synthesize evidence so that they can reach a rigorous and accurate assessment of causal relationships between a given drug and HOI. Development of the knowledge base will proceed with the measureable goal of supporting an efficient and thorough evidence-based assessment of the effects of 1,000 active ingredients across 100 HOIs. This non-trivial task will result in a high-quality and generally applicable drug safety knowledge base. It will also yield a reference standard of drug-HOI pairs that will enable more advanced methodological research that empirically evaluates the performance of drug safety analysis methods.",

        "Abstract": "Exchange of extracellular cystine for intracellular glutamate by the antiporter system xc (-) is implicated in numerous pathologies. Pharmacological agents that inhibit system xc (-) activity with high potency have long been sought, but have remained elusive. In this study, we report that the small molecule erastin is a potent, selective inhibitor of system xc (-). RNA sequencing revealed that inhibition of cystine-glutamate exchange leads to activation of an ER stress response and upregulation of CHAC1, providing a pharmacodynamic marker for system xc (-) inhibition. We also found that the clinically approved anti-cancer drug sorafenib, but not other kinase inhibitors, inhibits system xc (-) function and can trigger ER stress and ferroptosis. In an analysis of hospital records and adverse event reports, we found that patients treated with sorafenib exhibited unique metabolic and phenotypic alterations compared to patients treated with other kinase-inhibiting drugs. Finally, using a genetic approach, we identified new genes dramatically upregulated in cells resistant to ferroptosis.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02523.001.",

        "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants for thousands of diseases and traits. We evaluated the relationships between specific risk factors (for example, blood cholesterol level) and diseases on the basis of their shared genetic architecture in a comprehensive human disease-single-nucleotide polymorphism association database (VARIMED), analyzing the findings from 8962 published association studies. Similarity between traits and diseases was statistically evaluated on the basis of their association with shared gene variants. We identified 120 disease-trait pairs that were statistically similar, and of these, we tested and validated five previously unknown disease-trait associations by searching electronic medical records (EMRs) from three independent medical centers for evidence of the trait appearing in patients within 1 year of first diagnosis of the disease. We validated that the mean corpuscular volume is elevated before diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia; both have associated variants in the gene IKZF1. Platelet count is decreased before diagnosis of alcohol dependence; both are associated with variants in the gene C12orf51. Alkaline phosphatase level is elevated in patients with venous thromboembolism; both share variants in ABO. Similarly, we found that prostate-specific antigen and serum magnesium levels were altered before the diagnosis of lung cancer and gastric cancer, respectively. Disease-trait associations identify traits that could serve as future prognostics, if validated through EMR and subsequent prospective trials.",

        "Abstract": "Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is a useful target in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and depressive disorders. Both isoforms, MAO-A and MAO-B, are known to play critical roles in disease progression, and as such, the identification of novel, potent and selective inhibitors is an important research goal. Here, two series of 3-phenylcoumarin derivatives were synthesized and evaluated against MAO-A and MAO-B. Most of the compounds tested acted preferentially on MAO-B, with IC50 values in the micromolar to nanomolar range. Only 6-chloro-4-hydroxy-3-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)coumarin exhibited activity against the MAO-A isoform, while still retaining good selectivity for MAO-B. 6-Chloro-3-phenylcoumarins unsubstituted at the 4\u2005position were found to be more active as MAO-B inhibitors than the corresponding 4-hydroxylated coumarins. For 4-unsubstituted coumarins, meta and para positions on the 3-phenyl ring seem to be the most favorable for substitution. Molecular docking simulations were used to explain the observed hMAO-B structure-activity relationships for this type of compound. 6-Chloro-3-(3'-methoxyphenyl)coumarin was the most active compound identified (IC50=0.001\u2005\u03bcM) and is several times more potent and selective than the reference compound, R-(-)-deprenyl hydrochloride. This compound represents a novel tool for the further investigation of the therapeutic potential of MAO-B inhibitors.",

        "Abstract": "The design, synthesis, pharmacological evaluation, and theoretical studies of a new series of halogenated 3-arylcoumarins were carried out with the aim of finding new structural and biological features. This series displays several alkyl, hydroxy, halogen, and/or alkoxy groups in both benzene rings of the 3-arylcoumarin scaffold. Most of the compounds studied show high affinity and selectivity for the human monoamine oxidase\u2005B (hMAO-B) isoenzyme, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar and picomolar range. Most of the evaluated compounds display higher MAO-B inhibitory activity and selectivity than selegiline (the reference compound). Coumarin 12 (3-(3-bromophenyl)-6-methylcoumarin) is the most active compound (IC50 =134\u2005pM), being 140-fold more active than selegiline and showing the highest specificity for hMAO-B. To better understand the structure-activity relationships, docking experiments were carried out on human monoamine oxidase (A and B) structures. Finally, the prediction of passive blood-brain partitioning, based on in silico derived physicochemical descriptors, was performed.",

        "Abstract": "The United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) consists of adverse event (AE) reports linked to approved drugs. The database is widely used to support post-marketing safety surveillance programs. Sometimes cited as a limitation to the usefulness of FAERS, however, is the 'Weber effect,' which is often summarized by stating that AE reporting peaks at the end of the second year after a regulatory authority approves a drug. Weber described this effect in 1984 based upon a single class of medications prescribed in the United Kingdom. Since that time, the FDA has made a concerted effort to improve both reporting and the database itself. Both volume and quality of AE reporting has dramatically improved since Weber's report, with an estimated 800,000 yearly reports now being logged into FAERS.",

        "Abstract": "Bleeding complications after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have been associated with higher short and long-term mortality. Bivalirudin has been shown to reduce bleeding complications in patients who underwent PCI; however, the impact of anemia on bleeding complications and long-term mortality has not been studied. A total of 11,991 patients who underwent PCI over a period of 8\u00a0years with bivalirudin as the primary antithrombotic agent were included. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization definition. Bleeding complications were prospectively collected. Survival analysis was performed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Of the 11,991 patients, 4,815 patients (40%) had baseline anemia. Major bleeding occurred in 3.3% of patients with anemia compared with 0.7% of patients without anemia (p <0.001) driven largely by transfusion events. In the overall study population, major bleeding was a significant predictor of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.8, p\u00a0= 0.027) at a mean follow-up of 2.6\u00a0years (interquartile range 1.4 to 3.5). In patients with anemia, major bleeding remained an independent predictor of mortality (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0, p\u00a0= 0.008); however, in patients without anemia, it did not (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.03, p\u00a0= 0.62). In patients who underwent PCI with bivalirudin therapy, major bleeding is associated with early and long-term mortality, which is more pronounced in patients with baseline anemia.",

        "Abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) are fundamental controllers of cellular regulation that function in a complex and combinatorial manner. Accurate identification of a transcription factor's targets is essential to understanding the role that factors play in disease biology. However, due to a high false positive rate, identifying coherent functional target sets is difficult. We have created an improved mapping of targets by integrating ChIP-Seq data with 423 functional modules derived from 9,395 human expression experiments. We identified 5,002 TF-module relationships, significantly improved TF target prediction, and found 30 high-confidence TF-TF associations, of which 14 are known. Importantly, we also connected TFs to diseases through these functional modules and identified 3,859 significant TF-disease relationships. As an example, we found a link between MEF2A and Crohn's disease, which we validated in an independent expression dataset. These results show the power of combining expression data and ChIP-Seq data to remove noise and better extract the associations between TFs, functional modules, and disease.",

        "Abstract": "The increasing public availability of personal complete genome sequencing data has ushered in an era of democratized genomics. However, read mapping and variant calling software is constantly improving and individuals with personal genomic data may prefer to customize and update their variant calls. Here, we describe STORMSeq (Scalable Tools for Open-Source Read Mapping), a graphical interface cloud computing solution that does not require a parallel computing environment or extensive technical experience. This customizable and modular system performs read mapping, read cleaning, and variant calling and annotation. At present, STORMSeq costs approximately $2 and 5-10 hours to process a full exome sequence and $30 and 3-8 days to process a whole genome sequence. We provide this open-access and open-source resource as a user-friendly interface in Amazon EC2.",

        "Title": "Genome wide analysis of drug-induced torsades de pointes: lack of common variants with large effect sizes.",
        "Abstract": "Marked prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram associated with the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia Torsades de Pointes is a serious adverse event during treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs and other culprit medications, and is a common cause for drug relabeling and withdrawal. Although clinical risk factors have been identified, the syndrome remains unpredictable in an individual patient. Here we used genome-wide association analysis to search for common predisposing genetic variants. Cases of drug-induced Torsades de Pointes (diTdP), treatment tolerant controls, and general population controls were ascertained across multiple sites using common definitions, and genotyped on the Illumina 610k or 1M-Duo BeadChips. Principal Components Analysis was used to select 216 Northwestern European diTdP cases and 771 ancestry-matched controls, including treatment-tolerant and general population subjects. With these sample sizes, there is 80% power to detect a variant at genome-wide significance with minor allele frequency of 10% and conferring an odds ratio of \u22652.7. Tests of association were carried out for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) by logistic regression adjusting for gender and population structure. No SNP reached genome wide-significance; the variant with the lowest P value was rs2276314, a non-synonymous coding variant in C18orf21 (p \u200a=\u200a 3\u00d710(-7), odds ratio\u200a=\u200a2, 95% confidence intervals: 1.5-2.6). The haplotype formed by rs2276314 and a second SNP, rs767531, was significantly more frequent in controls than cases (p \u200a=\u200a 3\u00d710(-9)). Expanding the number of controls and a gene-based analysis did not yield significant associations. This study argues that common genomic variants do not contribute importantly to risk for drug-induced Torsades de Pointes across multiple drugs.",

        "Abstract": "A more nuanced approach to drug design is to use multiple drugs in combination to target interacting or complementary pathways. Drug combination treatments have shown higher efficacy, fewer side effects, and less toxicity compared to single-drug treatment. In this Review, we focus on the use of high-throughput biological measurements (genetics, transcripts, and chemogenetic interactions) and the computational methods they necessitate to further combinatorial drug design (CDD). We highlight the state-of-the-art analytical methods, including network analysis, integrative informatics, and dynamic molecular modeling, that have been used successfully in CDD. Finally, we present an exhaustive list of the publicly available data and methodological resources available to the community. Such next-generation technologies that enable the measurement of millions of cellular data points simultaneously may usher in a new paradigm in drug discovery, where medicine is viewed as a system of interacting genes and pathways rather than the result of an individual protein or gene.",

        "Abstract": "Many genome-wide association studies focus on associating single loci with target phenotypes. However, in the setting of rare variation, accumulating sufficient samples to assess these associations can be difficult. Moreover, multiple variations in a gene or a set of genes within a pathway may all contribute to the phenotype, suggesting that the aggregation of variations found over the gene or pathway may be useful for improving the power to detect associations.",

        "Abstract": "Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an important drug target for the treatment of neurological disorders. Several 3-arylcoumarin derivatives were previously described as interesting selective MAO-B inhibitors. Preserving the trans-stilbene structure, a series of 2-arylbenzofuran and corresponding 3-arylcoumarin derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of both MAO isoforms, MAO-A and MAO-B. In general, both types of derivatives were found to be selective MAO-B inhibitors, with IC50 values in the nano- to micromolar range. 5-Nitro-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)benzofuran (8) is the most active compound of the benzofuran series, presenting MAO-B selectivity and reversible inhibition (IC50 =140 nM). 3-(4'-Methoxyphenyl)-6-nitrocoumarin (15), with the same substitution pattern as that of compound 8, was found to be the most active MAO-B inhibitor of the coumarin series (IC50 =3 nM). However, 3-phenylcoumarin 14 showed activity in the same range (IC50 =6 nM), is reversible, and also severalfold more selective than compound 15. Docking experiments for the most active compounds into the MAO-B and MAO-A binding pockets highlighted different interactions between the derivative classes (2-arylbenzofurans and 3-arylcoumarins), and provided new information about the enzyme-inhibitor interaction and the potential therapeutic application of these scaffolds.",

        "Abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) constitute an important problem in postmarketing pharmacovigilance and in the development of new drugs. The effectiveness or toxicity of a medication could be affected by the co-administration of other drugs that share pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic pathways. For this reason, a great effort is being made to develop new methodologies to detect and assess DDIs. In this article, we present a novel method based on drug interaction profile fingerprints (IPFs) with successful application to DDI detection. IPFs were generated based on the DrugBank database, which provided 9,454 well-established DDIs as a primary source of interaction data. The model uses IPFs to measure the similarity of pairs of drugs and generates new putative DDIs from the non-intersecting interactions of a pair. We described as part of our analysis the pharmacological and biological effects associated with the putative interactions; for example, the interaction between haloperidol and dicyclomine can cause increased risk of psychosis and tardive dyskinesia. First, we evaluated the method through hold-out validation and then by using four independent test sets that did not overlap with DrugBank. Precision for the test sets ranged from 0.4-0.5 with more than two fold enrichment factor enhancement. In conclusion, we demonstrated the usefulness of the method in pharmacovigilance as a DDI predictor, and created a dataset of potential DDIs, highlighting the etiology or pharmacological effect of the DDI, and providing an exploratory tool to facilitate decision support in DDI detection and patient safety.",

Most of the new compounds selectively inhibited MAO-B isoenzyme with IC50 values in the micro or nanoMolar ranges. Since these compounds must achieve the brain cells, theoretical evaluation of ADME properties were also carried out. Compound 8 (benzyl(coumarin-3-yl)carbamate), which presented the most interesting in\u00a0vitro MAO-B inhibitory profile (IC50 against MAO-B\u00a0=\u00a045\u00a0nM), was subjected to further studies. This in\u00a0vitro MAO-B inhibitory activity is comparable with that of the selegiline, the reference compound (IC50 against MAO-B\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0nM).

We hypothesized that Internet users may provide early clues about adverse drug events via their online information-seeking. We conducted a large-scale study of Web search log data gathered during 2010. We pay particular attention to the specific drug pairing of paroxetine and pravastatin, whose interaction was reported to cause hyperglycemia after the time period of the online logs used in the analysis. We also examine sets of drug pairs known to be associated with hyperglycemia and those not associated with hyperglycemia. We find that anonymized signals on drug interactions can be mined from search logs. Compared to analyses of other sources such as electronic health records (EHR), logs are inexpensive to collect and mine. The results demonstrate that logs of the search activities of populations of computer users can contribute to drug safety surveillance.",

        "Abstract": "Adverse drug events remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. Many adverse events are not detected during clinical trials before a drug receives approval for use in the clinic. Fortunately, as part of postmarketing surveillance, regulatory agencies and other institutions maintain large collections of adverse event reports, and these databases present an opportunity to study drug effects from patient population data. However, confounding factors such as concomitant medications, patient demographics, patient medical histories, and reasons for prescribing a drug often are uncharacterized in spontaneous reporting systems, and these omissions can limit the use of quantitative signal detection methods used in the analysis of such data. Here, we present an adaptive data-driven approach for correcting these factors in cases for which the covariates are unknown or unmeasured and combine this approach with existing methods to improve analyses of drug effects using three test data sets. We also present a comprehensive database of drug effects (Offsides) and a database of drug-drug interaction side effects (Twosides). To demonstrate the biological use of these new resources, we used them to identify drug targets, predict drug indications, and discover drug class interactions. We then corroborated 47 (P < 0.0001) of the drug class interactions using an independent analysis of electronic medical records. Our analysis suggests that combined treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and thiazides is associated with significantly increased incidence of prolonged QT intervals. We conclude that confounding effects from covariates in observational clinical data can be controlled in data analyses and thus improve the detection and prediction of adverse drug effects and interactions.",

More than 100,000 individuals have been genotyped by direct-to-consumer genetic testing services, which offer a glimpse into the interpretation and exploration of a personal genome. However, these interpretations, which require extensive manual curation, are subject to the preferences of the company and are not customizable by the individual. Academic institutions teaching personalized medicine, as well as genetic hobbyists, may prefer to customize their analysis and have full control over the content and method of interpretation. We present the Interpretome, a system for private genome interpretation, which contains all genotype information in client-side interpretation scripts, supported by server-side databases. We provide state-of-the-art analyses for teaching clinical implications of personal genomics, including disease risk assessment and pharmacogenomics. Additionally, we have implemented client-side algorithms for ancestry inference, demonstrating the power of these methods without excessive computation. Finally, the modular nature of the system allows for plugin capabilities for custom analyses. This system will allow for personal genome exploration without compromising privacy, facilitating hands-on courses in genomics and personalized medicine.",

        "Abstract": "Regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level is achieved by complex interactions of transcription factors operating at their target genes. Dissecting the specific combination of factors that bind each target is a significant challenge. Here, we describe in detail the Allele Binding Cooperativity test, which uses variation in transcription factor binding among individuals to discover combinations of factors and their targets. We developed the ALPHABIT (a large-scale process to hunt for allele binding interacting transcription factors) pipeline, which includes statistical analysis of binding sites followed by experimental validation, and demonstrate that this method predicts transcription factors that associate with NF\u03baB. Our method successfully identifies factors that have been known to work with NF\u03baB (E2A, STAT1, IRF2), but whose global coassociation and sites of cooperative action were not known. In addition, we identify a unique coassociation (EBF1) that had not been reported previously. We present a general approach for discovering combinatorial models of regulation and advance our understanding of the genetic basis of variation in transcription factor binding.",

Spontaneous reporting systems routinely collect ADEs from patients on complex combinations of medications and provide an opportunity to discover unexpected drug interactions. Unfortunately, current algorithms for such \"signal detection\" are limited by underreporting of interactions that are not expected. We present a novel method to identify latent drug interaction signals in the case of underreporting.",

        "Abstract": "A key challenge in pharmacogenomics is the identification of genes whose variants contribute to drug response phenotypes, which can include severe adverse effects. Pharmacogenomics GWAS attempt to elucidate genotypes predictive of drug response. However, the size of these studies has severely limited their power and potential application. We propose a novel knowledge integration and SNP aggregation approach for identifying genes impacting drug response. Our SNP aggregation method characterizes the degree to which uncommon alleles of a gene are associated with drug response. We first use pre-existing knowledge sources to rank pharmacogenes by their likelihood to affect drug response. We then define a summary score for each gene based on allele frequencies and train linear and logistic regression classifiers to predict drug response phenotypes.",

        "Title": "Improving the prediction of pharmacogenes using text-derived drug-gene relationships.",
        "Abstract": "A critical goal of pharmacogenomics research is to identify genes that can explain variation in drug response. We have previously reported a method that creates a genome-scale ranking of genes likely to interact with a drug. The algorithm uses information about drug structure and indications of use to rank the genes. Although the algorithm has good performance, its performance depends on a curated set of drug-gene relationships that is expensive to create and difficult to maintain. In this work, we assess the utility of text mining in extracting a network of drug-gene relationships automatically. This provides a valuable aggregate source of knowledge, subsequently used as input into the algorithm that ranks potential pharmacogenes. Using a drug-gene network created from sentence-level co-occurrence in the full text of scientific articles, we compared the performance to that of a network created by manual curation of those articles. Under a wide range of conditions, we show that a knowledge base derived from text-mining the literature performs as well as, and sometimes better than, a high-quality, manually curated knowledge base. We conclude that we can use relationships mined automatically from the literature as a knowledgebase for pharmacogenomics relationships. Additionally, when relationships are missed by text mining, our system can accurately extrapolate new relationships with 77.4% precision.",
