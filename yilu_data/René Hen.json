        "Title": "Adult Neurogenesis, Context Encoding, and Pattern Separation: A Pathway for Treating Overgeneralization.",
        "Abstract": "In mammals, the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus is one of two brain regions (with the subventricular zone of the olfactory bulb) that continues to generate new neurons throughout adulthood, a phenomenon known as adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) (Eriksson et al., Nat Med 4:1313-1317, 1998; Garc\u00eda-Verdugo et al., J Neurobiol 36:234-248, 1998). The integration of these new neurons into the dentate gyrus (DG) has implications for memory encoding, with unique firing and wiring properties of immature neurons that affect how the hippocampal network encodes and stores attributes of memory. In this chapter, we will describe the process of AHN and properties of adult-born cells as they integrate into the hippocampal circuit and mature. Then, we will discuss some methodological considerations before we review evidence for the role of AHN in two major processes supporting memory that are performed by the DG. First, we will discuss encoding of contextual information for episodic memories and how this is facilitated by AHN. Second, will discuss pattern separation, a major role of the DG that reduces interference for the formation of new memories. Finally, we will review clinical and translational considerations, suggesting that stimulation of AHN may help decrease overgeneralization-a common endophenotype of mood, anxiety, trauma-related, and age-related disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Therapeutic use of electroconvulsive shock (ECS) is 75% effective for the remission of treatment-resistant depression. Like other more common forms of antidepressant treatment such as fluoxetine, ECS has been shown to increase neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of rodent models. Yet the question of how ECS-induced neurogenesis supports improvement of depressive symptoms remains unknown. Here, we show that ECS-induced neurogenesis is necessary to improve depressive-like behavior of mice exposed to chronic corticosterone (Cort). We then use slice electrophysiology to show that optogenetic stimulation of adult-born neurons produces a greater hyperpolarization in mature granule neurons after ECS vs Sham treatment. We identify that this hyperpolarization requires the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2). Consistent with this finding, we observe reduced expression of the immediate early gene cFos in the granule cell layer of ECS vs Sham subjects. We then show that mGluR2 knockdown specifically in ventral granule neurons blunts the antidepressant-like behavioral effects of ECS. Using single nucleus RNA sequencing, we reveal major transcriptomic shifts in granule neurons after treatment with ECS+Cort or fluoxetine+Cort vs Cort alone. We identify a population of immature cells which has greater representation in both ECS+Cort and fluoxetine+Cort treated samples vs Cort alone. We also find global differences in ECS-vs fluoxetine-induced transcriptomic shifts. Together, these findings highlight a critical role for immature granule cells and mGluR2 signaling in the antidepressant action of ECS.",

        "Abstract": "The ventral hippocampus is a critical node in the distributed brain network that controls anxiety. Using miniature microscopy and calcium imaging, we recorded ventral CA1 (vCA1) neurons in freely moving mice as they explored variants of classic behavioral assays for anxiety. Unsupervised behavioral segmentation revealed clusters of behavioral motifs that corresponded to exploratory and vigilance-like states. We discovered multiple vCA1 population codes that represented the anxiogenic features of the environment, such as bright light and openness, as well as the moment-to-moment anxiety state of the animals. These population codes possessed distinct generalization properties: neural representations of anxiogenic features were different for open field and elevated plus/zero maze tasks, while neural representations of moment-to-moment anxiety state were similar across both experimental contexts. Our results suggest that anxiety is not tied to the aversive compartments of these mazes but is rather defined by a behavioral state and its corresponding population code that generalizes across environments.",

        "Title": "Heterozygous and homozygous gene knockout of the 5-HT1B receptor have different effects on methamphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization.",
        "Abstract": "The psychostimulant drug methamphetamine (METH) causes euphoria in humans and locomotor hyperactivity in rodents by acting on the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway and has severe abuse and addiction liability. Behavioral sensitization, an increased behavioral response to a drug with repeated administration, can persist for many months after the last administration. Research has shown that the serotonin 1B (5-HT1B) receptor plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of drug addiction, as well as other addictive behaviors. This study examined the role of 5-HT1B receptors in METH-induced locomotor sensitization using 5-HT1B knockout (KO) mice. To clarify the action of METH in 5-HT1B KO mice the effects of METH on extracellular levels of DA (DAec) and 5-HT (5-HTec) in the caudate putamen (CPu) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) were examined. Locomotor sensitization and extracellular monoamine levels were determined in wild-type mice (5-HT1B +/+), heterozygous 5-HT1B receptor KO (5-HT1B +/-) mice and homozygous 5-HT1B receptor KO mice (5-HT1B -/-). Behavioral sensitization to METH was enhanced in 5-HT1B -/- mice compared to 5-HT1B +/+ mice but was attenuated in 5-HT1B +/- mice compared to 5-HT1B +/+ and 5-HT1B -/- mice. In vivo, microdialysis demonstrated that acute administration of METH increases DAec levels in the CPu and NAc of 5-HT1B KO mice compared to saline groups. In 5-HT1B +/- mice, METH increased 5-HTec levels in the CPu, and DAec levels in the NAc were higher than in others.5-HT1B receptors play an important role in regulating METH-induced behavioral sensitization.",

        "Abstract": "We investigated the mechanisms underlying the effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine on behavior and adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). After confirming our earlier report that the signaling molecule \u03b2-arrestin-2 (\u03b2-Arr2) is required for the antidepressant-like effects of fluoxetine, we found that the effects of fluoxetine on proliferation of neural progenitors and survival of adult-born granule cells are absent in the \u03b2-Arr2 knockout (KO) mice. To our surprise, fluoxetine induced a dramatic upregulation of the number of doublecortin (DCX)-expressing cells in the \u03b2-Arr2 KO mice, indicating that this marker can be increased even though AHN is not. We discovered two other conditions where a complex relationship occurs between the number of DCX-expressing cells compared to levels of AHN: a chronic antidepressant model where DCX is upregulated and an inflammation model where DCX is downregulated. We concluded that assessing the number of DCX-expressing cells alone to quantify levels of AHN can be complex and that caution should be applied when label retention techniques are unavailable.",

        "Abstract": "Head-restrained behavioral experiments in mice allow neuroscientists to observe neural circuit activity with high-resolution electrophysiological and optical imaging tools while delivering precise sensory stimuli to a behaving animal. Recently, human and rodent studies using virtual reality (VR) environments have shown VR to be an important tool for uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying spatial learning in the hippocampus and cortex, due to the extremely precise control over parameters such as spatial and contextual cues. Setting up virtual environments for rodent spatial behaviors can, however, be costly and require an extensive background in engineering and computer programming. Here, we present a simple yet powerful system based upon inexpensive, modular, open-source hardware and software that enables researchers to study spatial learning in head-restrained mice using a VR environment. This system uses coupled microcontrollers to measure locomotion and deliver behavioral stimuli while head-restrained mice run on a wheel in concert with a virtual linear track environment rendered by a graphical software package running on a single-board computer. The emphasis on distributed processing allows researchers to design flexible, modular systems to elicit and measure complex spatial behaviors in mice in order to determine the connection between neural circuit activity and spatial learning in the mammalian brain.",

        "Abstract": "Two-thirds of individuals experience adversity during childhood such as neglect, abuse or highly-stressful events. Early-life adversity (ELA) increases the life-long risk of developing mood and substance use disorders. Reward-related deficits has emerged as a key endophenotype of such psychiatric disorders. Animal models are invaluable for studying how ELA leads to reward deficits. However, the existing literature is heterogenous with difficult to reconcile findings. To create an overview, we conducted a systematic review containing multiple meta-analyses regarding the effects of ELA on reward processes overall and on specific aspects of reward processing in animal models. A comprehensive search identified 120 studies. Most studies omitted key details resulting in unclear risk of bias. Overall meta-analysis showed that ELA significantly reduced reward behaviors (SMD: -0.42 [-0.60; -0.24]). The magnitude of ELA effects significantly increased with longer exposure. When reward domains were analyzed separately, ELA only significantly dampened reward responsiveness (SMD: -0.525[-0.786; -0.264]) and social reward processing (SMD: -0.374 [-0.663; -0.084]), suggesting that ELA might lead to deficits in specific reward domains.",

        "Title": "Integrative multi-omics landscape of fluoxetine action across 27 brain regions reveals global increase in energy metabolism and region-specific chromatin remodelling.",
        "Abstract": "Depression and anxiety are major global health burdens. Although SSRIs targeting the serotonergic system are prescribed over 200 million times annually, they have variable therapeutic efficacy and side effects, and mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood. Here, we comprehensively characterise the molecular landscape of gene regulatory changes associated with fluoxetine, a widely-used SSRI. We performed multimodal analysis of SSRI response in 27 mammalian brain regions using 310 bulk RNA-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq datasets, followed by in-depth characterisation of two hippocampal regions using single-cell RNA-seq (20 datasets). Remarkably, fluoxetine induced profound region-specific shifts in gene expression and chromatin state, including in the nucleus accumbens shell, locus coeruleus and septal areas, as well as in more well-studied regions such as the raphe and hippocampal dentate gyrus. Expression changes were strongly enriched at GWAS loci for depression and antidepressant drug response, stressing the relevance to human phenotypes. We observed differential expression at dozens of signalling receptors and pathways, many of which are previously unknown. Single-cell analysis revealed stark differences in fluoxetine response between the dorsal and ventral hippocampal dentate gyri, particularly in oligodendrocytes, mossy cells and inhibitory neurons. Across diverse brain regions, integrative omics analysis consistently suggested increased energy metabolism via oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial changes, which we corroborated in vitro; this may thus constitute a shared mechanism of action of fluoxetine. Similarly, we observed pervasive chromatin remodelling signatures across the brain. Our study reveals unexpected regional and cell type-specific heterogeneity in SSRI action, highlights under-studied brain regions that may play a major role in antidepressant response, and provides a rich resource of candidate cell types, genes, gene regulatory elements and pathways for mechanistic analysis and identifying new therapeutic targets for depression and anxiety.",

        "Abstract": "Hippocampal neurogenesis is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mouse models. However, it is unknown whether new neurons play a causative role in memory deficits. Here, we show that immature neurons were actively recruited into the engram following a hippocampus-dependent task. However, their recruitment is severely deficient in FAD. Recruited immature neurons exhibited compromised spine density and altered transcript profile. Targeted augmentation of neurogenesis in FAD mice restored the number of new neurons in the engram, the dendritic spine density, and the transcription signature of both immature and mature neurons, ultimately leading to the rescue of memory. Chemogenetic inactivation of immature neurons following enhanced neurogenesis in AD, reversed mouse performance, and diminished memory. Notably, AD-linked App, ApoE, and Adam10 were of the top differentially expressed genes in the engram. Collectively, these observations suggest that defective neurogenesis contributes to memory failure in AD.",

        "Abstract": "Triptans are a class of commonly prescribed antimigraine drugs. Here, we report a previously unrecognized role for them to suppress appetite in mice. In particular, frovatriptan treatment reduces food intake and body weight in diet-induced obese mice. Moreover, the anorectic effect depends on the serotonin (5-HT) 1B receptor (Htr1b). By ablating Htr1b in four different brain regions, we demonstrate that Htr1b engages in spatiotemporally segregated neural pathways to regulate postnatal growth and food intake. Moreover, Htr1b in AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) contributes to the hypophagic effects of HTR1B agonists. To further study the anorexigenic Htr1b circuit, we generated Htr1b-Cre mice. We find that ARH Htr1b neurons bidirectionally regulate food intake in vivo. Furthermore, single-nucleus RNA sequencing analyses revealed that Htr1b marks a subset of AgRP neurons. Finally, we used an intersectional approach to specifically target these neurons (Htr1bAgRP neurons). We show that they regulate food intake, in part, through a Htr1bAgRP\u2192PVH circuit.",

        "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) was previously hypothesized to be a disease of monoamine deficiency in which low levels of monoamines in the synaptic cleft were believed to underlie depressive symptoms. More recently, however, there has been a paradigm shift toward a neuroplasticity hypothesis of depression in which downstream effects of antidepressants, such as increased neurogenesis, contribute to improvements in cognition and mood. This review takes a top-down approach to assess how changes in behavior and hippocampal-dependent circuits may be attributed to abnormalities at the molecular, structural, and synaptic level. We conclude with a discussion of how antidepressant treatments share a common effect in modulating neuroplasticity and consider outstanding questions and future perspectives.",

        "Abstract": "During exploration, animals form an internal map of an environment by combining information about landmarks and the animal's movement, a process that depends on the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus (DG) is the first stage of the hippocampal circuit where self-motion (\"where\") and sensory cue information (\"what\") are integrated, but it remains unknown how DG neurons encode this information during cognitive map formation. Using two-photon calcium imaging in mice running on a treadmill along with online cue manipulation, we identify robust sensory cue responses in DG granule cells. Cue cell responses are stable, stimulus-specific, and accompanied by inhibition of nearby neurons. This demonstrates the existence of \"cue cells\" in addition to better characterized \"place cells\" in the DG. We hypothesize that the DG supports parallel channels of spatial and non-spatial information that contribute distinctly to downstream computations and affect roles of the DG in spatial navigation and episodic memory.",

        "Title": "Mu opioid receptors on hippocampal GABAergic interneurons are critical for the antidepressant effects of tianeptine.",
        "Abstract": "Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant used in Europe to treat patients who respond poorly to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The recent discovery that tianeptine is a mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonist has provided a potential avenue for expanding our understanding of antidepressant treatment beyond the monoamine hypothesis. Thus, our studies aim to understand the neural circuits underlying tianeptine's antidepressant effects. We show that tianeptine induces rapid antidepressant-like effects in mice after as little as one week of treatment. Critically, we also demonstrate that tianeptine's mechanism of action is distinct from fluoxetine in two important aspects: (1) tianeptine requires MORs for its chronic antidepressant-like effect, while fluoxetine does not, and (2) unlike fluoxetine, tianeptine does not promote hippocampal neurogenesis. Using cell-type specific MOR knockouts we further show that MOR expression on GABAergic cells-specifically somatostatin-positive neurons-is necessary for the acute and chronic antidepressant-like responses to tianeptine. Using central infusion of tianeptine, we also implicate the ventral hippocampus as a potential site of antidepressant action. Moreover, we show a dissociation between the antidepressant-like phenotype and other opioid-like phenotypes resulting from acute tianeptine administration such as analgesia, conditioned place preference, and hyperlocomotion. Taken together, these results suggest a novel entry point for understanding what circuit dysregulations may occur in depression, as well as possible targets for the development of new classes of antidepressant drugs.",

The effects of promoting AHN on the recovery of stress-induced symptoms have been well studied, but its involvement in stress resilience remains elusive. We used a mouse model enabling us to foster AHN before the exposure to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) to evaluate the potential protective effects of AHN on stress, assessing the depressive-like phenotype and executive functions.

        "Abstract": "Of Duman's many influential findings, the finding that long-term treatment with antidepressant drugs produces an increase in neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the adult hippocampus may be one of the most enduring and far-reaching. This novel discovery and his decades of continued research in the field led to a new hypothesis about the mechanism of action of antidepressants, providing a critical step in our understanding of the neurotrophic hypothesis of depression and synaptic plasticity. It is now accepted that antidepressant treatments can oppose and even reverse the effects of stress on the brain and on newly born hippocampal cells, possibly via neurotrophic factors, which Duman had continued to explore. Furthermore, ablation studies have shown preclinically that hippocampal neurogenesis may be necessary for some of the clinical effects of antidepressant drugs. Duman's laboratory continued to interrogate neurotrophins and synaptic plasticity, demonstrating that newer clinically approved antidepressant compounds also affect neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In this review, we summarize Duman's original findings and discuss the current state of the field of neurogenesis with respect to animal models and human studies and the implications of those findings on the field of drug discovery.",

        "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder is a common debilitating mental health problem that represents one of the leading causes of disability. Up to date, the therapeutic targets and approaches are still limited. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) has been proposed as a critical contributor to the pathophysiology and treatment of depression, altering the hippocampal control over stress response at network, neuroendocrine and behavioral levels. These findings together have suggested that manipulating AHN may be a promising therapeutic strategy for depression. To investigate this question, we assessed whether increasing adult neurogenesis would be sufficient to produce antidepressant-like effects at behavioral and neuroendocrine levels in a mouse model of depression; the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). For this purpose, we used a bi-transgenic mouse line (iBax) in which AHN increase was induced by deletion of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax from the neural progenitors following the tamoxifen-dependent action of CreERT2 recombinases. UCMS induced a syndrome that is reminiscent of depression-like states, including anhedonia (cookie test), physical changes (coat deterioration, reduced weight gain), anxiety-like behaviors (higher latency in the novelty-supressed feeding -NSF- test), passive stress-coping behaviors (immobility in the forced swim test -FST-) and a blunted hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity to acute stress in addition to AHN decrease. Tamoxifen injection reversed the AHN decrease as well as partly counteracted UCMS effects on the cookie test and HPA axis but not for the coat state, weight gain, NSF test and FST. Taken together, our results suggest that a strategy directing at increasing AHN may be able to alleviate some depression-related behavioral and neuroendocrine dimensions of UCMS, such as anhedonia and HPA axis reactivity deficits, but may be hardly sufficient to produce a complete recovery.",

        "Abstract": "Neurons are often considered specialized functional units that encode a single variable. However, many neurons are observed to respond to a mix of disparate sensory, cognitive, and behavioral variables. For such representations, information is distributed across multiple neurons. Here we find this distributed code in the dentate gyrus and CA1 subregions of the hippocampus. Using calcium imaging in freely moving mice, we decoded an animal's position, direction of motion, and speed from the activity of hundreds of cells. The response properties of individual neurons were only partially predictive of their importance for encoding position. Non-place cells encoded position and contributed to position encoding when combined with other cells. Indeed, disrupting the correlations between neural activities decreased decoding performance, mostly in CA1. Our analysis indicates that population methods rather than classical analyses based on single-cell response properties may more accurately characterize the neural code in the hippocampus.",

        "Title": "Contributions of adult neurogenesis to dentate gyrus network activity and computations.",
        "Abstract": "Anatomical observations, theoretical work and lesion experiments have led to the idea that an important function of the dentate gyrus of the mammalian hippocampus is pattern separation, a neural computation that ensures new memories are encoded without interference from previously stored memories that share similar features. The dentate gyrus also exhibits a unique form of neural plasticity that results from the continuous integration of newly born excitatory granule cells, termed adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However, the manner in which adult neurogenesis contributes to dentate gyrus network activity and computations is incompletely understood. Here, we first describe the prevailing models for the role of adult neurogenesis in dentate gyrus network function and then re-evaluate these models in the light of recent findings regarding the in vivo activity of the dentate gyrus and synaptic interactions of adult born granule cells with local circuit components, as well as, inputs, and outputs of the dentate gyrus. We propose that adult neurogenesis provides flexibility for the dentate gyrus to rapidly generate a context specific, distributed representation of important sensory stimuli such as spatial cues, which ultimately gives rise to behavioral discrimination.",

However, it remains unclear how abGCs distinctively contribute to local DG information processing. We found that the actions of abGCs in the DG depend on the origin of incoming afferents. In response to lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) inputs, abGCs exert monosynaptic inhibition of mature granule cells (mGCs) through group II metabotropic glutamate receptors. By contrast, in response to medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) inputs, abGCs directly excite mGCs through ",

        "Abstract": "The serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1A) system has been extensively implicated in modulating mood and behavior. Notably, 5-HT1A levels in humans display remarkable variation, and differences in receptor levels have been linked with a variety of psychiatric disorders. Further, reduction of receptor levels by 30-50% in mice suggests that changes in receptor levels that model existing human variation are sufficient to drive behavioral alterations. As a result, genetic mechanisms that modulate human 5-HT1A levels may be important for explaining individual differences in mood and behavior, representing a potential source of psychiatric disease risk. One common genetic variant implicated in differential 5-HT1A levels is the G/C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6295, located upstream of the human 5-HT1A gene. This SNP differentially binds the transcription factor, NUDR/Deaf1, leading to cell-type specific effects on transcription in vitro. To investigate the direct effects of this SNP in the heterogeneous cellular context of the brain, we generated humanized transgenic mice using a design that maximized the local transcriptional landscape of the human HTR1A gene while also controlling for effects of genomic insertion location. We integrated a 180 kb human bacteria artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene containing G- and C-alleles of rs6295 flanked by FRT or loxP sites. Subsequent deletion of each allele by Cre- or Flp-recombinase resulted in rs6295G and C alleles in the same genomic location. These alleles were bred onto a 5-HT1A null mouse such that the human BAC was the sole source of 5-HT1A in these mice. We generated three separate lines, two of which had detectable human 5-HT1A levels in the brain, although none displayed expression in the raphe. Of these, one line exhibited rs6295-dependent differences in 5-HT1A levels and differences in behavior, even though the overall levels were considerably lower than native expression levels. The line-dependent effect of rs6295 on protein levels and behavior may depend upon differences in background genetic factors or different insertion sites across each line. This work confirms that relatively subtle differences in 5-HT1A levels can contribute to differences in behavior and highlights the challenges of modeling human noncoding genetic variation in mice.",

        "Abstract": "Stress exposure is associated with the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Here, we show in rodents that chronic stress exposure rapidly and transiently elevates hippocampal expression of Kruppel-like factor 9 (Klf9). Inducible genetic silencing of Klf9 expression in excitatory forebrain neurons in adulthood prior to, but not after, onset of stressor prevented chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced potentiation of contextual fear acquisition in female mice and chronic corticosterone (CORT) exposure-induced fear generalization in male mice. Klf9 silencing prevented chronic CORT and CRS induced enlargement of dendritic spines in the ventral hippocampus of male and female mice, respectively. KLF9 mRNA density was increased in the anterior dentate gyrus of women, but not men, with more severe recent stressful life events and increased mortality. Thus, Klf9 functions as a stress-responsive transcription factor that mediates circuit and behavioral resilience in a sex-specific manner.",

        "Abstract": "The 5-HT1A autoreceptor mediates feedback inhibition of serotonin (5-HT) neurons, and is implicated in major depression. The human 5-HT1A gene (HTR1A) rs6295 risk allele prevents Deaf1 binding to HTR1A, resulting in increased 5-HT1A autoreceptor transcription. Since chronic stress alters HTR1A methylation and expression, we addressed whether recruitment of methyl-binding protein MeCP2 may alter Deaf1 regulation at the HTR1A locus. We show that MeCP2 enhances Deaf1 binding to its HTR1A site and co-immunoprecipitates with Deaf1 in cells and brain tissue. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed Deaf1-dependent recruitment of MeCP2 to the mouse HTR1A promoter, and MeCP2 modulated human and mouse HTR1A gene transcription in a Deaf1-dependent fashion, enhancing Deaf1-induced repression at the Deaf1 site. To address the role of MeCP2 in HTR1A regulation in vivo, mice with conditional knockout of MeCP2 in adult 5-HT neurons (MeCP2 cKO) were generated. These mice exhibited increased 5-HT1A autoreceptor levels and function, consistent with MeCP2 enhancement of Deaf1 repression in 5-HT neurons. Interestingly, female MeCP2-cKO mice displayed reduced anxiety, while males showed increased anxiety and reduced depression-like behaviors. These data uncover a novel role for MeCP2 in 5-HT neurons to repress HTR1A expression and drive adult anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in a sex-specific manner.",

        "Abstract": "Adult hippocampal neurogenesis declines in aging rodents and primates. Aging humans are thought to exhibit waning neurogenesis and exercise-induced angiogenesis, with a resulting volumetric decrease in the neurogenic hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) region, although concurrent changes in these parameters are not well studied. Here we assessed whole autopsy hippocampi from healthy human individuals ranging from 14 to 79 years of age. We found similar numbers of intermediate neural progenitors and thousands of immature neurons in the DG, comparable numbers of glia and mature granule neurons, and equivalent DG volume across ages. Nevertheless, older individuals have less angiogenesis and neuroplasticity and a smaller quiescent progenitor pool in anterior-mid DG, with no changes in posterior DG. Thus, healthy older subjects without cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric disease, or treatment display preserved neurogenesis. It is possible that ongoing hippocampal neurogenesis sustains human-specific cognitive function throughout life and that declines may be linked to compromised cognitive-emotional resilience.",

        "Abstract": "In vivo calcium imaging through microendoscopic lenses enables imaging of previously inaccessible neuronal populations deep within the brains of freely moving animals. However, it is computationally challenging to extract single-neuronal activity from microendoscopic data, because of the very large background fluctuations and high spatial overlaps intrinsic to this recording modality. Here, we describe a new constrained matrix factorization approach to accurately separate the background and then demix and denoise the neuronal signals of interest. We compared the proposed method against previous independent components analysis and constrained nonnegative matrix factorization approaches. On both simulated and experimental data recorded from mice, our method substantially improved the quality of extracted cellular signals and detected more well-isolated neural signals, especially in noisy data regimes. These advances can in turn significantly enhance the statistical power of downstream analyses, and ultimately improve scientific conclusions derived from microendoscopic data.",

        "Abstract": "The hippocampus is traditionally thought to transmit contextual information to limbic structures where it acquires valence. Using freely moving calcium imaging and optogenetics, we show that while the dorsal CA1 subregion of the hippocampus is enriched in place cells, ventral CA1 (vCA1) is enriched in anxiety cells that are activated by anxiogenic environments and required for avoidance behavior. Imaging cells defined by their projection target revealed that anxiety cells were enriched in the vCA1 population projecting to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) but not to the basal amygdala (BA). Consistent with this selectivity, optogenetic activation of vCA1 terminals in LHA but not BA increased anxiety and avoidance, while activation of terminals in BA but not LHA impaired contextual fear memory. Thus, the hippocampus encodes not only neutral but also valence-related contextual information, and the vCA1-LHA pathway is a direct route by which the hippocampus can rapidly influence innate anxiety behavior.",

In the mouse, we recently demonstrated that dorsal DG (dDG) stimulation enhances exploratory behavior (Kheirbek et al., 2013). Dopamine (DA) release in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc), which belongs to the reward system, could be a key target of dDG mediating this motivation-related behavior. Here, an optogenetic stimulation of either ventral (vDG) or dDG granule cells was coupled with NAcc DA release monitoring using in vivo microdialysis. Only dDG stimulation enhanced NAcc DA release, indicating differential interconnections between dDG and vDG to the reward system.",

        "Abstract": "Historically, preclinical stress studies have often omitted female subjects, despite evidence that women have higher rates of anxiety and depression. In rodents, many stress susceptibility and resilience studies have focused on males as one commonly used paradigm-chronic social defeat stress-has proven challenging to implement in females. We report a new version of the social defeat paradigm that works in female mice. By applying male odorants to females to increase resident male aggressive behavior, we find that female mice undergo repeated social defeat stress and develop social avoidance, decreased sucrose preference, and decreased time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze relative to control mice. Moreover, a subset of the female mice in this paradigm display resilience, maintaining control levels of social exploration and sucrose preference. This method produces comparable results to those obtained in male mice and will greatly facilitate studying female stress susceptibility.",

        "Title": "Increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice after exposure to unpredictable chronic mild stress may counteract some of the effects of stress.",
        "Abstract": "Major depression is hypothesized to be associated with dysregulations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and impairments in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Adult-born hippocampal neurons are required for several effects of antidepressants and increasing the rate of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) before exposure to chronic corticosterone is sufficient to protect against its harmful effects on behavior. However, it is an open question if increasing AHN after the onset of chronic stress exposure would be able to rescue behavioral deficits and which mechanisms might be involved in recovery. We investigated this question by using a 10-week unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model on a transgenic mouse line (iBax mice), in which the pro-apoptotic gene Bax can be inducibly ablated in neural stem cells following Tamoxifen injection, therefore enhancing the survival of newborn neurons in the adult brain. We did not observe any effect of our treatment in non-stress conditions, but we did find that increasing AHN after 2 weeks of UCMS is sufficient to counteract the effects of UCMS on certain behaviors (splash test and changes in coat state) and endocrine levels and thus to display some antidepressant-like effects. We observed that increasing AHN lowered the elevated basal corticosterone levels in mice exposed to UCMS. This was accompanied by a tamoxifen-induced reversal of the lack of stress-induced decrease in neuronal activation in the anteromedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTMA) after intrahippocampal dexamethasone infusion, pointing to a possible mechanism through which adult-born neurons might have exerted their effects. Our results contribute to the neurogenesis hypothesis of depression by suggesting that increasing AHN may be beneficial not just before, but also after exposure to stress by counteracting several of its effects, in part through regulating the HPA axis.",

        "Abstract": "An estimated 50% of depressed patients are inadequately treated by available interventions. Even with an eventual recovery, many patients require a trial and error approach, as there are no reliable guidelines to match patients to optimal treatments and many patients develop treatment resistance over time. This situation derives from the heterogeneity of depression and the lack of biomarkers for stratification by distinct depression subtypes. There is thus a dire need for novel therapies. To address these known challenges, we propose a multi-scale framework for fundamental research on depression, aimed at identifying the brain circuits that are dysfunctional in several animal models of depression as well the changes in gene expression that are associated with these models. When combined with human genetic and imaging studies, our preclinical studies are starting to identify candidate circuits and molecules that are altered both in models of disease and in patient populations.

        "Abstract": "Gambling disorder (GD), previously called pathological gambling and classified as an impulse control disorder in DSM-III and DSM-IV, has recently been reclassified as an addictive disorder in the DSM-5. It is widely recognized as an important public health problem associated with substantial personal and social costs, high rates of psychiatric comorbidity, poor physical health, and elevated suicide rates. A number of risk factors have been identified, including some genetic polymorphisms. Animal models have been developed in order to study the underlying neural basis of GD. Here, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the risk factors, disease course, and pathophysiology. A focus on a phenotype-based dissection of the disorder is included in which known neural correlates from animal and human studies are reviewed. Finally, current treatment approaches are discussed, as well as future directions for GD research.",

        "Abstract": "Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in cognitive processes, such as pattern separation, and in the behavioural effects of stress and antidepressants. Young adult-born neurons have been shown to inhibit the overall activity of the dentate gyrus by recruiting local interneurons, which may result in sparse contextual representations and improved pattern separation. We propose that neurogenesis-mediated inhibition also reduces memory interference and enables reversal learning both in neutral situations and in emotionally charged ones. Such improved cognitive flexibility may in turn help to decrease anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviour.",

        "Abstract": "Depression is a debilitating chronic illness that affects around 350 million people worldwide. Current treatments, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are not ideal because only a fraction of patients achieve remission. Tianeptine is an effective antidepressant with a previously unknown mechanism of action. We recently reported that tianeptine is a full agonist at the mu opioid receptor (MOR). Here we demonstrate that the acute and chronic antidepressant-like behavioral effects of tianeptine in mice require MOR. Interestingly, while tianeptine also produces many opiate-like behavioral effects such as analgesia and reward, it does not lead to tolerance or withdrawal. Furthermore, the primary metabolite of tianeptine (MC5), which has a longer half-life, mimics the behavioral effects of tianeptine in a MOR-dependent fashion. These results point to the possibility that MOR and its downstream signaling cascades may be novel targets for antidepressant drug development.",

Two behavioral features often considered in impulsive behavior are behavioral inhibition (impulsive action) and delayed gratification (impulsive choice). However, the extent to which these behavioral constructs represent distinct facets of behavior with discrete biological bases is unclear. To test the hypothesis that impulsive action and impulsive choice represent statistically independent behavioral constructs in mice, we collected behavioral measures of impulsivity in a single cohort of mice using well-validated operant behavioral paradigms.

        "Abstract": "The neural circuit mechanisms underlying the integration and functions of adult-born dentate granule cell (DGCs) are poorly understood. Adult-born DGCs are thought to compete with mature DGCs for inputs to integrate. Transient genetic overexpression of a negative regulator of dendritic spines, Kruppel-like factor 9 (Klf9), in mature DGCs enhanced integration of adult-born DGCs and increased NSC\u00a0activation. Reversal of Klf9 overexpression in mature\u00a0DGCs restored spines and activity and reset neuronal competition dynamics and NSC activation, leaving the DG modified by a functionally integrated, expanded cohort of age-matched adult-born DGCs. Spine elimination by inducible deletion of Rac1 in mature DGCs increased survival of adult-born DGCs without affecting proliferation or DGC activity. Enhanced integration of adult-born DGCs transiently reorganized adult-born DGC local afferent connectivity and promoted global remapping in the DG. Rejuvenation of the DG by enhancing integration of\u00a0adult-born DGCs in adulthood, middle age, and aging enhanced memory precision.",

        "Abstract": "Ablation of adult neurogenesis in mice has revealed that young adult-born granule cells (abGCs) are required for some of the behavioral responses to antidepressants (ADs), yet the mechanism by which abGCs contribute to AD action remains unknown. During their maturation process, these immature neurons exhibit unique properties that could underlie their ability to influence behavioral output. In particular, abGCs in the DG exhibit a period of heightened plasticity 4-6 weeks after birth that is mediated by GluN2B-expressing NMDA receptors. The functional contribution of this critical window to AD responsiveness is unclear. Here, we determined the behavioral and neurogenic responses to the AD fluoxetine (FLX) in mice lacking GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in abGCs. We found that these mice exhibited an attenuated response to FLX in a neurogenesis-dependent behavioral assay of FLX action, while neurogenesis-independent behaviors were unaffected by GluN2B deletion. In addition, deletion of GluN2B attenuated FLX-induced increases in dendritic complexity of abGCs suggesting that the blunted behavioral efficacy of FLX may be caused by impaired differentiation of young abGCs.",

Here, we have used two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of young abGCs in awake behaving mice. We find that young adult-born neurons fire at a higher rate in\u00a0vivo but paradoxically exhibit less spatial tuning than their mature counterparts. When presented with different contexts, mature granule cells underwent robust remapping of their spatial representations, and the few spatially tuned adult-born cells remapped to a similar degree. We next used optogenetic silencing to confirm the direct involvement of abGCs in context encoding and discrimination, consistent with their proposed role in pattern separation. These results provide the first in\u00a0vivo characterization of abGCs and reveal their participation in the encoding of novel information.",

        "Title": "Genetic Pharmacotherapy as an Early CNS Drug Development Strategy: Testing Glutaminase Inhibition for Schizophrenia Treatment in Adult Mice.",
        "Abstract": "Genetic pharmacotherapy is an early drug development strategy for the identification of novel CNS targets in mouse models prior to the development of specific ligands. Here for the first time, we have implemented this strategy to address the potential therapeutic value of a glutamate-based pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia involving inhibition of the glutamate recycling enzyme phosphate-activated glutaminase. Mice constitutively heterozygous for GLS1, the gene encoding glutaminase, manifest a schizophrenia resilience phenotype, a key dimension of which is an attenuated locomotor response to propsychotic amphetamine challenge. If resilience is due to glutaminase deficiency in adulthood, then glutaminase inhibitors should have therapeutic potential. However, this has been difficult to test given the dearth of neuroactive glutaminase inhibitors. So, we used genetic pharmacotherapy to ask whether adult induction of GLS1 heterozygosity would attenuate amphetamine responsiveness. We generated conditional floxGLS1 mice and crossed them with global CAG(ERT2cre\u2215+) mice to produce GLS1 iHET mice, susceptible to tamoxifen induction of GLS1 heterozygosity. One month after tamoxifen treatment of adult GLS1 iHET mice, we found a 50% reduction in GLS1 allelic abundance and glutaminase mRNA levels in the brain. While GLS1 iHET mice showed some recombination prior to tamoxifen, there was no impact on mRNA levels. We then asked whether induction of GLS heterozygosity would attenuate the locomotor response to propsychotic amphetamine challenge. Before tamoxifen, control and GLS1 iHET mice did not differ in their response to amphetamine. One month after tamoxifen treatment, amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion was blocked in GLS1 iHET mice. The block was largely maintained after 5 months. Thus, a genetically induced glutaminase reduction-mimicking pharmacological inhibition-strongly attenuated the response to a propsychotic challenge, suggesting that glutaminase may be a novel target for the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia. These results demonstrate how genetic pharmacotherapy can be implemented to test a CNS target in advance of the development of specific neuroactive inhibitors. We discuss further the advantages, limitations, and feasibility of the wider application of genetic pharmacotherapy for neuropsychiatric drug development.",

        "Abstract": "Robust incorporation of new principal cells into pre-existing circuitry in the adult mammalian brain is unique to the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). We asked if adult-born granule cells (GCs) might act to regulate processing within the DG by modulating the substantially more abundant mature GCs. Optogenetic stimulation of a cohort of young adult-born GCs (0 to 7 weeks post-mitosis) revealed that these cells activate local GABAergic interneurons to evoke strong inhibitory input to mature GCs. Natural manipulation of neurogenesis by aging-to decrease it-and housing in an enriched environment-to increase it-strongly affected the levels of inhibition. We also demonstrated that elevating activity in adult-born GCs in awake behaving animals reduced the overall number of mature GCs activated by exploration. These data suggest that inhibitory modulation of mature GCs may be an important function of adult-born hippocampal neurons. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "Abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used antidepressants, but the mechanisms by which they influence behavior are only partially resolved. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is necessary for some of the responses to SSRIs, but it is not known whether mature dentate gyrus granule cells (DG GCs) also contribute. We deleted the serotonin 1A receptor (5HT1AR, a receptor required for the SSRI response) specifically from DG GCs and found that the effects of the SSRI fluoxetine on behavior and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were abolished. By contrast, mice lacking 5HT1ARs only in young adult-born GCs (abGCs) showed normal fluoxetine responses. Notably, 5HT1AR-deficient mice engineered to express functional 5HT1ARs only in DG GCs responded to fluoxetine, indicating that 5HT1ARs in DG GCs are sufficient to mediate an antidepressant response. Taken together, these data indicate that both mature DG GCs and young abGCs must be engaged for an antidepressant response.",

        "Abstract": "Degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) causes hypokinesia, but DA replacement therapy can elicit exaggerated voluntary and involuntary behaviors that have been attributed to enhanced DA receptor sensitivity in striatal projection neurons. Here we reveal that in hemiparkinsonian mice, striatal D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs) directly projecting to the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) lose tonic presynaptic inhibition by GABAB receptors. The absence of presynaptic GABAB response potentiates evoked GABA release from MSN efferents to the SNr and drives motor sensitization. This alternative mechanism of sensitization suggests a synaptic target for PD pharmacotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "Normal aging and exercise exert extensive, often opposing, effects on the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus altering volume, synaptic function, and behaviors. The DG is especially important for behaviors requiring pattern separation-a cognitive process that enables animals to differentiate between highly similar contextual experiences. To determine how age and exercise modulate pattern separation in an aversive setting, young, aged, and aged mice provided with a running wheel were assayed on a fear-based contextual discrimination task. Aged mice showed a profound impairment in contextual discrimination compared to young animals. Voluntary exercise rescued this deficit to such an extent that behavioral pattern separation of aged-run mice was now similar to young animals. Running also resulted in a significant increase in the number of immature neurons with tertiary dendrites in aged mice. Despite this, neurogenesis levels in aged-run mice were still considerably lower than in young animals. Thus, mechanisms other than DG neurogenesis likely play significant roles in improving behavioral pattern separation elicited by exercise in aged animals.",

        "Abstract": "The full role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) remains to be determined, yet it is implicated in learning and emotional functions, and is disrupted in negative mood disorders. Recent evidence indicates that AHN is decreased in persistent pain consistent with the idea that chronic pain is a major stressor, associated with negative moods and abnormal memories. Yet, the role of AHN in development of persistent pain has remained unexplored. In this study, we test the influence of AHN in postinjury inflammatory and neuropathic persistent pain-like behaviors by manipulating neurogenesis: pharmacologically through intracerebroventricular infusion of the antimitotic AraC; ablation of AHN by x-irradiation; and using transgenic mice with increased or decreased AHN. Downregulating neurogenesis reversibly diminished or blocked persistent pain; oppositely, upregulating neurogenesis led to prolonged persistent pain. Moreover, we could dissociate negative mood from persistent pain. These results suggest that AHN-mediated hippocampal learning mechanisms are involved in the emergence of persistent pain.",

        "Title": "Experience-Dependent Regulation of Dentate Gyrus Excitability by Adult-Born Granule Cells.",
        "Abstract": "Behavioral studies have established a role for adult-born dentate granule cells in discriminating between similar memories. However, it is unclear how these cells mediate memory discrimination. Excitability is enhanced in maturing adult-born neurons, spurring the hypothesis that the activity of these cells \"directly\" encodes and stores memories. An alternative hypothesis posits that maturing neurons \"indirectly\" contribute to memory encoding by regulating excitation-inhibition balance. We evaluated these alternatives by using dentate-sensitive active place avoidance tasks to assess experience-dependent changes in dentate field potentials in the presence and absence of neurogenesis. Before training, X-ray ablation of adult neurogenesis-reduced dentate responses to perforant-path stimulation and shifted EPSP-spike coupling leftward. These differences were unchanged after place avoidance training with the shock zone in the initial location, which both groups learned to avoid equally well. In contrast, sham-treated mice decreased dentate responses and shifted EPSP-spike coupling leftward after the shock zone was relocated, whereas X-irradiated mice failed to show these changes in dentate function and were impaired on this test of memory discrimination. During place avoidance, excitation-inhibition coupled neural synchrony in dentate local field potentials was reduced in X-irradiated mice, especially in the \u03b8 band. The difference was most prominent during conflict learning, which is impaired in the X-irradiated mice. These findings indicate that maturing adult-born neurons regulate both functional network plasticity in response to memory discrimination and dentate excitation-inhibition coordination. The most parsimonious interpretation of these results is that adult neurogenesis indirectly regulates hippocampal information processing.",

In this review, we suggest that the diversity in behavioral requirements for new neurons may be partly caused by separate functional roles of individual neurogenic niches. Growing evidence shows that the hippocampal formation can be compartmentalized not only along the classic trisynaptic circuit, but also along a longitudinal septotemporal axis. We suggest that subpopulations of hippocampal adult-born neurons may be specialized for distinct mnemonic- or mood-related behavioral tasks. We will examine the literature supporting a functional and anatomical dissociation of the hippocampus along the longitudinal axis and discuss techniques to functionally dissect the roles of adult-born hippocampal neurons in these distinct subregions.",

        "Abstract": "Impulsive and aggressive behaviors are both modulated by serotonergic signaling, specifically through the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR). 5-HT1BR knockout mice show increased aggression and impulsivity, and 5-HT1BR polymorphisms are associated with aggression and drug addiction in humans. To dissect the mechanisms by which the 5-HT1BR affects these phenotypes, we developed a mouse model to spatially and temporally regulate 5-HT1BR expression. Our results demonstrate that forebrain 5-HT1B heteroreceptors expressed during an early postnatal period contribute to the development of the neural systems underlying adult aggression. However, distinct heteroreceptors acting during adulthood are involved in mediating impulsivity. Correlating with the impulsivity, dopamine in the nucleus accumbens is elevated in the absence of 5-HT1BRs and normalized following adult rescue of the receptor. Overall, these data show that while adolescent expression of 5-HT1BRs influences aggressive behavior, a distinct set of 5-HT1B receptors modulates impulsive behavior during adulthood.",

        "Abstract": "Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is increased by antidepressants, and is required for some of their behavioral effects. However, it remains unclear whether expanding the population of adult-born neurons is sufficient to affect anxiety and depression-related behavior. Here, we use an inducible transgenic mouse model in which the pro-apoptotic gene Bax is deleted from neural stem cells and their progeny in the adult brain, and thereby increases adult neurogenesis. We find no effects on baseline anxiety and depression-related behavior; however, we find that increasing adult neurogenesis is sufficient to reduce anxiety and depression-related behaviors in mice treated chronically with corticosterone (CORT), a mouse model of stress. Thus, neurogenesis differentially affects behavior under baseline conditions and in a model of chronic stress. Moreover, we find no effect of increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation, either at baseline or following chronic CORT administration, suggesting that increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis can affect anxiety and depression-related behavior through a mechanism independent of the HPA axis. The use of future techniques to specifically inhibit BAX in the hippocampus could be used to augment adult neurogenesis, and may therefore represent a novel strategy to promote antidepressant-like behavioral effects.",

        "Abstract": "The hippocampus has long been known as a brain structure fundamental for memory formation and retrieval. Recent technological advances of cellular tracing techniques and optogenetic manipulation strategies have allowed to unravel important aspects of the cellular origin of memory, and have started to shed new light on the neuronal networks involved in encoding, consolidation and retrieval of memory in the hippocampus. In particular, memory traces, or engrams, that are formed during encoding in the dentate gyrus and CA3 region are crucial for memory retrieval and amenable to modulation by neuroplastic mechanisms, including adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we will discuss how memory traces are being encoded at the cellular level, how they may contribute to pattern separation and pattern completion in the hippocampus, and how they can be associated with different experiences to express memories of opposite valence. We propose a mechanism by which adult hippocampal neurogenesis may contribute to the formation of engrams, which may be relevant not only for the encoding of contextual information, but also for mood abnormalities, such as anxiety and depression.",

        "Abstract": "Knockout (KO) mice that lack the dopamine transporter (SL6A3; DAT) display increased locomotion that can be attenuated, under some circumstances, by administration of drugs that normally produce psychostimulant-like effects, such as amphetamine and methylphenidate. These results have led to suggestions that DAT KO mice may model features of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and that these drugs may act upon serotonin (5-HT) systems to produce these unusual locomotor decreasing effects. Evidence from patterns of brain expression and initial pharmacologic studies led us to use genetic and pharmacologic approaches to examine the influence of altered 5-HT1B receptor activity on hyperactivity in DAT KO mice. Heterozygous 5-HT1B KO and pharmacologic 5-HT1B antagonism both attenuated locomotor hyperactivity in DAT KO mice. Furthermore, DAT KO mice with reduced, but not eliminated, 5-HT1B receptor expression regained cocaine-stimulated locomotion, which was absent in DAT KO mice with normal levels of 5-HT1B receptor expression. Further experiments demonstrated that the degree of habituation to the testing apparatus determined whether cocaine had no effect on locomotion in DAT KO or reduced locomotion, helping to resolve differences among prior reports. These findings of complementation of the locomotor effects of DAT KO by reducing 5-HT1B receptor activity underscore roles for interactions between specific 5-HT receptors and dopamine (DA) systems in basal and cocaine-stimulated locomotion and support evaluation of 5-HT1B antagonists as potential, non-stimulant ADHD therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the mostly widely used treatment for major depressive disorders and also are prescribed for several anxiety disorders. However, similar to most antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors suffer from two major problems: They only show beneficial effects after 2 to 4 weeks and only about 33% of patients show remission to first-line treatment. Thus, there is a considerable need for development of more effective antidepressants. There is a growing body of evidence supporting critical roles of 5-HT1A and 5-HT4 receptor subtypes in mediating successful depression treatments. In addition, appropriate activation of these receptors may be associated with a faster onset of the therapeutic response. This review will examine the known roles of 5-HT1A and 5-HT4 receptors in mediating both the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety and the treatment of these mood disorders. At the end of the review, the role of these receptors in the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis will also be discussed. Ultimately, we propose that novel antidepressant drugs that selectively target these serotonin receptors could be developed to yield improvements over current treatments for major depressive disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Adult neurogenesis, the generation of new neurons in the adult brain, occurs in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and the olfactory bulb (OB) of all mammals, but the functions of these new neurons are not entirely clear. Originally, adult-born neurons were considered to have excitatory effects on the DG network, but recent studies suggest a net inhibitory effect. Therefore, we hypothesized that selective removal of newborn neurons would lead to increased susceptibility to the effects of a convulsant. This hypothesis was tested by evaluating the response to the chemoconvulsant kainic acid (KA) in mice with reduced adult neurogenesis, produced either by focal X-irradiation of the DG, or by pharmacogenetic deletion of dividing radial glial precursors. In the first 4 hrs after KA administration, when mice have the most robust seizures, mice with reduced adult neurogenesis had more severe convulsive seizures, exhibited either as a decreased latency to the first convulsive seizure, greater number of convulsive seizures, or longer convulsive seizures. Nonconvulsive seizures did not appear to change or they decreased. Four-21 hrs after KA injection, mice with reduced adult neurogenesis showed more interictal spikes (IIS) and delayed seizures than controls. Effects were greater when the anticonvulsant ethosuximide was injected 30 min prior to KA administration; ethosuximide allows forebrain seizure activity to be more easily examined in mice by suppressing seizures dominated by the brainstem. These data support the hypothesis that reduction of adult-born neurons increases the susceptibility of the brain to effects of KA.",

        "Abstract": "Innate behaviours are observed in naive animals without prior learning or experience, suggesting that the neural circuits that mediate these behaviours are genetically determined and stereotyped. The neural circuits that convey olfactory information from the sense organ to the cortical and subcortical olfactory centres have been anatomically defined, but the specific pathways responsible for innate responses to volatile odours have not been identified. Here we devise genetic strategies that demonstrate that a stereotyped neural circuit that transmits information from the olfactory bulb to cortical amygdala is necessary for innate aversive and appetitive behaviours. Moreover, we use the promoter of the activity-dependent gene arc to express the photosensitive ion channel, channelrhodopsin, in neurons of the cortical amygdala activated by odours that elicit innate behaviours. Optical activation of these neurons leads to appropriate behaviours that recapitulate the responses to innate odours. These data indicate that the cortical amygdala plays a critical role in generating innate odour-driven behaviours but do not preclude its participation in learned olfactory behaviours.",

        "Abstract": "Newborn neurons are continuously added to the adult hippocampus. Early studies found that adult neurogenesis is impaired in models of depression and anxiety and accelerated by antidepressant treatment. This led to the theory that depression results from impaired adult neurogenesis and restoration of adult neurogenesis leads to recovery. Follow up studies yielded a complex body of often inconsistent results, and the veracity of this theory is uncertain. We propose five criteria for acceptance of this theory, we review the recent evidence for each criterion, and we draw the following conclusions: Diverse animal models of depression and anxiety have impaired neurogenesis. Neurogenesis is consistently boosted by antidepressants in animal models only when animals are stressed. Ablation of neurogenesis in animal models impairs cognitive functions relevant to depression, but only a minority of studies find that ablation causes depression or anxiety. Recent human neuroimaging and postmortem studies are consistent with the neurogenic theory, but they are indirect. Finally, a novel drug developed based on the neurogenic theory is promising in animal models.",

To visualize memory traces, we created a transgenic line that allows for the comparison between cells activated during encoding and expression of a memory. Mice re-exposed to a fear-inducing context froze more and had a greater percentage of reactivated cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 than mice exposed to a novel context. Over time, these differences disappeared, in keeping with the observation that memories become generalized. Optogenetically silencing DG or CA3 cells that were recruited during encoding of a fear-inducing context prevented expression of the corresponding memory. Mice with reduced neurogenesis displayed less contextual memory and less reactivation in CA3 but, surprisingly, normal reactivation in the DG. These studies suggest that distinct memory traces are located in the DG and in CA3 but that the strength of the memory is related to reactivation in CA3.",

        "Abstract": "Modest antidepressant response rates of mood disorders (MD) encourage benzodiazepine (BZD) co-medication with debatable benefit. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis may underlie antidepressant responses, but diazepam co-administration impairs murine neuron maturation and survival in response to fluoxetine. We counted neural progenitor cells (NPCs), mitotic cells, and mature granule neurons post-mortem in dentate gyrus (DG) from subjects with: untreated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV MD (n = 17); antidepressant-treated MD (MD*ADT, n = 10); benzodiazepine-antidepressant-treated MD (MD*ADT*BZD, n = 7); no psychopathology or treatment (controls, n = 18). MD*ADT*BZD had fewer granule neurons vs. MD*ADT in anterior DG and vs. controls in mid DG, and did not differ from untreated-MD in any DG subregion. MD*ADT had more granule neurons than untreated-MD in anterior and mid DG and comparable granule neuron number to controls in all dentate subregions. Untreated-MD had fewer granule neurons than controls in anterior and mid DG, and did not differ from any other group in posterior DG. MD*ADT*BZD had fewer NPCs vs. MD*ADT in mid DG. MD*ADT had more NPCs vs. untreated-MD and controls in anterior and mid DG. MD*ADT*BZD and MD*ADT had more mitotic cells in anterior DG vs. controls and untreated-MD. There were no between-group differences in mid DG in mitotic cells or in posterior DG for any cell type. Our results in mid-dentate, and to some degree anterior dentate, gyrus are consistent with murine findings that benzodiazepines counteract antidepressant-induced increases in neurogenesis by interfering with progenitor proliferation. We also confirmed, in this expanded sample, our previous finding of granule neuron deficit in untreated MD.",

        "Abstract": "Psychiatric genetics research is bidirectional in nature, with human and animal studies becoming more closely integrated as techniques for genetic manipulations allow for more subtle exploration of disease phenotypes. This synergy highlights the importance of considering the way in which we approach the genotype-phenotype relationship. In particular, the nosologic divide of psychiatric illness, although clinically relevant, is not directly translatable in animal models. For instance, mice will never fully recapitulate the broad criteria for many psychiatric disorders; additionally, mice will never have guilty ruminations, suicidal thoughts, or rapid speech. Instead, animal models have been and continue to provide a means to explore dimensions of psychiatric disorders to identify neural circuits and mechanisms underlying disease-relevant phenotypes. The genetic investigation of psychiatric illness can yield the greatest insights if efforts continue to identify and use biologically valid phenotypes across species. This review discusses the progress to date and the future efforts that will enhance translation between human and animal studies, including the identification of intermediate phenotypes that can be studied across species and the importance of refined modeling of human disease-associated genetic variation in mice and other animal models.",

        "Abstract": "Fear memories guide adaptive behavior in contexts associated with aversive events. The hippocampus forms a neural representation of the context that predicts aversive events. Representations of context incorporate multisensory features of the environment, but must somehow exclude sensory features of the aversive event itself. We investigated this selectivity using cell type-specific imaging and inactivation in hippocampal area CA1 of behaving mice. Aversive stimuli activated CA1 dendrite-targeting interneurons via cholinergic input, leading to inhibition of pyramidal cell distal dendrites receiving aversive sensory excitation from the entorhinal cortex. Inactivating dendrite-targeting interneurons during aversive stimuli increased CA1 pyramidal cell population responses and prevented fear learning. We propose subcortical activation of dendritic inhibition as a mechanism for exclusion of aversive stimuli from hippocampal contextual representations during fear learning.",

        "Abstract": "Adult-born granule cells in the mammalian dentate gyrus have long been implicated in hippocampal dependent spatial learning and behavioral effects of chronic antidepressant treatment. Although recent anatomical and functional evidence indicates a dissociation of the dorsal and ventral regions of the hippocampus, it is not known if adult neurogenesis within each region specifically contributes to distinct functions or whether adult-born cells along the entire dorsoventral axis are required for these behaviors. We examined the role of distinct subpopulations of adult-born hippocampal granule cells in learning- and anxiety-related behaviors using low-dose focal x-irradiation directed specifically to the dorsal or ventral dentate gyrus. Our findings indicate a functional dissociation between adult-born neurons along the longitudinal axis of the dentate gyrus wherein new neurons in the dorsal dentate gyrus are required for timely acquisition of contextual discrimination while immature neurons in the ventral dentate gyrus are necessary for anxiolytic/antidepressant-related effects of fluoxetine. Interestingly, when contexts are presented with altered temporal cues, or fluoxetine is administered alongside chronic glucocorticoid treatment, this dissociation is abrogated such that adult-born neurons across the entire dorsoventral extent of the dentate gyrus appear to contribute to these behaviors. Our results suggest that individual subpopulations of adult-born hippocampal neurons may be sufficient to mediate distinct behaviors in certain conditions, but are required to act in concert in more challenging situations.",

        "Abstract": "Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is critically implicated in rodent models of stress and anxiety as well as behavioral effects of antidepressants. Whereas similar factors such as psychiatric disorder and antidepressant administration are correlated with hippocampal volume in humans, the relationship between these factors and adult neurogenesis is less well understood. To better bridge the gap between rodent and human physiology, we examined the numbers of proliferating neural precursors and immature cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) as well as in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-estimated whole hippocampal volume in eight socially dominant- or subordinate-like (SL) baboons administered the antidepressant fluoxetine or vehicle. SL baboons had lower numbers of proliferating cells and immature neurons than socially dominant-like baboons. Fluoxetine treatment was associated with a larger whole hippocampal volume but surprisingly resulted in lower numbers of immature neurons. These findings are the first to indicate that adult neurogenesis in the baboon hippocampal DG may be functionally relevant in the context of social stress and mechanisms of antidepressant action.",

        "Title": "Adult neurogenesis modifies excitability of the dentate gyrus.",
        "Abstract": "Adult-born dentate granule neurons contribute to memory encoding functions of the dentate gyrus (DG) such as pattern separation. However, local circuit-mechanisms by which adult-born neurons partake in this process are poorly understood. Computational, neuroanatomical and electrophysiological studies suggest that sparseness of activation in the granule cell layer (GCL) is conducive for pattern separation. A sparse coding scheme is thought to facilitate the distribution of similar entorhinal inputs across the GCL to decorrelate overlapping representations and minimize interference. Here we used fast voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging combined with laser photostimulation and electrical stimulation to examine how selectively increasing adult DG neurogenesis influences local circuit activity and excitability. We show that DG of mice with more adult-born neurons exhibits decreased strength of neuronal activation and more restricted excitation spread in GCL while maintaining effective output to CA3c. Conversely, blockade of adult hippocampal neurogenesis changed excitability of the DG in the opposite direction. Analysis of GABAergic inhibition onto mature dentate granule neurons in the DG of mice with more adult-born neurons shows a modest readjustment of perisomatic inhibitory synaptic gain without changes in overall inhibitory tone, presynaptic properties or GABAergic innervation pattern. Retroviral labeling of connectivity in mice with more adult-born neurons showed increased number of excitatory synaptic contacts of adult-born neurons onto hilar interneurons. Together, these studies demonstrate that adult hippocampal neurogenesis modifies excitability of mature dentate granule neurons and that this non-cell autonomous effect may be mediated by local circuit mechanisms such as excitatory drive onto hilar interneurons. Modulation of DG excitability by adult-born dentate granule neurons may enhance sparse coding in the GCL to influence pattern separation.",

        "Abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) display a delayed onset of action of several weeks. Past work in naive rats showed that 5-HT\u2084 receptor agonists had rapid effects on depression-related behaviors and on hippocampal neurogenesis. We decided to investigate whether 5-HT\u2084 receptor stimulation was necessary for the effects of SSRIs in a mouse model of anxiety/depression, and whether hippocampal neurogenesis contributed to these effects. Using the mouse corticosterone model of anxiety/depression, we assessed whether chronic treatment with a 5-HT\u2084 receptor agonist (RS67333, 1.5 mg/kg/day) had effects on anxiety- and depression-related behaviors, as well as on hippocampal neurogenesis in comparison with chronic fluoxetine treatment (18 mg/kg/day). Then, using our anxiety/depression model combined with ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis, we investigated whether neurogenesis was necessary for the behavioral effects of subchronic (7 days) or chronic (28 days) RS67333 treatment. We also assessed whether a 5-HT\u2084 receptor antagonist (GR125487, 1\u2009mg/kg/day) could prevent the behavioral and neurogenic effects of fluoxetine. Chronic treatment with RS67333, similar to fluoxetine, induced anxiolytic/antidepressant-like activity and stimulated adult hippocampal neurogenesis, specifically facilitating maturation of newborn neurons. However, unlike fluoxetine, anxiolytic effects of RS67333 were already present after 7 days and did not require hippocampal neurogenesis. Chronic treatment with GR125487 prevented both anxiolytic/antidepressant-like and neurogenic effects of fluoxetine, indicating that 5-HT\u2084 receptor activation is necessary for these effects of SSRIs. 5-HT\u2084 receptor stimulation could represent an innovative and rapid onset therapeutic approach to treat depression with comorbid anxiety.",

        "Abstract": "In the adult mammalian brain, newly generated neurons are continuously incorporated into two networks: interneurons born in the subventricular zone migrate to the olfactory bulb, whereas the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus integrates locally born principal neurons. That the rest of the mammalian brain loses significant neurogenic capacity after the perinatal period suggests that unique aspects of the structure and function of DG and olfactory bulb circuits allow them to benefit from the adult generation of neurons. In this review, we consider the distinctive features of the DG that may account for it being able to profit from this singular form of neural plasticity. Approaches to the problem of neurogenesis are grouped as \"bottom-up,\" where the phenotype of adult-born granule cells is contrasted to that of mature developmentally born granule cells, and \"top-down,\" where the impact of altering the amount of neurogenesis on behavior is examined. We end by considering the primary implications of these two approaches and future directions.",

        "Title": "A method for biomarker measurements in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from anxious and depressed mice: \u03b2-arrestin 1 protein levels in depression and treatment.",
        "Abstract": "A limited number of biomarkers in the central and peripheral systems which are known may be useful for diagnosing major depressive disorders and predicting the effectiveness of antidepressant (AD) treatments. Since 60% of depressed patients do not respond adequately to medication or are resistant to ADs, it is imperative to delineate more accurate biomarkers. Recent clinical studies suggest that \u03b2-arrestin 1 levels in human mononuclear leukocytes may be an efficient biomarker. If potential biomarkers such as \u03b2-arrestin 1 could be assessed from a source such as peripheral blood cells, then they could be easily monitored and used to predict therapeutic responses. However, no previous studies have measured \u03b2-arrestin 1 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in anxious/depressive rodents. This study aimed to develop a method to detect \u03b2-arrestin protein levels through immunoblot analyses of mouse PBMCs isolated from whole blood. In order to validate the approach, \u03b2-arrestin levels were then compared in na\\\"{\\i}ve, anxious/depressed mice, and anxious/depressed mice treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (fluoxetine, 18~mg/kg/day in the drinking water). The results demonstrated that mouse whole blood collected by submandibular bleeding permitted isolation of enough PBMCs to assess circulating proteins such as \u03b2-arrestin 1. \u03b2-Arrestin 1 levels were successfully measured in healthy human subject and na\\\"{\\i}ve mouse PBMCs. Interestingly, PBMCs from anxious/depressed mice showed significantly reduced \u03b2-arrestin 1 levels. These decreased \u03b2-arrestin 1 expression levels were restored to normal levels with chronic fluoxetine treatment. The results suggest that isolation of PBMCs from mice by submandibular bleeding is a useful technique to screen putative biomarkers of the pathophysiology of mood disorders and the response to ADs. In addition, these results confirm that \u03b2-arrestin 1 is a potential biomarker for depression.",

        "Title": "Developmental effects of serotonin 1A autoreceptors on anxiety and social behavior.",
        "Abstract": "The serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1A) has a major role in modulating the effects of serotonin on mood and behavior. Previous studies have shown that knockout of 5-HT1A selectively in the raphe leads to higher levels of anxiety during adulthood. However, it remains unclear whether this phenotype is due to variation in receptor levels specifically during development or throughout life. To test the hypothesis that developmental sensitivity may underlie the effects of 5-HT1A on anxiety, we used an inducible transgenic system to selectively suppress 5-HT1A levels in serotonergic raphe neurons from post-natal days (P) 14 to P30, with a maximal reduction of 40% at P21 and return to regular levels by P30. This developmental decrease in receptor levels has long-lasting consequences, increasing anxiety and decreasing social investigation in adulthood. In addition, post-natal knockdown of autoreceptors leads to long-term increases in the excitability of serotonergic neurons, which may represent a mechanism underlying the effects of post-natal receptor variation on behavior later in life. Finally, we also examined the interplay between receptor variation and juvenile exposure to stress (applied from P14 to P21). Similar to receptor knockdown, juvenile exposure to stress led to increased anxiety phenotypes but did not exacerbate 5-HT1A knockdown-mediated anxiety levels. This work indicates that the effects of 5-HT1A autoreceptors on anxiety and social behaviors are developmentally mediated and suggests that natural variations in the expression of 5-HT1A may act during development to influence individual anxiety levels and contribute to susceptibility to anxiety disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Although cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit dysregulation is correlated with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), causation cannot be tested in humans. We used optogenetics in mice to simulate CSTC hyperactivation observed in OCD patients. Whereas acute orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-ventromedial striatum (VMS) stimulation did not produce repetitive behaviors, repeated hyperactivation over multiple days generated a progressive increase in grooming, a mouse behavior related to OCD. Increased grooming persisted for 2 weeks after stimulation cessation. The grooming increase was temporally coupled with a progressive increase in light-evoked firing of postsynaptic VMS cells. Both increased grooming and evoked firing were reversed by chronic fluoxetine, a first-line OCD treatment. Brief but repeated episodes of abnormal circuit activity may thus set the stage for the development of persistent psychopathology.",

        "Title": "Antidepressant and anxiolytic potential of the multimodal antidepressant vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) assessed by behavioural and neurogenesis outcomes in mice.",
        "Abstract": "Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is an investigational novel antidepressant with multimodal activity that functions as a 5-HT3, 5-HT7 and 5-HT(1D) receptor antagonist, 5-HT(1B) receptor partial agonist, 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist and inhibitor of the 5-HT transporter in vitro. Here we explore its anxiolytic and antidepressant potential in adult mice. Vortioxetine was assessed in BalB/cJ@RJ mice using the open-field and forced-swim tests (acute: p.o. 1 h, repeated: daily p.o. 21 days), and in 129S6/SvEvTac mice using the novelty suppressed feeding paradigm (acute: p.o. 1 h, sustained: daily p.o. 14 or 21 days). Fluoxetine and diazepam were controls. Acute and repeated dosing of vortioxetine produced more pronounced anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like activities than fluoxetine. Vortioxetine significantly increased cell proliferation and cell survival and stimulated maturation of immature granule cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus after 21 days of treatment. After 14 days, a high dose of vortioxetine increased dendritic length and the number of dendrite intersections, suggesting that vortioxetine accelerates the maturation of immature neurons. Vortioxetine displays an antidepressant and anxiolytic profile following repeated administration associated with increased neurogenesis at several stages. Vortioxetine effects were observed at low levels of 5-HT transporter occupancy, suggesting an alternative mechanism of action to 5-HT reuptake inhibition.",

        "Abstract": "The maintained expression of transcription factors throughout the development of mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mDA) neurons suggests multiple roles at various stages in development. Two members of the forkhead/winged helix transcription factor family, Foxa1 and Foxa2, have been recently shown to have an important influence in the early development of mDA neurons. Here we present data demonstrating that these genes are also involved in the later maintenance of the mDA system. We conditionally removed both genes in postmitotic mDA neurons using the dopamine transporter-cre mouse. Deletion of both Foxa1 and Foxa2 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive mDA neurons. The decrease was predominantly observed in the substantia nigra region of the mDA system, which led to a loss of TH+ fibers innervating the striatum. Further analysis demonstrated that the reduction in the number of TH+ cells in the mutant mice was not due to apoptosis or cell-fate change. Using reporter mouse lines, we found that the mDA neurons were still present in the ventral midbrain, but that they had lost much of their dopaminergic phenotype. The majority of these neurons remained in the ventral mesencephalon until at least 18 months of age. Chromatin immunoprecipitation suggested that the loss of the mDA phenotype is due to a reduction in the binding of the nuclear orphan receptor, Nurr-1 to the promoter region of TH. These results extend previous findings and demonstrate a later role for Foxa genes in regulating the maintenance of dopaminergic phenotype in mDA neurons.",

Here, we show that, dependent on their position along the\u00a0dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus, DG granule cells (GCs) control specific features of anxiety and contextual learning. Using optogenetic techniques to either elevate or decrease GC activity, we demonstrate that GCs in the dorsal DG control exploratory drive and encoding, not retrieval, of contextual fear memories. In contrast, elevating the\u00a0activity of GCs in the ventral DG has no effect on contextual learning but powerfully suppresses innate anxiety. These results suggest that strategies aimed at modulating the excitability of the ventral DG\u00a0may be beneficial for the treatment of anxiety disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) is an ancient signaling molecule that has a conserved role in modulating mood and behavior. Integral to its pleiotropic actions is the existence of multiple receptors, expressed in distinct but often overlapping patterns within the brain and the periphery. The existence of \u223c14 mammalian receptor subtypes, many of which possess similar pharmacological profiles, has made assigning functional roles for these receptors challenging. This challenge has been further compounded by the revelation that a single receptor can have several different functions depending upon where and when it is expressed and activated, that is, in brain versus periphery, or at different developmental time points. This review highlights the contribution of genetic techniques to dissect the specific function of distinct serotonin receptor populations across the life course, with an emphasis on the contribution of different serotonin 1A receptor populations to mood and behavior. Similar approaches hold the promise to elucidate the functional roles of other receptors, as well as the interaction of serotonin with other neuroendocrine modulators of mood and behavior.",

        "Abstract": "Antidepressant treatments enhance plasticity and increase neurogenesis in the adult brain, but it has been unclear how these effects influence mood. We propose that, like environmental enrichment and exercise, antidepressant treatments enhance adaptability by increasing structural variability within the nervous system at many levels, from proliferating precursors to immature synaptic contacts. Conversely, sensory deprivation and chronic stress reduce this structural variability. Activity-dependent competition within the mood-related circuits, guided by rehabilitation, then selects for the survival and stabilization of those structures that best represent the internal or external milieu. Increased variability together with competition-mediated selection facilitates normal function, such as pattern separation within the dentate gyrus and other mood-related circuits, thereby enhancing adaptability toward novel experiences.",

        "Abstract": "Smaller hippocampal volume is reported in major depressive disorder (MDD). We hypothesize that it may be related to fewer granule neurons (GN) in the dentate gyrus (DG), a defect possibly reversible with antidepressants. We studied age-, sex-, and postmortem interval-matched groups: no major psychopathology (controls); unmedicated-MDD; and MDD treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (MDD*SSRI) or tricyclics (MDD*TCA). Frozen right hippocampi were fixed, sectioned (50\u2009\u03bcm), immunostained with neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN), and counterstained with hematoxylin. GN and glial number, and DG and granule cell layer (GCL) volumes were stereologically estimated. Fewer GNs in the anterior DG were present in unmedicated-MDDs compared with controls (p=0.013). Younger age of MDD onset correlated with fewer GNs (p=0.021). Unmedicated-MDDs had fewer mid-DG GNs than MDD*SSRIs (p=0.028) and controls (p=0.032). Anterior GCL glial number did not differ between groups. Anterior/mid GCL volume was smaller in unmedicated-MDDs vs controls (p=0.008) and larger in MDD*SSRIs vs unmedicated-MDDs (p<0.001), MDD*TCAs (p<0.001), and controls (p<0.001). Anterior GCL volume and GN number (r=0.594, p=0.001), and mid DG volume and GN number (r=0.398, p=0.044) were correlated. Anterior DG capillary density correlated with GN number (p=0.027), and with GCL (p=0.024) and DG (r=0.400, p=0.047) volumes. Posterior DG volume and GN number did not differ between groups. Fewer GNs in unmedicated-MDD without fewer neuronal progenitor cells, as previously reported, suggests a cell maturation or survival defect, perhaps related to MDD duration. This may contribute to a smaller hippocampus and is potentially reversed by SSRIs. Postmortem studies are correlative and animal studies are needed to test implied causal relationships.",

        "Abstract": "Although an influence of adult neurogenesis in mediating some of the effects of antidepressants has received considerable attention in recent years, much less is known about how alterations in this form of plasticity may contribute to psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. One way to begin to address this question is to link the functions of adult-born hippocampal neurons with specific endophenotypes of these disorders. Recent studies have implicated adult-born hippocampal neurons in pattern separation, a process by which similar experiences or events are transformed into discrete, non-overlapping representations. Here we propose that impaired pattern separation underlies the overgeneralization often seen in anxiety disorders, specifically post-traumatic stress disorder and panic disorder, and therefore represents an endophenotype for these disorders. The development of new, pro-neurogenic compounds may therefore have therapeutic potential for patients who display pattern separation deficits.",

        "Abstract": "We used in vitro neurogenesis-based human neural stem cell (hNSCs) assays and rodent in vivo behavioral assays to identify potential novel antidepressants. A combination of buspirone and melatonin displayed antidepressant activity in these assays whereas neither buspirone nor melatonin alone showed any antidepressant-like profile. After evaluating numerous combination ratios, we determined that low dose buspirone 15 mg combined with melatonin-SR 3 mg yielded optimal antidepressant efficacy in our pre-clinical platform. The low dose of buspirone suggested that antidepressant efficacy might be achieved with only minimal adverse event liability. Based on these data, we conducted an exploratory 6-week, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and comparator-controlled study of the combination of buspirone and melatonin in subjects with acute Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The combination treatment revealed a significant antidepressant response in subjects with MDD on several measures (Clinical Global Impression of Severity and Improvement, Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology) compared to either placebo or buspirone 15 mg monotherapy. These preliminary findings have clinical implications and suggest that a platform of pre-clinical neurogenesis matched with confirmatory behavioral assays may be useful as a drug discovery strategy.",

A number of rare mutations are associated with autism, and it is unclear whether these result in common neuronal alterations. Monogenic syndromes, such as fragile X, include autism as one of their multifaceted symptoms and have revealed specific defects in synaptic plasticity. We discovered an unexpected convergence of synaptic pathophysiology in a nonsyndromic form of autism with those in fragile X syndrome. Neuroligin-3 knockout mice (a model for nonsyndromic autism) exhibited disrupted heterosynaptic competition and perturbed metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity, a hallmark of fragile X. These phenotypes could be rescued by reexpression of neuroligin-3 in juvenile mice, highlighting the possibility of reverting neuronal circuit alterations in autism after the completion of development.",

        "Abstract": "Serotonin is a critical regulator of bone mass, fulfilling different functions depending on its site of synthesis. Brain-derived serotonin promotes osteoblast proliferation, whereas duodenal-derived serotonin suppresses it. To understand the molecular mechanisms of duodenal-derived serotonin action on osteoblasts, we explored its transcriptional mediation in mice. We found that the transcription factor FOXO1 is a crucial determinant of the effects of duodenum-derived serotonin on bone formation We identified two key FOXO1 complexes in osteoblasts, one with the transcription factor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB) and another with activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Under normal levels of circulating serotonin, the proliferative activity of FOXO1 was promoted by a balance between its interaction with CREB and ATF4. However, high circulating serotonin levels prevented the association of FOXO1 with CREB, resulting in suppressed osteoblast proliferation. These observations identify FOXO1 as the molecular node of an intricate transcriptional machinery that confers the signal of duodenal-derived serotonin to inhibit bone formation.",

        "Abstract": "The 5-hydroxytryptamine type 4 receptor (5-HT(4)R) regulates many physiological processes, including learning and memory, cognition, and gastrointestinal motility. Little is known about its role in angiogenesis. Using mouse hindlimb ischemia model of angiogenesis, we observed a significant reduction of limb blood flow recovery 14 days after ischemia and a decrease in density of CD31-positive vessels in adductor muscles in 5-HT(4)R(-/-) mice compared to wild type littermates. Our in vitro data indicated that 5-HT(4)R endogenously expressed in endothelial cells (ECs) may promote angiogenesis. Inhibition of the receptor with 5-HT(4)R antagonist RS 39604 reduced EC capillary tube formation in the reconstituted basement membrane. Using Boyden chamber migration assay and wound healing \"scratch\" assay, we demonstrated that RS 39604 treatment significantly suppressed EC migration. Transendothelial resistance measurement and immunofluorescence analysis showed that a 5-HT(4)R agonist RS 67333 led to an increase in endothelial permeability, actin stress fiber and interendothelial gap formation. Importantly, we provided the evidence that 5-HT(4)R-regulated EC migration may be mediated by G\u03b113 and RhoA. Our results suggest a prominent role of 5-HT(4)R in promoting angiogenesis and identify 5-HT(4)R as a potential therapeutic target for modulating angiogenesis under pathological conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Optogenetics has been enthusiastically pursued in recent neuroscience research, and the causal relationship between neural activity and behavior is becoming ever more accessible. Here, we established knockin-mediated enhanced gene expression by improved tetracycline-controlled gene induction (KENGE-tet) and succeeded in generating transgenic mice expressing a highly light-sensitive channelrhodopsin-2 mutant at levels sufficient to drive the activities of multiple cell types. This method requires two lines of mice: one that controls the pattern of expression and another that determines the protein to be produced. The generation of new lines of either type readily expands the repertoire to choose from. In addition to neurons, we were able to manipulate the activity of nonexcitable glial cells in vivo. This shows that our system is applicable not only to neuroscience but also to any biomedical study that requires understanding of how the activity of a selected population of cells propagates through the intricate organic systems.",

        "Abstract": "Using in situ hybridization, we describe, for the first time, the profiles of expression of serotonin receptors (Htr/5-HTR) along the dorsal-ventral axis of mouse hippocampus. cRNA probes for most Htrs, excluding Htr6, were used. All hippocampal subregions and the entorhinal cortex cells providing input into the hippocampus were examined. The study shows that some, but not all, Htrs are expressed in the cells of the hippocampal circuitry. At both the subfield and the cell type levels, a somewhat overlapping pattern is observed. Four serotonin receptors, Htr1a, Htr2a, Htr2c and Htr7, display an expression pattern that changes along the dorsal-ventral axis of the hippocampus. Given the proposed functional differentiation of the hippocampus along its long axis, with the dorsal pole more involved in cognitive functions and the ventral pole more involved in mood and anxiety, our results suggest that serotonin receptors enriched in the ventral pole probably contribute to mood- and anxiety-related behaviours.",

However, the functional contribution of this critical window of plasticity to hippocampal neurogenesis and behavior remains unknown. Here, we show that deletion of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors from adult-born GCs impairs a neurogenesis-dependent form of LTP in the DG and reduces dendritic complexity of adult-born GCs, but does not impact their survival. Mice in which the NR2B-containing NMDA receptor was deleted from adult-born GCs did not differ from controls in baseline anxiety-like behavior or discrimination of very different contexts, but were impaired in discrimination of highly similar contexts. These results indicate that NR2B-dependent plasticity of adult-born GCs is necessary for fine contextual discrimination and is consistent with their proposed role in pattern separation.",

        "Abstract": "Anxiety disorders are characterized by persistent fear in the absence of immediate threat and represent the most common psychiatric diseases, with an estimated 28% lifetime prevalence worldwide (Kessler et al., 2010). While symptoms of anxiety are typically evoked by sensory stimuli, it is unknown whether sensory deficits contribute to the development of anxiety disorders. Here we examine the effect of defined genetic mutations that compromise the function of the olfactory system on the development of anxiety-like behaviors in mice. We show that the functional inactivation of the main olfactory epithelium, but not the vomeronasal organ, causes elevated levels of anxiety. Anxiety-like behaviors are also observed in mice with a monoclonal nose, that are able to detect and discriminate odors but in which the patterns of odor-evoked neural activity are perturbed. In these mice, plasma corticosterone levels are elevated, suggesting that olfactory deficits can lead to chronic stress. These results demonstrate a central role for olfactory sensory cues in modulating anxiety in mice.",

        "Abstract": "The hippocampus is involved in segregating memories, an ability that utilizes the neural process of pattern separation and allows for cognitive flexibility. We evaluated a proposed role for adult hippocampal neurogenesis in cognitive flexibility using variants of the active place avoidance task and two independent methods of ablating adult-born neurons, focal X-irradiation of the hippocampus, and genetic ablation of glial fibrillary acidic protein positive neural progenitor cells, in mice. We found that ablation of adult neurogenesis did not impair the ability to learn the initial location of a shock zone. However, when conflict was introduced by switching the location of the shock zone to the opposite side of the room, irradiated and transgenic mice entered the new shock zone location significantly more than their respective controls. This impairment was associated with increased upregulation of the immediate early gene Arc in the dorsal dentate gyrus, suggesting a role for adult neurogenesis in modulating network excitability and/or synaptic plasticity. Additional experiments revealed that irradiated mice were also impaired in learning to avoid a rotating shock zone when it was added to an initially learned stationary shock zone, but were unimpaired in learning the identical simultaneous task variant if it was their initial experience with place avoidance. Impaired avoidance could not be attributed to a deficit in extinction or an inability to learn a new shock zone location in a different environment. Together these results demonstrate that adult neurogenesis contributes to cognitive flexibility when it requires changing a learned response to a stimulus-evoked memory.",

        "Abstract": "Within the olfactory system, information flow from the periphery onto output mitral cells (MCs) of the olfactory bulb (OB) has been thought to be mediated by direct synaptic inputs from olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Here, we performed patch-clamp measurements in rat and mouse OB slices to investigate mechanisms of OSN signaling onto MCs, including the assumption of a direct path, using electrical and optogenetic stimulation methods that selectively activated OSNs. We found that MCs are in fact not typically activated by direct OSN inputs and instead require a multistep, diffuse mechanism involving another glutamatergic cell type, the tufted cells. The preference for a multistep mechanism reflects the fact that signals arising from direct OSN inputs are drastically shunted by connexin 36-mediated gap junctions on MCs, but not tufted cells. An OB circuit with tufted cells intermediate between OSNs and MCs suggests that considerable processing of olfactory information occurs before its reaching MCs.",

To investigate how antidepressants influence the response of mood-related systems to behavioral experience, we used a fear-conditioning and extinction paradigm in mice. Combining extinction training with chronic fluoxetine, but neither treatment alone, induced an enduring loss of conditioned fear memory in adult animals. Fluoxetine treatment increased synaptic plasticity, converted the fear memory circuitry to a more immature state, and acted through local brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Fluoxetine-induced plasticity may allow fear erasure by extinction-guided remodeling of the memory circuitry. Thus, the pharmacological effects of antidepressants need to be combined with psychological rehabilitation to reorganize networks rendered more plastic by the drug treatment.",

        "Abstract": "To explore the role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in novelty processing, we assessed novel object recognition (NOR) in mice after neurogenesis was arrested using focal x-irradiation of the hippocampus, or a reversible, genetic method in which glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive neural progenitor cells are ablated with ganciclovir. Arresting neurogenesis did not alter general activity or object investigation during four exposures with two constant objects. However, when a novel object replaced a constant object, mice with neurogenesis arrested by either ablation method showed increased exploration of the novel object when compared with control mice. The increased novel object exploration did not manifest until 4-6 weeks after x-irradiation or 6 weeks following a genetic ablation, indicating that exploration of the novel object is increased specifically by the elimination of 4- to 6-week-old adult born neurons. The increased novel object exploration was also observed in older mice, which exhibited a marked reduction in neurogenesis relative to young mice. Mice with neurogenesis arrested by either ablation method were also impaired in one-trial contextual fear conditioning (CFC) at 6 weeks but not at 4 weeks following ablation, further supporting the idea that 4- to 6-week-old adult born neurons are necessary for specific forms of hippocampal-dependent learning, and suggesting that the NOR and CFC effects have a common underlying mechanism. These data suggest that the transient enhancement of plasticity observed in young adult-born neurons contributes to cognitive functions.",

        "Abstract": "Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in cognitive and emotional processes, as well as in response to antidepressant treatment. However, little is known about how the adult stem cell lineage contributes to hippocampal structure and function and how this process is modulated by the animal's experience. Here we perform an indelible lineage analysis and report that neural stem cells can produce expanding and persisting populations of not only neurons, but also stem cells in the adult hippocampus. Furthermore, the ratio of stem cells to neurons depends on experiences of the animal or the location of the stem cell. Surprisingly, social isolation facilitated accumulation of stem cells, but not neurons. These results show that neural stem cells accumulate in the adult hippocampus and that the stem cell-lineage relationship is under control of anatomic and experiential niches. Our findings suggest that, in the hippocampus, fate specification may act as a form of cellular plasticity for adapting to environmental changes.",

Nonhuman primate (NHP) studies may bridge important rodent findings to the clinical realm since NHP-depression shares significant homology with human depression and kinetics of primate neurogenesis differ from those in rodents. After demonstrating that antidepressants can stimulate neurogenesis in NHPs, our present study examines whether neurogenesis is required for antidepressant efficacy in NHPs. MATERIALS/METHODOLOGY: Adult female bonnets were randomized to three social pens (N\u200a=\u200a6 each). Pen-1 subjects were exposed to control-conditions for 15 weeks with half receiving the antidepressant fluoxetine and the rest receiving saline-placebo. Pen-2 subjects were exposed to 15 weeks of separation-stress with half receiving fluoxetine and half receiving placebo. Pen-3 subjects 2 weeks of irradiation (N\u200a=\u200a4) or sham-irradiation (N\u200a=\u200a2) and then exposed to 15 weeks of stress and fluoxetine. Dependent measures were weekly behavioral observations and postmortem neurogenesis levels.",

        "Abstract": "Identifying the factors contributing to the etiology of anxiety and depression is critical for the development of more efficacious therapies. Serotonin (5-HT) is intimately linked to both disorders. The inhibitory serotonin-1A (5-HT(1A)) receptor exists in two separate populations with distinct effects on serotonergic signaling: (1) an autoreceptor that limits 5-HT release throughout the brain and (2) a heteroreceptor that mediates inhibitory responses to released 5-HT. Traditional pharmacologic and transgenic strategies have not addressed the distinct roles of these two receptor populations. Here we use a recently developed genetic mouse system to independently manipulate 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor and heteroreceptor populations. We show that 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors act to affect anxiety-like behavior. In contrast, 5-HT(1A) heteroreceptors affect responses to forced swim stress, without effects on anxiety-like behavior. Together with our previously reported work, these results establish distinct roles for the two receptor populations, providing evidence that signaling through endogenous 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors is necessary and sufficient for the establishment of normal anxiety-like behavior.",

In a depression/anxiety-like mouse model in which the response of the HPA axis is blunted, we investigated whether agomelatine could reverse behavioural deficits related to depression/anxiety compared to the classical selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine. Adult mice were treated for 8 wk with either vehicle or corticosterone (35 \u03bcg/ml.d) via drinking water. During the final 4 wk, animals were treated with vehicle, agomelatine (10 or 40 mg/kg i.p.) or fluoxetine (18 mg/kg i.p.) and tested in several behavioural paradigms and also evaluated for home-cage activity. Our results showed that the depressive/anxiety-like phenotype induced by corticosterone treatment is reversed by either chronic agomelatine or fluoxetine treatment. Moreover, agomelatine increased the dark/light ratio of home-cage activity in vehicle-treated mice and reversed the alterations in this ratio induced by chronic corticosterone, suggesting a normalization of disturbed circadian rhythms. Finally, we investigated the effects of this new antidepressant on neurogenesis. Agomelatine reversed the decreased cell proliferation in the whole hippocampus in corticosterone-treated mice and increased maturation of newborn neurons in both vehicle- and corticosterone-treated mice. Overall, the present study suggests that agomelatine, with its distinct mechanism of action based on the synergy between the melatonergic agonist and 5-HT2C antagonist properties, provides a distinct antidepressant/anxiolytic spectrum including circadian rhythm normalization.",

        "Title": "Increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve pattern separation.",
        "Abstract": "Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a unique form of neural circuit plasticity that results in the generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus throughout life. Neurons that arise in adults (adult-born neurons) show heightened synaptic plasticity during their maturation and can account for up to ten per cent of the entire granule cell population. Moreover, levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis are increased by interventions that are associated with beneficial effects on cognition and mood, such as learning, environmental enrichment, exercise and chronic treatment with antidepressants. Together, these properties of adult neurogenesis indicate that this process could be harnessed to improve hippocampal functions. However, despite a substantial number of studies demonstrating that adult-born neurons are necessary for mediating specific cognitive functions, as well as some of the behavioural effects of antidepressants, it is unknown whether an increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve cognition and mood. Here we show that inducible genetic expansion of the population of adult-born neurons through enhancing their survival improves performance in a specific cognitive task in which two similar contexts need to be distinguished. Mice with increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis show normal object recognition, spatial learning, contextual fear conditioning and extinction learning but are more efficient in differentiating between overlapping contextual representations, which is indicative of enhanced pattern separation. Furthermore, stimulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, when combined with an intervention such as voluntary exercise, produces a robust increase in exploratory behaviour. However, increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis alone does not produce a behavioural response like that induced by anxiolytic agents or antidepressants. Together, our findings suggest that strategies that are designed to increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis specifically, by targeting the cell death of adult-born neurons or by other mechanisms, may have therapeutic potential for reversing impairments in pattern separation and dentate gyrus dysfunction such as those seen during normal ageing.",

        "Abstract": "The neurogenesis hypothesis of depression was originally formed upon the demonstration that stress impacts levels of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Since then much work has established that newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus are required for mediating some of the beneficial effects of antidepressant treatment. Recent studies combining behavioral, molecular and electrophysiological approaches have attempted to make sense of the role young neurons play in modulating mood by demonstrating a potential role in regulating the circuitry in the brain that underlies depression. Here we discuss the work that led to the neurogenesis hypothesis of depression, and the subsequent studies that have sought to test this hypothesis. We also discuss different animal models of depression that have been used to test the role of neurogenesis in mediating the antidepressant response.",

        "Title": "Autism and increased paternal age related changes in global levels of gene expression regulation.",
        "Abstract": "A causal role of mutations in multiple general transcription factors in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism suggested that alterations in global levels of gene expression regulation might also relate to disease risk in sporadic cases of autism. This premise can be tested by evaluating for changes in the overall distribution of gene expression levels. For instance, in mice, variability in hippocampal-dependent behaviors was associated with variability in the pattern of the overall distribution of gene expression levels, as assessed by variance in the distribution of gene expression levels in the hippocampus. We hypothesized that a similar change in variance might be found in children with autism. Gene expression microarrays covering greater than 47,000 unique RNA transcripts were done on RNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of children with autism (n\u200a=\u200a82) and controls (n\u200a=\u200a64). Variance in the distribution of gene expression levels from each microarray was compared between groups of children. Also tested was whether a risk factor for autism, increased paternal age, was associated with variance. A decrease in the variance in the distribution of gene expression levels in PBL was associated with the diagnosis of autism and a risk factor for autism, increased paternal age. Traditional approaches to microarray analysis of gene expression suggested a possible mechanism for decreased variance in gene expression. Gene expression pathways involved in transcriptional regulation were down-regulated in the blood of children with autism and children of older fathers. Thus, results from global and gene specific approaches to studying microarray data were complimentary and supported the hypothesis that alterations at the global level of gene expression regulation are related to autism and increased paternal age. Global regulation of transcription, thus, represents a possible point of convergence for multiple etiologies of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Depression is a polygenic and highly complex psychiatric disorder that is currently a major burden on society. Depression is highly heterogeneous in presentation and frequently exhibits high comorbidity with other psychiatric and somatic disorders. Commonly used treatments, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are not ideal since only a subset of patients achieve remission. In addition, the reason why some individuals respond to SSRIs while others don't are unknown. Here we begin to ask what the basis of treatment resistance is, and propose new strategies to model this phenomenon in animals. We focus specifically on animal models that offer the appropriate framework to study treatment resistance with face, construct and predictive validity.",

        "Abstract": "Selective serotonin (5-HT) re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in Humans. However, because only few animal models display overt anxious-like behavior, detailed preclinical studies of the anxiolytic properties of antidepressants are still lacking. Here, we studied the neurochemical and behavioral effects of a double 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor knockout in mice (5-HT(1A/1B)-/-) as compared to their wild-type littermates (5-HT(1A/1B)+/+). It is known that single deletion of either 5-HT(1A) or 5-HT(1B) receptor induces behavioral changes that are not correlated with differences in brain serotonergic tone. Deletion of both receptors resulted in (i) higher emotionality of animals, as observed in three unconditioned paradigms of anxiety (open field, elevated plus maze and novelty suppressed feeding tests); (ii) a \u2248200% increase in the mean spontaneous firing rate of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) compared to 5-HT(1A/1B)+/+ mice; (iii) elevated basal dialysate levels of 5-HT in the DRN and frontal cortex; (iv) an exaggerated response to acute paroxetine administration in microdialysis experiments, and (v) increased basal core body temperature. These findings suggest that the deletion of both autoreceptors induces a strong anxious-like behavioral state associated with increased 5-HT neurotransmission. Interestingly, 5-HT(1A/1B)-/- mice are still sensitive to the acute administration of diazepam. Moreover, while deletion of both receptors impacted on the response to acute SSRI treatment in the forced swim test, anxiolytic-like effects of a chronic SSRI treatment were still observed in 5-HT(1A/1B)-/- mice. Thus, the 5-HT(1A/1B)-/- mouse model could be of great interest to unveil the mechanisms of action of the anxiolytic effects of SSRIs.",

        "Abstract": "In the adult mammalian brain, neurogenesis originates from astrocyte-like stem cells. We generated a transgenic mouse line in which the tetracycline dependent transactivator (tTA) is expressed under the control of the murine GFAP promoter. In this mouse line, inducible gene expression targets virtually all GFAP-expressing stem-like cells in the dentate gyrus and a subset of GFAP-expressing progenitors located primarily in the dorsal wall/dorsolateral corner of the subventricular zone. Outside the neurogenic zones, astrocytes are infrequently targeted. We introduce a panel of transgenic mice which allow both inducible expression of candidate genes under control of the murine GFAP promoter and, at the same time, lineage tracing of all cells descendant from the original GFAP-positive cell. This new mouse line represents a versatile tool for functional analysis of neurogenesis and lineage tracing.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine system disorders ranging from movement disorders to addiction and schizophrenia involve striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), yet their functional connectivity has been difficult to determine comprehensively. We generated a mouse with conditional channelrhodopsin-2 expression restricted to medium spiny neurons and assessed the specificity and strength of their intrinsic connections in the striatum and their projections to the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra. In the striatum, medium spiny neurons connected with other MSNs and tonically active cholinergic interneurons, but not with fast-spiking GABA interneurons. In the globus pallidus, medium spiny neurons connected strongly with one class of electrophysiologically identified neurons, but weakly with the other. In the substantia nigra, medium spiny neurons connected strongly with GABA, but not with dopamine neurons. Projections to the globus pallidus showed solely D2-mediated presynaptic inhibition, whereas projections to the substantia nigra showed solely D1-mediated presynaptic facilitation. This optogenetic approach defines the functional connectome of the striatal medium spiny neuron.",

        "Abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that leptin regulates appetite and energy expenditure, at least in part by inhibiting serotonin synthesis and release from brainstem neurons. To demonstrate that this pathway works postnatally, we used a conditional, brainstem-specific mouse CreER(T2) driver to show that leptin signals in brainstem neurons after birth to decrease appetite by inhibiting serotonin synthesis. Cell-specific gene deletion experiments and intracerebroventricular leptin infusions reveal that serotonin signals in arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus through the Htr1a receptor to favor food intake and that this serotonin function requires the expression of Creb, which regulates the expression of several genes affecting appetite. Accordingly, a specific antagonist of the Htr1a receptor decreases food intake in leptin-deficient but not in Htr1a(-/-) mice. Collectively, these results establish that leptin inhibition of serotonin is necessary to inhibit appetite postnatally and provide a proof of principle that selective inhibition of this pathway may be a viable option to treat appetite disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus has gained considerable attention as a cellular substrate for both the pathophysiology and treatment of depression. Overall, the studies of adult hippocampal neurogenesis are still in their infancy because most of them explore only one stage of this process. Importantly, given the built-in homeostatic mechanisms that act at each stage during the progression from stem cells to mature neurons (proliferation, differentiation, maturation, survival), it is very difficult to extrapolate the efficiency of a drug on adult neurogenesis from analysis of one stage alone. Here, we review the most significant data on hippocampal neurogenesis, focusing on the importance of studying each stage of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and also on the importance of choosing the appropriate mouse strain to perform the experiment. Specifically, strains with a high number of basal proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus should be used only under stressed conditions to detect the effects of antidepressants on adult neurogenesis. We also discuss how adult hippocampal neurogenesis could be involved in affective state disorders such as depression and anxiety. Finally, we reveal that the behavioral effects of fluoxetine are mediated through both neurogenesis-dependent and -independent actions.",

        "Title": "Effects of adult-generated granule cells on coordinated network activity in the dentate gyrus.",
        "Abstract": "Throughout the adult life of most mammals, new neurons are continuously generated in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Recent work has documented specific cognitive deficits after elimination of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents, suggesting that these neurons may contribute to information processing in hippocampal circuits. Young adult-born neurons exhibit enhanced excitability and have altered capacity for synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slice preparations in vitro. Still, little is known about the effect of adult-born granule cells on hippocampal activity in vivo. To assess the impact of these new neurons on neural circuits in the dentate, we recorded perforant-path evoked responses and spontaneous network activity from the dentate gyrus of urethane-anesthetized mice whose hippocampus had been focally X-irradiated to eliminate the population of young adult-born granule cells. After X-irradiation, perforant-path responses were reduced in magnitude. In contrast, there was a marked increase in the amplitude of spontaneous \u03b3-frequency bursts in the dentate gyrus and hilus, as well as increased synchronization of dentate neuron firing to these bursts. A similar increase in gamma burst amplitude was also found in animals in which adult neurogenesis was eliminated using the GFAP:TK pharmacogenetic ablation technique. These data suggest that young neurons may inhibit or destabilize recurrent network activity in the dentate and hilus. This unexpected result yields a new perspective on how a modest number of young adult-generated granule cells may modulate activity in the larger population of mature granule cells, rather than acting solely as independent encoding units.",

        "Abstract": "The role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in contextual fear conditioning (CFC) is debated. Several studies demonstrated that blocking adult hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents impairs CFC, while several other studies failed to observe an impairment. We sought to determine whether different CFC methods vary in their sensitivity to the arrest of adult neurogenesis. Adult neurogenesis was arrested in mice using low-dose, targeted x-irradiation, and the effects of irradiation were assayed in conditioning procedures that varied in the use of a discrete conditioned stimulus, the number of trials administered, and the final level of conditioning produced. We demonstrate that irradiation impairs CFC in mice when a single-trial CFC procedure is used but not when multiple-trial procedures are used, regardless of the final level of contextual fear produced. In addition, we show that the irradiation-induced deficit in single-trial CFC can be rescued by providing preexposure to the conditioning context. These results indicate that adult hippocampal neurogenesis is required for CFC in mice only when brief training is provided.",

        "Abstract": "Patients suffering from dementia of Alzheimer's type express less serotonin 4 receptors (5-HTR(4)), but whether an absence of these receptors modifies learning and memory is unexplored. In the spatial version of the Morris water maze, we show that 5-HTR(4) knock-out (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice performed similarly for spatial learning, short- and long-term retention. Since 5-HTR(4) control mnesic abilities, we tested whether cholinergic system had circumvented the absence of 5-HTR(4). Inactivating muscarinic receptor with scopolamine, at an ineffective dose (0.8 mg/kg) to alter memory in WT mice, decreased long-term but not short-term memory of 5-HTR(4) KO mice. Other changes included decreases in the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the required enzyme for acetylcholine synthesis, in the septum and the dorsal hippocampus in 5-HTR(4) KO under baseline conditions. Training- and scopolamine-induced increase and decrease, respectively in ChAT activity in the septum in WT mice were not detected in the 5-HTR(4) KO animals. Findings suggest that adaptive changes in cholinergic systems may circumvent the absence of 5-HTR(4) to maintain long-term memory under baseline conditions. In contrast, despite adaptive mechanisms, the absence of 5-HTR(4) aggravates scopolamine-induced memory impairments. The mechanisms whereby 5-HTR(4) mediate a tonic influence on ChAT activity and muscarinic receptors remain to be determined.",

        "Abstract": "We created the Flexible Accelerated STOP Tetracycline Operator (tetO)-knockin (FAST) system, an efficient method for manipulating gene expression in vivo to rapidly screen animal models of disease. A single gene targeting event yields two distinct knockin mice-STOP-tetO and tetO knockin-that permit generation of multiple strains with variable expression patterns: 1) knockout, 2) Cre-mediated rescue, 3) tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activator (tTA)-mediated misexpression, 4) tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activator (tTA)-mediated overexpression, and 5) tetracycline-controlled transcriptional silencer (tTS)-mediated conditional knockout/knockdown. Using the FAST system, multiple gain-of-function and loss-of-function strains can therefore be generated on a time scale not previously achievable. These strains can then be screened for clinically relevant abnormalities. We demonstrate the flexibility and broad applicability of the FAST system by targeting several genes encoding proteins implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders: Mlc1, neuroligin 3, the serotonin 1A receptor, and the serotonin 1B receptor.",

        "Abstract": "Most depressed patients don't respond to their first drug treatment, and the reasons for this treatment resistance remain enigmatic. Human studies implicate a polymorphism in the promoter of the serotonin-1A (5-HT(1A)) receptor gene in increased susceptibility to depression and decreased treatment response. Here we develop a new strategy to manipulate 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors in raphe nuclei without affecting 5-HT(1A) heteroreceptors, generating mice with higher (1A-High) or lower (1A-Low) autoreceptor levels. We show that this robustly affects raphe firing rates, but has no effect on either basal forebrain serotonin levels or conflict-anxiety measures. However, compared to 1A-Low mice, 1A-High mice show a blunted physiological response to acute stress, increased behavioral despair, and no behavioral response to antidepressant, modeling patients with the 5-HT(1A) risk allele. Furthermore, reducing 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor levels prior to antidepressant treatment is sufficient to convert nonresponders into responders. These results establish a causal relationship between 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor levels, resilience under stress, and response to antidepressants.",

        "Abstract": "Leptin inhibition of bone mass accrual requires the integrity of specific hypothalamic neurons but not expression of its receptor on these neurons. The same is true for its regulation of appetite and energy expenditure. This suggests that leptin acts elsewhere in the brain to achieve these three functions. We show here that brainstem-derived serotonin (BDS) favors bone mass accrual following its binding to Htr2c receptors on ventromedial hypothalamic neurons and appetite via Htr1a and 2b receptors on arcuate neurons. Leptin inhibits these functions and increases energy expenditure because it reduces serotonin synthesis and firing of serotonergic neurons. Accordingly, while abrogating BDS synthesis corrects the bone, appetite and energy expenditure phenotypes caused by leptin deficiency, inactivation of the leptin receptor in serotonergic neurons recapitulates them fully. This study modifies the map of leptin signaling in the brain and identifies a molecular basis for the common regulation of bone and energy metabolisms.

        "Abstract": "The dentate gyrus (DG) is modified throughout life by integration of new adult-born neurons. Similarities in neuronal maturation during DG development and adult hippocampal neurogenesis suggest that genetically encoded intrinsic regulatory mechanisms underlying these temporally distinct processes are conserved and reused. Here, we identify a novel transcriptional regulator of dentate granule neuron maturation, Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 9 (Klf-9). We show that Klf-9 expression is induced by neuronal activity and as dentate granule neurons functionally integrate in the developing and adult DG. During development, dentate granule neurons lacking Klf-9 show delayed maturation as reflected by altered expression of early-phase markers, dendritic spine formation, and electrophysiological properties. Adult Klf-9-null mice exhibit normal stem cell proliferation and cell fate specification in the DG but show impaired differentiation of adult-born neurons and decreased neurogenesis-dependent synaptic plasticity. Behavioral analysis of Klf-9-null mice revealed a subtle increase in anxiety-like behavior and an impairment in contextual fear discrimination learning. Thus, Klf-9 is necessary for late-phase maturation of dentate granule neurons both in DG development and during adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Klf-9-dependent neuronal maturation may therefore represent a candidate regulatory mechanism underlying these temporally distinct processes.",

        "Abstract": "Although the mature enteric nervous system (ENS) has been shown to retain stem cells, enteric neurogenesis has not previously been demonstrated in adults. The relative number of enteric neurons in wild-type (WT) mice and those lacking 5-HT(4) receptors [knock-out (KO)] was found to be similar at birth; however, the abundance of ENS neurons increased during the first 4 months after birth in WT but not KO littermates. Enteric neurons subsequently decreased in both WT and KO but at 12 months were significantly more numerous in WT. We tested the hypothesis that stimulation of the 5-HT(4) receptor promotes enteric neuron survival and/or neurogenesis. In vitro, 5-HT(4) agonists increased enteric neuronal development/survival, decreased apoptosis, and activated CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein). In vivo, in WT but not KO mice, 5-HT(4) agonists induced bromodeoxyuridine incorporation into cells that expressed markers of neurons (HuC/D, doublecortin), neural precursors (Sox10, nestin, Phox2b), or stem cells (Musashi-1). This is the first demonstration of adult enteric neurogenesis; our results suggest that 5-HT(4) receptors are required postnatally for ENS growth and maintenance.",

Whole frozen hippocampi from untreated subjects with MDD (N=5), antidepressant-treated MDD (MDDT, N=7), and controls (C, N=7) were fixed, sectioned, and immunostained for NPCs and dividing cell markers (nestin and Ki-67, respectively), NeuN and GFAP, in single and double labeling. NPC and dividing cell numbers in the DG were estimated by stereology. Clinical data were obtained by psychological autopsy, and by toxicological and neuropathological examination performed on all subjects. NPCs decreased with age (p = 0.034). Females had more NPCs than males (p = 0.023). Correcting for age and sex, MDDT receiving SSRIs had more NPCs than untreated MDD (p < or = 0.001) and controls (p < or = 0.001), NPCs were not different in SSRI- and TCA-treated MDDT (p = 0.169). Dividing cell number, unaffected by age or sex, was greater in MDDT receiving TCAs than in untreated MDD (p < or = 0.001), SSRI-treated MDD (p = 0.001), and controls (p < or = 0.001). The increase of NPCs and dividing cells in MDDT was localized to the rostral DG. MDDT had a larger DG volume compared with untreated MDD or controls (p = 0.009). Antidepressants increase NPC number in the anterior human DG. Whether this finding is critical or necessary for the antidepressants effect remains to be determined.",

        "Abstract": "This review examines the general hypothesis that cellular plasticity may be related to genomic plasticity. Using a novel approach to microarray analysis, recent studies from our laboratory showed that, in genetically identical mice, variability in the large-scale organization of gene expression was associated with individual differences in behavior. An association of the large-scale organization of gene expression in the hippocampus with behavioral variability suggests that an important aspect of gene expression regulation had gone unrecognized with traditional genomic approaches designed to look for specific differences in gene expression levels. Here we introduce the concept of a 'genomic tone' as a global genomic property related to the levels and balance between factors that generally promote and factors that generally inhibit gene expression. We suggest that genomic tone may be related to the plasticity of the gene expression system and may be an important target for developmental and therapeutic interventions.",

        "Abstract": "Dysregulated glutamatergic neurotransmission has been strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SCZ). Recently, presynaptic modulation of glutamate transmission has been shown to have therapeutic promise. We asked whether genetic knockdown of glutaminase (gene GLS1) to reduce glutamatergic transmission presynaptically by slowing the recycling of glutamine to glutamate, would produce a phenotype relevant to SCZ and its treatment. GLS1 heterozygous (GLS1 het) mice showed about a 50% global reduction in glutaminase activity, and a modest reduction in glutamate levels in brain regions relevant to SCZ pathophysiology, but displayed neither general behavioral abnormalities nor SCZ-associated phenotypes. Functional imaging, measuring regional cerebral blood volume, showed hippocampal hypometabolism mainly in the CA1 subregion and subiculum, the inverse of recent clinical imaging findings in prodromal and SCZ patients. GLS1 het mice were less sensitive to the behavioral stimulating effects of amphetamine, showed a reduction in amphetamine-induced striatal dopamine release and in ketamine-induced frontal cortical activation, suggesting that GLS1 het mice are resistant to the effects of these pro-psychotic challenges. Moreover, GLS1 het mice showed clozapine-like potentiation of latent inhibition, suggesting that reduction in glutaminase has antipsychotic-like properties. These observations provide further support for the pivotal role of altered glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the pathophysiology of SCZ, and suggest that presynaptic modulation of the glutamine-glutamate pathway through glutaminase inhibition may provide a new direction for the pharmacotherapy of SCZ.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding the physiopathology of affective disorders and their treatment relies on the availability of experimental models that accurately mimic aspects of the disease. Here we describe a mouse model of an anxiety/depressive-like state induced by chronic corticosterone treatment. Furthermore, chronic antidepressant treatment reversed the behavioral dysfunctions and the inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis induced by corticosterone treatment. In corticosterone-treated mice where hippocampal neurogenesis is abolished by X-irradiation, the efficacy of fluoxetine is blocked in some, but not all, behavioral paradigms, suggesting both neurogenesis-dependent and -independent mechanisms of antidepressant action. Finally, we identified a number of candidate genes, the expression of which is decreased by chronic corticosterone and normalized by chronic fluoxetine treatment selectively in the hypothalamus. Importantly, mice deficient in one of these genes, beta-arrestin 2, displayed a reduced response to fluoxetine in multiple tasks, suggesting that beta-arrestin signaling is necessary for the antidepressant effects of fluoxetine.",

        "Abstract": "Preclinical data support the view that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and serotonergic systems regulate circuits involved in affective disorders. The present study examined neurochemical and behavioural consequences of an acute intrahippocampal injection of BDNF combined with an antidepressant by using in-vivo intracerebral microdialysis in the ventral hippocampus (vHi) in conscious mice and behavioural paradigms predictive of antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effects [the mouse forced swim test (FST), the open-field (OF) paradigm and the elevated plus maze (EPM)]. Neurochemical data revealed that BDNF (100 ng) potentiated the effects of the systemic administration of a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; paroxetine 4 mg/kg i.p.) and that of a locally applied citalopram perfusion on dialysate 5-HT levels in the vHi. These neurochemical changes correlated with behavioural data since, in the FST, antidepressant-like activity of paroxetine as measured on swimming behaviour was potentiated by BDNF. These data suggest an interesting synergy between BDNF and SSRI on antidepressant-like activity. Furthermore, in both the OF and EPM paradigms BDNF induced an anxiogenic-like activity, whereas paroxetine prevented this effect. Finally, the neurochemical and behavioural effects of BDNF on the serotonergic system might occur at both pre- and post-synaptic levels since by using in-situ hybridization, we showed that TrkB-R mRNA was expressed in the hippocampus and the dorsal raphe nucleus in adult mice. Taken together the neurochemical and behavioural effects of BDNF suggest that these behavioural changes were mediated by increases in 5-HT neurotransmission in vHi. Thus a BDNF+SSRI combination may offer new alternatives to treat mood disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Loss- and gain-of-function mutations in the broadly expressed gene Lrp5 affect bone formation, causing osteoporosis and high bone mass, respectively. Although Lrp5 is viewed as a Wnt coreceptor, osteoblast-specific disruption of beta-Catenin does not affect bone formation. Instead, we show here that Lrp5 inhibits expression of Tph1, the rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme for serotonin in enterochromaffin cells of the duodenum. Accordingly, decreasing serotonin blood levels normalizes bone formation and bone mass in Lrp5-deficient mice, and gut- but not osteoblast-specific Lrp5 inactivation decreases bone formation in a beta-Catenin-independent manner. Moreover, gut-specific activation of Lrp5, or inactivation of Tph1, increases bone mass and prevents ovariectomy-induced bone loss. Serotonin acts on osteoblasts through the Htr1b receptor and CREB to inhibit their proliferation. By identifying duodenum-derived serotonin as a hormone inhibiting bone formation in an Lrp5-dependent manner, this study broadens our understanding of bone remodeling and suggests potential therapies to increase bone mass.",

        "Abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors take several weeks to produce their maximal therapeutic antidepressant effect. This delay has been attributed to the gradual desensitization of somatodendritic serotonin 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors. We evaluated adaptive changes of 5-HT(1A) receptors after acute and chronic citalopram challenges in rat. Small animal positron emission tomography trial and quantitative ex vivo autoradiography studies using [(18)F]MPPF were employed, as well as in vitro 8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding assay. Additionally, 5-HT(1A) receptor knock-out mice were used to assess the specificity of [(18)F]MPPF. Acute treatment with citalopram did not alter [(18)F]MPPF binding in dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), frontal cortex, or hippocampus. The absence of [(18)F]MPPF binding in the brain of 5-HT(1A) knock-out mice demonstrates the specificity of MPPF for 5-HT(1A) receptor brain imaging, but the high affinity of [(18)F]MPPF compared to 5-HT suggests that it would only be displaced by dramatic increases in extracellular 5-HT. Chronic citalopram did not modify 5-HT(1A) receptor density in any of the brain regions studied. In addition, this treatment did not modify 8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding in DR, although a significant increase was observed in frontal cortex and hippocampus. [(18)F]MPPF appears to be an efficient radioligand to quantify specifically 5-HT(1A) receptor density in brain imaging. The delayed therapeutic efficacy of citalopram did not appear to be linked to either a downregulation of 5-HT(1A) receptors or to a 5-HT(1A) receptor-G protein decoupling process in serotonergic neurons, but to increased functional sensitivity of postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors.",

        "Abstract": "Despite sharing the same genes, identical twins demonstrate substantial variability in behavioral traits and in their risk for disease. Epigenetic factors-DNA and chromatin modifications that affect levels of gene expression without affecting the DNA sequence-are thought to be important in establishing this variability. Epigenetically-mediated differences in the levels of gene expression that are associated with individual variability traditionally are thought to occur only in a gene-specific manner. We challenge this idea by exploring the large-scale organizational patterns of gene expression in an epigenetic model of behavioral variability.",

        "Abstract": "Various chronic antidepressant treatments increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis, but the functional importance of this phenomenon remains unclear. Using radiological and genetic methods, we show that disrupting neurogenesis blocks behavioural responses to antidepressants. X-irradiation of a restricted region of mouse brain containing the hippocampus prevented the neurogenic and behavioural effects of two classes of antidepressants. Similarly, a genetic strategy that ablates adult progenitor cells resulted in a lack of effect of antidepressants. In addition, we have identified a form of long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus that is dependent on the presence of young neurons and which is stimulated by antidepressants. These findings suggest that the behavioural effects of chronic antidepressants require hippocampal neurogenesis and are mediated by an increased synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic treatments with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to increase hippocampal neurogenesis. However, it is not known whether SSRIs impact the maturation and functional integration of newborn neurons. Here we examined the effects of subchronic and chronic fluoxetine on the structural and physiological properties of young granule cells. Our results show that doublecortin-positive immature neurons displayed increased dendritic arborization after chronic fluoxetine treatment. In addition, chronic but not subchronic fluoxetine elicited a decrease in the number of newborn neurons expressing immature markers and a corresponding increase in those expressing mature markers. These results suggest that chronic fluoxetine accelerates the maturation of immature neurons. We also investigated the effects of fluoxetine on a form of neurogenesis-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus. This form of LTP was enhanced by chronic fluoxetine, and ablation of neurogenesis with x-irradiation completely blocked the effects of chronic fluoxetine on LTP. Finally, we demonstrated that the behavioral effect of fluoxetine in the novelty-suppressed feeding test requires chronic administration and is blocked by x-irradiation. These results show that the effects of fluoxetine on LTP and behavior both require neurogenesis and follow a similar delayed time course. The effects of chronic fluoxetine on the maturation and functional properties of young neurons may therefore be necessary for its anxiolytic/antidepressant activity and contribute to its delayed onset of therapeutic efficacy.",

        "Title": "Anorexia induced by activation of serotonin 5-HT4 receptors is mediated by increases in CART in the nucleus accumbens.",
        "Abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is a growing concern in mental health, often inducing death. The potential neuronal deficits that may underlie abnormal inhibitions of food intake, however, remain largely unexplored. We hypothesized that anorexia may involve altered signaling events within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain structure involved in reward. We show here that direct stimulation of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) 4 receptors (5-HT(4)R) in the NAc reduces the physiological drive to eat and increases CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) mRNA levels in fed and food-deprived mice. It further shows that injecting 5-HT(4)R antagonist or siRNA-mediated 5-HT(4)R knockdown into the NAc induced hyperphagia only in fed mice. This hyperphagia was not associated with changes in CART mRNA expression in the NAc in fed and food-deprived mice. Results include that 5-HT(4)R control CART mRNA expression into the NAc via a cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. Considering that CART may interfere with food- and drug-related rewards, we tested whether the appetite suppressant properties of 3,4-N-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) involve the 5-HT(4)R. Using 5-HT(4)R knockout mice, we demonstrate that 5-HT(4)R are required for the anorectic effect of MDMA as well as for the MDMA-induced enhancement of CART mRNA expression in the NAc. Directly injecting CART peptide or CART siRNA into the NAc reduces or increases food consumption, respectively. Finally, stimulating 5-HT(4)R- and MDMA-induced anorexia were both reduced by injecting CART siRNA into the NAc. Collectively, these results demonstrate that 5-HT(4)R-mediated up-regulation of CART in the NAc triggers the appetite-suppressant effects of ecstasy.",

In the quest for elucidating the neurobiological basis of MDD, hippocampal neurogenesis has emerged as a candidate substrate, both for the etiology as well as treatment of MDD. This chapter critiques the advances made in the study of hippocampal neurogenesis as they relate to the neurogenic hypothesis of MDD. While an involvement of neurogenesis in the etiology of depression remains highly speculative, preclinical studies have revealed a novel and previously unrecognized role for hippocampal neurogenesis in mediating some of the behavioral effects of antidepressants.

        "Abstract": "The development of new treatments for depression is predicated upon identification of neural substrates and mechanisms that underlie its etiology and pathophysiology. The heterogeneity of depression indicates that its origin may lie in dysfunction of multiple brain regions. Here we evaluate adult hippocampal neurogenesis as a candidate mechanism for the etiology of depression and as a substrate for antidepressant action. Current evidence indicates that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may not be a major contributor to the development of depression, but may be required for some of the behavioral effects of antidepressants. We next revisit the functional differentiation of the hippocampus along the septo-temporal axis within the context of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and suggest that neurogenesis in the ventral dentate gyrus may be preferentially involved in regulation of emotion. Finally, we speculate on how increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis may modulate dentate gyrus function to confer the behavioral effects of antidepressants.",

        "Abstract": "Growing evidence supports the involvement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mood disorders and the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs. However, the relationship between BDNF and serotonergic signalling is poorly understood. Heterozygous mutants BDNF +/- mice were utilized to investigate the influence of BDNF on the serotonin (5-HT) system and the activity of the serotonin transporter (SERT) in the hippocampus. The zero net flux method of quantitative microdialysis revealed that BDNF +/- heterozygous mice have increased basal extracellular 5-HT levels in the hippocampus and decreased 5-HT reuptake capacity. In keeping with these results, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine failed to increase hippocampal extracellular 5-HT levels in BDNF +/- mice while it produced robust effects in wild-type littermates. Using in-vitro autoradiography and synaptosome techniques, we investigated the causes of attenuated 5-HT reuptake in BDNF +/- mice. A significant decrease in [3H]citalopram-binding-site density in the CA3 subregion of the ventral hippocampus and a significant reduction in [3H]5-HT uptake in hippocampal synaptosomes, revealed mainly a decrease in SERT function. However, 5-HT1A autoreceptors were not desensitized in BDNF +/- mice. These results provide evidence that constitutive reductions in BDNF modulate SERT function reuptake in the hippocampus.",

        "Abstract": "The dentate gyrus (DG) is one of only two brain structures known to retain the ability to produce new neurons in adulthood. The functional significance of adult neurogenesis in the DG is not yet well understood, but recent evidence has implicated adult neurogenesis in the etiology and treatment of depression. Elevated stress hormone levels, which are present in some depressed patients and can precipitate the onset of depression, reduce neurogenesis in animal models. Conversely, virtually all antidepressant treatments studied to date, including drugs of various classes, electroconvulsive therapy, and behavioral treatments, increase neurogenesis in the DG. We critically review this literature linking DG neurogenesis with depression, looking to both animal and human studies. We conclude that a reduction in neurogenesis by itself is not likely to produce depression. However, at least some therapeutic effects of antidepressant treatments appear to be neurogenesis-dependent. We review the cellular pathways through which antidepressant drugs boost neurogenesis and present several hypotheses about how DG neurogenesis may be instrumental in the therapeutic effects of these drugs.",

        "Title": "Antidepressant-induced neurogenesis in the hippocampus of adult nonhuman primates.",
        "Abstract": "New neurons are generated in the adult hippocampus of many species including rodents, monkeys, and humans. Conditions associated with major depression, such as social stress, suppress hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents and primates. In contrast, all classes of antidepressants stimulate neuronal generation, and the behavioral effects of these medications are abolished when neurogenesis is blocked. These findings generated the hypothesis that induction of neurogenesis is a necessary component in the mechanism of action of antidepressant treatments. To date, the effects of antidepressants on newborn neurons have been reported only in rodents and tree shrews. This study examines whether neurogenesis is increased in nonhuman primates after antidepressant treatment. Adult monkeys received repeated electroconvulsive shock (ECS), which is the animal analog of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), the most effective short-term antidepressant. Compared with control conditions, ECS robustly increased precursor cell proliferation in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus in the monkey hippocampus. A majority of these precursors differentiated into neurons or endothelial cells, while a few matured into glial cells. The ECS-mediated induction of cell proliferation and neurogenesis was accompanied by increased immunoreactivity for the neuroprotective gene product BCL2 (B cell chronic lymphocytic lymphoma 2) in the SGZ. The ECS interventions were not accompanied by increased hippocampal cell death or injury. This study demonstrates that ECS is capable of inducing neurogenesis in the nonhuman primate hippocampus and supports the possibility that antidepressant interventions produce similar alterations in the human brain.",

        "Abstract": "We previously reported that chronic, but not subchronic, treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine altered behavior in the forced swimming test (FST) in BALB/cJ mice. We now use this model to investigate mechanisms underlying the delayed onset of the behavioral response to antidepressants, specifically (1) adult hippocampal neurogenesis and (2) expression of the 5-HT1A receptor. Here, we show data validating this model of chronic antidepressant action. We found the FST to be selectively responsive to chronic administration of the SSRI fluoxetine (18 mg/kg/day) and the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (20 mg/kg/day), but not to the antipsychotic haloperidol (1 mg/kg/day) in BALB/cJ mice. The behavioral effects of fluoxetine emerged by 12 days of treatment, and were affected neither by ablation of progenitor cells of the hippocampus nor by genetic deletion of the 5-HT1A receptor. The effect of fluoxetine in the BALB/cJ mice was also neurogenesis-independent in the novelty-induced hypophagia test. We also found that chronic fluoxetine does not induce an increase in cell proliferation or the number of young neurons as measured by BrdU and doublecortin immunolabeling, respectively, in BALB/cJ mice. These data are in contrast to our previous report using a different strain of mice (129SvEvTac). In conclusion, we find that BALB/cJ mice show a robust response to chronic SSRI treatment in the FST, which is not mediated by an increase in new neurons in the hippocampus, and does not require the 5-HT1A receptor. These findings suggest that SSRIs can produce antidepressant-like effects via distinct mechanisms in different mouse strains.",

        "Abstract": "With continued debate over the functional significance of adult neurogenesis, identifying an in vivo correlate of neurogenesis has become an important goal. Here we rely on the coupling between neurogenesis and angiogenesis and test whether MRI measurements of cerebral blood volume (CBV) provide an imaging correlate of neurogenesis. First, we used an MRI approach to generate CBV maps over time in the hippocampal formation of exercising mice. Among all hippocampal subregions, exercise was found to have a primary effect on dentate gyrus CBV, the only subregion that supports adult neurogenesis. Moreover, exercise-induced increases in dentate gyrus CBV were found to correlate with postmortem measurements of neurogenesis. Second, using similar MRI technologies, we generated CBV maps over time in the hippocampal formation of exercising humans. As in mice, exercise was found to have a primary effect on dentate gyrus CBV, and the CBV changes were found to selectively correlate with cardiopulmonary and cognitive function. Taken together, these findings show that dentate gyrus CBV provides an imaging correlate of exercise-induced neurogenesis and that exercise differentially targets the dentate gyrus, a hippocampal subregion important for memory and implicated in cognitive aging.",

        "Abstract": "To explore the function of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, we ablated cell proliferation by using two independent and complementary methods: (i) a focal hippocampal irradiation and (ii) an inducible and reversible genetic elimination of neural progenitor cells. Previous studies using these methods found a weakening of contextual fear conditioning but no change in spatial reference memory, suggesting a supportive role for neurogenesis in some, but not all, hippocampal-dependent memory tasks. In the present study, we examined hippocampal-dependent and -independent working memory using different radial maze tasks. Surprisingly, ablating neurogenesis caused an improvement of hippocampal-dependent working memory when repetitive information was presented in a single day. These findings suggest that adult-born cells in the dentate gyrus have different, and in some cases, opposite roles in distinct types of memory.",

        "Abstract": "The therapeutic effects of chronic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are well documented, yet the elementary behavioral processes that are affected by such treatment have not been fully investigated. We report here the effects of chronic fluoxetine treatment and genetic deletion of the serotonin transporter (SERT) on food reinforced behavior in three paradigms: the progressive ratio operant task, the concurrent choice operant task, and the Pavlovian-to-Instrumental transfer task. We consistently find that chronic pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of SERT result in similar behavioral consequences: reduced operant responding for natural reward. This is in line with previous studies reporting declines in operant responding for drugs and intracranial self-stimulation with fluoxetine treatment, suggesting that the effect of SERT blockade can be generalized to different reward types. Detailed analyses of behavioral parameters indicate that this reduction in operant responding affect both goal-directed and non-goal-directed behaviors without affecting the Pavlovian cue-triggered excessive operant responding. In addition, both pharmacological and genetic manipulations reduce locomotor activity in the open field novel environment. Our data contrast with the effect of dopamine in increasing operant responding for natural reward specifically in goal-directed behaviors and in increasing Pavlovian cue-triggered excessive operant responding. Serotonin and dopamine have been proposed to serve opposing functions in motivational processes. Our data suggest that their interactions do not result in simple opponency. The fact that pharmacological blockade and genetic deletion of SERT have similar behavioral consequences reinforces the utility of the SERT null mice for investigation of the mechanisms underlying chronic SSRIs treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Although hippocampal neurogenesis has been described in many adult mammals, the functional impact of this process on physiology and behavior remains unclear. In the present study, we used two independent methods to ablate hippocampal neurogenesis and found that each procedure caused a limited behavioral deficit and a loss of synaptic plasticity within the dentate gyrus. Specifically, focal X irradiation of the hippocampus or genetic ablation of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive neural progenitor cells impaired contextual fear conditioning but not cued conditioning. Hippocampal-dependent spatial learning tasks such as the Morris water maze and Y maze were unaffected. These findings show that adult-born neurons make a distinct contribution to some but not all hippocampal functions. In a parallel set of experiments, we show that long-term potentiation elicited in the dentate gyrus in the absence of GABA blockers requires the presence of new neurons, as it is eliminated by each of our ablation procedures. These data show that new hippocampal neurons can be preferentially recruited over mature granule cells in vitro and may provide a framework for how this small cell population can influence behavior.",

        "Abstract": "The present studies examined the role of norepinephrine (NE) system in mediating the enhancement of 5-HT function produced by neurokinin (NK)1 receptor antagonism. Dorsal raphe 5-HT and locus coeruleus NE neurons were recorded in vivo in mice lacking NK1 receptors in wildtype mice pretreated with the NK1 antagonist RP67580 and its inactive enantiomer RP 68651. RP67580 and RP68651 were also tested on 5-HT neurons of mice lacking the 5-HT(1A) receptor. RP67580 increased the firing rate of 5-HT neurons in wildtype mice and in 5-HT(1A) null mutant mice to the same degree, thus indicating that the mechanism by which NK1 antagonists enhances 5-HT firing is independent of 5-HT(1A) receptors. NE neuronal burst activity was increased in NK1 null mutant and wildtype mice given RP67580, but not with RP68651. After NE depletion, RP67580 was ineffective in increasing 5-HT neuronal firing activity in NK1 wildtype mice, and the enhancement of 5-HT neuronal firing observed in NK1 null mutant mice was abolished. In conclusion, NE neurons are essential for the action of NK1 antagonists on 5-HT neurons. In addition, the desensitization of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors produced by NK1 receptor antagonism is not critical for enhancing 5-HT neuronal firing.",

        "Title": "Adaptive changes in serotonin neurons of the raphe nuclei in 5-HT(4) receptor knock-out mouse.",
        "Abstract": "Decreased serotonin (5-HT) transmission is thought to underlie several mental diseases, including depression and feeding disorders. However, whether deficits in genes encoding G protein-coupled receptors may down-regulate the activity of 5-HT neurons is unknown currently. Based on recent evidence that stress-induced anorexia may involve 5-HT(4)receptors (5-HT(4)R), we measured various aspects of 5-HT function in 5-HT(4)R knock-out (KO) mice. When compared to dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurons from wild-type mice, those from 5-HT(4)R KO mice exhibited reduced spontaneous electrical activity. This reduced activity was associated with diminished tissue levels of 5-HT and its main metabolite, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA). Cumulative, systemic doses of the 5-HT uptake blocker citalopram, that reduced 5-HT cell firing by 30% in wild-type animals, completely inhibited 5-HT neuron firing in the KO mice. This effect was reversed by administration of the 5-HT(1A) receptor (5-HT(1A)R) antagonist, WAY100635, in mice of both genotypes. Other changes in DRN of the KO mice included increases in the levels of 5-HT plasma membrane transporter sites and mRNA, as well as a decrease in the density of 5-HT(1A)R sites without any change in 5-HT(1A) mRNA content. With the exception of increased 5-HT turnover index in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens and a decreased density of 5-HT(1A)R sites in the dorsal hippocampus (CA1) and septum, no major changes were detected in 5-HT territories of projection, suggesting region-specific adaptive changes. The mechanisms whereby 5-HT(4)R mediate a tonic positive influence on the firing activity of DRN 5-HT neurons and 5-HT content remain to be determined.",

We demonstrate that global disruption of 5-HT2A receptor (5HT2AR) signaling in mice reduces inhibition in conflict anxiety paradigms without affecting fear-conditioned and depression-related behaviors. Selective restoration of 5HT2AR signaling to the cortex normalized conflict anxiety behaviors. These findings indicate a specific role for cortical 5HT2AR function in the modulation of conflict anxiety, consistent with models of cortical, \"top-down\" influences on risk assessment.",

        "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence implicates hippocampal neurogenesis in the pathophysiology of depression. Psychosocial stress reduces neurogenesis in rodents, whereas chronic treatment with antidepressants increases neurogenesis and blocks the effects of stress. The effects of stress and antidepressant treatment on hippocampal neurogenesis parallel behavioral changes in animal models. Moreover, ablating hippocampal neurogenesis renders antidepressants inactive in behavioral paradigms used to model antidepressant response and anxiety-like behavior in mice. In humans, monoamine-modulating antidepressants demonstrate clinical efficacy in treating depression and anxiety, which are often precipitated by psychosocial stress. This review examines the mounting evidence that stress and antidepressant treatment regulate neurogenesis in animals. Special attention is paid to the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which this regulation takes place. An analysis of current animal models used to study response to stress and antidepressants indicates the importance of modeling chronic treatment, which reflects both changes in neurogenesis and clinical response. Exploring responses of hippocampal neurogenesis to experimental challenges in appropriate animal models should delineate the role of adult-born neurons in hippocampal physiology. Focusing on neurogenic response to experimental paradigms of stress and antidepressant treatment is particularly interesting for understanding the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder.",

To investigate a causal link between these two observations, we analyzed the effect of enrichment on spatial learning and anxiety-like behavior while blocking adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter glutamate has been thought to derive mainly from glutamine via the action of glutaminase type 1 (GLS1). To address the importance of this pathway in glutamatergic transmission, we knocked out GLS1 in mice. The insertion of a STOP cassette by homologous recombination produced a null allele that blocked transcription, encoded no immunoreactive protein, and abolished GLS1 enzymatic activity. Null mutants were slightly smaller, were deficient in goal-directed behavior, hypoventilated, and died in the first postnatal day. No gross or microscopic defects were detected in peripheral organs or in the CNS. In cultured neurons from the null mutants, miniature EPSC amplitude and duration were normal; however, the amplitude of evoked EPSCs decayed more rapidly with sustained 10 Hz stimulation, consistent with an observed reduction in depolarization-evoked glutamate release. Because of this activity-dependent impairment in glutamatergic transmission, we surmised that respiratory networks, which require temporal summation of synaptic input, would be particularly affected. We found that the amplitude of inspirations was decreased in vivo, chemosensitivity to CO2 was severely altered, and the frequency of pacemaker activity recorded in the respiratory generator in the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex, a glutamatergic brainstem network that can be isolated in vitro, was increased. Our results show that although alternate pathways to GLS1 glutamate synthesis support baseline glutamatergic transmission, the GLS1 pathway is essential for maintaining the function of active synapses, and thus the mutation is associated with impaired respiratory function, abnormal goal-directed behavior, and neonatal demise.",

Here we discuss advances in our understanding of the genetics of affective and anxiety disorders. In particular, we highlight our growing understanding of specific gene-environment interactions that occur during critical periods in development, setting the stage for later behavioral phenotypes. We review the recent literature in the field, focusing on recent advances in our understanding of the role of the serotonin system in establishing normal anxiety levels during development. We emphasize the importance of understanding the effect of genetic variation at the level of functional circuits and provide examples from the literature of how such an approach has been exploited to study novel genetic endpoints, including genetically based variation in response to medication, a potentially valuable phenotype that has not received much attention to date.",

        "Abstract": "Mice lacking the serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT(1A)R) show increased levels of anxiety-related behavior across multiple tests and background strains. Tissue-specific rescue experiments, lesion studies, and neurophysiological findings all point toward the hippocampus as a potential mediator of the phenotype. Serotonin, acting through 5-HT(1A)Rs, can suppress hippocampal theta-frequency oscillations, suggesting that theta oscillations might be increased in the knock-outs. To test this hypothesis, local field potential recordings were obtained from the hippocampus of awake, behaving knock-outs and wild-type littermates. The magnitude of theta oscillations was increased in the knock-outs, specifically in the anxiety-provoking elevated plus maze and not in a familiar environment or during rapid eye movement sleep. Theta power correlated with the fraction of time spent in the open arms, an anxiety-related behavioral variable. These results suggest a possible role for the hippocampus, and theta oscillations in particular, in the expression of anxiety in 5-HT(1A)R-deficient mice.",

        "Abstract": "Serotonin 1A receptor knockout (5-HT1AR KO) mice exhibit increased behavioral inhibition in conflict tests. To gain further insight into their anxiety-related phenotype, we subjected these mice to additional behavioral tests. First, we considered whether behavioral inhibition in these knockout mice is a consequence of reduced exploratory motivation. The knockout mice engage in normal exploration during a light-dark test and normal exploration of a novel object in a familiar environment, suggesting that the anxiety-related phenotype is not due to reduced exploratory drive. Second, we tested whether these mice exhibit increased behavioral inhibition in response to any aversive cues, or whether this response depends on cue modality. Knockout mice respond normally to discrete aversive cues in the Vogel lick-suppression test, arguing that their phenotype is restricted to conflict tests based on complex or spatial aversive cues. Third, to probe the processing of spatial aversive cues, we assessed fear conditioning to contextual cues. After contextual fear conditioning, knockout and wild-type (WT) mice express freezing responses when exposed to the training environment. However, when placed in an ambiguous environment containing both conditioned and novel cues, the freezing response of knockout mice does not significantly decrease as it does in WT mice, suggesting that the knockout fear response is biased toward threatening cues. We hypothesize that this inappropriate generalization of fearful behavior to a context containing both fearful and neutral stimuli, a phenomenon that occurs in a subset of human anxiety disorders such as panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, underlies the anxiety phenotype of 5-HT1AR KO mice.",

        "Title": "Recent advances in animal models of chronic antidepressant effects: the novelty-induced hypophagia test.",
        "Abstract": "Animal models exhibiting sensitivity to chronic, but not acute, antidepressant treatment are greatly needed for studying the neural mechanisms of the antidepressant response. Although several models of acute antidepressant effects provide excellent tools for antidepressant discovery, they do not permit investigation into their therapeutic effects, which require several weeks of treatment to emerge. The inhibition of feeding produced by novelty, termed 'hyponeophagia', provides an anxiety-related measure that is sensitive to the effects of chronic, but not acute or subchronic, antidepressant treatment. This review evaluates the value of hyponeophagia-based tests as tools for investigating the neurobiology of the therapeutic response to antidepressant treatment. Criteria for the development and validation of animal models used to study neurobiological mechanisms of the antidepressant response are presented. Methodological considerations affecting the reliability, specificity, and ease of use of hyponeophagia-based models are also discussed. Lastly, we present a newly revised hyponeophagia paradigm, called the novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) test, which attempts to maximize the predictive validity and practicality of the test. The NIH paradigm provides a promising new model for investigations into the neurobiology underlying the antidepressant response.",

        "Abstract": "We used a knock-in strategy to generate two lines of mice expressing Cre recombinase under the transcriptional control of the dopamine transporter promoter (DAT-cre mice) or the serotonin transporter promoter (SERT-cre mice). In DAT-cre mice, immunocytochemical staining of adult brains for the dopamine-synthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase and for Cre recombinase revealed that virtually all dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain expressed Cre. Crossing DAT-cre mice with ROSA26-stop-lacZ or ROSA26-stop-YFP reporter mice revealed a near perfect correlation between staining for tyrosine hydroxylase and beta-galactosidase or YFP. YFP-labeled fluorescent dopaminergic neurons could be readily identified in live slices. Crossing SERT-cre mice with the ROSA26-stop-lacZ or ROSA26-stop-YFP reporter mice similarly revealed a near perfect correlation between staining for serotonin-synthetic enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase and beta-galactosidase or YFP. Additional Cre expression in the thalamus and cortex was observed, reflecting the known pattern of transient SERT expression during early postnatal development. These findings suggest a general strategy of using neurotransmitter transporter promoters to drive selective Cre expression and thus control mutations in specific neurotransmitter systems. Crossed with fluorescent-gene reporters, this strategy tags neurons by neurotransmitter status, providing new tools for electrophysiology and imaging.",

The functional integration of neurons generated in the adult was first demonstrated in songbirds more than two decades ago. In the adult mammalian brain, neurons are continuously generated in two structures, the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus. Current evidence suggests that adult-born immature neurons have distinct electrophysiological properties from old neurons, and proposed roles in a variety of functions including olfaction, learning and mood regulation.",

        "Abstract": "3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy') is a psychoactive substance, first described as an appetite suppressant in humans, inducing side effects and even death. MDMA increases serotonin (5-HT) levels, and 5-HT inhibits food intake, but the 5-HT receptors involved in MDMA-induced changes in feeding behavior are unknown. We examined whether a systemic MDMA injection would reduce the physiological drive to eat in starved mice and tested if the inactivation of 5-HT1B or 5-HT2C receptors could restore this response. Our results indicate that in starved mice, MDMA (10 mg/kg) provoked an initial hypophagia for 1 h (-77%) followed by a period of hyperphagia (studied between 1 and 3 h). This biphasic feeding behavior due to MDMA treatment was maintained in 5-HT1B receptor-null mice or in animals treated with the 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist GR127935 (3 or 10 mg/kg). In contrast, MDMA-induced hypophagia (for the first 1 h period) was suppressed when combined with the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist RS102221 (2 mg/kg). However, RS102221 did not alter MDMA-induced hyperphagia (for the 1-3 h period) but did exert a stimulant effect, when administered alone, during that period. We have previously shown that MDMA or 5-HT1A/1B receptor agonist RU24969 fails to stimulate locomotor activity in 5-HT1B receptor-null mice. Our present data indicate that the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist RS102221 suppresses MDMA-induced hyperlocomotion. These findings provide the first evidence that the inactivation of 5-HT2C receptors may reduce hypophagia and motor response to MDMA, while a genetic deficit or pharmacological inactivation of 5-HT1B receptors was insufficient to alter the feeding response to MDMA.",

In addition it is becoming increasingly clear that these factors interact to produce specific anxiety-related behaviors. For example, in humans and in monkeys mutations in the gene encoding for the serotonin transporter result in increased anxiety in adult life when combined with a stressful environment during development. Another recent example comes from twin studies suggesting that a small hippocampus can be a predisposing condition that renders individuals susceptible to post traumatic stress disorder. Such examples illustrate how specific mutations leading to abnormal brain development may increase vulnerability to environmental insults which may in turn lead to specific anxiety disorders.",

Using fMRI, we investigated the neural responses associated with the conscious and unconscious (backwardly masked) perception of fearful faces in healthy volunteers who varied in threat sensitivity (Spielberger trait anxiety scale). Unconscious processing modulated activity only in the basolateral subregion of the amygdala, while conscious processing modulated activity only in the dorsal amygdala (containing the central nucleus). Whereas activation of the dorsal amygdala by conscious stimuli was consistent across subjects and independent of trait anxiety, activity in the basolateral amygdala to unconscious stimuli, and subjects' reaction times, were predicted by individual differences in trait anxiety. These findings provide a biological basis for the unconscious emotional vigilance characteristic of anxiety and a means for investigating the mechanisms and efficacy of treatments for anxiety.",

        "Abstract": "The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptor 1A is involved in many physiological functions, including the regulation of learning and memory by acting either as an autoreceptor located on 5-HT neurons (raphe nuclei) or as a heteroreceptor on non-5-HT neurons, mainly in the hippocampal formation. To investigate whether the effects of 5-HT via 5-HT1A receptors on learning are age-sensitive, we evaluated the performance of young-adult (3 months old) and aged (22 months old) 5-HT1A knockout (KO) mice and their homologous wild types (WT) in the hippocampal-dependent spatial reference memory version of the Morris water maze. We demonstrated that young-adult 5-HT1AKO mice exhibit an impairment in learning and retention of the spatial task, as compared to WT mice, without showing any sign of change in their sensori-motor and locomotor abilities or motivation. This genotype effect does not persist during aging. In fact, aged 5-HT1AKO mice seem to be slightly facilitated during the early stages of learning. These results are consistent with a possible prevalence of 5-HT1A raphe functions in learning and memory abilities of young-adult animals, since the effects of the mutation on mice performance (impairment) are opposite to those found after intra-raphe injection of 5-HT1A agonists (facilitation), and with data showing increased activity of 5-HT neurons in 5-HT1AKO mice. The reduced effect of the mutation in aged animals possibly reflects the lower efficacy of autoreceptors due to aging and/or a prevalence of hippocampal heteroreceptors.",

        "Abstract": "Reduced serotonin transporter (5-HTT) expression is associated with abnormal affective and anxiety-like symptoms in humans and rodents, but the mechanism of this effect is unknown. Transient inhibition of 5-HTT during early development with fluoxetine, a commonly used serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor, produced abnormal emotional behaviors in adult mice. This effect mimicked the behavioral phenotype of mice genetically deficient in 5-HTT expression. These findings indicate a critical role of serotonin in the maturation of brain systems that modulate emotional function in the adult and suggest a developmental mechanism to explain how low-expressing 5-HTT promoter alleles increase vulnerability to psychiatric disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Serotonin is an important modulator of anxiety and thus drugs that act on this system have frequently been shown to be either anxiogenic or anxiolytic. In addition serotonin has important trophic functions during early development and disruption of serotonin homeostasis is likely to have long-lasting repercussions in the adult. In the present study we examined the contribution of two serotonin receptor subtypes (5HT(1A) and 5HT(1B)) to the pathophysiology of anxiety during development. For this, we have studied homozygous knockout mice lacking the 5HT(1B) receptor and examined the effect of pharmacological manipulations of 5HT(1A) and 5HT(1B) receptors on locomotor activity and emission of ultrasonic vocalization (USV) in 7-8 days old mice. As shown before, drug na\u00efve 5HT(1B) knockout pups showed reduced USV and were hyperactive, in comparison to wild type controls. The administration of RU24969 (a 5HT(1A/1B) agonist) showed a dose-dependent decrease in USV in the wild type and a biphasic effect in the mutants and resulted in dose-dependent increase in activity in the wild type and, to a lesser extent, in the knockouts. The selective 5HT(1A) agonist, 8OH-DPAT, dose-dependently blocked vocalization in both genotypes and also increased locomotion. To differentially activate 5HT(1B) receptors we first blocked 5HT(1A) receptors with WAY100315 and then treated with RU24969. At a high testing temperature, pretreatment with WAY100315 resulted in an anxiogenic effect in wild type pups but not in the knockouts. In agreement with our findings that 5HT(1B) knockout mice were in general less sensitive to 5HT(1A) activation, 5HT(1A) receptor binding was reduced in the knockouts in comparison to controls. Finally, treatment with diazepam dose-dependently decreased USVs in both group with the knockouts showing enhanced sensitivity to this drug. Our results show that important adaptations to a disturbance of serotonin homeostasis occur during the first week of life within the serotonergic system. The observed decreased in sensitivity of 5HT(1B) knockout mice to 5HT(1A) and increased to GABA(A) manipulations are discussed within the context of serotonergic plasticity during development and the implication for clinical treatment of anxiety in genetically predisposed individuals.",

Recently, genetic approaches have been used to clarify the role of heredity in the development of anxiety and to probe its neurobiological underpinnings. Twin studies have shown that a significant proportion of the liability to develop any given anxiety disorder is due to genetic factors. Ongoing efforts to map anxiety-related loci in both animals and humans are underway with limited success to date. Animal models have played a large role in furthering our understanding of the genetic basis of anxiety, demonstrating that the genetic factors underlying anxiety are complex and varied. Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques have allowed increasing specificity in the manipulation of gene expression within the central nervous system of the mouse. With this increasing specificity has come the ability to ask and answer precise questions about the mechanisms of anxiety and its treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Substance P (neurokinin-1 [NK1]) receptor antagonists appear to be effective antidepressant and anxiolytic agents, as indicated in 3 double-blind clinical trials. In laboratory animals, they promptly attenuate the responsiveness of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) and norepinephrine (NE) neurons to agonists of their cell-body autoreceptors, as is the case for some antidepressant drugs that are currently in clinical use. Long-term, but not subacute, antagonism of NK1 receptors in rats increases 5-HT transmission in the hippocampus, a property common to all antidepressant treatments tested thus far. This enhancement seems to be mediated by a time-dependent increase in the firing rate of 5-HT neurons. Mice with the NK1 receptor deleted from their genetic code also have an increased firing rate of 5-HT neurons. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that NK1 antagonists could become a new class of antidepressant and anxiolytic agents.",

The male mutant mice exhibit a hyposensitivity to anorexic stress. Our recent data indicate that the pharmacological inactivation, using a systemic injection of the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist RS39604 (0.5 mg/kg), suppressed restraint stress-induced anorexia in wild-type female mice. In parallel, the same treatment reduced the 3,4-N-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (\" ecstasy\", 10 mg/kg)-induced anorexia in male wild-type mice. Our neurochemical analyses suggest that the mechanisms underlying feeding disorders in 5-HT4 receptor knockout mice are related to a lesser efficacy of 5-HT (hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens), leptin and the cocaine-amphetamine related transcript to reduce food intake following stress.",

        "Abstract": "The functional properties of GABA(B) receptors were examined in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the hippocampus of knock-out mice devoid of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT-/-) or the 5-HT(1A) receptor (5-HT(1A)-/-). Electrophysiological recordings in brain slices showed that the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen caused a lower hyperpolarization and neuronal firing inhibition of DRN 5-HT cells in 5-HTT-/- versus 5-HTT+/+ mice. In addition, [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S binding induced by GABA(B) receptor stimulation in the DRN was approximately 40% less in these mutants compared with wild-type mice. In contrast, GABA(B) receptors appeared functionally intact in the hippocampus of 5-HTT-/-, and in both this area and the DRN of 5-HT(1A)-knock-out mice. The unique functional changes of DRN GABA(B) receptors closely resembled those of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors in 5-HTT-/- mice, further supporting the idea that both receptor types are coupled to a common pool of G-proteins in serotoninergic neurons.",

        "Abstract": "The onset of the therapeutic response to antidepressant treatment exhibits a characteristic delay. Animal models sensitive to chronic, but not acute, antidepressant treatment are greatly needed for studying antidepressant mechanisms. We initially assessed four inbred mouse strains for their behavioral response to chronic treatment with the selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (0, 5, 10 mg/kg/day in drinking water), which is used for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. Only the highly anxious BALB/c strain exhibited sensitivity to fluoxetine in the forced swim test. Additionally, fluoxetine reduced locomotion in C57BL/6 and 129SvEv, but not BALB/c and DBA/2, strains. We then evaluated the effects of subchronic (approximately 4 days) and chronic (approximately 24 days) fluoxetine treatment (0, 10, 18, 25 mg/kg/day) on measures of anxiety and depression in BALB/c mice. Anxiety measures were obtained using the open field and novelty-induced hypophagia tests. Antidepressant effects were evaluated using the forced swim test. We found 18 mg/kg/day of chronic fluoxetine to be active in all three paradigms; subchronic treatment had no effect. Anxiety-related measures were reduced by 18 mg/kg/day. In the forced swim test, 10 and 18 mg/kg/day increased swimming and reduced immobility. Here we present several novel effects of chronic, but not subchronic, antidepressant treatment.",

        "Title": "Adaption of the serotoninergic neuronal phenotype in the absence of 5-HT autoreceptors or the 5-HT transporter: involvement of BDNF and cAMP.",
        "Abstract": "Serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors and the 5-HT transporter are key regulators of the serotoninergic neuronal phenotype. We show here that genetic deletion of any of these elements differentially regulates 5-HT neuronal number in rostral raphe cultures from E14 mice. Serotonin neuronal number was increased by almost four-fold and 1.8-fold in cultures from 5-HT1AR-/- and 5-HT1BR-/- mice, respectively. In contrast, the lack of serotonin transporter expression was associated with a 50% decrease in 5-HT neuronal number. In raphe cultures from the rat, BDNF and cAMP have been shown to up-regulate the neuronal serotoninergic phenotype through TrkB-dependent mechanisms [Rumajogee et al. (2002) J. Neurochem., 83, 1525-1528]. Similar tyrosine kinase-dependent up-regulating effects, in the absence of serotoninergic key-elements are reported here, on both 5-HT neuronal number and neurites length. However, the extents of BDNF-triggered and cAMP-triggered effects on serotoninergic neuritic length were approximately 1.5-fold higher in 5-HT1AR-/- mutants. These findings show that the up-regulatory mechanisms triggered by BDNF on serotoninergic neuronal number and neurite extension are different and that the latter are partially linked to 5-HT, probably through 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Together, these data suggest that serotonin autoreceptors, mainly 5-HT1A but also 5-HT1B, may be responsible for a tonic auto-inhibitory effect of 5-HT itself on the serotoninergic neuronal phenotype during embryonic development, particularly marked in the absence of the 5-HT transporter.",

        "Abstract": "The wide use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin receptor agonists in anxiety disorders has suggested a key role for the modulatory neurotransmitter in anxiety. However, serotonin's specific role is still uncertain. This article reviews the literature concerning how and where serotonergic agents modulate anxiety. Varying and sometimes conflicting data from human and animal studies argue for both anxiolytic and anxiogenic roles for serotonin, depending on the specific disorder, structure, or behavioral task studied. However, recent data from molecular genetic studies in the mouse point toward two important roles for the serotonin 1A receptor. In development, serotonin acts through this receptor to promote development of the circuitry necessary for normal anxiety-like behaviors. In adulthood, serotonin reuptake inhibitors act through the same receptor to stimulate neurogenesis and reduce anxiety-like behaviors. These studies highlight that the complex serotonin system likely plays various roles in the regulation of anxiety both during development and in adulthood.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine neurons are thought to convey a fast, incentive salience signal, faster than can be mediated by dopamine. A resolution of this paradox may be that midbrain dopamine neurons exert fast excitatory actions. Using transgenic mice with fluorescent dopamine neurons, in which the axonal projections of the neurons are visible, we made horizontal brain slices encompassing the mesoaccumbens dopamine projection. Focal extracellular stimulation of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area evoked dopamine release and early monosynaptic and late polysynaptic excitatory responses in postsynaptic nucleus accumbens neurons. Local superfusion of the ventral tegmental area with glutamate, which should activate dopamine neurons selectively, produced an increase in excitatory synaptic events. Local superfusion of the ventral tegmental area with the D2 agonist quinpirole, which should increase the threshold for dopamine neuron activation, inhibited the early response. So dopamine neurons make glutamatergic synaptic connections to accumbens neurons. We propose that dopamine neuron glutamatergic transmission may be the initial component of the incentive salience signal.",

Specifically, stress-induced hypophagia and novelty-induced exploratory activity were attenuated in the knock-out mice. In addition, pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsive responses were enhanced in the knock-out mice, suggesting an increase in neuronal network excitability. These results provide the first example of a genetic deficit that disrupts the ability of stress to reduce feeding and body weight and suggest that 5-HT4 receptors may be involved in stress-induced anorexia and seizure susceptibility.",

        "Abstract": "Age-related memory decline is associated with a combined dysfunction of the cholinergic and serotonergic systems in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, in particular. The 5-HT1B receptor occupies strategic cellular and subcellular locations in these structures, where it plays a role in the modulation of ACh release. In an attempt to characterize the contribution of this receptor to memory functions, 5-HT1B receptor knockout (KO) mice were submitted to various behavioral paradigms carried out in the same experimental context (water maze), which were aimed at exposing mice to various levels of memory demand. 5-HT1BKO mice exhibited a facilitation in the acquisition of a hippocampal-dependent spatial reference memory task in the Morris water maze. This facilitation was selective of task difficulty, showing thus that the genetic inactivation of the 5-HT1B receptor is associated with facilitation when the complexity of the task is increased, and reveals a protective effect on age-related hippocampal-dependent memory decline. Young-adult and aged KO and wild-type (WT) mice were equally able to learn a delayed spatial matching-to-sample working memory task in a radial-arm water maze with short (0 or 5 min) delays. However, 5-HT1BKO mice, only, exhibited a selective memory impairment at intermediate and long (15, 30, and 60 min) delays. Treatment by scopolamine induced the same pattern of performance in wild type as did the mutation for short (5 min, no impairment) and long (60 min, impairment) delays. Taken together, these studies revealed a beneficial effect of the mutation on the acquisition of a spatial reference memory task, but a deleterious effect on a working memory task for long delays. This 5-HT1BKO mouse story highlights the problem of the potential existence of \"global memory enhancers.\"",

        "Abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT) plays a modulatory role in mnemonic functions, especially by interacting with the cholinergic system. The 5-HT1B receptor is a key target of this interaction. The 5-HT1B receptor knockout mice were found previously to exhibit a facilitation in hippocampal-dependent spatial reference memory learning. In the present study, we submitted mice to a delayed spatial working memory task, allowing the introduction of various delays between an exposure trial and a test trial. The 5-HT1BKO and wild-type mice learned the task in a radial-arm water maze (returning to the most recent presented arm containing the escape platform), and exhibited a high level of performance at delays of 0 and 5 min. However, at the delay of 60 min, only 5-HT1BKO mice exhibited an impairment. At a delay of 90 min, all mice were impaired. Treatment by scopolamine (0.8 mg/kg) induced the same pattern of performance in wild type as did the mutation for short (5 min, no impairment) and long (60 min, impairment) delays. The 22-month-old wild-type and knockout mice exhibited an impairment at short delays (5 and 15 min). The effect of the mutation affected both young-adult and aged mice at delays of 15, 30, and 60 min. Neurobiological data show that stimulation of the 5-HT1B receptor inhibits the release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus, but stimulates this in the frontal cortex. This dual function might, at least in part, explain the opposite effect of the mutation on reference memory (facilitation) and delay-dependent working memory (impairment). These results support the idea that cholinergic-serotonergic interactions play an important role in memory processes.",

        "Abstract": "Most neuropharmacological agents and many drugs of abuse modulate the activity of heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptors. Although the effects of these ligands result from changes in cellular signaling, their neurobehavioral activity may not correlate with results of in vitro signal transduction assays. 5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) partial agonists that have similar pharmacological profiles differ in the behavioral responses they elicit. In vitro studies suggest that different agonists acting at the same receptor may establish distinct patterns of signal transduction. Testing this hypothesis in the brain requires a global signal transduction assay that is applicable in vivo. To distinguish the cellular effects of the different 5-HT2AR agonists, we developed an assay for global signal transduction on the basis of high throughput quantification of rapidly modulated transcripts. Study of the responses to agonists in human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing 5-HT2ARs demonstrated that each agonist elicits a distinct transcriptome fingerprint. We therefore studied behavioral and cortical signal transduction responses in wild-type and 5-HT2AR null-mutant mice. The hallucinogenic chemicals (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) stimulated a head-twitch behavioral response that was not observed with the nonhallucinogenic lisuride hydrogen maleate (LHM) and was absent in receptor null-mutant mice. We also found that DOI, LSD, and LHM each induced distinct transcriptome fingerprints in somatosensory cortex that were absent in 5-HT2AR null-mutants. Moreover, DOI and LSD showed similarities in the transcriptome fingerprints obtained that were not observed with the behaviorally inactive drug LHM. Our results demonstrate that chemicals acting at the 5-HT2AR induce specific cellular response patterns in vivo that are reflected in unique changes in the somatosensory cortex transcriptome.",

        "Abstract": "Various chronic antidepressant treatments increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis, but the functional importance of this phenomenon remains unclear. Here, using genetic and radiological methods, we show that disrupting antidepressant-induced neurogenesis blocks behavioral responses to antidepressants. Serotonin 1A receptor null mice were insensitive to the neurogenic and behavioral effects of fluoxetine, a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor. X-irradiation of a restricted region of mouse brain containing the hippocampus prevented the neurogenic and behavioral effects of two classes of antidepressants. These findings suggest that the behavioral effects of chronic antidepressants may be mediated by the stimulation of neurogenesis in the hippocampus.",

        "Abstract": "We previously observed that 5 months old serotonin 1B receptor knockout (5-HT1BKO) mice exhibited a facilitation of learning in a long-term spatial memory task in a water maze. In this study, we attempted to assess whether this effect might persist during aging. We compared the performances of young-adult (3 months old) and aged (22 months old) 5-HT1BKO and wild type (WT) mice in the same task. Young-adult and aged KO mice exhibited facilitated acquisition of the reference memory task as compared to their respective WT controls. Generally, the performance of aged KO was similar to that of young-adult WT on the parameters defining performance and motor (swim speed) aspects of the task. During probe trials, all mice presented a spatial selectivity, which was, however, less pronounced in aged than in young-adult WT. No such age-related effect was observed in KO mice. In a massed spatial learning task, aged KO and WT mice globally exhibited the same level of performance. Nevertheless, young-adult and aged KO mice were superior to their WT controls as concerns the working memory component of the task. The data suggest that 5-HT1BKO mice are more resistant than WT to age-related memory decline as concerns both reference/long-term and working/short-term spatial memory.",

        "Title": "5-HT 1A/1B receptor-mediated effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram, on sleep: studies in 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 1B knockout mice.",
        "Abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are extensively used for the treatment of depression. Aside from their antidepressant properties, they provoke a deficit in paradoxical sleep (PS) that is most probably mediated by the transporter blockade-induced increase in serotonin concentration in the extracellular space. Such an effect can be accounted for by the action of serotonin at various types of serotonergic receptors involved in PS regulation, among which the 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) types are the best candidates. According to this hypothesis, we examined the effects of citalopram, the most selective SSRI available to date, on sleep in the mouse after inactivation of 5-HT(1A) or 5-HT(1B) receptors, either by homologous recombination of their encoding genes, or pharmacological blockade with selective antagonists. For this purpose, sleep parameters of knockout mice that do not express these receptors and their wild-type counterparts were monitored during 8 h after injection of citalopram alone or in association with 5-HT(1A) or 5-HT(1B) receptor antagonists. Citalopram induced mainly a dose-dependent inhibition of PS during 2-6 h after injection, which was observed in wild-type and 5-HT(1B)-/- mice, but not in 5-HT(1A)-/- mutants. This PS inhibition was fully antagonized by pretreatment with the 5-HT(1A) antagonist WAY 100635, but only partially with the 5-HT(1B) antagonist GR 127935. These data indicate that the action of the SSRI citalopram on sleep in the mouse is essentially mediated by 5-HT(1A) receptors. Such a mechanism of action provides further support to the clinical strategy of antidepressant augmentation by 5-HT(1A) antagonists, because the latter would also counteract the direct sleep-inhibitory side-effects of SSRIs.",

        "Abstract": "Depression and anxiety are among the most common diseases in the United States, thus constituting a substantial financial burden for the health care system. Experimental studies of these affective disorders to date have largely focused on the neurotransmitter pathways with well-established pathophysiologic roles, such as serotonergic, noradrenergic, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic systems; agents modulating the activity of these pathways are known to be clinically effective. More recently, the neuropeptide substance P (SP) and its receptor (the neurokinin-1 receptor [NK1R]) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of affective disorders, including depression. Earlier preclinical and clinical studies, though, did not provide a clear consensus on the role of SP in the regulation of affective behavior and related pathologic conditions. Recent studies in mice clearly demonstrate that both the genetic disruption and acute pharmacologic blockade of the NK1R result in marked reduction in anxiety-like behavior and stress-related responses. In parallel with these behavioral effects, physiologic changes, such as an increased firing rate of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nuclei and a desensitization of presynaptic 5-HT1A inhibitory autoreceptors, were observed. These findings provide further evidence for the regulatory role of the SP-NK1R system in modulation of affective behavior and indicate that its effects are mediated, at least in part, via the serotonergic system. Future studies will attempt to delineate the interaction between the SP-NK1R system and various neurotransmitter pathways in greater detail and to address the specific role(s) of this system in different brain regions.",

        "Abstract": "The influence of the pre- and postweaning maternal environment on the offspring's phenotype was examined in 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor knockout mice (KO1A and KO1B, respectively). We have previously shown that, when born to and raised by homozygous dams of the same genotype, adult KO1A are more anxious than wild-type (WT) mice, and adult KO1B are hyperactive and slightly less anxious than WT mice. We extend our studies here to the behavioral results of the offspring's own genotype, when the dam's genotype is constant, and the effects of the dam's genotype when the offspring's genotype is constant. In Experiments 1 and 2, KO1A-/- pups produced less ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) than controls in an isolation test on postnatal Day 7 when born to and reared by KO1A dams, either -/- or +/-. Heterozygous F1 pups reared by KO1A-/- dams produced more USV and were less anxious in the plus-maze at 2 to 3 months of age than F1 pups born to and reared by WT dams (Experiment 3). F1 pups reared by KO1B-/- dams produced less USV and were more anxious in the plus-maze than F1 pups reared by WT dams (Experiment 4). The results support a role for maternal effects that may comprise direct effects such as the dam's behavior and nutritional care of the pup, and possibly more complex indirect effects through the establishment of idiosyncratic dam-pup dyadic interactions. We recommend that breeding techniques that rely on same genotype (mutant-mutant or WT-WT) breeding pairs not be used to generate offspring when the focus of research is the study of gene function, but rather when familial effects need to be studied.",

        "Title": "Different data from different labs: lessons from studies of gene-environment interaction.",
        "Abstract": "It is sometimes supposed that standardizing tests of mouse behavior will ensure similar results in different laboratories. We evaluated this supposition by conducting behavioral tests with identical apparatus and test protocols in independent laboratories. Eight genetic groups of mice, including equal numbers of males and females, were either bred locally or shipped from the supplier and then tested on six behaviors simultaneously in three laboratories (Albany, NY; Edmonton, AB; Portland, OR). The behaviors included locomotor activity in a small box, the elevated plus maze, accelerating rotarod, visible platform water escape, cocaine activation of locomotor activity, and ethanol preference in a two-bottle test. A preliminary report of this study presented a conventional analysis of conventional measures that revealed strong effects of both genotype and laboratory as well as noteworthy interactions between genotype and laboratory. We now report a more detailed analysis of additional measures and view the data for each test in different ways. Whether mice were shipped from a supplier or bred locally had negligible effects for almost every measure in the six tests, and sex differences were also absent or very small for most behaviors, whereas genetic effects were almost always large. For locomotor activity, cocaine activation, and elevated plus maze, the analysis demonstrated the strong dependence of genetic differences in behavior on the laboratory giving the tests. For ethanol preference and water escape learning, on the other hand, the three labs obtained essentially the same results for key indicators of behavior. Thus, it is clear that the strong dependence of results on the specific laboratory is itself dependent on the task in question. Our results suggest that there may be advantages of test standardization, but laboratory environments probably can never be made sufficiently similar to guarantee identical results on a wide range of tests in a wide range of labs. Interpretations of our results by colleagues in neuroscience as well as the mass media are reviewed. Pessimistic views, prevalent in the media but relatively uncommon among neuroscientists, of mouse behavioral tests as being highly unreliable are contradicted by our data. Despite the presence of noteworthy interactions between genotype and lab environment, most of the larger differences between inbred strains were replicated across the three labs. Strain differences of moderate effects size, on the other hand, often differed markedly among labs, especially those involving three 129-derived strains. Implications for behavioral screening of targeted and induced mutations in mice are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is most commonly a sporadic illness, and is characterized by degeneration of substantia nigra dopamine (DA) neurons and abnormal cytoplasmic aggregates of alpha-synuclein. Rarely, PD may be caused by missense mutations in alpha-synuclein. MPTP, a neurotoxin that inhibits mitochondrial complex I, is a prototype for an environmental cause of PD because it produces a pattern of DA neurodegeneration that closely resembles the neuropathology of PD. Here we show that alpha-synuclein null mice display striking resistance to MPTP-induced degeneration of DA neurons and DA release, and this resistance appears to result from an inability of the toxin to inhibit complex I. Contrary to predictions from in vitro data, this resistance is not due to abnormalities of the DA transporter, which appears to function normally in alpha-synuclein null mice. Our results suggest that some genetic and environmental factors that increase susceptibility to PD may interact with a common molecular pathway, and represent the first demonstration that normal alpha-synuclein function may be important to DA neuron viability.",

        "Abstract": "1 The role of the 5-Hydroxytryptamine(1B) (5-HT(1B)) receptor subtype in masculine sexual behaviour in mice was analysed in both 5-HT(1B) receptor knockout (KO(1B)) and wild-type (WT) animals. 2 Comparison of male copulatory behaviour of WT and KO(1B) strains revealed that KO(1B) mice become interested earlier in sexual behaviour, but require more stimulation to achieve ejaculation than its corresponding WT strain. 3 The pharmacological manipulation of male sexual activity in the WT strain showed that the serotonin precursor 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), the 5-HT(1B) agonist (1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine (TFMPP) and the 5-Hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT(1A)) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylamino-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) all inhibited male copulatory behaviour in mice. 4 In KO(1B) mice, TFMPP lacked an effect, 5-HTP exerted a mild inhibitory effect while 8-OH-DPAT provoked only a tendency towards a reduction in the percentage of animals that achieved ejaculation. In general, KO(1B) mice were less sensitive to the inhibitory actions of 5-HTP and 8-OH-DPAT than the WT strain. 5 Based on these results, we can suggest that serotonin plays a general inhibitory role in the sexual behaviour of male mice and that both 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1A) receptor subtypes participate in the inhibitory actions of this neurotransmitter. 6 The absence of the 5-HT(1B) receptor subtype affected both components of mouse masculine sexual behaviour, motivation and execution, further confirming the involvement of this receptor subtype in the control of this behaviour. In addition, the diminished sensitivity to serotonergic stimulation exhibited by KO(1B) mice suggests the occurrence of compensatory changes as a consequence of the absence of the 5-HT(1B) receptor subtype.",

        "Abstract": "The characterization and anatomical distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(7) receptor binding sites in brain tissue has been hampered by the lack of a specific radioligand. In the present autoradiographic study, we took advantage of 5-HT(1A) knockout and 5-HT(1A/1B) double-knockout mice to revisit the pharmacological characterization and anatomical localization of 5-HT(7) binding sites in mouse brain using [(3)H]5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) and [(3)H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetraline (8-OH-DPAT). The distribution pattern of [(3)H]5-CT binding sites (2 nM) in the brain of mice lacking the 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor was scarce and confined to the septum, globus pallidus, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, cortex, and substantia nigra. The low densities of [(3)H]5-CT binding sites detected in septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and cortex were displaced by 10 microM of the selective 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist (R)-3-(2-(2-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl) ethyl)pyrrolidine-1-sulfonyl) phenol (SB-269970). The SB-269970-insensitive [(3)H]5-CT binding sites detected in globus pallidus and substantia nigra of 5-HT(1A/1B) knockout mice were displaced by N-[3-(2-dimethylamino)ethoxy-4-methoxy-phenyl]-2'-methyl-4'- (5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4-carboxamide hydrochloride (SB-216641) (1 microM), demonstrating the 5-HT(1D) nature of these binding sites. In contrast to the low densities of [(3)H]5-CT binding sites, high-to-moderate densities of [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT binding sites (10 nM) were found throughout the brain of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1A/1B) knockout mice (olfactory system, septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, CA3 field of the hippocampus, cortical mantle, and central gray). These [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT binding sites were displaced by 10 microM SB-269970, risperidone, and methiothepin but not by pindolol, N-tert-butyl-3-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-phenylpropanamide (WAY- 100135), or citalopram. We conclude that despite its high affinity for the 5-HT(7) receptor in tissue homogenates, [(3)H]5-CT is not a good tracer for measuring 5-HT(7) receptor binding sites autoradiographically. Also, the lower affinity ligand [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT is a much better tracer for autoradiographic studies at the 5-HT(7) receptor binding sites.",

        "Abstract": "To test for the contribution of the 5-HT(1B) receptor subtype in mediating the effects of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), we used intracerebral in vivo microdialysis in awake, freely moving 5-HT(1B) receptor knock-out mice. We show that a single systemic administration of fluoxetine (1, 5 or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) increased extracellular serotonin levels [5-HT](ext) in the ventral hippocampus and frontal cortex of wild-type and mutant mice. However, in the ventral hippocampus, fluoxetine, at the three doses studied, induced a larger increase in [5-HT](ext) in knock-out than in wild-type mice. In the frontal cortex, the effect of fluoxetine did not differ between the two genotypes. The region-dependent response to fluoxetine described here in mutants confirms data we recently reported for another SSRI, paroxetine. These data suggest that 5-HT(1B) autoreceptors limit the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on dialysate 5-HT levels at serotonergic nerve terminals located mainly in the ventral hippocampus. Alternative mechanisms, e.g., changes in 5-HT transporter and/or 5-HT(1A) receptor density in 5-HT(1B) receptor knock-out mice could also explain these findings.",

        "Title": "Involvement of 5-HT1A receptors in homeostatic and stress-induced adaptive regulations of paradoxical sleep: studies in 5-HT1A knock-out mice.",
        "Abstract": "For the last two decades, the involvement of 5-HT(1A) receptors in the regulation of vigilance states has been studied extensively thanks to pharmacological tools, but clear-cut conclusion has not been reached yet. By studying mutant mice that do not express this receptor type (5-HT(1A)-/-) and their wild-type 129/Sv counterparts, we herein demonstrate that 5-HT(1A) receptors play key roles in the control of spontaneous sleep-wakefulness cycles, as well as in homeostatic regulation and stress-induced adaptive changes of paradoxical sleep. Both strains of mice exhibited a diurnal sleep-wakefulness rhythm, but 5-HT(1A)-/- animals expressed higher amounts of paradoxical sleep than wild-type mice during both the light and the dark phases. In wild-type mice, pharmacological blockade of 5-HT(1A) receptors by WAY 100635 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) promoted paradoxical sleep, whereas the 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.25-1 mg/kg, s.c.) had an opposite effect. In contrast, none of the 5-HT(1A) receptor ligands affected sleep significantly in 5-HT(1A)-/- mice. However, 5-HT(1B) receptor stimulation by CP 94253 (1-3 mg/kg, i.p.) induced a reduction in paradoxical sleep in both strains, this effect being more pronounced in 5-HT(1A)-/- mutants. Finally, in contrast to wild-type mice, 5-HT(1A)-/- mutants did not exhibit any rebound of paradoxical sleep after either a 9 hr instrumental paradoxical sleep deprivation or a 90 min immobilization stress. Altogether, these data indicate that, in the mouse, 5-HT(1A) receptors participate in the spontaneous and homeostatic regulation, as well as in stress-induced adaptive changes of paradoxical sleep.",

        "Abstract": "The distribution and function of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT(2A)) receptor were investigated in the intestines of wild-type (5-HT(2A) +/+) and knockout (5-HT(2A) -/-) mice. In 5-HT(2A) +/+ mice, rats, and guinea pigs, 5-HT(2A) receptor immunoreactivity was found on circular and longitudinal smooth muscle cells, neurons, enterocytes, and Paneth cells. Muscular 5-HT(2A) receptors were concentrated in caveolae; neuronal 5-HT(2A) receptors were found intracellularly and on the plasma membranes of nerve cell bodies and axons. Neuronal 5-HT(2A) immunoreactivity was detected as early as E14 in ganglia, intravillus nerves, and the deep muscle plexus. The 5-HT(2A) -/- colon did not express 5-HT(2A) receptors and did not contract in response to exogenous 5-HT. 5-HT(2A) -/- enterocytes were smaller, Paneth cells fewer, and muscle layers thinner (and showed degeneration) compared with those of 5-HT(2A) +/+ littermates. The 5-HT(2A) receptor may thus be required for the maintenance and/or development of enteric neuroeffectors and other enteric functions, although gastrointestinal and colonic transit times in 5-HT(2A) -/- and +/+ mice did not differ significantly.",

        "Abstract": "Serotonin is implicated in mood regulation, and drugs acting via the serotonergic system are effective in treating anxiety and depression. Specifically, agonists of the serotonin1A receptor have anxiolytic properties, and knockout mice lacking this receptor show increased anxiety-like behaviour. Here we use a tissue-specific, conditional rescue strategy to show that expression of the serotonin1A receptor primarily in the hippocampus and cortex, but not in the raphe nuclei, is sufficient to rescue the behavioural phenotype of the knockout mice. Furthermore, using the conditional nature of these transgenic mice, we suggest that receptor expression during the early postnatal period, but not in the adult, is necessary for this behavioural rescue. These findings show that postnatal developmental processes help to establish adult anxiety-like behaviour. In addition, the normal role of the serotonin1A receptor during development may be different from its function when this receptor is activated by therapeutic intervention in adulthood.",

        "Abstract": "Two presynaptic receptors play an important role in the regulation of serotonergic neurotransmission, i.e., the 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) receptor. The present study focuses on putative adaptive changes in the 5-HT(1A) receptor system in mice that lack 5-HT(1B) receptors (5-HT(1B) KO). 5-HT(1A) receptor sensitivity was assessed in vivo in two models of presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptor activity: agonist-induced hypothermia and prevention of stress-induced hyperthermia. The effects of 5-HT(1A) receptor activation by flesinoxan (0.1-3.0 mg/kg s.c.) were determined telemetrically on body temperature and heart rate in 5-HT(1B) KO and wild-type (WT) mice. Flesinoxan induced hypothermia dose-dependently without affecting heart rate and prevented stress-induced hyperthermia and tachycardia equipotently in both genotypes. Specificity of these responses was confirmed by blockade with the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY100635 (1.0 mg/kg s.c.). The importance of continuous sampling in freely moving subjects to improve appropriate characterization of mutants is discussed. 5-HT(1B) KO mice showed no shift in 5-HT(1A) receptor sensitivity compared to WT mice. This study found no indications for adaptive changes in presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptor function in 5-HT(1B) KO mice as measured telemetrically on body temperature and heart rate responses.",

        "Title": "Modification of serotonin neuron properties in mice lacking 5-HT1A receptors.",
        "Abstract": "Using null mutant mice for the 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1A-/-), extracellular electrophysiological recordings were first conducted to evaluate the impact of its genetic deletion on the firing rate of dorsal raphe 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons. Experiments were also done using brain slices to assess whether any compensation phenomenon had taken place in key receptors known to control 5-HT and norepinephrine release. The mean firing rate of 5-HT neurons was nearly doubled in 5-HT1A-/- mice, although 65% of the neurons were firing in their normal range. In preloaded brain slices, the 5-HT1D/B receptor agonist sumatriptan equally inhibited the electrically evoked release of [3H]5-HT in mesencephalic slices (containing the dorsal and median raphe) from wildtype and 5-HT1A-/- mice. The 5-HT1B receptor agonist CP 93129 (1,4-dihydro-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-5H-pyrrol (3, 2-b) pyridin-5-one) and the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist UK14,304 (5-bromo-N-(4, 5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-6-quinoxalinamine) produced the same inhibitory effect in both groups of mice in hippocampus and frontal cortex slices. No difference was observed on the UK14,304-mediated inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine from preloaded slices of the two latter structures between the two groups of mice. In conclusion, the loss of control of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor in 5-HT1A-/- mice lead to a significant enhancement of 5-HT neuronal firing, but it did not alter 5-HT or norepinephrine release in any of the brain structures examined. In addition, it was not associated with changes in the function of 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B autoreceptors and of alpha2-adrenergic heteroreceptors on 5-HT neurons, nor of that of alpha2-adrenoceptors on norepinephrine terminals.",

        "Abstract": "Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a neurotransmitter involved in a number of physiological functions including sleep, appetite, pain perception, and sexual activity. Several pathological states such as migraine, depression, and anxiety have been linked to the serotonergic system, and serotonergic drugs have been used to treat these disorders. To date, there are 14 known serotonin receptor subtypes through which serotonin exerts its multiple actions. The classic pharmacological approach to study how these individual receptor subtypes contribute to various behaviours has been to use selective drugs that either block or activate certain receptor subtypes, and then study the effects of these compounds on physiology and behaviour. A complementary genetic approach is the technique of gene targeting. Using this technology, we and others have begun to examine the contribution of several serotonin receptor subtypes to complex behaviours through the generation of knockout mice that lack the genes encoding these receptors. In this review, we will describe what we have learned about the serotonergic system and the function of the 5-HT(1B) receptor by the analysis of 5-HT(1B) receptor knockout mice. Furthermore, we will discuss the implications of these findings and our plans for future studies.",
