        "Abstract": "Transposase genes are ubiquitous in all domains of life and provide a rich reservoir for the evolution of novel protein functions. Here we report deep evolutionary links between bacterial IS110 transposases, which catalyze RNA-guided DNA recombination using bridge RNAs, and archaeal/eukaryotic Nop5-family proteins, which promote RNA-guided RNA 2'-O-methylation using C/D-box snoRNAs. Based on conservation in the protein primary sequence, domain architecture, and three-dimensional structure, as well as common architectural features of the non-coding RNA components, we propose that programmable RNA modification emerged via exaptation of components derived from IS110-like transposons. Alongside recent studies highlighting the origins of CRISPR-Cas9 and Cas12 in IS605-family transposons, these findings underscore how recurrent domestication events of transposable elements gave rise to complex RNA-guided biological mechanisms.",

Unbiased profiling of RT-associated RNA and DNA ligands in DRT2-expressing cells revealed that reverse transcription generates concatenated cDNA repeats through programmed template jumping on the ncRNA.

These transposons encode efficient, CRISPR RNA-guided transposases that execute genomic insertions in Escherichia coli at efficiencies approaching ~100%. Moreover, they generate multiplexed edits when programmed with multiple guides, and function robustly in diverse Gram-negative bacterial species. Here we present a detailed protocol for engineering bacterial genomes using CRISPR-associated transposase (CAST) systems, including guidelines on the available vectors, customization of guide RNAs and DNA payloads, selection of common delivery methods, and genotypic analysis of integration events. We further describe a computational CRISPR RNA design algorithm to avoid potential off-targets, and a CRISPR array cloning pipeline for performing multiplexed DNA insertions. The method presented here allows the isolation of clonal strains containing a novel genomic integration event of interest within 1-2 weeks using available plasmid constructs and standard molecular biology techniques.",

IS605family TnpB homologs function in bacteria as programmable homing endonucleases by exploiting transposon-encoded guide RNAs to cleave vacant genomic sites, thereby driving transposon maintenance through DSB-stimulated homologous recombination. Whether this pathway is conserved in other genetic contexts, and in association with other transposases, is unknown. Here we uncover molecular mechanisms of transposition and RNA-guided DNA cleavage by IS607-family elements that, remarkably, also encode catalytic, self-splicing group I introns.

Type V-K CASTs offer potential technology advantages but lack accuracy, and the molecular basis for this drawback has remained elusive. Here, we reveal that type V-K CASTs maintain an RNA-independent, \"untargeted\" transposition pathway alongside RNA-dependent integration, driven by the local availability of TnsC filaments. Using cryo-electron microscopy, single-molecule experiments, and high-throughput sequencing, we found that a minimal, CRISPR-less transpososome preferentially directs untargeted integration at AT-rich sites, with additional local specificity imparted by TnsB. By exploiting this knowledge, we suppressed untargeted transposition and increased type V-K CAST specificity up to 98.1% in cells without compromising on-target integration efficiency. These findings will inform further engineering of CAST systems for accurate, kilobase-scale genome engineering applications.",

        "Abstract": "Unlike canonical CRISPR-Cas systems that rely on RNA-guided nucleases for target cleavage, CRISPR-associated transposases (CASTs) repurpose nuclease-deficient CRISPR effectors to facilitate RNA-guided transposition of large genetic payloads. Type V-K CASTs offer several potential upsides for genome engineering, due to their compact size, easy programmability, and unidirectional integration. However, these systems are substantially less accurate than type I-F CASTs, and the molecular basis for this difference has remained elusive. Here we reveal that type V-K CASTs undergo two distinct mobilization pathways with remarkably different specificities: RNA-dependent and RNA-independent transposition. Whereas RNA-dependent transposition relies on Cas12k for accurate target selection, RNA-independent integration events are untargeted and primarily driven by the local availability of TnsC filaments. The cryo-EM structure of the untargeted complex reveals a TnsB-TnsC-TniQ transpososome that encompasses two turns of a TnsC filament and otherwise resembles major architectural aspects of the Cas12k-containing transpososome. Using single-molecule experiments and genome-wide meta-analyses, we found that AT-rich sites are preferred substrates for untargeted transposition and that the TnsB transposase also imparts local specificity, which collectively determine the precise insertion site. Knowledge of these motifs allowed us to direct untargeted transposition events to specific hotspot regions of a plasmid. Finally, by exploiting TnsB's preference for on-target integration and modulating the availability of TnsC, we suppressed RNA-independent transposition events and increased type V-K CAST specificity up to 98.1%, without compromising the efficiency of on-target integration. Collectively, our results reveal the importance of dissecting target site selection mechanisms and highlight new opportunities to leverage CAST systems for accurate, kilobase-scale genome engineering applications.",

        "Abstract": "CRISPR-associated transposases\u00a0(CASTs) direct DNA integration downstream of target sites using the RNA-guided DNA binding activity of nuclease-deficient CRISPR-Cas systems. Transposition relies on several key protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, but little is known about the explicit sequence requirements governing efficient transposon DNA integration activity. Here, we exploit pooled library screening and high-throughput sequencing to reveal novel sequence determinants during transposition by the Type I-F Vibrio cholerae CAST system\u00a0(VchCAST). On the donor DNA, large transposon end libraries revealed binding site nucleotide preferences for the TnsB transposase, as well as an additional conserved region that encoded a consensus binding site for integration host factor (IHF). Remarkably, we found that VchCAST requires IHF for efficient transposition, thus revealing a novel cellular factor involved in CRISPR-associated transpososome assembly. On the target DNA, we uncovered preferred sequence motifs at the integration site that explained previously observed heterogeneity with single-base pair resolution. Finally, we exploited our library data to design modified transposon variants that enable in-frame protein tagging. Collectively, our results provide new clues about the assembly and architecture of the paired-end complex formed between TnsB and the transposon DNA, and inform the design of custom payload sequences for genome engineering applications with CAST systems.",

Here we develop a system in human cells for programmable, DSB-free DNA integration using Type I CRISPR-associated transposons (CASTs).

        "Abstract": "Canonical CRISPR-Cas systems utilize RNA-guided nucleases for targeted cleavage of foreign nucleic acids, whereas some nuclease-deficient CRISPR-Cas complexes have been repurposed to direct the insertion of Tn7-like transposons. Here, we established a bioinformatic and experimental pipeline to comprehensively explore the diversity of Type I-F CRISPR-associated transposons. We report DNA integration for 20 systems and identify a highly active subset that exhibits complete orthogonality in transposon DNA mobilization. We reveal the modular nature of CRISPR-associated transposons by exploring the horizontal acquisition of targeting modules and by characterizing a system that encodes both a programmable, RNA-dependent pathway, and a fixed, RNA-independent pathway. Finally, we analyzed transposon-encoded cargo genes and found the striking presence of anti-phage defense systems, suggesting a role in transmitting innate immunity between bacteria. Collectively, this study substantially advances our biological understanding of CRISPR-associated transposon function and expands the suite of RNA-guided transposases for programmable, large-scale genome engineering.",

        "Abstract": "Bacterial transposons propagate through either non-replicative (cut-and-paste) or replicative (copy-and-paste) pathways, depending on how the mobile element is excised from its donor source. In the well-characterized E. coli transposon Tn7, a heteromeric TnsA-TnsB transposase directs cut-and-paste transposition by cleaving both strands at each transposon end during the excision step. Whether a similar pathway is involved for RNA-guided transposons, in which CRISPR-Cas systems confer DNA target specificity, has not been determined. Here, we apply long-read, population-based whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to unambiguously resolve transposition products for two evolutionarily distinct transposon types that employ either Cascade or Cas12k for RNA-guided DNA integration. Our results show that RNA-guided transposon systems lacking functional TnsA primarily undergo copy-and-paste transposition, generating cointegrate products that comprise duplicated transposon copies and genomic\u00a0insertion of the vector backbone. Finally, we report natural and engineered transposon variants encoding a TnsAB fusion protein, revealing a novel strategy for achieving RNA-guided transposition with fewer molecular components.",

        "Abstract": "Existing technologies for site-specific integration of kilobase-sized DNA sequences in bacteria are limited by low efficiency, a reliance on recombination, the need for multiple vectors, and challenges in multiplexing. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a substantially improved version of our previously reported Tn7-like transposon from Vibrio cholerae, which uses a Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system for programmable, RNA-guided transposition. The optimized insertion of transposable elements by guide RNA-assisted targeting (INTEGRATE) system achieves highly accurate and marker-free DNA integration of up to 10 kilobases at ~100% efficiency in bacteria. Using multi-spacer CRISPR arrays, we achieved simultaneous multiplexed insertions in three genomic loci and facile, multi-loci deletions by combining orthogonal integrases and recombinases. Finally, we demonstrated robust function in biomedically and industrially relevant bacteria and achieved target- and species-specific integration in a complex bacterial community. This work establishes INTEGRATE as a versatile tool for multiplexed, kilobase-scale genome engineering.",

        "Abstract": "Conventional CRISPR-Cas systems maintain genomic integrity by leveraging guide RNAs for the nuclease-dependent degradation of mobile genetic elements, including plasmids and viruses. Here we describe a notable inversion of this paradigm, in which bacterial Tn7-like transposons have co-opted nuclease-deficient CRISPR-Cas systems to catalyse RNA-guided integration of mobile genetic elements into the genome. Programmable transposition of Vibrio cholerae Tn6677 in Escherichia coli requires CRISPR- and transposon-associated molecular machineries, including a co-complex between the DNA-targeting complex Cascade and the transposition protein TniQ. Integration of donor DNA occurs in one of two possible orientations at a fixed distance downstream of target DNA sequences, and can accommodate variable length genetic payloads. Deep-sequencing experiments reveal highly specific, genome-wide DNA insertion across dozens of unique target sites. This discovery\u00a0of a fully programmable, RNA-guided integrase lays the foundation for genomic manipulations that obviate the requirements for double-strand breaks and homology-directed repair.",

        "Abstract": "The famed physicist-turned-biologist, Max Delbr\u00fcck, once remarked that, for physicists, \"the field of bacterial viruses is a fine playground for serious children who ask ambitious questions.\" Early discoveries in that playground helped establish molecular genetics, and half a century later, biologists delving into the same field have ushered in the era of precision genome engineering. The focus has of course shifted-from bacterial viruses and their mechanisms of infection to the bacterial hosts and their mechanisms of immunity-but it is the very same evolutionary arms race that continues to awe and inspire researchers worldwide. In this review, we explore the remarkable diversity of CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems, describe the molecular components that mediate nucleic acid targeting, and outline the use of these RNA-guided machines for biotechnology applications. CRISPR-Cas research has yielded far more than just Cas9-based genome-editing tools, and the wide-reaching, innovative impacts of this fascinating biological playground are sure to be felt for years to come.",

        "Abstract": "The RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) has been widely repurposed for genome editing. High-fidelity (SpCas9-HF1) and enhanced specificity (eSpCas9(1.1)) variants exhibit substantially reduced off-target cleavage in human cells, but the mechanism of target discrimination and the potential to further improve fidelity are unknown. Here, using single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer experiments, we show that both SpCas9-HF1 and eSpCas9(1.1) are trapped in an inactive state when bound to mismatched targets. We find that a non-catalytic domain within Cas9, REC3, recognizes target complementarity and governs the HNH nuclease to regulate overall catalytic competence. Exploiting this observation, we design a new hyper-accurate Cas9 variant (HypaCas9) that demonstrates high genome-wide specificity without compromising on-target activity in human cells. These results offer a more comprehensive model to rationalize and modify the balance between target recognition and nuclease activation for precision genome editing.",

        "Abstract": "The bacterial adaptive immune system CRISPR-Cas9 has been appropriated as a versatile tool for editing genomes, controlling gene expression, and visualizing genetic loci. To analyze Cas9's ability to bind DNA rapidly and specifically, we generated multiple libraries of potential binding partners for measuring the kinetics of nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9) interactions. Using a massively parallel method to quantify protein-DNA interactions on a high-throughput sequencing flow cell, we comprehensively assess the effects of combinatorial mismatches between guide RNA (gRNA) and target nucleotides, both in the seed and in more distal nucleotides, plus disruption of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). We report two consequences of PAM-distal mismatches: reversal of dCas9 binding at long time scales, and synergistic changes in association kinetics when other gRNA-target mismatches are present. Together, these observations support a model for Cas9 specificity wherein gRNA-DNA mismatches at PAM-distal bases modulate different biophysical parameters that determine association and dissociation rates. The methods we present decouple aspects of kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the Cas9-DNA interaction and broaden the toolkit for investigating off-target binding behavior.",

        "Abstract": "Binding specificity of Cas9-guide RNA complexes to DNA is important for genome-engineering applications; however, how mismatches influence target recognition/rejection kinetics is not well understood. Here we used single-molecule FRET to probe real-time interactions between Cas9-RNA and DNA targets. The bimolecular association rate is only weakly dependent on sequence; however, the dissociation rate greatly increases from <0.006\u2009s(-1) to >2\u2009s(-1) upon introduction of mismatches proximal to protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM), demonstrating that mismatches encountered early during heteroduplex formation induce rapid rejection of off-target DNA. In contrast, PAM-distal mismatches up to 11 base pairs in length, which prevent DNA cleavage, still allow formation of a stable complex (dissociation rate <0.006\u2009s(-1)), suggesting that extremely slow rejection could sequester Cas9-RNA, increasing the Cas9 expression level necessary for genome-editing, thereby aggravating off-target effects. We also observed at least two different bound FRET states that may represent distinct steps in target search and proofreading.",

The system preserves memories of prior infections by integrating short segments of foreign DNA, termed spacers, into the CRISPR array in a process termed adaptation. During the past 3 years, significant progress has been made on the genetic requirements and molecular mechanisms of adaptation. Here we review these recent advances, with a focus on the experimental approaches that have been developed, the insights they generated, and a proposed mechanism for self- versus non-self-discrimination during the process of spacer selection. We further describe the regulation of adaptation and the protein players involved in this fascinating process that allows bacteria and archaea to harbor adaptive immunity.",

        "Abstract": "Cas9 is an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease that targets foreign DNA for destruction as part of a bacterial adaptive immune system mediated by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). Together with single-guide RNAs, Cas9 also functions as a powerful genome engineering tool in plants and animals, and efforts are underway to increase the efficiency and specificity of DNA targeting for potential therapeutic applications. Studies of off-target effects have shown that DNA binding is far more promiscuous than DNA cleavage, yet the molecular cues that govern strand scission have not been elucidated. Here we show that the conformational state of the HNH nuclease domain directly controls DNA cleavage activity. Using intramolecular F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer experiments to detect relative orientations of the Cas9 catalytic domains when associated with on- and off-target DNA, we find that DNA cleavage efficiencies scale with the extent to which the HNH domain samples an activated conformation. We furthermore uncover a surprising mode of allosteric communication that ensures concerted firing of both Cas9 nuclease domains. Our results highlight a proofreading mechanism beyond initial protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) recognition and RNA-DNA base-pairing that serves as a final specificity checkpoint before DNA double-strand break formation.",

In Escherichia coli, Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense) is an RNA-guided surveillance complex that binds foreign DNA and recruits Cas3, a trans-acting nuclease helicase for target degradation. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to visualize Cascade and Cas3 binding to foreign DNA targets. Our analysis reveals two distinct pathways dictated by the presence or absence of a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). Binding to a protospacer flanked by a PAM recruits a nuclease-active Cas3 for degradation of short single-stranded regions of target DNA, whereas PAM mutations elicit an alternative pathway that recruits a nuclease-inactive Cas3 through a mechanism that is dependent on the Cas1 and Cas2 proteins. These findings explain how target recognition by Cascade can elicit distinct outcomes and support a model for acquisition of new spacer sequences through a mechanism involving processive, ATP-dependent Cas3 translocation along foreign DNA.",

Structures of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 alone or bound to single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and target DNA revealed a bilobed protein architecture that undergoes major conformational changes upon guide RNA and DNA binding. To investigate the molecular determinants and relevance of the interlobe rearrangement for target recognition and cleavage, we designed a split-Cas9 enzyme in which the nuclease lobe and \u03b1-helical lobe are expressed as separate polypeptides. Although the lobes do not interact on their own, the sgRNA recruits them into a ternary complex that recapitulates the activity of full-length Cas9 and catalyzes site-specific DNA cleavage. The use of a modified sgRNA abrogates split-Cas9 activity by preventing dimerization, allowing for the development of an inducible dimerization system. We propose that split-Cas9 can act as a highly regulatable platform for genome-engineering applications.",

        "Title": "Programmable RNA recognition and cleavage by CRISPR/Cas9.",
        "Abstract": "The CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 is an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease that uses RNA-DNA complementarity to identify target sites for sequence-specific double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cleavage. In its native context, Cas9 acts on DNA substrates exclusively because both binding and catalysis require recognition of a short DNA sequence, known as the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), next to and on the strand opposite the twenty-nucleotide target site in dsDNA. Cas9 has proven to be a versatile tool for genome engineering and gene regulation in a large range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell types, and in whole organisms, but it has been thought to be incapable of targeting RNA. Here we show that Cas9 binds with high affinity to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) targets matching the Cas9-associated guide RNA sequence when the PAM is presented in trans as a separate DNA oligonucleotide. Furthermore, PAM-presenting oligonucleotides (PAMmers) stimulate site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage of ssRNA targets, similar to PAM-mediated stimulation of Cas9-catalysed DNA cleavage. Using specially designed PAMmers, Cas9 can be specifically directed to bind or cut RNA targets while avoiding corresponding DNA sequences, and we demonstrate that this strategy enables the isolation of a specific endogenous messenger RNA from cells. These results reveal a fundamental connection between PAM binding and substrate selection by Cas9, and highlight the utility of Cas9 for programmable transcript recognition without the need for tags.",

        "Title": "CasA mediates Cas3-catalyzed target degradation during CRISPR RNA-guided interference.",
        "Abstract": "In bacteria, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) DNA-targeting complex Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense) uses CRISPR RNA (crRNA) guides to bind complementary DNA targets at sites adjacent to a trinucleotide signature sequence called the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). The Cascade complex then recruits Cas3, a nuclease-helicase that catalyzes unwinding and cleavage of foreign double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bearing a sequence matching that of the crRNA. Cascade comprises the CasA-E proteins and one crRNA, forming a structure that binds and unwinds dsDNA to form an R loop in which the target strand of the DNA base pairs with the 32-nt RNA guide sequence. Single-particle electron microscopy reconstructions of dsDNA-bound Cascade with and without Cas3 reveal that Cascade positions the PAM-proximal end of the DNA duplex at the CasA subunit and near the site of Cas3 association. The finding that the DNA target and Cas3 colocalize with CasA implicates this subunit in a key target-validation step during DNA interference. We show biochemically that base pairing of the PAM region is unnecessary for target binding but critical for Cas3-mediated degradation. In addition, the L1 loop of CasA, previously implicated in PAM recognition, is essential for Cas3 activation following target binding by Cascade. Together, these data show that the CasA subunit of Cascade functions as an essential partner of Cas3 by recognizing DNA target sites and positioning Cas3 adjacent to the PAM to ensure cleavage.",

Cas9 has been harnessed as a powerful tool for genome editing and gene regulation in many eukaryotic organisms. We report 2.6 and 2.2 angstrom resolution crystal structures of two major Cas9 enzyme subtypes, revealing the structural core shared by all Cas9 family members. The architectures of Cas9 enzymes define nucleic acid binding clefts, and single-particle electron microscopy reconstructions show that the two structural lobes harboring these clefts undergo guide RNA-induced reorientation to form a central channel where DNA substrates are bound. The observation that extensive structural rearrangements occur before target DNA duplex binding implicates guide RNA loading as a key step in Cas9 activation.",

        "Abstract": "The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated enzyme Cas9 is an RNA-guided endonuclease that uses RNA-DNA base-pairing to target foreign DNA in bacteria. Cas9-guide RNA complexes are also effective genome engineering agents in animals and plants. Here we use single-molecule and bulk biochemical experiments to determine how Cas9-RNA interrogates DNA to find specific cleavage sites. We show that both binding and cleavage of DNA by Cas9-RNA require recognition of a short trinucleotide protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Non-target DNA binding affinity scales with PAM density, and sequences fully complementary to the guide RNA but lacking a nearby PAM are ignored by Cas9-RNA. Competition assays provide evidence that DNA strand separation and RNA-DNA heteroduplex formation initiate at the PAM and proceed directionally towards the distal end of the target sequence. Furthermore, PAM interactions trigger Cas9 catalytic activity. These results reveal how Cas9 uses PAM recognition to quickly identify potential target sites while scanning large DNA molecules, and to regulate scission of double-stranded DNA.",

        "Abstract": "CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems protect prokaryotes against foreign genetic elements. crRNAs derived from CRISPR loci base pair with complementary nucleic acids, leading to their destruction. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, crRNA biogenesis requires the endoribonuclease Csy4, which binds and cleaves the repetitive sequence of the CRISPR transcript. Biochemical assays and three co-crystal structures of wild-type and mutant Csy4/RNA complexes reveal a substrate positioning and cleavage mechanism in which a histidine deprotonates the ribosyl 2'-hydroxyl pinned in place by a serine, leading to nucleophilic attack on the scissile phosphate. The active site catalytic dyad lacks a general acid to protonate the leaving group and positively charged residues to stabilize the transition state, explaining why the observed catalytic rate constant is \u223c10(4)-fold slower than that of RNase A. We show that this RNA cleavage step is essential for assembly of the Csy protein-crRNA complex that facilitates target recognition. Considering that Csy4 recognizes a single cellular substrate and sequesters the cleavage product, evolutionary pressure has likely selected for substrate specificity and high-affinity crRNA interactions at the expense of rapid cleavage kinetics.",

        "Abstract": "Bacteria and archaea possess adaptive immune systems that rely on small RNAs for defense against invasive genetic elements. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) genomic loci are transcribed as long precursor RNAs, which must be enzymatically cleaved to generate mature CRISPR-derived RNAs (crRNAs) that serve as guides for foreign nucleic acid targeting and degradation. This processing occurs within the repetitive sequence and is catalyzed by a dedicated Cas6 family member in many CRISPR systems. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, crRNA biogenesis requires the endoribonuclease Csy4 (Cas6f), which binds and cleaves at the 3' side of a stable RNA stem-loop structure encoded by the CRISPR repeat. We show here that Csy4 recognizes its RNA substrate with an ~50 pM equilibrium dissociation constant, making it one of the highest-affinity protein:RNA interactions of this size reported to date. Tight binding is mediated exclusively by interactions upstream of the scissile phosphate that allow Csy4 to remain bound to its product and thereby sequester the crRNA for downstream targeting. Substrate specificity is achieved by RNA major groove contacts that are highly sensitive to helical geometry, as well as a strict preference for guanosine adjacent to the scissile phosphate in the active site. Collectively, our data highlight diverse modes of substrate recognition employed by Csy4 to enable accurate selection of CRISPR transcripts while avoiding spurious, off-target RNA binding and cleavage.",

        "Abstract": "The specialized ribonuclease Dicer plays a central role in eukaryotic gene expression by producing small regulatory RNAs-microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs)-from larger double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrates. Although Dicer will cleave both imperfectly base-paired hairpin structures (pre-miRNAs) and perfect duplexes (pre-siRNAs) in vitro, it has not been clear whether these are mechanistically equivalent substrates and how dsRNA binding proteins such as trans-activation response (TAR) RNA binding protein (TRBP) influence substrate selection and RNA processing efficiency. We show here that human Dicer is much faster at processing a pre-miRNA substrate compared to a pre-siRNA substrate under both single and multiple turnover conditions. Maximal cleavage rates (V(max)) calculated by Michaelis-Menten analysis differed by more than 100-fold under multiple turnover conditions. TRBP was found to enhance dicing of both substrates to similar extents, and this stimulation required the two N-terminal dsRNA binding domains of TRBP. These results demonstrate that multiple factors influence dicing kinetics. While TRBP stimulates dicing by enhancing the stability of Dicer-substrate complexes, Dicer itself generates product RNAs at rates determined at least in part by the structural properties of the substrate.",

        "Title": "Translation factors direct intrinsic ribosome dynamics during translation termination and ribosome recycling.",
        "Abstract": "Characterizing the structural dynamics of the translating ribosome remains a major goal in the study of protein synthesis. Deacylation of peptidyl-tRNA during translation elongation triggers fluctuations of the pretranslocation ribosomal complex between two global conformational states. Elongation factor G-mediated control of the resulting dynamic conformational equilibrium helps to coordinate ribosome and tRNA movements during elongation and is thus a crucial mechanistic feature of translation. Beyond elongation, deacylation of peptidyl-tRNA also occurs during translation termination, and this deacylated tRNA persists during ribosome recycling. Here we report that specific regulation of the analogous conformational equilibrium by translation release and ribosome recycling factors has a critical role in the termination and recycling mechanisms. Our results support the view that specific regulation of the global state of the ribosome is a fundamental characteristic of all translation factors and a unifying theme throughout protein synthesis.",
