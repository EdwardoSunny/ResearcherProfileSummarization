        "Title": "Discovery of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral synergy between remdesivir and approved drugs in human lung cells.",
        "Abstract": "SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an ongoing global pandemic with significant mortality and morbidity. At this time, the only FDA-approved therapeutic for COVID-19 is remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleoside analog. Efficacy is only moderate, and improved treatment strategies are urgently needed. To accomplish this goal, we devised a strategy to identify compounds that act synergistically with remdesivir in preventing SARS-CoV-2 replication. We conducted combinatorial high-throughput screening in the presence of submaximal remdesivir concentrations, using a human lung epithelial cell line infected with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. This identified 20 approved drugs that act synergistically with remdesivir, many with favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. Strongest effects were observed with established antivirals, Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A (HCV NS5A) inhibitors velpatasvir and elbasvir. Combination with their partner drugs sofosbuvir and grazoprevir further increased efficacy, increasing remdesivir's apparent potency\u2009>\u200925-fold. We report that HCV NS5A inhibitors act on the SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease proofreader, providing a possible explanation for the synergy observed with nucleoside analog remdesivir. FDA-approved Hepatitis C therapeutics Epclusa\u00ae (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Zepatier\u00ae (elbasvir/grazoprevir) could be further optimized to achieve potency and pharmacokinetic properties that support clinical evaluation\u00a0in combination with\u00a0remdesivir.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the fast development of vaccines, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still circulating and generating variants of concern (VoC) that escape the humoral immune response. In this context, the search for anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds is still essential. A class of natural polyphenols known as flavonoids, frequently available in fruits and vegetables, is widely explored in the treatment of different diseases and used as a scaffold for the design of novel drugs. Therefore, herein we evaluate seven flavonoids divided into three subclasses, isoflavone (genistein), flavone (apigenin and luteolin) and flavonol (fisetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and quercetin), for COVID-19 treatment using cell-based assays and in silico calculations validated with experimental enzymatic data. The flavonols were better SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors than isoflavone and flavones. The increasing number of hydroxyl groups in ring B of the flavonols kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin decreased the 50% effective concentration (EC",

        "Abstract": "With the recent global spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, there remains an urgent need to develop effective and variant-resistant oral drugs. Recently, we reported in vitro results validating the use of combination drugs targeting both the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and proofreading exonuclease (ExoN) as potential COVID-19 therapeutics. For the nucleotide analogues to be efficient SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, two properties are required: efficient incorporation by RdRp and substantial resistance to excision by ExoN. Here, we have selected and evaluated nucleotide analogues with a variety of structural features for resistance to ExoN removal when they are attached at the 3' RNA terminus. We found that dideoxynucleotides and other nucleotides lacking both 2'- and 3'-OH groups were most resistant to ExoN excision, whereas those possessing both 2'- and 3'-OH groups were efficiently removed. We also found that the 3'-OH group in the nucleotide analogues was more critical than the 2'-OH for excision by ExoN. Since the functionally important sequences in Nsp14/10 are highly conserved among all SARS-CoV-2 variants, these identified structural features of nucleotide analogues offer invaluable insights for designing effective RdRp inhibitors that can be simultaneously efficiently incorporated by the RdRp and substantially resist ExoN excision. Such newly developed RdRp terminators would be good candidates to evaluate their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture and animal models, perhaps combined with additional exonuclease inhibitors to increase their overall effectiveness.",

In the presence of Pibrentasvir, RNAs terminated with the active forms of the prodrugs Sofosbuvir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir and AT-527 were largely protected from excision by the exonuclease, while in the absence of Pibrentasvir, there was rapid excision. Due to its unique structure, Tenofovir-terminated RNA was highly resistant to exonuclease excision even in the absence of Pibrentasvir. Viral cell culture studies also demonstrate significant synergy using this combination strategy. This study supports the use of combination drugs that inhibit both the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase and exonuclease for effective COVID-19 treatment.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, has caused a global public health emergency. Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Here, using model polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrate that the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Using the same molecular insight, we selected 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate, which are the active forms of two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA-approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two of these HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp where they also terminate further polymerase extension. Given the 98% amino acid similarity of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. These results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus agents.",

After examining the molecular structures and activities of hepatitis C viral inhibitors and comparing hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, we previously postulated that the FDA-approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) might inhibit SARS-CoV-2. We subsequently demonstrated that Sofosbuvir triphosphate is incorporated by the relatively low fidelity SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), serving as an immediate polymerase reaction terminator, but not by a host-like high fidelity DNA polymerase. Other investigators have since demonstrated the ability of Sofosbuvir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and brain cells; additionally, COVID-19 clinical trials with EPCLUSA and with Sofosbuvir plus Daclatasvir have been initiated in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader to maintain the viral genome integrity. Any effective antiviral targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp must display a certain level of resistance to this proofreading activity. We report here that Sofosbuvir terminated RNA resists removal by the exonuclease to a substantially higher extent than RNA terminated by Remdesivir, another drug being used as a COVID-19 therapeutic. These results offer a molecular basis supporting the current use of Sofosbuvir in combination with other drugs in COVID-19 clinical trials.",

Using the molecular insight gained from the previous studies, we selected the active triphosphate forms of six other antiviral agents, Alovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide, AZT, Abacavir, Lamivudine, and Emtricitabine, for evaluation as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and demonstrated the ability of these viral polymerase inhibitors to be incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, where they terminate further polymerase extension with varying efficiency. These results provide a molecular basis for inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by these nucleotide analogues. If sufficient efficacy of some of these FDA-approved drugs in inhibiting viral replication in cell culture is established, they may be explored as potential COVID-19 therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, is responsible for the current COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. We previously demonstrated that five nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), including the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, Zidovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide and Emtricitabine. We report here the evaluation of a library of nucleoside triphosphate analogues with a variety of structural and chemical features as inhibitors of the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These features include modifications on the sugar (2' or 3' modifications, carbocyclic, acyclic, or dideoxynucleotides) or on the base. The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses' exonuclease activity. We examined these nucleotide analogues for their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and to prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (triphosphates of Carbovir, Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir; 3'-OMe-UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2'-OMe-UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2'-F-dUTP, 2'-NH",

Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously demonstrated that three nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).

Using the same molecular insight, we selected the active triphosphate forms of three other anti-viral agents, Alovudine, AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) and Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF, an FDA approved drug for HIV and hepatitis B) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We demonstrated the ability of these three viral polymerase inhibitors, 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate, 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate and Tenofovir diphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine, AZT and TAF, respectively) to be incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, where they also terminate further polymerase extension. These results offer a strong molecular basis for these nucleotide analogues to be evaluated as potential therapeutics for COVID-19.",

        "Abstract": "Epigenetic information is encoded in the mammalian genome in the form of cytosines methylated at the 5 position. Cytosine methylation has multiple biological effects, but our understanding of these effects has lagged because extant methods for mapping methylation sites genome-wide have severe shortcomings. For instance, the gold standard bisulfite sequencing approach suffers from the use of harsh reaction conditions resulting in DNA cleavage and incomplete conversion of unmethylated cytosine to uracil. We report here on a new photochemical method in which a DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase can be used to covalently attach reactive functionalities which upon irradiation at \u223c350 nm initiate photoinduced intramolecular reactions that convert modified C to T analogues. We synthesized a model compound, a cinnamyl ether-containing cytidine derivative, and demonstrated its conversion to a thymidine analogue using mild conditions and a DNA-compatible wavelength (\u223c350 nm), enabled by the use of a triplet sensitizer, thioxanthone. Transfer of a cinnamyl ether or comparable reactive functionality from an AdoMet analog to cytosine followed by the use of this photoconversion method would require only small amounts of DNA and allow complete methylation profiling on both long and short read sequencing platforms.",

        "Abstract": "To illuminate the extent and roles of exonic sequences in the splicing of human RNA transcripts, we conducted saturation mutagenesis of a 51-nt internal exon in a three-exon minigene. All possible single and tandem dinucleotide substitutions were surveyed. Using high-throughput genetics, 5560 minigene molecules were assayed for splicing in human HEK293 cells. Up to 70% of mutations produced substantial (greater than twofold) phenotypes of either increased or decreased splicing. Of all predicted secondary structural elements, only a single 15-nt stem-loop showed a strong correlation with splicing, acting negatively. The in vitro formation of exon-protein complexes between the mutant molecules and proteins associated with spliceosome formation (U2AF35, U2AF65, U1A, and U1-70K) correlated with splicing efficiencies, suggesting exon definition as the step affected by most mutations. The measured relative binding affinities of dozens of human RNA binding protein domains as reported in the CISBP-RNA database were found to correlate either positively or negatively with splicing efficiency, more than could fit on the 51-nt test exon simultaneously. The large number of these functional protein binding correlations point to a dynamic and heterogeneous population of pre-mRNA molecules, each responding to a particular collection of binding proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Scalable, high-throughput DNA sequencing is a prerequisite for precision medicine and biomedical research. Recently, we presented a nanopore-based sequencing-by-synthesis (Nanopore-SBS) approach, which used a set of nucleotides with polymer tags that allow discrimination of the nucleotides in a biological nanopore. Here, we designed and covalently coupled a DNA polymerase to an \u03b1-hemolysin (\u03b1HL) heptamer using the SpyCatcher/SpyTag conjugation approach. These porin-polymerase conjugates were inserted into lipid bilayers on a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-based electrode array for high-throughput electrical recording of DNA synthesis. The designed nanopore construct successfully detected the capture of tagged nucleotides complementary to a DNA base on a provided template. We measured over 200 tagged-nucleotide signals for each of the four bases and developed a classification method to uniquely distinguish them from each other and background signals. The probability of falsely identifying a background event as a true capture event was less than 1.2%. In the presence of all four tagged nucleotides, we observed sequential additions in real time during polymerase-catalyzed DNA synthesis. Single-polymerase coupling to a nanopore, in combination with the Nanopore-SBS approach, can provide the foundation for a low-cost, single-molecule, electronic DNA-sequencing platform.",

        "Abstract": "DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) offers a robust platform to decipher nucleic acid sequences. Recently, we reported a single-molecule nanopore-based SBS strategy that accurately distinguishes four bases by electronically detecting and differentiating four different polymer tags attached to the 5'-phosphate of the nucleotides during their incorporation into a growing DNA strand catalyzed by DNA polymerase. Further developing this approach, we report here the use of nucleotides tagged at the terminal phosphate with oligonucleotide-based polymers to perform nanopore SBS on an \u03b1-hemolysin nanopore array platform. We designed and synthesized several polymer-tagged nucleotides using tags that produce different electrical current blockade levels and verified they are active substrates for DNA polymerase. A highly processive DNA polymerase was conjugated to the nanopore, and the conjugates were complexed with primer/template DNA and inserted into lipid bilayers over individually addressable electrodes of the nanopore chip. When an incoming complementary-tagged nucleotide forms a tight ternary complex with the primer/template and polymerase, the tag enters the pore, and the current blockade level is measured. The levels displayed by the four nucleotides tagged with four different polymers captured in the nanopore in such ternary complexes were clearly distinguishable and sequence-specific, enabling continuous sequence determination during the polymerase reaction. Thus, real-time single-molecule electronic DNA sequencing data with single-base resolution were obtained. The use of these polymer-tagged nucleotides, combined with polymerase tethering to nanopores and multiplexed nanopore sensors, should lead to new high-throughput sequencing methods.",

        "Abstract": "Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based on nanostructured platforms is a promising technique for quantitative and highly sensitive detection of biomolecules in the field of analytical biochemistry. Here, we report a mathematical model to predict experimental SERS signal (or hotspot) intensity distributions of target molecules on receptor-functionalized nanopillar substrates for biomolecular quantification. We demonstrate that by utilizing only a small set of empirically determined parameters, our general theoretical framework agrees with the experimental data particularly well in the picomolar concentration regimes. This developed model may be generally used for biomolecular quantification using Raman mapping on SERS substrates with planar geometries, in which the hotspots are approximated as electromagnetic enhancement fields generated by closely spaced dimers. Lastly, we also show that the detection limit of a specific target molecule, TAMRA-labeled vasopressin, approaches the single molecule level, thus opening up an exciting new chapter in the field of SERS quantification.",

Conventional SNP genotyping methods are capable of providing either accurate or high-throughput detection, but are still labor-, time-, and resource-intensive. Microfluidics has been applied to SNP detection to provide fast, low-cost, and automated alternatives, although these applications are still limited by either accuracy or throughput issues. To address this challenge, we present a MEMS-based SNP genotyping approach that uses solid-phase-based reactions in a single microchamber on a temperature control chip. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), allele specific single base extension (SBE), and desalting on microbeads are performed in the microchamber, which is coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to analyze the SBE product. Experimental results from genotyping of the SNP on exon 1 of the HBB gene, which causes sickle cell anemia, demonstrate the potential of the device for rapid, accurate, multiplexed and high-throughput detection of SNPs.",

        "Abstract": "Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant type of genetic variations; they provide the genetic fingerprint of individuals and are essential for genetic biomarker discoveries. Accurate detection of SNPs is of great significance for disease prevention, diagnosis and prognosis, and for prediction of drug response and clinical outcomes in patients. Nevertheless, conventional SNP genotyping methods are still limited by insufficient accuracy or labor-, time-, and resource-intensive procedures. Microfluidics has been increasingly utilized to improve efficiency; however, the currently available microfluidic genotyping systems still have shortcomings in accuracy, sensitivity, throughput and multiplexing capability. To address these challenges, we developed a multi-step SNP genotyping microfluidic device, which performs single-base extension of SNP specific primers and solid-phase purification of the extension products on a temperature-controlled chip. The products are ready for immediate detection by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), providing identification of the alleles at the target loci. The integrated device enables efficient and automated operation, while maintaining the high accuracy and sensitivity provided by MS. The multiplex genotyping capability was validated by performing rapid, accurate and simultaneous detection of 4 loci on a synthetic template. The microfluidic device has the potential to perform automatic, accurate, quantitative and high-throughput assays covering a broad spectrum of applications in biological and clinical research, drug development and forensics.",

Here, we report a SERS-based biosensing approach for quantitative detection of biomolecules. A SERS substrate bearing gold-decorated silicon nanopillars is functionalized with aptamers for sensitive and specific detection of target molecules. In this study, TAMRA-labeled vasopressin molecules in the picomolar regime (1 pM to 1 nM) are specifically captured by aptamers on the nanostructured SERS substrate and monitored by using an automated SERS signal mapping technique. From the experimental results, we show concentration-dependent SERS responses in the picomolar range by integrating SERS signal intensities over a scanning area. It is also noted that our signal mapping approach significantly improves statistical reproducibility and accounts for spot-to-spot variation in conventional SERS quantification. Furthermore, we have developed an analytical model capable of predicting experimental intensity distributions on the substrates for reliable quantification of biomolecules. Lastly, we have calculated the minimum needed area of Raman mapping for efficient and reliable analysis of each measurement. Combining our SERS mapping analysis with an aptamer-functionalized nanopillar substrate is found to be extremely efficient for detection of low-abundance biomolecules.",

Our approach is based on the characterization of RNA transport complexes carried by molecular motor kinesin. Using this strategy in Aplysia, we have identified 5,657 unique sequences consisting of both coding and noncoding RNAs from the CNS. Several of these RNAs have key roles in the maintenance of synaptic function and growth. One of these RNAs, myosin heavy chain, is critical in presynaptic sensory neurons for the establishment of long-term facilitation, but not for its persistence.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a novel single molecule nanopore-based sequencing by synthesis (Nano-SBS) strategy that can accurately distinguish four bases by detecting 4 different sized tags released from 5'-phosphate-modified nucleotides. The basic principle is as follows. As each nucleotide is incorporated into the growing DNA strand during the polymerase reaction, its tag is released and enters a nanopore in release order. This produces a unique ionic current blockade signature due to the tag's distinct chemical structure, thereby determining DNA sequence electronically at single molecule level with single base resolution. As proof of principle, we attached four different length PEG-coumarin tags to the terminal phosphate of 2'-deoxyguanosine-5'-tetraphosphate. We demonstrate efficient, accurate incorporation of the nucleotide analogs during the polymerase reaction, and excellent discrimination among the four tags based on nanopore ionic currents. This approach coupled with polymerase attached to the nanopores in an array format should yield a single-molecule electronic Nano-SBS platform.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 helicase couples adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding and hydrolysis to polynucleotide unwinding. Understanding the regulation mechanism of ATP binding will facilitate targeting of the ATP-binding site for potential therapeutic development for hepatitis C. T324, an amino acid residue connecting domains 1 and 2 of NS3 helicase, has been suggested as part of a flexible hinge for opening of the ATP-binding cleft, although the detailed mechanism remains largely unclear. We used computational simulation to examine the mutational effect of T324 on the dynamics of the ATP-binding site. A mutant model, T324A, of the NS3 helicase apo structure was created and energy was minimized. Molecular dynamics simulation was conducted for both wild type and the T324A mutant apo structures to compare their differences. For the mutant structure, histogram analysis of pairwise distances between residues in domains 1 and 2 (E291-Q460, K210-R464 and R467-T212) showed that separation between the two domains was reduced by ~10% and the standard deviation by ~33%. Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) analysis demonstrated that residues in close proximity to residue 324 have at least 30% RMSF value reductions in the mutant structure. Solvent RMSF analysis showed that more water molecules were trapped near D290 and H293 in domain 1 to form an extensive interaction network constraining cleft opening. We also demonstrated that the T324A mutation established a new atomic interaction with V331, revealing that an atomic interaction cascade from T324 to residues in domains 1 and 2 controls the flexibility of the ATP-binding cleft.",

        "Abstract": "Characterization of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mutations is crucial for disease diagnosis, which requires accurate and sensitive detection methods and quantification due to mitochondrial heteroplasmy. We report here the characterization of mutations for myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers syndrome using chemically cleavable biotinylated dideoxynucleotides and a mass spectrometry (MS)-based solid phase capture (SPC) single base extension (SBE) assay. The method effectively eliminates unextended primers and primer dimers, and the presence of cleavable linkers between the base and biotin allows efficient desalting and release of the DNA products from solid phase for MS analysis. This approach is capable of high multiplexing, and the use of different length linkers for each of the purines and each of the pyrimidines permits better discrimination of the four bases by MS. Both homoplasmic and heteroplasmic genotypes were accurately determined on different mtDNA samples. The specificity of the method for mtDNA detection was validated by using mitochondrial DNA-negative cells. The sensitivity of the approach permitted detection of less than 5% mtDNA heteroplasmy levels. This indicates that the SPC-SBE approach based on chemically cleavable biotinylated dideoxynucleotides and MS enables rapid, accurate, and sensitive genotyping of mtDNA and has broad applications for genetic analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)-based methods have been widely explored for DNA sequencing. We report here the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a novel set of chemically cleavable biotinylated dideoxynucleotides, ddNTPs-N\u2083-biotin, for the DNA polymerase extension reaction and its application in DNA sequencing by mass spectrometry (MS). These nucleotide analogs have a biotin moiety attached to the 5 position of the pyrimidines (C and U) or the 7 position of the purines (A and G) via a chemically cleavable azido-based linker, with different length linker arms serving as mass tags that contribute to large mass differences among the nucleotides. We demonstrate that these modified nucleotides are efficiently incorporated by DNA polymerase, and the DNA strand bearing biotinylated nucleotides is captured by streptavidin-coated beads and efficiently released using tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in aqueous solution, which is compatible with DNA and downstream procedures. We performed Sanger sequencing reactions using these nucleotides to generate DNA fragments for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Both synthetic DNA and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were accurately decoded, and a read length of approximately 37 bases was achieved using these nucleotides in MS sequencing.",

        "Abstract": "Due to their high sensitivity and selectivity, minimum interference with living biological systems, and ease of design and synthesis, fluorescent hybridization probes have been widely used to detect nucleic acids both in vivo and in vitro. Molecular beacons (MBs) and binary probes (BPs) are two very important hybridization probes that are designed based on well-established photophysical principles. These probes have shown particular applicability in a variety of studies, such as mRNA tracking, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) monitoring, and microorganism identification. Molecular beacons are hairpin oligonucleotide probes that present distinctive fluorescent signatures in the presence and absence of their target. Binary probes consist of two fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide strands that can hybridize to adjacent regions of their target and generate distinctive fluorescence signals. These probes have been extensively studied and modified for different applications by modulating their structures or using various combinations of fluorophores, excimer-forming molecules, and metal complexes. This review describes the applicability and advantages of various hybridization probes that utilize novel and creative design to enhance their target detection sensitivity and specificity.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a comprehensive quantitative measure of the splicing impact of a complete set of RNA 6-mer sequences by deep sequencing successfully spliced transcripts. All 4096 6-mers were substituted at five positions within two different internal exons in a 3-exon minigene, and millions of successfully spliced transcripts were sequenced after transfection of human cells. The results allowed the assignment of a relative splicing strength score to each mutant molecule. The effect of 6-mers on splicing often depended on their location; much of this context effect could be ascribed to the creation of different overlapping sequences at each site. Taking these overlaps into account, the splicing effect of each 6-mer could be quantified, and 6-mers could be designated as enhancers (ESEseqs) and silencers (ESSseqs), with an ESRseq score indicating their strength. Some 6-mers exhibited positional bias relative to the two splice sites. The distribution and conservation of these ESRseqs in and around human exons supported their classification. Predicted RNA secondary structure effects were also seen: Effective enhancers, silencers and 3' splice sites tend to be single stranded, and effective 5' splice sites tend to be double stranded. 6-mers that may form positive or negative synergy with another were also identified. Chromatin structure may also influence the splicing enhancement observed, as a good correspondence was found between splicing performance and the predicted nucleosome occupancy scores of 6-mers. This approach may prove of general use in defining nucleic acid regulatory motifs, substitute for functional SELEX in most cases, and provide insights about splicing mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "We have developed a new approach to systematically study post-transcriptional regulation in a small number of cells. Actively translating mRNAs are associated with polysomes and the newly synthesized peptide chains are closely associated with molecular chaperones such as hsp70s, which assist in the proper folding of nascent polypeptides into higher ordered structures. These chaperones provide an anchor with which to separate actively translating mRNAs associated with polysomes from free mRNAs. Affinity capture beads were developed to capture hsp70 chaperones associated with the polysome complexes. The isolated actively translating mRNAs were used for high-throughput expression profiling analysis. Feasibility was demonstrated using an in vitro translation system with known translationally regulated mRNA transcript thymidylate synthase (TS). We further developed the approach using HCT-116 colon cancer cells with both TS and p53 as positive controls. The steady-state levels of TS and p53 mRNAs were unaltered after 5-fluorouracil treatment as assessed by real-time qRT-PCR analysis. In contrast, the protein expression and polysome-associated mRNA levels of both genes were increased. These differences in translational rate were revealed with our new approach from 500 cells. This technology has the potential to make investigation of translational control feasible with limited quantities of clinical specimens.",

        "Title": "An integrated system for DNA sequencing by synthesis using novel nucleotide analogues.",
        "Abstract": "The Human Genome Project has concluded, but its successful completion has increased, rather than decreased, the need for high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies. The possibility of clinically screening a full genome for an individual's mutations offers tremendous benefits, both for pursuing personalized medicine and for uncovering the genomic contributions to diseases. The Sanger sequencing method, although enormously productive for more than 30 years, requires an electrophoretic separation step that, unfortunately, remains a key technical obstacle for achieving economically acceptable full-genome results. Alternative sequencing approaches thus focus on innovations that can reduce costs. The DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) approach has shown great promise as a new sequencing platform, with particular progress reported recently. The general fluorescent SBS approach involves (i) incorporation of nucleotide analogs bearing fluorescent reporters, (ii) identification of the incorporated nucleotide by its fluorescent emissions, and (iii) cleavage of the fluorophore, along with the reinitiation of the polymerase reaction for continuing sequence determination. In this Account, we review the construction of a DNA-immobilized chip and the development of novel nucleotide reporters for the SBS sequencing platform. Click chemistry, with its high selectivity and coupling efficiency, was explored for surface immobilization of DNA. The first generation (G-1) modified nucleotides for SBS feature a small chemical moiety capping the 3'-OH and a fluorophore tethered to the base through a chemically cleavable linker; the design ensures that the nucleotide reporters are good substrates for the polymerase. The 3'-capping moiety and the fluorophore on the DNA extension products, generated by the incorporation of the G-1 modified nucleotides, are cleaved simultaneously to reinitiate the polymerase reaction. The sequence of a DNA template immobilized on a surface via click chemistry is unambiguously identified with this chip-SBS system. The second generation (G-2) SBS system was developed based on the concept that the closer the structures of the added nucleotide and the primer are to their natural counterparts, the more faithfully the polymerase would incorporate the nucleotide. In this approach, the polymerase reaction is performed with the combination of 3'-capped nucleotide reversible terminators (NRTs) and cleavable fluorescent dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs). By sacrifice of a small amount of the primers permanently terminated by ddNTPs, the majority of the primers extended by the reversible terminators are reverted to the natural ones after each sequencing cycle. We have also developed the 3'-capped nucleotide reversible terminators to solve the problem of deciphering the homopolymeric regions of the template in conventional pyrosequencing. The 3'-capping moiety on the DNA extension product temporarily terminates the polymerase reaction, which allows only one nucleotide to be incorporated during each sequencing cycle. Thus, the number of nucleotides in the homopolymeric regions are unambiguously determined using the 3'-capped NRTs. It has been established that millions of DNA templates can be immobilized on a chip surface through a variety of approaches. Therefore, the integration of these high-density DNA chips with the molecular-level SBS approaches described in this Account is expected to generate a high-throughput and accurate DNA sequencing system with wide applications in biological research and health care.",

        "Title": "Centrotemporal sharp wave EEG trait in rolandic epilepsy maps to Elongator Protein Complex 4 (ELP4).",
        "Abstract": "Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common human epilepsy, affecting children between 3 and 12 years of age, boys more often than girls (3:2). Focal sharp waves in the centrotemporal area define the electroencephalographic (EEG) trait for the syndrome, are a feature of several related childhood epilepsies and are frequently observed in common developmental disorders (eg, speech dyspraxia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and developmental coordination disorder). Here we report the first genome-wide linkage scan in RE for the EEG trait, centrotemporal sharp waves (CTS), with genome-wide linkage of CTS to 11p13 (HLOD 4.30). Pure likelihood statistical analysis refined our linkage peak by fine mapping CTS to variants in Elongator Protein Complex 4 (ELP4) in two independent data sets; the strongest evidence was with rs986527 in intron 9 of ELP4, providing a likelihood ratio of 629:1 (P=0.0002) in favor of an association. Resequencing of ELP4 coding, flanking and promoter regions revealed no significant exonic polymorphisms. This is the first report of a gene implicated in a common focal epilepsy and the first human disease association of ELP4. ELP4 is a component of the Elongator complex, involved in transcription and tRNA modification. Elongator depletion results in the brain-specific downregulation of genes implicated in cell motility and migration. We hypothesize that a non-coding mutation in ELP4 impairs brain-specific Elongator-mediated interaction of genes implicated in brain development, resulting in susceptibility to seizures and neurodevelopmental disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were established from various tissues of the giant tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon). To simultaneously examine expression patterns of a large number of transcripts in ovaries and testes of P. monodon, a cDNA microarray (ReproArray(GTS)) containing 4992 features amplified from cDNAs of ovary (1920) and testis (3072) EST libraries was constructed and subjected to high-throughput gene expression analysis in four different stages of ovarian development (previtellogenesis, vitellogenesis, early cortical rod and late cortical rod stages). Several transcripts were found to be differentially expressed during P. monodon ovarian development. Among many important reproduction-related genes with differential expression from microarray data, nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein (NASP) was further characterized by RACE-PCR. The full-length cDNA of P. monodon NASP (PmNASP) was 2126 bp in length containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 1812 bp corresponding to a deduced protein of 603 amino acids with 5? and 3?UTRs of 93 and 202 bp (excluding the poly A tail), respectively. Higher PmNASP transcript levels at later stages of ovarian development was consistently confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. This study indicated that ReproArray(GTS) is effective for high-throughput screening of genes that play important roles in ovarian development of P. monodon.",

        "Abstract": "We demonstrate a simple means to covalently bond DNA to both hard (i.e., glass and silicon wafers) and soft (i.e., polymeric) substrates that provides quantitative and precise control of the DNA areal density. The approach is based on spin coating an alkyne-end-functional diblock copolymer, alpha-alkyne-omega-Br-poly( tBA- b-MMA), that self-assembles on both types of substrates as an ordered monolayer and thereby directs alkyne groups to the surface. Azido-functionalized DNA is covalently linked to the alkyne functionalized substrates by means of a \"click\" reaction between azide and alkyne groups. The density of immobilized DNA can be quantitatively controlled by varying the parameters used for spin-coating the copolymer film, that is, solution concentration and rotational speed, or by varying the copolymer molecular weight. We find the yield of the DNA coupling reaction to be dependent on the nature of the polymer underlying the reactive alkyne functional groups, being higher for more hydrophilic polymers.",

        "Abstract": "DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) on a solid surface during polymerase reaction can decipher many sequences in parallel. We report here a DNA sequencing method that is a hybrid between the Sanger dideoxynucleotide terminating reaction and SBS. In this approach, four nucleotides, modified as reversible terminators by capping the 3'-OH with a small reversible moiety so that they are still recognized by DNA polymerase as substrates, are combined with four cleavable fluorescent dideoxynucleotides to perform SBS. The ratio of the two sets of nucleotides is adjusted as the extension cycles proceed. Sequences are determined by the unique fluorescence emission of each fluorophore on the DNA products terminated by ddNTPs. On removing the 3'-OH capping group from the DNA products generated by incorporating the 3'-O-modified dNTPs and the fluorophore from the DNA products terminated with the ddNTPs, the polymerase reaction reinitiates to continue the sequence determination. By using an azidomethyl group as a chemically reversible capping moiety in the 3'-O-modified dNTPs, and an azido-based cleavable linker to attach the fluorophores to the ddNTPs, we synthesized four 3'-O-azidomethyl-dNTPs and four ddNTP-azidolinker-fluorophores for the hybrid SBS. After sequence determination by fluorescence imaging, the 3'-O-azidomethyl group and the fluorophore attached to the DNA extension product via the azidolinker are efficiently removed by using Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in aqueous solution that is compatible with DNA. Various DNA templates, including those with homopolymer regions, were accurately sequenced with a read length of >30 bases by using this hybrid SBS method on a chip and a four-color fluorescence scanner.",

        "Title": "\"Click-functional\" block copolymers provide precise surface functionality via spin coating.",
        "Abstract": "There are few existing methods for the quantitative functionalization of surfaces, especially for polymeric substrates. We demonstrate that alkyne end-functional diblock copolymers can be used to provide precise areal densities of reactive functionality on both hard (e.g., glass and silicon oxide) and soft (i.e., polymeric) substrates. Alkyne functionality is extremely versatile because the resultant functional surfaces are reactive toward azide functional molecules by Sharpless click chemistry. Spin-coated films of alpha-alkyne-omega-Br-poly( tert-butylacrylate- b-methylmethacrylate) (poly( tBA-MMA)) spontaneously self-assemble on the aforementioned substrates to present a surface monolayer of PtBA with a thickness in the range of 1 to 9 nm. The PMMA block physisorbs to provide multivalent anchoring onto hard substrates and is fixed onto polymer surfaces by interpenetration with the substrate polymer. The areal density of alkyne functional groups is precisely controlled by adjusting the thickness of the block copolymer monolayer, which is accomplished by changing either the spin coating conditions (i.e., rotational speed and solution concentration) or the copolymer molecular weight. The reactivity of surface-bound alkynes, in 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions or by so-called \"click chemistry\", is demonstrated by covalent surface immobilization of fluorescently labeled azides. The modificed surfaces are characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle, ellipsometry, fluorescent imaging and angle-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ADXPS) measurements. Microarrays of covalently bound fluorescent molecules are created to demonstrate the approach and their performance is evaluated by determining their fluorescence signal-to-noise ratios.",

        "Abstract": "The functions of non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) in tumorigenesis are just beginning to emerge. Previous studies from our laboratory have identified a number of miRNAs that were deregulated in colon cancer cell lines due to the deletion of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. In this study, the in vivo significance of some of these miRNAs was further evaluated using colorectal clinical samples. Ten miRNAs (hsa-let-7b, hsa-let-7g, hsa-miR-15b, hsa-miR-181b, hsa-miR-191, hsa-miR-200c, hsa-miR-26a, hsa-miR-27a, hsa-miR-30a-5p and hsa-miR-30c) were evaluated for their potential prognostic value in colorectal cancer patients. Forty eight snap frozen clinical colorectal samples (24 colorectal cancer and 24 paired normal patient samples) with detailed clinical follow-up information were selected. The expression levels of 10 miRNAs were quantified via qRT-PCR analysis. The statistical significance of these markers for disease prognosis was evaluated using a two tailed paired Wilcoxon test. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was generated followed by performing a Logrank test. Among the ten miRNAs, hsa-miR-15b (p = 0.0278), hsa-miR-181b (p = 0.0002), hsa-miR-191 (p = 0.0264) and hsa-miR-200c (p = 0.0017) were significantly over-expressed in tumors compared to normal colorectal samples. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that hsa-miR-200c was significantly associated with patient survival (p = 0.0122). The patients (n = 15) with higher hsa-miR-200c expression had a shorter survival time (median survival = 26 months) compared to patients (n = 9) with lower expression (median survival = 38 months). Sequencing analysis revealed that hsa-miR-181b (p = 0.0098) and hsa-miR-200c (p = 0.0322) expression were strongly associated with the mutation status of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Some of these miRNAs may function as oncogenes due to their over-expression in tumors. hsa-miR-200c may be a potential novel prognostic factor in colorectal cancer.",

        "Title": "3'-O-modified nucleotides as reversible terminators for pyrosequencing.",
        "Abstract": "Pyrosequencing is a method used to sequence DNA by detecting the pyrophosphate (PPi) group that is generated when a nucleotide is incorporated into the growing DNA strand in polymerase reaction. However, this method has an inherent difficulty in accurately deciphering the homopolymeric regions of the DNA templates. We report here the development of a method to solve this problem by using nucleotide reversible terminators. These nucleotide analogues are modified with a reversible chemical moiety capping the 3'-OH group to temporarily terminate the polymerase reaction. In this way, only one nucleotide is incorporated into the growing DNA strand even in homopolymeric regions. After detection of the PPi for sequence determination, the 3'-OH of the primer extension products is regenerated through different deprotection methods. Using an allyl or a 2-nitrobenzyl group as the reversible moiety to cap the 3'-OH of the four nucleotides, we have synthesized two sets of 3'-O-modified nucleotides, 3'-O-allyl-dNTPs and 3'-O-(2-nitrobenzyl)-dNTPs as reversible terminators for pyrosequencing. The capping moiety on the 3'-OH of the DNA extension product is efficiently removed after PPi detection by either a chemical method or photolysis. To sequence DNA, templates containing homopolymeric regions are immobilized on Sepharose beads, and then extension-signal detection-deprotection cycles are conducted by using the nucleotide reversible terminators on the DNA beads to unambiguously decipher the sequence of DNA templates. Our results establish that this reversible-terminator-pyrosequencing approach can be potentially developed into a powerful methodology to accurately determine DNA sequences.",

        "Abstract": "Recently identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) isolates that are infectious in cell culture provide a genetic system to evaluate the significance of virus-host interactions for HCV replication. We have completed a systematic RNAi screen wherein siRNAs were designed that target 62 host genes encoding proteins that physically interact with HCV RNA or proteins or belong to cellular pathways thought to modulate HCV infection. This includes 10 host proteins that we identify in this study to bind HCV NS5A. siRNAs that target 26 of these host genes alter infectious HCV production >3-fold. Included in this set of 26 were siRNAs that target Dicer, a principal component of the RNAi silencing pathway. Contrary to the hypothesis that RNAi is an antiviral pathway in mammals, as has been reported for subgenomic HCV replicons, siRNAs that target Dicer inhibited HCV replication. Furthermore, siRNAs that target several other components of the RNAi pathway also inhibit HCV replication. MicroRNA profiling of human liver, human hepatoma Huh-7.5 cells, and Huh-7.5 cells that harbor replicating HCV demonstrated that miR-122 is the predominant microRNA in each environment. miR-122 has been previously implicated in positively regulating the replication of HCV genotype 1 replicons. We find that 2'-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotide depletion of miR-122 also inhibits HCV genotype 2a replication and infectious virus production. Our data define 26 host genes that modulate HCV infection and indicate that the requirement for functional RNAi for HCV replication is dominant over any antiviral activity this pathway may exert against HCV.",

        "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding regulatory RNAs that reduce stability and/or translation of fully or partially sequence-complementary target mRNAs. In order to identify miRNAs and to assess their expression patterns, we sequenced over 250 small RNA libraries from 26 different organ systems and cell types of human and rodents that were enriched in neuronal as well as normal and malignant hematopoietic cells and tissues. We present expression profiles derived from clone count data and provide computational tools for their analysis. Unexpectedly, a relatively small set of miRNAs, many of which are ubiquitously expressed, account for most of the differences in miRNA profiles between cell lineages and tissues. This broad survey also provides detailed and accurate information about mature sequences, precursors, genome locations, maturation processes, inferred transcriptional units, and conservation patterns. We also propose a subclassification scheme for miRNAs for assisting future experimental and computational functional analyses.",

        "Abstract": "We describe the design of new fluorescent binary probe sensors for DNA detection based on spin-forbidden resonance energy transfer (SF-RET). Binary probes consist of a donor and acceptor fluorophores that are attached to two different oligonucleotides and serve as resonance energy transfer (RET) donor-acceptor pair when hybridized to adjacent sites of a target sequence. In the absence of target, excitation of the donor results in fluorescence only from the donor, but when the probes hybridize to target, the fluorophores are brought into close proximity favoring RET, yielding fluorescence mainly from the acceptor fluorophore. These new binary probes use the metal complex Ru(bpy\u2032)(DIP)",

        "Abstract": "We outline the different approaches taken by our group in the design of fluorescent hybridization sensors. Molecular beacons (MBs) and binary probes (BPs) using two dyes (2d-MB and 2d-BP, respectively) have been synthesized; these sensors serve as switches in emission upon binding to target biomolecules, such as DNA. These sensors allow for ratiometric fluorescence detection of polynucleotides (PNs) by visualization of the probes when bound to a target PN. Additionally, three-dye MBs (3d-MB) and BPs (3d-BP) have been developed, where an energy-transfer cascade is employed to decrease the overlap between the fluorophore emission spectra, resulting in a low direct excitation of the acceptor fluorophore. Pyrene-based MB (Py-MB) and BP (Py-BP), which possess the advantage of long fluorescence lifetimes, have also been synthesized. Time-resolved fluorescence spectra (TRES) can be used to discriminate between short-lived background fluorescence and long-lived fluorescence of the pyrene probes. This technique was demonstrated by time-resolving the signal of a Py-BP from the background fluorescence in Aplysia californica cell extracts.",

        "Abstract": "We report the design, synthesis and characterization of binary oligonucleotide probes for mRNA detection. The probes were designed to avoid common problems found in standard binary probes such as direct excitation of the acceptor fluorophore and overlap between the donor and acceptor emission spectra. Two different probes were constructed that contained an array of either two or three dyes and that were characterized using steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence depolarization measurements. The three-dye binary probe (BP-3d) consists of a Fam fluorophore which acts as a donor, collecting light and transferring it as energy to Tamra, which subsequently transfers energy to Cy5 when the two probes are hybridized to mRNA. This design allows the use of 488 nm excitation, which avoids the direct excitation of Cy5 and at the same time provides a good fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency. The two-dye binary probe system (BP-2d) was constructed of Alexa488 and Cy5 fluorophores. Although the overlap between the fluorescence of Alexa488 and the absorption of Cy5 is relatively low, FRET still occurs due to their close physical proximity when the probes are hybridized to mRNA. This framework also decreases the direct excitation of Cy5 and reduces the fluorescence overlap between the donor and the acceptor. Picosecond time-resolved spectroscopy showed a reduction in the fluorescence lifetime of donor fluorophores after the formation of the hybrid between the probes and target mRNA. Interestingly, BP-2d in the presence of mRNA shows a slow rise in the fluorescence decay of Cy5 due to a relatively low FRET rate, which together with the reduction in the Alexa488 lifetime provides a way to improve the signal to background ratio using time-resolved fluorescence spectra (TRES). In addition, fluorescence depolarization measurements showed complete depolarization of the acceptor dyes (Cy5) for both BP-3d (due to sequential FRET steps) and BP-2d (due to the relatively low FRET rate) in the presence of the mRNA target.",

        "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of small noncoding RNAs that modulate the expression of genes at the posttranscriptional level. These small molecules have been shown to be involved in cancer, apoptosis, and cell metabolism. In the present study we provide an informative profile of the expression of miRNAs in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells using 2 independent and quantitative methods: miRNA cloning and quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) of mature miRNAs. Both approaches show that miR-21 and miR-155 are dramatically overexpressed in patients with CLL, although the corresponding genomic loci are not amplified. miR-150 and miR-92 are also significantly deregulated in patients with CLL. In addition, we detected a marked miR-15a and miR-16 decrease in about 11% of cases. Finally, we identified a set of miRNAs whose expression correlates with biologic parameters of prognostic relevance, particularly with the mutational status of the IgV(H) genes. In summary, the results of this study offer for the first time a comprehensive and quantitative profile of miRNA expression in CLL and their healthy counterpart, suggesting that miRNAs could play a primary role in the disease itself.",

        "Abstract": "Molecular analyses of Aplysia, a well-established model organism for cellular and systems neural science, have been seriously handicapped by a lack of adequate genomic information. By sequencing cDNA libraries from the central nervous system (CNS), we have identified over 175,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), of which 19,814 are unique neuronal gene products and represent 50%-70% of the total Aplysia neuronal transcriptome. We have characterized the transcriptome at three levels: (1) the central nervous system, (2) the elementary components of a simple behavior: the gill-withdrawal reflex-by analyzing sensory, motor, and serotonergic modulatory neurons, and (3) processes of individual neurons. In addition to increasing the amount of available gene sequences of Aplysia by two orders of magnitude, this collection represents the largest database available for any member of the Lophotrochozoa and therefore provides additional insights into evolutionary strategies used by this highly successful diversified lineage, one of the three proposed superclades of bilateral animals.",

        "Abstract": "DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) on a solid surface during polymerase reaction offers a paradigm to decipher DNA sequences. We report here the construction of such a DNA sequencing system using molecular engineering approaches. In this approach, four nucleotides (A, C, G, T) are modified as reversible terminators by attaching a cleavable fluorophore to the base and capping the 3'-OH group with a small chemically reversible moiety so that they are still recognized by DNA polymerase as substrates. We found that an allyl moiety can be used successfully as a linker to tether a fluorophore to 3'-O-allyl-modified nucleotides, forming chemically cleavable fluorescent nucleotide reversible terminators, 3'-O-allyl-dNTPs-allyl-fluorophore, for application in SBS. The fluorophore and the 3'-O-allyl group on a DNA extension product, which is generated by incorporating 3'-O-allyl-dNTPs-allyl-fluorophore in a polymerase reaction, are removed simultaneously in 30 s by Pd-catalyzed deallylation in aqueous buffer solution. This one-step dual-deallylation reaction thus allows the reinitiation of the polymerase reaction and increases the SBS efficiency. DNA templates consisting of homopolymer regions were accurately sequenced by using this class of fluorescent nucleotide analogues on a DNA chip and a four-color fluorescent scanner.",

Concern that a novel pathogen might be implicated led us to implement a new multiplex diagnostic tool. MassTag polymerase chain reaction resolved 26 of 79 previously negative samples, revealing the presence of rhinoviruses in a large proportion of samples, half of which belonged to a previously uncharacterized genetic clade. In some instances, knowledge of the detected viral and/or bacterial (co)infection could have altered clinical management.",

        "Abstract": "We report the design, synthesis, and characterization of molecular beacons (MB) consisting of three distinct fluorophores, 6-carboxyfluorescein (Fam), N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (Tam), and Cyanine-5 (Cy5). The primary light absorber/energy donor (Fam) is located on one terminus of the MB, whereas the primary energy acceptor/secondary donor (Tam) and secondary acceptor (Cy5) are located at the other terminus of the MB. In the absence of target DNA or RNA, the MB exists in the stem-closed form. Excitation of Fam initiates an energy transfer cascade from Fam to Tam and further to Cy5 generating unique fluorescence signatures defined as the ratio of the emission from each of the three fluorophores. This energy transfer cascade was investigated in detail by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as fluorescence depolarization studies. In the presence of the complementary target DNA, the MB opened efficiently and hybridized with the target separating Fam and Tam by a large distance, so that energy transfer from Fam to Tam was blocked in the stem-open form. This opening of the MB generates a \"bar code\" fluorescence signature, which is different from the signature of the stem-closed MB. The fluorescence signature of this combinatorial fluorescence energy transfer MB can be tuned by variation of the spacer length between the individual fluorophores.",

We describe a computational pattern recognition method that is used to predict the methylation landscape of human brain DNA. This method can be applied both to CpG islands and to non-CpG island regions. It computes the methylation propensity for an 800-bp region centered on a CpG dinucleotide based on specific sequence features within the region. We tested several classifiers for classification performance, including K means clustering, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and support vector machine. The best performing classifier used the support vector machine approach. Our program (called hdfinder) presently has a prediction accuracy of 86%, as validated with CpG regions for which methylation status has been experimentally determined. Using hdfinder, we have depicted the entire genomic methylation patterns for all 22 human autosomes.",

        "Abstract": "We report here the design, synthesis and application of pyrene binary oligonucleotide probes for selective detection of cellular mRNA. The detection strategy is based on the formation of a fluorescent excimer when two pyrene groups are brought into close proximity upon hybridization of the probes with the target mRNA. The pyrene excimer has a long fluorescence lifetime (>40 ns) compared with that of cellular extracts (approximately 7 ns), allowing selective detection of the excimer using time-resolved emission spectra (TRES). Optimized probes were used to target a specific region of sensorin mRNA yielding a strong excimer emission peak at 485 nm in the presence of the target and no excimer emission in the absence of the target in buffer solution. While direct fluorescence measurement of neuronal extracts showed a strong fluorescent background, obscuring the detection of the excimer signal, time-resolved emission measurements indicated that the emission decay of the cellular extracts is approximately 8 times faster than that of the pyrene excimer probes. Thus, using TRES of the pyrene probes, we are able to selectively detect mRNA in the presence of cellular extracts, demonstrating the potential for application of pyrene excimer probes for imaging mRNAs in cellular environments that have background fluorescence.",

        "Abstract": "Small RNAs bound to Argonaute proteins recognize partially or fully complementary nucleic acid targets in diverse gene-silencing processes. A subgroup of the Argonaute proteins--known as the 'Piwi family'--is required for germ- and stem-cell development in invertebrates, and two Piwi members--MILI and MIWI--are essential for spermatogenesis in mouse. Here we describe a new class of small RNAs that bind to MILI in mouse male germ cells, where they accumulate at the onset of meiosis. The sequences of the over 1,000 identified unique molecules share a strong preference for a 5' uridine, but otherwise cannot be readily classified into sequence families. Genomic mapping of these small RNAs reveals a limited number of clusters, suggesting that these RNAs are processed from long primary transcripts. The small RNAs are 26-31 nucleotides (nt) in length--clearly distinct from the 21-23 nt of microRNAs (miRNAs) or short interfering RNAs (siRNAs)--and we refer to them as 'Piwi-interacting RNAs' or piRNAs. Orthologous human chromosomal regions also give rise to small RNAs with the characteristics of piRNAs, but the cloned sequences are distinct. The identification of this new class of small RNAs provides an important starting point to determine the molecular function of Piwi proteins in mammalian spermatogenesis.",

In the absence of the target DNA or RNA the MB is in its stem-closed form and shows efficient energy transfer from the donor (Alexa) to the acceptor (RedX), generating mostly fluorescence from RedX. In the presence of the complementary target DNA the MB opened efficiently, hybridizes with the target DNA, and energy transfer is blocked in the stem-open form. This attachment to the target generates a fluorescence signature, which is clearly distinguishable from the fluorescence signature of the stem-closed form, allowing for ratiometric analysis of the fluorescence signal. In addition to steady-state fluorescence analysis, time resolved fluorescence (ps time range) and fluorescence depolarization studies were performed. We show that fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence depolarization measurements are useful analytical tools to optimize the MB design.",

        "Abstract": "DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) using reversible fluorescent nucleotide terminators is potentially an efficient approach to address the limitations of current DNA sequencing techniques. Here, we report the design and synthesis of a 3'-O-allyl photocleavable fluorescent nucleotide analogue, 3'-O-allyl-dGTP-PC-Bodipy-FL-510, as a reversible terminator for SBS. The nucleotide is efficiently incorporated by DNA polymerase into a growing DNA strand to terminate the polymerase reaction. After that, the fluorophore is photocleaved quantitatively by irradiation at 355 nm, and the allyl group is rapidly and efficiently removed by using a Pd-catalyzed reaction under DNA-compatible conditions to regenerate a free 3'-OH group to reinitiate the polymerase reaction. Two cycles of such steps were successfully demonstrated to sequence a homopolymeric region of a DNA template, facilitating the development of SBS as a viable approach for high-throughput DNA sequencing.",

        "Abstract": "We report the design, synthesis and characterization of a novel molecular beacon (MB-FB) which uses the fluorescent bases (FB) 2-aminopurine (AP) and pyrrolo-dC (P-dC) as fluorophores. Because the quantum yield of these FB depend on hybridization with complementary target, the fluorescent properties of MB-FB were tuned by placing the FB site specifically within the MB such that hybridization with complementary sequence switches from single strand to double strand for AP and vice versa for P-dC. The MB-FB produces a ratiometric fluorescence increase (the fluorescence emission of P-dC over that of AP in the presence and absence of complementary sequence) of 8.5 when excited at 310 nm, the maximum absorption of AP. This ratiometric fluorescence is increased to 14 by further optimizing excitation (325 nm). The fluorescence lifetime is also affected by the addition of target, producing a change in the long-lived component from 6.5 to 8.7 ns (Exc. 310 nm, Em. 450 nm). Thermal denaturation profiles monitored at 450 nm (P-dC emission) show a cooperative denaturation of the MB-FB with a melting temperature of 53 degrees C. The thermal denaturation profile of MB-FB hybridized with its target shows a marked fluorescence reduction at 53 degrees C, consistent with a transition from double stranded helix to random coil DNA.",

The fluorophore and the 3'-allyl group on a DNA extension product, which is generated by incorporating 3'-O-allyl-dGTP-allyl-Bodipy-FL-510, are removed simultaneously in 30 s by Pd-catalyzed deallylation in aqueous buffer solution. The resulting DNA product is successfully used as a primer for further extension in polymerase reaction. This one-pot dual-deallylation reaction thus allows the reinitiation of the polymerase reaction and increases the SBS efficiency.",

        "Title": "Large-scale structure of genomic methylation patterns.",
        "Abstract": "The mammalian genome depends on patterns of methylated cytosines for normal function, but the relationship between genomic methylation patterns and the underlying sequence is unclear. We have characterized the methylation landscape of the human genome by global analysis of patterns of CpG depletion and by direct sequencing of 3073 unmethylated domains and 2565 methylated domains from human brain DNA. The genome was found to consist of short (<4 kb) unmethylated domains embedded in a matrix of long methylated domains. Unmethylated domains were enriched in promoters, CpG islands, and first exons, while methylated domains comprised interspersed and tandem-repeated sequences, exons other than first exons, and non-annotated single-copy sequences that are depleted in the CpG dinucleotide. The enrichment of regulatory sequences in the relatively small unmethylated compartment suggests that cytosine methylation constrains the effective size of the genome through the selective exposure of regulatory sequences. This buffers regulatory networks against changes in total genome size and provides an explanation for the C value paradox, which concerns the wide variations in genome size that scale independently of gene number. This suggestion is compatible with the finding that cytosine methylation is universal among large-genome eukaryotes, while many eukaryotes with genome sizes <5 x 10(8) bp do not methylate their DNA.",

Molecular engineering approaches to modify the building blocks of DNA by introducing functional groups for purification and detection has led to the development of high-throughput genetic analysis technologies. This review is focused on the following two DNA sequencing approaches. The first approach is based on the use of molecular affinity and mass spectrometry to perform quick and highly accurate mutation screening, heterozygote identification and insertion/deletion detection. The second approach is based on a sequencing-by-synthesis platform that has the potential for generating DNA sequencing data in a massive, parallel manner. The basic principles, fundamental challenges and methods of implementation of these exciting new technologies will be discussed.",

        "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a family of small, regulatory, noncoding RNAs that are found in plants and animals. Here, we describe the miRNA profile of the zebrafish Danio rerio resolved in a developmental and cell-type-specific manner. The profiles were obtained from larger-scale sequencing of small RNA libraries prepared from developmentally staged zebrafish, and two adult fibroblast cell lines derived from the caudal fin (ZFL) and the liver epithelium (SJD). We identified a total of 154 distinct miRNAs expressed from 343 miRNA genes. Other experimental/computational sources support an additional 10 miRNAs encoded by 19 genes. The miRNAs can be classified into 87 distinct families. Cross-species comparison indicates that 81 families are conserved in mammals, 17 of which also have at least one member conserved in an invertebrate. Our analysis reveals that the zygotes are essentially devoid of miRNAs and that their expression begins during the blastula period with a zebrafish-specific family of miRNAs encoded by closely spaced multicopy genes. Computational predictions of zebrafish miRNA targets are provided that take into account the depth of evolutionary conservation. Besides miRNAs, we identified a prominent class of repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs).",

        "Abstract": "DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) offers an approach for potential high-throughput sequencing applications. In this method, the ability of an incoming nucleotide to act as a reversible terminator for a DNA polymerase reaction is an important requirement to unambiguously determine the identity of the incorporated nucleotide before the next nucleotide is added. A free 3'-OH group on the terminal nucleotide of the primer is necessary for the DNA polymerase to incorporate an incoming nucleotide. Therefore, if the 3'-OH group of an incoming nucleotide is capped by a chemical moiety, it will cause the polymerase reaction to terminate after the nucleotide is incorporated into the DNA strand. If the capping group is subsequently removed to generate a free 3'-OH, the polymerase reaction will reinitialize. We report here the design and synthesis of a 3'-modified photocleavable fluorescent nucleotide, 3'-O-allyl-dUTP-PC-Bodipy-FL-510 (PC-Bodipy, photocleavable 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3alpha,4alpha-diaza-s-indacene), as a reversible terminator for SBS. This nucleotide analogue contains an allyl moiety capping the 3'-OH group and a fluorophore Bodipy-FL-510 linked to the 5 position of the uracil through a photocleavable 2-nitrobenzyl linker. Here, we have shown that this nucleotide is a good substrate for a DNA polymerase. After the nucleotide was successfully incorporated into a growing DNA strand and the fluorophore was photocleaved, the allyl group was removed by using a Pd-catalyzed reaction to reinitiate the polymerase reaction, thereby establishing the feasibility of using such nucleotide analogues as reversible terminators for SBS.",

        "Title": "Four-color DNA sequencing by synthesis on a chip using photocleavable fluorescent nucleotides.",
        "Abstract": "We report four-color DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) on a chip, using four photocleavable fluorescent nucleotide analogues (dGTP-PC-Bodipy-FL-510, dUTP-PC-R6G, dATP-PC-ROX, and dCTP-PC-Bodipy-650) (PC, photocleavable; Bodipy, 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3alpha,4alpha-diaza-s-indacene; ROX, 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine; R6G, 6-carboxyrhodamine-6G). Each nucleotide analogue consists of a different fluorophore attached to the 5 position of the pyrimidines and the 7 position of the purines through a photocleavable 2-nitrobenzyl linker. After verifying that these nucleotides could be successfully incorporated into a growing DNA strand in a solution-phase polymerase reaction and the fluorophore could be cleaved using laser irradiation ( approximately 355 nm) in 10 sec, we then performed an SBS reaction on a chip that contains a self-priming DNA template covalently immobilized by using 1,3-dipolar azide-alkyne cycloaddition. The DNA template was produced by PCR, using an azido-labeled primer, and the self-priming moiety was attached to the immobilized DNA template by enzymatic ligation. Each cycle of SBS consists of the incorporation of the photocleavable fluorescent nucleotide into the DNA, detection of the fluorescent signal, and photocleavage of the fluorophore. The entire process was repeated to identify 12 continuous bases in the DNA template. These results demonstrate that photocleavable fluorescent nucleotide analogues can be incorporated accurately into a growing DNA strand during a polymerase reaction in solution and on a chip. Moreover, all four fluorophores can be detected and then efficiently cleaved using near-UV irradiation, thereby allowing continuous identification of the DNA template sequence. Optimization of the steps involved in this SBS approach will further increase the read-length.",

        "Title": "Mass-spectrometry DNA sequencing.",
        "Abstract": "Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been explored widely for DNA sequencing. Compared to gel electrophoresis based sequencing systems, mass spectrometry produces very high resolution of sequencing fragments, rapid separation on microsecond time scales, and completely eliminates compressions associated with gel-based systems. While most of the research efforts have focused on using mass spectrometers to analyze the DNA products from Sanger sequencing or enzymatic digestion reactions, the read lengths attainable are currently insufficient for large-scale de novo sequencing. The advantage of mass-spectrometry sequencing is that one can unambiguously identify frameshift mutations and heterozygous mutations making it an ideal choice for resequencing projects. In these applications, DNA sequencing fragments that are the same length but with different base compositions are generated, which are challenging to consistently distinguish in gel-based sequencing systems. In contrast, MALDI-TOF MS produces mass spectra of these DNA sequencing fragments with nearly digital resolution, allowing accurate determination of the mixed bases. For these reasons mass spectrometry based sequencing has mainly been focused on the detection of frameshift mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). More recently, assays have been developed to indirectly sequence DNA by first converting it into RNA. These assays take advantage of the increased resolution and detection ability of MALDI-TOF MS for RNA.",

        "Abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV or HHV4), a member of the human herpesvirus (HHV) family, has recently been shown to encode microRNAs (miRNAs). In contrast to most eukaryotic miRNAs, these viral miRNAs do not have close homologs in other viral genomes or in the genome of the human host. To identify other miRNA genes in pathogenic viruses, we combined a new miRNA gene prediction method with small-RNA cloning from several virus-infected cell types. We cloned ten miRNAs in the Kaposi sarcoma-associated virus (KSHV or HHV8), nine miRNAs in the mouse gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) and nine miRNAs in the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV or HHV5). These miRNA genes are expressed individually or in clusters from either polymerase (pol) II or pol III promoters, and share no substantial sequence homology with one another or with the known human miRNAs. Generally, we predicted miRNAs in several large DNA viruses, and we could neither predict nor experimentally identify miRNAs in the genomes of small RNA viruses or retroviruses.",

        "Abstract": "We present the genomic sequence of Legionella pneumophila, the bacterial agent of Legionnaires' disease, a potentially fatal pneumonia acquired from aerosolized contaminated fresh water. The genome includes a 45-kilobase pair element that can exist in chromosomal and episomal forms, selective expansions of important gene families, genes for unexpected metabolic pathways, and previously unknown candidate virulence determinants. We highlight the genes that may account for Legionella's ability to survive in protozoa, mammalian macrophages, and inhospitable environmental niches and that may define new therapeutic targets.",

        "Title": "Thirtyfold multiplex genotyping of the p53 gene using solid phase capturable dideoxynucleotides and mass spectrometry.",
        "Abstract": "A mass spectrometry (MS) based multiplex genotyping method using solid phase capturable (SPC) dideoxynucleotides and single base extension (SBE), named the SPC-SBE, has been developed for mutation detection. We report here the simultaneous genotyping of 30 potential point mutation sites in exons 5, 7, and 8 of the human p53 gene in one tube using the SPC-SBE method. The 30 mutation sites, including the most frequently mutated p53 codons, were chosen to explore the high multiplexing scope of the SPC-SBE method. Thirty primers specific to each potential mutation site were designed to yield SBE products with sufficient mass differences. This was achieved by tuning the mass of some primers using modified nucleotides. Genomic DNA was amplified by multiplex PCR to produce amplicons of the three p53 exons. The 30 primers were combined with the PCR products and biotinylated dideoxynucleotides for SBE to generate 3'-biotinylated extension DNA products. These products were then captured by streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, while the unextended primers and other components in the reaction were washed away. The pure extension DNA products were subsequently released from the solid phase and analyzed with MS. We simultaneously genotyped 30 potential mutation sites in the p53 gene from Wilms' tumor, head and neck tumor, and colorectal tumor. Both homozygous and heterozygous genotypes were accurately determined with digital resolution. This is the highest level of multiplex genotyping reported thus far using MS, indicating that the approach might be applicable to screening a repertoire of genotypes in candidate genes as potential disease markers.",

        "Abstract": "DNA sequencing by synthesis on a solid surface offers new paradigms to overcome limitations of electrophoresis-based sequencing methods. Here we report DNA sequencing by synthesis using photocleavable (PC) fluorescent nucleotides [dUTP-PC-4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3 alpha,4 alpha-diaza-s-indacene (Bodipy)-FL-510, dCTP-PC-Bodipy-650, and dUTP-PC-6-carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX)] on a glass chip constructed by 1,3-dipolar azide-alkyne cycloaddition coupling chemistry. Each nucleotide analogue consists of a different fluorophore attached to the base through a PC 2-nitrobenzyl linker. We constructed a DNA microarray by using the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition chemistry to site-specifically attach azido-modified DNA onto an alkyne-functionalized glass chip at room temperature under aqueous conditions. After verifying that the polymerase reaction could be carried out successfully on the above-described DNA array, we then performed a sequencing reaction on the chip by using a self-primed DNA template. In the first step, we extended the primer using DNA polymerase and dUTP-PC-Bodipy-FL-510, detected the fluorescent signal from the fluorophore Bodipy-FL-510, and then cleaved the fluorophore using 340 nm UV irradiation. This process was followed by extension of the primer with dCTP-PC-Bodipy-650 and the subsequent detection of the fluorescent signal from Bodipy-650 and its photocleavage. The same procedure was also performed by using dUTP-PC-ROX. The entire process was repeated five times by using the three fluorescent nucleotides to identify 7 bases in the DNA template. These results demonstrate that the PC nucleotide analogues can be incorporated accurately into a growing DNA strand during polymerase reaction on a chip, and the fluorophore can be detected and then efficiently cleaved using near-UV irradiation, thereby allowing the continuous identification of the template sequence.",

        "Abstract": "Deletion or insertion mutations lead to a frameshift that causes misalignment between wild-type and mutated allele sequences, making it difficult to identify such mutations unambiguously by using electrophoresis-based DNA sequencing. We have previously established the feasibility of an accurate DNA sequencing method using solid-phase capturable (SPC) dideoxynucleotides and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on synthetic templates, an approach we refer to as SPC-sequencing. Here, we report the application of SPC-sequencing in characterizing frameshift mutations by using the detection of the BRCA1 gene mutations 185delAG and 5382insC as examples. In this method, Sanger DNA sequencing fragments are generated in one tube by using biotinylated dideoxynucleotides. The sequencing fragments carrying a biotin moiety at the 3' end are captured on a streptavidin-coated solid phase to eliminate excess primer, primer dimers, and false stops. Only correctly terminated DNA fragments are captured, subsequently released, and analyzed by mass spectrometry to obtain digital DNA sequencing data. This method produces distinct doublet mass peaks at each point in the mass spectrum beyond the mutation site, facilitating the accurate characterization of the mutation. We have compared SPC-sequencing with electrophoresis-based sequencing in characterizing the above BRCA1 mutations, demonstrating the significant advantage offered by SPC-sequencing for the accurate identification of frameshift mutations.",

        "Abstract": "We report here the design, synthesis and evaluation of a novel photocleavable (PC) biotinylated nucleotide analog, dUTP-PC-Biotin, for DNA polymerase extension reaction to isolate DNA products for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. This nucleotide analog has a biotin moiety attached to the 5-position of 2'-deoxyribouridine 5'-triphosphate via a photocleavable 2-nitrobenzyl linker. We have demonstrated that dUTP-PC-Biotin can be faithfully incorporated by the DNA polymerase Thermo Sequenase into the growing DNA strand in a DNA polymerase extension reaction and that its incorporation does not hinder the addition of the subsequent nucleotide. Therefore, the DNA extension fragments generated by using the dUTP-PC-Biotin can be efficiently isolated by a streptavidin-coated surface and recovered by near-UV light irradiation at room temperature in mild condition for further analysis without using any chemicals or heat. Single and multiple primer extension reactions were performed using the dUTP-PC-Biotin to generate DNA products for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Such nucleotide analogs that carry a biotin and a photocleavable linker will allow the isolation and purification of DNA products under mild conditions for MS-based genetic analysis by DNA sequencing or multiplex single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection. Furthermore, these nucleotide analogs should also be useful in isolating DNA-protein complexes under non-denaturing conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Despite their clinical importance, the mechanism of action of the class C beta-lactamases is poorly understood. In contrast to the class A and class D beta-lactamases, which contain a glutamate residue and a carbamylated lysine in their respective active sites that are thought to serve as general base catalysts for beta-lactam hydrolysis, the mechanism of activation of the serine and water nucleophiles in the class C enzymes is unclear. To probe for residues involved in catalysis, the class C beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae P99 was studied by combinatorial scanning mutagenesis at 122 positions in and around the active site. Over 1000 P99 variants were screened for activity in a high-throughput in vivo antibiotic resistance assay and sequenced by 96-capillary electrophoresis to identify residues that are important for catalysis. P99 mutants showing reduced capability to convey antibiotic resistance were purified and characterized in vitro. The screen identified an active-site hydrogen-bonding network that is key to catalysis. A second cluster of residues was identified that likely plays a structural role in the enzyme. Otherwise, residues not directly contacting the substrate showed tolerance to substitution. The study lends support to the notion that the class C beta-lactamases do not have a single residue that acts as the catalytic general base. Rather, catalysis is affected by a hydrogen-bonding network in the active site, suggesting a possible charge relay system.",

        "Abstract": "We report the site-specific fluorescent labeling of DNA using Staudinger ligation with high efficiency and high selectivity. An oligonucleotide modified at its 5' end by an azido group was selectively reacted with 5-[(N-(3'-diphenylphosphinyl-4'-methoxycarbonyl)phenylcarbonyl)aminoacetamido]fluorescein (Fam) under aqueous conditions to produce a Fam-labeled oligonucleotide with a high yield (approximately 90%). The fluorescent oligonucleotide was characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Because of the relatively high yield of the Staudinger ligation, simple purification of the product by size-exclusion chromatography and desalting is sufficient for the resulting fluorescent oligonucleotide to be used as a primer in a Sanger dideoxy sequencing reaction to produce fluorescent DNA extension fragments, which are analyzed by a fluorescent electrophoresis DNA sequencer. The results indicate that the Staudinger ligation can be used successfully and site-specifically to prepare fluorescent oligonucleotides to produce DNA sequencing products, which are detected with single base resolution in a capillary electrophoresis DNA sequencer using laser-induced fluorescence detection.",

We report here the expanding of the SPC-SBE method as a single-tube assay to simultaneously detect 20 single nucleotide variations in a model system and 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) gene. Twenty primers were designed to have a sufficient mass difference between all extension products for accurate detection of nucleotide variants of the synthetic templates related to the p53 gene. These primers were extended simultaneously in a single tube with biotin-ddNTPs to generate 3(')-biotinylated DNA products, which were first captured by streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and then released from the beads and analyzed with MALDI-TOF MS. This approach generates a mass spectrum free of primer peaks and their associated dimers, increasing the scope of multiplexing SNPs. We also simultaneously genotyped 3 SNPs in the beta2AR gene (5(')LC-Cys19Arg, Gly16Arg, and Gln27Glu) from the genomic DNA of 20 individuals. Comparison of this approach with direct sequencing and the restriction fragment length polymorphism method indicated that the SPC-SBE method is superior for detecting nucleotide variations at known SNP sites.",

        "Abstract": "Three single-stranded DNA molecules of different lengths were synthesized and characterized, each containing a fluorescent dye (6-carboxyfluorescein) connected to the 5' end via a photocleavable 2-nitrobenzyl linker and a biotin moiety at the 3' end. UV irradiation (lambda approximately 340 nm) of solutions containing these fluorescent DNA molecules caused the complete cleavage of the nitrobenzyl linker, separating the fluorophore from the DNA. The photocleavage products were characterized by HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Our experimental results indicated that the proximity of the chromophore 6-carboxyfluorescein to the 2-nitrobenzyl linker did not hinder the quantitative photocleavage of the linker in the DNA molecules. The biotin moiety allowed immobilization of the fluorescent DNA on streptavidin-coated glass chips. The photocleavage of the immobilized DNA was investigated directly by fluorescence spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that close to 80% of the fluorophore was removed from the immobilized DNA after UV irradiation at 340 nm. These results strongly support the application of the 2-nitrobenzyl moiety as an efficient photocleavable linker, connecting fluorescent probes to DNA molecules for a variety of biological analyses such as DNA sequencing by synthesis.",

        "Title": "A photocleavable fluorescent nucleotide for DNA sequencing and analysis.",
        "Abstract": "DNA sequencing by synthesis during a polymerase reaction using laser-induced fluorescence detection is an approach that has a great potential to increase the throughput and data quality of DNA sequencing. We report the design and synthesis of a photocleavable fluorescent nucleoside triphosphate, one of the essential molecules required for the sequencing-by-synthesis approach. We synthesized this nucleoside triphosphate by attaching a fluorophore, 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3alpha,4alpha-diaza-s-indacene propionic acid (BODIPY), to the 5 position of 2'-deoxyuridine triphosphate via a photocleavable 2-nitrobenzyl linker. We demonstrate that the nucleotide analogue can be faithfully incorporated by a DNA polymerase Thermo Sequenase into the growing DNA strand in a DNA-sequencing reaction and that its incorporation does not hinder the addition of the subsequent nucleotide. These results indicate that the nucleotide analogue is an excellent substrate for Thermo Sequenase. We also systematically studied the photocleavage of the fluorescent dye from a DNA molecule that contained the nucleotide analogue. UV irradiation at 340 nm of the DNA molecule led to the efficient release of the fluorescent dye, ensuring that a previous fluorescence signal did not leave any residue that could interfere with the detection of the next nucleotide. Thus, our results indicate that it should be feasible to use four different fluorescent dyes with distinct fluorescence emissions as unique tags to label the four nucleotides (A, C, G, and T) through the photocleavable 2-nitrobenzyl linker. These fluorescent tags can be removed easily by photocleavage after the identification of each nucleotide in the DNA sequencing-by-synthesis approach.",

The procedure involves coupling fluorescence energy transfer (ET) primers that produce high fluorescent signals with solid-phase-capturable biotinylated dideoxynucleotides to generate Sanger DNA sequencing fragments. After the sequencing reaction,the DNA extension fragments that carry a biotin at the 3' end are captured with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, while the other components in the sequencing reaction are washed away. Only pure DNA extension products terminated by the biotinylated dideoxynucleotides are released from the magnetic beads and are loaded onto a sequencing gel to produce accurate sequencing data.",

        "Abstract": "We report an approach using solid phase capturable biotinylated dideoxynucleotides (biotin-ddNTPs) in single base extension for multiplex genotyping by mass spectrometry (MS). In this method, oligonucleotide primers that have different molecular weights and that are specific to the polymorphic sites in the DNA template are extended with biotin-ddNTPs by DNA polymerase to generate 3'-biotinylated DNA products. These products are then captured by streptavidin-coated solid phase magnetic beads, while the unextended primers and other components in the reaction are washed away. The pure extension DNA products are subsequently released from the solid phase and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS. The mass of the extension products is determined using a stable oligonucleotide as a common internal mass standard. Since only the pure extension DNA products are introduced to the MS for analysis, the resulting mass spectrum is free of non-extended primer peaks and their associated dimers, which increases the accuracy and scope of multiplexing in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. The solid phase purification approach also facilitates desalting of the captured oligonucleotides, which is essential for accurate mass measurement by MS. We selected four biotin-ddNTPs with distinct molecular weights to generate extension products that have a 2-fold increase in mass difference compared to that with conventional ddNTPs. This increase in mass difference provides improved resolution and accuracy in detecting heterozygotes in the mass spectrum. Using this method, we simultaneously distinguished six nucleotide variations on synthetic DNA templates mimicking mutations in the p53 gene and two disease-associated SNPs in the human hereditary hemochromatosis gene.",

We here describe a multiplex single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay based on single base extension (SBE) using CFET tags and biotinylated dideoxynucleotides (biotin-ddNTPs). A library of CFET-labeled oligonucleotide primers was mixed with biotin-ddNTPs, DNA polymerase and the DNA templates containing the SNPs in a single tube. The nucleotide at the 3'-end of each CFET-labeled oligonucleotide primer was complementary to a particular SNP in the template. Only the CFET-labeled primer that is fully complementary to the DNA template was extended by DNA polymerase with a biotin-ddNTP. We isolated the DNA extension fragments that carry a biotin at the 3'-end by capture with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, while the unextended primers were eliminated. The biotinylated fluorescent DNA fragments were subsequently analyzed in a multicolor fluorescence electrophoresis system. The distinct fluorescence signature and electrophoretic mobility of each DNA extension product in the electropherogram coded the SNPs without the use of a sizing standard. We simultaneously distinguished six nucleotide variations in synthetic DNA templates and a PCR product from the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene.
