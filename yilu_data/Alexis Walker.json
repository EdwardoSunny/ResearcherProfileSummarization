        "Title": "Racial Equity, Diversity and Inclusion in Bioethics: Recommendations from the Association of Bioethics Program Directors Presidential Task Force.",
        "Abstract": "Recent calls to address racism in bioethics reflect a sense of urgency to mitigate the lethal effects of a lack of action. While the field was catalyzed largely in response to pivotal events deeply rooted in racism and other structures of oppression embedded in research and health care, it has failed to center racial justice in its scholarship, pedagogy, advocacy, and practice, and neglected to integrate anti-racism as a central consideration. Academic bioethics programs play a key role in determining the field's norms and practices, including methodologies, funding priorities, and professional networks that bear on equity, inclusion, and epistemic justice. This article describes recommendations from the Racial Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (REDI) Task Force commissioned by the Association of Bioethics Program Directors to prioritize and strengthen anti-racist practices in bioethics programmatic endeavors and to evaluate and develop specific goals to advance REDI.",

        "Abstract": "Antibodies are engineerable quantities in medicine. Learning antibody molecular recognition would enable the in silico design of high affinity binders against nearly any proteinaceous surface. Yet, publicly available experiment antibody sequence-binding datasets may not contain the mutagenic, antigenic, or antibody sequence diversity necessary for deep learning approaches to capture molecular recognition. In part, this is because limited experimental platforms exist for assessing quantitative and simultaneous sequence-function relationships for multiple antibodies. Here we present MAGMA-seq, an integrated technology that combines multiple antigens and multiple antibodies and determines quantitative biophysical parameters using deep sequencing. We demonstrate MAGMA-seq on two pooled libraries comprising mutants of nine different human antibodies spanning light chain gene usage, CDR H3 length, and antigenic targets. We demonstrate the comprehensive mapping of potential antibody development pathways, sequence-binding relationships for multiple antibodies simultaneously, and identification of paratope sequence determinants for binding recognition for broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). MAGMA-seq enables rapid and scalable antibody engineering of multiple lead candidates because it can measure binding for mutants of many given parental antibodies in a single experiment.",

        "Abstract": "Biomedical research recruitment today focuses on including participants representative of global genetic variation-rightfully so. But ethnographic attention to practices of inclusion highlights how this agenda often transforms into \"predatory inclusion,\" simplistic pushes to get Black and brown people into genomic databases. As anthropologists of medicine, we argue that the question of how to get from diverse data to concrete benefit for people who are marginalized cannot be presumed to work itself out as a byproduct of diverse datasets. To actualize the equitable translation of genomics, practitioners need to place the impacts of ancestral genetic difference in the scope of much more impactful social determinants. For this to happen, multidisciplinary expertise needs to be leveraged, and current, structurally unequal health care systems ultimately need to transform. As modest steps toward this goal, new models for benefit-sharing must be developed and implemented to mitigate existing inequality between data donors and the entities profiting from that data.",

        "Title": "Hydrogen-Bonded Complexes in Binary Mixture of Imidazolium-Based Ionic Liquids with Organic Solvents.",
        "Abstract": "Though local structures in ionic liquids are dominated by strong Coulomb forces, directional hydrogen bonds can also influence the physicochemical properties of imidazolium-based ionic liquids. In particular, the C-2 position of the imidazolium cation is acidic and can bind with suitable hydrogen bond acceptor sites of molecular solvents dissolved in imidazolium-based ionic liquids. In this report, we identify hydrogen-bonded microenvironments of the model ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate, and the changes that occur when molecular solvents are dissolved in it by using a C-D infrared reporter at the C-2 position of the cation. Our linear and nonlinear infrared experiments, along with computational studies, indicate that the molecular solvent dimethyl sulfoxide can form strong hydrogen-bonded dimers with the cation of the ionic liquid at the C-2 position. In contrast, acetone, which is also a hydrogen bond acceptor similar to dimethyl sulfoxide, does not show evidence of cation-solvent hydrogen-bonded conformers at the C-2 position. The outcome of our study on a broad scale strengthens the importance of cation-solute interactions in ionic liquids.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper we explore a new technological intersection in the \"big data revolution\": the integration of two forms of data, genetic data and fitness tracking data. For example, a small number of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing companies have recently begun offering customers the ability to link their fitness tracking data with their genetic profile to get personalized diet and exercise recommendations. In this paper we put forward four ethical considerations that should inform potential uses of this health information. Those considerations are: the heightened risks to privacy resulting from combining sensitive data sets; the poor quality of health information that is possible at present in the realm of precision DTC genomics; the limited usefulness of the recommendations; and finally, the cultural assumptions about health and personal responsibility that are embedded within fitness genetic testing and fitness tracking. To conclude, we offer some guidance on how the benefits and risks of returning this type of health information can be weighed.",

As the global population of older adult continues to grow, motor vehicle crashes become more frequent among this demographic. Cognitive reserve (CR) is the brain's adaptability or functional robustness despite damage, while brain reserve (BR) refers the structural, neuroanatomical resources. This study examined whether CR and BR predicted changes in adverse driving behaviors in cognitively normal older adults. Cognitively normal older adults (Clinical Dementia Rating 0) were enrolled from longitudinal studies at the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University. Participants (",

        "Title": "Patterns in Benthic Microbial Community Structure Across Environmental Gradients in the Beaufort Sea Shelf and Slope.",
        "Abstract": "The paradigm of tight pelagic-benthic coupling in the Arctic suggests that current and future fluctuations in sea ice, primary production, and riverine input resulting from global climate change will have major impacts on benthic ecosystems. To understand how these changes will affect benthic ecosystem function, we must characterize diversity, spatial distribution, and community composition for all faunal components. Bacteria and archaea link the biotic and abiotic realms, playing important roles in organic matter (OM) decomposition, biogeochemical cycling, and contaminant degradation, yet sediment microbial communities have rarely been examined in the North American Arctic. Shifts in microbial community structure and composition occur with shifts in OM inputs and contaminant exposure, with implications for shifts in ecological function. Furthermore, the characterization of benthic microbial communities provides a foundation from which to build focused experimental research. We assessed diversity and community structure of benthic prokaryotes in the upper 1 cm of sediments in the southern Beaufort Sea (United States and Canada), and investigated environmental correlates of prokaryotic community structure over a broad spatial scale (spanning 1,229 km) at depths ranging from 17 to 1,200 m. Based on hierarchical clustering, we identified four prokaryotic assemblages from the 85 samples analyzed. Two were largely delineated by the markedly different environmental conditions in shallow shelf vs. upper continental slope sediments. A third assemblage was mainly comprised of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) shared between the shallow shelf and upper slope assemblages. The fourth assemblage corresponded to sediments receiving heavier OM loading, likely resulting in a shallower anoxic layer. These sites may also harbor microbial mats and/or methane seeps. Substructure within these assemblages generally reflected turnover along a longitudinal gradient, which may be related to the quantity and composition of OM deposited to the seafloor; bathymetry and the Mackenzie River were the two major factors influencing prokaryote distribution on this scale. In a broader geographical context, differences in prokaryotic community structure between the Beaufort Sea and Norwegian Arctic suggest that benthic microbes may reflect regional differences in the hydrography, biogeochemistry, and bathymetry of Arctic shelf systems.",

        "Abstract": "Rising prices for new, transformative therapies are challenging health systems around the world, leading many payers and providers to begin rationing access to treatments, even in the countries that have been most resistant to doing so. This is the case for direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, little attention has been paid to the increasing role that human genetics might play in rationing decisions. Researchers have already proposed that genetic markers associated with spontaneous HCV clearance could be used to restrict DAA access for some patients, although treatment would be medically beneficial for those patients. Would such forms of rationing present a form of genetic discrimination? And what of the public health implications of these approaches? Here we present an ethical analysis of such proposals for \"precision rationing\" and raise 4 key areas of concern. We argue that ethical issues arising in this area are not substantively different from the pressing ethical issues regarding rationing and discrimination more broadly, but provide important impetus for motivating broad public debate to find ethically sound ways of managing genomics and new expensive medications.",

For instance, individuals' genetic susceptibility or resistance to infectious disease is likely to affect disease transmission. Yet little attention has been paid to the ethical, legal, and social implications of research in genomics and infectious disease, despite the unique ethical issues that arise in this arena. This article presents results from a pilot study exploring ethics in research on human genetics and response to HIV and other infectious diseases and is focused on perspectives from expert stakeholders. Whereas chairs of institutional review boards, biobank directors, and researchers in genomics and infectious disease expressed similar views about research privacy in the context of a public health emergency, they expressed different perspectives about the role that public health considerations ought to play in the return of individual results to research participants. These perspectives highlight the need to emphasize the importance of broad dialogue for helping various parties navigate the ethically complex current and future challenges of genomics and infectious disease research.",

        "Abstract": "Since the early 1990s, the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank have led efforts advocating the use of economic tools in setting priorities for health spending in poor countries. But while these powerful global health institutions present economic management as the key to improving health, they often fail to implement even their own policies requiring the use of economic tools for health project planning. In these institutions, economic tools operate beyond application for decision-making, becoming simultaneously a site of tensions regarding sovereignty and sites of enjoyment for economists at development bank headquarters. This article traces the ways that economic tools are both deployed and left aside across development bank networks, and in the process are productive of both affect and power. Attention to frictions in the use of economic tools ought to help motivate more just global health governance, taking into account political considerations that are built into expert practice.",

        "Abstract": "In oral history interviews, Guyanese healthcare workers emphasize continuity in public health governance throughout the late twentieth century, despite major shifts in broader systems of governance during this period. I argue that these healthcare workers' recollections reflect long-term scarcities and the discourses through which both socialist politicians and neoliberal reformers have narrated them. I highlight the striking similarities in discourses of responsibility and efficiency advanced by socialist politicians in 1970s Guyana and by World Bank representatives designing the country's market transition in the late 1980s, and the ways these discourses have played out in Guyana's health system. Across diverging ideologies, politicians and administrators have promoted severe cost-control as the means to a more prosperous future, presenting short-term pains as necessary to creating new, better, leaner ways of life. In the health sector this has been enacted through a focus on self-help, and on nutrition as a tool available without funds dedicated for pharmaceuticals, advanced medical technologies, or a fully staffed public health system. I argue that across these periods Guyanese citizens have been offered a very similar recipe of ongoing sacrifice. I base my analysis on oral histories with forty-six healthcare workers conducted between 2013 and 2015 in Guyana in Regions 3, 4, 5, 9, and 10, as well as written records from World Bank and Guyanese national archives; I analyze official discourses as well as recollections and experiences of public health governance by those working in Guyana's health system.",

        "Abstract": "Like many species, the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits multiple different life histories in natural environments. We grew mutants impaired in different signaling pathways in field experiments across the species' native European range in order to dissect the mechanisms underlying this variation. Unexpectedly, mutational loss at loci implicated in the cold requirement for flowering had little effect on life history except in late-summer cohorts. A genetically informed photothermal model of progression toward flowering explained most of the observed variation and predicted an abrupt transition from autumn flowering to spring flowering in late-summer germinants. Environmental signals control the timing of this transition, creating a critical window of acute sensitivity to genetic and climatic change that may be common for seasonally regulated life history traits.",

        "Abstract": "The death of a child is a traumatic, nonnormative family life event. Although parental bereavement has received substantial attention, little research has focused on extended family members affected by a child's death, and still less on how multiple family members perceive and respond to one another following the loss. Guided by a life course perspective, this article examines social support between grandparents and their adult children in the aftermath of infant death. Through structured, open-ended interviews, 21 grandparents and 19 parents from 10 families described how they provided support to and received support from their intergenerational partners. Data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Six categories of support were identified: being present, acknowledgment, performing immediate tasks, information, unskilled support, and no support. Most support was provided by grandparents to adult children rather than from adult children to grandparents. All families reported significant support from at least one grandparent and nearly all families described ambivalent relationships that complicated support. Gender, family lineage, and family history were major influences. Multiple family perspectives about a significant life event contribute to our understanding about the intersection between individual and family life.",
