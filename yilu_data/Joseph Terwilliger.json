        "Abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the predominant subtype of esophageal cancer in Central Asia, often diagnosed at advanced stages. Understanding population-specific patterns of ESCC is crucial for tailored treatments. This study aimed to unravel ESCC's genetic basis in Kazakhstani patients and identify potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and targeted therapies. ESCC patients from Kazakhstan were studied. We analyzed histological subtypes and conducted in-depth transcriptome sequencing. Differential gene expression analysis was performed, and significantly dysregulated pathways were identified using KEGG pathway analysis (",

        "Abstract": "Weight loss and increased physical activity may promote beneficial modulation of the metabolome, but limited evidence exists about how very low-level weight loss affects the metabolome in previously non-obese active individuals. Following a weight loss period (21.1 \u00b1 3.1 weeks) leading to substantial fat mass loss of 52% (\u22127.9 \u00b1 1.5 kg) and low body fat (12.7 \u00b1 4.1%), the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolic signature of 24 previously young, healthy, and normal weight female physique athletes was investigated. We observed uniform increases (FDR < 0.05) in bile acids, very-long-chain free fatty acids (FFA), and oxylipins, together with reductions in unsaturated FFAs after weight loss. These widespread changes, especially in the bile acid profile, were most strongly explained (FDR < 0.05) by changes in android (visceral) fat mass. The reported changes did not persist, as all of them were reversed after the subsequent voluntary weight regain period (18.4 \u00b1 2.9 weeks) and were unchanged in non-dieting controls (n = 16). Overall, we suggest that the reported changes in FFA, bile acid, and oxylipin profiles reflect metabolic adaptation to very low levels of fat mass after prolonged periods of intense exercise and low-energy availability. However, the effects of the aforementioned metabolome subclass alteration on metabolic homeostasis remain controversial, and more studies are warranted to unravel the complex physiology and potentially associated health implications. In the end, our study reinforced the view that transient weight loss seems to have little to no long-lasting molecular and physiological effects.",

        "Abstract": "Kazakhstan, the ninth-largest country in the world, is located along the Great Silk Road and connects Europe with Asia. Historically, its territory has been inhabited by nomadic tribes, and modern-day Kazakhstan is a multiethnic country with a dominant Kazakh population. We sequenced and analyzed the genomes of five ethnic Kazakhs at high coverage using the Illumina HiSeq2000 next-generation sequencing platform. The five Kazakhs yielded a total number of base pairs ranging from 87,308,581,400 to 107,526,741,301. On average, 99.06% were properly mapped. Based on the Het/Hom and Ti/Tv ratios, the quality of the genomic data ranged from 1.35 to 1.49 and from 2.07 to 2.08, respectively. Genetic variants were identified and annotated. Functional analysis of the genetic variants identified several variants that were associated with higher risks of metabolic and neurogenerative diseases. The present study showed high levels of genetic admixture of Kazakhs that were comparable to those of other Central Asians. These whole-genome sequence data of healthy Kazakhs could contribute significantly to biomedical studies of common diseases as their findings could allow better insight into the genotype-phenotype relations at the population level.",

We investigated the association of normal-tension GON with or without visual field defects with reading-to reading variability of 24-h MAP, as captured by variability independent of the MAP level (VIM",

        "Abstract": "Venezuela is in the throes of a complex humanitarian crisis that is one of the worst in decades to impact any country outside of wartime. This case analysis describes the challenges faced by the ongoing Maracaibo Aging Study (MAS) during the deteriorating conditions in Venezuela. When the MAS began in 1997, it focused on memory-related disorders. Since then, strategic planning and proactive community participation allowed us to anticipate and address logistical, funding, and ethical challenges, and facilitated the enrollment and retention of more than 2500 subjects over 55\u2009years of age. All participants, who are residents of the city of Maracaibo, Venezuela, underwent various assessments on several occasions. Here, we discuss how our approach to implementing a longitudinal, population-based study of age-related conditions has allowed our research program to continue throughout this period of political, economic, and social upheaval.",

        "Abstract": "Exercise and exercise-induced weight loss have a beneficial effect on overall health, including positive effects on molecular pathways associated with immune function, especially in overweight individuals. The main aim of our study was to assess how energy deprivation (i.e., \"semi-starvation\") leading to substantial fat mass loss affects the immune system and immunosuppression in previously normal weight individuals. Thus, to address this hypothesis, we applied a high-throughput systems biology approach to better characterize potential key pathways associated with immune system modulation during intensive weight loss and subsequent weight regain. We examined 42 healthy female physique athletes (age 27.5 \u00b1 4.0 years, body mass index 23.4 \u00b1 1.7 kg/m",

        "Abstract": "Higher physical activity is associated with a reduced hazard for a plethora of diseases. It has remained unknown how the two primary physical activity-associated health effects, improved physical performance and change in body composition, independently modulate metabolic profiles toward a reduced risk for adverse outcomes. Here, we utilized a prospective cohort of 664 young men undergoing military service. We studied the metabolic associations of changes in muscle performance and body composition during military service (range 6-12 mo). We subsequently replicated our results for body composition change in 234 population-based samples with a 7-yr follow-up. We found that increased physical performance was associated with reduced very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-related measures [change in VLDL cholesterol: beta\u2009=\u2009-0.135; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u2009-0.217, -0.054, P = 1.2 \u00d7 10",

        "Abstract": "Acrophobia, an abnormal fear of heights, is a specific phobia characterized as apprehension cued by the occurrence or anticipation of elevated spaces. It is considered a complex trait with onset influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Identification of genetic risk variants would provide novel insight into the genetic basis of the fear of heights phenotype and contribute to the molecular-level understanding of its aetiology. Genetic isolates may facilitate identification of susceptibility alleles due to reduced genetic heterogeneity. We took advantage of an internal genetic isolate in Finland in which a distinct acrophobia phenotype appears to be segregating in pedigrees originally ascertained for schizophrenia. We conducted parametric, nonparametric, joint linkage and linkage disequilibrium analyses using a microsatellite marker panel, genotyped in families to search for chromosomal regions correlated with acrophobia. Our results implicated a few regions with suggestive evidence for linkage on chromosomes 4q28 (LOD\u2009=\u20092.17), 8q24 (LOD\u2009=\u20092.09) and 13q21-q22 (LOD\u2009=\u20092.22). We observed no risk haplotypes shared between different families. These results suggest that genetic predisposition to acrophobia in this genetic isolate is unlikely to be mediated by a small number of shared high-risk alleles, but rather has a complex genetic architecture.",

For the purpose of a gene mapping study, several pedigrees were ascertained with multiple affected family members. Seventeen families with a total of 71 individuals (including 45 affected or possibly affected) were recruited at clinical centers in 7 countries under the auspices of the MacTel Project. The disease inheritance was consistent with autosomal dominant segregation with reduced penetrance. Genome-wide linkage analysis was performed, followed by analysis of recombination breakpoints. Linkage analysis identified a single peak with multi-point LOD score of 3.45 on chromosome 1 at 1q41-42 under a dominant model. Recombination mapping defined a minimal candidate region of 15.6 Mb, from 214.32 (rs1579634; 219.96 cM) to 229.92 Mb (rs7542797; 235.07 cM), encompassing the 1q41-42 linkage peak. Sanger sequencing of the top 14 positional candidates genes under the linkage peak revealed no causal variants in these pedigrees.",

        "Abstract": "It has been shown that parametric analysis of linkage disequilibrium conditional on linkage using an overly deterministic model can be optimal for family-based association analysis. However, if one applies this strategy carelessly, there is a risk of false inference. We analyse properties of such likelihood ratio tests when the assumed disease mode of inheritance is inaccurate. Under some conditions, problems result if one is not careful to consider what null hypothesis is being tested. We show that: (a) tests for which the null hypothesis assumes the absence of both linkage and association are independent of the true mode of inheritance; (b) likelihood ratio tests assuming either linkage or association under the null hypothesis may depend on the true mode of inheritance, leading to inconsistent parameter estimates, in particular under extremely deterministic models; (c) this problem cannot be eliminated by increasing sample size or adding population controls--as sample size increases, the chance of false positive inference goes to 100%; (d) this issue can lead to systematic false positive inference of association in regions of linkage. This is important because highly deterministic models are often used intentionally in model-based analyses because they can have more power than the true model, and are implicit in many model-free analysis methods.",

        "Title": "On the statistical properties of family-based association tests in datasets containing both pedigrees and unrelated case-control samples.",
        "Abstract": "A common approach to genetic mapping of loci for complex diseases is to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) by analyzing a vast number of SNP markers in cohorts of unrelated cases and controls. A direct motivation for the case-control design is that unrelated, affected individuals can be easier to collect than large families with multiple affected persons in the Western world. Despite its higher potential power, investigators have not actively pursued family ascertainment in part because of a dearth of methods for analyzing such correlated data on a large scale. We examine the statistical properties of several commonly used family-based association tests, as to their performance using real-life mixtures of families and singletons taken from our own migraine and schizophrenia studies, as well as population-based data for a complex trait simulated with the evolutionary phenogenetic simulator, ForSim. In virtually every situation, the full likelihood-based methods in the PSEUDOMARKER program outperformed those implemented in FBAT, GENEHUNTER TDT, PLINK (family-based options), HRR/HHRR, QTDT, TRANSMIT, UNPHASED, MENDEL, and LAMP. We further show that GWAS is much more powerful when family samples are used rather than unrelateds, on a genotype-by-genotype basis.",

        "Abstract": "A decade ago, there was widespread enthusiasm for the prospects of genome-wide association studies to identify common variants related to common chronic diseases using samples of unrelated individuals from populations. Although technological advancements allow us to query more than a million SNPs across the genome at low cost, a disappointingly small fraction of the genetic portion of common disease etiology has been uncovered. This has led to the hypothesis that less frequent variants might be involved, stimulating a renaissance of the traditional approach of seeking genes using multiplex families from less diverse populations. However, by using the modern genotyping and sequencing technology, we can now look not just at linkage, but jointly at linkage and linkage disequilibrium (LD) in such samples. Software methods that can look simultaneously at linkage and LD in a powerful and robust manner have been lacking. Most algorithms cannot jointly analyze datasets involving families of varying structures in a statistically or computationally efficient manner. We have implemented previously proposed statistical algorithms in a user-friendly software package, PSEUDOMARKER. This paper is an announcement of this software package. We describe the motivation behind the approach, the statistical methods, and software, and we briefly demonstrate PSEUDOMARKER's advantages over other packages by example.",

        "Abstract": "Twin, adoption, and family studies have established the heritability of suicide attempts and suicide. Identifying specific suicide diathesis-related genes has proven more difficult. As with psychiatric disorders in general, methodological difficulties include complexity of the phenotype for suicidal behavior and distinguishing suicide diathesis-related genes from genes associated with mood disorders and other suicide-associated psychiatric illness. Adopting an endophenotype approach involving identification of genes associated with heritable intermediate phenotypes, including biological and/or behavioral markers more proximal to genes, is an approach being used for other psychiatric disorders. Therefore, a workshop convened by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University, and the National Institute of Mental Health sought to identify potential target endophenotypes for genetic studies of suicidal behavior. The most promising endophenotypes were trait aggression/impulsivity, early-onset major depression, neurocognitive function, and cortisol social stress response. Other candidate endophenotypes requiring further investigation include serotonergic neurotransmission, second messenger systems, and borderline personality disorder traits.",

        "Abstract": "Etiological heterogeneity and complexity has hampered attempts to identify predisposing genes for schizophrenia. We sought to minimize the number of segregating genes involved by focusing on a population isolate with elevated disease prevalence. We exploited the well-established population history, and searched for disease susceptibility loci in families from two alternative founder lineages. We studied 28 schizophrenia pedigrees (123 nuclear families) from an outlying municipality on the eastern border of Finland. We divided the families based on their genealogy and defined two routes of immigration: southern and northern. We examined the kinship coefficients and allele frequency distributions within each group, and performed a linkage analysis based on 497 microsatellite markers across the genome. A high degree of historical relatedness was demonstrated by higher sharing of alleles than predicted by the relationships we identified within the previous four generations alone, as would be expected. Between the two subpopulations, allele frequencies were significantly different, consistent with their isolated genealogies. The southern families showed some evidence of linkage in a schizophrenia locus at 4q23 (Z = 3.3) near our previous finding with quantitative variation in verbal learning and memory [Paunio et al. (2004); Hum Mol Genet 13: 1693-1702], while the northern pedigrees gave most significant evidence on 10q21 (Z = 2.53). Joint analysis of families from both lineages suggested evidence of linkage only at 3p14 (Z = 3.18). Thus the detailed genealogical information led us to identification of distinct linkage signals for schizophrenia susceptibility loci between the three analyses we performed.",

        "Title": "Consistently replicating locus linked to migraine on 10q22-q23.",
        "Abstract": "Here, we present the results of two genome-wide scans in two diverse populations in which a consistent use of recently introduced migraine-phenotyping methods detects and replicates a locus on 10q22-q23, with an additional independent replication. No genetic variants have been convincingly established in migraine, and although several loci have been reported, none of them has been consistently replicated. We employed the three known migraine-phenotyping methods (clinical end diagnosis, latent-class analysis, and trait-component analysis) with robust multiple testing correction in a large sample set of 1675 individuals from 210 migraine families from Finland and Australia. Genome-wide multipoint linkage analysis that used the Kong and Cox exponential model in Finns detected a locus on 10q22-q23 with highly significant evidence of linkage (LOD 7.68 at 103 cM in female-specific analysis). The Australian sample showed a LOD score of 3.50 at the same locus (100 cM), as did the independent Finnish replication study (LOD score 2.41, at 102 cM). In addition, four previously reported loci on 8q21, 14q21, 18q12, and Xp21 were also replicated. A shared-segment analysis of 10q22-q23 linked Finnish families identified a 1.6-9.5 cM segment, centered on 101 cM, which shows in-family homology in 95% of affected Finns. This region was further studied with 1323 SNPs. Although no significant association was observed, four regions warranting follow-up studies were identified. These results support the use of symptomology-based phenotyping in migraine and suggest that the 10q22-q23 locus probably contains one or more migraine susceptibility variants.",

        "Abstract": "A single-nucleotide variant, C/T(-13910), located 14 kb upstream of the lactase gene (LCT), has been shown to be completely correlated with lactase persistence (LP) in northern Europeans. Here, we analyzed the background of the alleles carrying the critical variant in 1,611 DNA samples from 37 populations. Our data show that the T(-13910) variant is found on two different, highly divergent haplotype backgrounds in the global populations. The first is the most common LP haplotype (LP H98) present in all populations analyzed, whereas the others (LP H8-H12), which originate from the same ancestral allelic haplotype, are found in geographically restricted populations living west of the Urals and north of the Caucasus. The global distribution pattern of LP T(-13910) H98 supports the Caucasian origin of this allele. Age estimates based on different mathematical models show that the common LP T(-13910) H98 allele (approximately 5,000-12,000 years old) is relatively older than the other geographically restricted LP alleles (approximately 1,400-3,000 years old). Our data about global allelic haplotypes of the lactose-tolerance variant imply that the T(-13910) allele has been independently introduced more than once and that there is a still-ongoing process of convergent evolution of the LP alleles in humans.",

        "Abstract": "We have previously reported a robust association between an allelic haplotype of 'Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1' (DISC1) and schizophrenia in a nationwide collection of Finnish schizophrenia families. This specific DISC1 allele was later identified to associate with visual working memory, selectively in males. DISC1 association to schizophrenia has since been replicated in multiple independent study samples from different populations. In this study, we conditioned our sample of Finnish families for the presence of the Finnish tentative risk allele for DISC1 and re-analyzed our genome-wide scan data of 443 markers on the basis of this stratification. Two additional loci displayed an evidence of linkage (LOD > 3) and included a locus on 16p13, proximal to the gene encoding NDE1, which has been shown to biologically interact with DISC1. Although none of the observed linkages remained significant after multiple test correction through simulation, further analysis of NDE1 revealed an association between a tag-haplotype and schizophrenia (P = 0.00046) specific to females, which proved to be significant (P = 0.011) after multiple test correction. Our finding would support the concept that initial gene findings in multifactorial diseases will assist in the identification of other components of complex genetic etiology. Notably, this and other converging lines of evidence underline the importance of DISC1-related functional pathways in the etiology of schizophrenia.",

        "Title": "An utter refutation of the \"fundamental theorem of the HapMap\".",
        "Abstract": "The International HapMap Project was proposed in order to quantify linkage disequilibrium (LD) relationships among human DNA polymorphisms in an assortment of populations, in order to facilitate the process of selecting a minimal set of markers that could capture most of the signal from the untyped markers in a genome-wide association study. The central dogma can be summarized by the argument that if a marker is in tight LD with a polymorphism that directly impacts disease risk, as measured by the metric r(2), then one would be able to detect an association between the marker and disease with sample size that was increased by a factor of 1/r(2) over that needed to detect the effect of the functional variant directly. This \"fundamental theorem\" holds, however, only if one assumes that the LD between loci and the etiological effect of the functional variant are independent of each other, that they are statistically independent of all other etiological factors (in exposure and action), that sampling is prospective, and that the estimates of r(2) are accurate. None of these are standard operating assumptions, however. We describe the ramifications of these implicit assumptions, and provide simple examples in which the effects of a functional variant could be unequivocally detected if it were directly genotyped, even as markers in high LD with the functional variant would never show association with disease, even in infinite sample sizes. Both theoretical and empirical refutation of the central dogma of genome-wide association studies is thus presented.",

        "Abstract": "NEU (ERBB2) and other members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family have been implicated in human prostate cancer (CAP) development and progression to an androgen-independent state, but the extent of involvement and precise role of this signaling pathway remain unclear. To begin addressing such open questions in an animal model, we have developed a transgenic line in which an oncogenic Neu cDNA (Neu*) driven by the probasin gene promoter is overexpressed in the mouse prostate and causes development of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) that progresses to invasive carcinoma. Expression profiling using microarrays, which was selectively validated and extended by immunophenotyping of Neu*-induced PIN and CAP, led to the identification of some novel biomarkers and also revealed increased expression of Egfr, Erbb3 and phosphorylated androgen receptor. In view of this information from our mouse model, which can be used to analyze further the role of Erbb signaling in prostatic tumorigenesis, we examined human prostate cancer tissue arrays by immunohistochemistry. Based on statistical analyses of the results, we propose the testable hypothesis that ERBB3, shown to be expressed in 86% of the human CAP cases that we examined, is the pivotal element of the Erbb pathway promoting tumorigenesis by heterodimerization with NEU or EGFR, while a NEU/EGFR dimer does not appear to play a significant role in CAP.",

Different linkage analysis programs require different input file formats, making the task of analyzing data with multiple methods even more time-consuming. We have developed a software tool, AUTOGSCAN, that automates file formatting, the running of statistical analyses, and the summarizing of resulting statistics for whole genome scans with a push of a button, using several independent, and often idiosyncratic, statistical software packages such as MERLIN, SOLAR and GENEHUNTER. We also describe a program, ANALYZE, designed to run qualitative linkage analysis with several different statistical strategies and programs to efficiently screen for linkage and linkage disequilibrium for a given discrete trait. The ANALYZE program can also be used by AUTOGSCAN in a genome-wide sense.",

        "Title": "Integrative annotation of 21,037 human genes validated by full-length cDNA clones.",
        "Abstract": "The human genome sequence defines our inherent biological potential; the realization of the biology encoded therein requires knowledge of the function of each gene. Currently, our knowledge in this area is still limited. Several lines of investigation have been used to elucidate the structure and function of the genes in the human genome. Even so, gene prediction remains a difficult task, as the varieties of transcripts of a gene may vary to a great extent. We thus performed an exhaustive integrative characterization of 41,118 full-length cDNAs that capture the gene transcripts as complete functional cassettes, providing an unequivocal report of structural and functional diversity at the gene level. Our international collaboration has validated 21,037 human gene candidates by analysis of high-quality full-length cDNA clones through curation using unified criteria. This led to the identification of 5,155 new gene candidates. It also manifested the most reliable way to control the quality of the cDNA clones. We have developed a human gene database, called the H-Invitational Database (H-InvDB; http://www.h-invitational.jp/). It provides the following: integrative annotation of human genes, description of gene structures, details of novel alternative splicing isoforms, non-protein-coding RNAs, functional domains, subcellular localizations, metabolic pathways, predictions of protein three-dimensional structure, mapping of known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), identification of polymorphic microsatellite repeats within human genes, and comparative results with mouse full-length cDNAs. The H-InvDB analysis has shown that up to 4% of the human genome sequence (National Center for Biotechnology Information build 34 assembly) may contain misassembled or missing regions. We found that 6.5% of the human gene candidates (1,377 loci) did not have a good protein-coding open reading frame, of which 296 loci are strong candidates for non-protein-coding RNA genes. In addition, among 72,027 uniquely mapped SNPs and insertions/deletions localized within human genes, 13,215 nonsynonymous SNPs, 315 nonsense SNPs, and 452 indels occurred in coding regions. Together with 25 polymorphic microsatellite repeats present in coding regions, they may alter protein structure, causing phenotypic effects or resulting in disease. The H-InvDB platform represents a substantial contribution to resources needed for the exploration of human biology and pathology.",

        "Abstract": "Many promises have been made about the impact of the Human Genome Project on clinical practice and public health, yet despite massively funded efforts over the past decade, little headway has been made in elucidating the specific genetic factors which have major impact on the risk of developing common complex traits. There are two fundamental reasons for this abject failure as follows: 1) studies have been inadequately designed to identify such genetic risk factors; 2) the genetic factors that do exist are individually of small marginal importance, and are characterized by extensive heterogeneity. If 2) is the truth, there is little we can do about it, so we emphasize the importance of 1) in this article, while recognizing that 2) probably is not far from the truth. Genetic studies, in contrast to epidemiological studies, use confounding and ascertainment bias to help identify weak etiologic signal due to genes, since gene mapping is fundamentally a hypothesis-free science. This strategy makes it possible to identify genetic risk factors, but makes it impossible to quantify the size of their effect on risk. Classical epidemiological study designs are of minimal value for gene identification, but may be of use in estimation of the effect size of genetic risk factors once they are identified in more appropriately designed genetic studies. However, if the effects are so weak that we need this strong, systematic ascertainment bias to find them, their relevance to public health may be of questionable immediate value, raising many questions about the rhetoric and promises being made to the public as justification for 'big science' approaches to dissecting the hypothetical role of genes in complex traits.",

        "Title": "A genomewide screen of 345 families for autism-susceptibility loci.",
        "Abstract": "We previously reported a genomewide scan to identify autism-susceptibility loci in 110 multiplex families, showing suggestive evidence (P <.01) for linkage to autism-spectrum disorders (ASD) on chromosomes 5, 8, 16, 19, and X and showing nominal evidence (P <.05) on several additional chromosomes (2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, and 20). In this follow-up analysis we have increased the sample size threefold, while holding the study design constant, so that we now report 345 multiplex families, each with at least two siblings affected with autism or ASD phenotype. Along with 235 new multiplex families, 73 new microsatellite markers were also added in 10 regions, thereby increasing the marker density at these strategic locations from 10 cM to approximately 2 cM and bringing the total number of markers to 408 over the entire genome. Multipoint maximum LOD scores (MLS) obtained from affected-sib-pair analysis of all 345 families yielded suggestive evidence for linkage on chromosomes 17, 5, 11, 4, and 8 (listed in order by MLS) (P <.01). The most significant findings were an MLS of 2.83 (P =.00029) on chromosome 17q, near the serotonin transporter (5-hydroxytryptamine transporter [5-HTT]), and an MLS of 2.54 (P =.00059) on 5p. The present follow-up genome scan, which used a consistent research design across studies and examined the largest ASD sample collection reported to date, gave either equivalent or marginally increased evidence for linkage at several chromosomal regions implicated in our previous scan but eliminated evidence for linkage at other regions.",

        "Abstract": "Linkage disequilibrium (LD) has been an efficient tool for fine mapping of monogenic disease genes in population isolates. Its usefulness for identification of predisposing loci for common, polygenic diseases has been challenged on the basis of anticipated allelic and locus heterogeneity. We compared the extent of LD among marker loci in Finnish subpopulations with divergent but well-characterized histories. One study sample represents the early settlement Finnish population, descended from two immigration events 4,000 and 2,000 years ago. The second sample represents the geographically large late settlement region, populated 15 generations ago by several small immigrant groups from the early settlement region. The third is a restricted regional subpopulation in northeastern Finland which was founded 12 generations ago by 39 immigrant families from the late settlement region. We genotyped 243 microsatellite markers and 68 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosomes 1q and 5q. The genealogy of the families from the early (n=16) and late settlements (n=54) and the isolated settlement (n=54) was studied in detail back to the 1800s. Microsatellite data revealed greater LD in the young, founder subpopulation than was seen in either of the older populations. Observed linkage disequilibrium correlated not only with physical distance between markers but also with the information content of the markers. Using biallelic SNP markers, significant LD could only be detected up to 0.1 cM. Our results demonstrate the complexity of the concept of 'detectable LD' and emphasize the importance of understanding population history when designing a strategy for disease gene mapping.",

        "Abstract": "Although many biotechnological advancements have been made in the past decade, there has been very limited success in unraveling the genetic component of complex traits. Heavily invested research has been initiated based on etiological models of unrealistic simplicity and conducted under poor experimental designs, on data sets of insufficient size, leading to an overestimation of the effect sizes of genetic variants and the quantity and quality of linkage disequilibrium (LD). Arguments about whether families or unrelated individuals provide more power for gene mapping have been erroneously debated as issues of whether linkage or LD are more detectable sorts of correlation. Although the latter issue may be subject to debate, there is no doubt that family-based analysis is more powerful for detecting linkage and/or LD. If the recent advances in biotechnology are to be exploited effectively, vastly improved study designs will be imperative, as the reasons for the lack of success to date have much more to do with biology than technology, an issue that has become increasingly clear with the findings of the past years.",

        "Title": "Identification of a variant associated with adult-type hypolactasia.",
        "Abstract": "Adult-type hypolactasia, also known as lactase non-persistence (lactose intolerance), is a common autosomal recessive condition resulting from the physiological decline in activity of the lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) in intestinal cells after weaning. LPH hydrolyzes lactose into glucose and galactose. Sequence analyses of the coding and promoter regions of LCT, the gene encoding LPH, has revealed no DNA variations correlating with lactase non-persistence. An associated haplotype spanning LCT, as well as a distinct difference in the transcript levels of 'non-persistence' and 'persistence' alleles in heterozygotes, suggest that a cis-acting element contributes to the lactase non-persistence phenotype. Using linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analysis of nine extended Finnish families, we restricted the locus to a 47-kb interval on 2q21. Sequence analysis of the complete region and subsequent association analyses revealed that a DNA variant, C/T-13910, roughly 14 kb upstream from the LCT locus, completely associates with biochemically verified lactase non-persistence in Finnish families and a sample set of 236 individuals from four different populations. A second variant, G/A-22018, 8 kb telomeric to C/T-13910, is also associated with the trait in 229 of 236 cases. Prevalence of the C/T-13910 variant in 1,047 DNA samples is consistent with the reported prevalence of adult-type hypolactasia in four different populations. That the variant (C/T-13910) occurs in distantly related populations indicates that it is very old.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CD), or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is a common multifactorial disorder resulting from intolerance to cereal prolamins. The only established genetic susceptibility factor is HLA-DQ, which appears to explain only part of the overall genetic risk. We performed a genomewide scan of CD in 60 Finnish families. In addition to strong evidence for linkage to the HLA region at 6p21.3 (Z(max)>5), suggestive evidence for linkage was found for six other chromosomal regions--1p36, 4p15, 5q31, 7q21, 9p21-23, and 16q12. We further analyzed the three most convincing regions--4p15, 5q31, and 7q21--by evaluation of dense marker arrays across each region and by analysis of an additional 38 families. Although multipoint analysis with dense markers provided supportive evidence (multipoint LOD scores 3.25 at 4p15, 1.49 at 5q31, and 1.04 at 7q21) for the initial findings, the additional 38 families did not strengthen evidence for linkage. The role that HLA-DQ plays was studied in more detail by analysis of DQB1 alleles in all 98 families. All but one patient carried one or two HLA-DQ risk alleles, and 65% of HLA-DQ2 carriers were affected. Our study indicates that the HLA region harbors a predominant CD-susceptibility locus in these Finnish families.",
