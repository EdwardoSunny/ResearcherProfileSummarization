        "Abstract": "Disordered chromatin organization has emerged as a new aspect of the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Characterized by lineage dysplasia and a high transformation rate to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the genetic determinant of MDS is thought to be the main driver of the disease's progression. Among the recurrently mutated pathways, alterations in chromatin organization, such as the cohesin complex, have a profound impact on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and lineage commitment. The cohesin complex is a ring-like structure comprised of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC), RAD21, and STAG proteins that involve three-dimensional (3D) genome organization via loop extrusion in mammalian cells. The partial loss of the functional cohesin ring leads to altered chromatin accessibility specific to key hematopoietic transcription factors, which is thought to be the molecular mechanism of cohesin dysfunction. Currently, there are no specific targeting agents for cohesin mutant MDS/AML. Potential therapeutic strategies have been proposed based on the current understanding of cohesin mutant leukemogenesis. Here, we will review the recent advances in investigation and targeting approaches against cohesin mutant MDS/AML.",

        "Abstract": "Yin Yang 1 (YY1) and structural maintenance of chromosomes 3 (SMC3) are 2 critical chromatin structural factors that mediate long-distance enhancer-promoter interactions and promote developmentally regulated changes in chromatin architecture in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Although YY1 has critical functions in promoting hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and maintaining HSC quiescence, SMC3 is required for proper myeloid lineage differentiation. However, many questions remain unanswered regarding how YY1 and SMC3 interact with each other and affect hematopoiesis. We found that YY1 physically interacts with SMC3 and cooccupies with SMC3 at a large cohort of promoters genome wide, and YY1 deficiency deregulates the genetic network governing cell metabolism. YY1 occupies the Smc3 promoter and represses SMC3 expression in HSPCs. Although deletion of 1 Smc3 allele partially restores HSC numbers and quiescence in YY1 knockout mice, Yy1-/-Smc3+/- HSCs fail to reconstitute blood after bone marrow transplant. YY1 regulates HSC metabolic pathways and maintains proper intracellular reactive oxygen species levels in HSCs, and this regulation is independent of the YY1-SMC3 axis. Our results establish a distinct YY1-SMC3 axis and its impact on HSC quiescence and metabolism.",

        "Abstract": "Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an entity hallmarked by skewed hematopoiesis with persistent overrepresentation of cells from a common stem/progenitor lineage harboring single-nucleotide variants and/or insertions/deletions. CH is a common and age-related phenomenon that is associated with an increased risk of hematological malignancies, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. While CH is a term of the hematological aspect, there exists a complex interaction with other organ systems, especially the cardiovascular system. The strongest factor in the development of CH is aging, however, other multiple factors also affect the development of CH including lifestyle-related factors and co-morbid diseases. In recent years, germline genetic factors have been linked to CH risk. In this review, we synthesize what is currently known about how genetic variation affects the risk of CH, how this genetic architecture intersects with myeloid neoplasms, and future prospects for CH.",

        "Abstract": "Gain-of-function mutations activating JAK/STAT signaling are seen in the majority of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), most commonly JAK2V617F. Although clinically approved JAK inhibitors improve symptoms and outcomes in MPNs, remissions are rare, and mutant allele burden does not substantively change with chronic therapy. We hypothesized this is due to limitations of current JAK inhibitors to potently and specifically abrogate mutant JAK2 signaling. We therefore developed a conditionally inducible mouse model allowing for sequential activation, and then inactivation, of Jak2V617F from its endogenous locus using a combined Dre-rox/Cre-lox dual-recombinase system. Jak2V617F deletion abrogates MPN features, induces depletion of mutant-specific hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, and extends overall survival to an extent not observed with pharmacologic JAK inhibition, including when cooccurring with somatic Tet2 loss. Our data suggest JAK2V617F represents the best therapeutic target in MPNs and demonstrate the therapeutic relevance of a dual-recombinase system to assess mutant-specific oncogenic dependencies in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "The identification of cell-type-specific 3D chromatin interactions between regulatory elements can help to decipher gene regulation and to interpret the function of disease-associated non-coding variants. However, current chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies are unable to resolve interactions at this resolution when only small numbers of cells are available as input. We therefore present ChromaFold, a deep learning model that predicts 3D contact maps and regulatory interactions from single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data alone. ChromaFold uses pseudobulk chromatin accessibility, co-accessibility profiles across metacells, and predicted CTCF motif tracks as input features and employs a lightweight architecture to enable training on standard GPUs. Once trained on paired scATAC-seq and Hi-C data in human cell lines and tissues, ChromaFold can accurately predict both the 3D contact map and peak-level interactions across diverse human and mouse test cell types. In benchmarking against a recent deep learning method that uses bulk ATAC-seq, DNA sequence, and CTCF ChIP-seq to make cell-type-specific predictions, ChromaFold yields superior prediction performance when including CTCF ChIP-seq data as an input and comparable performance without. Finally, fine-tuning ChromaFold on paired scATAC-seq and Hi-C in a complex tissue enables deconvolution of chromatin interactions across cell subpopulations. ChromaFold thus achieves state-of-the-art prediction of 3D contact maps and regulatory interactions using scATAC-seq alone as input data, enabling accurate inference of cell-type-specific interactions in settings where 3C-based assays are infeasible.",

        "Abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive disease with complex and heterogeneous biology. Although several genomic classifications have been proposed, there is a growing interest in going beyond genomics to stratify AML. In this study, we profile the sphingolipid family of bioactive molecules in 213 primary AML samples and 30 common human AML cell lines. Using an integrative approach, we identify two distinct sphingolipid subtypes in AML characterized by a reciprocal abundance of hexosylceramide (Hex) and sphingomyelin (SM) species. The two Hex-SM clusters organize diverse samples more robustly than known AML driver mutations and are coupled to latent transcriptional states. Using transcriptomic data, we develop a machine-learning classifier to infer the Hex-SM status of AML cases in TCGA and BeatAML clinical repositories. The analyses show that the sphingolipid subtype with deficient Hex and abundant SM is enriched for leukemic stemness transcriptional programs and comprises an unappreciated high-risk subgroup with poor clinical outcomes. Our sphingolipid-focused examination of AML identifies patients least likely to benefit from standard of care and raises the possibility that sphingolipidomic interventions could switch the subtype of AML patients who otherwise lack targetable alternatives.",

        "Abstract": "Measurable residual disease (MRD) is a powerful prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, pre-treatment molecular predictors of immunophenotypic MRD clearance remain unclear. We analyzed a dataset of 211 patients with pre-treatment next-generation sequencing who received induction chemotherapy and had MRD assessed by serial immunophenotypic monitoring after induction, subsequent therapy, and allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). Induction chemotherapy led to MRD- remission, MRD+ remission, and persistent disease in 35%, 27%, and 38% of patients, respectively. With subsequent therapy, 34% of patients with MRD+ and 26% of patients with persistent disease converted to MRD-. Mutations in CEBPA, NRAS, KRAS, and NPM1 predicted high rates of MRD- remission, while mutations in TP53, SF3B1, ASXL1, and RUNX1 and karyotypic abnormalities including inv (3), monosomy 5 or 7 predicted low rates of MRD- remission. Patients with fewer individual clones were more likely to achieve MRD- remission. Among 132 patients who underwent allo-SCT, outcomes were favorable whether patients achieved early MRD- after induction or later MRD- after subsequent therapy prior to allo-SCT. As MRD conversion with chemotherapy prior to allo-SCT is rarely achieved in patients with specific baseline mutational patterns and high clone numbers, upfront inclusion of these patients into clinical trials should be considered.",

        "Abstract": "Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an aging-associated condition characterized by the clonal outgrowth of mutated preleukemic cells. Individuals with CH are at an increased risk of developing hematopoietic malignancies. Here, we describe a novel animal model carrying a recurrent TET2 missense mutation frequently found in patients with CH and leukemia. In a fashion similar to CH, animals show signs of disease late in life when they develop a wide range of myeloid neoplasms, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using single-cell transcriptomic profiling of the bone marrow, we show that disease progression in aged animals correlates with an enhanced inflammatory response and the emergence of an aberrant inflammatory monocytic cell population. The gene signature characteristic of this inflammatory population is associated with poor prognosis in patients with AML. Our study illustrates an example of collaboration between a genetic lesion found in CH and inflammation, leading to transformation and the establishment of blood neoplasms.",

        "Abstract": "Cytosine hypermethylation in and around DNA-binding sites of master transcription factors, including PU.1, occurs in aging hematopoietic stem cells following acquired loss-of-function mutations of DNA methyl-cytosine dioxygenase ten-eleven translocation-2 (TET2), albeit functional relevance has been unclear. We show that Tet2-deficient mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells undergo malignant transformation upon compromised gene regulation through heterozygous deletion of an upstream regulatory region (URE\u0394/WT) of the PU.1 gene. Although compatible with multilineage blood formation at young age, Tet2-deficient PU.1 URE\u0394/WT mice develop highly penetrant, transplantable acute myeloid leukemia (AML) during aging. Leukemic stem and progenitor cells show hypermethylation at putative PU.1-binding sites, fail to activate myeloid enhancers, and are hallmarked by a signature of genes with impaired expression shared with human AML. Our study demonstrates that Tet2 and PU.1 jointly suppress leukemogenesis and uncovers a methylation-sensitive PU.1-dependent gene network as a unifying molecular vulnerability associated with AML.",

A better understanding of how mutations interact with one another to cause disease is critical to developing targeted therapies. Approximately 50% of patients that harbor a common mutation in NPM1 (NPM1cA) also have a mutation in the cohesin complex. As cohesin and Npm1 are known to regulate gene expression, we sought to determine how cohesin mutation alters the transcriptome in the context of NPM1cA. We utilized inducible Npm1",

        "Abstract": "Aire controls immunological tolerance by driving promiscuous expression of a large swath of the genome in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). Its molecular mechanism remains enigmatic. High-resolution chromosome-conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments on ex vivo mTECs revealed Aire to have a widespread impact on higher-order chromatin structure, disfavoring architectural loops while favoring transcriptional loops. In the presence of Aire, cohesin complexes concentrated on superenhancers together with mediator complexes, while the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) was relatively depleted from structural domain boundaries. In particular, Aire associated with the cohesin loader, NIPBL, strengthening this factor's affiliation with cohesin's enzymatic subunits. mTEC transcripts up-regulated in the presence of Aire corresponded closely to those down-regulated in the absence of one of the cohesin subunits, SA-2. A mechanistic model incorporating these findings explains many of the unusual features of Aire's impact on mTEC transcription, providing molecular insight into tolerance induction.",

        "Title": "DOT1L inhibitors block abnormal self-renewal induced by cohesin loss.",
        "Abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a high-risk malignancy characterized by a diverse spectrum of somatic genetic alterations. The mechanisms by which these mutations contribute to leukemia development and how this informs the use of targeted therapies is critical to improving outcomes for patients. Importantly, how to target loss-of-function mutations has been a critical challenge in precision medicine. Heterozygous inactivating mutations in cohesin complex genes contribute to AML in adults by increasing the self-renewal capacity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) by altering PRC2 targeting to induce HOXA9 expression, a key self-renewal transcription factor. Here we sought to delineate the epigenetic mechanism underpinning the enhanced self-renewal conferred by cohesin-haploinsufficiency. First, given the substantial difference in the mutational spectrum between pediatric and adult AML patients, we first sought to identify if HOXA9 was also elevated in children. Next, using primary HSPCs as a model we demonstrate that abnormal self-renewal due to cohesin loss is blocked by DOT1L inhibition. In cohesin-depleted cells, DOT1L inhibition is associated with H3K79me2 depletion and a concomitant increase in H3K27me3. Importantly, we find that there are cohesin-dependent gene expression changes that promote a leukemic profile, including HoxA overexpression, that are preferentially reversed by DOT1L inhibition. Our data further characterize how cohesin mutations contribute to AML development, identifying DOT1L as a potential therapeutic target for adult and pediatric AML patients harboring cohesin mutations.",

        "Abstract": "Azacitidine + venetoclax, decitabine + venetoclax, and low-dose cytarabine + venetoclax are now standard treatments for newly diagnosed older or unfit patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although these combinations are also commonly used in relapsed or refractory AML (RR-AML), clinical and molecular predictors of response and survival in RR-AML are incompletely understood. We retrospectively analyzed clinical and molecular characteristics and outcomes for 86 patients with RR-AML who were treated with venetoclax combinations. The complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) rate was 24%, and the overall response rate was 31% with the inclusion of a morphologic leukemia-free state. Azacitidine + venetoclax resulted in higher response rates compared with low-dose cytarabine + venetoclax (49% vs 15%; P = .008). Median overall survival (OS) was 6.1 months, but it was significantly longer with azacitidine + venetoclax compared with low-dose cytarabine + venetoclax (25 vs 3.9 months; P = .003). This survival advantage of azacitidine + venetoclax over low-dose cytarabine + venetoclax persisted when patients were censored for subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (8.1 vs 3.9 months; P = .035). Mutations in NPM1 were associated with higher response rates, whereas adverse cytogenetics and mutations in TP53, KRAS/NRAS, and SF3B1 were associated with worse OS. Relapse was driven by diverse mechanisms, including acquisition of novel mutations and an increase in cytogenetic complexity. Venetoclax combination therapy is effective in many patients with RR-AML, and pretreatment molecular characteristics may predict outcomes. Trials that evaluate novel agents in combination with venetoclax therapy in patients with RR-AML that have adverse risk genomic features are warranted.",

        "Title": "A cohesive look at leukemogenesis: The cohesin complex and other driving mutations in AML.",
        "Abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) affects tens of thousands of patients a year, yet survival rates are as low as 25% in certain populations. This poor survival rate is partially due to the vast genetic diversity of the disease. Rarely do 2 patients with AML have the same mutational profile, which makes the development of targeted therapies particularly challenging. However, a set of recurrent mutations in chromatin modifiers have been identified in many patients, including mutations in the cohesin complex, which have been identified in up to 20% of cases. Interestingly, the canonical function of the cohesin complex in establishing sister chromatid cohesin during mitosis is unlikely to be the affected role in leukemogenesis. Instead, the cohesin complex's role in DNA looping and gene regulation likely facilitates disease. The epigenetic mechanisms by which cohesin complex mutations promote leukemia are not completely elucidated, but alterations of enhancer-promoter interactions and differential histone modifications have been shown to drive oncogenic gene expression changes. Such changes commonly include HoxA upregulation, which may represent a common pathway that could be therapeutically targeted. As cohesin mutations rarely occur alone, examining the impact of common co-occurring mutations, including those in NPM1, the core-binding factor complex, FLT3, and ASXL1, will yield additional insight. While further study of these mutational interactions is required, current research suggests that the use of combinatorial genetics could be the key to uncovering new targets, allowing for the treatment of AML patients based on their individual genetic profiles.",

        "Abstract": "During the germinal center (GC) reaction, B cells undergo extensive redistribution of cohesin complex and three-dimensional reorganization of their genomes. Yet, the significance of cohesin and architectural programming in the humoral immune response is unknown. Herein we report that homozygous deletion of Smc3, encoding the cohesin ATPase subunit, abrogated GC formation, while, in marked contrast, Smc3 haploinsufficiency resulted in GC hyperplasia, skewing of GC polarity and impaired plasma cell (PC) differentiation. Genome-wide chromosomal conformation and transcriptional profiling revealed defects in GC B cell terminal differentiation programs controlled by the lymphoma epigenetic tumor suppressors Tet2 and Kmt2d and failure of Smc3-haploinsufficient GC B cells to switch from B cell- to PC-defining transcription factors. Smc3 haploinsufficiency preferentially impaired the connectivity of enhancer elements controlling various lymphoma tumor suppressor genes, and, accordingly, Smc3 haploinsufficiency accelerated lymphomagenesis in mice with constitutive Bcl6 expression. Collectively, our data indicate a dose-dependent function for cohesin in humoral immunity to facilitate the B cell to PC phenotypic switch while restricting malignant transformation.",

Bulk molecular profiling has suggested that mutations are acquired in a stepwise fashion: mutant genes with high variant allele frequencies appear early in leukaemogenesis, and mutations with lower variant allele frequencies are thought to be acquired later",

        "Abstract": "Minimal residual disease (MRD) tracking, by next generation sequencing of immunoglobulin sequences, is moving towards clinical implementation in multiple myeloma. However, there is only sparse information available to address whether clonal sequences remain stable for tracking over time, and to what extent light chain sequences are sufficiently unique for tracking. Here, we analyzed immunoglobulin repertoires from 905 plasma cell myeloma and healthy control samples, focusing on the third complementarity determining region (CDR3). Clonal heavy and/or light chain expression was identified in all patients at baseline, with one or more subclones related to the main clone in 3.2%. In 45 patients with 101 sequential samples, the dominant clonal CDR3 sequences remained identical over time, despite differential clonal evolution by whole exome sequencing in 49% of patients. The low frequency of subclonal CDR3 variants, and absence of evolution over time in active multiple myeloma, indicates that tumor cells at this stage are not under selective pressure to undergo antibody affinity maturation. Next, we establish somatic hypermutation and non-templated insertions as the most important determinants of light chain clonal uniqueness, identifying a potentially trackable sequence in the majority of patients. Taken together, we show that dominant clonal sequences identified at baseline are reliable biomarkers for long-term tracking of the malignant clone, including both IGH and the majority of light chain clones.",

        "Abstract": "Transcriptional regulators, including the cohesin complex member STAG2, are recurrently mutated in cancer. The role of STAG2 in gene regulation, hematopoiesis, and tumor suppression remains unresolved. We show that Stag2 deletion in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) results in\u00a0altered hematopoietic function, increased self-renewal, and impaired differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing revealed that, although Stag2 and Stag1 bind a shared set of genomic loci, a component of Stag2 binding sites is\u00a0unoccupied by Stag1, even in Stag2-deficient HSPCs. Although concurrent loss of Stag2 and Stag1 abrogated hematopoiesis, Stag2 loss alone decreased chromatin accessibility and transcription of lineage-specification genes, including Ebf1 and Pax5, leading to increased self-renewal and reduced HSPC commitment to the B cell lineage. Our data illustrate a role for Stag2 in transformation and transcriptional dysregulation distinct from its shared role with Stag1 in chromosomal segregation.",

        "Abstract": "Measurable residual disease is associated with inferior outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Measurable residual disease monitoring enhances risk stratification and may guide therapeutic intervention. The European LeukemiaNet working party recently came to a consensus recommendation incorporating leukemia associated immunophenotype-based different from normal approach by multi-color flow cytometry for measurable residual disease evaluation. However, the analytical approach is highly expertise-dependent and difficult to standardize. Here we demonstrate that loss of plasmacytoid dendritic cell differentiation after 7+3 induction in AML is highly specific for measurable residual disease positivity (specificity 97.4%) in a uniformly treated patient cohort. Moreover, loss of plasmacytoid dendritic cell differentiation as determined by a blast-to-plasmacytoid dendritic cell ratio >10 was strongly associated with inferior overall and relapse-free survival (RFS) [Hazard ratio 2.79, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.98-7.97; ",

STAG2 is the most commonly mutated cohesin member in AML as well as solid tumors. STAG2 is recurrently, mutated in Ewing's Sarcoma, bladder cancer, and glioblastoma, and is one of only ten genes known to be recurrently mutated in over four distinct tissue types of human cancer RECENT FINDINGS: The cohesin complex, a multiprotein ring, is canonically known to align and stabilize replicated chromosomes prior to cell division. Although initially thought to lead to unequal chromosomal separation in dividing cells, data in myeloid malignancies show this is not observed in cohesin mutant MDS/AML, either in large patient cohorts or mouse models. Mounting evidence supports a potential alternate mechanism whereby drivers of cell-type specific gene expression and hematopoietic development are impaired through alteration in three-dimensional nuclear organization and gene structure.",

        "Abstract": "Genome-wide profiling of histone modifications can provide systematic insight into the regulatory elements and programs engaged in a given cell type. However, conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) does not capture quantitative information on histone modification levels, requires large amounts of starting material, and involves tedious processing of each individual sample. Here, we address these limitations with a technology that leverages DNA barcoding to profile chromatin quantitatively and in multiplexed format. We concurrently map relative levels of multiple histone modifications across multiple samples, each comprising as few as a thousand cells. We demonstrate the technology by monitoring dynamic changes following inhibition of p300, EZH2, or KDM5, by linking altered epigenetic landscapes to chromatin regulator mutations, and by mapping active and repressive marks in purified human hematopoietic stem cells. Hence, this technology enables quantitative studies of chromatin state dynamics across rare cell types, genotypes, environmental conditions, and drug treatments.",

        "Abstract": "Cohesin complex members have recently been identified as putative tumor suppressors in hematologic and epithelial malignancies. The cohesin complex guides chromosome segregation; however, cohesin mutant leukemias do not show genomic instability. We hypothesized that reduced cohesin function alters chromatin structure and disrupts cis-regulatory architecture of hematopoietic progenitors. We investigated the consequences of Smc3 deletion in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Biallelic Smc3 loss induced bone marrow aplasia with premature sister chromatid separation and revealed an absolute requirement for cohesin in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. In contrast, Smc3 haploinsufficiency increased self-renewal in vitro and in vivo, including competitive transplantation. Smc3 haploinsufficiency reduced coordinated transcriptional output, including reduced expression of transcription factors and other genes associated with lineage commitment. Smc3 haploinsufficiency cooperated with Flt3-ITD to induce acute leukemia in vivo, with potentiated Stat5 signaling and altered nucleolar topology. These data establish a dose dependency for cohesin in regulating chromatin structure and HSC function.",

        "Title": "Genetic alterations of the cohesin complex genes in myeloid malignancies.",
        "Abstract": "Somatic cohesin mutations have been reported in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To account for the morphologic and cytogenetic diversity of these neoplasms, a well-annotated cohort of 1060 patients with myeloid malignancies including MDS (n = 386), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) (n = 55), MDS/MPNs (n = 169), and AML (n = 450) were analyzed for cohesin gene mutational status, gene expression, and therapeutic and survival outcomes. Somatic cohesin defects were detected in 12% of patients with myeloid malignancies, whereas low expression of these genes was present in an additional 15% of patients. Mutations of cohesin genes were mutually exclusive and mostly resulted in predicted loss of function. Patients with low cohesin gene expression showed similar expression signatures as those with somatic cohesin mutations. Cross-sectional deep-sequencing analysis for clonal hierarchy demonstrated STAG2, SMC3, and RAD21 mutations to be ancestral in 18%, 18%, and 47% of cases, respectively, and each expanded to clonal dominance concordant with disease transformation. Cohesin mutations were significantly associated with RUNX1, Ras-family oncogenes, and BCOR and ASXL1 mutations and were most prevalent in high-risk MDS and secondary AML. Cohesin defects were associated with poor overall survival (27.2 vs 40 months; P = .023), especially in STAG2 mutant MDS patients surviving >12 months (median survival 35 vs 50 months; P = .017).",

        "Abstract": "In the last decade, genomic studies have identified multiple recurrent somatic mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Beginning with the discovery of the JAK2 V617F mutation, multiple additional mutations have been found that constitutively activate cell-signaling pathways, including MPL, CBL, and LNK. Furthermore, several classes of epigenetic modifiers have also been identified, in patients with MPN, revealing a requirement for mutations in other pathways to cooperate with JAK-STAT pathway mutations in MPN pathogenesis. Mutations in the de novo DNA methylation protein, DNMT3A, demethylation machinery, TET2 and related IDH1/2 production of oncometabolite 2-hydroxygluterate, and polycomb complex proteins EZH2 and ASXL1 have opened new pathophysiologic clues into these diseases. The prognostic relevance of these novel disease alleles remains an important area of investigation, and clinical trials are currently underway to determine if these findings represent tractable therapeutic targets, either alone, or in combination with JAK2 inhibition.",

        "Abstract": "T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGLL) is characterized by chronic lymphoproliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and is associated with lineage-restricted cytopenias. Introduction of T-cell receptor (TCR) variable \u03b2-chain (V\u03b2) monoclonal antibodies has facilitated identification and enumeration of clonal CTLs by flow cytometry. A highly skewed TCR V\u03b2 repertoire identified by flow cytometry is strongly associated with monoclonal CDR3 regions by quantitative sequencing and positive TCR\u03b3 rearrangement assays. Therefore, V\u03b2 expansions can serve as surrogate markers of CTL clonality to assess clonal kinetics in T-LGLL. We analyzed the TCR repertoire in 143 patients, 71 of which were available for serial measurements over 6 to 96 months. Although the majority (38/71, 54%) maintained a consistent monoclonal expansion, many (26/71, 37%) unexpectedly displayed a change in the dominant clone, whereby the original CTL clone contracted and another emerged as demonstrated by V\u03b2 typing. Our results demonstrate that the T-cell repertoire is more dynamic in T-LGLL than recognized previously, illustrating the heterogeneity of disorders under this categorization.",

        "Abstract": "T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGL) is characterised by semiautonomous proliferation of monoclonal cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which can result in neutropenia, splenomegaly, and is associated with various autoimmune disorders, particularly rheumatoid arthritis. The coexistence of T-LGL leukemia with B cell abnormalities has previously been identified in case reports. However, no systematic analysis to determine the frequency of this co-association has been reported. Analysis of 63 T-LGL patients revealed a frequent association with humoral immune system abnormalities. We identified coexisting B cell dyscrasias in 17 T-LGL patients (27% of total), of whom 12 had monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) (19%), and 5 had chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (8%). The presence of both MGUS and CLL was found in 2 patients (3%) and follicular lymphoma was identified with MGUS in another T-LGL patient (2%). Additionally, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia was found in 10 additional LGL leukemia patients bringing the total frequency of B cell abnormalities in T-LGL leukemia to 43% in our cohort. The co-association of B cell pathology with T-LGL suggests that either a common antigen drives clonal B and T cells, or that humoral malignancy could serve as the stimulus for lymphocyte expansion representing an overactive anti-tumour surveillance.",
