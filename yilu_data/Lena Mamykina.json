Machine learning (ML) methods can identify patterns, but a key challenge is making actionable suggestions based on personal health data. We introduce GlucoGoalie, which combines ML with an expert system to translate ML output into personalized nutrition goal suggestions for individuals with T2D. In a controlled experiment, participants with T2D found that goal suggestions were understandable and actionable. A 4-week in-the-wild deployment study showed that receiving goal suggestions augmented participants' self-discovery, choosing goals highlighted the multifaceted nature of personal preferences, and the experience of following goals demonstrated the importance of feedback and context. However, we identified tensions between abstract goals and concrete eating experiences and found static text too ambiguous for complex concepts. We discuss implications for ML-based interventions and the need for systems that offer more interactivity, feedback, and negotiation.",

        "Abstract": "In chronic conditions, patients and providers need support in understanding and managing illness over time. Focusing on endometriosis, an enigmatic chronic condition, we conducted interviews with specialists and focus groups with patients to elicit their work in care specifically pertaining to dealing with an enigmatic disease, both independently and in partnership, and how technology could support these efforts. We found that the work to care for the illness, including reflecting on the illness experience and planning for care, is significantly compounded by the complex nature of the disease: enigmatic condition means uncertainty and frustration in care and management; the multi-factorial and systemic features of endometriosis without any guidance to interpret them overwhelm patients and providers; the different temporal resolutions of this chronic condition confuse both patients and provides; and patients and providers negotiate medical knowledge and expertise in an attempt to align their perspectives. We note how this added complexity demands that patients and providers work together to find common ground and align perspectives, and propose three design opportunities (considerations to construct a holistic picture of the patient, design features to reflect and make sense of the illness, and opportunities and mechanisms to correct misalignments and plan for care) and implications to support patients and providers in their care work. Specifically, the enigmatic nature of endometriosis necessitates complementary approaches from human-centered computing and artificial intelligence, and thus opens a number of future research avenues.",

        "Abstract": "Health coaching can be an effective intervention to support self-management of chronic conditions like diabetes, but there are not enough coaching practitioners to reach the growing population in need of support. Conversational technology, like chatbots, presents an opportunity to extend health coaching support to broader and more diverse populations. However, some have suggested that the human element is essential to health coaching and cannot be replicated with technology. In this research, we examine automated health coaching using a theory-grounded, wizard-of-oz chatbot, in comparison with text-based virtual coaching from human practitioners who start with the same protocol as the chatbot but have the freedom to embellish and adjust as needed. We found that even a scripted chatbot can create a coach-like experience for participants. While human coaches displayed advantages expressing empathy and using probing questions to tailor their support, they also encountered tremendous barriers and frustrations adapting to text-based virtual coaching. The chatbot coach had advantages in being persistent, as well as more consistently giving choices and options to foster client autonomy. We discuss implications for the design of virtual health coaching interventions.",

Machine learning (ML) and patient generated data can identify patterns and insights at the individual level, where human cognition falls short, but not all ML-generated information is of equal utility for making health-related decisions. We develop and apply attributable components analysis (ACA), a method inspired by optimal transport theory, to type 2 diabetes self-monitoring data to identify patterns of association between nutrition and blood glucose control. In comparison with linear regression, we found that ACA offers a number of characteristics that make it promising for use in decision support applications. For example, ACA was able to identify non-linear relationships, was more robust to outliers, and offered broader and more expressive uncertainty estimates. In addition, our results highlight a tradeoff between model accuracy and interpretability, and we discuss implications for ML-driven decision support systems.",

        "Title": "Adapting the stage-based model of personal informatics for low-resource communities in the context of type 2 diabetes.",
        "Abstract": "Growing availability of self-monitoring technologies creates new opportunities for collection of personal health data and their use in personalized health informatics interventions. However, much of the previous empirical research and existing theories of individuals' engagement with personal data focused on early adopters and data enthusiasts. Less is understood regarding ways individuals from medically underserved low-income communities who live with chronic diseases engage with self-monitoring in health. In this research, we adapted a widely used theoretical framework, the stage-based model of personal informatics, to the unique attitudes, needs, and constraints of low-income communities. We conducted a qualitative study of attitudes and perceptions regarding tracking and planning in health and other contexts (e.g., finances) among low-income adults living with type 2 diabetes. This study showed distinct differences in participants' attitudes and behaviors around tracking and planning, as well as wide variability in their sense of being in charge of different areas of one's life. Ultimately, we found a strong connection between these two: perceptions of being in charge seems to be strongly connected to an individual's proactive or reactive tracking and planning in that area. Whereas individuals with a greater sense of being in charge of their health were more proactive, meaning they were likely to engage with all the stages of personal informatics model on their own, those with less of a sense of being in charge were more likely to be reactive-relying on their healthcare providers for several critical stages of self-monitoring (deciding what data to collect, integrating data from multiple sources, reflecting over patterns in collected data, and arriving at conclusions and implications for action). Perhaps as a result, these individuals were less likely to experience increases in self-awareness and self-knowledge, common motivating factors to engaging in self-monitoring in the future. We argue that adapting this framework in a way that highlights gaps in individuals' engagement has a number of important implications for future research in biomedical informatics and for the design of new interventions that promote engagement with self-monitoring, and that are robust in light of fragmented engagement.",

        "Abstract": "One way to interject knowledge into clinically impactful forecasting is to use data assimilation, a nonlinear regression that projects data onto a mechanistic physiologic model, instead of a set of functions, such as neural networks. Such regressions have an advantage of being useful with particularly sparse, non-stationary clinical data. However, physiological models are often nonlinear and can have many parameters, leading to potential problems with parameter identifiability, or the ability to find a unique set of parameters that minimize forecasting error. The identifiability problems can be minimized or eliminated by reducing the number of parameters estimated, but reducing the number of estimated parameters also reduces the flexibility of the model and hence increases forecasting error. We propose a method, the parameter Houlihan, that combines traditional machine learning techniques with data assimilation, to select the right set of model parameters to minimize forecasting error while reducing identifiability problems. The method worked well: the data assimilation-based glucose forecasts and estimates for our cohort using the Houlihan-selected parameter sets generally also minimize forecasting errors compared to other parameter selection methods such as by-hand parameter selection. Nevertheless, the forecast with the lowest forecast error does not always accurately represent physiology, but further advancements of the algorithm provide a path for improving physiologic fidelity as well. Our hope is that this methodology represents a first step toward combining machine learning with data assimilation and provides a lower-threshold entry point for using data assimilation with clinical data by helping select the right parameters to estimate.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder that causes abnormal blood glucose (BG) regulation that might result in short and long-term health complications and even death if not properly managed. Currently, there is no cure for diabetes. However, self-management of the disease, especially keeping BG in the recommended range, is central to the treatment. This includes actively tracking BG levels and managing physical activity, diet, and insulin intake. The recent advancements in diabetes technologies and self-management applications have made it easier for patients to have more access to relevant data. In this regard, the development of an artificial pancreas (a closed-loop system), personalized decision systems, and BG event alarms are becoming more apparent than ever. Techniques such as predicting BG (modeling of a personalized profile), and modeling BG dynamics are central to the development of these diabetes management technologies. The increased availability of sufficient patient historical data has paved the way for the introduction of machine learning and its application for intelligent and improved systems for diabetes management. The capability of machine learning to solve complex tasks with dynamic environment and knowledge has contributed to its success in diabetes research.",

        "Abstract": "We introduce data assimilation as a computational method that uses machine learning to combine data with human knowledge in the form of mechanistic models in order to forecast future states, to impute missing data from the past by smoothing, and to infer measurable and unmeasurable quantities that represent clinically and scientifically important phenotypes. We demonstrate the advantages it affords in the context of type 2 diabetes by showing how data assimilation can be used to forecast future glucose values, to impute previously missing glucose values, and to infer type 2 diabetes phenotypes. At the heart of data assimilation is the mechanistic model, here an endocrine model. Such models can vary in complexity, contain testable hypotheses about important mechanics that govern the system (eg, nutrition's effect on glucose), and, as such, constrain the model space, allowing for accurate estimation using very little data.",

        "Abstract": "Variability in individuals' responses to interventions may contribute to small average treatment effects of childhood obesity prevention interventions. But, neither the causes of this individual variability nor the mechanism by which it influences behavior are clear. We used qualitative methods to characterize variability in students' responses to participating in a childhood obesity prevention intervention and psychosocial characteristics related to the behavior change process. We interviewed 18 students participating in a school-based curriculum and policy behavior change intervention. Descriptive coding, summary, and case-ordered descriptive meta-matrices were used to group participants by their psychosocial responses to the intervention and associated behavior changes. Four psychosocial phenotypes of responses emerged: (a) Activated-successful behavior-changers with strong internal supports; (b) Inspired-motivated, but not fully successful behavior-changers with some internal supports, whose taste preferences and food environment overwhelmed their motivation; (c) Reinforced-already practiced target behaviors, were motivated, and had strong family support; and (d) Indifferent-uninterested in behavior change and only did target behaviors if family insisted. Our findings contribute to the field of behavioral medicine by suggesting the presence of specific subgroups of participants who respond differently to behavior change interventions and salient psychosocial characteristics that differentiate among these phenotypes. Future research should examine the utility of prospectively identifying psychosocial phenotypes for improving the tailoring of nutrition behavior change interventions.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to describe the characteristics and technology training needs of underserved adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who participated in a health information technology (HIT) diabetes self-management education (DSME) intervention. Methods The baseline physiological, psychosocial, and technology use characteristics for 220 adults with poorly controlled T2DM were evaluated. Intervention participants received a 1-time intervention training, which included basic technology help, introduction to the Mobile Diabetes Detective (MoDD) website and text message features, and account activation that included subject-specific tailoring. Four additional on-site sessions for participants needing computer or Internet access or technology support were made available based on need. Data regarding on-site visits for usual care were collected. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis. Results The participants were predominately Hispanic and female with a baseline mean A1C of 10% (86 mmol/mol). Only half of the participants regularly used computers or text messages in daily life. The average introductory MoDD training session lasted 73.6 minutes. Following training, approximately one-third (35%) of intervention participants returned for basic and MoDD-specific technology assistance at their federally qualified health center. The most frequently reported duration for the extra training sessions was 30 to 45 minutes. Conclusions Training and support needs were greater than anticipated. Diabetes educators should assess technology abilities prior to implementing health information technology (HIT) diabetes self-management education (DSME) in underserved adults. Future research must invest resources in technology access, anticipate subject training, and develop new training approaches to ensure HIT DSME use and engagement.",

        "Abstract": "Type 2 diabetes leads to premature death and reduced quality of life for 8% of Americans. Nutrition management is critical to maintaining glycemic control, yet it is difficult to achieve due to the high individual differences in glycemic response to nutrition. Anticipating glycemic impact of different meals can be challenging not only for individuals with diabetes, but also for expert diabetes educators. Personalized computational models that can accurately forecast an impact of a given meal on an individual's blood glucose levels can serve as the engine for a new generation of decision support tools for individuals with diabetes. However, to be useful in practice, these computational engines need to generate accurate forecasts based on limited datasets consistent with typical self-monitoring practices of individuals with type 2 diabetes. This paper uses three forecasting machines: (i) data assimilation, a technique borrowed from atmospheric physics and engineering that uses Bayesian modeling to infuse data with human knowledge represented in a mechanistic model, to generate real-time, personalized, adaptable glucose forecasts; (ii) model averaging of data assimilation output; and (iii) dynamical Gaussian process model regression. The proposed data assimilation machine, the primary focus of the paper, uses a modified dual unscented Kalman filter to estimate states and parameters, personalizing the mechanistic models. Model selection is used to make a personalized model selection for the individual and their measurement characteristics. The data assimilation forecasts are empirically evaluated against actual postprandial glucose measurements captured by individuals with type 2 diabetes, and against predictions generated by experienced diabetes educators after reviewing a set of historical nutritional records and glucose measurements for the same individual. The evaluation suggests that the data assimilation forecasts compare well with specific glucose measurements and match or exceed in accuracy expert forecasts. We conclude by examining ways to present predictions as forecast-derived range quantities and evaluate the comparative advantages of these ranges.",

        "Abstract": "An increasing number of individuals turn to online health communities (OHC) for information, advice and support about their health condition or disease. As a result of users' active participation, these forums store overwhelming volumes of information, which can make access to this information challenging and frustrating. To help overcome this problem we designed a discussion visualization tool DisVis. DisVis includes features for overviewing, browsing and finding particular information in a discussion. In a between subjects study, we tested the impact of DisVis on individuals' ability to provide an overview of a discussion, find topics of interest and summarize opinions. The study showed that after using the tool, the accuracy of participants' answers increased by 68% (p-value = 0.023) while at the same time exhibiting trends for reducing the time to answer by 38% with no statistical significance (p-value = 0.082). Qualitative interviews showed general enthusiasm regarding tools for improving browsing and searching for information within discussion forums, suggested different usage scenarios, highlighted opportunities for improving the design of DisVis, and outlined new directions for visualizing user-generated content within OHCs.",

        "Abstract": "Communication and information sharing are critical parts of teamwork in the hospital; however, achieving open and fluid communication can be challenging. Finding specific patient information within documentation can be difficult. Recent studies on handoff documentation tools show that resident handoff notes are increasingly used as an alternative information source by non-physician clinicians. Previous findings also show that residents have become aware of this unintended use. This study investigated the alignment of resident note updating patterns and team note viewing patterns based on usage log data of handoff notes. Qualitative interviews with clinicians were used to triangulate findings based on the log analysis. The study found that notes that were frequently updated were viewed significantly more frequently than notes updated less often (p < 2.2 \u00d7 10(-16)). Almost 44% of all notes had aligned frequency of views and updates. The considerable percentage (56%) of mismatched note utilization suggests an opportunity for improvement.",

        "Abstract": "Handoffs are a critical component of coordinated patient care; however, poor handoffs have been associated with near misses and adverse events. To address this, national agencies have recommended standardizing handoffs, for example through the use of handoff documentation tools. Recent research suggests that handoff tools, typically designed for physicians, are often used by non-physician providers as information sources. In this study, we investigated patterns of edits of an electronic handoff tool in a large teaching hospital through examination of its usage log data. Qualitative interviews with clinicians were used to triangulate log data findings. The analysis showed that despite its primary focus on facilitating transitions of care, information in the handoff documentation tool was updated throughout the day. Interviews with residents confirmed that they purposefully updated information to make it available for other members of their patient care teams. This further reiterates the view of electronic handoff tools as facilitators of team communication and coordination. However, the study also showed considerable variability in the frequency of updates between different units and across different patients. Further research is required to understand what factors drive such diversity in the use of electronic handoff tool and whether this diversity can be used to make inferences about patients' conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Much of what is currently documented in the electronic health record is in response toincreasingly complex and prescriptive medicolegal, reimbursement, and regulatory requirements. These requirements often result in redundant data capture and cumbersome documentation processes. AMIA's 2011 Health Policy Meeting examined key issues in this arena and envisioned changes to help move toward an ideal future state of clinical data capture and documentation. The consensus of the meeting was that, in the move to a technology-enabled healthcare environment, the main purpose of documentation should be to support patient care and improved outcomes for individuals and populations and that documentation for other purposes should be generated as a byproduct of care delivery. This paper summarizes meeting deliberations, and highlights policy recommendations and research priorities. The authors recommend development of a national strategy to review and amend public policies to better support technology-enabled data capture and documentation practices.",
