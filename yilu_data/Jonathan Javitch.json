        "Abstract": "Novel synthetic opioids (NSOs), including both fentanyl and non-fentanyl analogs that act as \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists, are associated with serious intoxication and fatal overdose. Previous studies proposed that G-protein-biased MOR agonists are safer pain medications, while other evidence indicates that low intrinsic efficacy at MOR better explains the reduced opioid side effects. Here, we characterized the in vitro functional profiles of various NSOs at the MOR using adenylate cyclase inhibition and \u03b2-arrestin2 recruitment assays, in conjunction with the application of the receptor depletion approach. By fitting the concentration-response data to the operational model of agonism, we deduced the intrinsic efficacy and affinity for each opioid in the Gi protein signaling and \u03b2-arrestin2 recruitment pathways.

        "Abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent \u223c30% of current drug targets. Ligand binding to these receptors activates G proteins and arrestins, which function in different signaling pathways. Given that functionally selective or biased ligands preferentially activate one of these two groups of pathways, they may be superior medications for certain disease states. The identification of such ligands requires robust drug screening assays for both G protein and arrestin activity. This unit describes protocols for assays that monitor reversible arrestin recruitment to GPCRs in living cells using either bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) or nanoluciferase complementation (NanoLuc). Two types of assays can be used: one configuration directly measures arrestin recruitment to a GPCR fused to a protein tag at its intracellular C-terminus, whereas the other configuration detects arrestin translocation to the plasma membrane in response to activation of an unmodified GPCR. Together, these assays are powerful tools for studying dynamic interactions between GPCRs and arrestins. \u00a9 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

        "Abstract": "Learning action sequences is necessary for normal daily activities. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the dorsal striatum (dStr) encode action sequences through changes in firing at the start and/or stop of action sequences or sustained changes in firing throughout the sequence. Acetylcholine (ACh), released from cholinergic interneurons (ChIs), regulates striatal function by modulating MSN and interneuron excitability, dopamine and glutamate release, and synaptic plasticity. Cholinergic neurons in dStr pause their tonic firing during the performance of learned action sequences. Activation of dopamine type-2 receptors (D2Rs) on ChIs is one mechanism of ChI pausing. In this study we show that deleting D2Rs from ChIs by crossing D2-floxed with ChAT-Cre mice (D2Flox-ChATCre), which inhibits dopamine-mediated ChI pausing and leads to deficits in an operant action sequence task and lower breakpoints in a progressive ratio task. These data suggest that D2Flox-ChATCre mice have reduced motivation to work for sucrose reward, but show no generalized motor skill deficits. D2Flox-ChATCre mice perform similarly to controls in a simple reversal learning task, indicating normal behavioral flexibility, a cognitive function associated with ChIs. ",

        "Abstract": "Single-molecule FRET (smFRET) is a powerful imaging platform capable of revealing dynamic changes in the conformation and proximity of biological molecules. The expansion of smFRET imaging into living cells creates both numerous new research opportunities and new challenges. Automating dataset curation processes is critical to providing consistent, repeatable analysis in an efficient manner, freeing experimentalists to advance the technical boundaries and throughput of what is possible in imaging living cells. Here, we devise an automated solution to the problem of multiple particles entering a region of interest, an otherwise labor-intensive and subjective process that had been performed manually in our previous work. The resolution of these two issues increases the quantity of FRET data and improves the accuracy with which FRET distributions are generated, increasing knowledge about the biological functions of the molecules under study. Our automated approach is straightforward, interpretable, and requires only localization and intensity values for donor and acceptor channel signals, which we compute through our previously published smCellFRET pipeline. The development of our automated approach is informed by the insights of expert experimentalists with extensive experience inspecting smFRET trajectories (displacement and intensity traces) from live cells. We test our automated approach against our recently published research on the metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) and reveal substantial similarities, as well as potential shortcomings in the manual curation process that are addressable using the algorithms we developed here.",

        "Abstract": "Aminergic receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that transduce signals from small endogenous biogenic amines to regulate intracellular signaling pathways. Agonist binding in the ligand binding pocket on the extracellular side opens and prepares a cavity on the intracellular face of the receptors to interact with and activate G proteins and \u03b2-arrestins. Here, by reviewing and analyzing all available aminergic receptor structures, we seek to identify activation-related conformational changes that are independent of the specific scaffold of the bound agonist, which we define as \"activation conformational changes\" (ACCs). While some common intracellular ACCs have been well-documented, identifying common extracellular ACCs, including those in the ligand binding pocket, is complicated by local adjustments to different ligand scaffolds. Our analysis shows no common ACCs at the extracellular ends of the transmembrane helices. Furthermore, the restricted access to the ligand binding pocket identified previously in some receptors is not universal. Notably, the Trp",

        "Abstract": "Opioid-induced respiratory depression limits the use of \u03bc-opioid receptor agonists in clinical settings and is the main cause of opioid overdose fatalities. The relative potential of different opioid agonists to induce respiratory depression at doses exceeding those producing analgesia is understudied despite its relevance to assessments of opioid safety. Here we evaluated the respiratory depressant and anti-nociceptive effects of three novel opioids and relate these measurements to their in vitro efficacy.",

        "Abstract": "Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as desipramine (DMI), are effective at managing neuropathic pain symptoms but often take several weeks to become effective and also lead to considerable side effects. Tianeptine (TIAN) is an atypical antidepressant that activates the mu-opioid receptor but does not produce analgesic tolerance or withdrawal in mice, nor euphoria in humans, at clinically-relevant doses. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of TIAN at persistently alleviating mechanical allodynia in the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain, even well after drug clearance. After finding an accelerated onset of antiallodynic action compared to DMI, we used genetically modified mice to gain insight into RGS protein-associated pathways that modulate the efficacy of TIAN relative to DMI in models of neuropathic pain. Because we observed similar behavioral responses to both TIAN and DMI treatment in RGS4, RGSz1, and RGS9 knockout mice, we performed RNA sequencing on the NAc of TIAN- and DMI-treated mice after prolonged SNI to further clarify potential mechanisms underlying TIANs faster therapeutic actions. Our bioinformatic analysis revealed distinct transcriptomic signatures between the two drugs, with TIAN more directly reversing SNI-induced differentially expressed genes, and further predicted several upstream regulators that may be implicated in onset of action. This new understanding of the molecular pathways underlying TIAN action may enable the development of novel and more efficacious pharmacological approaches for the management of neuropathic pain.",

        "Abstract": "Increasing evidence supports a relationship between lipid metabolism and mental health. In particular, the biostatus of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) correlates with some symptoms of psychiatric disorders, as well as the efficacy of pharmacological treatments. Recent findings highlight a direct association between brain PUFA levels and dopamine transmission, a major neuromodulatory system implicated in the etiology of psychiatric symptoms. However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are still unknown. Here we demonstrate that membrane enrichment in the n-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), potentiates ligand binding to the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), suggesting that DHA acts as an allosteric modulator of this receptor. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm that DHA has a high preference for interaction with the D2R and show that membrane unsaturation selectively enhances the conformational dynamics of the receptor around its second intracellular loop. We find that membrane unsaturation spares G protein activity but potentiates the recruitment of \u03b2-arrestin in cells. Furthermore, in vivo n-3 PUFA deficiency blunts the behavioral effects of two D2R ligands, quinpirole and aripiprazole. These results highlight the importance of membrane unsaturation for D2R activity and provide a putative mechanism for the ability of PUFAs to enhance antipsychotic efficacy.",

        "Title": "Disentangling autoproteolytic cleavage from tethered agonist-dependent activation of the adhesion receptor ADGRL3.",
        "Abstract": "Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor latrophilin 3 (ADGRL3), a cell adhesion molecule highly expressed in the central nervous system, acts in synapse formation through trans interactions with its ligands. It is largely unknown if these interactions serve a purely adhesive function or can modulate G protein signaling. To assess how different structural elements of ADGRL3 (e.g., the adhesive domains, autoproteolytic cleavage site, or tethered agonist (TA)) impact receptor function, we require constructs that disrupt specific receptor features without impacting others. While we showed previously that mutating conserved Phe and Met residues in the TA of ADGRL3-C-terminal fragment (CTF), a CTF truncated to the G protein-coupled receptor proteolysis site, abolishes receptor-mediated G protein activation, we now find that autoproteolytic cleavage is disrupted in the full-length version of this construct. To identify a construct that disrupts TA-dependent activity without impacting proteolysis, we explored other mutations in the TA. We found that mutating the sixth and seventh residues of the TA, Leu and Met, to Ala impaired activity in a serum response element activity assay for both full-length and CTF constructs. We confirmed this activity loss results from impaired G protein coupling using an assay that acutely exposes the TA through controlled proteolysis. The ADGRL3 mutant expresses normally at the cell surface, and immunoblotting shows that it undergoes normal autoproteolysis. Thus, we found a construct that disrupts tethered agonism while retaining autoproteolytic cleavage, providing a tool to disentangle these functions in\u00a0vivo. Our approach and specific findings are likely to be broadly applicable to other adhesion receptors.",

The early phase of illness represents a unique opportunity to provide effective and individualized interventions that can alter illness trajectories. Developmental age and illness stage, including temporal variation in neurobiology, can be targeted to develop phase-specific clinical assessment, biomarkers, and interventions. We review an earlier model whereby an initial glutamate signaling deficit progresses through different phases of allostatic adaptation, moving from potentially reversible functional abnormalities associated with early psychosis and working memory dysfunction, and ending with difficult-to-reverse structural changes after chronic illness. We integrate this model with evidence of dopaminergic abnormalities, including cortical D",

        "Abstract": "\u03b2-arrestins bind G protein-coupled receptors to terminate G protein signaling and to facilitate other downstream signaling pathways. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging, we show that \u03b2-arrestin is strongly autoinhibited in its basal state. Its engagement with a phosphopeptide mimicking phosphorylated receptor tail efficiently releases the \u03b2-arrestin tail from its N domain to assume distinct conformations. Unexpectedly, we find that \u03b2-arrestin binding to phosphorylated receptor, with a phosphorylation barcode identical to the isolated phosphopeptide, is highly inefficient and that agonist-promoted receptor activation is required for \u03b2-arrestin activation, consistent with the release of a sequestered receptor C tail. These findings, together with focused cellular investigations, reveal that agonism and receptor C-tail release are specific determinants of the rate and efficiency of \u03b2-arrestin activation by phosphorylated receptor. We infer that receptor phosphorylation patterns, in combination with receptor agonism, synergistically establish the strength and specificity with which diverse, downstream \u03b2-arrestin-mediated events are directed.",

CYP3A-dependent oxidation of mitragynine yields the metabolite 7-OH mitragynine, a more efficacious \u03bc receptor agonist. While both mitragynine and 7-OH mitragynine can induce anti-nociception in mice, recent evidence suggests that 7-OH mitragynine formed as a metabolite is sufficient to explain the anti-nociceptive effects of mitragynine. However, the ability of 7-OH mitragynine to induce \u03bc receptor-dependent respiratory depression has not yet been studied.",

The actions of these drugs at the dopamine transporter (DAT) play a critical role in their therapeutic efficacy as well as their liability for abuse and dependence. To date, however, the mechanisms that mediate these actions are not well-understood, and therapeutic interventions for AMPH abuse have been limited.

        "Abstract": "Depression and anxiety, two of the most common mental health disorders, share common symptoms and treatments. Most pharmacological agents available to treat these disorders target monoamine systems. Currently, finding the most effective treatment for an individual is a process of trial and error. To better understand how disease etiology may predict treatment response, we studied mice exposed developmentally to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine (FLX). These mice show the murine equivalent of anxiety- and depression-like symptoms in adulthood and here we report that these mice are also behaviorally resistant to the antidepressant-like effects of adult SSRI administration. We investigated whether tianeptine (TIA), which exerts its therapeutic effects through agonism of the mu-opioid receptor instead of targeting monoaminergic systems, would be more effective in this model. We found that C57BL/6J pups exposed to FLX from postnatal day 2 to 11 (PNFLX, the mouse equivalent in terms of brain development to the human third trimester) showed increased avoidant behaviors as adults that failed to improve, or were even exacerbated, by chronic SSRI treatment. By contrast, avoidant behaviors in these same mice were drastically improved following chronic treatment with TIA. Overall, this demonstrates that TIA may be a promising alternative treatment for patients that fail to respond to typical antidepressants, especially in patients whose serotonergic system has been altered by in utero exposure to SSRIs.",

        "Title": "Dopamine D2 receptors modulate the cholinergic pause and inhibitory learning.",
        "Abstract": "Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the striatum respond to salient stimuli with a multiphasic response, including a pause, in neuronal activity. Slice-physiology experiments have shown the importance of dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) in regulating CIN pausing, yet the behavioral significance of the CIN pause and its regulation by dopamine in vivo is still unclear. Here, we show that D2R upregulation in CINs of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) lengthens the pause in CIN activity ex vivo and enlarges a stimulus-evoked decrease in acetylcholine (ACh) levels during behavior. This enhanced dip in ACh levels is associated with a selective deficit in the learning to inhibit responding in a Go/No-Go task. Our data demonstrate, therefore, the importance of CIN D2Rs in modulating the CIN response induced by salient stimuli and point to a role of this response in inhibitory learning. This work has important implications for brain disorders with altered striatal dopamine and ACh function, including schizophrenia and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",

Recent work has shown that bias for arrestin vs G protein signaling could offer certain therapeutic advantages (or disadvantages) in different systems, making assays that measure arrestin binding to receptors important for drug discovery efforts. Herein, we briefly review several commonly used techniques for measuring arrestin binding to receptors, as well as provide an in-depth and methodologically focused review of two methods that do not require receptor modification. The first approach measures direct binding between purified arrestin and rhodopsin, and the second measures the recruitment of arrestin to receptors in living cells.",

        "Title": "Mu opioid receptors on hippocampal GABAergic interneurons are critical for the antidepressant effects of tianeptine.",
        "Abstract": "Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant used in Europe to treat patients who respond poorly to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The recent discovery that tianeptine is a mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonist has provided a potential avenue for expanding our understanding of antidepressant treatment beyond the monoamine hypothesis. Thus, our studies aim to understand the neural circuits underlying tianeptine's antidepressant effects. We show that tianeptine induces rapid antidepressant-like effects in mice after as little as one week of treatment. Critically, we also demonstrate that tianeptine's mechanism of action is distinct from fluoxetine in two important aspects: (1) tianeptine requires MORs for its chronic antidepressant-like effect, while fluoxetine does not, and (2) unlike fluoxetine, tianeptine does not promote hippocampal neurogenesis. Using cell-type specific MOR knockouts we further show that MOR expression on GABAergic cells-specifically somatostatin-positive neurons-is necessary for the acute and chronic antidepressant-like responses to tianeptine. Using central infusion of tianeptine, we also implicate the ventral hippocampus as a potential site of antidepressant action. Moreover, we show a dissociation between the antidepressant-like phenotype and other opioid-like phenotypes resulting from acute tianeptine administration such as analgesia, conditioned place preference, and hyperlocomotion. Taken together, these results suggest a novel entry point for understanding what circuit dysregulations may occur in depression, as well as possible targets for the development of new classes of antidepressant drugs.",

        "Abstract": "We utilized forebrain organoids generated from induced pluripotent stem cells of patients with a syndromic form of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with a homozygous protein-truncating mutation in CNTNAP2, to study its effects on embryonic cortical development. Patients with this mutation present with clinical characteristics of brain overgrowth. Patient-derived forebrain organoids displayed an increase in volume and total cell number that is driven by increased neural progenitor proliferation. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed PFC-excitatory neurons to be the key cell types expressing CNTNAP2. Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEgenes) corroborates aberrant cellular proliferation. Moreover, the DEgenes are enriched for ASD-associated genes. The cell-type-specific signature genes of the CNTNAP2-expressing neurons are associated with clinical phenotypes previously described in patients. The organoid overgrowth phenotypes were largely rescued after correction of the mutation using CRISPR-Cas9. This CNTNAP2-organoid model provides opportunity for further mechanistic inquiry and development of new therapeutic strategies for ASD.",

        "Title": "Dopamine D1R Receptor Stimulation as a Mechanistic Pro-cognitive Target for Schizophrenia.",
        "Abstract": "Decades of research have highlighted the importance of optimal stimulation of cortical dopaminergic receptors, particularly the D1R receptor (D1R), for prefrontal-mediated cognition. This mechanism is particularly relevant to the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, given the abnormalities in cortical dopamine (DA) neurotransmission and in the expression of D1R. Despite the critical need for D1R-based therapeutics, many factors have complicated their development and prevented this important therapeutic target from being adequately interrogated. Challenges include determination of the optimal level of D1R stimulation needed to improve cognitive performance, especially when D1R expression levels, affinity states, DA levels, and the resulting D1R occupancy by DA, are not clearly known in schizophrenia, and may display great interindividual and intraindividual variability related to cognitive states and other physiological variables. These directly affect the selection of the level of stimulation necessary to correct the underlying neurobiology. The optimal mechanism for stimulation is also unknown and could include partial or full agonism, biased agonism, or positive allosteric modulation. Furthermore, the development of D1R targeting drugs has been complicated by complexities in extrapolating from in vitro affinity determinations to in vivo use. Prior D1R-targeted drugs have been unsuccessful due to poor bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and insufficient target engagement at tolerable doses. Newer drugs have recently become available, and these must be tested in the context of carefully designed paradigms that address methodological challenges. In this paper, we discuss how a better understanding of these challenges has shaped our proposed experimental design for testing a new D1R/D5R partial agonist, PF-06412562, renamed CVL-562.",

        "Abstract": "It was first posited, more than five decades ago, that the etiology of schizophrenia involves overstimulation of dopamine receptors. Since then, advanced clinical research methods, including brain imaging, have refined our understanding of the relationship between striatal dopamine and clinical phenotypes as well as disease trajectory. These studies point to striatal dopamine D2 receptors, the main target for all current antipsychotic medications, as being involved in both positive and negative symptoms. Simultaneously, animal models have been central to investigating causal relationships between striatal dopamine D2 receptors and behavioral phenotypes relevant to schizophrenia. We begin this article by reviewing the circuit, cell-type and subcellular locations of dopamine D2 receptors and their downstream signaling pathways. We then summarize results from several mouse models in which D2 receptor levels were altered in various brain regions, cell-types and developmental periods. Behavioral, electrophysiological and anatomical consequences of these D2 receptor perturbations are reviewed with a selective focus on striatal circuit function and alterations in motivated behavior, a core negative symptom of schizophrenia. These studies show that D2 receptors serve distinct physiological roles in different cell types and at different developmental time points, regulating motivated behaviors in sometimes opposing ways. We conclude by considering the clinical implications of this complex regulation of striatal circuit function by D2 receptors.",

        "Abstract": "Mitragynine (MG) is the most abundant alkaloid component of the psychoactive plant material \"kratom\", which according to numerous anecdotal reports shows efficacy in self-medication for pain syndromes, depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. We have developed a synthetic method for selective functionalization of the unexplored C11 position of the MG scaffold (C6 position in indole numbering) via the use of an indole-ethylene glycol adduct and subsequent iridium-catalyzed borylation. Through this work we discover that C11 represents a key locant for fine-tuning opioid receptor signaling efficacy. 7-Hydroxymitragynine (7OH), the parent compound with low efficacy on par with buprenorphine, is transformed to an\u00a0even lower efficacy agonist by introducing a fluorine substituent in this position (11-F-7OH), as demonstrated in vitro at both mouse and human mu opioid receptors (mMOR/hMOR) and in vivo in mouse analgesia tests. Low efficacy opioid agonists are of high interest as candidates for generating safer opioid medications with mitigated adverse effects.",

        "Abstract": "The neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) homolog LeuT from Aquifex aeolicus has proven to be a valuable model for studying the transport mechanism of the NSS family. Crystal structures have captured LeuT in key conformations visited during the transport cycle, allowing for the construction of a nearly complete model of transport, with much of the conformational dynamics studied by computational simulations. Here, we report crystal structures of LeuT representing new intermediate conformations between the outward-facing open and occluded states. These structures, combined with binding and accessibility studies, reveal details of conformational dynamics that can follow substrate binding at the central substrate binding site (S1) of LeuT in outward-facing states, suggesting a potential competition for direction between the outward-open and outward-occluded states at this stage during substrate transport. Our structures further support an intimate interplay between the protonation state of Glu290 and binding of Na1 that may ultimately regulate the outward-open-to-occluded transition.",

Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is a powerful approach with the potential to reveal valuable insights into GPCR organization but has rarely been used in living cells to study protein systems. Here, we report generally applicable methods for using smFRET to detect and track transmembrane proteins diffusing within the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. We leverage this in-cell smFRET approach to show agonist-induced structural dynamics within individual metabotropic glutamate receptor dimers. We apply these methods to representative class A, B and C receptors, finding evidence for receptor monomers, density-dependent dimers and constitutive dimers, respectively.",

        "Title": "A novel luminescence-based \u03b2-arrestin recruitment assay for unmodified receptors.",
        "Abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal through activation of G proteins and subsequent modulation of downstream effectors. More recently, signaling mediated by \u03b2-arrestin has also been implicated in important physiological functions. This has led to great interest in the identification of biased ligands that favor either G protein or \u03b2-arrestin-signaling pathways. However, nearly all screening techniques for measuring \u03b2-arrestin recruitment have required C-terminal receptor modifications that can in principle alter protein interactions and thus signaling. Here, we have developed a novel luminescence-based assay to measure \u03b2-arrestin recruitment to the membrane or early endosomes by unmodified receptors. Our strategy uses NanoLuc, an engineered luciferase from Oplophorus gracilirostris (deep-sea shrimp) that is smaller and brighter than other well-established luciferases. Recently, several publications have explored functional NanoLuc split sites for use in complementation assays. We have identified a unique split site within NanoLuc and fused the corresponding N-terminal fragment to either a plasma membrane or early endosome tether and the C-terminal fragment to \u03b2-arrestins, which form the basis for the MeNArC and EeNArC assays, respectively. Upon receptor activation, \u03b2-arrestin is recruited to the membrane and subsequently internalized in an agonist concentration-dependent manner. This recruitment promotes complementation of the two NanoLuc fragments, thereby reconstituting functional NanoLuc, allowing for quantification of \u03b2-arrestin recruitment with a single luminescence signal. Our assay avoids potential artifacts related to C-terminal receptor modification and has promise as a new generic assay for measuring \u03b2-arrestin recruitment to diverse GPCR types in heterologous or native cells.",

        "Title": "The Role of the Dopamine Transporter in the Effects of Amphetamine on Sleep and Sleep Architecture in Drosophila.",
        "Abstract": "The dopamine transporter (DAT) mediates the inactivation of released dopamine (DA) through its reuptake, and thereby plays an important homeostatic role in dopaminergic neurotransmission. Amphetamines exert their stimulant effects by targeting DAT and inducing the reverse transport of DA, leading to a dramatic increase of extracellular DA. Animal models have proven critical to investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying transporter function and its modulation by psychostimulants such as amphetamine. Here we establish a behavioral model for amphetamine action using adult Drosophila melanogaster. We use it to characterize the effects of amphetamine on sleep and sleep architecture. Our data show that amphetamine induces hyperactivity and disrupts sleep in a DA-dependent manner. Flies that do not express a functional DAT (dDAT null mutants) have been shown to be hyperactive and to exhibit significantly reduced sleep at baseline. Our data show that, in contrast to its action in control flies, amphetamine decreases the locomotor\u00a0activity of dDAT null mutants and restores their sleep by modulating distinct aspects of sleep structure. To begin to explore the circuitry involved in the actions of amphetamine on sleep, we also describe the localization of dDAT throughout the fly brain, particularly in neuropils known to regulate sleep. Together, our data establish Drosophila as a robust model for studying the regulatory mechanisms that govern DAT function and psychostimulant action.",

        "Abstract": "Bright, photostable, and nontoxic fluorescent contrast agents are critical for biological imaging. \"Self-healing\" dyes, in which triplet states are intramolecularly quenched, enable fluorescence imaging by increasing fluorophore brightness and longevity, while simultaneously reducing the generation of reactive oxygen species that promote phototoxicity. Here, we systematically examine the self-healing mechanism in cyanine-class organic fluorophores spanning the visible spectrum. We show that the Baird aromatic triplet-state energy of cyclooctatetraene can be physically altered to achieve order of magnitude enhancements in fluorophore brightness and signal-to-noise ratio in both the presence and absence of oxygen. We leverage these advances to achieve direct measurements of large-scale conformational dynamics within single molecules at submillisecond resolution using wide-field illumination and camera-based detection methods. These findings demonstrate the capacity to image functionally relevant conformational processes in biological systems in the kilohertz regime at physiological oxygen concentrations and shed important light on the multivariate parameters critical to self-healing organic fluorophore design.",

        "Abstract": "The adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) latrophilin 3 (ADGRL3) has been associated with increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance use in human genetic studies. Knockdown in multiple species leads to hyperlocomotion and altered dopamine signaling. Thus, ADGRL3 is a potential target for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders that involve dopamine dysfunction, but its basic signaling properties are poorly understood. Identification of adhesion GPCR signaling partners has been limited by a lack of tools to acutely activate these receptors in living cells. Here, we design a novel acute activation strategy to characterize ADGRL3 signaling by engineering a receptor construct in which we could trigger acute activation enzymatically. Using this assay, we found that ADGRL3 signals through G12/G13 and Gq, with G12/13 the most robustly activated. G\u03b1",

        "Abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly dynamic network of membranes. Here, we combine live-cell microscopy with in situ cryo-electron tomography to directly visualize ER dynamics in several secretory cell types including pancreatic \u03b2-cells and neurons under near-native conditions. Using these imaging approaches, we identify a novel, mobile form of ER, ribosome-associated vesicles (RAVs), found primarily in the cell periphery, which is conserved across different cell types and species. We show that RAVs exist as distinct, highly dynamic structures separate from the intact ER reticular architecture that interact with mitochondria via direct intermembrane contacts. These findings describe a new ER subcompartment within cells.",

However, the transfer of this technology to human brain samples requires a number of precautions due to the nature of the specimens and their specific processing. Here, we used the PLA brightfield detection technique to assess the expression of dopamine D2 receptor and adenosine A2A receptor and their proximity in human postmortem brains, and we developed a systematic random sampling method to help quantify the PLA signals. \u00a9 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

        "Abstract": "Despite the controversy regarding the existence and physiological relevance of class A\u00a0G protein-coupled receptor dimerization, there is substantial evidence for functional interactions between the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) and the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR). A2AR-D2R complexes have been detected in rodent brains by proximity ligation assay; however, their existence in the human brain has not been demonstrated. In this study, we used Brightfield proximity ligation assay, combined with a systematic sampling and a parameter-free naive Bayesian classifier, and demonstrated proximity between the D2R and the A2AR in the adult human ventral striatum, consistent with their colocalization within complexes and the possible existence of D2R-A2AR heteromers. These methods are applicable to the relative quantification of proximity of two proteins, as well as the expression levels of individual proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Multiple neurological, physiological, and behavioral functions are synchronized by circadian clocks into daily rhythms. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies are associated with a decay of circadian rhythms, disruption of sleep patterns, and impaired cognitive function but the mechanisms underlying these alterations are still unclear. Traditional approaches in neurodegeneration research have focused on understanding how pathology impinges on circadian function. Since in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies tau proteostasis is compromised, here we sought to understand the role of tau protein in neuronal circadian biology and related behavior. Considering molecular mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms are conserved from ",

        "Abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins that play important roles in biology. However, our understanding of their function in complex living systems is limited because we lack tools that can target individual receptors with sufficient precision. State-of-the-art approaches, including DREADDs, optoXRs, and PORTL gated-receptors, control GPCR signaling with molecular, cell type, and temporal specificity. Nonetheless, these tools are based on engineered non-native proteins that may (i) express at nonphysiological levels, (ii) localize and turnover incorrectly, and/or (iii) fail to interact with endogenous partners. Alternatively, membrane-anchored ligands (t-toxins, DARTs) target endogenous receptors with molecular and cell type specificity but cannot be turned on and off. In this study, we used a combination of chemistry, biology, and light to control endogenous metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2), a Family C GPCR, in primary cortical neurons. mGluR2 was rapidly, reversibly, and selectively activated with photoswitchable glutamate tethered to a genetically targeted-plasma membrane anchor (",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine (DA) receptors play critical roles in a wide range of behaviours, including sensory processing, motor function, reward and arousal. As such, aberrant DA signalling is associated with numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which DA neurotransmission drives intracellular signalling pathways that modulate behaviour can provide critical insights to guide the development of targeted therapeutics. Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a powerful model with unique advantages to study the mechanisms underlying DA neurotransmission and associated behaviours in a controlled and systematic manner. Many regions in the fly brain innervated by dopaminergic neurons have been mapped and linked to specific behaviours, including associative learning and arousal. Here, we provide an overview of the homology between human and Drosophila dopaminergic systems and review the current literature on the pharmacology, molecular signalling mechanisms and behavioural outcome of DA receptor activation in the Drosophila brain.",

        "Abstract": "Most clinically available antipsychotic drugs (APDs) bind dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) at therapeutic concentrations, and it is thought that they suppress psychotic symptoms by serving as competitive antagonists of dopamine at D2R. Here, we present data that demonstrate that APDs act independently of dopamine at an intracellular pool of D2R to enhance transport of D2R to the cell surface and suggest that APDs can act as pharmacological chaperones at D2R. Among the first- and second-generation APDs that we tested, clozapine exhibited the lowest efficacy for translocating D2R to the cell surface. Thus, our observations could provide a cellular explanation for some of the distinct therapeutic characteristics of clozapine in schizophrenia. They also suggest that differential intracellular actions of APDs at their common G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) target, D2R, could contribute to differences in their clinical profiles.",

        "Abstract": "The dopamine (DA) D2 receptor (D2R) is an important target for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. However, the development of improved therapeutic strategies has been hampered by our incomplete understanding of this receptor's downstream signaling processes in vivo and how these relate to the desired and undesired effects of drugs. D2R is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that activates G protein-dependent as well as non-canonical arrestin-dependent signaling pathways. Whether these effector pathways act alone or in concert to facilitate specific D2R-dependent behaviors is unclear. Here, we report on the development of a D2R mutant that recruits arrestin but is devoid of G protein activity. When expressed virally in \"indirect pathway\" medium spiny neurons (iMSNs) in the ventral striatum of D2R knockout mice, this mutant restored basal locomotor activity and cocaine-induced locomotor activity in a manner indistinguishable from wild-type D2R, indicating that arrestin recruitment can drive locomotion in the absence of D2R-mediated G protein signaling. In contrast, incentive motivation was enhanced only by wild-type D2R, signifying a dissociation in the mechanisms that underlie distinct D2R-dependent behaviors, and opening the door to more targeted therapeutics.",

Methods to detect activities of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have particular relevance for drug screening. Recent development of an engineered luciferase NanoLuc\u00a0created the possibility of generating a novel PCA, which in turn could open a new avenue for developing drug screening assays. Here we identified a novel split position for NanoLuc and demonstrated its use in a series of fusion constructs to detect the activity of GPCRs. The split construct can be applied to a variety of pharmacological screening systems.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine input to the dorsal and ventral striatum originates from separate populations of midbrain neurons. Despite differences in afferent inputs and behavioral output, little is known about how dopamine release is encoded by dopamine receptors on medium spiny neurons (MSNs) across striatal subregions. Here we examined the activation of D2 receptors following the synaptic release of dopamine in the dorsal striatum (DStr) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell. We found that D2 receptor-mediated synaptic currents were slower in the NAc and this difference occurred at the level of D2-receptor signaling. As a result of preferential coupling to G\u03b1o, we also found that D2 receptors in MSNs demonstrated higher sensitivity for dopamine in the NAc. The higher sensitivity in the NAc was eliminated following cocaine exposure. These results identify differences in the sensitivity and timing of D2-receptor signaling across the striatum that influence how nigrostriatal and mesolimbic signals are encoded across these circuits.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) regulate motivated behavior, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain unresolved. Here, we show that selective upregulation of D2Rs in the indirect pathway of the adult NAc enhances the willingness to work for food. Mechanistic studies in brain slices reveal that D2R upregulation attenuates inhibitory transmission at two main output projections of the indirect pathway, the classical long-range projections to the ventral pallidum (VP), as well as local collaterals to direct pathway medium spiny neurons. In vivo physiology confirms the reduction in indirect pathway inhibitory transmission to the VP, and inhibition of indirect pathway terminals to VP is sufficient to enhance motivation. In contrast, D2R upregulation in the indirect pathway does not disinhibit neuronal activity of the direct pathway in vivo. These data suggest that D2Rs in ventral striatal projection neurons promote motivation by weakening the canonical output to the ventral pallidum.",

        "Abstract": "Amphetamines (AMPHs) are potent psychostimulants that are widely used and abused, with profound medical and societal impact. Their actions at dopaminergic neurons are thought to mediate their therapeutic efficacy as well as their liability for abuse and dependence. AMPHs target the dopamine transporter (DAT), the plasmalemmal membrane protein that mediates the inactivation of released dopamine (DA) through its reuptake. AMPHs act as substrates for DAT and are known to cause mobilization of dopamine (DA) to the cell exterior via DAT-mediated reverse transport (efflux). It has become increasingly evident that the mechanisms that regulate AMPH-induced DA efflux are distinct from those that regulate DA uptake. Central to these mechanisms is the phosphorylation of the DAT amino (N)-terminus, which has been repeatedly demonstrated to facilitate DAT-mediated DA efflux, without impacting other aspects of DAT physiology. This review aims to summarize the current status of knowledge regarding DAT N-terminal phosphorylation and its regulation by protein modulators and the membrane microenvironment. A better understanding of these mechanisms may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic approaches that interfere selectively with the pharmacological effects of AMPHs without altering the physiological function of DAT.",

        "Title": "The E2.65A mutation disrupts dynamic binding poses of SB269652 at the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors.",
        "Abstract": "The dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (D2R and D3R) are important targets for antipsychotics and for the treatment of drug abuse. SB269652, a bitopic ligand that simultaneously binds both the orthosteric binding site (OBS) and a secondary binding pocket (SBP) in both D2R and D3R, was found to be a negative allosteric modulator. Previous studies identified Glu2.65 in the SBP to be a key determinant of both the affinity of SB269652 and the magnitude of its cooperativity with orthosteric ligands, as the E2.65A mutation decreased both of these parameters. However, the proposed hydrogen bond (H-bond) between Glu2.65 and the indole moiety of SB269652 is not a strong interaction, and a structure activity relationship study of SB269652 indicates that this H-bond may not be the only element that determines its allosteric properties. To understand the structural basis of the observed phenotype of E2.65A, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations with a cumulative length of ~77 \u03bcs of D2R and D3R wild-type and their E2.65A mutants bound to SB269652. In combination with Markov state model analysis and by characterizing the equilibria of ligand binding modes in different conditions, we found that in both D2R and D3R, whereas the tetrahydroisoquinoline moiety of SB269652 is stably bound in the OBS, the indole-2-carboxamide moiety is dynamic and only intermittently forms H-bonds with Glu2.65. Our results also indicate that the E2.65A mutation significantly affects the overall shape and size of the SBP, as well as the conformation of the N terminus. Thus, our findings suggest that the key role of Glu2.65 in mediating the allosteric properties of SB269652 extends beyond a direct interaction with SB269652, and provide structural insights for rational design of SB269652 derivatives that may retain its allosteric properties.",

        "Abstract": "Family A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) control diverse biological processes and are of great clinical relevance. Their archetype rhodopsin becomes naturally light sensitive by binding covalently to the photoswitchable tethered ligand (PTL) retinal. Other GPCRs, however, neither bind covalently to ligands nor are light sensitive. We sought to impart the logic of rhodopsin to light-insensitive Family A GPCRs in order to enable their remote control in a receptor-specific, cell-type-specific, and spatiotemporally precise manner. Dopamine receptors (DARs) are of particular interest for their roles in motor coordination, appetitive, and aversive behavior, as well as neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and addiction. Using an azobenzene derivative of the well-known DAR ligand 2-(N-phenethyl-N-propyl)amino-5-hydroxytetralin (PPHT), we were able to rapidly, reversibly, and selectively block dopamine D1 and D2 receptors (D1R and D2R) when the PTL was conjugated to an engineered cysteine near the dopamine binding site. Depending on the site of tethering, the ligand behaved as either a photoswitchable tethered neutral antagonist or inverse agonist. Our results indicate that DARs can be chemically engineered for selective remote control by light and provide a template for precision control of Family A GPCRs.",

        "Title": "Treatment resistant depression: A multi-scale, systems biology approach.",
        "Abstract": "An estimated 50% of depressed patients are inadequately treated by available interventions. Even with an eventual recovery, many patients require a trial and error approach, as there are no reliable guidelines to match patients to optimal treatments and many patients develop treatment resistance over time. This situation derives from the heterogeneity of depression and the lack of biomarkers for stratification by distinct depression subtypes. There is thus a dire need for novel therapies. To address these known challenges, we propose a multi-scale framework for fundamental research on depression, aimed at identifying the brain circuits that are dysfunctional in several animal models of depression as well the changes in gene expression that are associated with these models. When combined with human genetic and imaging studies, our preclinical studies are starting to identify candidate circuits and molecules that are altered both in models of disease and in patient populations. Targeting these circuits and mechanisms can lead to novel generations of antidepressants tailored to specific patient populations with distinctive types of molecular and circuit dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "The ability of presynaptic dopamine terminals to tune neurotransmitter release to meet the demands of neuronal activity is critical to neurotransmission. Although vesicle content has been assumed to be static, in\u00a0vitro data increasingly suggest that cell activity modulates vesicle content. Here, we use a coordinated genetic, pharmacological, and imaging approach in Drosophila to study the presynaptic machinery responsible for these vesicular processes in\u00a0vivo. We show that cell depolarization increases synaptic vesicle dopamine content prior to release via vesicular hyperacidification. This depolarization-induced hyperacidification is mediated by the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT). Remarkably, both depolarization-induced dopamine vesicle hyperacidification and its dependence on VGLUT2 are seen in ventral midbrain dopamine neurons in the mouse. Together, these data suggest that in response to depolarization, dopamine vesicles utilize a cascade of vesicular transporters to dynamically increase the vesicular pH gradient, thereby increasing dopamine vesicle content.",

        "Abstract": "The dopamine transporter (DAT), which mediates the inactivation of released dopamine through its reuptake, is the primary molecular target for the actions of psychostimulants. An increasing number of studies support an essential role for phosphorylation of serines (Ser) in the distal amino (N) terminus of DAT in regulating its function. Still, the molecular details of the regulation of phosphorylation and its impact on function are not fully understood. To address this, we have developed and characterized two distinct phospho-antibodies that recognize human DAT when it is phosphorylated at Ser7 or Ser12. Our data show that treatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), amphetamine (AMPH) or okadaic acid (OA) leads to an increase in the phosphorylation of DAT at both residues and that these responses are dependent on the activity of protein kinase C. We also show that AMPH-induced and OA-induced phosphorylation of DAT are dependent on Ca",

        "Abstract": "Bright, long-lasting organic fluorophores enable a broad range of imaging applications. \"Self-healing\" fluorophores, in which intra-molecularly linked protective agents quench photo-induced reactive species, exhibit both enhanced photostability and biological compatibility. However, the self-healing strategy has yet to achieve its predicted potential, particularly in the presence of ambient oxygen where live-cell imaging studies must often be performed. To identify key bottlenecks in this technology that can be used to guide further engineering developments, we synthesized a series of Cy5 derivatives linked to the protective agent cyclooctatetraene (COT) and examined the photophysical mechanisms curtailing their performance. The data obtained reveal that the photostability of self-healing fluorophores is limited by reactivity of the COT protective agent. The addition of electron withdrawing substituents to COT reduced its susceptibility to reactions with molecular oxygen and the fluorophore to which it is attached and increased its capacity to participate in triplet energy transfer. Exploiting these insights, we designed and synthesized a suite of modified COT-fluorophores spanning the visible spectrum that exhibited markedly increased intra-molecular photostabilization. Under ambient oxygen conditions, the photostability of Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophore derivatives increased by 3- and 9-fold ",

        "Abstract": "Depression is a debilitating chronic illness that affects around 350 million people worldwide. Current treatments, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are not ideal because only a fraction of patients achieve remission. Tianeptine is an effective antidepressant with a previously unknown mechanism of action. We recently reported that tianeptine is a full agonist at the mu opioid receptor (MOR). Here we demonstrate that the acute and chronic antidepressant-like behavioral effects of tianeptine in mice require MOR. Interestingly, while tianeptine also produces many opiate-like behavioral effects such as analgesia and reward, it does not lead to tolerance or withdrawal. Furthermore, the primary metabolite of tianeptine (MC5), which has a longer half-life, mimics the behavioral effects of tianeptine in a MOR-dependent fashion. These results point to the possibility that MOR and its downstream signaling cascades may be novel targets for antidepressant drug development.",

        "Abstract": "Maintaining the integrity of cellular membranes is critical to protecting metabolic activities and genetic information from the environment. Regulation of transport across membranes of essential chemicals, including water, nutrients, hormones and many drugs, is therefore key to cellular homeostasis and physiological processes. The two main transporter superfamilies are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that primarily function as efflux transporters, and the solute carrier (SLC) transporters. SLC transporters encompass 52 gene families with almost 400 different human transporter genes. Although long under-explored, SLC transporters are an emerging drug target class and the molecular target of several approved inhibitor drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for depression and sodium/glucose co-transporter (SGLT2) inhibitors for diabetes. Interestingly though, although loss-of-function mutations in numerous human SLC transporters are linked to Mendelian diseases, few reports of SLC transporter activators have appeared, and only inhibitors have been advanced to clinical studies. In this commentary, we discuss several strategies for potentiating SLC transporter function, from direct acting potentiators to modulators of transcription, translation or trafficking. We review the progress made in recent years toward the understanding of the structural and molecular basis of SLC transporter function and the pathways and mechanisms that regulate SLC expression, and describe the opportunities these new insights present for discovery of SLC transporter potentiators. Finally, we highlight the challenges associated with the various approaches and provide some thoughts on future directions that might facilitate the search for SLC potentiators with therapeutic potential.",

        "Abstract": "Ions play key mechanistic roles in the gating dynamics of neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs). In recent microsecond scale molecular dynamics simulations of a complete model of the dopamine transporter, a NSS protein, we observed a partitioning of K(+) ions from the intracellular side toward the unoccupied Na2 site of dopamine transporter following the release of the Na2-bound Na(+) Here we evaluate with computational simulations and experimental measurements of ion affinities under corresponding conditions, the consequences of K(+) binding in the Na2 site of LeuT, a bacterial homolog of NSS, when both Na(+) ions and substrate have left, and the transporter prepares for a new cycle. We compare the results with the consequences of binding Na(+) in the same apo system. Analysis of >50-\u03bcs atomistic molecular dynamics and enhanced sampling trajectories of constructs with Glu(290), either charged or neutral, point to the Glu(290) protonation state as a main determinant in the structural reconfiguration of the extracellular vestibule of LeuT in which a \"water gate\" opens through coordinated motions of residues Leu(25), Tyr(108), and Phe(253) The resulting water channel enables the binding/dissociation of the Na(+) and K(+) ions that are prevalent, respectively, in the extracellular and intracellular environments.",

        "Abstract": "Metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGlu4) is emerging as a potential therapeutic target for numerous central nervous system indications, including Parkinson's disease (PD). As the glutamate binding sites among the eight mGlu receptors are highly conserved, modulation of receptor activity via allosteric sites within the receptor transmembrane domains using positive and negative allosteric modulators (PAMs and NAMs, respectively) has become a common strategy. We and others have used PAMs targeting mGlu4 to show that potentiation of receptor signaling induces antiparkinsonian activity in a variety of PD animal models, including haloperidol-induced catalepsy and 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesion. Recently, mGlu4 has been reported to form heteromeric complexes with other mGlu receptor subtypes, such as mGlu2, and the resulting heteromer exhibits a distinct pharmacological profile in response to allosteric modulators. For example, some mGlu4 PAMs do not appear to potentiate glutamate activity when mGlu2 and mGlu4 are coexpressed, whereas other compounds potentiate mGlu4 responses regardless of mGlu2 coexpression. We report here the discovery and characterization of VU0418506, a novel mGlu4 PAM with activity in rodent PD models. Using pharmacological approaches and Complemented Donor-Acceptor resonance energy transfer (CODA-RET) technology, we find that VU0418506 does not potentiate agonist-induced activity when mGlu2 and mGlu4 are heterodimerized, suggesting that the antiparkinsonian action of mGlu4 PAMs can be induced by compounds without activity at mGlu2/4 heteromers.",

        "Title": "Synthetic and Receptor Signaling Explorations of the Mitragyna Alkaloids: Mitragynine as an Atypical Molecular Framework for Opioid Receptor Modulators.",
        "Abstract": "Mu-opioid receptor agonists represent mainstays of pain management. However, the therapeutic use of these agents is associated with serious side effects, including potentially lethal respiratory depression. Accordingly, there is a longstanding interest in the development of new opioid analgesics with improved therapeutic profiles. The alkaloids of the Southeast Asian plant Mitragyna speciosa, represented by the prototypical member mitragynine, are an unusual class of opioid receptor modulators with distinct pharmacological properties. Here we describe the first receptor-level functional characterization of mitragynine and related natural alkaloids at the human mu-, kappa-, and delta-opioid receptors. These results show that mitragynine and the oxidized analogue 7-hydroxymitragynine, are partial agonists of the human mu-opioid receptor and competitive antagonists at the kappa- and delta-opioid receptors. We also show that mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are G-protein-biased agonists of the mu-opioid receptor, which do not recruit \u03b2-arrestin following receptor activation. Therefore, the Mitragyna alkaloid scaffold represents a novel framework for the development of functionally biased opioid modulators, which may exhibit improved therapeutic profiles. Also presented is an enantioselective total synthesis of both (-)-mitragynine and its unnatural enantiomer, (+)-mitragynine, employing a proline-catalyzed Mannich-Michael reaction sequence as the key transformation. Pharmacological evaluation of (+)-mitragynine revealed its much weaker opioid activity. Likewise, the intermediates and chemical transformations developed in the total synthesis allowed the elucidation of previously unexplored structure-activity relationships (SAR) within the Mitragyna scaffold. Molecular docking studies, in combination with the observed chemical SAR, suggest that Mitragyna alkaloids adopt a binding pose at the mu-opioid receptor that is distinct from that of classical opioids.",

        "Abstract": "Novel 1-, 5-, and 8-substituted analogues of sumanirole (1), a dopamine D2/D3 receptor (D2R/D3R) agonist, were synthesized. Binding affinities at both D2R and D3R were higher when determined in competition with the agonist radioligand [(3)H]7-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin (7-OH-DPAT) than with the antagonist radioligand [(3)H]N-methylspiperone. Although 1 was confirmed as a D2R-preferential agonist, its selectivity in binding and functional studies was lower than previously reported. All analogues were determined to be D2R/D3R agonists in both GoBRET and mitogenesis functional assays. Loss of efficacy was detected for the N-1-substituted analogues at D3R. In contrast, the N-5-alkyl-substituted analogues, and notably the n-butyl-arylamides (22b and 22c), all showed improved affinity at D2R over 1 with neither a loss of efficacy nor an increase in selectivity. Computational modeling provided a structural basis for the D2R selectivity of 1, illustrating how subtle differences in the highly homologous orthosteric binding site (OBS) differentially affect D2R/D3R affinity and functional efficacy.",

        "Abstract": "Biased agonism describes the ability of ligands to stabilize different conformations of a GPCR linked to distinct functional outcomes and offers the prospect of designing pathway-specific drugs that avoid on-target side effects. This mechanism is usually inferred from pharmacological data with the assumption that the confounding influences of observational (that is, assay dependent) and system (that is, cell background dependent) bias are excluded by experimental design and analysis. Here we reveal that 'kinetic context', as determined by ligand-binding kinetics and the temporal pattern of receptor-signalling processes, can have a profound influence on the apparent bias of a series of agonists for the dopamine D2 receptor and can even lead to reversals in the direction of bias. We propose that kinetic context must be acknowledged in the design and interpretation of studies of biased agonism.",

        "Title": "Mechanisms of amphetamine action illuminated through optical monitoring of dopamine synaptic vesicles in Drosophila brain.",
        "Abstract": "Amphetamines elevate extracellular dopamine, but the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. Here we show in rodents that acute pharmacological inhibition of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) blocks amphetamine-induced locomotion and self-administration without impacting cocaine-induced behaviours. To study VMAT's role in mediating amphetamine action in dopamine neurons, we have used novel genetic, pharmacological and optical approaches in Drosophila melanogaster. In an ex vivo whole-brain preparation, fluorescent reporters of vesicular cargo and of vesicular pH reveal that amphetamine redistributes vesicle contents and diminishes the vesicle pH-gradient responsible for dopamine uptake and retention. This amphetamine-induced deacidification requires VMAT function and results from net H(+) antiport by VMAT out of the vesicle lumen coupled to inward amphetamine transport. Amphetamine-induced vesicle deacidification also requires functional dopamine transporter (DAT) at the plasma membrane. Thus, we find that at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, amphetamines must be actively transported by DAT and VMAT in tandem to produce psychostimulant effects.",

        "Abstract": "Direct measurement of insulin is critical for basic and clinical studies of insulin secretion. However, current methods are expensive and time-consuming. We developed an insulin assay based on homogenous time-resolved fluorescence that is significantly more rapid and cost-effective than current commonly used approaches. This assay was applied effectively to an insulin secreting cell line, INS-1E cells, as well as pancreatic islets, allowing us to validate the assay by elucidating mechanisms by which dopamine regulates insulin release. We found that dopamine functioned as a significant negative modulator of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Further, we showed that bromocriptine, a known dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist and newly approved drug used for treatment of type II diabetes mellitus, also decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in islets to levels comparable to those caused by dopamine treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Recent work has shown that the choice of the type and concentration of detergent used for the solubilization of membrane proteins can strongly influence the results of functional experiments. In particular, the amino acid transporter LeuT can bind two substrate molecules in low concentrations of n-dodecyl \u03b2-d-maltopyranoside (DDM), whereas high concentrations reduce the molar binding stoichiometry to 1:1. Subsequent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of LeuT in DDM proteomicelles revealed that DDM can penetrate to the extracellular vestibule and make stable contacts in the functionally important secondary substrate binding site (S2), suggesting a potential competitive mechanism for the reduction in binding stoichiometry. Because annular lipids can be retained during solubilization, we performed MD simulations of LeuT proteomicelles at various stages of the solubilization process. We find that at low DDM concentrations, lipids are retained around the protein and penetration of detergent into the S2 site does not occur, whereas at high concentrations, lipids are displaced and the probability of DDM binding in the S2 site is increased. This behavior is dependent on the type of detergent, however, as we find in the simulations that the detergent lauryl maltose-neopentyl glycol, which is approximately twice the size of DDM and structurally more closely resembles lipids, does not penetrate the protein even at very high concentrations. We present functional studies that confirm the computational findings, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of experimental conditions, and for cautious interpretation of data in gathering mechanistic information about membrane proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs) mediate reuptake of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft and are targets for several therapeutics and psychostimulants. The prokaryotic NSS homologue, LeuT, represents a principal structural model for Na(+)-coupled transport catalyzed by these proteins. Here, we used site-directed fluorescence quenching spectroscopy to identify in LeuT a substrate-induced conformational rearrangement at the inner gate conceivably leading to formation of a structural intermediate preceding transition to the inward-open conformation. The substrate-induced, Na(+)-dependent change required an intact primary substrate-binding site and involved increased water exposure of the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 5. The findings were supported by simulations predicting disruption of an intracellular interaction network leading to a discrete rotation of transmembrane segment 5 and the adjacent intracellular loop 2. The magnitude of the spectroscopic response correlated inversely with the transport rate for different substrates, suggesting that stability of the intermediate represents an unrecognized rate-limiting barrier in the NSS transport mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent \u223c25% of current drug targets. Ligand binding to these receptors activates G proteins and arrestins, which are involved in differential signaling pathways. Because functionally selective or biased ligands activate one of these two pathways, they may be superior medications for certain diseases states. The identification of such ligands requires robust drug screening assays for both G protein and arrestin activity. This unit describes protocols for two bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based assays used to monitor arrestin recruitment to GPCRs. One assay requires modification of GPCRs by fusion to a BRET donor or acceptor moiety, whereas the other can detect arrestin recruitment to unmodified GPCRs.",

        "Abstract": "The dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) is a promising target for the development of pharmacotherapeutics to treat substance use disorders. Several D3R-selective antagonists are effective in animal models of drug abuse, especially in models of relapse. Nevertheless, poor bioavailability, metabolic instability, and/or predicted toxicity have impeded success in translating these drug candidates to clinical use. Herein, we report a series of D3R-selective 4-phenylpiperazines with improved metabolic stability. A subset of these compounds was evaluated for D3R functional efficacy and off-target binding at selected 5-HT receptor subtypes, where significant overlap in SAR with D3R has been observed. Several high affinity D3R antagonists, including compounds 16 (Ki = 0.12 nM) and 32 (Ki = 0.35 nM), showed improved metabolic stability compared to the parent compound, PG648 (6). Notably, 16 and the classic D3R antagonist SB277011A (2) were effective in reducing self-administration of heroin in wild-type but not D3R knockout mice.",

        "Title": "Mechanism of the Association between Na+ Binding and Conformations at the Intracellular Gate in Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporters.",
        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs) terminate neurotransmission by Na(+)-dependent reuptake of released neurotransmitters. Previous studies suggested that Na(+)-binding reconfigures dynamically coupled structural elements in an allosteric interaction network (AIN) responsible for function-related conformational changes, but the intramolecular pathway of this mechanism has remained uncharted. We describe a new approach for the modeling and analysis of intramolecular dynamics in the bacterial NSS homolog LeuT. From microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations and cognate experimental verifications in both LeuT and human dopamine transporter (hDAT), we apply the novel method to identify the composition and the dynamic properties of their conserved AIN. In LeuT, two different perturbations disrupting Na(+) binding and transport (i.e. replacing Na(+) with Li(+) or the Y268A mutation at the intracellular gate) affect the AIN in strikingly similar ways. In contrast, other mutations that affect the intracellular gate (i.e. R5A and D369A) do not significantly impair Na(+) cooperativity and transport. Our analysis shows these perturbations to have much lesser effects on the AIN, underscoring the sensitivity of this novel method to the mechanistic nature of the perturbation. Notably, this set of observations holds as well for hDAT, where the aligned Y335A, R60A, and D436A mutations also produce different impacts on Na(+) dependence. Thus, the detailed AIN generated from our method is shown to connect Na(+) binding with global conformational changes that are critical for the transport mechanism. That the AIN between the Na(+) binding sites and the intracellular gate in bacterial LeuT resembles that in eukaryotic hDAT highlights the conservation of allosteric pathways underlying NSS function.",

        "Abstract": "Hypersecretion of norepinephrine (NE) and angiotensin II (AngII) is a hallmark of major prevalent cardiovascular diseases that contribute to cardiac pathophysiology and morbidity. Herein, we explore whether heterodimerization of presynaptic AngII AT1 receptor (AT1-R) and NE \u03b12C-adrenergic receptor (\u03b12C-AR) could underlie their functional cross-talk to control NE secretion. Multiple bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and protein complementation assays allowed us to accurately probe the structures and functions of the \u03b12C-AR-AT1-R dimer promoted by ligand binding to individual protomers. We found that dual agonist occupancy resulted in a conformation of the heterodimer different from that induced by active individual protomers and triggered atypical Gs-cAMP-PKA signaling. This specific pharmacological signaling unit was identified in vivo to promote not only NE hypersecretion in sympathetic neurons but also sympathetic hyperactivity in mice. Thus, we uncovered a new process by which GPCR heterodimerization creates an original functional pharmacological entity and that could constitute a promising new target in cardiovascular therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Brain imaging studies performed in humans have associated low striatal dopamine release and D2R binding with alcohol dependence. Conversely, high striatal D2R binding has been observed in unaffected members of alcoholic families suggesting that high D2R function may protect against alcohol dependence. A possible protective role of increased D2R levels in the striatum is further supported by preclinical studies in non-human primates and rodents. Here, we determined whether there is a causal relationship between D2R levels and alcohol intake. To this end, we upregulated D2R expression levels in the nucleus accumbens of the adult mouse, but selectively restricted the upregulation to the indirect striatal output pathway, which endogenously expresses D2Rs. After overexpression was established, mice were tested in two models of free-choice alcohol drinking: the continuous and intermittent access two-bottle choice models. As anticipated, we found that D2R upregulation leads to hyperactivity in the open field. Contrary to our expectation, D2R upregulation did not reduce alcohol intake during continuous or intermittent access or when alcohol drinking was tested in the context of aversive outcomes. These data argue against a protective role of accumbal indirect pathway D2Rs in alcohol consumption but emphasize their importance in promoting locomotor activity.",

        "Title": "Evidence for limited D1 and D2 receptor coexpression and colocalization within the dorsal striatum of the neonatal mouse.",
        "Abstract": "The striatum is the major input nucleus of the basal ganglia involved in reward processing, goal-directed behaviors, habit learning, and motor control. The striatum projects to the basal ganglia output nuclei via the \"direct\" and \"indirect\" pathways, which can be distinguished by their projection fields and their opposing effects on behavior. In adult animals, the functional opposition is modulated by the differential actions of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors (D1R, D2R), the expression of which is largely separated between these pathways. To determine whether a similar degree of separation exists earlier in development, we used dual-label immunohistochemistry to map dorsal-striatal D1R and D2R expression at the promoter level in postnatal day 0 (PD0) Drd1a-tdTomato/Drd2-GFP BAC transgenic mice, and at the receptor level by costaining for native D1R and D2R in wildtype (WT) PD0 animals. To assess for potential molecular interactions between D1R and D2R we also employed a recently developed proximity-ligation assay (PLA). Limited coexpression and colocalization of the D1R and D2R proteins was found in clusters of neurons endemic to the \"patch\" compartment as identified by costaining with tyrosine hydroxylase, but not outside these clusters. Moreover, in contrast to our recent findings where we failed to detect a D1R-D2R PLA signal in the adult striatum, in PD0 striatum we did identify a clear PLA signal for this pair of receptors. This colocalization at close proximity points to a possible role for D1R/D2R-mediated crosstalk in early striatal ontogeny.",

        "Abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins that represent an important class of drug targets. In particular, aminergic GPCRs interact with a significant portion of drugs currently on the market. However, most drugs that target these receptors are associated with undesirable side effects, which are due in part to promiscuous interactions with close homologs of the intended target receptors. Here, based on a systematic analysis of all 37 of the currently available high-resolution crystal structures of aminergic GPCRs, we review structural elements that contribute to and can be exploited for designing subtype-selective compounds. We describe the roles of secondary binding pockets (SBPs), as well as differences in ligand entry pathways to the orthosteric binding site, in determining selectivity. In addition, using the available crystal structures, we have identified conformational changes in the SBPs that are associated with receptor activation and explore the implications of these changes for the rational development of selective ligands with tailored efficacy.",

        "Title": "Mutation of three residues in the third intracellular loop of the dopamine D2 receptor creates an internalization-defective receptor.",
        "Abstract": "Arrestins mediate desensitization and internalization of G protein-coupled receptors and also direct receptor signaling toward heterotrimeric G protein-independent signaling pathways. We previously identified a four-residue segment (residues 212-215) of the dopamine D2 receptor that is necessary for arrestin binding in an in vitro heterologous expression system but that also impairs receptor expression. We now describe the characterization of additional mutations at that arrestin binding site in the third intracellular loop. Mutating two (residues 214 and 215) or three (residues 213-215) of the four residues to alanine partially decreased agonist-induced recruitment of arrestin3 without altering activation of a G protein. Arrestin-dependent receptor internalization, which requires arrestin binding to \u03b22-adaptin (the \u03b22 subunit of the clathrin-associated adaptor protein AP2) and clathrin, was disproportionately affected by the three-residue mutation, with no agonist-induced internalization observed even in the presence of overexpressed arrestin or G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2. The disjunction between arrestin recruitment and internalization could not be explained by alterations in the time course of the receptor-arrestin interaction, the recruitment of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2, or the receptor-induced interaction between arrestin and \u03b22-adaptin, suggesting that the mutation impairs a property of the internalization complex that has not yet been identified.",

        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter/sodium symporters (NSSs) terminate synaptic signal transmission by Na+-dependent reuptake of released neurotransmitters. Key conformational states have been reported for the bacterial homolog LeuT and an inhibitor-bound Drosophila dopamine transporter. However, a coherent mechanism of Na+-driven transport has not been described. Here, we present two crystal structures of MhsT, an NSS member from Bacillus halodurans, in occluded inward-facing states with bound Na+ ions and L-tryptophan, providing insight into the cytoplasmic release of Na+. The switch from outward- to inward-oriented states is centered on the partial unwinding of transmembrane helix 5, facilitated by a conserved GlyX9Pro motif that opens an intracellular pathway for water to access the Na2 site. We propose a mechanism, based on our structural and functional findings, in which solvation through the TM5 pathway facilitates Na+ release from Na2 and the transition to an inward-open state.",

        "Title": "Dopamine receptor activation increases HIV entry into primary human macrophages.",
        "Abstract": "Macrophages are the primary cell type infected with HIV in the central nervous system, and infection of these cells is a major component in the development of neuropathogenesis and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. Within the brains of drug abusers, macrophages are exposed to increased levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that mediates the addictive and reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse such as cocaine and methamphetamine. In this study we examined the effects of dopamine on HIV entry into primary human macrophages. Exposure to dopamine during infection increased the entry of R5 tropic HIV into macrophages, irrespective of the concentration of the viral inoculum. The entry pathway affected was CCR5 dependent, as antagonizing CCR5 with the small molecule inhibitor TAK779 completely blocked entry. The effect was dose-dependent and had a steep threshold, only occurring above 108 M dopamine. The dopamine-mediated increase in entry required dopamine receptor activation, as it was abrogated by the pan-dopamine receptor antagonist flupenthixol, and could be mediated through both subtypes of dopamine receptors. These findings indicate that the effects of dopamine on macrophages may have a significant impact on HIV pathogenesis. They also suggest that drug-induced increases in CNS dopamine may be a common mechanism by which drugs of abuse with distinct modes of action exacerbate neuroinflammation and contribute to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in infected drug abusers.",

        "Abstract": "SB269652 is to our knowledge the first drug-like allosteric modulator of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), but it contains structural features associated with orthosteric D2R antagonists. Using a functional complementation system to control the identity of individual protomers within a dimeric D2R complex, we converted the pharmacology of the interaction between SB269652 and dopamine from allosteric to competitive by impairing ligand binding to one of the protomers, indicating that the allostery requires D2R dimers. Additional experiments identified a 'bitopic' pose for SB269652 extending from the orthosteric site into a secondary pocket at the extracellular end of the transmembrane (TM) domain, involving TM2 and TM7. Engagement of this secondary pocket was a requirement for the allosteric pharmacology of SB269652. This suggests a new mechanism whereby a bitopic ligand binds in an extended pose on one G protein-coupled receptor protomer to allosterically modulate the binding of a ligand to the orthosteric site of a second protomer.",

        "Title": "PIP2 regulates psychostimulant behaviors through its interaction with a membrane protein.",
        "Abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) regulates the function of ion channels and transporters. Here, we demonstrate that PIP2 directly binds the human dopamine (DA) transporter (hDAT), a key regulator of DA homeostasis and a target of the psychostimulant amphetamine (AMPH). This binding occurs through electrostatic interactions with positively charged hDAT N-terminal residues and is shown to facilitate AMPH-induced, DAT-mediated DA efflux and the psychomotor properties of AMPH. Substitution of these residues with uncharged amino acids reduces hDAT-PIP2 interactions and AMPH-induced DA efflux without altering the hDAT physiological function of DA uptake. We evaluated the significance of this interaction in vivo using locomotion as a behavioral assay in Drosophila melanogaster. Expression of mutated hDAT with reduced PIP2 interaction in Drosophila DA neurons impairs AMPH-induced locomotion without altering basal locomotion. We present what is to our knowledge the first demonstration of how PIP2 interactions with a membrane protein can regulate the behaviors of complex organisms.",

        "Title": "Discovery and characterization of a G protein-biased agonist that inhibits \u03b2-arrestin recruitment to the D2 dopamine receptor.",
        "Abstract": "A high-throughput screening campaign was conducted to interrogate a 380,000+ small-molecule library for novel D2 dopamine receptor modulators using a calcium mobilization assay. Active agonist compounds from the primary screen were examined for orthogonal D2 dopamine receptor signaling activities including cAMP modulation and \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. Although the majority of the subsequently confirmed hits activated all signaling pathways tested, several compounds showed a diminished ability to stimulate \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. One such compound (MLS1547; 5-chloro-7-[(4-pyridin-2-ylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]quinolin-8-ol) is a highly efficacious agonist at D2 receptor-mediated G protein-linked signaling, but does not recruit \u03b2-arrestin as demonstrated using two different assays. This compound does, however, antagonize dopamine-stimulated \u03b2-arrestin recruitment to the D2 receptor. In an effort to investigate the chemical scaffold of MLS1547 further, we characterized a set of 24 analogs of MLS1547 with respect to their ability to inhibit cAMP accumulation or stimulate \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. A number of the analogs were similar to MLS1547 in that they displayed agonist activity for inhibiting cAMP accumulation, but did not stimulate \u03b2-arrestin recruitment (i.e., they were highly biased). In contrast, other analogs displayed various degrees of G protein signaling bias. These results provided the basis to use pharmacophore modeling and molecular docking analyses to build a preliminary structure-activity relationship of the functionally selective properties of this series of compounds. In summary, we have identified and characterized a novel G protein-biased agonist of the D2 dopamine receptor and identified structural features that may contribute to its biased signaling properties.",

        "Title": "Conformational dynamics of ligand-dependent alternating access in LeuT.",
        "Abstract": "The leucine transporter (LeuT) from Aquifex aeolicus is a bacterial homolog of neurotransmitter/sodium symporters (NSSs) that catalyze reuptake of neurotransmitters at the synapse. Crystal structures of wild-type and mutants of LeuT have been interpreted as conformational states in the coupled transport cycle. However, the mechanistic identities inferred from these structures have not been validated, and the ligand-dependent conformational equilibrium of LeuT has not been defined. Here, we used distance measurements between spin-label pairs to elucidate Na(+)- and leucine-dependent conformational changes on the intracellular and extracellular sides of the transporter. The results identify structural motifs that underlie the isomerization of LeuT between outward-facing, inward-facing and occluded states. The conformational changes reported here present a dynamic picture of the alternating-access mechanism of LeuT and NSSs that is different from the inferences reached from currently available structural models.",

        "Title": "Conformational changes in dopamine transporter intracellular regions upon cocaine binding and dopamine translocation.",
        "Abstract": "The dopamine transporter (DAT), a member of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter family, mediates the reuptake of dopamine at the synaptic cleft. DAT is the primary target for psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine. We previously demonstrated that cocaine binding and dopamine transport alter the accessibility of Cys342 in the third intracellular loop (IL3). To study the conformational changes associated with the functional mechanism of the transporter, we made cysteine substitution mutants, one at a time, from Phe332 to Ser351 in IL3 of the background DAT construct, X7C, in which 7 endogenous cysteines were mutated. The accessibility of the 20 engineered cysteines to polar charged sulfhydryl reagents was studied in the absence and presence of cocaine or dopamine. Of the 11 positions that reacted with methanethiosulfonate ethyl ammonium, as evidenced by inhibition of ligand binding, 5 were protected against this inhibition by cocaine and dopamine (S333C, S334C, N336C, M342C and T349C), indicating that reagent accessibility is affected by conformational changes associated with inhibitor and substrate binding. In some of the cysteine mutants, transport activity is disrupted, but can be rescued by the presence of zinc, most likely because the distribution between inward- and outward-facing conformations is restored by zinc binding. The experimental data were interpreted in the context of molecular models of DAT in both the inward- and outward-facing conformations. Differences in the solvent accessible surface area for individual IL3 residues calculated for these states correlate well with the experimental accessibility data, and suggest that protection by ligand binding results from the stabilization of the outward-facing configuration. Changes in the residue interaction networks observed from the molecular dynamics simulations also revealed the critical roles of several positions during the conformational transitions. We conclude that the IL3 region of DAT undergoes significant conformational changes in transitions necessary for both cocaine binding and substrate transport.",

        "Abstract": "The \u03ba-opioid receptor (KOR)-dynorphin system has been implicated in the control of affect, cognition, and motivation, and is thought to be dysregulated in mood and psychotic disorders, as well as in various phases of opioid dependence. KOR agonists exhibit analgesic effects, although the adverse effects produced by some KOR agonists, including sedation, dysphoria, and hallucinations, have limited their clinical use. Interestingly, KOR-mediated dysphoria, assessed in rodents as aversion, has recently been attributed to the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway following arrestin recruitment to the activated KOR. Therefore, KOR-selective G protein-biased agonists, which do not recruit arrestin, have been proposed to be more effective analgesics, without the adverse effects triggered by the arrestin pathway. As an initial step toward identifying novel biased KOR agonists, we applied a multifaceted screening strategy utilizing both in silico and parallel screening approaches. We identified several KOR-selective ligand scaffolds with a range of signaling bias in vitro. The arylacetamide-based scaffold includes both G protein- and \u03b2-arrestin-biased ligands, while the endogenous peptides and the diterpene scaffolds are G protein biased. Interestingly, we found scaffold screening to be more successful than library screening in identifying biased ligands. Many of the identified functionally selective ligands are potent selective KOR agonists that are reported to be active in the central nervous system. They therefore represent excellent candidates for in vivo studies aiming at determining the behavioral effects mediated by specific KOR-mediated signaling cascades.",

        "Title": "A single glycine in extracellular loop 1 is the critical determinant for pharmacological specificity of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors.",
        "Abstract": "Subtype-selective agents for the dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) have been considered as potential medications for drug addiction and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Medicinal chemistry efforts have led to the discovery of 4-phenylpiperazine derivatives that are >100-fold selective for the dopamine D3 receptor over dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), despite high sequence identity (78% in the transmembrane domain). Based on the recent crystal structure of D3R, we demonstrated that the 4-phenylpiperazine moiety in this class of D3R-selective compounds binds to the conserved orthosteric binding site, whereas the extended aryl amide moiety is oriented toward a divergent secondary binding pocket (SBP). In an effort to further characterize molecular determinants of the selectivity of these compounds, we modeled their binding modes in D3R and D2R by comparative ligand docking and molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the aryl amide moiety in the SBP differentially induces conformational changes in transmembrane segment 2 and extracellular loop 1 (EL1), which amplify the divergence of the SBP in D3R and D2R. Receptor chimera and site-directed mutagenesis studies were used to validate these binding modes and to identify a divergent glycine in EL1 as critical to D3R over D2R subtype selectivity. A better understanding of drug-dependent receptor conformations such as these is key to the rational design of compounds targeting a specific receptor among closely related homologs, and may also lead to discovery of novel chemotypes that exploit subtle differences in protein conformations.",

        "Title": "The membrane protein LeuT in micellar systems: aggregation dynamics and detergent binding to the S2 site.",
        "Abstract": "Structural and functional properties of integral membrane proteins are often studied in detergent micellar environments (proteomicelles), but how such proteomicelles form and organize is not well understood. This makes it difficult to evaluate the relationship between the properties of the proteins measured in such a detergent-solubilized form and under native conditions. To obtain mechanistic information about this relationship for the leucine transporter (LeuT), a prokaryotic homologue of the mammalian neurotransmitter/sodium symporters (NSSs), we studied the properties of proteomicelles formed by n-dodecyl-\u03b2,D-maltopyranoside (DDM) detergent. Extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of different protein/detergent/water number ratios revealed the formation of a proteomicelle characterized by a constant-sized shell of detergents surrounding LeuT protecting its transmembrane segments from unfavorable hydrophobic/hydrophilic exposure. Regardless of the DDM content in the simulated system, this shell consisted of a constant number of DDM molecules (\u223c120 measured at a 4 \u00c5 cutoff distance from LeuT). In contrast, the overall number of DDMs in the proteomicelle (aggregation number) was found to depend on the detergent concentration, reaching a saturation value of 226\u00b117 DDMs in the highest concentration regime simulated. Remarkably, we found that at high detergent-to-protein ratios we observed two independent ways of DDM penetration into LeuT, both leading to a positioning of the DDM molecule in the second substrate (S2) binding site of LeuT. Consonant with several recent experimental studies demonstrating changes in functional properties of membrane proteins due to detergent, our findings highlight how the environment in which the membrane proteins are examined may affect the outcome and interpretation of their mechanistic features.",

        "Abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) transduce many important physiological signals and are targets for a large fraction of therapeutic drugs. Members of the largest family of GPCRs (family A) are thought to self-associate as dimers and higher-order oligomers, although the significance of such quaternary structures for signaling or receptor trafficking is known for only a few examples. One outstanding question is the physical stability of family A oligomers in cell membranes. Stable oligomers would be expected to move through cellular compartments and membrane domains as intact groups of protomers. Here, we test this prediction by recruiting subsets of affinity-tagged family A protomers into artificial microdomains on the surface of living cells and asking if untagged protomers move into these domains (are corecruited) at the same time. We find that tagged \u03b2\u2082 adrenergic and \u03bc-opioid protomers are unable to corecruit untagged protomers into microdomains. In contrast, tagged metabotropic glutamate receptor protomers do corecruit untagged protomers into such microdomains, which is consistent with the known covalent mechanism whereby these family C receptors dimerize. These observations suggest that interactions between these family A protomers are too weak to directly influence subcellular location, and that mechanisms that move these receptors between subcellular compartments and domains must operate on individual protomers.",

Eukaryotic NSSs are chloride-dependent, whereas prokaryotic NSS homologs like LeuT are chloride-independent but contain an acidic residue (Glu290 in LeuT) at a site where eukaryotic NSSs have a serine. The LeuT-E290S mutant displays chloride-dependent activity. We show that, in LeuT-E290S cocrystallized with bromide or chloride, the anion is coordinated by side chain hydroxyls from Tyr47, Ser290, and Thr254 and the side chain amide of Gln250. The bound anion and the nearby sodium ion in the Na1 site organize a connection between their coordinating residues and the extracellular gate of LeuT through a continuous H-bond network. The specific insights from the structures, combined with results from substrate binding studies and molecular dynamics simulations, reveal an anion-dependent occlusion mechanism for NSS and shed light on the functional role of chloride binding.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a negative feedback autocrine regulatory circuit for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in purified human islets in vitro. Using chronoamperometry and in vitro glucose-stimulated insulin secretion measurements, evidence is provided that dopamine (DA), which is loaded into insulin-containing secretory granules by vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 in human \u03b2-cells, is released in response to glucose stimulation. DA then acts as a negative regulator of insulin secretion via its action on D2R, which are also expressed on \u03b2-cells. We found that antagonism of receptors participating in islet DA signaling generally drive increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. These in vitro observations may represent correlates of the in vivo metabolic changes associated with the use of atypical antipsychotics, such as increased adiposity.",

        "Abstract": "\u03ba-Opioid receptor (KOR) agonists do not activate the reward pathway stimulated by morphine-like \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists and thus have been considered to be promising nonaddictive analgesics. However, KOR agonists produce other adverse effects, including dysphoria, diuresis, and constipation. The therapeutic promise of KOR agonists has nonetheless recently been revived by studies showing that their dysphoric effects require arrestin recruitment, whereas their analgesic effects do not. Moreover, KOR agonist-induced antinociceptive tolerance observed in vivo has also been proposed to be correlated to the ability to induce arrestin-dependent phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization of the receptor. The discovery of functionally selective drugs that are therapeutically effective without the adverse effects triggered by the arrestin pathway is thus an important goal. We have identified such an extreme G protein-biased KOR compound, 6'-guanidinonaltrindole (6'-GNTI), a potent partial agonist at the KOR receptor for the G protein activation pathway that does not recruit arrestin. Indeed, 6'-GNTI functions as an antagonist to block the arrestin recruitment and KOR internalization induced by other nonbiased agonists. As an extremely G protein-biased KOR agonist, 6'-GNTI represents a promising lead compound in the search for nonaddictive opioid analgesic as its signaling profile suggests that it will be without the dysphoria and other adverse effects promoted by arrestin recruitment and its downstream signaling.",

        "Abstract": "Inhibitory neurotransmission is mediated primarily by GABA. The metabotropic GABA(B) receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor central to mammalian brain function. Malfunction of GABA(B) receptor has been implicated in several neurological disorders. GABA(B) receptor functions as a heterodimeric assembly of GBR1 and GBR2 subunits, where GBR1 is responsible for ligand-binding and GBR2 is responsible for G protein coupling. Here we demonstrate that the GBR2 ectodomain directly interacts with the GBR1 ectodomain to increase agonist affinity by selectively stabilizing the agonist-bound conformation of GBR1. We present the crystal structure of the GBR2 ectodomain, which reveals a polar heterodimeric interface. We also identify specific heterodimer contacts from both subunits, and GBR1 residues involved in ligand recognition. Lastly, our structural and functional data indicate that the GBR2 ectodomain adopts a constitutively open conformation, suggesting a structural asymmetry in the active state of GABA(B) receptor that is unique to the GABAergic system.",

        "Abstract": "The dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) has been implicated in substance abuse and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The high sequence homology between the D3R and D2R, especially within the orthosteric binding site (OBS) that binds dopamine, has made the development of D3R-selective compounds challenging. Here, we deconstruct into pharmacophoric elements a series of D3R-selective substituted-4-phenylpiperazine compounds and use computational simulations and binding and activation studies to dissect the structural bases for D3R selectivity and efficacy. We find that selectivity arises from divergent interactions within a second binding pocket (SBP) separate from the OBS, whereas efficacy depends on the binding mode in the OBS. Our findings reveal structural features of the receptor that are critical to selectivity and efficacy that can be used to design highly D3R-selective ligands with targeted efficacies. These findings are generalizable to other GPCRs in which the SBP can be targeted by bitopic or allosteric ligands.",

        "Title": "Yohimbine depresses excitatory transmission in BNST and impairs extinction of cocaine place preference through orexin-dependent, norepinephrine-independent processes.",
        "Abstract": "The alpha2 adrenergic receptor (\u03b1(2)-AR) antagonist yohimbine is a widely used tool for the study of anxiogenesis and stress-induced drug-seeking behavior. We previously demonstrated that yohimbine paradoxically depresses excitatory transmission in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a region critical to the integration of stress and reward pathways, and produces an impairment of extinction of cocaine-conditioned place preference (cocaine-CPP) independent of \u03b1(2)-AR signaling. Recent studies show yohimbine-induced drug-seeking behavior is attenuated by orexin receptor 1 (OX(1)R) antagonists. Moreover, yohimbine-induced cocaine-seeking behavior is BNST-dependent. Here, we investigated yohimbine-orexin interactions. Our results demonstrate yohimbine-induced depression of excitatory transmission in the BNST is unaffected by alpha1-AR and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-1 (CRFR(1)) antagonists, but is (1) blocked by OxR antagonists and (2) absent in brain slices from orexin knockout mice. Although the actions of yohimbine were not mimicked by the norepinephrine transporter blocker reboxetine, they were by exogenously applied orexin A. We find that, as with yohimbine, orexin A depression of excitatory transmission in BNST is OX(1)R-dependent. Finally, we find these ex vivo effects are paralleled in vivo, as yohimbine-induced impairment of cocaine-CPP extinction is blocked by a systemically administered OX(1)R antagonist. These data highlight a new mechanism for orexin on excitatory anxiety circuits and demonstrate that some of the actions of yohimbine may be directly dependent upon orexin signaling and independent of norepinephrine and CRF in the BNST.",

        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter:Na(+) symporters (NSSs), the targets of antidepressants and psychostimulants, recapture neurotransmitters from the synapse in a Na(+)-dependent symport mechanism. The crystal structure of the NSS homolog LeuT from Aquifex aeolicus revealed one leucine substrate in an occluded, centrally located (S1) binding site next to two Na(+) ions. Computational studies combined with binding and flux experiments identified a second substrate (S2) site and a molecular mechanism of Na(+)-substrate symport that depends upon the allosteric interaction of substrate molecules in the two high-affinity sites. Here we show that the S2 site, which has not yet been identified by crystallographic approaches, can be blocked during preparation of detergent-solubilized LeuT, thereby obscuring its crucial role in Na(+)-coupled symport. This finding points to the need for caution in selecting experimental environments in which the properties and mechanistic features of membrane proteins can be delineated.",

        "Title": "Paraquat neurotoxicity is mediated by the dopamine transporter and organic cation transporter-3.",
        "Abstract": "The herbicide paraquat (PQ) has increasingly been reported in epidemiological studies to enhance the risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, case-control studies report that individuals with genetic variants in the dopamine transporter (DAT, SLC6A) have a higher PD risk when exposed to PQ. However, it remains a topic of debate whether PQ can enter dopamine (DA) neurons through DAT. We report here a mechanism by which PQ is transported by DAT: In its native divalent cation state, PQ(2+) is not a substrate for DAT; however, when converted to the monovalent cation PQ(+) by either a reducing agent or NADPH oxidase on microglia, it becomes a substrate for DAT and is accumulated in DA neurons, where it induces oxidative stress and cytotoxicity. Impaired DAT function in cultured cells and mutant mice significantly attenuated neurotoxicity induced by PQ(+). In addition to DAT, PQ(+) is also a substrate for the organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3, Slc22a3), which is abundantly expressed in non-DA cells in the nigrostriatal regions. In mice with Oct3 deficiency, enhanced striatal damage was detected after PQ treatment. This increased sensitivity likely results from reduced buffering capacity by non-DA cells, leading to more PQ(+) being available for uptake by DA neurons. This study provides a mechanism by which DAT and Oct3 modulate nigrostriatal damage induced by PQ(2+)/PQ(+) redox cycling.",

        "Abstract": "Elucidating the key signal transduction pathways essential for both antipsychotic efficacy and side-effect profiles is essential for developing safer and more effective therapies. Recent work has highlighted noncanonical modes of dopamine D(2) receptor (D(2)R) signaling via \u03b2-arrestins as being important for the therapeutic actions of both antipsychotic and antimanic agents. We thus sought to create unique D(2)R agonists that display signaling bias via \u03b2-arrestin-ergic signaling. Through a robust diversity-oriented modification of the scaffold represented by aripiprazole (1), we discovered UNC9975 (2), UNC0006 (3), and UNC9994 (4) as unprecedented \u03b2-arrestin-biased D(2)R ligands. These compounds also represent unprecedented \u03b2-arrestin-biased ligands for a G(i)-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Significantly, UNC9975, UNC0006, and UNC9994 are simultaneously antagonists of G(i)-regulated cAMP production and partial agonists for D(2)R/\u03b2-arrestin-2 interactions. Importantly, UNC9975 displayed potent antipsychotic-like activity without inducing motoric side effects in inbred C57BL/6 mice in vivo. Genetic deletion of \u03b2-arrestin-2 simultaneously attenuated the antipsychotic actions of UNC9975 and transformed it into a typical antipsychotic drug with a high propensity to induce catalepsy. Similarly, the antipsychotic-like activity displayed by UNC9994, an extremely \u03b2-arrestin-biased D(2)R agonist, in wild-type mice was completely abolished in \u03b2-arrestin-2 knockout mice. Taken together, our results suggest that \u03b2-arrestin signaling and recruitment can be simultaneously a significant contributor to antipsychotic efficacy and protective against motoric side effects. These functionally selective, \u03b2-arrestin-biased D(2)R ligands represent valuable chemical probes for further investigations of D(2)R signaling in health and disease.",

        "Title": "Imaging the high-affinity state of the dopamine D2 receptor in vivo: fact or fiction?",
        "Abstract": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has been used for more than three decades to image and quantify dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) in vivo with antagonist radioligands but in the recent years agonist radioligands have also been employed. In vitro competition studies have demonstrated that agonists bind to both a high and a low-affinity state of the D2Rs, of which the high affinity state reflects receptors that are coupled to G-proteins and the low-affinity state reflects receptors uncoupled from G-proteins. In contrast, antagonists bind with uniform affinity to the total pool of receptors. Results of these studies led to the proposal that D2Rs exist in high and low-affinity states for agonists in vivo and sparked the development and use of agonist radioligands for PET imaging with the primary purpose of measuring the proportion of receptors in the high-affinity (activating) state. Although several lines of research support the presence of high and low-affinity states of D2Rs and their detection by in vivo imaging paradigms, a growing body of controversial data has now called this into question. These include both in vivo and ex vivo studies of anesthesia effects, rodent models with increased proportions of high-affinity state D2Rs as well as the molecular evidence for stable receptor-G-protein complexes. In this commentary we review these data and discuss the evidence for the in vivo existence of D2Rs configured in high and low-affinity states and whether or not the high-affinity state of the D2R can, in fact, be imaged in vivo with agonist radioligands.",

        "Abstract": "The existence of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) dimers and/or oligomers has been demonstrated in heterologous systems using a variety of biochemical and biophysical assays. While these interactions are the subject of intense research because of their potential role in modulating signaling and altering pharmacology, evidence for the existence of receptor interactions in vivo is still elusive because of a lack of appropriate methods to detect them. Here, we adapted and optimized a proximity ligation assay (PLA) for the detection in brain slices of molecular proximity of two antigens located on either the same or two different GPCRs. Using this approach, we were able to confirm the existence of dopamine D2 and adenosine A2A receptor complexes in the striatum of mice ex vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Here we present a new method that combines protein complementation with resonance energy transfer to study conformational changes in response to activation of a defined G protein-coupled receptor heteromer, and we apply the approach to the putative dopamine D1-D2 receptor heteromer. Remarkably, the potency of the D2 dopamine receptor (D2R) agonist R-(-)-10,11-dihydroxy-N-n-propylnoraporphine (NPA) to change the G\u03b1(i) conformation via the D2R protomer in the D1-D2 heteromer was enhanced ten-fold relative to its potency in the D2R homomer. In contrast, the potencies of the D2R agonists dopamine and quinpirole were the same in the homomer and heteromer. Thus, we have uncovered a molecular mechanism for functional selectivity in which a drug acts differently at a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) protomer depending on the identity of the second protomer participating in the formation of the signaling unit--opening the door to enhancing pharmacological specificity by targeting differences between homomeric and heteromeric signaling.",

        "Title": "Substrate-modulated gating dynamics in a Na+-coupled neurotransmitter transporter homologue.",
        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter/Na(+) symporters (NSSs) terminate neuronal signalling by recapturing neurotransmitter released into the synapse in a co-transport (symport) mechanism driven by the Na(+) electrochemical gradient. NSSs for dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin are targeted by the psychostimulants cocaine and amphetamine, as well as by antidepressants. The crystal structure of LeuT, a prokaryotic NSS homologue, revealed an occluded conformation in which a leucine (Leu) and two Na(+) are bound deep within the protein. This structure has been the basis for extensive structural and computational exploration of the functional mechanisms of proteins with a LeuT-like fold. Subsequently, an 'outward-open' conformation was determined in the presence of the inhibitor tryptophan, and the Na(+)-dependent formation of a dynamic outward-facing intermediate was identified using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In addition, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging has been used to reveal reversible transitions to an inward-open LeuT conformation, which involve the movement of transmembrane helix TM1a away from the transmembrane helical bundle. We investigated how substrate binding is coupled to structural transitions in LeuT during Na(+)-coupled transport. Here we report a process whereby substrate binding from the extracellular side of LeuT facilitates intracellular gate opening and substrate release at the intracellular face of the protein. In the presence of alanine, a substrate that is transported \u223c10-fold faster than leucine, we observed alanine-induced dynamics in the intracellular gate region of LeuT that directly correlate with transport efficiency. Collectively, our data reveal functionally relevant and previously hidden aspects of the NSS transport mechanism that emphasize the functional importance of a second substrate (S2) binding site within the extracellular vestibule. Substrate binding in this S2 site appears to act cooperatively with the primary substrate (S1) binding site to control intracellular gating more than 30\u2009\u00c5 away, in a manner that allows the Na(+) gradient to power the transport mechanism.",

Whereas several saccharide uptake systems are shared between the different phylogenetic kingdoms, the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system exists almost exclusively in bacteria. This multi-component system includes an integral membrane protein EIIC that transports saccharides and assists in their phosphorylation. Here we present the crystal structure of an EIIC from Bacillus cereus that transports diacetylchitobiose. The EIIC is a homodimer, with an expansive interface formed between the amino-terminal halves of the two protomers. The carboxy-terminal half of each protomer has a large binding pocket that contains a diacetylchitobiose, which is occluded from both sides of the membrane with its site of phosphorylation near the conserved His250 and Glu334 residues. The structure shows the architecture of this important class of transporters, identifies the determinants of substrate binding and phosphorylation, and provides a framework for understanding the mechanism of sugar translocation.",

        "Abstract": "Plasmalemmal neurotransmitter transporters (NTTs) regulate the level of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA) and glutamate, after their release at brain synapses. Stimuli including protein kinase C (PKC) activation can lead to the internalization of some NTTs and a reduction in neurotransmitter clearance capacity. We found that the protein Flotillin-1 (Flot1), also known as Reggie-2, was required for PKC-regulated internalization of members of two different NTT families, the DA transporter (DAT) and the glial glutamate transporter EAAT2, and we identified a conserved serine residue in Flot1 that is essential for transporter internalization. Further analysis revealed that Flot1 was also required to localize DAT within plasma membrane microdomains in stable cell lines, and was essential for amphetamine-induced reverse transport of DA in neurons but not for DA uptake. In sum, our findings provide evidence for a critical role of Flot1-enriched membrane microdomains in PKC-triggered DAT endocytosis and the actions of amphetamine.",

        "Abstract": "The TrkH/TrkG/KtrB proteins mediate K(+) uptake in bacteria and probably evolved from simple K(+) channels by multiple gene duplications or fusions. Here we present the crystal structure of a TrkH from Vibrio parahaemolyticus. TrkH is a homodimer, and each protomer contains an ion permeation pathway. A selectivity filter, similar in architecture to those of K(+) channels but significantly shorter, is lined by backbone and side-chain oxygen atoms. Functional studies showed that TrkH is selective for permeation of K(+) and Rb(+) over smaller ions such as Na(+) or Li(+). Immediately intracellular to the selectivity filter are an intramembrane loop and an arginine residue, both highly conserved, which constrict the permeation pathway. Substituting the arginine with an alanine significantly increases the rate of K(+) flux. These results reveal the molecular basis of K(+) selectivity and suggest a novel gating mechanism for this large and important family of membrane transport proteins.",

The crystal structures of the prokaryotic NSS homolog of DAT, the leucine transporter LeuT, have provided critical structural insights about the occluded and outward-facing conformations visited during the substrate transport, but only limited clues regarding mechanism. To understand the transport mechanism in DAT we have used a homology model based on the LeuT structure in a computational protocol validated previously for LeuT, in which steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations guide the substrate along a pathway leading from the extracellular end to the intracellular (cytoplasmic) end.",

        "Abstract": "Opioid receptors, like other members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, have been shown to associate to form dimers and/or oligomers at the plasma membrane. Whether this association is stable or transient is not known. Recent compelling evidence suggests that at least some GPCRs rapidly associate and dissociate. We have recently calculated binding affinities from free energy estimates to predict transient association between mouse delta opioid receptor (DOR) protomers at a symmetric interface involving the fourth transmembrane (TM4) helix (herein termed \"4\" dimer). Here we present disulfide cross-linking experiments with DOR constructs with cysteines substituted at the extracellular ends of TM4 or TM5 that confirm the formation of DOR complexes involving these helices. Our results are consistent with the involvement of TM4 and/or TM5 at the DOR homodimer interface, but possibly with differing association propensities. Coarse-grained (CG) well-tempered metadynamics simulations of two different dimeric arrangements of DOR involving TM4 alone or with TM5 (herein termed \"4/5\" dimer) in an explicit lipid-water environment confirmed the presence of two structurally and energetically similar configurations of the 4 dimer, as previously assessed by umbrella sampling calculations, and revealed a single energetic minimum of the 4/5 dimer. Additional CG umbrella sampling simulations of the 4/5 dimer indicated that the strength of association between DOR protomers varies depending on the protein region at the interface, with the 4 dimer being more stable than the 4/5 dimer.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine modulates movement, cognition, and emotion through activation of dopamine G protein-coupled receptors in the brain. The crystal structure of the human dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) in complex with the small molecule D2R/D3R-specific antagonist eticlopride reveals important features of the ligand binding pocket and extracellular loops. On the intracellular side of the receptor, a locked conformation of the ionic lock and two distinctly different conformations of intracellular loop 2 are observed. Docking of R-22, a D3R-selective antagonist, reveals an extracellular extension of the eticlopride binding site that comprises a second binding pocket for the aryl amide of R-22, which differs between the highly homologous D2R and D3R. This difference provides direction to the design of D3R-selective agents for treating drug abuse and other neuropsychiatric indications.",

        "Abstract": "In view of the therapeutic importance of dopamine D(3) and D(2) receptors, there remains considerable interest in novel ligands. Herein, we show that the tetrahydroisoquinoline 1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid {4-[2-(cyano-3,4-dihydro-1H-isoquinolin-2-yl)-ethyl]-cyclohexyl}-amide (SB269,652) behaves as an atypical, allosteric antagonist at D(3) and D(2) receptors. Accordingly, SB269,652 potently (low nanomolar range) abolished specific binding of [(3)H]nemanopride and [(3)H]spiperone to Chinese hamster ovary-transfected D(3) receptors when radioligands were used at 0.2 and 0.5 nM, respectively. However, even at high concentrations (5 \u03bcM), SB269,652 only submaximally inhibited the specific binding of these radioligands when they were employed at 10-fold higher concentrations. By analogy, although SB269,652 potently blocked D(3) receptor-mediated activation of G\u03b1(i3) and phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, when concentrations of dopamine were increased by 10-fold, from 1 \u03bcM to 10 \u03bcM, SB269,652 only submaximally inhibited dopamine-induced stimulation of G\u03b1(i3). SB269,652 (up to 10 \u03bcM) only weakly and partially (by approximately 20-30%) inhibited radioligand binding to D(2) receptors. Likewise, SB269,652 only submaximally suppressed D(2) receptor-mediated stimulation of G\u03b1(i3) and G\u03b1(qi5) (detected with the aequorin assay) and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt. Furthermore, SB269,652 only partially (35%) inhibited the dopamine-induced recruitment of \u03b2-arrestin2 to D(2) receptors. Finally, Schild analysis using G\u03b1(i3) assays, and studies of radioligand association and dissociation kinetics, supported allosteric actions of SB269,652 at D(3) and D(2) receptors.",

        "Abstract": "(+/-)-Citalopram (1, 1-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile), and its eutomer, escitalopram (S-(+)-1) are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that are used clinically to treat anxiety and depression. To further explore structure-activity relationships at the serotonin transporter (SERT), a series of (+/-)-4- and 5-substituted citalopram analogues were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for binding at the SERT, dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) in native rodent tissue. Many of these analogues showed high SERT binding affinities (Ki=1-40 nM) and selectivities over both NET and DAT. Selected enantiomeric pairs of analogues were synthesized and both retained enantioselectivity as with S- and R-1, wherein S>R at the SERT. In addition, the enantiomeric pairs of 1 and 5 were tested for binding at the homologous bacterial leucine transporter (LeuT), wherein low affinities and the absence of enantioselectivity suggested distinctive binding sites for these compounds at SERT as compared to LeuT. These novel ligands will provide molecular tools to elucidate drug-protein interactions at the SERT and to relate those to behavioral actions in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Family B of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is composed of receptors that bind peptides, such as secretin, glucagon, parathyroid hormone, and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), which play critical physiological roles. These receptors, like all GPCRs, share a common structural motif of seven membrane-spanning segments, which have been proposed to bind small ligands, such as antalarmin, a nonpeptide antagonist of the type 1 receptor for CRF (CRF(1)). This leads to the hypothesis that as for family A GPCRs, the binding sites of small ligands for family B GPCRs are on the surface of a water-accessible crevice, the binding-site crevice, which is formed by the membrane-spanning segments and extends from the extracellular surface of the receptor into the plane of the membrane. To test this hypothesis we have begun to obtain structural information about family B GPCRs, using as a prototype the CRF(1), by determining the ability of sulfhydryl-specific methanethiosulfonate derivatives, such as the methanethiosulfonate-ethylammonium (MTSEA), to react with CRF(1) and thus irreversibly inhibit (125)I-Tyr(0)-sauvagine binding. We found that MTSEA inhibited (125)I-Tyr(0)-sauvagine binding to CRF(1) and that antalarmin protected against this irreversible inhibition. To identify the susceptible cysteine(s), we mutated, one at a time, four endogenous cysteines to serine. Mutation to serine of Cys211, Cys233, or Cys364 decreased the susceptibility of sauvagine binding to irreversible inhibition by MTSEA. Thus, Cys211, Cys233, and Cys364 at the cytoplasmic ends of the third, fourth, and seventh membrane-spanning segments, respectively, are exposed in the binding site crevice of CRF(1).",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter implicated in multiple functions, including movement, cognition, motivation, and reward. The DA transporter (DAT) is responsible for clearing extracellular DA, thereby terminating DA neurotransmission. Previously, it has been shown that insulin signaling through protein kinase B/Akt regulates DAT function by fine-tuning DAT cell surface expression. Importantly, specific Akt isoforms (e.g., Akt1, Akt2) serve distinct physiological functions. Here, we demonstrate using isoform-specific Akt inhibitors that basal activity of Akt2, rather than Akt1, regulates DAT cell surface expression. Since Akt2 activation is mediated by insulin, these data further implicate insulin signaling as an important modulator of DAT function and dopaminergic tone.",

        "Abstract": "G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) oligomers have been proposed to play critical roles in cell signaling, but confirmation of their existence in a native context remains elusive, as no direct interactions between receptors have been reported. To demonstrate their presence in native tissues, we developed a time-resolved FRET strategy that is based on receptor labeling with selective fluorescent ligands. Specific FRET signals were observed with four different receptors expressed in cell lines, consistent with their dimeric or oligomeric nature in these transfected cells. More notably, the comparison between FRET signals measured with sets of fluorescent agonists and antagonists was consistent with an asymmetric relationship of the two protomers in an activated GPCR dimer. Finally, we applied the strategy to native tissues and succeeded in demonstrating the presence of oxytocin receptor dimers and/or oligomers in mammary gland.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine D(2) receptor antagonism is a unifying property of all antipsychotic drugs in use for schizophrenia. While often effective at ameliorating psychosis, these drugs are largely ineffective at treating negative and cognitive symptoms. Increasing attention is being focused on the complex genetics of the illness and the signaling pathways implicated in its pathophysiology. We review targeted approaches for pharmacotherapy involving the glutamatergic, GABAergic and cholinergic pathways. We also describe several of the major genetic findings that identify signaling pathways representing potential targets for novel pharmacological intervention. These include genes in the 22q11 locus, DISC1, Neuregulin 1/ErbB4, and components of the Akt/GSK-3 pathway.",

        "Abstract": "DAR-0100A, the active enantiomer of dihydrexidine, is a potent dopamine D1 agonist under investigation for treatment of cognitive impairment and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. We measured the dose-occupancy relationship for DAR-0100A at D1 receptors using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in baboons with [(11)C] NNC112 and its binding to D2 with [(11)C] raclopride. Two baboons were scanned with [(11)C] NNC112 at baseline and after three different doses of DAR-0100A. Two baboons were scanned with [(11)C] raclopride at baseline and after one dose of DAR-0100A. Occupancy (\u0394BP(ND)) was computed in the striatum and cortex. A clear relationship was observed between plasma concentration of DAR-0100A and \u0394BP(ND). \u0394BP(ND) was larger in the striatum than in the cortex, consistent with reports showing that 25% of [(11)C] NNC112 BP(ND) in the cortex is attributed to 5-HT(2A). Plasma EC(50) estimates ranged from 150 to 550 ng/mL according to the constraints on the model. There was no detectable effect of DAR-0100A on [(11)C] raclopride BP(ND). These data suggest that at doses likely to be administered to patients, occupancy will not be detectable with [(11)C] NNC112 PET and binding of DAR-0100A to D2 will be negligible. This is the first demonstration with PET of a significant occupancy by a full D1 agonist in vivo.",

We have used site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis to capture the dynamics of LeuT in the region of the extracellular vestibule associated with the binding of Na(+) and leucine. The results outline the Na(+)-dependent formation of a dynamic outward-facing intermediate that exposes the primary substrate binding site and the conformational changes that occlude this binding site upon subsequent binding of the leucine substrate. Furthermore, the binding of the transport inhibitors tryptophan, clomipramine and octyl-glucoside is shown to induce structural changes that distinguish the resulting inhibited conformation from the Na(+)/leucine-bound state.",

        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter:Na(+) symporters (NSS) remove neurotransmitters from the synapse in a reuptake process that is driven by the Na(+) gradient. Drugs that interfere with this reuptake mechanism, such as cocaine and antidepressants, profoundly influence behaviour and mood. To probe the nature of the conformational changes that are associated with substrate binding and transport, we have developed a single-molecule fluorescence imaging assay and combined it with functional and computational studies of the prokaryotic NSS homologue LeuT. Here we show molecular details of the modulation of intracellular gating of LeuT by substrates and inhibitors, as well as by mutations that alter binding, transport or both. Our direct observations of single-molecule transitions, reflecting structural dynamics of the intracellular region of the transporter that might be masked by ensemble averaging or suppressed under crystallographic conditions, are interpreted in the context of an allosteric mechanism that couples ion and substrate binding to transport.",

        "Abstract": "The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) modulates brain circuits involved in attention, reward, and motor activity. Synaptic DA homeostasis is primarily controlled via two presynaptic regulatory mechanisms, DA D(2) receptor (D(2)R)-mediated inhibition of DA synthesis and release, and DA transporter (DAT)-mediated DA clearance. D(2)Rs can physically associate with DAT and regulate DAT function, linking DA release and reuptake to a common mechanism. We have established that the attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder-associated human DAT coding variant Ala559Val (hDAT A559V) results in anomalous DA efflux (ADE) similar to that caused by amphetamine-like psychostimulants. Here, we show that tonic activation of D(2)R provides support for hDAT A559V-mediated ADE. We determine in hDAT A559V a pertussis toxin-sensitive, CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation mechanism that supports D(2)R-driven DA efflux. These studies identify a signaling network downstream of D(2)R activation, normally constraining DA action at synapses, that may be altered by DAT mutation to impact risk for DA-related disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter-sodium symporters (NSS), targets for psychostimulants and therapeutic drugs, have a critical role in neurotransmission. Whereas eukaryotic NSS show chloride-dependent transport, bacterial NSS feature Cl(-)-independent substrate transport. Recently we showed that mutation of an acidic residue near one of the sodium ion-binding sites in LeuT of Aquifex aeolicus or Tyt1 of Fusobacterium nucleatum renders substrate binding and/or transport Cl(-) dependent. We reasoned that the negative charge--provided either by Cl(-) or by the transporter itself--is required for substrate translocation. Here we show that Tyt1 reconstituted in proteoliposomes is strictly dependent on the Na(+) gradient and is stimulated by an inside negative membrane potential and by an inversely oriented proton gradient. Notably, Na(+)/substrate symport elicited H(+) efflux, indicative of Na(+)/substrate symport-coupled H(+) antiport. Mutations that render the transport phenotype Cl(-) dependent essentially abolish the pH dependence. We propose unifying features of charge balance by all NSS members with similar mechanistic features but different molecular solutions.",

        "Title": "Impact of D2 receptor internalization on binding affinity of neuroimaging radiotracers.",
        "Abstract": "Synaptic dopamine (DA) levels seem to affect the in vivo binding of many D2 receptor radioligands. Thus, release of endogenous DA induced by the administration of amphetamine decreases ligand binding, whereas DA depletion increases binding. This is generally thought to be due to competition between endogenous DA and the radioligands for D2 receptors. However, the temporal discrepancy between amphetamine-induced increases in DA as measured by microdialysis, which last on the order of 2 h, and the prolonged decrease in ligand binding, which lasts up to a day, has suggested that agonist-induced D2 receptor internalization may contribute to the sustained decrease in D2 receptor-binding potential seen following a DA surge. To test this hypothesis, we developed an in vitro system showing robust agonist-induced D2 receptor internalization following treatment with the agonist quinpirole. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were stably co-transfected with human D2 receptor, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and arrestin 3. Agonist-induced D2 receptor internalization was demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and radioligand competition binding. The binding of seven D2 antagonists and four agonists to the surface and internalized receptors was measured in intact cells. All the imaging ligands bound with high affinity to both surface and internalized D2 receptors. Affinity of most of the ligands to internalized receptors was modestly lower, indicating that internalization would reduce the binding potential measured in imaging studies carried out with these ligands. However, between-ligand differences in the magnitude of the internalization-associated affinity shift only partly accounted for the data obtained in neuroimaging experiments, suggesting the involvement of mechanisms beyond competition and internalization.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine D(2) receptor antagonism is a unifying property of all antipsychotic drugs in clinical use. Remarkably, the effector molecules through which these medications exert their actions remain poorly characterized. Increasing attention is being focused on Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and wingless (Wnt) signaling pathways, which have been associated with schizophrenia in a number of genetic and postmortem studies. Antipsychotic medications may treat symptoms of psychosis, at least in part, through modulation of levels and activity of Akt, GSK-3, and Wnt-related intracellular signaling. The authors review evidence that Akt/GSK-3 and Wnt-related pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia as well as details of intracellular events related to these molecules mediated by both typical and atypical antipsychotic medications. Further study of Akt/GSK-3 and Wnt signaling may ultimately lead to alternative therapeutics of schizophrenia-related disorders.",

        "Title": "G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 constitutively regulates D2 dopamine receptor expression and signaling independently of receptor phosphorylation.",
        "Abstract": "We investigated the regulatory effects of GRK2 on D(2) dopamine receptor signaling and found that this kinase inhibits both receptor expression and functional signaling in a phosphorylation-independent manner, apparently through different mechanisms. Overexpression of GRK2 was found to suppress receptor expression at the cell surface and enhance agonist-induced internalization, whereas short interfering RNA knockdown of endogenous GRK2 led to an increase in cell surface receptor expression and decreased agonist-mediated endocytosis. These effects were not due to GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the D(2) receptor as a phosphorylation-null receptor mutant was regulated similarly, and overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of GRK2 produced the same effects. The suppression of receptor expression is correlated with constitutive association of GRK2 with the receptor complex as we found that GRK2 and several of its mutants were able to co-immunoprecipitate with the D(2) receptor. Agonist pretreatment did not enhance the ability of GRK2 to co-immunoprecipitate with the receptor. We also found that overexpression of GRK2 attenuated the functional coupling of the D(2) receptor and that this activity required the kinase activity of GRK2 but did not involve receptor phosphorylation, thus suggesting the involvement of an additional GRK2 substrate. Interestingly, we found that the suppression of functional signaling also required the G betagamma binding activity of GRK2 but did not involve the GRK2 N-terminal RH domain. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which GRK2 negatively regulates G protein-coupled receptor signaling in a manner that is independent of receptor phosphorylation.",

        "Abstract": "Chemokine receptors constitute an attractive family of drug targets in the frame of inflammatory diseases. However, targeting specific chemokine receptors may be complicated by their ability to form dimers or higher order oligomers. Using a combination of luminescence complementation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays, we demonstrate for the first time the existence of hetero-oligomeric complexes composed of at least three chemokine receptors (CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR4). We show in T cells and monocytes that negative binding cooperativity takes place between the binding pockets of these receptors, demonstrating their functional interaction in leukocytes. We also show that specific antagonists of one receptor (TAK-779 or AMD3100) lead to functional cross-inhibition of the others. Finally, using the air pouch model in mice, we show that the CCR2 and CCR5 antagonist TAK-779 inhibits cell recruitment promoted by the CXCR4 agonist SDF-1 alpha, demonstrating that cross-inhibition by antagonists also occurs in vivo. Thus, antagonists of the therapeutically important chemokine receptors regulate the functional properties of other receptors to which they do not bind directly with important implications for the use of these agents in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) that result from HIV infection of the central nervous system is increasing. Macrophages, the primary target for HIV within the central nervous system, play a central role in HIV-induced neuropathogenesis. Drug abuse exacerbates HAND, but the mechanism(s) by which this increased neuropathology results in more severe forms of HAND in HIV-infected drug abusers is unclear. The addictive and reinforcing effects of many drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, are mediated by increased extracellular dopamine in the brain. We propose a novel mechanism by which drugs of abuse intensify HIV neuropathogenesis through direct effects of the neurotransmitter dopamine on HIV infection of macrophages. We found that macrophages express dopamine receptors 1 and 2, and dopamine activates macrophages by increasing ERK 1 phosphorylation. Our results demonstrate for the first time that dopamine increases HIV replication in human macrophages and that the mechanism by which dopamine mediates this change is by increasing the total number of HIV-infected macrophages. This increase in HIV replication is mediated by activation of dopamine receptor 2. These findings suggest a common mechanism by which drugs of abuse enhance HIV replication in macrophages and indicate that the drug abuse-heightened levels of central nervous system dopamine could increase viral replication, thereby accelerating the development of HAND.",

        "Abstract": "A major obstacle to understanding the functional importance of dimerization between class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been the methodological limitation in achieving control of the identity of the components comprising the signaling unit. We have developed a functional complementation assay that enables such control, and we demonstrate it here for the human dopamine D2 receptor. The minimal signaling unit, two receptors and a single G protein, is maximally activated by agonist binding to a single protomer, which suggests an asymmetrical activated dimer. Inverse agonist binding to the second protomer enhances signaling, whereas agonist binding to the second protomer blunts signaling. Ligand-independent constitutive activation of the second protomer also inhibits signaling. Thus, GPCR dimer function can be modulated by the activity state of the second protomer, which for a heterodimer may be altered in pathological states. Our new methodology also makes possible the characterization of signaling from a defined heterodimer unit.",

        "Title": "Two allelic isoforms of the serotonin transporter from Schistosoma mansoni display electrogenic transport and high selectivity for serotonin.",
        "Abstract": "The human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni is the primary cause of schistosomiasis, a debilitating disease that affects 200 million individuals in over 70 countries. The biogenic amine serotonin is essential for the survival of the parasite and serotonergic proteins are potential novel drug targets for treating schistosomiasis. Here we characterize two novel serotonin transporter gene transcripts, SmSERT-A and SmSERT-B, from S.mansoni. Southern blot analysis shows that the two mRNAs are the products of different alleles of a single SmSERT gene locus. The two SmSERT forms differ in three amino acid positions near the N-terminus of the protein. Both SmSERTs are expressed in the adult form and in the sporocyst form (infected snails) of the parasite, but are absent from all other stages of the parasite's complex life cycle. Heterologous expression of the two cDNAs in mammalian cells resulted in saturable, sodium-dependent serotonin transport activity with an apparent affinity for serotonin comparable to that of the human serotonin transporter. Although the two SmSERTs are pharmacologically indistinguishable from each other, efflux experiments reveal notably higher substrate selectivity for serotonin compared with their mammalian counterparts. Several well-established substrates for human SERT including (+/-)MDMA, S-(+)amphetamine, RU 24969, and m-CPP are not transported by SmSERTs, underscoring the higher selectivity of the schistosomal isoforms. Voltage-clamp recordings of SmSERT substrate-elicited currents confirm the substrate selectivity observed in efflux experiments and suggest that it may be possible to exploit the electrogenic nature of SmSERT to screen for compounds that target the parasite in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "A role for dopamine (DA) release in the hallucinations and other positive symptoms associated with schizophrenia has long been inferred from the antipsychotic response to D2 DA receptor antagonists and because the DA releaser amphetamine can be psychotogenic. Recent studies suggest that patients with schizophrenia, including those never exposed to antipsychotic drugs, maintain high presynaptic DA accumulation in the striatum. New laboratory approaches are elucidating mechanisms that control the level of presynaptic DA stores, thus contributing to fundamental understanding of the basic pathophysiologic mechanism in schizophrenia.",

        "Abstract": "Toxic organic cations can damage nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways as seen in most parkinsonian syndromes and in some cases of illicit drug exposure. Here, we show that the organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3) is expressed in nondopaminergic cells adjacent to both the soma and terminals of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. We hypothesized that Oct3 contributes to the dopaminergic damage by bidirectionally regulating the local bioavailability of toxic species. Consistent with this view, Oct3 deletion and pharmacological inhibition hampers the release of the toxic organic cation 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium from astrocytes and protects against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in mice. Furthermore, Oct3 deletion impairs the removal of the excess extracellular dopamine induced by methamphetamine and enhances striatal dopaminergic terminal damage caused by this psychostimulant. These results may have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the mechanism of cell death in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases and may open new avenues for neuroprotective intervention.",

        "Title": "G protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation regulates post-endocytic trafficking of the D2 dopamine receptor.",
        "Abstract": "We investigated the role of G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation in agonist-induced desensitization, arrestin association, endocytosis, and intracellular trafficking of the D(2) dopamine receptor (DAR). Agonist activation of D(2) DARs results in rapid and sustained receptor phosphorylation that is solely mediated by GRKs. A survey of GRKs revealed that only GRK2 or GRK3 promotes D(2) DAR phosphorylation. Mutational analyses resulted in the identification of eight serine/threonine residues within the third cytoplasmic loop of the receptor that are phosphorylated by GRK2/3. Simultaneous mutation of these eight residues results in a receptor construct, GRK(-), that is completely devoid of agonist-promoted GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation. We found that both wild-type (WT) and GRK(-) receptors underwent a similar degree of agonist-induced desensitization as assessed using [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assays. Similarly, both receptor constructs internalized to the same extent in response to agonist treatment. Furthermore, using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays to directly assess receptor association with arrestin3, we found no differences between the WT and GRK(-) receptors. Thus, phosphorylation is not required for arrestin-receptor association or agonist-induced desensitization or internalization. In contrast, when we examined recycling of the D(2) DARs to the cell surface, subsequent to agonist-induced endocytosis, the GRK(-) construct exhibited less recycling in comparison with the WT receptor. This impairment appears to be due to a greater propensity of the GRK(-) receptors to down-regulate once internalized. In contrast, if the receptor is highly phosphorylated, then receptor recycling is promoted. These results reveal a novel role for GRK-mediated phosphorylation in regulating the post-endocytic trafficking of a G protein-coupled receptor.",

        "Abstract": "The first crystal structure of the neurotransmitter/sodium symporter homolog LeuT revealed an occluded binding pocket containing leucine and 2 Na(+); later structures showed tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in an extracellular vestibule approximately 11 A above the bound leucine and 2 Na(+). We recently found this region to be a second binding (S2) site and that binding of substrate to this site triggers Na(+)-coupled substrate symport. Here, we show a profound inhibitory effect of n-octyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside (OG), the detergent used for LeuT crystallization, on substrate binding to the S2 site. In parallel, we determined at 2.8 A the structure of LeuT-E290S, a mutant that, like LeuT-WT, binds 2 substrate molecules. This structure was similar to that of WT and clearly revealed an OG molecule in the S2 site. We also observed electron density at the S2 site in LeuT-WT crystals, and this also was accounted for by an OG molecule in that site. Computational analyses, based on the available crystal structures of LeuT, indicated the nature of structural arrangements in the extracellular region of LeuT that differentiate the actions of substrates from inhibitors bound in the S2 site. We conclude that the current LeuT crystal structures, all of which have been solved in OG, represent functionally blocked forms of the transporter, whereas a substrate bound in the S2 site will promote a different state that is essential for Na(+)-coupled symport.",

In stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells, expression of T62D-hDAT was reduced compared with hDAT or T62A-hDAT. T62D-hDAT displayed dramatically reduced [(3)H]dopamine up-take but exhibited a higher basal dopamine efflux compared with hDAT or T62A-hDAT, as determined by measurements of [(3)H]dopamine efflux and amperometry. The high constitutive efflux in T62D-hDAT precluded the measurement of amphetamine-stimulated [(3)H]dopamine efflux, but when dopamine was added internally into voltage-clamped T62D-hDAT cells, amphetamine-induced efflux comparable with hDAT was detected by amperometry. In accordance with findings that Zn(2+) can rescue reduced DA uptake in mutant transporters that are predominantly inward-facing, micromolar concentrations of Zn(2+) markedly potentiated [(3)H]dopamine uptake in T62D-hDAT and permitted the measurement of amphetamine-stimulated dopamine efflux. These results suggest that T62D-hDAT prefers an inward-facing conformation in the transition between inward- and outward-facing conformations. For T62A-hDAT, however, the measured 50% reduction in both [(3)H]dopamine uptake and [(3)H]dopamine efflux was consistent with a slowed transition between inward- and outward-facing conformations. The mechanism underlying the important functional role of Thr62 in hDAT activity suggested by these findings is examined in a structural context using dynamic simulations of a three-dimensional molecular model of DAT.",

        "Abstract": "The psychostimulants d-amphetamine (AMPH) and methamphetamine (METH) release excess dopamine (DA) into the synaptic clefts of dopaminergic neurons. Abnormal DA release is thought to occur by reverse transport through the DA transporter (DAT), and it is believed to underlie the severe behavioral effects of these drugs. Here we compare structurally similar AMPH and METH on DAT function in a heterologous expression system and in an animal model. In the in vitro expression system, DAT-mediated whole-cell currents were greater for METH stimulation than for AMPH. At the same voltage and concentration, METH released five times more DA than AMPH and did so at physiological membrane potentials. At maximally effective concentrations, METH released twice as much [Ca(2+)](i) from internal stores compared with AMPH. [Ca(2+)](i) responses to both drugs were independent of membrane voltage but inhibited by DAT antagonists. Intact phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal domain of DAT were required for the AMPH- and METH-induced increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and for the enhanced effects of METH on [Ca(2+)](i) elevation. Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and protein kinase C inhibitors alone or in combination also blocked AMPH- or METH-induced Ca(2+) responses. Finally, in the rat nucleus accumbens, in vivo voltammetry showed that systemic application of METH inhibited DAT-mediated DA clearance more efficiently than AMPH, resulting in excess external DA. Together these data demonstrate that METH has a stronger effect on DAT-mediated cell physiology than AMPH, which may contribute to the euphoric and addictive properties of METH compared with AMPH.",

        "Abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors are generally thought to be organized as dimers; whether they form higher order oligomers is a topic of much controversy. We combined bioluminescence/fluorescence complementation and energy transfer to demonstrate that at least four dopamine D2 receptors are located in close molecular proximity in living mammalian cells, consistent with their organization as higher order oligomers at the plasma membrane. This implies the existence of multiple receptor interfaces. In addition to the symmetrical interface in the fourth transmembrane segment (TM4) we identified previously by cysteine (Cys) crosslinking, we now show that a patch of residues at the extracellular end of TM1 forms a second symmetrical interface. Crosslinking of D2 receptor with Cys substituted simultaneously into both TM1 and TM4 led to higher order species, consistent with our novel biophysical results. Remarkably, the rate and extent of crosslinking at both interfaces were unaltered over a 100-fold range of receptor expression. Thus, at physiological levels of expression, the receptor is organized in the plasma membrane into a higher order oligomeric structure.",

        "Abstract": "The soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor protein syntaxin 1A (SYN1A) interacts with and regulates the function of transmembrane proteins, including ion channels and neurotransmitter transporters. Here, we define the first 33 amino acids of the N terminus of the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) as the site of direct interaction with SYN1A. Amphetamine (AMPH) increases the association of SYN1A with human DAT (hDAT) in a heterologous expression system (hDAT cells) and with native DAT in murine striatal synaptosomes. Immunoprecipitation of DAT from the biotinylated fraction shows that the AMPH-induced increase in DAT/SYN1A association occurs at the plasma membrane. In a superfusion assay of DA efflux, cells overexpressing SYN1A exhibited significantly greater AMPH-induced DA release with respect to control cells. By combining the patch-clamp technique with amperometry, we measured DA release under voltage clamp. At -60 mV, a physiological resting potential, AMPH did not induce DA efflux in hDAT cells and DA neurons. In contrast, perfusion of exogenous SYN1A (3 microM) into the cell with the whole-cell pipette enabled AMPH-induced DA efflux at -60 mV in both hDAT cells and DA neurons. It has been shown recently that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is activated by AMPH and regulates AMPH-induced DA efflux. Here, we show that AMPH-induced association between DAT and SYN1A requires CaMKII activity and that inhibition of CaMKII blocks the ability of exogenous SYN1A to promote DA efflux. These data suggest that AMPH activation of CaMKII supports DAT/SYN1A association, resulting in a mode of DAT capable of DA efflux.",

        "Abstract": "Eukaryotic neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs), targets for antidepressants and psychostimulants, terminate neurotransmission by sodium-driven reuptake. The crystal structure of LeuT(Aa), a prokaryotic NSS homolog, revealed an occluded state in which one leucine and two Na(+) ions are bound, but provided limited clues to the molecular mechanism of transport. Using steered molecular dynamics simulations, we explored the substrate translocation pathway of LeuT. We identified a second substrate binding site located in the extracellular vestibule comprised of residues shown recently to participate in binding tricyclic antidepressants. Binding and flux experiments showed that the two binding sites can be occupied simultaneously. The substrate in the secondary site allosterically triggers intracellular release of Na(+) and substrate from the primary site, thereby functioning as a \"symport effector.\" Because tricyclic antidepressants bind differently to this secondary site, they do not promote substrate release from the primary site and thus act as symport uncouplers and inhibit transport.",

        "Abstract": "Cocaine is a widely abused substance with psychostimulant effects that are attributed to inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT). We present molecular models for DAT binding of cocaine and cocaine analogs constructed from the high-resolution structure of the bacterial transporter homolog LeuT. Our models suggest that the binding site for cocaine and cocaine analogs is deeply buried between transmembrane segments 1, 3, 6 and 8, and overlaps with the binding sites for the substrates dopamine and amphetamine, as well as for benztropine-like DAT inhibitors. We validated our models by detailed mutagenesis and by trapping the radiolabeled cocaine analog [3H]CFT in the transporter, either by cross-linking engineered cysteines or with an engineered Zn2+-binding site that was situated extracellularly to the predicted common binding pocket. Our data demonstrate the molecular basis for the competitive inhibition of dopamine transport by cocaine.",

        "Abstract": "The dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) is a major molecular target of the psychostimulant amphetamine (AMPH). AMPH, as a result of its ability to reverse DAT-mediated inward transport of DA, induces DA efflux thereby increasing extracellular DA levels. This increase is thought to underlie the behavioral effects of AMPH. We have demonstrated previously that insulin, through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, regulates DA clearance by fine-tuning DAT plasma membrane expression. PI3K signaling may represent a novel mechanism for regulating DA efflux evoked by AMPH, since only active DAT at the plasma membrane can efflux DA. Here, we show in both a heterologous expression system and DA neurons that inhibition of PI3K decreases DAT cell surface expression and, as a consequence, AMPH-induced DA efflux.",

        "Abstract": "Drugs acting at dopamine D2-like receptors play a pivotal role in the treatment of both schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Recent studies have demonstrated a role for G-protein independent D2 receptor signaling pathways acting through beta-arrestin. In this study we describe the establishment of a Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) assay for measuring dopamine induced recruitment of human beta-arrestin2 to the human dopamine D2 receptor. Dopamine, as well as the dopamine receptor agonists pramipexole and quinpirole, acted as full agonists in the assay as reflected by their ability to elicit marked concentration dependent increases in the BRET signal signifying beta-arrestin2 recruitment to the D2 receptor. As expected from their effect on G-protein coupling and cAMP levels mediated through the D2 receptor RNPA, pergolide, apomorphine, ropinirole, bromocriptine, 3PPP, terguride, aripiprazole, SNPA all acted as partial agonists with decreasing efficacy in the BRET assay. In contrast, a wide selection of typical and atypical anti-psychotics was incapable of stimulating beta-arrestin2 recruitment to the D2 receptor. Moreover, we observed that haloperidol, sertindole, olanzapine, clozapine and ziprasidone all fully inhibited the dopamine induced beta-arrestin2 recruitment to D2 receptor (short variant) in a concentration dependent manner. We conclude that most anti-psychotics are incapable of stimulating beta-arrestin2 recruitment to the dopamine D2 receptor, in accordance with their antagonistic properties at the level of G-protein coupling.",

        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSS)(1) mediate sodium-dependent reuptake of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft and are targets for many psychoactive drugs. The crystal structure of the prokaryotic NSS protein, LeuT, was recently solved at high resolution; however, the mechanistic details of regulation of the permeation pathway in this class of proteins remain unknown. Here we combine computational modeling and experimental probing in the dopamine transporter (DAT) to demonstrate the functional importance of a conserved intracellular interaction network. Our data suggest that a salt bridge between Arg-60 in the N terminus close to the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment (TM) 1 and Asp-436 at the cytoplasmic end of TM8 is stabilized by a cation-pi interaction between Arg-60 and Tyr-335 at the cytoplasmic end of TM6. Computational probing illustrates how the interactions may determine the flexibility of the permeation pathway, and mutagenesis within the network and results from assays of transport, as well as the state-dependent accessibility of a substituted cysteine in TM3, support the role of this network in regulating access between the substrate binding site and the intracellular milieu. The mechanism that emerges from these findings may be unique to the NSS family, where the local disruption of ionic interactions modulates the transition of the transporter between the outward- and inward-facing conformations.",

        "Abstract": "Amphetamine (AMPH) is a widely abused psychostimulant that acts as a substrate for the human dopamine transporter (hDAT). Using a piezoelectric rapid application system, we measured AMPH-induced currents mediated by hDAT. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in a heterologous expression system reveal that AMPH induces a rapidly activating and subsequently decaying inward current mediated by hDAT. We hypothesize that this transient inward current reflects a conformational change associated with substrate translocation. The AMPH-induced current strictly depends on extracellular Na+. Elevated intracellular Na+ has no effect on the peak AMPH-induced current amplitude but inhibits the steady-state current. In addition, elevated intracellular Na+ causes an overshoot outward current upon washout of AMPH that reflects hDAT locked in a Na+-exchange mode. Furthermore, elevated intracellular Na+ dramatically accelerates the recovery time from desensitization of the AMPH-induced current, revealing a new role for intracellular Na+ in promoting the transition to the hDAT \"outward-facing\" conformation. Ion substitution suggests that both extracellular and intracellular Cl- facilitate transporter turnover in contrast to the classical model of Cl- as a cotransported ion. We present an alternating-access model of hDAT function that accurately fits the main features of the experimental data. The model predicts that translocation of substrate occurs within milliseconds of substrate binding but that slow reorientation of the empty transporter is the rate-limiting factor for turnover. The model provides a framework for interpreting perturbations of hDAT activity.",

        "Title": "Regulation of dopamine transporter function and cell surface expression by D3 dopamine receptors.",
        "Abstract": "D(3) dopamine receptors are expressed by dopamine neurons and are implicated in the modulation of presynaptic dopamine neurotransmission. The mechanisms underlying this modulation remain ill defined. The dopamine transporter, which terminates dopamine transmission via reuptake of released neurotransmitter, is regulated by receptor- and second messenger-linked signaling pathways. Whether D3 receptors regulate dopamine transporter function is unknown. We addressed this issue using a fluorescent imaging technique that permits real time quantification of dopamine transporter function in living single cells. Accumulation of the fluorescent dopamine transporter substrate trans-4-[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]-1-methylpyridinium (ASP(+)) in human embryonic kidney cells expressing human dopamine transporter was saturable and temperature-dependent. In cells co-expressing dopamine transporter and D3 receptors, the D2/D3 agonist quinpirole produced a rapid, concentration-dependent, and pertussis toxin-sensitive increase of ASP(+) uptake. Similar agonist effects were observed in Neuro2A cells and replicated in human embryonic kidney cells using a radioligand uptake assay in which binding to and activation of D3 receptors by [(3)H]dopamine was prevented. D3 receptor stimulation activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase and MAPK. Inhibition of either kinase prevented the quinpirole-induced increase in uptake. D3 receptor activation differentially affected dopamine transporter function and subcellular distribution depending on the duration of agonist exposure. Biotinylation experiments revealed that the rapid increase of uptake was associated with increased cell surface and decreased intracellular expression and increased dopamine transporter exocytosis. In contrast, prolonged agonist exposure reduced uptake and transporter cell surface expression. These results demonstrate that D3 receptors regulate dopamine transporter function and identify a novel mechanism by which D3 receptors regulate extracellular dopamine concentrations.",

        "Title": "Mechanism of chloride interaction with neurotransmitter:sodium symporters.",
        "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSS) have a critical role in regulating neurotransmission and are targets for psychostimulants, anti-depressants and other drugs. Whereas the non-homologous glutamate transporters mediate chloride conductance, in the eukaryotic NSS chloride is transported together with the neurotransmitter. In contrast, transport by the bacterial NSS family members LeuT, Tyt1 and TnaT is chloride independent. The crystal structure of LeuT reveals an occluded binding pocket containing leucine and two sodium ions, and is highly relevant for the neurotransmitter transporters. However, the precise role of chloride in neurotransmitter transport and the location of its binding site remain elusive. Here we show that introduction of a negatively charged amino acid at or near one of the two putative sodium-binding sites of the GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) transporter GAT-1 from rat brain (also called SLC6A1) renders both net flux and exchange of GABA largely chloride independent. In contrast to wild-type GAT-1, a marked stimulation of the rate of net flux, but not of exchange, was observed when the internal pH was lowered. Equivalent mutations introduced in the mouse GABA transporter GAT4 (SLC6A11) and the human dopamine transporter DAT (SLC6A3) also result in chloride-independent transport, whereas the reciprocal mutations in LeuT and Tyt1 render substrate binding and/or uptake by these bacterial NSS chloride dependent. Our data indicate that the negative charge, provided either by chloride or by the transporter itself, is required during binding and translocation of the neurotransmitter, probably to counterbalance the charge of the co-transported sodium ions.",

        "Abstract": "Transport proteins constitute approximately 10% of most proteomes and play vital roles in the translocation of solutes across membranes of all organisms. Their (dys)function is implicated in many disorders, making them frequent targets for pharmacotherapy. The identification of substrates for members of this large protein family, still replete with many orphans of unknown function, has proven difficult, in part because high-throughput screening is greatly complicated by endogenous transporters present in many expression systems. In addition, direct structural studies require that transporters be extracted from the membrane with detergent, thereby precluding transport measurements because of the lack of a vectorial environment and necessitating reconstitution into proteoliposomes for activity measurements. Here, we describe a direct scintillation proximity-based radioligand-binding assay for determining transport protein function in crude cell extracts and in purified form. This rapid and universally applicable assay with advantages over cell-based platforms will greatly facilitate the identification of substrates for many orphan transporters and allows monitoring the function of transport proteins in a nonmembranous environment.",

Although numerous recent studies have indicated that GPCRs can form multimeric complexes, the functional and pharmacological consequences of this phenomenon have remained elusive. With the discovery that the functional GABA(B) receptor is an obligate heterodimer and with the use of energy transfer technologies, it is now accepted that GPCRs can form heteromultimers. In some cases, specific properties of such heteromers not shared by their respective homomers have been reported. Although in most cases these properties have only been observed in heterologous expression systems, there are a few reports describing data consistent with such heteromultimeric GPCR complexes also existing in native tissues. The present article illustrates well-documented examples of such native multimeric complexes, lists a number of recommendations for recognition and acceptance of such multimeric receptors, and gives recommendations for their nomenclature.",

        "Abstract": "The dopamine transporter (DAT) terminates dopamine (DA) neurotransmission by reuptake of DA into presynaptic neurons. Regulation of DA uptake by D(2) dopamine receptors (D(2)R) has been reported. The high affinity of DA and other DAT substrates for the D(2)R, however, has complicated investigation of the intracellular mechanisms mediating this effect. The present studies used the fluorescent DAT substrate, 4-[4-(diethylamino)-styryl]-N-methylpyridinium iodide (ASP(+)) with live cell imaging techniques to identify the role of two D(2)R-linked signaling pathways, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) in mediating D(2)R regulation of DAT. Addition of the D(2)/D(3) receptor agonist quinpirole (0.1-10 muM) to human embryonic kidney cells coexpressing human DAT and D(2) receptor (short splice variant, D(2S)R) induced a rapid, concentration-dependent and pertussis toxin-sensitive increase in ASP(+) accumulation. The D(2)/D(3) agonist (S)-(+)-(4aR, 10bR)-3,4,4a, 10b-tetrahydro-4-propyl-2H,5H-[1]benzopyrano-[4,3-b]-1,4-oxazin-9-ol hydrochloride (PD128907) also increased ASP(+) accumulation. D(2S)R activation increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt, a major target of PI3K. The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor 2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (PD98059) prevented the quinpirole-evoked increase in ASP(+) accumulation, whereas inhibition of PI3K was without effect. Fluorescence flow cytometry and biotinylation studies revealed a rapid increase in DAT cell-surface expression in response to D(2)R stimulation. These experiments demonstrate that D(2S)R stimulation increases DAT cell surface expression and therefore enhances substrate clearance. Furthermore, they show that the increase in DAT function is ERK1/2-dependent but PI3K-independent. Our data also suggest the possibility of a direct physical interaction between DAT and D(2)R. Together, these results suggest a novel mechanism by which D(2S)R autoreceptors may regulate DAT in the central nervous system.",

        "Abstract": "Efflux of dopamine through the dopamine transporter (DAT) is critical for the psychostimulatory properties of amphetamines, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here we show that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a key role in this efflux. CaMKIIalpha bound to the distal C terminus of DAT and colocalized with DAT in dopaminergic neurons. CaMKIIalpha stimulated dopamine efflux via DAT in response to amphetamine in heterologous cells and in dopaminergic neurons. CaMKIIalpha phosphorylated serines in the distal N terminus of DAT in vitro, and mutation of these serines eliminated the stimulatory effects of CaMKIIalpha. A mutation of the DAT C terminus impairing CaMKIIalpha binding also impaired amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux. An in vivo role for CaMKII was supported by chronoamperometry measurements showing reduced amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux in response to the CaMKII inhibitor KN93. Our data suggest that CaMKIIalpha binding to the DAT C terminus facilitates phosphorylation of the DAT N terminus and mediates amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux.",

        "Abstract": "The recently elucidated crystal structure of a prokaryotic member of the neurotransmitter/sodium symporter (NSS) family (Yamashita et al., 2005) is a major advance toward understanding structure-function relationships in this important class of transporters. To aid in the generalization of these results, we present here a comprehensive sequence alignment of all known prokaryotic and eukaryotic NSS proteins, based on the crystal structure of the leucine transporter from Aquifex aeolicus (LeuT). Regions of low sequence identity between prokaryotic and eukaryotic transporters were aligned with the aid of a number of bioinformatics tools, and the resulting alignments were validated by comparison with experimental data. In a number of regions, including the transmembrane segments 4, 5, and 9 as well as extracellular loops 2, 3, and 4, our alignment differs from the one proposed previously [Nature (Lond) 437: 215-223, 2005]. Important similarities and differences among the sequences of NSS proteins in regions likely to determine selectivity in substrate binding and mechanisms of transport regulation are discussed in the context of the LeuT structure and the alignment.",

        "Title": "Functional selectivity and classical concepts of quantitative pharmacology.",
        "Abstract": "The concept of intrinsic efficacy has been enshrined in pharmacology for half of a century, yet recent data have revealed that many ligands can differentially activate signaling pathways mediated via a single G protein-coupled receptor in a manner that challenges the traditional definition of intrinsic efficacy. Some terms for this phenomenon include functional selectivity, agonist-directed trafficking, and biased agonism. At the extreme, functionally selective ligands may be both agonists and antagonists at different functions mediated by the same receptor. Data illustrating this phenomenon are presented from serotonin, opioid, dopamine, vasopressin, and adrenergic receptor systems. A variety of mechanisms may influence this apparently ubiquitous phenomenon. It may be initiated by differences in ligand-induced intermediate conformational states, as shown for the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor. Subsequent mechanisms that may play a role include diversity of G proteins, scaffolding and signaling partners, and receptor oligomers. Clearly, expanded research is needed to elucidate the proximal (e.g., how functionally selective ligands cause conformational changes that initiate differential signaling), intermediate (mechanisms that translate conformation changes into differential signaling), and distal mechanisms (differential effects on target tissue or organism). Besides the heuristically interesting nature of functional selectivity, there is a clear impact on drug discovery, because this mechanism raises the possibility of selecting or designing novel ligands that differentially activate only a subset of functions of a single receptor, thereby optimizing therapeutic action. It also may be timely to revise classic concepts in quantitative pharmacology and relevant pharmacological conventions to incorporate these new concepts.",

        "Abstract": "The gene of a novel prokaryotic member (Tyt1) of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family has been cloned from Fusobacterium nucleatum. In contrast to eukaryotic and some prokaryotic NSSs, which contain 12 transmembrane domains (TMs), Tyt1 contains only 11 TMs, a characteristic shared by approximately 70% of prokaryotic NSS homologues. Nonetheless upon heterologous expression in an engineered Escherichia coli host, Tyt1 catalyzes robust Na+-dependent, highly selective l-tyrosine transport. Genetic engineering of Tyt1 variants devoid of cysteines or with individually retained endogenous cysteines at positions 18 or 238, at the cytoplasmic ends of TM1 and TM6, respectively, preserved normal transport activity. Whereas cysteine-less Tyt1 was resistant to the inhibitory effect of sulfhydryl-alkylating reagents, N-ethylmaleimide inhibited transport by Tyt1 variants containing either one or both of the endogenous cysteines, and this inhibition was altered by the substrates sodium and tyrosine, consistent with substrate-induced dynamics in the transport pathway. Our findings support a binding model of Tyt1 function in which an ordered sequence of substrate-induced structural changes reflects distinct conformational states of the transporter. This work identifies Tyt1 as the first functional bacterial NSS member putatively consisting of only 11 TMs and shows that Tyt1 is a suitable model for the study of NSS dynamics with relevance to structure/function relationships of human NSSs, including the dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and gamma-aminobutyric acid transporters.",

        "Abstract": "Elucidation of protein function is greatly facilitated by the availability of an atomic resolution structure or a reliable molecular model. The difficulty of obtaining atomic resolution structures of membrane proteins in general, and of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in particular, has made the information available from sequence analysis, mutagenesis, and the literature on related GPCRs exceptionally important. Here, we review previous studies of GPCR structure-function from the perspectives of sequence analysis, management of mutagenesis and ligand binding data, and literature data mining. The knowledge derived from these information resources not only constitutes the prerequisites for reliable molecular modeling, but also can provide other insights into GPCR functions. Finally, we review approaches for information integration and applying knowledge discovery techniques to structure-function studies of GPCRs, including molecular modeling itself.",

        "Title": "Regulation of dopamine transporter trafficking by intracellular amphetamine.",
        "Abstract": "The dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) mediates the removal of released DA. DAT is the major molecular target responsible for the rewarding properties and abuse potential of the psychostimulant amphetamine (AMPH). AMPH has been shown to reduce the number of DATs at the cell surface, and this AMPH-induced cell surface DAT redistribution may result in long-lasting changes in DA homeostasis. The molecular mechanism by which AMPH induces trafficking is not clear. Because AMPH is a substrate, we do not know whether extracellular AMPH stimulates trafficking through its interaction with DAT and subsequent alteration in DAT function, thereby triggering intracellular signaling or whether AMPH must be transported and then act intracellularly. In agreement with our previous studies, extracellular AMPH caused cytosolic redistribution of the wild-type human DAT (WT-hDAT). However, AMPH did not induce cytosolic redistribution in an uptake-impaired hDAT (Y335A-hDAT) that still binds AMPH. The divalent cation zinc (Zn(2+)) inhibits WT-hDAT activity, but it restores Y335A-hDAT uptake. Coadministration of Zn(2+) and AMPH consistently reduced WT-hDAT trafficking but stimulated cytosolic redistribution of Y335A-hDAT. Furthermore, direct intracellular application of AMPH, via a whole-cell patch pipette, stimulated the trafficking of Y335A-hDAT. Taken together, these data suggest that the DAT transport cycle is not required for AMPH-induced down-regulation and that an increase of intracellular AMPH is an essential component of DAT redistribution.",

We have mapped the homodimer interface in the dopamine D2 receptor over the entire length of the fourth transmembrane segment (TM4) by crosslinking of substituted cysteines. Their susceptibilities to crosslinking are differentially altered by the presence of agonists and inverse agonists. The TM4 dimer interface in the inverse agonist-bound conformation is consistent with the dimer of the inactive form of rhodopsin modeled with constraints from atomic force microscopy. Crosslinking of a different set of cysteines in TM4 was slowed by inverse agonists and accelerated in the presence of agonists; crosslinking of the latter set locks the receptor in an active state. Thus, a conformational change at the TM4 dimer interface is part of the receptor activation mechanism.",

        "Title": "A pincer-like configuration of TM2 in the human dopamine transporter is responsible for indirect effects on cocaine binding.",
        "Abstract": "The second transmembrane segment (TM2) of DAT and other neurotransmitter transporters has been proposed to play a role in oligomerization as well as in cocaine binding. In an attempt to determine whether TM2 contributes to the binding site and/or transport pathway of DAT, we mutated to cysteine, one at a time, 25 residues in TM2 - from Phe98 to Gln122 - in an appropriate DAT background construct. Four of the mutants, F98C, G110C, P112C, and E117C, did not express at the cell surface, and G121C was inactive, despite its presence on the cell surface. Of the 21 mutants that expressed, none of the substituted cysteines reacted with MTSEA biotin-CAP, and none of the 20 functional mutants was sensitive to MTSEA or MTSET. Thus, TM2 does not appear to be water-accessible, based both on the lack of functional effects of charged MTS derivatives, and on the biochemical determination of lack of reaction with a biotinylated MTS derivative. This leads to the conclusion that TM2 does not contribute directly to the substrate-binding site or the transport pathway, and suggests that the observed effect of mutations in this region on cocaine binding is indirect. Three mutants, M106C, V107C and I108C, were crosslinked by treatment with HgCl(2). This crosslinking was inhibited by the presence of the cocaine analogue MFZ 2-12, likely due to a conformational rearrangement in TM2 upon inhibitor binding. However, the lack of crosslinking of cysteines substituted for Leu99, Leu113 and Leu120 - three of the residues that along with Met106 form a leucine heptad repeat in TM2 - makes it unlikely that this leucine repeat plays a role in symmetrical TM2 dimerization. Importantly, a high-resolution structure of LeuT, a sodium-dependent leucine transporter that is sufficiently homologous to DAT to suggest a high degree of structural similarity, became available while this manuscript was under review. We have taken advantage of this structure to explore further and interpret our experimental results in a rigorous structural context.",

        "Abstract": "The extracellular concentration of the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA and glycine is tightly controlled by plasma membrane transporters belonging to the SLC6 gene family. A very large number of putative transport proteins with a remarkable homology to the SLC6 transporters has recently been identified in prokaryotes. Here we have probed structural relationships in a 'microdoman' corresponding to the extracellular ends of transmembrane segments (TM) 7 and 8 in one of these homologs, the tryptophan transporter TnaT from Symbiobacterium thermophilum. We found that simultaneous - but not individual - substitution of Ala286 at the top of TM7 and Met311 at the top of TM8 with cysteines conferred sensitivity to submicromolar concentrations of Hg(2+) as assessed in a [(3)H]tryptophan uptake assay. Because Hg(2+) can cross-link pairs of cysteines, this suggests close proximity between TM 7 and 8 in the tertiary structure of TnaT as previously suggested for the mammalian counterparts. Furthermore, the inhibition of uptake upon cross-linking the two cysteines provides indirect support for a conserved conformational role of these transmembrane domains in the transport process. It was not possible, however, to transfer to TnaT binding sites for another metal ion, Zn(2+), that we previously engineered in the dopamine (DAT) and GABA (GAT-1) transporters between TM 7 and 8. This suggests that the structure of the TM7/8 microdomain is not identical with that of DAT and GAT-1. Hence, our data also emphasize possible structural differences that should be taken into account when interpreting future data on bacterial homologs of the SLC6 transporters.",

        "Abstract": "Plasma membrane neurotransmitter transporters for monoamines, GABA, glycine and excitatory amino acids are homologous to two sizable families of bacterial amino acid transporters. Recently, a high resolution structure was determined for a thermophilic glutamate transporter. Also, a bacterial tryptophan transporter related to the family of biogenic amine neurotransmitter transporters was functionally expressed. Structural insights from these and other bacterial transporters will help to rationalize the mechanisms for the increasingly complex functions that have been described for mammalian transporters, in addition to their modes of regulation. We touch on recent insights into the functions of neurotransmitter transporters in their physiological contexts.",

        "Title": "Amphetamine induces dopamine efflux through a dopamine transporter channel.",
        "Abstract": "Drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamine (AMPH), and heroin, elevate extracellular dopamine (DA) levels in the brain, thereby altering the activity/plasticity of reward circuits and precipitating addiction. The physiological release of DA occurs through the calcium-dependent fusion of a synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane. Extracellular DA is cleared by uptake through the Na+/Cl- -dependent DA transporter (DAT). In contrast, the substrate AMPH induces nonvesicular release of DA mediated by DAT. Extracellular AMPH is generally believed to trigger DA efflux through DAT by facilitating exchange for cytosolic DA. Here, in outside-out patches from heterologous cells stably expressing DAT or from dopaminergic neurons, by using ionic conditions in the patch pipette that mimic those produced by AMPH stimulation, we report that AMPH causes DAT-mediated DA efflux by two independent mechanisms: (i) a slow process consistent with an exchange mechanism and (ii) a process that results in rapid (millisecond) bursts of DA efflux through a channel-like mode of DAT. Because channel-like release of DA induced by AMPH is rapid and contains a large number of DA molecules, with a single burst of DA on par with a quantum of DA from exocytotic release of a vesicle, this burst mode of release may play a role in the synaptic actions and psychostimulant properties of AMPH and related compounds. Unlike AMPH, the endogenous substrate DA, when present on both sides of the plasma membrane, inhibits this channel-like activity, thereby suggesting that the DAT channel-like mode cannot accumulate DA against a concentration gradient.",

Evidence for this hypothesis has come from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, coimmunoprecipitation, resonance energy transfer, atomic force microscopy, and cross-linking studies, approaches that are reviewed in this article. Like any method, each has its strengths and limitations, and these must be kept in mind when interpreting the data for oligomerization. Recent experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that class A receptors may exist as higher-order oligomers, or even as arrays, with distinct symmetrical interfaces in both the first and fourth transmembrane segments.",

        "Title": "Surface targeting of the dopamine transporter involves discrete epitopes in the distal C terminus but does not require canonical PDZ domain interactions.",
        "Abstract": "The human dopamine transporter (hDAT) contains a C-terminal type 2 PDZ (postsynaptic density 95/Discs large/zona occludens 1) domain-binding motif (LKV) known to interact with PDZ domain proteins such as PICK1 (protein interacting with C-kinase 1). As reported previously, we found that, after deletion of this motif, hDAT was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and Neuro2A cells, suggesting that PDZ domain interactions might be critical for hDAT targeting. Nonetheless, substitution of LKV with SLL, the type 1 PDZ-binding sequence from the beta2-adrenergic receptor, did not disrupt plasma membrane targeting. Moreover, the addition of an alanine to the hDAT C terminus (+Ala), resulting in an LKVA termination sequence, or substitution of LKV with alanines (3xAla_618-620) prevented neither plasma membrane targeting nor targeting into sprouting neurites of differentiated N2A cells. The inability of +Ala and 3xAla_618-620 to bind PDZ domains was confirmed by lack of colocalization with PICK1 in cotransfected HEK293 cells and by the inability of corresponding C-terminal fusion proteins to pull down purified PICK1. Thus, although residues in the hDAT C terminus are indispensable for proper targeting, PDZ domain interactions are not required. By progressive substitutions with beta2-adrenergic receptor sequence, and by triple-alanine substitutions in the hDAT C terminus, we examined the importance of epitopes preceding the LKV motif. Substitution of RHW(615-617) with alanines caused retention of the transporter in the ER despite preserved ability of this mutant to bind PICK1. We propose dual roles of the hDAT C terminus: a role independent of PDZ interactions for ER export and surface targeting, and a not fully clarified role involving PDZ interactions with proteins such as PICK1.",

        "Abstract": "Although it is clear that amphetamine-induced dopamine (DA) release mediated by the dopamine transporter (DAT) is integral to the behavioral actions of this psychostimulant, the mechanism of this release is not clear. In this study, we explored the requirement for intracellular Ca(2+) in amphetamine-induced DA efflux and currents mediated by the human DAT. The patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration was used on Na(+) and DA-preloaded human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with the human DAT (hDAT cells). Chelation of intracellular Ca(2+) by inclusion of 50 microM BAPTA in the whole-cell pipette reduced the voltage-dependent amphetamine-induced hDAT current, with the greatest effect seen at positive voltages. Likewise, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) reduced amphetamine-induced DA efflux as measured by amperometry. Furthermore, preincubation of the cells with 50 microM BAPTA acetoxy methyl ester (AM) or thapsigargin also blocked amphetamine-induced release of preloaded N-methyl-4-[(3)H]phenylpyridinium from superfused hDAT cells. BAPTA-AM also reduced DA release from striatal synaptosomes. Amphetamine also led to an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) that was blocked by prior treatment with 5 microM thapsigargin or 10 microM cocaine. These studies demonstrate that amphetamine-induced DAT-mediated currents and substrate efflux require internal Ca(2+) and that amphetamine can stimulate dopamine efflux by regulating cytoplasmic Ca(2+) levels through its interaction with DAT.",

        "Abstract": "The structural basis of ligand affinity can be approached by studying the interactions between a drug and receptor residues; the basis for efficacy is more complex and must involve activation-associated conformational changes. We have used wild-type (WT), a constitutively active mutant (CAM), and a \"constitutively inactive\" mutant beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) to investigate changes in the binding site that accompany binding and activation. The active state (R(*)) probably involves repositioning of at least some of the agonist-contact residues, thereby optimizing their interactions with agonist and resulting in a higher affinity for agonist. A comparison of the binding affinities of a series of phenethylamine derivatives for WT revealed a remarkable synergism between the various functional groups present in epinephrine. Binding affinity was essentially unchanged with addition of beta-OH, N-CH(3), or catechol OHs to phenethylamine. In contrast, when each of these same groups was added to the appropriate compound, already containing the other two groups, to make epinephrine, the increase in affinity was quite large (60- to 120-fold). An initial interaction between two or more contacts may stabilize an intermediate conformation of beta(2)AR, R', either by altering amino acid side chain rotamer conformations or by a more global conformational change involving the repositioning of transmembrane segments. The pattern of these effects was different in the CAM in that fewer interactions were required to observe the synergistic effect, consistent with the hypothesis that the CAM mutation enriches the proportion of receptors in R(*) or in R' from which R(*) is more readily assumed.",

        "Title": "N-terminal phosphorylation of the dopamine transporter is required for amphetamine-induced efflux.",
        "Abstract": "Amphetamine (AMPH) elicits its behavioral effects by acting on the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) to induce DA efflux into the synaptic cleft. We previously demonstrated that a human DAT construct in which the first 22 amino acids were truncated was not phosphorylated by activation of protein kinase C, in contrast to wild-type (WT) DAT, which was phosphorylated. Nonetheless, in all functions tested to date, which include uptake, inhibitor binding, oligomerization, and redistribution away from the cell surface in response to protein kinase C activation, the truncated DAT was indistinguishable from the full-length WT DAT. Here, however, we show that in HEK-293 cells stably expressing an N-terminal-truncated DAT (del-22 DAT), AMPH-induced DA efflux is reduced by approximately 80%, whether measured by superfusion of a population of cells or by amperometry combined with the patch-clamp technique in the whole cell configuration. We further demonstrate in a full-length DAT construct that simultaneous mutation of the five N-terminal serine residues to alanine (S/A) produces the same phenotype as del-22-normal uptake but dramatically impaired efflux. In contrast, simultaneous mutation of these same five serines to aspartate (S/D) to simulate phosphorylation results in normal AMPH-induced DA efflux and uptake. In the S/A background, the single mutation to Asp of residue 7 or residue 12 restored a significant fraction of WT efflux, whereas mutation to Asp of residues 2, 4, or 13 was without significant effect on efflux. We propose that phosphorylation of one or more serines in the N-terminus of human DAT, most likely Ser7 or Ser12, is essential for AMPH-induced DAT-mediated DA efflux. Quite surprisingly, N-terminal phosphorylation shifts DAT from a \"reluctant\" state to a \"willing\" state for AMPH-induced DA efflux, without affecting inward transport. These data raise the therapeutic possibility of interfering selectively with AMPH-induced DA efflux without altering physiological DA uptake.",

        "Abstract": "Constitutive oligomer formation appears to be the rule for the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family of proteins. The propensity to form oligomers is a prerequisite for NSS proteins to pass the rigid mechanisms of quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, recent findings suggest that correct trafficking to the plasma membrane appears to rely on the interaction of NSS homo-oligomers with components of the COPII-vesicle machinery. The transporters present at the plasma membrane are most likely organized in a tetrameric arrangement, as a dimer of dimers. In this review, we will address ongoing efforts to unravel the underlying mechanisms of oligomer formation at the molecular and cellular levels, and we will discuss oligomerization in terms of transporter function.",

        "Title": "The second extracellular loop of the dopamine D2 receptor lines the binding-site crevice.",
        "Abstract": "The binding site of the dopamine D(2) receptor (D2R), like those of homologous rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that bind small molecules, is contained within a water-accessible crevice formed among its seven transmembrane segments (TMs). The high-resolution structure of bovine rhodopsin, however, revealed that the second extracellular loop (E2), which connects TM4 and TM5, folds down into the transmembrane domain and forms part of the ligand-binding surface for retinal. Whether E2 plays a related role in other rhodopsin-like GPCRs is unclear. To address this issue, we have now mutated to cysteine, one at a time, 10 consecutive residues in E2 of D2R. The reaction of five of these mutants with sulfhydryl reagents inhibited antagonist binding, and bound antagonist protected two, I184C and N186C, from reaction. The pattern of accessibility in E2 is consistent with a structure similar to that of bovine rhodopsin, in which the region C-terminal to the conserved disulfide bond is deeper in the binding-site crevice than is the N-terminal part of E2. Thus, E2 likely contributes to the binding site in the D2R and probably in other aminergic GPCRs as well. Knowledge of its detailed positioning and interactions with ligand would benefit GPCR molecular modeling and facilitate the design of novel drugs.",

        "Title": "Amphetamine regulation of dopamine transport. Combined measurements of transporter currents and transporter imaging support the endocytosis of an active carrier.",
        "Abstract": "Dopaminergic neurotransmission is fine-tuned by the rate of removal of dopamine (DA) from the extracellular space via the Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent DA transporter (DAT). DAT is a target of psychostimulants such as amphetamine (AMPH) and cocaine. Previously, we reported that AMPH redistributes the human DAT away from the cell surface. This process was associated with a reduction in transport capacity. This loss of transport capacity may result either from a modification of the function of DAT that is independent of its cell surface redistribution and/or from a reduction in the number of active transporters at the plasma membrane that results from DAT trafficking. To discriminate between these possibilities, we stably transfected HEK-293 cells with a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged human DAT (hDAT cells). In hDAT cells, acute exposure to AMPH induced a time-dependent loss of hDAT activity. By coupling confocal imaging with patch-clamp whole-cell recordings, we have demonstrated for the first time that the loss of AMPH-induced hDAT activity temporally parallels the accumulation of intracellular hDAT. In addition, presteady-state current analysis revealed a cocaine-sensitive, voltage-dependent capacitance current that correlated with the level of transporter membrane expression and in turn served to monitor the AMPH-induced trafficking of hDAT. We found that the decrease in hDAT cell surface expression induced by AMPH was not paralleled by changes in the ability of the single transporter to carry charges. Quasi-stationary noise analysis of the AMPH-induced hDAT currents revealed that the unitary transporter current remained unaltered during the loss of hDAT membrane expression. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the AMPH-induced reduction of hDAT transport capacity results from the removal of active hDAT from the plasma membrane.",

The biogenic amine transporters, a subset of this larger family, are especially intriguing as they are the targets for many psychoactive compounds, including cocaine and amphetamines, as well as many antidepressants. In the absence of a high-resolution structure for any transporter in this family, research into the structure-function relationships of these transporters has relied on analysis of the effects of site-directed mutagenesis as well as of chemical modification of reactive residues. The aim of this review is to establish a structural context for the experimental study of these transporters through various computational approaches and to highlight what is known about the conformational changes associated with function in these transporters. We also present a novel numbering scheme to assist in the comparison of aligned positions between sequences of the neurotransmitter transporter family, a comparison that will be of increasing importance as additional experimental data is amassed.",

        "Title": "Identification of intracellular residues in the dopamine transporter critical for regulation of transporter conformation and cocaine binding.",
        "Abstract": "Recently we showed evidence that mutation of Tyr-335 to Ala (Y335A) in the human dopamine transporter (hDAT) alters the conformational equilibrium of the transport cycle. Here, by substituting, one at a time, 16 different bulky or charged intracellular residues, we identify three residues, Lys-264, Asp-345, and Asp-436, the mutation of which to alanine produces a phenotype similar to that of Y335A. Like Y335A, the mutants (K264A, D345A, and D436A) were characterized by low uptake capacity that was potentiated by Zn(2+). Moreover, the mutants displayed lower affinity for cocaine and other inhibitors, suggesting a role for these residues in maintaining the structural integrity of the inhibitor binding crevice. The conformational state of K264A, Y335A, and D345A was investigated by assessing the accessibility to MTSET ([2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate) of a cysteine engineered into position 159 (I159C) in transmembrane segment 3 of the MTSET-insensitive \"E2C\" background (C90A/C306A). Unlike its effect at the corresponding position in the homologous norepinephrine transporter (NET I155C), MTSET did not inhibit uptake mediated by E2C I159C. Furthermore, no inhibition was observed upon treatment with MTSET in the presence of dopamine, cocaine, or Zn(2+). Without Zn(2+), E2C I159C/K264A, E2C I159C/Y335A, and E2C I159C/D345A were also not inactivated by MTSET. In the presence of Zn(2+) (10 microm), however, MTSET (0.5 mm) caused up to approximately 60% inactivation. As in NET I155C, this inactivation was protected by dopamine and enhanced by cocaine. These data are consistent with a Zn(2+)-dependent partial reversal of a constitutively altered conformational equilibrium in the mutant transporters. They also suggest that the conformational equilibrium produced by the mutations resembles that of the NET more than that of the DAT. Moreover, the data provide evidence that the cocaine-bound state of both DAT mutants and of the NET is structurally distinct from the cocaine-bound state of the DAT.",

        "Title": "The human dopamine transporter forms a tetramer in the plasma membrane: cross-linking of a cysteine in the fourth transmembrane segment is sensitive to cocaine analogs.",
        "Abstract": "Using cysteine cross-linking, we demonstrated previously that the dopamine transporter (DAT) is at least a homodimer, with the extracellular end of transmembrane segment (TM) 6 at a symmetrical dimer interface. We have now explored the possibility that DAT exists as a higher order oligomer in the plasma membrane. Cysteine cross-linking of wild type DAT resulted in bands on SDS-PAGE consistent with dimer, trimer, and tetramer, suggesting that DAT forms a tetramer in the plasma membrane. A cysteine-depleted DAT (CD-DAT) into which only Cys243 or Cys306 was reintroduced was cross-linked to dimer, suggesting that these endogenous cysteines in TM4 and TM6, respectively, were cross-linked at a symmetrical dimer interface. Reintroduction of both Cys243 and Cys306 into CD-DAT led to a pattern of cross-linking indistinguishable from that of wild type, with dimer, trimer, and tetramer bands. This indicated that the TM4 interface and the TM6 interface are distinct and further suggested that DAT may exist in the plasma membrane as a dimer of dimers, with two symmetrical homodimer interfaces. The cocaine analog MFZ 2-12 and other DAT inhibitors, including benztropine and mazindol, protected Cys243 against cross-linking. In contrast, two substrates of DAT, dopamine and tyramine, did not significantly impact cross-linking. We propose that the impairment of cross-linking produced by the inhibitors results from a conformational change at the TM4 interface, further demonstrating that these compounds are not neutral blockers but by themselves have effects on the structure of the transporter.",

        "Abstract": "The dopamine transporter (DAT) regulates the clearance of dopamine (DA) released into the extracellular space and is an important site on which psychostimulants act to produce their effects. Here, we show that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) regulates the transport capacity and intracellular trafficking of DAT. Incubation of striatal synaptosomes or epitope-tagged human DAT (hDAT) human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells with the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(o-aminophenylmercapto) butadiene and 2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one decreased DA uptake in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Kinetic studies revealed a decrease in the capacity of transport (Vmax) but no change in Km. Immunoblotting confirmed labeling of p42 and p44 MAPK in untreated striatal synaptosomes and HEK 293 cells, consistent with constitutive MAPK activation, and the inhibitors used decreased MAPK phosphorylation. Biotinylation and confocal imaging studies showed that MAPK inhibition promoted the clathrin-associated redistribution of hDAT from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. In contrast, transient transfection of hDAT-expressing cells with constitutively active MEK increased the Vmax of DA transport without altering Km. However, only a small increase in hDAT cell surface expression was seen. These data demonstrate an involvement of the MAPK cascade in regulating DAT transport capacity in striatum and that inhibition of this cascade decreases DAT cell surface expression in HEK 293 cells. Furthermore, they highlight the potential role of MAPK as a presynaptic mechanism that regulates DA signaling.",

        "Abstract": "Peroxynitrite and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are reactive nitrogen species that have been implicated as causal factors in neurodegenerative conditions. Peroxynitrite-induced nitration of tyrosine residues in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) may even be one of the earliest biochemical events associated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced damage to dopamine neurons. Exposure of TH to peroxynitrite or NO2 results in nitration of tyrosine residues and modification of cysteines in the enzyme as well as inactivation of catalytic activity. Dopamine (DA), its precursor 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, and metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid completely block the nitrating effects of peroxynitrite and NO2 on TH but do not relieve the enzyme from inhibition. o-Quinones formed in the reaction of catechols with either peroxynitrite or NO2 react with cysteine residues in TH and inhibit catalytic function. Using direct, real-time evaluation of tyrosine nitration with a green fluorescent protein-TH fusion protein stably expressed in intact cells (also stably expressing the human DA transporter), DA was also found to prevent NO2-induced nitration while leaving TH activity inhibited. These results show that peroxynitrite and NO2 react with DA to form quinones at the expense of tyrosine nitration. Endogenous DA may therefore play an important role in determining how DA neurons are affected by reactive nitrogen species by shifting the balance of their effects away from tyrosine nitration and toward o-quinone formation.",

Expression of the tnaT gene product in Escherichia coli conferred the ability to accumulate tryptophan from the medium and the ability to grow on tryptophan as a sole source of carbon. Transport was Na(+)-dependent and highly selective. The K(m) for tryptophan was approximately 145 nm, and tryptophan transport was unchanged in the presence of 100 microM concentrations of other amino acids. Tryptamine and serotonin were weak inhibitors with K(I) values of 200 and 440 microM, respectively. By using a T7 promoter-based system, TnaT with an N-terminal His(6) tag was expressed at high levels in the membrane and was purified to near-homogeneity in high yield.",

        "Abstract": "Amphetamine (AMPH) elicits its behavioral effects by acting on the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) to induce DA overflow into the synaptic cleft. Facilitated exchange diffusion is the classical model used to describe AMPH-induced DA efflux. This model hypothesizes that AMPH-induced DA efflux is mediated by DAT and results from the transport of AMPH into the cell followed by a counter movement of DA out to the extracellular compartment. To further characterize the action of AMPH, we used the patch clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration combined with amperometry on human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells stably transfected with the human DAT (DAT cells). In DAT cells, AMPH-induced DAT-mediated currents were blocked by cocaine. We demonstrate that DA efflux mediated by DAT is voltage-dependent, electrogenic, and dependent on intracellular Na(+) concentration in the recording electrode. Intracellular Na(+) fluorescence, as measured by confocal microscopy using a Na(+)-sensitive dye, was enhanced by AMPH application. Furthermore, the ability of AMPH to induce DA efflux was regulated by intracellular Na(+) concentration and correlated with the size of the DAT-mediated, AMPH-induced ion flux across the plasma membrane. In the absence of intracellular Na(+) but the presence of high intracellular Cl(-), AMPH-induced inward currents elicited DA efflux proportionally to their dimension and duration. Thus, we propose that AMPH-induced DA efflux depends on two correlated transporter processes. First, AMPH binds to the DAT and is transported, thereby causing an inward current. Second, because of this AMPH-induced inward current, Na(+) becomes more available intracellularly to the DAT, thereby enhancing DAT-mediated reverse transport of DA.",

Unraveling the structural mechanism for cross-talk between receptors in a dimeric complex must start with the identification of the presently unknown dimer interface. Here, by using cysteine cross-linking, we identify the fourth transmembrane segment (TM4) as a symmetrical dimer interface in the dopamine D2 receptor. Cross-linking is unaffected by ligand binding, and ligand binding and receptor activation are unaffected by cross-linking, suggesting that the receptor is a constitutive dimer. The accessibility of adjacent residues in TM4, however, is affected by ligand binding, implying that the interface has functional significance.",

Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) was achieved either directly by treatment with 4-alpha-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or by activating the Galpha(q)-coupled human substance P receptor (hNK-1) co-expressed with hDAT in HEK293 cells and in N2A neuroblastoma cells. In both cell lines, activation of the hNK-1 receptor by substance P reduced the V(max) for [(3)H]dopamine uptake to the same degree as did PMA ( approximately 50 and approximately 20% in HEK293 and N2A cells, respectively). In HEK293 cells, the reduction in transport capacity could be accounted for by internalization of the transporter, as assessed by cell surface biotinylation experiments, and by fluorescence microscopy using enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged hDAT. In HEK293 cells, hNK-1 receptor activation, as well as direct PKC activation by PMA, was accompanied by a marked increase in transporter phosphorylation. However, truncation of the first 22 N-terminal residues almost abolished detectable phosphorylation without affecting the SP- or PMA-induced reduction in transport capacity and internalization. In this background truncation construct, systematic mutation of all the phosphorylation consensus serines and threonines in hDAT, alone and in various combinations, did also not alter the effect of hNK-1 receptor activation or PMA treatment in either HEK293 or N2A cells. Mutation of a dileucine and of two tyrosine-based motifs in hDAT was similarly without effect. We conclude that the major phosphorylation sites in hDAT are within the distal N terminus, which contains several serines. Moreover, the present data strongly suggest that neither this phosphorylation, nor the phosphorylation of any other sites within hDAT, is required for either receptor-mediated or direct PKC-mediated internalization of the hDAT.",

        "Abstract": "In many rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors, agonist binding to a cluster of aromatic residues in TM6 may promote receptor activation by altering the configuration of the TM6 Pro-kink and by the subsequent movement of the cytoplasmic end of TM6 away from TM3. We hypothesized that the highly conserved Cys(6.47), in the vicinity of the conserved Pro(6.50), modulates the configuration of the aromatic cluster and the TM6 Pro-kink through specific interactions in its different rotamer configurations. In the beta(2) adrenergic receptor, mutation of Cys(6.47) to Thr, which in an alpha-helix has a different rotamer distribution from Cys and Ser, produced a constitutively active receptor, whereas the Ser mutant was similar to wild-type receptor. Use of the biased Monte Carlo technique of Conformational Memories showed that the rotamer changes among Cys/Ser/Thr(6.47), Trp(6.48), and Phe(6.52) are highly correlated, representing a rotamer \"toggle switch\" that may modulate the TM6 Pro-kink. Differential modulation of the accessibility of Cys(6.47) and an engineered Cys(6.52) in wild type and a constitutively active background provides experimental support for the association of this rotamer switch with receptor activation.",

        "Abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent neurotransmitter transporters exist as homo-oligomeric proteins. However, the functional implication of this oligomerization remains unclear. Here we demonstrate the engineering of a Zn(2+) binding site at the predicted dimeric interface of the dopamine transporter (DAT) corresponding to the external end of transmembrane segment 6. Upon binding to this site, which involves a histidine inserted in position 310 (V310H) and the endogenous Cys306 within the same DAT molecule, Zn(2+) potently inhibits [(3)H]dopamine uptake. These data provide indirect evidence that conformational changes critical for the translocation process may occur at the interface between two transporter molecules in the oligomeric structure.",

        "Title": "PI 3-kinase regulation of dopamine uptake.",
        "Abstract": "The magnitude and duration of dopamine (DA) signaling is defined by the amount of vesicular release, DA receptor sensitivity, and the efficiency of DA clearance, which is largely determined by the DA transporter (DAT). DAT uptake capacity is determined by the number of functional transporters on the cell surface as well as by their turnover rate. Here we show that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase with LY294002 induces internalization of the human DAT (hDAT), thereby reducing transport capacity. Acute treatment with LY294002 reduced the maximal rate of [(3) H]DA uptake in rat striatal synaptosomes and in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing the hDAT (hDAT cells). In addition, LY294002 caused a significant redistribution of the hDAT from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. Conversely, insulin, which activates PI 3-kinase, increased [(3)H]DA uptake and blocked the amphetamine-induced hDAT intracellular accumulation, as did transient expression of constitutively active PI 3-kinase. The LY294002-induced reduction in [(3)H]DA uptake and hDAT cell surface expression was inhibited by expression of a dominant negative mutant of dynamin I, indicating that dynamin-dependent trafficking can modulate transport capacity. These data implicate DAT trafficking in the hormonal regulation of dopaminergic signaling, and suggest that a state of chronic hypoinsulinemia, such as in diabetes, may alter synaptic DA signaling by reducing the available cell surface DATs.",

        "Abstract": "Peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) has been implicated as a causative factor in dopamine neuronal damage resulting from exposure to methamphetamine and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), and it may be involved in the etiology of Parkinson's Disease. ONOO(-) causes a concentration-dependent and irreversible reduction in dopamine uptake by EM4 cells stably expressing the human dopamine transporter (hDAT). The effect of ONOO(-) is manifested as a reduction in V(max). Cysteine, dithiothreitol, glutathione, and N-acetyl-cysteine, reagents that interact directly with ONOO(-), prevent this inhibition, whereas a scavenger of hydroxyl radical (dimethylsulfoxide), hydrogen peroxide (catalase), and superoxide (superoxide dismutase) did not. Dopamine in the extracellular medium protects the hDAT from ONOO(-), whereas intracellular dopamine does not. Parachloromercuribenzoic acid and 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA), which share with ONOO(-) the ability to modify cysteine sulfhydryls, also inhibit hDAT function. ONOO(-) treatment lowers cysteine-specific labeling of the hDAT by MTSEA-biotin, suggesting that ONOO(-) reacts with one or more cysteines in hDAT. A mutant of hDAT (X7C) in which all intracellular and extracellular loop cysteines were mutated was resistant to inhibition by ONOO(-). Sensitivity to ONOO(-) was restored in mutants of hDAT in which reduced cysteines were present only in the first (C135) and third (C342) intracellular loops (CD-DAT), or in which C342 alone had been reintroduced into X7C (X7C-M342C). These results indicate that the hDAT is inhibited by ONOO(-) through oxidation of cysteine 342. Our studies also substantiate the possibility that drugs known to decrease DAT function in vivo (e.g., methamphetamine and MPTP) may exert their effects through ONOO(-)-mediated oxidative stress.",

        "Abstract": "In HEK 293 cells expressing the human dopamine transporter (DAT), a 10-min incubation with 10 microM cocaine followed by extensive washing resulted in a 30% increase in [3H]dopamine (DA) uptake as well as an increase in cell surface DAT in biotinylation experiments. Consistent with this novel regulation, [3H]DA uptake into synaptosomes prepared from the nucleus accumbens of rats sacrificed 30 min after a single cocaine injection (30 mg/kg) was significantly increased compared to controls (56% increase in V(max), no change in K(m)). In addition, DA clearance in the striatum of anesthetized rats was increased after local application of a low (3 pmol) but not high (65 pmol) dose of cocaine, presumably as a result of mobilization of DAT to the cell surface. Cocaine-induced increases in cell surface expression of DAT and associated changes in DA clearance represent a novel mechanism that may play a role in its addictive properties.",

        "Abstract": "In the current chapter, we review approaches to the identification of the residues forming the binding sites for agonists, antagonists, and allosteric modulators in the family of aminergic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We then review the structural bases for ligand binding and pharmacological specificity based on the application of these methods to muscarinic cholinergic, adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and histaminergic receptors, using the high resolution rhodopsin structure as a template. Furthermore, we propose a critical role of the second extracellular loop in forming the binding site for small molecular weight aminergic ligands, much as this loop dives down into the binding-site crevice and contacts retinal in rhodopsin.",
