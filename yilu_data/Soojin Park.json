        "Title": "Common Data Elements for Disorders of Consciousness: Recommendations from the Working Group on Outcomes and \u00a0Endpoints.",
        "Abstract": "Clinical management of persons with disorders of consciousness (DoC) is dedicated largely to optimizing recovery. However, selecting a measure to evaluate the extent of recovery is challenging because few measures are designed to precisely assess the full range of potential outcomes, from prolonged DoC to return of preinjury functioning. Measures that are designed specifically to assess persons with DoC are often performance-based and only validated for in-person use. Moreover, there are no published recommendations addressing which outcome measures should be used to evaluate DoC recovery. The resulting inconsistency in the measures selected by individual investigators to assess outcome prevents comparison of results across DoC studies. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) common data elements (CDEs) is an amalgamation of standardized variables and tools that are recommended for use in studies of neurologic diseases and injuries. The Neurocritical Care Society Curing Coma Campaign launched an initiative to develop CDEs specifically for DoC and invited our group to recommend CDE outcomes and endpoints for persons with DoCs.",

This state called cognitive motor dissociation (CMD) is detectable by electroencephalogram (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging, predicts long-term recovery, and is recommended by recent guidelines to support prognostication. However, false negative CMD results are a particular concern, and occult aphasia in clinically unresponsive patients may be a major factor.

        "Abstract": "Human navigation heavily relies on visual information. Although many previous studies have investigated how navigational information is inferred from visual features of scenes, little is understood about the impact of navigational experience on visual scene representation. In this study, we examined how navigational experience influences both the behavioral and neural responses to a visual scene. During training, participants navigated in the virtual reality (VR) environments which we manipulated navigational experience while holding the visual properties of scenes constant. Half of the environments allowed free navigation (navigable), while the other half featured an 'invisible wall' preventing the participants to continue forward even though the scene was visually navigable (non-navigable). During testing, participants viewed scene images from the VR environment while completing either a behavioral perceptual identification task (Experimentl) or an fMRI scan (Experiment2). Behaviorally, we found that participants judged a scene pair to be significantly more visually different if their prior navigational experience varied, even after accounting for visual similarities between the scene pairs. Neurally, multi-voxel pattern of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) distinguished visual scenes based on prior navigational experience alone. These results suggest that the human visual scene cortex represents information about navigability obtained through prior experience, beyond those computable from the visual properties of the scene. Taken together, these results suggest that scene representation is modulated by prior navigational experience to help us construct a functionally meaningful visual environment.",

        "Title": "An Effective Catholyte for Sulfide-Based All-Solid-State Batteries Utilizing Gas Absorbents.",
        "Abstract": "All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) possess the advantage of ensuring safety while simultaneously maximizing energy density, making them suitable for next-generation battery models. In particular, sulfide solid electrolytes (SSEs) are viewed as promising candidates for ASSB electrolytes due to their excellent ionic conductivity. However, a limitation exists in the form of interfacial side reactions occurring between the SSEs and cathode active materials (CAMs), as well as the generation of sulfide-based gases within the SSE. These issues lead to a reduction in the capacity of CAMs and an increase in internal resistance within the cell. To address these challenges, cathode composite materials incorporating zinc oxide (ZnO) are fabricated, effectively reducing various side reactions occurring in CAMs. Acting as a semiconductor, ZnO helps mitigate the rapid oxidation of the solid electrolyte facilitated by an electronic pathway, thereby minimizing side reactions, while maintaining electron pathways to the active material. Additionally, it absorbs sulfide-based gases, thus protecting the lithium ions within CAMs. In this study, the mass spectrometer is employed to observe gas generation phenomena within the ASSB cell. Furthermore, a clear elucidation of the side reactions occurring at the cathode and the causes of capacity reduction in ASSB are provided through density functional theory calculations.",

        "Abstract": "Numerous challenges, like the uninterrupted supply of electricity, stable and reliable power, and energy storage during non-operational hours, arise across various industries due to the absence of advanced energy storage technologies. With the continual technological advancements in portable electronics, green energy, and transportation, there are inherent limitations in their innovative production. Thus, ongoing research is focused on pursuing sustainable energy storage technologies. An emerging solution lies in the development of asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs), which offer the potential to extend their operational voltage limit beyond the thermodynamic breakdown voltage range of electrolytes. This is achieved by employing two distinct electrode materials, presenting an effective solution to the energy storage limitations faced by ASCs. The current review concentrates on the progression of working materials to develop authentic pseudocapacitive energy storage systems (ESS). Also, evaluates their ability to exceed energy storage constraints. It provides insights into fundamental energy storage mechanisms, performance evaluation methodologies, and recent advancements in electrode material strategies. The review approaches developing high-performance electrode materials and achieving efficient ASC types. It delves into critical aspects for enhancing the energy density of ASCs, presenting debates and prospects, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding and design principles for next-generation ASCs in diverse applications.",

Although VHAs have enabled guided hemorrhage control therapies, improving clinical outcomes in life-threatening hemorrhage, the role of VHAs in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is unclear. If VHAs can identify coagulation abnormalities relevant for ICH outcomes, this would support the need to investigate the role of VHAs in ICH treatment paradigms.

        "Abstract": "Urban trees are often not considered in air-quality models although they can significantly impact the concentrations of pollutants. Gas and particles can deposit on leaf surfaces, lowering their concentrations, but the tree crown aerodynamic effect is antagonist, limiting the dispersion of pollutants in streets. Furthermore, trees emit Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOCs) that react with other compounds to form ozone and secondary organic aerosols. This study aims to quantify the impacts of these three tree effects (dry deposition, aerodynamic effect and BVOC emissions) on air quality from the regional to the street scale over Paris city. Each tree effect is added in the model chain CHIMERE/MUNICH/SSH-aerosol. The tree location and characteristics are determined using the Paris tree inventory, combined with allometric equations. The air-quality simulations are performed over June and July 2022. The results show that the aerodynamic tree effect increases the concentrations of gas and particles emitted in streets, such as NOx (+4.6\u00a0% on average in streets with trees and up to +37\u00a0% for NO",

        "Title": "Combined representation of visual features in the scene-selective cortex.",
        "Abstract": "Visual features of separable dimensions conjoin to represent an integrated entity. We investigated how visual features bind to form a complex visual scene. Specifically, we focused on features important for visually guided navigation: direction and distance. Previously, separate works have shown that directions and distances of navigable paths are coded in the occipital place area (OPA). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we tested how separate features are concurrently represented in the OPA. Participants saw eight types of scenes, in which four of them had one path and the other four had two paths. In single-path scenes, path direction was either to the left or to the right. In double-path scenes, both directions were present. A glass wall was placed in some paths to restrict navigational distance. To test how the OPA represents path directions and distances, we took three approaches. First, the independent-features approach examined whether the OPA codes each direction and distance. Second, the integrated-features approach explored how directions and distances are integrated into path units, as compared to pooled features, using double-path scenes. Finally, the integrated-paths approach asked how separate paths are combined into a scene. Using multi-voxel pattern similarity analysis, we found that the OPA's representations of single-path scenes were similar to other single-path scenes of either the same direction or the same distance. Representations of double-path scenes were similar to the combination of two constituent single-paths, as a combined unit of direction and distance rather than as a pooled representation of all features. These results show that the OPA combines the two features to form path units, which are then used to build multiple-path scenes. Altogether, these results suggest that visually guided navigation may be supported by the OPA that automatically and efficiently combines multiple features relevant for navigation and represent a navigation file.",

However, identifying its harmful thresholds and controlling ICP remain challenging in terms of improving outcomes. Evidence suggests that an individualized approach is necessary for establishing tolerance limits for ICP, incorporating factors such as ICP waveform (ICPW) or pulse morphology along with additional data provided by other invasive (e.g., brain oximetry) and noninvasive monitoring (NIM) methods (e.g., transcranial Doppler, optic nerve sheath diameter ultrasound, and pupillometry). This study aims to assess current ICP monitoring practices among experienced clinicians and explore whether guidelines should incorporate ancillary parameters from NIM and ICPW in future updates.",

        "Abstract": "The Korea Nurses' Health Study (KNHS) is an ongoing, large-scale, prospective cohort study of women nurses, focusing on the effects of occupational, environmental, and lifestyle factors on the health of women. The first KNHS survey was performed in 2013-2014 (n=20,613). As of December 2023, 11 follow-up surveys have been conducted. Participants who were pregnant were asked to participate in the early pregnancy survey (n=2,179) and postpartum survey after giving birth (n=2,790). The main variables included socio-demographic, work-related, lifestyle, physical, mental, and women's health factors. Blood, urine, and toenail samples were collected from a participant subgroup of the first survey (n=1,983). The subgroups of the second survey completed a food frequency questionnaire in 2019 (n=300) and 2021 (n=871). In 2020, a subgroup of the first survey answered a coronavirus disease 2019-related survey (n=975). To examine various health-related factors in young adults, new participants were added to the KNHS cohort in the 11th (n=1,000) and 12th (n=1,002) surveys. The KNHS cohort will help identify health and illness determinants in Korean women. Data can be accessed at https://coda.nih.go.kr/frt/index.do.",

        "Title": "Mitigating Gas Evolution in Electron Beam-Induced Gel Polymer Electrolytes Through Bi-Functional Cross-Linkable Additives.",
        "Abstract": "The current high-capacity lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), reliant on flammable liquid electrolytes (LEs) and nickel-rich cathodes, are plagued by safety hazards, especially the risk of hazardous gas release stemming from internal side reactions. To address these safety concerns, an electron beam (E-beam)-induced gel polymer electrolyte (E-Gel) is introduced, employing dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate (DPH) as a bi-functional cross-linkable additive (CIA). The dual roles of DPH are exploited through a strategically designed E-beam irradiation process. Applying E-beam irradiation on the pre-cycled cells allows DPH to function as an additive during the initial cycle, establishing a protective layer on the surface of the anode and cathode and as a cross-linker during the E-beam irradiation step, forming a polymer framework. The prepared E-Gel with CIA has superior interfacial compatibility, facilitating lithium-ion diffusion at the electrode/E-Gel interface. The electrochemical assessment of 1.2 Ah pouch cells demonstrates that E-Gel substantially reduces gas release by 2.5 times compared to commercial LEs during the initial formation stage and ensures superior reversible capacity retention even after prolonged cycling at 55\u00a0\u00b0C. The research underscores the synergy of bifunctional CIA with E-beam technology, paving the way for large-scale production of safe, high-capacity, and commercially viable LIBs.",

        "Abstract": "Orthodontic uprighting or traction of an impacted mandibular second molar often necessitates invasive interventions. This report aims to illustrate the utilization of nickel-titanium wire segments inserted into small, simple tubes for uprighting mesially impacted mandibular second molars and also for scissor bite correction. The term \"simple tube\" refers to a tube without a bonding base attached to a tooth surface by covering it with flowable composite resin. Due to the absence of a bonding base, the simple tube is characterized by its diminutive size and minimal profile height, facilitating placement on partially exposed second molars and unconventional positioning to adjust the force geometry. In this case study, mesially-impacted mandibular second molars with scissor bite were uprighted in a 21-year-old male utilizing simple tubes. Simple tubes can be used for molar uprighting and scissor bite correction buccally and lingually.",

        "Abstract": "Lithium metal anode (LMA) emerges as a promising candidate for lithium (Li)-based battery chemistries with high-energy-density. However, inhomogeneous charge distribution from the unbalanced ion/electron transport causes dendritic Li deposition, leading to \"dead Li\" and parasitic reactions, particularly at high Li utilization ratios (low negative/positive ratios in full cells). Herein, an innovative LMA structural model deploying a hyperporous/hybrid conductive architecture is proposed on single-walled carbon nanotube film (HCA/C), fabricated through a nonsolvent induced phase separation process. This design integrates ionic polymers with conductive carbon, offering a substantial improvement over traditional metal current collectors by reducing the weight of LMA and enabling high-energy-density batteries. The HCA/C promotes uniform lithium deposition even under rapid charging (up to 5\u00a0mA cm",

        "Abstract": "Epoxy resin is extensively applied in the electronics and electrical fields because of its outstanding comprehensive performance. However, the low thermal conductivity (TC) limits its application in thermal interface materials. In the present work, epoxy-based hybrid composites with high TC were prepared by using expanded graphite (EG) and copper (Cu) nanoparticles as thermally conductive hybrid fillers via hot blending and compression-curing processes. Additionally, the influence of the Cu content on the thermal properties, mechanical properties, and morphology of each epoxy/EG/Cu composite was investigated. According to the results, the epoxy/EG/Cu composite showed a maximum TC of 9.74 W/(m\u00b7K) at a fixed EG content of 60 wt % owing to the addition of 10 wt % Cu. After the addition of 10 wt % Cu, the flexural strength, flexural modulus, and impact strengths of epoxy/EG/Cu composites were improved from 27.9 MPa, 9.72 GPa, and 0.81 kJ/m",

        "Abstract": "The goals of the present study were to develop a simple method for obtain highly purified pig sperm hyaluronidase (pHyase) and to assess its activity, function, and safety. In mammals, sperm-specific glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored Hyase assists sperm penetration through the cumulus mass surrounding the egg and aids in the dispersal of the cumulus-oocyte complex. Recently, Purified bovine sperm hyaluronidase (bHyase) has been shown to enhance therapeutic drug transport by breaking down the hyaluronan barrier to the lymphatic and capillary vessels, thereby facilitating tissue absorption. Commercially available Hyase is typically isolated from bovine or ovine; which have several disadvantages, including the risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, low homology with human Hyase, and the requirement for relatively complex isolation procedures. This study successfully isolated highly purified pHyase in only two steps, using ammonium sulfate precipitation and fast protein liquid chromatography. The isolated Hyase had activity equal to that of commercial bHyase, facilitated in vitro fertilization, and effectively dissolved high molecule hyaluronic acid. This simple, effective isolation method could improve the availability of pHyase for research and clinical applications.",

        "Title": "Contemporary management of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. An update for the intensivist.",
        "Abstract": "Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) is a rare yet profoundly debilitating condition associated with high global case fatality and morbidity rates. The key determinants of functional outcome include early brain injury, rebleeding of the ruptured aneurysm and delayed cerebral ischaemia. The only effective way to reduce the risk of rebleeding is to secure the ruptured aneurysm quickly. Prompt diagnosis, transfer to specialized centers, and meticulous management in the intensive care unit (ICU) significantly improved the prognosis of aSAH. Recently, multimodality monitoring with specific interventions to correct pathophysiological imbalances has been proposed. Vigilance extends beyond intracranial concerns to encompass systemic respiratory and haemodynamic monitoring, as derangements in these systems can precipitate secondary brain damage. Challenges persist in treating aSAH patients, exacerbated by a paucity of robust clinical evidence, with many interventions showing no benefit when tested in rigorous clinical trials. Given the growing body of literature in this field and the issuance of contemporary guidelines, our objective is to furnish an updated review of essential principles of ICU management for this patient population. Our review will discuss the epidemiology, initial stabilization, treatment strategies, long-term prognostic factors, the identification and management of post-aSAH complications. We aim to offer practical clinical guidance to intensivists, grounded in current evidence and expert clinical experience, while adhering to a concise format.",

While VHAs have enabled guided hemorrhage control therapies, improving clinical outcomes in life-threatening hemorrhage, the role of VHAs in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is unclear. If VHAs can identify coagulation abnormalities relevant for ICH outcomes, this would support the need to investigate the role of VHAs in ICH treatment paradigms.

        "Abstract": "Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) are gaining attention as an ideal option for various applications requiring high-capacity batteries, such as portable electronics, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage. ZABs offer advantages such as low environmental impact, enhanced safety compared to Li-ion batteries, and cost-effectiveness due to the abundance of zinc. However, early research faced challenges due to parasitic reactions at the zinc anode and slow oxygen redox kinetics. Recent advancements in restructuring the anode, utilizing alternative electrolytes, and developing bifunctional oxygen catalysts have significantly improved ZABs. Scientists have achieved battery reversibility over thousands of cycles, introduced new electrolytes, and achieved energy efficiency records surpassing 70%. Despite these achievements, there are challenges related to lower power density, shorter lifespan, and air electrode corrosion leading to performance degradation. This review paper discusses different battery configurations, and reaction mechanisms for electrically and mechanically rechargeable ZABs, and proposes remedies to enhance overall battery performance. The paper also explores recent advancements, applications, and the future prospects of electrically/mechanically rechargeable ZABs.",

        "Abstract": "Sirtuin3 (Sirt3) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide enzyme that contributes to aging, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have reported that Sirt3 exerts anti-inflammatory effects in several neuropathophysiological disorders. As epilepsy is a common neurological disease, in the present study, we investigated the role of Sirt3 in astrocyte activation and inflammatory processes after epileptic seizures. We found the elevated expression of Sirt3 within reactive astrocytes as well as in the surrounding cells in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and a mouse model of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). The upregulation of Sirt3 by treatment with adjudin, a potential Sirt3 activator, alleviated SE-induced astrocyte activation; whereas, Sirt3 deficiency exacerbated astrocyte activation in the hippocampus after SE. In addition, our results showed that Sirt3 upregulation attenuated the activation of Notch1 signaling, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) activity, and the production of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL1\u03b2) in the hippocampus after SE. By contrast, Sirt3 deficiency enhanced the activity of Notch1/NF-\u03baB signaling and the production of IL1\u03b2. These findings suggest that Sirt3 regulates astrocyte activation by affecting the Notch1/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, which contributes to the inflammatory response after SE. Therefore, therapies targeting Sirt3 may be a worthy direction for limiting inflammatory responses following epileptic brain injury.",

        "Abstract": "Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a complication seen in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage stroke. It is a major predictor of poor outcomes and is detected late. Machine learning models are shown to be useful for early detection, however training such models suffers from small sample sizes due to rarity of the condition. Here we propose a Federated Learning approach to train a DCI classifier across three institutions to overcome challenges of sharing data across hospitals. We developed a framework for federated feature selection and built a federated ensemble classifier. We compared the performance of FL model to that obtained by training separate models at each site. FL significantly improved performance at only two sites. We found that this was due to feature distribution differences across sites. FL improves performance in sites with similar feature distributions, however, FL can worsen performance in sites with heterogeneous distributions. The results highlight both the benefit of FL and the need to assess dataset distribution similarity before conducting FL.",

        "Abstract": "Modern strides in energy storage underscore the significance of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) predicated on solid electrolytes and lithium (Li) metal anodes in response to the demand for safer batteries. Nonetheless, ASSBs are often beleaguered by non-uniform Li deposition during cycling, leading to compromised cell performance from internal short circuits and hindered charge transfer. In this study, the concept of \"bottom deposition\" is introduced to stabilize metal deposition based on the lithiophilic current collector and a protective layer composed of a polymeric binder and carbon black. The bottom deposition, wherein Li plating ensues between the protective layer and the current collector, circumvents internal short circuits and facilitates uniform volumetric changes of Li. The prepared functional binder for the protective layer presents outstanding mechanical robustness and adhesive properties, which can withstand the volume expansion caused by metal growth. Furthermore, its excellent ion transfer properties promote uniform Li bottom deposition even under a current density of 6 mA\u00b7cm",

        "Title": "Research considerations for prospective studies of patients with coma and disorders of consciousness.",
        "Abstract": "Disorders of consciousness are neurological conditions characterized by impaired arousal and awareness of self and environment. Behavioural responses are absent or are present but fluctuate. Disorders of consciousness are commonly encountered as a consequence of both acute and chronic brain injuries, yet reliable epidemiological estimates would require inclusive, operational definitions of the concept, as well as wider knowledge dissemination among involved professionals. Whereas several manifestations have been described, including coma, vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome and minimally conscious state, a comprehensive neurobiological definition for disorders of consciousness is still lacking. The scientific literature is primarily observational, and studies-specific aetiologies lead to disorders of consciousness. Despite advances in these disease-related forms, there remains uncertainty about whether disorders of consciousness are a disease-agnostic unitary entity with a common mechanism, prognosis or treatment response paradigm. Our knowledge of disorders of consciousness has also been hampered by heterogeneity of study designs, variables, and outcomes, leading to results that are not comparable for evidence synthesis. The different backgrounds of professionals caring for patients with disorders of consciousness and the different goals at different stages of care could partly explain this variability. The Prospective Studies working group of the Neurocritical Care Society Curing Coma Campaign was established to create a platform for observational studies and future clinical trials on disorders of consciousness and coma across the continuum of care. In this narrative review, the author panel presents limitations of prior observational clinical research and outlines practical considerations for future investigations. A narrative review format was selected to ensure that the full breadth of study design considerations could be addressed and to facilitate a future consensus-based statement (e.g. via a modified Delphi) and series of recommendations. The panel convened weekly online meetings from October 2021 to December 2022. Research considerations addressed the nosographic status of disorders of consciousness, case ascertainment and verification, selection of dependent variables, choice of covariates and measurement and analysis of outcomes and covariates, aiming to promote more homogeneous designs and practices in future observational studies. The goal of this review is to inform a broad community of professionals with different backgrounds and clinical interests to address the methodological challenges imposed by the transition of care from acute to chronic stages and to streamline data gathering for patients with disorders of consciousness. A coordinated effort will be a key to allow reliable observational data synthesis and epidemiological estimates and ultimately inform condition-modifying clinical trials.",

        "Abstract": "High-capacity silicon (Si) materials hold a position at the forefront of advanced lithium-ion batteries. The inherent potential offers considerable advantages for substantially increasing the energy density in batteries, capable of maximizing the benefit by changing the paradigm from nano- to micron-sized Si particles. Nevertheless, intrinsic structural instability remains a significant barrier to its practical application, especially for larger Si particles. Here, a covalently interconnected system is reported employing Si microparticles (5 \u00b5m) and a highly elastic gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) through electron beam irradiation. The integrated system mitigates the substantial volumetric expansion of pure Si, enhancing overall stability, while accelerating charge carrier kinetics due to the high ionic conductivity. Through the cost-effective but practical approach of electron beam technology, the resulting 500 mAh-pouch cell showed exceptional stability and high gravimetric/volumetric energy densities of 413 Wh kg",

        "Abstract": "Acute brain injuries, such as traumatic brain injury and ischemic and hemorragic stroke, are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. While characterized by clearly distict primary events-vascular damage in strokes and biomechanical damage in traumatic brain injuries-they share common secondary injury mechanisms influencing long-term outcomes. Growing evidence suggests that a more personalized approach to optimize energy substrate delivery to the injured brain and prognosticate towards families could be beneficial. In this context, continuous invasive and/or non-invasive neuromonitoring, together with clinical evaluation and neuroimaging to support strategies that optimize cerebral blood flow and metabolic delivery, as well as approaches to neuroprognostication are gaining interest. Recently, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine organized a 2-day course focused on a practical case-based clinical approach of acute brain-injured patients in different scenarios and on future perspectives to advance the management of this population. The aim of this manuscript is to update clinicians dealing with acute brain injured patients in the intensive care unit, describing current knowledge and clinical practice based on the insights presented during this course.",

        "Abstract": "Graphene, the most fascinating 2D form of carbon with closely packed carbon atoms arranged in a layer, needs more attention in various fields. For its unique electrical, mechanical, and chemical properties with a large surface area, graphene has been in the limelight since its first report. Graphene has extraordinary properties, making it the most promising electrode component for applications in supercapacitors. However, the persistent re-stacking of carbon layers in graphene, caused by firm interlayer van der Waals attractions, significantly impairs the performance of supercapacitors. As a result, many strategies have been used to get around the aforementioned problems. The utilization of graphene-based nanomaterials has been implemented to surmount the aforementioned constraints and considerably enhance the performance of supercapacitors. This review highlights recent progress in graphene-based nanomaterials with metal oxide, sulfides, phosphides, nitrides, carbides, and conducting polymers, focusing on their synthetic approach, configurations, and electrochemical properties for supercapacitors. It discusses new possibilities that could increase the performance of next-generation supercapacitors.",

        "Abstract": "The skin sensitization potential of agrochemicals can be assessed using laboratory methods such as the keratinocyte activation assay so that their use in regulatory toxicology might replace experimental animal testing. Here, we evaluated the skin sensitization potential of 11 agrochemicals by using an antioxidant response element-nuclear factor erythroid 2 luciferase assay in KeratinoSens and LuSens cells and applying a skin sensitization adverse outcome pathway (AOP). The KeratinoSens and LuSens assays consistently evaluated the skin sensitization potential of 10/11 agrochemicals with reference to animal testing databases. Benomyl, pretilachlor, fluazinam, terbufos, butachlor, and carbosulfan were correctly detected as sensitizers, and glufosinate ammonium, oxiadiazon, tebuconazole, and etofenprox were correctly detected as non-sensitizers. For diazinon, the skin sensitizing potential was positive in the KeratinoSens assay but not in the LuSens assay. These results suggest that the evaluation of in vitro skin sensitization using the AOP mechanism can be applied to assess active agrochemicals.",

        "Abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and refractory interstitial lung disease. Although there is no cure for IPF, the development of drugs with improved efficacy in the treatment of IPF is required. Daphnetin, a natural coumarin derivative, has immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. However, its antifibrotic effects have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the antifibrotic effects of daphnetin on pulmonary fibrosis and the associated molecular mechanism. We examined the effects of daphnetin on splenocytes cultured in Th17 conditions, lung epithelial cells, and a mouse model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. We identified that daphnetin inhibited IL-17A production in developing Th17 cells. We also found that daphnetin suppressed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in TGF-\u03b2-treated BEAS2B cells through the regulation of AKT phosphorylation. In BLM-treated mice, the oral administration of daphnetin attenuated lung histopathology and improved lung mechanical functions. Our findings clearly demonstrated that daphnetin inhibited IL-17A and EMT both in vitro and in vivo, thereby protecting against BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Taken together, these results suggest that daphnetin has potent therapeutic effects on lung fibrosis by modulating both Th17 differentiation and the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, and we thus expect daphnetin to be a drug candidate for the treatment of IPF.",

In the design of cross-linked network binders, careful selection of appropriate cross-linking agents is crucial to maintaining a balance between the robustness and functionality of the network.

This work has provided a strong grounding for the development of novel restorative therapeutic interventions. Although all interventions are aimed at modulating and thereby restoring brain function, the landscape of existing interventions encompasses a very wide scope of techniques and protocols. Despite vigorous research efforts, few approaches have been assessed with rigorous, high-quality randomized controlled trials. As a growing number of exploratory interventions emerge, it is paramount to develop standardized approaches to reporting results. The successful evaluation of novel interventions depends on implementation of shared nomenclature and infrastructure. To address this gap, the Neurocritical Care Society's Curing Coma Campaign convened nine working groups and charged them with developing common data elements (CDEs). Here, we report the work of the Therapeutic Interventions Working Group.",

        "Abstract": "To estimate the size of an indoor space, we must analyze the visual boundaries that limit the spatial extent and acoustic cues from reflected interior surfaces. We used fMRI to examine how the brain processes the geometric size of indoor scenes when various types of sensory cues are presented individually or together. Specifically, we asked whether the size of space is represented in a modality-specific way or in an integrative way that combines multimodal cues. In a block-design study, images or sounds that depict small- and large-sized indoor spaces were presented. Visual stimuli were real-world pictures of empty spaces that were small or large. Auditory stimuli were sounds convolved with different reverberations. By using a multivoxel pattern classifier, we asked whether the two sizes of space can be classified in visual, auditory, and visual-auditory combined conditions. We identified both sensory-specific and multimodal representations of the size of space. To further investigate the nature of the multimodal region, we specifically examined whether it contained multimodal information in a coexistent or integrated form. We found that angular gyrus and the right medial frontal gyrus had modality-integrated representation, displaying sensitivity to the match in the spatial size information conveyed through image and sound. Background functional connectivity analysis further demonstrated that the connection between sensory-specific regions and modality-integrated regions increases in the multimodal condition compared with single modality conditions. Our results suggest that spatial size perception relies on both sensory-specific and multimodal representations, as well as their interplay during multimodal perception.",

        "Abstract": "Frequent screening for thyroid cancer has been suggested as a probable explanation for the observed high risk of thyroid cancer in nuclear power plant (NPP) areas. We aimed to compare thyroid cancer screening rates of residents living near NPPs to those of the general population. This study utilized data from two national survey-based studies in 2016 and in 2014, respectively, for residents (n = 1,200) living in administrative districts within 5 km of NPP sites as the interest group, and the general population (n = 228,712) including distant-living residents (n = 19,100) in administrative districts within 30 km of NPP sites as reference groups. We observed an increase in screening rates in residents near NPPs, which may lead to a higher possibility of thyroid cancer detection. Therefore, further epidemiological studies investigating radiation-induced thyroid cancer risk among residents near NPPs should be carefully designed and interpreted considering possible detection bias.",

        "Abstract": "Transient receptor potential vanilloid 6 (TRPV6) is a highly selective calcium-ion channel that belongs to the TRPV family. TRPV6 is widely distributed in the brain, but its role in neurological diseases such as epilepsy remains unknown. Here, we report for the first time that TRPV6 expression is upregulated in the hippocampus of a pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus model, mainly in the suprapyramidal bundle of the mossy fiber (MF) projection of the hippocampal CA3 regions. We found that TRPV6 overexpression via viral vector transduction attenuated abnormal MF sprouting (MFS), whereas TRPV6 knockdown aggravated the development of MFS and the incidence of recurrent seizures during epileptogenic progression. In the in vitro experiments, our results showed that modulation of TRPV6 expression resulted in a change in axonal formation in cultured hippocampal neurons. In addition, we found that TRPV6 was implicated in the regulation of Akt-glycogen synthase kinase-3-\u03b2 activity, which is closely related to the cellular mechanism of axonal outgrowth. Therefore, these findings suggest that TRPV6 may regulate the formation of aberrant synaptic circuits during epileptogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "How continuous cerebral autoregulation (CCA) knowledge should be optimally gained and interpreted is still an active area of research and refinement. We now experience a unique situation of having indices clinically available before definitive evidence of benefit or practice guidelines, in a moment when high rates of institutional variability exist both in the application of monitoring as well as in monitoring-guided treatments. Responses from 47 international clinicians, experts in this field, were collected with polling and discussion of the results. The clinical use of CCA in critical illness was not universal among experts, with 34% not using it. Of those who use a CCA index in clinical practice, 64% use intracranial pressure-based Pressure Reactivity index\u00a0(PRx). There seems to exist a considerable trust in the physiologic plausibility of CCA to guide individual arterial blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure therapy and provide benefit, regardless of the difficulty of proving this. A total of 59% feel the need for phase II and III prospective studies but would continue to use CCA information in their practice even if randomized controlled trials (RCTs) did not show clear clinical benefit. There was nearly universal interest to participate in an RCT, with agreement that the research community must together determine end points and interventions to reduce wasted effort and time, and that investigations should include the following: the most appropriate way of inclusion of CCA into the clinical workflow; whether CCA-guided interventions should be prophylactic, proactive; or reactive; and whether a CCA-centric (unimodal) or a multimodal monitoring-integrated tiered therapy approach should be adopted. Pediatric and neonatal populations were highlighted as having urgent need and even more plausibility than adults. On the whole, the initiative was enthusiastically embraced by the experts, with the general feeling that a strong push should be now made by the community to convert the plausible benefits of CCA monitoring, already implemented in some centers, into a more standardized and RCT-validated clinical reality.",

        "Abstract": "Stealth technology is used to enhance the survival of military equipment in the field of military surveillance, as it utilizes a combination of techniques to render itself undetectable by enemy radar systems. Radar absorbing materials (RAMs) are specialized materials used to reduce the reflection (or absorption) of radar signals to provide stealth capability, which is a core component of passive countermeasures in military applications. The properties of RAMs can be optimized by adjusting their composition, microstructure, and surface geometry. Carbon-based materials present a promising approach for the fabrication of ultrathin, versatile, and high-performance RAMs due to their large specific surface area, lightweight, excellent dielectric properties, high electrical conductivity, and stability under harsh conditions. This review begins with a brief history of stealth technology and an introduction to electromagnetic waves, radar systems, and radar absorbing materials. This is followed by a discussion of recent research progress in carbon-based RAMs, including carbon blacks, carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes, graphite, graphene, and MXene, along with an in-depth examination of the principles and strategies on electromagnetic attenuation characteristics. Hope this review will offer fresh perspectives on the design and fabrication of carbon-based RAMs, thereby fostering a deeper fundamental understanding and promoting practical applications.",

There remains a pressing need for a more precise brain injury classification system that combines clinical semiology with neuroimaging, electrophysiologic, and other biomarker data. To address this need, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke launched the Common Data Elements (CDEs) initiative to facilitate systematic collection of high-quality research data in studies involving patients with neurological disease. The Neurocritical Care Society's Curing Coma Campaign expanded this effort in 2018 to develop CDEs for DoC. Herein, we present CDE recommendations for behavioral phenotyping of patients with DoC.",

Such data are considered part of the \"Big Data\" available in intensive care units and are potentially suitable for health care-focused artificial intelligence research. Despite the richness in content of the physiological measurements, and the clinical implications shown by derived metrics based on those measurements, they have been largely neglected from previous attempts in harmonizing data collection and standardizing reporting of results as part of common data elements (CDEs) efforts. CDEs aim to provide a framework for unifying data in clinical research and help in implementing a systematic approach that can facilitate reliable comparison of results from clinical studies in DoC as well in international research collaborations.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this investigation was to design the selection and ranking of dental restorative composite materials using hybrid Entropy-VIKOR as the MCDM method. Eleven performance defining attributes (PDAs) of dental composites were considered to investigate the best formulation among the dental composites. The weight criteria of various PDAs of the dental composite were calculated by the Entropy method: PDA-1(0.0527), PDA-2 (0.0113), PDA-3(0.1692), PDA-4(0.1291), PDA-5(0.0207), etc. The VIKOR method was employed to demonstrate the rank of dental composites. As per the VIKOR method, the first rank was obtained by DHZ6, the second rank was by DHZ8, the third rank was by DHZ4, the fourth rank was by DHZ2, and the lowest rank was by DHZ0. The Hybrid Entropy-VIKOR method holds significance in the biomedical realm due to its capability to effectively address complex decision-making scenarios. Its ability to account for multiple criteria, uncertainties, and compromise solutions makes it particularly useful for enhancing decision-making processes in the biomedical field, where selecting the most suitable options is critical for patient outcomes and healthcare advancements.",

        "Abstract": "Advanced energy-storage devices are indispensable for expanding electric mobility applications. While anion intercalation-type redox chemistry in graphite cathodes has opened the path to high-energy-density batteries, surpassing the limited energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries , a significant challenge remains: the large volume expansion of graphite upon anion intercalation. In this study,\u00a0a novel polymeric binder and cohesive graphite cathode design for dual-ion batteries (DIBs) is presented, which exhibits remarkable stability even under high voltage conditions (>5\u00a0V). The innovative binder incorporates an acrylate moiety ensuring superior oxidative stability and self-healing features, along with an azide moiety, which allows for azacyclic covalent bonding with graphite and interchain crosslinking. A simple 1-h ultraviolet treatment is sufficient for binder fixation within the electrode, leading to the covalent bond formation with graphite and the creation of a robust three-dimensional network. This modification facilitates deeper and more reversible anion intercalation, leading to improved capacity, extended lifespan, and sustainable anion storage.\u00a0The\u00a0binder design, exhibiting exceptional adhesive properties and effective stress mitigation, enables the construction of ultrathick graphite cathodes. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of advanced binders, paving the way for high-performance DIBs.",

        "Abstract": "Raloxifene hydrochloride shows poor bioavailability (only 2%) when orally administered because of its poor aqueous solubility and its extensive first-pass metabolism. A new micronized formulation of raloxifene was developed to improve bioavailability via enhanced gastrointestinal absorption. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a new micronized raloxifene formulation (AD-101) in comparison with the conventional raloxifene formulation. This study was designed as an open-label, randomized, 2-treatment-period, crossover study with a 2-week washout period. Two treatments consisted of micronized raloxifene 45\u00a0mg daily; and conventional raloxifene 60\u00a0mg daily administered in fasting conditions. Plasma raloxifene concentrations were determined by a validated method using ultra-fast liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a noncompartmental model. In total, 49 subjects completed the study. The geometric mean ratio (micronized/conventional) of the maximum concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last concentration values were 1.08 (90% CI, 0.95-1.24) and 0.97 (90% CI, 0.89-1.05), respectively. The adverse event profile did not differ between the 2 formulations. The results demonstrate that micronized formulation of raloxifene 45\u00a0mg is equivalent to conventional formulation of raloxifene 60\u00a0mg when administered at the single dose in the fasted state. After single oral dosing of AD-101, there were no serious or unexpected adverse events.",

        "Abstract": "The convergence of an interdisciplinary team of neurocritical care specialists to organize the Curing Coma Campaign is the first effort of its kind to coordinate national and international research efforts aimed at a deeper understanding of disorders of consciousness (DoC). This process of understanding includes translational research from bench to bedside, descriptions of systems of care delivery, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and ethical frameworks. The description and measurement of varying confounding factors related to hospital care was thought to be critical in furthering meaningful research in patients with DoC. Interdisciplinary hospital care is inherently varied across geographical areas as well as community and academic medical centers. Access to monitoring technologies, specialist consultation (medical, nursing, pharmacy, respiratory, and rehabilitation), staffing resources, specialty intensive and acute care units, specialty medications and specific surgical, diagnostic and interventional procedures, and imaging is variable, and the impact on patient outcome in terms of DoC is largely unknown. The heterogeneity of causes in DoC is the source of some expected variability in care and treatment of patients, which necessitated the development of a common nomenclature and set of data elements for meaningful measurement across studies. Guideline adherence in hemorrhagic stroke and severe traumatic brain injury may also be variable due to moderate or low levels of evidence for many recommendations. This article outlines the process of the development of common data elements for hospital course, confounders, and medications to streamline definitions and variables to collect for clinical studies of DoC.",

        "Abstract": "In unconscious appearing patients with acute brain injury, wilful brain activation to motor commands without behavioural signs of command following, known as cognitive motor dissociation (CMD), is associated with functional recovery. CMD can be detected by applying machine learning to EEG recorded during motor command presentation in behaviourally unresponsive patients. Identifying patients with CMD carries clinical implications for patient interactions, communication with families, and guidance of therapeutic decisions but underlying mechanisms of CMD remain unknown. By analysing structural lesion patterns and network level dysfunction we tested the hypothesis that, in cases with preserved arousal and command comprehension, a failure to integrate comprehended motor commands with motor outputs underlies CMD. Manual segmentation of T2-fluid attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion weighted imaging sequences quantifying structural injury was performed in consecutive unresponsive patients with acute brain injury (n = 107) who underwent EEG-based CMD assessments and MRI. Lesion pattern analysis was applied to identify lesion patterns common among patients with (n = 21) and without CMD (n = 86). Thalamocortical and cortico-cortical network connectivity were assessed applying ABCD classification of power spectral density plots and weighted pairwise phase consistency (WPPC) to resting EEG, respectively. Two distinct structural lesion patterns were identified on MRI for CMD and three for non-CMD patients. In non-CMD patients, injury to brainstem arousal pathways including the midbrain were seen, while no CMD patients had midbrain lesions. A group of non-CMD patients was identified with injury to the left thalamus, implicating possible language comprehension difficulties. Shared lesion patterns of globus pallidus and putamen were seen for a group of CMD patients, which have been implicated as part of the anterior forebrain mesocircuit in patients with reversible disorders of consciousness. Thalamocortical network dysfunction was less common in CMD patients [ABCD-index 2.3 (interquartile range, IQR 2.1-3.0) versus 1.4 (IQR 1.0-2.0), P < 0.0001; presence of D 36% versus 3%, P = 0.0006], but WPPC was not different. Bilateral cortical lesions were seen in patients with and without CMD. Thalamocortical disruption did not differ for those with CMD, but long-range WPPC was decreased in 1-4 Hz [odds ratio (OR) 0.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-0.9] and increased in 14-30 Hz frequency ranges (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.5). These structural and functional data implicate a failure of motor command integration at the anterior forebrain mesocircuit level with preserved thalamocortical network function for CMD patients with subcortical lesions. Amongst patients with bilateral cortical lesions preserved cortico-cortical network function is associated with CMD detection. These data may allow screening for CMD based on widely available structural MRI and resting EEG.",

        "Abstract": "Over the past 5 decades, advances in neuroimaging have yielded insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms that cause disorders of consciousness (DoC) in patients with severe brain injuries. Structural, functional, metabolic, and perfusion imaging studies have revealed specific neuroanatomic regions, such as the brainstem tegmentum, thalamus, posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and occipital cortex, where lesions correlate with the current or future state of consciousness. Advanced imaging modalities, such as diffusion tensor imaging, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and task-based fMRI, have been used to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and long-term prognosis, culminating in the endorsement of fMRI for the clinical evaluation of patients with DoC in the 2018 US (task-based fMRI) and 2020 European (task-based and resting-state fMRI) guidelines. As diverse neuroimaging techniques are increasingly used for patients with DoC in research and clinical settings, the need for a standardized approach to reporting results is clear. The success of future multicenter collaborations and international trials fundamentally depends on the implementation of a shared nomenclature and infrastructure.",

        "Abstract": "To estimate the size of an indoor space, we must analyze the visual boundaries that limit the spatial extent and acoustic cues from reflected interior surfaces. We used fMRI to examine how the brain processes geometric size of indoor scenes when various types of sensory cues are presented individually or together. Specifically, we asked whether the size of space is represented in a modality-specific way or in an integrative way that combines multimodal cues. In a block-design study, images or sounds that depict small and large sized indoor spaces were presented. Visual stimuli were real-world pictures of empty spaces that were small or large. Auditory stimuli were sounds convolved with different reverberation. By using a multi-voxel pattern classifier, we asked whether the two sizes of space can be classified in visual, auditory, and visual-auditory combined conditions. We identified both sensory specific and multimodal representations of the size of space. To further investigate the nature of the multimodal region, we specifically examined whether it contained multimodal information in a coexistent or integrated form. We found that AG and the right IFG pars opercularis had modality-integrated representation, displaying sensitivity to the match in the spatial size information conveyed through image and sound. Background functional connectivity analysis further demonstrated that the connection between sensory specific regions and modality-integrated regions increase in the multimodal condition compared to single modality conditions. Our results suggest that the spatial size perception relies on both sensory specific and multimodal representations, as well as their interplay during multimodal perception.",

        "Abstract": "Visual features of separable dimensions like color and shape conjoin to represent an integrated entity. We investigated how visual features bind to form a complex visual scene. Specifically, we focused on features important for visually guided navigation: direction and distance. Previously, separate works have shown that directions and distances of navigable paths are coded in the occipital place area (OPA). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we tested how separate features are concurrently represented in the OPA. Participants saw eight different types of scenes, in which four of them had one path and the other four had two paths. In single-path scenes, path direction was either to the left or to the right. In double-path scenes, both directions were present. Each path contained a glass wall located either near or far, changing the navigational distance. To test how the OPA represents paths in terms of direction and distance features, we took three approaches. First, the independent-features approach examined whether the OPA codes directions and distances independently in single-path scenes. Second, the integrated-features approach explored how directions and distances are integrated into path units, as compared to pooled features, using double-path scenes. Finally, the integrated-paths approach asked how separate paths are combined into a scene. Using multi-voxel pattern similarity analysis, we found that the OPA's representations of single-path scenes were similar to other single-path scenes of either the same direction or the same distance. Representations of double-path scenes were similar to the combination of two constituent single-paths, as a combined unit of direction and distance rather than pooled representation of all features. These results show that the OPA combines the two features to form path units, which are then used to build multiple-path scenes. Altogether, these results suggest that visually guided navigation may be supported by the OPA that automatically and efficiently combines multiple features relevant for navigation and represent a ",

However, the practical application of flexible LIBs in devices has been plagued by the challenge of simultaneously achieving high energy density and high flexibility. Herein, a hierarchical 3D electrode (H3DE) is introduced with high mass loading that can construct highly flexible LIBs with ultrahigh energy density. The H3DE features a bicontinuous structure and the active materials along with conductive agents are uniformly distributed on the 3D framework regardless of the active material type. The bicontinuous electrode/electrolyte integration enables a rapid ion/electron transport, thereby improving the redox kinetics and lowering the internal cell resistance. Moreover, the H3DE exhibits exceptional structural integrity and flexibility during repeated mechanical deformations. Benefiting from the remarkable physicochemical properties, pouch-type flexible LIBs using H3DE demonstrate stable cycling under various bending states, achieving a record-high energy density (438.6 Wh kg",

        "Abstract": "ConspectusWith the escalating demands of portable electronics, electric vehicles, and grid-scale energy storage systems, the development of next-generation rechargeable batteries, which boasts high energy density, cost effectiveness, and environmental sustainability, becomes imperative. Accelerating these advancements could substantially mitigate detrimental carbon emissions. The pursuit of main objectives has kindled interest in pure silicon as a high-capacity electroactive material, capable of further enhancing the gravimetric and volumetric energy densities compared with traditional graphite counterparts. Despite such promising attributes, pure silicon materials face significant hurdles, primarily due to their drastic volumetric changes during the lithiation/delithiation processes. Volume changes give rise to severe side effects, such as fracturing, pulverization, and delamination, triggering rapid capacity decay. Therefore, mitigating silicon particle fracture remains a primary challenge. Importantly, nanoscale silicon (below 150 nm in size) has shown resilience to stresses induced by repeated volume changes, thereby highlighting its potential as an anode-active material. However, the volume expansion stress not only affects the internal structure of the particle but also disrupts the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, formed spontaneously on the outer surface of silicon, causing adverse side reactions. Therefore, despite silicon nanoparticles offering new opportunities, overcoming the associated issues is of paramount importance.Thus, this Account aims to spotlight the significant strides made in the development of pure silicon anodes with particular attention to feature size. From the emergence of nanoscale silicon, the following nanotechnology played a crucial role in growing the particle through nano/microstructuring. Similarly, bulk silicon microparticles gradually surfaced with the post-engineering methods owing to their practical advantages. We briefly discuss the special characteristics of representative examples from bulk silicon engineering and nano/microstructuring, all aimed at overcoming intrinsic challenges, such as limiting large volume changes and stabilizing SEI formation during electrochemical cycling. Subsequently, we outline guidelines for advancing pure silicon anodes to incorporate high mass loading and high energy density. Importantly, these advancements require superior material design and the incorporation of exceptional battery components to ensure compatibility and yield synergistic effects. By broadening the cooperative strategies at the cell and system levels, we anticipate that this Account will provide an insightful analysis of pure silicon anodes and catalyze their practical applications in real battery systems.",

        "Abstract": "Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), an oral antiviral medication targeting SARS-CoV-2, remains an important treatment for COVID-19. Initial studies of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were performed in SARS-CoV-2 unvaccinated patients without prior confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, most individuals have now either been vaccinated and/or have experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection. After nirmatrelvir/ritonavir became widely available, reports surfaced of \"Paxlovid rebound,\" a phenomenon in which symptoms (and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity) would initially resolve, but after finishing treatment, symptoms and test positivity would return. We used a previously described parsimonious mathematical model of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection to model the effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment in unvaccinated and vaccinated patients. Model simulations show that viral rebound after treatment occurs only in vaccinated patients, while unvaccinated (SARS-COV-2 na\u00efve) patients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir do not experience any rebound in viral load. This work suggests that an approach combining parsimonious models of the immune system could be used to gain important insights in the context of emerging pathogens.",

        "Title": "Red Blood Cell Transfusions Are Not Associated With Incident Complications or Poor Outcomes in Patients With Intracerebral Hemorrhage.",
        "Abstract": "Background Anemia is associated with poor intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) outcomes, yet the relationship of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to ICH complications and functional outcomes remains unclear. We investigated the impact of RBC transfusion on hospital thromboembolic and infectious complications and outcomes in patients with ICH. Methods and Results Consecutive patients with spontaneous ICH enrolled in a single-center, prospective cohort study from 2009 to 2018 were assessed. Primary analyses assessed relationships of RBC transfusions on incident thromboembolic and infectious complications occurring after the transfusion. Secondary analyses assessed relationships of RBC transfusions with mortality and poor discharge modified Rankin Scale score 4 to 6. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for baseline demographics and medical disease severity (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II), and ICH severity (ICH score).Of 587 patients with ICH analyzed, 88 (15%) received at least one RBC transfusion. Patients receiving RBC transfusions had worse medical and ICH severity. Though patients receiving RBC transfusions had more complications at any point during the hospitalization (64.8% versus 35.9%), we found no association between RBC transfusion and incident complications in our regression models (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.42-1.20]). After adjusting for disease severity and other relevant covariates, we found no significant association between RBC transfusion and mortality (aOR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.45-1.66]) or poor discharge modified Rankin Scale score (aOR, 2.45 [95% CI, 0.80-7.61]). Conclusions In our cohort with ICH, RBC transfusions were expectedly given to patients with higher medical and ICH severity. Taking disease severity and timing of transfusions into account, RBC transfusion was not associated with incident hospital complications or poor clinical ICH outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as power sources for large-scale storage owing to their abundant and inexpensive sodium (Na) source, but their limited energy density hinders their commercialization. High-capacity anode materials, such as antimony (Sb), which are potential energy boosters for SIBs, suffer from battery degradation owing to large-volume-changes and structural instability. The rational design of bulk Sb-based anodes to enhance the initial reversibility and electrode density inevitably requires atomic- and microscale-considered internal/external buffering or passivation layers. However, unsuitable buffer engineering causes electrode degradation and lowers energy density. Herein, the rationally designed intermetallic inner and outer oxide buffers for bulk Sb anodes are reported. The two chemistries in the synthesis process provide an atomic-scale aluminum (Al) buffer within the dense microparticles and an external mechanically stabilizing dual oxide layer. The prepared nonporous bulk Sb anode maintained excellent reversible capacity at a high current density and Na-ion full battery evaluations with Na",

        "Title": "A Review on Interface Engineering of MXenes for Perovskite Solar Cells.",
        "Abstract": "With an excellent power conversion efficiency of 25.7%, closer to the Shockley-Queisser limit, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a strong candidate for a next-generation energy harvester. However, the lack of stability and reliability in PSCs remained challenging for commercialization. Strategies, such as interfacial and structural engineering, have a more critical influence on enhanced performance. MXenes, two-dimensional materials, have emerged as promising materials in solar cell applications due to their metallic electrical conductivity, high carrier mobility, excellent optical transparency, wide tunable work function, and superior mechanical properties. Owing to different choices of transition elements and surface-terminating functional groups, MXenes possess the feature of tuning the work function, which is an essential metric for band energy alignment between the absorber layer and the charge transport layers for charge carrier extraction and collection in PSCs. Furthermore, adopting MXenes to their respective components helps reduce the interfacial recombination resistance and provides smooth charge transfer paths, leading to enhanced conductivity and operational stability of PSCs. This review paper aims to provide an overview of the applications of MXenes as components, classified according to their roles as additives (into the perovskite absorber layer, charge transport layers, and electrodes) and themselves alone or as interfacial layers, and their significant importance in PSCs in terms of device performance and stability. Lastly, we discuss the present research status and future directions toward its use in PSCs.",

        "Abstract": "The efficient conductivity of graphene-polymer systems is expressed supposing graphene, tunneling and interphase components. The volume shares and inherent resistances of the mentioned components are used to define the efficient conductivity. Besides, the percolation start and the share of graphene and interphase pieces in the nets are formulated by simple equations. Also, the resistances of tunneling and interphase parts are correlated to graphene conductivity and their specifications. Suitable arrangements among experimented data and model's estimates as well as the proper trends between efficient conductivity and model's parameters validate the correctness of the novel model. The calculations disclose that the efficient conductivity improves by low percolation level, dense interphase, short tunnel, large tunneling pieces and poor polymer tunnel resistivity. Furthermore, only the tunneling resistance can govern the electron transportation between nanosheets and efficient conductivity, while the big amounts of graphene and interphase conductivity cannot play a role in the efficient conductivity.",

However, their energy-intensive nature and low efficiency have hindered their practical application. In this study, earth-abundant and non-toxic photocatalysts that can produce hydrogen and reform biomass efficiently, utilizing unlimited solar energy, are presented. The approach involves using low-bandgap Si flakes (SiF) for efficient light-harvesting, followed by modification with Ni-coordinated N-doped graphene quantum dots (Ni-NGQDs) to enable efficient and stable light-driven biomass reforming and hydrogen production.

        "Abstract": "Activated carbon fibers (ACFs) as one of the most important porous carbon materials are widely used in many applications that involve rapid adsorption and low-pressure loss, including air purification, water treatment, and electrochemical applications. For designing such fibers for the adsorption bed in gas and aqueous phases, in-depth comprehension of the surface components is crucial. However, achieving reliable values remains a major challenge due to the high adsorption affinity of ACFs. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach to determine London dispersive components (\u03b3SL) of the surface free energy of ACFs by inverse gas chromatography (IGC) technique at an infinite dilution. Our data reveal the \u03b3SL values at 298 K for bare carbon fibers (CFs) and the ACFs to be 97 and 260-285 mJ\u00b7m",

Carbon aerogels (CAs) with three-dimensional porous networks are promising materials for electrochemical energy storage applications. Physical activation using gaseous reagents provides controllable and eco-friendly processes due to homogeneous gas phase reaction and removal of unnecessary residue, whereas chemical activation produced wastes. In this work, we have prepared porous CAs activated by gaseous carbon dioxide, with efficient collisions between the carbon surface and the activating agent. Prepared CAs display botryoidal shapes resulting from aggregation of spherical carbon particles, whereas activated CAs (ACAs) display hollow space and irregular particles from activation reactions. ACAs have high specific surface areas (2503 m",

        "Abstract": "Spermatozoa have a streamlined shape to swim through the oviduct to fertilize oocytes. To become svelte spermatozoa, spermatid cytoplasm must be eliminated in several steps including sperm release, which is part of spermiation. Although this process has been well observed, the molecular mechanisms that underlie it remain unclear. In male germ cells, there are membraneless organelles called nuage, which are observed by electron microscopy in various forms of dense material. Reticulated body (RB) and chromatoid body remnant (CR) are two types of nuage in spermatids, but the functions of both are unknown. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we deleted the entire coding sequence of testis-specific serine kinase substrate (TSKS) in mice and demonstrate that TSKS is essential for male fertility through the formation of both RB and CR, prominent sites of TSKS localization. Due to the lack of TSKS-derived nuage (TDN), the cytoplasmic contents cannot be eliminated from spermatid cytoplasm in ",

        "Title": "Eugenol alleviates neuronal damage via inhibiting inflammatory process against pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus.",
        "Abstract": "Neuroinflammation is one of the most common pathological outcomes in various neurological diseases. A growing body of evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of epileptic seizures. Eugenol is the major phytoconstituent of essential oils extracted from several plants and possesses protective and anticonvulsant properties. However, it remains unclear whether eugenol exerts an anti-inflammatory effect to protect against severe neuronal damage induced by epileptic seizures. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory action of eugenol in an experimental epilepsy model of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). To examine the protective effect of eugenol via anti-inflammatory mechanisms, eugenol (200\u2009mg/kg) was administrated daily for three\u2009days after pilocarpine-induced SE onset. The anti-inflammatory action of eugenol was evaluated by examining the expression of reactive gliosis, pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), and the nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat with a pyrin-domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Our results showed that eugenol reduced SE-induced apoptotic neuronal cell death, mitigated the activation of astrocytes and microglia, and attenuated the expression of interleukin-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 in the hippocampus after SE onset. Furthermore, eugenol inhibited NF-\u03baB activation and the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the hippocampus after SE. These results suggest that eugenol is a potential phytoconstituent that suppresses the neuroinflammatory processes induced by epileptic seizures. Therefore, these findings provide evidence that eugenol has therapeutic potential for epileptic seizures.",

        "Abstract": "Previously, we found that dysfunctional natural killer (NK) cells with low interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) were restored in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by the FLT4 antagonist MAZ51. Here, we developed 12 peptides targeting FLT4 for clinical application and examined whether they restored the frequency of lymphocytes, especially T cells and NK cells, and high IFN-\u03b3 expression, as MAZ51 treatment did in our previous study. Although clinical data from using peptides are currently available, peptides targeting FLT4 to modulate immune cells have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we focus on novel peptide 4 (P4) from the intracellular domain of FLT4 because it had dominant negative activity. Similar to MAZ51, high IFN-\u03b3 levels were expressed in AML-mononuclear cells exposed to P4. Additionally, T and NK cell levels were restored, as were high IFN-\u03b3 levels, in a leukemic environment when P4 was treated. Interestingly, the regulatory T cells were significantly decreased by P4, implying the role of peptide in tumor niche. Overall, we demonstrated the therapeutic value of functionally modulating lymphocytes using a peptide targeting FLT4 and proposed the development of advanced therapeutic approaches against AML by using immune cells.",

The impressions of these factors on the effective concentration and percolation beginning of graphene nano-sheets in nanocomposites are also expressed. The developed equations for percolation beginning and conductivity are examined by the experimented data of some examples, which can guesstimate the interphase depth, tunneling size and percolation exponent. Besides, the impacts of numerous factors on the percolation beginning and conductivity are designed. The developed equation for percolation beginning shows the formation of thick interphase and large tunnels in the reported samples. So, disregarding of tunneling and interphase spaces in polymer graphene nanocomposites overpredicts the percolation beginning. Additionally, the developed model presents the acceptable calculations for the conductivity of samples. Among the mentioned parameters, the concentration and graphene conductivity in addition to the interphase depth induce the strongest effects on the conductivity of composites.",

        "Abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and refractory interstitial lung disease. Although there are two approved drugs for IPF, they were not able to completely cure the disease. Therefore, the development of new drugs is required for the effective treatment of IPF. In this study, we investigated the effect of theophylline, which has long been used for the treatment of asthma, on pulmonary fibrosis. The administration of theophylline attenuated the fibrotic changes of lung tissues and improved mechanical pulmonary functions in bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Theophylline treatment suppressed IL-17 production through inhibiting cytokines controlling Th17 differentiation; TGF-\u03b2, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-23. The inhibition of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 by theophylline is mediated by suppressing BLM-induced ROS production and NF-\u03baB activation in epithelial cells. We further demonstrated that theophylline inhibited TGF-\u03b2-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in epithelial cells through suppressing the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and AKT. The inhibitory effects of theophylline on the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and AKT were recapitulated in BLM-treated lung tissues. Taken together, these results demonstrated that theophylline prevents pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting Th17 differentiation and TGF-\u03b2 signaling.",

        "Abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women, which is also the second most public cancer worldwide. When detected early, BC can be treated more easily and prevented from spreading beyond the breast. In recent years, various BC biosensor strategies have been studied, including optical, electrical, electrochemical, and mechanical biosensors. In particular, the high sensitivity and short detection time of electrochemical biosensors make them suitable for the recognition of BC biomarkers. Moreover, the sensitivity of the electrochemical biosensor can be increased by incorporating nanomaterials. In this respect, the outstanding mechanical and electrical performances of graphene have led to an increasingly intense study of graphene-based materials for BC electrochemical biosensors. Hence, the present review examines the latest advances in graphene-based electrochemical biosensors for BC biosensing. For each biosensor, the detection limit (LOD), linear range (LR), and diagnosis technique are analyzed. This is followed by a discussion of the prospects and current challenges, along with potential strategies for enhancing the performance of electrochemical biosensors.",

        "Abstract": "With the rapid growth in the miniaturization and integration of modern electronics, the dissipation of heat that would otherwise degrade the device efficiency and lifetime is a continuing challenge. In this respect, boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) are of significant attraction as fillers for high thermal conductivity nanocomposites due to their high thermal stability, electrical insulation, and relatively high coefficient of thermal conductivity. Herein, the ambient plasma treatment of BNNS (PBNNS) for various treatment times is described for use as a reinforcement in epoxy nanocomposites. The PBNNS-loaded epoxy nanocomposites are successfully manufactured in order to investigate the thermal conductivity and fracture toughness. The results indicate that the PBNNS/epoxy nanocomposites subjected to 7 min plasma treatment exhibit the highest thermal conductivity and fracture toughness, with enhancements of 44 and 110%, respectively, compared to the neat nanocomposites. With these enhancements, the increases in surface free energy and wettability of the PBNNS/epoxy nanocomposites are shown to be attributable to the enhanced interfacial adhesion between the filler and matrix. It is demonstrated that the ambient plasma treatments enable the development of highly dispersed conductive networks in the PBNNS epoxy system.",

        "Title": "Positive/Negative Temperature Coefficient Behaviors of Electron Beam-Irradiated Carbon Blacks-Loaded Polyethylene Nanocomposites.",
        "Abstract": "Polymer-based materials with positive temperature coefficients (PTC) are regarded as potential candidates for electrical heating elements in a wide range of applications, such as wearable electronics, soft robots, and smart skin. They offer many advantages over ceramic or metal oxide-based composites, including low resistance at room temperature, excellent flexibility and processability, and low cost. However, the electrical resistance instability and poor reproducibility have limited their use in practical applications. In this work, we prepared carbon blacks-reinforced high-density polyethylene nanocomposites (CBs-HDPE) loaded with polar additives (polyols or ionomers), which were subsequently subjected to electron beam (EB) irradiation to explore their PTC behaviors. We found that the EB-treated nanocomposites exhibited PTC behaviors, while the untreated samples showed negative temperature coefficients. Further, EB-ionomer-CBs-HDPE showed the highest PTC intensity of 3.01 \u03a9\u00b7cm, which was \u223c35% higher than that of EB-CBs-HDPE. These results suggested that the EB irradiation enabled a specific volume expansion behavior via enhanced crosslinking among CBs, polar additives, and HDPE, inhibiting the formation of conductive networks in the nanocomposites. Thus, it can be concluded that polar additives and further EB irradiation played an important role in enhancing the PTC performances. We believe the findings provide crucial insight for designing carbon-polymer nanocomposites with PTC behaviors in various self-regulating heating devices.",

        "Abstract": "Cerebral multimodality monitoring (MMM) is, even with a general lack of Class I evidence, increasingly recognized as a tool to support clinical decision-making in the neuroscience intensive care unit (NICU). However, literature and guidelines have focused on unimodal signals in a specific form of acute brain injury. Integrating unimodal signals in multiple signal monitoring is the next step for clinical studies and patient care. As such, we aimed to investigate the recent application of MMM in studies of adult patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and hypoxic ischemic brain injury following cardiac arrest (HIBI). We identified continuous or daily updated monitoring modalities and summarized the monitoring setting, study setting, and clinical characteristics. In addition, we discussed clinical outcome in intervention studies. We identified 112 MMM studies, including 11 modalities, over the last 7\u00a0years (2015-2022). Fifty-eight studies (52%) applied only two modalities. Most frequently combined were ICP monitoring (92 studies (82%)) together with PbtO",

        "Abstract": "Hydrogels containing redox-sensitive colorimetric nanoparticles (NPs) have been used to sense ambient pH in many fields owing to their simple and fast visualization capabilities. However, real-time pH monitoring still has limitations due to its poor response rate and irreversibility. Herein, we developed a fast responsive colorimetric hydrogel called ferrocene adsorption colorimetric hydrogel (FACH). Ferrocene, an organometallic compound, plays a vital role as an electron transfer mediator (i.e., redox catalyst) within the hydrogel network. FACH shows fast color change performance with high reactivity and penetrability to ambient pH changes. In detail, FACH shows distinct color change within 2 min under various pH conditions from four to eight, with good reliability. The speed for color change of FACH is approximately six times faster than that of previously developed colorimetric hydrogels, suggesting the fastest hydrogel-based colorimetric pH sensor. Furthermore, FACH shows reversibility and repeatability of the redox process, indicating scalable utility as a sustainable pH monitoring platform.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetes mellitus has become a worldwide epidemic, and it is expected to become the seventh leading cause of death by 2030. In response to the increasing number of diabetes patients worldwide, glucose biosensors with high sensitivity and selectivity have been developed for rapid detection. The selectivity, high sensitivity, simplicity, and quick response of electrochemical biosensors have made them a popular choice in recent years. This review summarizes the recent developments in electrodes for non-enzymatic glucose detection using carbon nanofiber (CNF)-based nanocomposites. The electrochemical performance and limitations of enzymatic and non-enzymatic glucose biosensors are reviewed. Then, the recent developments in non-enzymatic glucose biosensors using CNF composites are discussed. The final section of the review provides a summary of the challenges and perspectives, for progress in non-enzymatic glucose biosensors.",

Humans can process a limited number of variables at any given time. Thus, the deluge of clinically useful information in the intensive care unit environment remains untapped. Innovations in machine learning technology with the development of deep neural networks and efficient, cost-effective data archival systems have provided the infrastructure to apply artificial intelligence on big data for determination of clinical events and outcomes. Here, we introduce a few computer-based technologies that have been tested across these domains.",

        "Abstract": "Despite substantial advances in disease genetics, studies to date have largely focused on individuals of European descent. This limits further discoveries of novel functional genetic variants in other ethnic groups. To alleviate the paucity of East Asian population genome resources, we established the Korean Variant Archive 2 (KOVA 2), which is composed of 1896 whole-genome sequences and 3409 whole-exome sequences from healthy individuals of Korean ethnicity. This is the largest genome database from the ethnic Korean population to date, surpassing the 1909 Korean individuals deposited in gnomAD. The variants in KOVA 2 displayed all the known genetic features of those from previous genome databases, and we compiled data from Korean-specific runs of homozygosity, positively selected intervals, and structural variants. In doing so, we found loci, such as the loci of ADH1A/1B and UHRF1BP1, that are strongly selected in the Korean population relative to other East Asian populations. Our analysis of allele ages revealed a correlation between variant functionality and evolutionary age. The data can be browsed and downloaded from a public website ( https://www.kobic.re.kr/kova/ ). We anticipate that KOVA 2 will serve as a valuable resource for genetic studies involving East Asian populations.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, the development of energy storage devices has received much attention due to the increasing demand for renewable energy. Supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted considerable attention among various energy storage devices due to their high specific capacity, high power density, long cycle life, economic efficiency, environmental friendliness, high safety, and fast charge/discharge rates. SCs are devices that can store large amounts of electrical energy and release it quickly, making them ideal for use in a wide range of applications. They are often used in conjunction with batteries to provide a power boost when needed and can also be used as a standalone power source. They can be used in various potential applications, such as portable equipment, smart electronic systems, electric vehicles, and grid energy storage systems. There are a variety of materials that have been studied for use as SC electrodes, each with its advantages and limitations. The electrode material must have a high surface area to volume ratio to enable high energy storage densities. Additionally, the electrode material must be highly conductive to enable efficient charge transfer. Over the past several years, several novel materials have been developed which can be used to improve the capacitance of the SCs. This article reviews three types of SCs: electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), pseudocapacitors, and hybrid supercapacitors, their respective development, energy storage mechanisms, and the latest research progress in material preparation and modification. In addition, it proposes potentially feasible solutions to the problems encountered during the development of supercapacitors and looks forward to the future development direction of SCs.",

        "Abstract": "Despite recent advancements in our understanding of genetic etiology and its molecular and physiological consequences, it is not yet clear what genetic features determine the inheritance pattern of a disease. To address this issue, we conducted whole exome sequencing analysis to characterize genetic variants in 1,180 Korean patients with neurological symptoms. The diagnostic yield for definitive pathogenic variant findings was 50.8%, after including 33 cases (5.9%) additionally diagnosed by reanalysis. Of diagnosed patients, 33.4% carried inherited variants. At the genetic level, autosomal recessive-inherited genes were characterized by enrichments in metabolic process, muscle organization and metal ion homeostasis pathways. Transcriptome and interactome profiling analyses revealed less brain-centered expression and fewer protein-protein interactions for recessive genes. The majority of autosomal recessive genes were more tolerant of variation, and functional prediction scores of recessively-inherited variants tended to be lower than those of dominantly-inherited variants. Additionally, we were able to predict the rates of carriers for recessive variants. Our results showed that genes responsible for neurodevelopmental disorders harbor different molecular mechanisms and expression patterns according to their inheritance patterns. Also, calculated frequency rates for recessive variants could be utilized to pre-screen rare neurodevelopmental disorder carriers.",

        "Abstract": "Photocatalytic technology is widely explored as a promising alternative for water treatments. However, low photocatalytic efficiency and selectivity usually limit its practical application. Herein, we develop the synthesis of two-dimensional zinc oxide (ZnO) nanosheets decorated with copper (Cu)-palladium (Pd) bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) for the degradation of organic dyes in an aqueous solution. Compared to pristine ZnO nanosheets, the prepared CuPd/ZnO composites exhibited superior performance for the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes under visible-light irradiation. The remarkable improvement of degradation activity was attributable to the enhanced separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. The highest catalytic efficiency of CuPd/ZnO nanocomposite with the CuPd content of 0.5\u00a0wt% exhibited 95.3% removal of methyl orange (MO) (40\u00a0mg/L) within 45\u00a0min. From the experimental data, we believe this study provides a new avenue for the design and fabrication of high-performance photocatalysts capable of water treatments.",

        "Abstract": "Wearable electronics is a growing field that has important applications in advanced human-integrated systems with high performance and mechanical deformability, especially foldable characteristics. Although foldable electronics such as rollable TVs (LG signature OLED R) or foldable smartphones (Samsung Galaxy Z fold/flip series) have been successfully established in the market, these devices are still powered by rigid and stiff batteries. Therefore, to realize fully wearable devices, it is necessary to develop state-of-the-art foldable batteries with high performance and safety in dynamic deformation states. In this review, we cover the recent progress in developing materials and system designs for foldable batteries. The Materials section is divided into three sections aimed at helping researchers choose suitable materials for their systems. Several foldable battery systems are discussed and the combination of innovative materials and system design that yields successful devices is considered. Furthermore, the basic analysis process of electrochemical and mechanical properties is provided as a guide for researchers interested in the evaluation of foldable battery systems. The current challenges facing the practical application of foldable batteries are briefly discussed. This review will help researchers to understand various aspects (from material preparation to battery configuration) of foldable batteries and provide a brief guideline for evaluating the performance of these batteries.",

        "Abstract": "Epoxy-based nanocomposites can be ideal electromagnetic interference (EMI)-shielding materials owing to their lightness, chemical inertness, and mechanical durability. However, poor conductivity and brittleness of the epoxy resin are challenges for fast-growing portable and flexible EMI-shielding applications, such as smart wristband, medical cloth, aerospace, and military equipment. In this study, we explored hybrid nanofillers of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as conductive inks and polyester fabrics (PFs) as a substrate for flexible EMI-shielding composites. The highest electrical conductivity and fracture toughness of the SWCNT/rGO/PF/epoxy composites were 30.2\u00a0S\u00a0m",

However, commercialization-worthy efficiency and long-term stability remain a challenge. In this regard, there are increasing studies focusing on the interface engineering in PSC devices to overcome their poor technical readiness. Herein, the roles of electrode materials and interfaces in PSCs are discussed in terms of their PCEs and perovskite stability. All the current knowledge on the factors responsible for the rapid intrinsic and external degradation of PSCs is presented. Then, the roles of carbonaceous materials as substitutes for noble metals are focused on, along with the recent research progress in carbon-based PSCs. Furthermore, a sub-category of PSCs, that is, flexible PSCs, is considered as a type of exceptional power source due to their high power-to-weight ratios and figures of merit for next-generation wearable electronics. Last, the future perspectives and directions for research in PSCs are discussed, with an emphasis on their commercialization.",

To date, they are still limited by relatively poor energy volumetric performances, which are largely determined by the pore structures and physicochemical properties of electrode materials. Moreover, the poor mechanical properties afforded because of the intrinsic shortcomings of electrode materials need to be resolved. Herein, we designed a flexible and solid-state yarn electrode with high porosity and high affinity toward electrolytes using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and Korean heritage paper (KHP). To maximize the volumetric capacitive energy storage, PEDOT-loaded conductive KHP sheets (two-dimensional) were transformed into a biscrolled yarn (one-dimensional) ",

        "Title": "Spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage.",
        "Abstract": "Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is the third most common subtype of stroke. Incidence has decreased over past decades, possibly in part related to lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation and management of hypertension. Approximately a quarter of patients with SAH die before hospital admission; overall outcomes are improved in those admitted to hospital, but with elevated risk of long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae such as depression. The disease continues to have a major public health impact as the mean age of onset is in the mid-fifties, leading to many years of reduced quality of life. The clinical presentation varies, but severe, sudden onset of headache is the most common symptom, variably associated with meningismus, transient or prolonged unconsciousness, and focal neurological deficits including cranial nerve palsies and paresis. Diagnosis is made by CT scan of the head possibly followed by lumbar puncture. Aneurysms are commonly the underlying vascular cause of spontaneous SAH and are diagnosed by angiography. Emergent therapeutic interventions are focused on decreasing the risk of rebleeding (ie, preventing hypertension and correcting coagulopathies) and, most crucially, early aneurysm treatment using coil embolisation or clipping. Management of the disease is best delivered in specialised intensive care units and high-volume centres by a multidisciplinary team. Increasingly, early brain injury presenting as global cerebral oedema is recognised as a potential treatment target but, currently, disease management is largely focused on addressing secondary complications such as hydrocephalus, delayed cerebral ischaemia related to microvascular dysfunction and large vessel vasospasm, and medical complications such as stunned myocardium and hospital acquired infections.",

        "Abstract": "Graphene is of great interest for many far-reaching applications that involve interparticle interactions in adsorbents, coatings, and composites. A deep understanding of the surface components has been crucial but achieving the most accurate and reliable values of these, unaffected by experimental conditions or the analytical techniques used, remains a major challenge. To this end, we have proposed in this paper a novel approach for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, to determine London dispersive and specific (polar) components including the Lewis acid-base character of the surface free energy of graphene materials (graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and graphite) using inverse gas chromatography (IGC) technique at an infinite dilution. We have estimated the London dispersive surface energy values of graphite, GO, and rGO as van der Waals interaction to be 156-179, 89-106, and 110-119\u00a0mJ\u00a0m",

        "Title": "Tensile Modulus of Polymer Halloysite Nanotube Systems Containing Filler-Interphase Networks for Biomedical Requests.",
        "Abstract": "To date, there have been a limited number of studies modeling the tensile modulus in the polymer halloysite nanotube (HNT) systems before or after percolation onset. In this paper, an equation for a composite's modulus post-percolation onset was developed for HNT-filled samples including the interphase and HNT network. The dispersed nanoparticles and adjoining interphase part were neglected, because they caused ineffective influences on the stiffness of the system after percolation onset. The developed model reflects the impacts of HNTs' size, interphase depth, percolation onset and the volume shares and moduli of the HNT network and its adjacent interphase on the modulus of HNT-based systems. The impacts of issues on the nanocomposite modulus are defendable, confirming the effectiveness of the developed model. HNT length, interphase depth, HNT concentration, net modulus and net portion directly influenced the stiffness, while the HNT radius and percolation onset had inverse effects. Results show that there was a 142% improvement in the modulus of samples at an interphase depth of 40 nm. Moreover, the stiffness improved by 60% at a net modulus of 200 GPa, but it later exhibited a 180% enhancement at a net modulus of 1000 GPa. In addition, the experimental data for the modulus of numerous composites display fine agreement to the predictions, confirming the validity of the developed model.",

        "Title": "Innovative progress in graphene derivative-based composite hybrid membranes for the removal of contaminants in wastewater: A review.",
        "Abstract": "Graphene derivatives (graphene oxide) are proved as an innovative carbon materials that are getting more attraction in membrane separation technology because of its unique properties and capability to attain layer-to-layer stacking, existence of high oxygen-based functional groups, and generation of nanochannels that successively enhance the selective pollutants removal performance. The review focused on the recent innovations in the development of graphene derivative-based composite hybrid membranes (GDHMs) for the removal of multiple contaminants from wastewater treatment. To design GDHMs, it was observed that at first GO layers undergo chemical treatments with either different polymers, plasma, or sulfonyl. After that, the chemically treated GO layers were decorated with various active functional materials (either with nanoparticles, magnetite, or nanorods, etc.). By preparing GDHMs, properties such as permeability, porosity, hydrophilicity, water flux, stability, feasibility, mechanical strength, regeneration ability, and antifouling tendency were excessively improved as compared to pristine GO membranes. Different types of novel GDHMs were able to remove toxic dyes (77-100%), heavy metals/ions (66-100%), phenols (40-100%), and pharmaceuticals (74-100%) from wastewater with high efficiency. Some of GDHMs were capable to show dual contaminant removal efficacy and antibacterial activity. In this study, it was observed that the most involved mechanisms for pollutants removal are size exclusion, transport, electrostatic interactions, adsorption, and donnan exclusion. In addition to this, interaction mechanism during membrane separation technology has also been elaborated by density functional theory. At last, in this review the discussion related to challenges, limitations, and future outlook for the applications of GDHMs has also been provided.",

        "Abstract": "Electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) are an excellent electrochemical energy storage system (ESS) because of their superior power density, faster charge-discharge ability, and longer cycle life compared to those of other EES systems. Activated carbons (ACs) have been mainly used as the electrode materials for EDLCs because of their high specific surface area, superior chemical stability, and low cost. Petroleum pitch (PP) is a graphitizable carbon that is a promising precursor for ACs because of its high carbon content, which is obtained as an abundant by-product during the distillation of petroleum. However, the processibility of PP is poor because of its stable structure. In this study, pre-oxidized PP-derived AC (OPP-AC) was prepared to investigate the effects of pre-oxidation on the electrochemical behaviors of PP. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of OPP-AC were lower and narrower, respectively, compared to the textural properties of untreated PP-derived AC (PP-AC). On the other hand, the specific capacitance of OPP-AC was 25% higher than that of PP-AC. These results revealed that pre-oxidation of PP induces a highly developed micropore structure of ACs, resulting in improved electrochemical performance.",

        "Abstract": "Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored sperm hyaluronidases (HYAL) assist sperm penetration through the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC), but their role in mammalian fertilization remains unclear. Previously, we demonstrated that sperm from HYAL 5 and 7 double-knockout (dKO) mice produced significantly less offspring than sperm from wild-type mice due to defective COC dispersal. However, the HYAL6 gene remained active in the sperm from the dKO mice, indicating that they were not entirely infertile. This study explored the role of HYAL6 in fertilization by analyzing HYAL6-mutant mice. In this mouse model, HYAL5 and HYAL7 were present in the HYAL6-knockout sperm, and they could disperse hyaluronic acid. We found that HYAL6 was present on the surface of sperm. However, male mice lacking the HYAL6 gene had normal fertility, testicular integrity, and sperm characteristics. Furthermore, in vitro fertilization assays demonstrated that HYAL6-deficient epididymal sperm functioned normally. Therefore, HYAL6 is dispensable for fertilization.",

Here, we summarize the background, research priorities, panel discussions, and deliverables discussed during the symposium across six major domains related to disorders of consciousness. The six domains include (1) Biology of Coma, (2) Coma Database, (3) Neuroprognostication, (4) Care of Comatose Patients, (5) Early Clinical Trials, and (6) Long-term Recovery. Following the 1st Curing Coma NIH virtual symposium held on September 9 to September 10, 2020, six workgroups, each consisting of field experts in respective domains, were formed and tasked with identifying gaps and developing key priorities and deliverables to advance the mission of the Curing Coma Campaign. The highly interactive and inspiring presentations and panel discussions during the 3-day virtual NIH symposium identified several action items for the Curing Coma Campaign mission, which we summarize in this article.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to measure real-time temperature changes in gold-restored teeth compared with intact teeth during the intake of hot and cold drinks. Sixteen molars, including eight natural intact teeth and eight restored teeth with gold inlays, were selected from the participants. Custom-made thermocouple sensors were attached to the coronal third of the buccal surface of teeth. Participants consecutively consumed hot and cold drinks according to a standardized regimen. Resting, maximum, and minimum temperatures; time to reach peak temperatures; and heating and cooling velocities were obtained. Statistical analysis was performed using independent two-sample t-test. Teeth with gold restorations showed a significantly higher maximum temperature (44.7\u00a0\u00b0C [SD 2.9]) than did natural teeth (40.5\u00a0\u00b0C [SD 1.2]) during hot water drinking and showed a lower minimum temperature (25.0\u00a0\u00b0C [SD 4.9]) than did natural teeth (31.5\u00a0\u00b0C [SD 3.1]) during cold water drinking. The heating and cooling rates for the teeth with gold restorations were two and three times higher than those of the natural teeth. Gold-restored teeth showed greater temperature change than intact teeth in terms of magnitude and velocity in response to temperature changes induced by hot and cold drinks.",

        "Abstract": "This study aims to analyze the relationship between cognitive function and out-of-pocket cost of the state change of multiple chronic conditions in individuals aged 60 or older. Data from the 2014 to 2018 Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging were used for 2202 older adults who were cognitively \u201cnormal\u201d at the start of the survey. Four status change groups were established (\u201cGood \u2192 Good,\u201d \u201cGood \u2192 Bad,\u201d \u201cBad \u2192 Good,\u201d and \u201cBad \u2192 Bad\u201d) according to the change in the number of chronic diseases. Generalized estimating equation modeling analyzed the association between these changes and out-of-pocket medical cost. Out-of-pocket cost was significantly higher among older adults with multiple chronic conditions (p < 0.0001). Total out-of-pocket medical cost and out-of-pocket cost for outpatient care and prescription drugs were significantly higher for Bad\u2192 Bad or Good \u2192 Bad changes. Older adults with cognitive decline had significantly higher total out-of-pocket medical cost and out-of-pocket cost for prescription drugs. This study demonstrates the need to improve the multiple chronic conditions management construction model to enhance the health of older adults in Korea and secure national health care finances long-term. It provides a foundation for related medical and medical expenses-related systems.",

        "Abstract": "Dolichoectasia is a form of brain large artery disease associated with a high risk of mortality and morbidity. Progressive enlargement of arterial size is a predictor of mortality, but there are no specific treatments for arresting or slowing down dilatation. Additionally, dilated brain arteries can cause flow stagnation, which can trigger thrombosis and cause stroke. Pathology and genetic studies indicate a possible role for increased matrix metalloproteinase activation in arterial dilatation and thus in the pathophysiology of dolichoectasia. Therefore, therapeutic interventions aimed at slowing down arterial dilatation and preventing thrombosis could hypothetically play a role in treating patients with dolichoectasia.",

        "Abstract": "In this work, novel ZnO/SnS nanocomposites were successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal approach, which is developed for piezoelectric catalytic reduction of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) in an aqueous solution. The constructed ZnO/SnS nanocomposites exhibited higher catalytic efficiency for Cr(VI) reduction under a mechanical force (e.g., ultrasonic vibration) compared to pristine ZnO and SnS. In particular, the ZnO/SnS (with 30 wt.% of SnS) heterojunctions revealed an optimal degradation activity among all the prepared samples, which completely removed the Cr(VI) (20 mg/L) solution within 35 min. Moreover, the piezoelectric catalytic activity of ZnO/SnS remained stable after four consecutive cycling experiments. The results of the morphology observations indicated that the SnS nanoparticles adhere to the surface of the ZnO nanorods. The improved piezoelectric catalytic performance of the ZnO/SnS heterojunctions can be attributed to the formation of an intimate interfacial between ZnO and SnS, which effectively inhibits the electron-hole recombination and speeds up the rate of charge transfer. The study reveals a new design of ZnO/SnS heterojunctions as a high-performance and eco-friendly piezoelectric catalyst and provides a promising strategy for addressing environmental problems and energy crises.",

        "Abstract": "Dystrophinopathy is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which lead to progressive muscle degeneration, necrosis, and finally, death. Recently, golden retrievers have been suggested as a useful animal model for studying human dystrophinopathy, but the model has limitations due to difficulty in maintaining the genetic background using conventional breeding. In this study, we successfully generated a dystrophin mutant dog using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and somatic cell nuclear transfer. The dystrophin mutant dog displayed phenotypes such as elevated serum creatine kinase, dystrophin deficiency, skeletal muscle defects, an abnormal electrocardiogram, and avoidance of ambulation. These results indicate that donor cells with CRISPR/Cas9 for a specific gene combined with the somatic cell nuclear transfer technique can efficiently produce a dystrophin mutant dog, which will help in the successful development of gene therapy drugs for dogs and humans.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory responses in the brain play an etiological role in the development of epilepsy, suggesting that finding novel molecules for controlling neuroinflammation may have clinical value in developing the disease-modifying strategies for epileptogenesis. Adjudin, a multi-functional small molecule compound, has pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory properties. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of adjudin on pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) and its role in the regulation of reactive gliosis and neuroinflammation. SE was induced in male C57BL/6 mice that were then treated with adjudin (50\u00a0mg/kg) for 3 days after SE onset. Immunofluorescence staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining, and western blot analysis were used to evaluate the effects of adjudin treatment in the hippocampus after SE. Our results showed that adjudin treatment significantly mitigated apoptotic cell death in the hippocampus after SE onset. Moreover, adjudin treatment suppressed SE-induced glial activation and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling in the hippocampus. Concomitantly, adjudin treatment significantly reduced SE-induced inflammatory processes, as confirmed by changes in the expression of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, and arginase-1. In conclusion, these findings suggest that adjudin may serve as a potential neuroprotective agent for preventing pathological mechanisms implicated in epileptogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Nemaline myopathies are clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders caused by several different genes. One of them is TNNT1, which was initially described in Amish families and has not been reported in Asian populations. Although most TNNT1 myopathies are caused by loss-of-function mutations, several recent studies have shown that missense mutations can also be pathogenic. A 16-year-old Korean boy with progressive muscle weakness visited the Seoul National University Hospital. He showed generalized myopathy, which was predominant in the paraspinal and neck muscles. Moreover, nemaline rods were observed in a muscle biopsy. Whole-exome sequencing of DNA samples of the patient and his younger brother, who had a similar phenotype, revealed novel compound heterozygous mutations in TNNT1 (c.724G>C (p.Ala242Pro) and c.611+1G>A). Sanger sequencing of cDNA extracted from muscle samples of the patient confirmed partial or total skipping of exon 11 in the splicing variant. The impact of the missense variant on muscle integrity and locomotor activity was verified using a zebrafish loss-of-function model. Here, we reported novel familial cases of TNNT1 myopathy with intermediate clinical presentations caused by compound heterozygous mutations and demonstrated their functional defects using an animal model.",

A new concept advocates an individual cerebral perfusion pressure where cerebral autoregulation functions best to ensure optimal global perfusion. We characterized optimal cerebral perfusion pressure at time of delayed cerebral ischemia and tested the conformity of induced hypertension with this target value.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to realize a highly capacitive/conductive electrode is an essential factor in large-scale devices, requiring a high-power/energy density system. Germanium is a feasible candidate as an anode material of lithium-ion batteries to meet the demands. However, the application is constrained due to low charge conductivity and large volume change on cycles. Here, we design a hybrid conductive shell of multi-component titanium oxide on a germanium microstructure. The shell enables facile hybrid ionic/electronic conductivity for swift charge mobility in the germanium anode, revealed through computational calculation and consecutive measurement of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Furthermore, a well-constructed electrode features a high initial Coulombic efficiency (90.6%) and stable cycle life for 800 cycles (capacity retention of 90.4%) for a fast-charging system. The stress-resilient properties of dense microparticle facilitate to alleviate structural failure toward high volumetric (up to 1737 W h L",

However, uneven Li metal growth and the active surface in nature accelerate electrolyte dissipation and surface corrosion, resulting in poor cycle efficiency and various safety issues. Here, the authors suggest a thin artificial interphase using a multifunctional poly(styrene-b-butadiene-b-styrene) (SBS) copolymer to inhibit the electrochemical/chemical side reaction during cycling. Based on the physical features, hardness, adhesion, and flexibility, the optimized chemical structure of SBS facilitates durable mechanical strength and interphase integrity against repeated Li electrodeposition/dissolution. The effectiveness of the thin polymer film enables high cycle efficiency through the realization of a dendrite-free structure and a chemo-resistive surface of Li metal. The versatile anode demonstrates an improvement in the electrochemical properties, paired with diverse cathodes of high-capacity lithium cobalt oxide (3.5\u00a0mAh cm",

        "Title": "Sperm hyaluronidase is critical to mammals' fertilization for its ability to disperse cumulus-oocyte complex layer.",
        "Abstract": "Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored sperm hyaluronidases have long been believed to assist in sperm penetration through the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC); however, their role in mammalian fertilization remains unclear. Previously, we have shown that hyaluronidase 5 (Hyal5)/Hyal7 double-knockout (dKO) mice produce significantly fewer offspring than their wild-type (WT) counterparts because of defective COC dispersal. Male infertility is mainly caused by a low sperm count. It can be further exacerbated by the deficiency of sperm hyaluronidase, which disperses the cumulus cells of the outer layer of the COC. In the current study, we evaluated the effects of a low count of Hyal-deficient sperm and conditions of ovulated oocytes on the fertilization rate using a mouse model. Our results demonstrated that a low sperm count further decreases the in vitro fertilization (IVF) rate of Hyal-deficient dKO spermatozoa. In addition, the dKO spermatozoa resulted in a fertilization rate of 12.5% upon fertilizing COCs with a thick cumulus layer, whereas the IVF rate was comparable to that of WT spermatozoa when oocytes with a thin or no cumulus layer were fertilized. Finally, we proved that the IVF rate of dKO spermatozoa could be recovered by adding rat spermatozoa as a source of sperm hyal. Our results suggest that a deficiency of proteins involved in fertilization, such as sperm hyal, has a vital role in fertilization.",

        "Abstract": "Radiation-induced cancer risks have known stochastic effects; however, regarding non-cancer diseases, evidence of risk at low radiation doses remains unclear. We aimed to identify underlying characteristics concerning non-cancer disease prevalence and determine associations with radiation dose among Korean radiation workers. Using a nationwide baseline survey, 20,608 workers were enrolled. Data concerning participant demographics, occupational characteristics, lifestyle, and lifetime prevalence of non-cancer diseases were linked to a national dose registry. We compared non-cancer disease prevalences in the Korean general population with those in this cohort and undertook a dose-response analysis concerning the cumulative dose. Hyperlipidemia (10.6%), circulatory (9.6%), and respiratory (4.1%) system diseases, followed by thyroid diseases (3.5%), had the highest prevalences, with hyperlipidemia, thyroid diseases, and hepatitis prevalence being higher in the cohort than in the general population. Radiation doses were associated with elevated prevalences of most diseases; however, associations were attenuated and not significant after adjusting for confounders, except for musculoskeletal system diseases (prevalence odds ratio [POR]/10\u00a0mSv, 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.07) and cataracts (POR/10\u00a0mSv, 1.04; 95% CI 1.00-1.07). Further studies are warranted to investigate the causality of those non-cancer diseases involving more varied confounders such as physical and psychosocial stresses and ultraviolet light.",

        "Abstract": "COVID-19 presentations range from mild to moderate through severe disease but also manifest with persistent illness or viral recrudescence. We hypothesized that the spectrum of COVID-19 disease manifestations was a consequence of SARS-CoV-2-mediated delay in the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) response, including dampened type I interferon signaling, thereby shifting the balance of the immune response to be dominated by damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signaling. To test the hypothesis, we constructed a parsimonious mechanistic mathematical model. After calibration of the model for initial viral load and then by varying a few key parameters, we show that the core model generates four distinct viral load, immune response and associated disease trajectories termed \"patient archetypes\", whose temporal dynamics are reflected in clinical data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The model also accounts for responses to corticosteroid therapy and predicts that vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies and cellular memory will be protective, including from severe COVID-19 disease. This generalizable modeling framework could be used to analyze protective and pathogenic immune responses to diverse viral infections.",

        "Abstract": "Despite its abundance, water is not widely used as a medium for organic reactions. However, under geothermal conditions, water exhibits unique physicochemical properties, such as viscosity and a dielectric constant, and the ionic product become similar to those of common organic solvents. We have synthesized highly crystalline polyimide-based covalent organic frameworks (PICs) under geomimetic hydrothermal conditions. By exploiting triphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexacarboxylic acid in combination with various aromatic diamines, PICs with various pore dimensions and crystallinities were synthesized. XRD, FT-IR, and DFT calculations revealed that the solubility of the oligomeric intermediates under hydrothermal conditions affected the stacking structures of the crystalline PICs. Furthermore, the synthesized PICs demonstrate promising potential as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries owing to its unique redox-active properties and high surface area.",

        "Title": "Estimation of the historical radiation dose of Korean radiation workers, 1961-1983.",
        "Abstract": "Accurate dosimetry plays a key role in evaluating the radiation-induced health risks of radiation workers. The National Dose Registry in Korea contains the dose records of radiation workers in nuclear-related occupations since 1984. Thus, radiation doses for workers before 1984 are often sparse or missing. This study aimed to estimate the historical radiation dose before 1984 for radiation workers in Korea based on dose reconstruction models. The dose reconstruction models were derived from the nationwide self-administered questionnaire survey and the personal badge doses for workers in the cohort of the Korean Radiation Worker Study. The mean estimated annual doses between 1984 and 2016 from the dose reconstruction model were 4.67-0.6 mSv, which closely matched the reported doses of 4.51-0.43 mSv. The mean estimated annual doses between 1961 and 1983 based on the exposure scenarios developed by factors associated with radiation doses ranged from 11.08 to 4.82 mSv. The mean estimated annual doses of individuals in the cohort from 1961 to 1983 ranged from 11.15 to 4.88 mSv. Although caution needs to be exercised in the interpretation of these estimations due to uncertainty owed to the nature of extrapolation beyond the range of observed data, this study offers a sense of the radiation doses for workers during Korea's early period of radiation-related activities, which can be a useful piece of information for radiation-induced health risk assessments.",

        "Title": "\"Scene\" from inside: The representation of Observer's space in high-level visual cortex.",
        "Abstract": "Human observers are remarkably adept at perceiving and interacting with visual stimuli around them. Compared to visual stimuli like objects or faces, scenes are unique in that they provide enclosures for observers. An observer looks at a scene by being physically inside the scene. The current research explored this unique observer-scene relationship by studying the neural representation of scenes' spatial boundaries. Previous studies hypothesized that scenes' boundaries were processed in sets of high-level visual cortices. Notably, the parahippocampal place area (PPA), exhibited neural sensitivity to scenes that had closed vs. open spatial boundaries (Kravitz et al., 2011; Park et al., 2011). We asked whether this sensitivity reflected the openness of landscape (e.g., forest vs. beach), or the openness of the environment immediately surrounding the observer (i.e., whether a scene was viewed from inside vs. outside a room). Across two human fMRI experiments, we found that the PPA, as well as another well-known navigation-processing area, the occipital place area (OPA), processed scenes' boundaries according to the observer's space rather than the landscape. Moreover, we found that the PPA's activation pattern was susceptible to manipulations involving mid-level perceptual properties of scenes (e.g., rectilinear pattern of window frames), while the OPA's response was not. Our results have important implications for research in visual scene processing and suggest an important role of an observer's location in representing the spatial boundary, beyond the low-level visual input of a landscape.",

Moreover, since 2019, the role of PIEZO1 in bone formation has been established, but there have been no PIEZO1-related cases presenting definite skeletal involvement to date. A 21-year-old male with primary lymphatic dysplasia had some other distinctive clinical features, including multiple fracture history during infancy, thoracolumbar scoliosis, short stature, and left-sided facial bone hypoplasia. We analyzed the whole exome of the patient and found two novel pathogenic variants of PIEZO1 in trans: a 93.7\u00a0kb heterozygous deletion (chr16:88,782,477-88,876,207; exon 1-50) and c.2858G>A (p.Arg953His). Sanger sequencing validated the deletion with breakpoints, and each variant was inherited from a different parent. This study presented an extremely rare case of a patient with lymphatic dysplasia caused by compound heterozygous variants of PIEZO1, along with additional clinical manifestations including several skeletal phenotypes.",

        "Abstract": "Cardiovascular disease and cancer have increased the risk of mortality and morbidity in elderly persons worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of sedentary behavior and self-rated health with cardiovascular disease or cancer in elderly people. The data of 6785 elderly persons aged above 65 years from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2014-2018 were examined. Binary logistic regression analyses assessed the association of sedentary behavior, self-rated health, and other risk factors with cardiovascular disease or cancer. Prolonged sedentary behavior in elderly people was associated with a high risk for cardiovascular disease (odds ratio (OR): 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.52). There was a high risk for cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.36, 95% CI: 1.85-3.01) or cancer (OR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.17-1.88) in elderly people who had poor self-rated health. This study identified the association between prolonged sedentary behavior and cardiovascular disease, and between poor self-rated health and cancer. Since prolonged sedentary behavior is related to cardiovascular disease, efforts are needed to reduce sedentary behavior hours and maintain good self-rated health.",

Almost all clinical trials in patients\u00a0with DoC have been limited by small sample sizes, lack of placebo groups, and use of heterogeneous outcome measures. As a result, few therapies have strong evidence to support their use; amantadine is the only therapy recommended by current clinical guidelines, specifically for patients with DoC caused by severe traumatic brain injury. To foster and advance development of consciousness-promoting therapies for patients with DoC, the Curing Coma Campaign convened a Coma Science Work Group to perform a gap analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Chitosan (CS), the only alkaline polysaccharose available in nature, has always been a promising candidate for drug delivery owing to its excellent biodegradability and biocompatibility. However, inherent solubility and polycationic properties of CS largely hinder electrospinning, which is an efficient method of fabricating nanofibers for drug carriers. To solve this problem and extend the applications of CS, polyamide/chitosan/tetraethyl orthosilicate (PA/CS/TEOS) composite nanofibers were successfully prepared as drug carriers in this study via electrospinning. The PA/CS/TEOS ratios significantly influenced the nanofiber morphology. As the content of each was increased, the beads among the membranes increased initially and then decreased, determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The morphology of the optimum membranes with the ratio of 1:0.13:0.67 was smoother with less beads and uniform fiber diameter. Finally, the membranes with optimum ratios were used as carriers of ofloxacin in the study of drug release performance to identify their future feasibility, which revealed an initial fast release followed by a relatively stable release.",

Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) used as nano-scale fillers are treated with atmospheric-pressure plasma to introduce oxygen functional groups on the fillers' surface to increase the surface free energy and polar component, which relates to the mechanical properties of multi-scale composites. In addition, the effect of dispersibility was analyzed through the fracture surfaces of multi-scale composites containing atmospheric-pressure plasma-treated SWCNTs (P-SWCNTs) under high load conditions. The fillers content has an optimum weight percent load at 0.5 wt.% and the fracture toughness (",

        "Title": "Enhanced Bioavailability and Efficacy of Silymarin Solid Dispersion in Rats with Acetaminophen-Induced Hepatotoxicity.",
        "Abstract": "We evaluated the bioavailability, liver distribution, and efficacy of silymarin-D-\u03b1-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) solid dispersion (silymarin-SD) in rats with acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity (APAP) compared with silymarin alone. The solubility of silybin, the major and active component of silymarin, in the silymarin-SD group increased 23-fold compared with the silymarin group. The absorptive permeability of silybin increased by 4.6-fold and its efflux ratio decreased from 5.5 to 0.6 in the presence of TPGS. The results suggested that TPGS functioned as a solubilizing agent and permeation enhancer by inhibiting efflux pump. Thus, silybin concentrations in plasma and liver were increased in the silymarin-SD group and liver distribution increased 3.4-fold after repeated oral administration of silymarin-SD (20 mg/kg as silybin) for five consecutive days compared with that of silymarin alone (20 mg/kg as silybin). Based on higher liver silybin concentrations in the silymarin-SD group, the therapeutic effects of silymarin-SD in hepatotoxic rats were evaluated and compared with silymarin administration only. Elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly decreased by silymarin-SD, silymarin, and TPGS treatments, but these decreases were much higher in silymarin-SD animals than in those treated with silymarin or TPGS. In conclusion, silymarin-SD (20 mg/kg as silybin, three times per day for 5 days) exhibited hepatoprotective properties toward hepatotoxic rats and these properties were superior to silymarin alone, which may be attributed to increased solubility, enhanced intestinal permeability, and increased liver distribution of the silymarin-SD formulation.",

Electrochemical properties were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and structural analysis was done by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). As a result, higher electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and methanol oxidation reactions were obtained, and the electrochemical properties of Pt-c(NH\u2082-MIL-101)@NCNT are better than pristine Pt-c(NH\u2082-MIL-101). The enhanced activity related with the synergy effect from the higher conductivity of N-doped CNT and the better porous nanostructure of carbonized NH\u2082-MIL-101(Fe).",

        "Title": "Concavity as a diagnostic feature of visual scenes.",
        "Abstract": "Despite over two decades of research on the neural mechanisms underlying human visual scene, or place, processing, it remains unknown what exactly a \"scene\" is. Intuitively, we are always inside a scene, while interacting with the outside of objects. Hence, we hypothesize that one diagnostic feature of a scene may be concavity, portraying \"inside\", and predict that if concavity is a scene-diagnostic feature, then: 1) images that depict concavity, even non-scene images (e.g., the \"inside\" of an object - or concave object), will be behaviorally categorized as scenes more often than those that depict convexity, and 2) the cortical scene-processing system will respond more to concave images than to convex images. As predicted, participants categorized concave objects as scenes more often than convex objects, and, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), two scene-selective cortical regions (the parahippocampal place area, PPA, and the occipital place area, OPA) responded significantly more to concave than convex objects. Surprisingly, we found no behavioral or neural differences between images of concave versus convex buildings. However, in a follow-up experiment, using tightly-controlled images, we unmasked a selective sensitivity to concavity over convexity of scene boundaries (i.e., walls) in PPA and OPA. Furthermore, we found that even highly impoverished line drawings of concave shapes are behaviorally categorized as scenes more often than convex shapes. Together, these results provide converging behavioral and neural evidence that concavity is a diagnostic feature of visual scenes.",

        "Title": "Impacts of ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions on platelet recovery and outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage.",
        "Abstract": "Acute platelet transfusion after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) given in efforts to reverse antiplatelet medication effects and prevent ongoing bleeding does not appear to improve outcome and may be associated with harm. Although the underlying mechanisms are unclear, the influence of ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions on ICH outcomes has not been investigated. We hypothesized that patients with ICH who receive ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions would have worse platelet recovery (using absolute count increment [ACI]) and neurological outcomes (mortality and poor modified Rankin Scale [mRS 4-6]) than those receiving ABO-compatible transfusions. In a single-center cohort of consecutively admitted patients with ICH, we identified 125 patients receiving acute platelet transfusions, of whom 47 (38%) received an ABO-incompatible transfusion. Using quantile regression, we identified an association of ABO-incompatible platelet transfusion with lower platelet recovery (ACI, 2 \u00d7 103cells per \u03bcL vs 15 \u00d7 103cells per \u03bcL; adjusted coefficient \u03b2, -19; 95% confidence interval [CI], -35.55 to -4.44; P = .01). ABO-incompatible platelet transfusion was also associated with increased odds of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.59; 95% CI, 1.00-6.73; P = .05) and poor mRS (adjusted OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 0.97-13.42; P = .06); however, these estimates were imprecise. Together, these findings suggest the importance of ABO compatibility for platelet transfusions for ICH, but further investigation into the mechanism(s) underlying these observations is required.",

However, there is a lack of evidence on the association between thyroid screening and increased thyroid cancer incidence in most occupational studies. In this study, we compared thyroid cancer screening rates between the general population and radiation workers with various occupations and examined the relationship between these rates and thyroid cancer incidence. We compared thyroid screening rates between radiation workers and the general population with age- and sex-standardized screening ratios (SSRs) using data from two national surveys conducted during 2015-2017 in Korea, and assessed the correlation between these ratios and age- and sex-standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for thyroid cancer. Screening rates were higher among radiation workers than among the general population, with an overall SSR of 1.58 (95% confidence interval: 1.54-1.62). When various types of occupations were compared, those with an increased SSR also had an increased SIR. SSRs remained high even when the screening period was restricted to the year preceding the survey (the year after the establishment of guidelines for thyroid cancer screening aimed at reducing overdiagnosis). In conclusion, the increased incidence of thyroid cancer among radiation workers compared to that among the general population can be attributed mainly to increased thyroid screening rates. Additional efforts are needed to reduce unnecessary thyroid cancer screening in occupational populations, particularly in those with better access to healthcare, in terms of clinical rationale and for assessing the true increase in thyroid cancer incidence.",

        "Abstract": "Following the pioneering efforts of a federal Head Start program, U.S. state policymakers have rapidly expanded access to Early Care and Education (ECE) programs with strong bipartisan support. Within the past decade the enrollment of 4 year-olds has roughly doubled in state-funded preschool. Despite these public investments, the content and priorities of early childhood legislation-enacted and failed-have rarely been examined. This study integrates perspectives from public policy, political science, developmental science, and machine learning in examining state ECE bills in identifying key factors associated with legislative success. Drawing from the Early Care and Education Bill Tracking Database, we employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a statistical topic identification model, to examine 2,396 ECE bills across the 50 U.S. states during the 2015-2018. First, a six-topic solution demonstrated the strongest fit theoretically and empirically suggesting two meta policy priorities: 'ECE finance' and 'ECE services'. 'ECE finance' comprised three dimensions: (1) Revenues, (2) Expenditures, and (3) Fiscal Governance. 'ECE services' also included three dimensions: (1) PreK, (2) Child Care, and (3) Health and Human Services (HHS). Further, we found that bills covering a higher proportion of HHS, Fiscal Governance, or Expenditures were more likely to pass into law relative to bills focusing largely on PreK, Child Care, and Revenues. Additionally, legislative effectiveness of the bill's primary sponsor was a strong predictor of legislative success, and further moderated the relation between bill content and passage. Highly effective legislators who had previously passed five or more bills had an extremely high probability of introducing a legislation that successfully passed regardless of topic. Legislation with expenditures as policy priorities benefitted the most from having an effective legislator. We conclude with a discussion of the empirical findings within the broader context of early childhood policy literature and suggest implications for future research and policy.",

Intravenously injected rosmarinic acid showed bi-exponential decay and unchanged rosmarinic acid was mainly eliminated by urinary excretion, suggesting the involvement of transporters in its renal excretion. Rosmarinic acid showed organic anion transporter (OAT)1-mediated active transport with a K",

        "Abstract": "Refractory intracranial hypertension (RIH) is a dramatic increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) that cannot be controlled by treatment. Recent reports suggest that the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity may be altered during changes in ICP. Our study aimed to assess ANS activity during RIH and the causal relationship between rising in ICP and autonomic activity. We reviewed retrospectively 24 multicenter (Cambridge, Tromso, Berlin) patients in whom RIH developed as a pre-terminal event after acute brain injury (ABI). They were monitored with ICP, arterial blood pressure (ABP), and electrocardiography (ECG) using ICM+ software. Parameters reflecting autonomic activity were computed in time and frequency domain through the measurement of heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). Our results demonstrated that a rise in ICP was associated to a significant rise in HRV and BRS with a higher significance level in the high-frequency HRV (",

Tilianin has a wide variety of pharmacological properties such as cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and anti-atherogenic activities. We recently discovered that tilianin has the ability to suppress MUC5AC expression in vitro. In addition, we have established an in vivo model of allergic asthma using house dust mite (HDM) that can be applied to tilianin.",

        "Abstract": "Stable battery operation involving high-capacity electrode materials such as tin (Sn) has been plagued by dimensional instability-driven battery degradation despite the potentially accessible high energy density of batteries. Rational design of Sn-based electrodes inevitably requires buffering or passivation layers mostly in a multi-stacked manner with sufficient void inside the shells. However, undesirable void engineering incurs energy loss and shell fracture during the strong calendaring process. Here, this study reports an inverse design of freestanding 3D graphene electrodes sequentially passivated by capacity-contributing Sn and protective/buffering TiO",

        "Title": "Energy-Efficient Tunneling Field-Effect Transistors for Low-Power Device Applications: Challenges and Opportunities.",
        "Abstract": "Conventional field-effect transistors (FETs) have long been considered a fundamental electronic component for a diverse range of devices. However, nanoelectronic circuits based on FETs are not energy efficient because they require a large supply voltage for switching applications. To reduce the supply voltage in standard FETs, which is hampered by the 60 mV/decade limit established by the subthreshold swing (SS), a new class of FETs have been designed, tunnel FETs (TFETs). A TFET utilizes charge-carrier transportation in device channels using quantum mechanical based band-to-band tunneling despite of conventional thermal injection. The TFETs fabricated with thin semiconducting film or nanowires can attain a 100-fold power drop compared to complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors. As a result, the use of TFETs and CMOS technology together could ameliorate integrated circuits for low-power devices. The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) materials with a diverse range of electronic properties has also opened new gateways for condensed matter physics, nanotechnology, and material science, thus potentially improving TFET-based devices in terms of device design and performance. In this review, state-of-art TFET devices exhibiting different semiconducting channels and geometries are comprehensively reviewed followed by a brief discussion of the challenges that remain for the development of high-performance devices. Lastly, future prospects are presented for the improvement of device design and the working efficiency of TFETs.",

We performed small RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of maternal serum extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) to discover and verify microRNAs (miRNAs) differentially expressed in patients who later developed pre-eclampsia. Sera collected from 73 pre-eclampsia cases and 139 controls between 17 and 28 weeks gestational age (GA), divided into separate discovery and verification cohorts, are analyzed by small RNA-seq. Discovery and verification of univariate and bivariate miRNA biomarkers reveal that bivariate biomarkers verify at a markedly higher rate than univariate biomarkers. The majority of verified biomarkers contain miR-155-5p, which has been reported to mediate the pre-eclampsia-associated repression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). Deconvolution analysis reveals that several verified miRNA biomarkers come from the placenta and are likely carried by placenta-specific extracellular vesicles.",

        "Abstract": "Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is a highly attenuated poxvirus vector that is widely used to develop vaccines for infectious diseases and cancer. We developed a novel vaccine platform based on a unique three-plasmid system to efficiently generate recombinant MVA vectors from chemically synthesized DNA. In response to the ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), we used this novel vaccine platform to rapidly produce fully synthetic MVA (sMVA) vectors co-expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid antigens, two immunodominant antigens implicated in protective immunity. Mice immunized with these sMVA vectors developed robust SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, including potent neutralizing antibodies. These results demonstrate the potential of a novel vaccine platform based on synthetic DNA to efficiently generate recombinant MVA vectors and to rapidly develop a multi-antigenic poxvirus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate.",

We developed a novel vaccine platform based on a unique three-plasmid system to efficiently generate recombinant MVA vectors from chemically synthesized DNA. In response to the ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), we used this novel vaccine platform to rapidly produce fully synthetic MVA (sMVA) vectors co-expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid antigens, two immunodominant antigens implicated in protective immunity. Mice immunized with these sMVA vectors developed robust SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, including potent neutralizing antibodies. These results demonstrate the potential of a novel vaccine platform based on synthetic DNA to efficiently generate recombinant MVA vectors and to rapidly develop a multi-antigenic poxvirus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate.",

        "Abstract": "Fossil fuels are a main source of energy but also the major contributor to global warming. Therefore, the needs for alternative renewable and sustainable energy sources such as natural gas is increasing; nevertheless, for practical use, efficient gas storage materials of alternative fuels are essential. Activated carbons (ACs) are a promising candidate as gas storage materials due to their narrow micropore size distribution and high porosity. Appropriate selection of the activating reagents is key factor for the preparation of high-performance ACs. Recently, potassium hydroxide is the most widely used activating reagent, but its application for plant-scale production is reluctant by its toxicity and high corrosiveness. Hence, in this study, the less corrosive and easy manageable potassium oxalate salt was used as an alternative reagent to prepare ACs from corn starch, for methane storage. The products were characterized based on their N\u2082 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K and on their specific surface area and pore size distributions, respectively calculated via the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation and the non-local density functional (NLDFT) theory. The methane storage capacities and adsorption cycles were investigated with a high-pressure adsorption instrument operating at 298 K and 35 bar.",

        "Abstract": "Multiscale hierarchy is a promising chemical approach that provides superior performance in syner-gistically integrated microstructured fibers and nanostructured materials in composite applications. The main purpose of this work was to introduce graphene oxide (GO) between an epoxy matrix and basalt fibers to improve mechanical properties by enhancing interfacial adhesion. The composites were reinforced with various concentrations of GO. For all of the fabricated composites, the optimum GO content was found to be 0.5 wt%, which improved the interlaminar shear strength and fracture toughness by 66.2% and 86.1%, respectively, compared with those of neat composites. We observed a direct linear relationship between fracture toughness and certain surface free energy. In addition, the fracture toughness mechanisms were illustrated using a crack theory based on morphology analyses of fracture surfaces. Such an effort could accelerate the conversion of multi-scale composites into high-performance materials and provide rational guidance and fundamental understanding toward realizing the theoretical limits of mechanical properties.",

A homogeneous dispersion of Ag/TiO\u2082 nanoparticles was shown on the surface of GO. Increasing the nitrogen doping concentration increased hydrophilicity, thereby improving the conductivity of Ag/TiO\u2082/GO nanocomposites.",

        "Abstract": "Coma and disordered consciousness are common manifestations of acute neurological conditions and are among the most pervasive and challenging aspects of treatment in neurocritical care. Gaps exist in patient assessment, outcome prognostication, and treatment directed specifically at improving consciousness and cognitive recovery. In 2019, the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS)\u00a0launched the Curing Coma Campaign in order to address the \"grand challenge\" of improving the management of patients with coma and decreased consciousness. One of the first steps was to bring together a Scientific Advisory Council including coma scientists, neurointensivists, neurorehabilitationists, and implementation experts in order to address the current scientific landscape and begin to develop a framework on how to move forward. This manuscript describes the proceedings of the first Curing Coma Campaign Scientific Advisory Council meeting which occurred in conjunction with the NCS Annual Meeting in October 2019 in Vancouver. Specifically, three major pillars were identified which should be considered: endotyping of coma and disorders of consciousness, biomarkers, and proof-of-concept clinical trials. Each is summarized with regard to current approach, benefits to the patient, family, and clinicians, and next steps. Integration of these three pillars will be essential to the success of the Curing Coma Campaign as will expanding the \"curing coma community\" to ensure broad participation of clinicians, scientists, and patient advocates with the goal of identifying and implementing treatments to fundamentally improve the outcome of patients.",

        "Abstract": "As the world population continues to increase to unsustainable levels, the importance of birth control and the development of new contraceptives are emerging. To date, male contraceptive options have been lagging behind those available to women, and those few options available are not satisfactory to everyone. To solve this problem, we have been searching for new candidate target proteins for non-hormonal contraceptives. Testis-specific proteins are appealing targets for male contraceptives because they are more likely to be involved in male reproduction and their targeting by small molecules is predicted to have no on-target harmful effects on other organs. Using in silico analysis, we identified Erich2, Glt6d1, Prss58, Slfnl1, Sppl2c, Stpg3, Tex33, and Tex36 as testis-abundant genes in both mouse and human. The genes, 4930402F06Rik and 4930568D16Rik, are testis-abundant paralogs of Glt6d1 that we also discovered in mice but not in human, and were also included in our studies to eliminate the potential compensation. We generated knockout (KO) mouse lines of all listed genes using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Analysis of all of the individual KO mouse lines as well as Glt6d1/4930402F06Rik/4930568D16Rik TKO mouse lines revealed that they are male fertile with no observable defects in reproductive organs, suggesting that these 10 genes are not required for male fertility nor play redundant roles in the case of the 3 Glt6D1 paralogs. Further studies are needed to uncover protein function(s), but in vivo functional screening using the CRISPR/Cas9 system is a fast and accurate way to find genes essential for male fertility, which may apply to studies of genes expressed elsewhere. In this study, although we could not find any potential protein targets for non-hormonal male contraceptives, our findings help to streamline efforts to find and focus on only the essential genes.",

        "Abstract": "High dose intake of docosahexaenoic acid showed beneficial effects on atopic dermatitis in patients and was found to increase regulatory T cells in mice, but its molecular target has not been identified. Free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFA4, also known as GPR120) is a receptor sensing polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids including docosahexaenoic acid. In the present study, we examined whether FFA4 acted as a therapeutic target of docosahexaenoic acid for treating atopic dermatitis. Experimental atopic dermatitis was induced in mice by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) sensitization on day 0, followed by repeated DNCB challenges from D7 to D48. The mice were treated with a selective agonist compound A (30\u2009mg\u00b7\u2009kg",

        "Abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency with high mortality and a risk factor for the development of chronic epilepsy. Given that effective treatments for the pathophysiology following SE are still lacking, suppressing pathophysiological mechanisms of SE may be important to inhibit epileptogenesis. Withanolide-A (WA), a major bioactive component of Withania somnifera, is a potential medicinal natural compound showing improvement of some neurological diseases, such as cerebral ischemia. In the present study, we examined whether administration of WA can exert the beneficial effects involved in neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory effects in a mouse model of pilocarpine-induced SE. Our results showed that WA treatment ameliorated SE-induced apoptotic neuronal cell death in the hippocampus. Moreover, WA treatment reduced immunoreactivity of both ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1-positive microglia/macrophage and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive reactive astrocytes, and the SE-induced increase in both interleukin-1 \u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor in the hippocampus, suggesting that inhibiting pro-inflammatory factors by WA treatment might induce neuroprotection after SE. These results suggest that WA may be useful in improving the treatment efficacy for pathophysiology following SE.",

        "Title": "A Three-Dimensional Nano-web Scaffold of Ferroelectric Beta-PVDF Fibers for Lithium Metal Plating and Stripping.",
        "Abstract": "Lithium metal has been considered as an anode material to improve energy densities of lithium chemistry-based rechargeable batteries (that is to say, lithium metal batteries or LMBs). Higher capacities and cell voltages are ensured by replacing practically used anode materials such as graphite with lithium metal. However, lithium metal as the LMB anode material has been challenged by its dendritic growth, electrolyte decomposition on its fresh surface, and its serious volumetric change. To address the problems of lithium metal anodes, herein, we guided and facilitated lithium ion transport along a spontaneously polarized and highly dielectric material. A three-dimensional web of nanodiameter fibers of ferroelectric beta-phase polyvinylidene fluoride (beta-PVDF) was loaded on a copper foil by electrospinning (PVDF#Cu). The electric field applied between the nozzle and target copper foil forced the dipoles of PVDF to be oriented centro-asymmetrically and then the beta structure induced ferroelectric polarization. Three-fold benefits of the ferroelectric nano-web architecture guaranteed the plating/stripping reversibility especially at high rates: (1) three-dimensional scaffold to accommodate the volume change of lithium metal during plating and stripping, (2) electrolyte channels between fibers to allow lithium ions to move, and (3) ferroelectrically polarized or negatively charged surface of beta-PVDF fibers to encourage lithium ion hopping along the surface. Resultantly, the beta-PVDF web architecture drove dense and integrated growth of lithium metal within its structure. The kinetic benefit expected from the ferroelectric lithium ion transport of beta-PVDF as well as the porous architecture of PVDF#Cu was realized in a cell of LFP as a cathode and lithium-plated PVDF#Cu as an anode. Excellent plating/stripping reversibility along repeated cycles was successfully demonstrated in the cell even at a high current such as 2.3 mA cm",

However, the low fluorescence yield and monochromatic fluorescence of CQDs limit their practical applications. This review summarizes the commonly used approaches for improving the fluorescence efficiency of CQDs doped with non-metallic (heteroatom) elements. Herein, three types of heteroatom-doped CQDs have been investigated: (1) CQDs doped with a single heteroatom; (2) CQDs doped with two heteroatoms; and (3) CQDs doped with three heteroatoms. The limitations and future perspectives of doped CQDs from the viewpoint of producing CQDs for specific applications, especially for bioimaging and light emitting diodes, have also been discussed herein.",

        "Abstract": "The Korean Radiation Worker Study investigated the health effects of protracted low-dose radiation among nuclear-related occupations in the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission in Korea. From 2016-2017, 20,608 workers were enrolled (86.5% men and 30.7% nuclear power plant workers). The mean cumulative dose \u00b1 standard deviation between 1984 and 2017 (1st quarter) was 11.8 \u00b1 28.8 (range 0-417) mSv. Doses below recording level (\u22640.1 mSv) were reported in 7901 (38.3%) cases; 431 (2%) had cumulative doses \u2265100 mSv. From 1999-2016, 212 cancers (189 men, 23 women) occurred; thyroid cancer predominated (39.2%, 72 men, 11 women). In men, the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for all cancers was significantly decreased (SIR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.66-0.88); however, that for thyroid cancer was significantly increased (SIR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.54-2.44). Compared to the non-exposed group (\u22640.1 mSv), the relative risk (RR) in the exposed group (>0.1 mSv) after adjusting for sex, attained age, smoking status, and duration of employment was 0.82 (95% CI 0.60-1.12) for all cancers and 0.83 (95% CI 0.49-1.83) for thyroid cancer. The preliminary findings from this baseline study with a shorter follow-up than the latency period for solid cancer cannot exclude possible associations between radiation doses and cancer risk.",

        "Abstract": "For visually guided navigation, the use of environmental cues is essential. Particularly, detecting local boundaries that impose limits to locomotion and estimating their location is crucial. In a series of three fMRI experiments, we investigated whether there is a neural coding of navigational distance in the human visual cortex (both female and male). We used virtual reality software to systematically manipulate the distance from a viewer perspective to different types of a boundary. Using a multivoxel pattern classification employing a linear support vector machine, we found that the occipital place area (OPA) is sensitive to the navigational distance restricted by the transparent glass wall. Further, the OPA was sensitive to a non-crossable boundary only, suggesting an importance of the functional constraint of a boundary. Together, we propose the OPA as a perceptual source of external environmental features relevant for navigation.",

        "Abstract": "Nanoparticles (NPs) have various applications in medicine, cosmetics, optics, catalysis, environmental purification, and other areas nowadays. With an increasing annual production of NPs, the risks of their harmful influence to the environment and human health is rising. Currently, our knowledge about the mechanisms of interaction between NPs and living organisms is limited. Additionally, poor understanding of how physical and chemical characteristic and different conditions influence the toxicity of NPs restrict our attempts to develop the standards and regulations which might allow us to maintain safe living conditions. The marine species and their habitat environment are under continuous stress due to anthropogenic activities which result in the appearance of NPs in the aquatic environment. Our study aimed to evaluate and compare biochemical effects caused by the influence of different types of carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, and silica nanotubes on four marine microalgae species. We evaluated the changes in growth-rate, esterase activity, membrane polarization, and size changes of microalgae cells using flow cytometry method. Our results demonstrated that toxic effects caused by the carbon nanotubes strongly correlated with the content of heavy metal impurities in the NPs. More hydrophobic carbon NPs with less ordered structure had a higher impact on the red microalgae ",

        "Abstract": "We studied that hybrid material of two metal component organic framework (Bimetal MOF), containing graphene oxide (GO) as a sulfur immobilizing host was successfully synthesized by hydrothermal reaction. To prove effect of MOF, only GO and ZIF-67 (Zeolitic imidazolate framework) composites were prepared as comparative samples. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy (FT-IR) were conducted to determine the morphology and micro-structure of the composite. Electrochemical properties were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests were performed by battery tester. Based on these electrochemical experiments, Bimetal-MOF composites showed the better performance than the other samples.",

        "Abstract": "This study identified occupational factors associated with radiation exposure in Korea. Survey data of 16\u00a0037 workers from 2016 to 2017, including lifestyle factors and occupational characteristics, were combined with the National Dose Registry. Higher average annual doses were observed in groups exhibiting health risk factors such as body mass index (BMI) and smoking. Average annual doses also differed according to occupational characteristics, including average daily working hours, use of radiation protection gear, calendar year of hiring and employment status. Moreover, the influence of different factors on radiation dose differed with occupations. In industrial radiography and nuclear power plants, average daily working hours were the most important factor determining worker radiation doses. In other occupations, such as education, industry and research, calendar year of hiring and duration of employment were the most important factors. This research indicates the need to consider the specific work procedures of occupations to determine exposure variations between or within facilities.",

        "Abstract": "A substantial portion of Mendelian disease patients suffers from genetic variants that are inherited in a recessive manner. A precise understanding of pathogenic recessive variants in a population would assist in pre-screening births of such patients. However, a systematic understanding of the contribution of recessive variants to Mendelian diseases is still lacking. Therefore, genetic diagnosis and variant discovery of 553 undiagnosed Korean patients with complex neurodevelopmental problems (KND for Korean NeuroDevelopmental cohort) were performed using whole exome sequencing of patients and their parents. Disease-causing variants, including newly discovered variants, were identified in 57.5% of the probands of the KND cohort. Among the patients with the previous reported pathogenic variants, 35.1% inherited these variants in a recessive manner. Genes that cause recessive disorders in our cohort tend to be less constrained by loss-of-function variants and were enriched in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial functions. This observation was applied to an estimation that approximately 1 in 17 healthy Korean individuals carry at least one of these pathogenic variants that develop severe neurodevelopmental problems in a recessive manner. Furthermore, the feasibility of these genes for carrier screening was evaluated. Our results will serve as a foundation for recessive variant screening to reduce occurrences of rare Mendelian disease patients. Additionally, our results highlight the utility and necessity of whole exome sequencing-based diagnostics for improving patient care in a country with a centralized medical system.",

        "Abstract": "Design of freestanding electrodes incorporated with redox-active organic materials has been limited by the poor intrinsic electrical conductivity and lack of methodology driving the feasible integration of conductive substrate and the organic molecules. Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) aerogels, which possess continuous network structure and high surface area, offer a three-dimensional electrically conducting scaffold. Here, we fabricate monolithic organic electrodes by coating a nanometer-scale imide-based network (IBN) that possesses abundant redox-active sites on the 3D SWCNT scaffold. The substantially integrated 3D monolithic organic electrodes sustain high electrical conductance through a 3D electronic pathway in their compressed form (\u223c21 \u03bcm). A thin and controllable layer (<8 nm) of IBN organic materials has a strong adhesion onto the ultra-lightweight and conductive substrate and facilitates multielectron redox reactions to deliver a specific capacity of up to 1550 mA h g",

        "Title": "Impaired behavioral and neural representation of scenes in Williams syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "Boundaries are crucial to our representation of the geometric shape of scenes, which can be used to reorient in space. Behavioral research has shown that children and adults share exquisite sensitivity to a defining feature of a boundary: its vertical extent. Imaging studies have shown that this boundary property is represented in the parahippocampal place area (PPA) among typically developed (TD) adults. Here, we show that sensitivity to the vertical extent of scene boundaries is impaired at both the behavioral and neural level in people with Williams syndrome (WS), a genetic deficit that results in severely impaired spatial functions. Behavioral reorientation was tested in three boundary conditions: a flat Mat, a 5\u00a0cm high Curb, and full Walls. Adults with WS could reorient in a rectangular space defined by Wall boundaries, but not Curb or Mat boundaries. In contrast, TD age-matched controls could reorient by all three boundary types and TD 4-year-olds could reorient by either Wall or Curb boundaries. Using fMRI, we find that the WS behavioral deficit is echoed in their neural representation of boundaries. While TD age-matched controls showed distinct neural responses to scenes depicting Mat, Curb, and Wall boundaries in the PPA, people with WS showed only a distinction between the Wall and Mat or Curb, but no distinction between the Mat and Curb. Taken together, these results reveal a close coupling between the representation of boundaries as they are used in behavioral reorientation and neural encoding, suggesting that damage to this key element of spatial representation may have a genetic foundation.",

        "Abstract": "We obtained nickel metal organic framework/reduced graphene oxide (Ni-MOF/rGO) composites in the presence of graphene oxide solution using hydrothermal method. The electrochemical performance of the composite was measured by voltammetry and charge-discharge tests. As a result of morphological and structural analysis, Ni-MOF/rGO composite was found to be a composite of cubic structure with good crystallinity and large specific surface area. The Ni-MOF/rGO composite used as the electrode material of the supercapacitor exhibited a high specific capacitance (1154.4 F/g) of 1 A/g in the 6 M KOH and 53.4% at the current density range of 0.66 to 3 A/g. A retention of capacitance of 90% after 3000 cycles was confirmed. This means that Ni-MOF/rGO composites are proper electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage systems.",

        "Title": "A Cloud-based Middleware for Self-Adaptive IoT-Collaboration Services.",
        "Abstract": "The middleware framework for IoT collaboration services should provide efficient solutions to context awareness and uncertainty issues among multiple collaboration domains. However, existing middleware frameworks are mostly limited to a single system, and developing self-adaptive IoT collaboration services using existing frameworks requires developers to take considerable time and effort. Furthermore, the developed IoT collaboration services are often dependent on a particular domain, which cannot easily be referenced in other domains. This paper proposes a cloud-based middleware framework that provides a set of cloud services for self-adaptive IoT collaboration services. The proposed middleware framework is generic in the sense that it clearly separates domain-dependent components from the layers that leverage existing middleware frameworks. In addition, the proposed framework allows developers to upload domain-dependent components onto the cloud, search for registered components, and launch Virtual Machine (VM) running a new MAPE cycle via a convenient web-based interface. The feasibility of the proposed framework has been shown with a simulation of an IoT collaboration service that traces a criminal suspect. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed middleware framework runs with an overhead of only 6% compared to pure Java-based middleware and is scalable as the number of VMs increases up to 16.",

        "Abstract": "Although the volume of antimony tremendously expands during the alloying reaction with sodium, it is considered a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Repeated volume changes along the sodiation/desodiation cycles encourage capacity fading by triggering pulverization accompanying electrolyte decomposition. Additionally, the low cation transference number of sodium ions is another hindrance for application in SIBs. In this work, a binder was designed for the antimony in SIB cells to ensure bifunctionality and improve (1) the mechanical toughness to suppress the serious volume change and (2) the transference number of sodium ions. A cross-linked composite of poly(acrylic acid) and cyanoethyl pullulan (pullulan-CN) was presented as the binder. The polysaccharide backbone of pullulan-CN was responsible for the mechanical toughness, while the cyanoethyl groups of pullulan-CN improved the lithium-cation transfer. The antimony-based SIB cells using the composite binder showed improved cycle life with enhanced kinetics. The capacity was maintained at 76% of the initial value at the 200",

        "Abstract": "In this study, the hydrolytic degradation of poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) blend and PLA/PEO/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) nanobiosensors in neutral phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution was investigated by experimental and theoretical approaches. A simple model was developed to estimate the degradation fraction by applying the average degradation rate (K) and time exponent. The predictions of the developed model were compared to the experimental results. Moreover, CNT concentration, CNT size, sample thickness, diffusion coefficient, and concentration of the PEO phase influenced the K value. The impacts of the parameters on the degradation rate were studied to confirm the developed equation. All samples were rapidly degraded during the first week, while the degradation slowly progressed in the following weeks. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that CNTs quicken the degradation of samples. The degradation fraction of a nanobiosensor depends directly on the values of K and the time exponent. Furthermore, a high concentration of PEO, small thickness of the sample, high concentration of thin CNTs, and high diffusion coefficient desirably improve the degradation rate.",

In this study, we present stretchable conductors made from multiple layers of gradient assembled polyurethane (GAP) comprising gold nanoparticles capable of self-assembly under strain. Stratified layering affords control over the composite internal architecture at multiple scales, leading to metallic conductivity in both the lateral and transversal directions under strains of as high as 300%. The unique combination of the electrical and mechanical properties of GAP electrodes enables the development of a stretchable lithium-ion battery with a charge-discharge rate capability of 100 mAh g",

We investigated the immunogenicity and cross protective efficacy of virus-like particle containing neuraminidase derived from 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (N1 VLP) in comparison with inactivated split influenza vaccine. Immunization of mice with N1 VLP induced antibody responses specific for virus and cross-reactive neuraminidase inhibition activity whereas an inactivated split vaccine induced strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition activity. N1 VLP-immunized mice developed cross protective immunity against antigenically different influenza viruses, as determined by body weight changes, lung viral titers, infiltrating innate immune cells, and cytokines, and antibody secreting cells, and germinal center B cells. Also, N1 VLP-immune sera provided cross-protection in na\u00efve mice. Immunity by N1 VLP vaccination was not compromised in Fc receptor \u03b3-chain deficient mice. These results suggest that neuraminidase-presenting VLP can be developed as an effective cross-protective vaccine candidate along with current influenza vaccination.",

        "Abstract": "Electrospinning has emerged as one of the potential techniques for producing nanofibers. The use of electrospun nanofibers in drug delivery has increased rapidly over recent years due to their valuable properties, which include a large surface area, high porosity, small pore size, superior mechanical properties, and ease of surface modification. A drug loaded nanofiber membrane can be prepared via electrospinning using a model drug and polymer solution; however, the release of the drug from the nanofiber membrane in a safe and controlled way is challenging as a result of the initial burst release. Employing a core-sheath design provides a promising solution for controlling the initial burst release. Numerous studies have reported on the preparation of core-sheath nanofibers by coaxial electrospinning for drug delivery applications. This paper summarizes the physical phenomena, the effects of various parameters in coaxial electrospinning, and the usefulness of core-sheath nanofibers in drug delivery. Furthermore, this report also highlights the future challenges involved in utilizing core-sheath nanofibers for drug delivery applications.",

The surface morphologies and structural characteristics of the PE-AC were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscope, Cs-corrected field-emission transmission electron microscope, and X-ray diffraction analysis, respectively. The nitrogen adsorption isotherm-desorption characteristics were confirmed by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, nonlocal density functional theory, and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda equations at 77 K. The results showed that the specific surface area and total pore volume of the activated samples increased with increasing the activation time. The specific surface area, the total pore volume, and mesopore volume of the PE-AC were found to be increased finally to 1600 m",

        "Abstract": "With the rapid development of nano-preparation processes, nanocrystalline materials have been widely developed in the fields of mechanics, electricity, optics, and thermal physics. Compared to the case of coarse-grained or amorphous materials, plastic deformation in nanomaterials is limited by the reduction in feature size, so that they generally have high strength, but the toughness is relatively high. The \"reciprocal relationship\" between the strength and toughness of nanomaterials limits the large-scale application and development of nanomaterials. Therefore, the maintenance of high toughness while improving the strength of nanomaterials is an urgent problem to be solved. So far, although the relevant mechanism affecting the deformation of nanocrystalline materials has made a big breakthrough, it is still not very clear. Therefore, this paper introduces the basic deformation type, mechanism, and model of single crystals, polycrystalline materials, and thin films, and aims to provide literature support for future research.",

        "Abstract": "Photocatalytic processes based on various semiconductors have been widely utilized in different applications, with great potential for use in environmental pollution remediation and sustainable energy generation. However, critical issues, including low light adsorption capability, wide energy bandgap, and unsatisfactory physicochemical stability still seriously limit the practical applications of photocatalysts. As a solution, the introduction of carbonaceous materials with different structures and properties into a photocatalyst system to further increase the activity has attracted much research attention. This mini review surveys the related literatures and highlights recent progress in the development of carbonaceous photocatalysts, which include various metal semiconductors with activated carbon, carbon dots, carbon nanotubes/nanofibers, graphene, fullerene, and carbon sponges/aerogels. Moreover, graphitic carbon nitride is also discussed as a carbon-rich and metal-free photocatalyst. The recently developed synthesis strategies and proposed mechanisms underlying the photocatalytic activity enhancement for different applications are summarized and discussed. Finally, ongoing challenges and the developmental direction for carbonaceous photocatalysts are proposed.",

        "Abstract": "A previous pharmacogenomic analysis identified cromolyn, an anti-allergic drug, as an effective anti-fibrotic agent that acts on hepatocytes and stellate cells. Furthermore, cromolyn was shown to be a G protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) agonist. However, it has not been studied whether anti-fibrotic effects are mediated by GPR35. Therefore, in this study, the role of GPR35 in hepatic fibrosis was investigated through the use of lodoxamide, another anti-allergic drug and a potent GPR35 agonist. Longterm treatment with carbon tetrachloride induced hepatic fibrosis, which was inhibited by treatment with lodoxamide. Furthermore, CID2745687, a specific GPR35 antagonist, reversed lodoxamide-mediated anti-fibrotic effects. In addition, lodoxamide treatment showed significant effects on the mRNA expression of collagen I\u03b11, collagen I\u03b12, and TGF-\u03b21 in the extracellular matrix. However, a transforming growth factor \u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1) shedding assay revealed lodoxamide not to be a potent agonist of mouse GPR35 ",

In the development of PCM technology, many types of materials have been studied, including inorganic salt and salt hydrates and organic matter such as paraffin and fatty acids. Considerable research has focused on the relationship between the material structure and energy storage properties to understand the heat storage/emission mechanism involved in controlling the energy storage performance of materials. In this study, we review the application of various carbon-filled organic PCMs in the field of heat storage and describe the current state of this research.",

        "Abstract": "A fast-charging battery that supplies maximum energy is a key element for vehicle electrification. High-capacity silicon anodes offer a viable alternative to carbonaceous materials, but they are vulnerable to fracture due to large volumetric changes during charge-discharge cycles. The low ionic and electronic transport across the silicon particles limits the charging rate of batteries. Here, as a three-in-one solution for the above issues, we show that small amounts of sulfur doping (<1 at%) render quasi-metallic silicon microparticles by substitutional doping and increase lithium ion conductivity through the flexible and robust self-supporting channels as demonstrated by microscopy observation and theoretical calculations. Such unusual doping characters are enabled by the simultaneous bottom-up assembly of dopants and silicon at the seed level in molten salts medium. This sulfur-doped silicon anode shows highly stable battery cycling at a fast-charging rate with a high energy density beyond those of a commercial standard anode.",

        "Abstract": "In the past few decades, organic thermoelectric materials/devices, which can exhibit remarkable potential in green energy conversion, have drawn great attention and interest due to their easy processing, light weight, intrinsically low thermal conductivity, and mechanical flexibility. Compared to traditional batteries, thermoelectric materials have high prospects as alternative power generators for harvesting green energy. Although crystalline inorganic semiconductors have dominated the fields of thermoelectric materials up to now, their practical applications are limited by their intrinsic fragility and high toxicity. The integration of organic polymers with inorganic nanoparticles has been widely employed to tailor the thermoelectric performance of polymers, which not only can combine the advantages of both components but also display interesting transport phenomena between organic polymers and inorganic nanoparticles. In this review, parameters affecting the thermoelectric properties of materials were briefly introduced. Some recently developed n-type and p-type thermoelectric films and related devices were illustrated along with their thermoelectric performance, methods of preparation, and future applications. This review will help beginners to quickly understand and master basic knowledge of thermoelectric materials, thus inspiring them to design and develop more efficient thermoelectric devices.",

        "Abstract": "A series of composites was prepared from a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) with different graphene filler contents to improve their mechanical performance and thermal stability. Graphene oxide (GO) and GO modified with hexamethylene tetraamine (HMTA) were selected as reinforcing agents. As a latent cationic initiator and curing agent, N-benzylepyrizinium hexafluoroantimonate (N-BPH) was used. The effect of fillers and their contents on the mechanical properties and thermal stability of the composites were studied. Fracture toughness improved by 23% and 40%, and fracture energy was enhanced by 1.94- and 2.27-fold, for the composites containing 0.04 wt.% GO and HMTA-GO, respectively. The gradual increase in fracture toughness at higher filler contents was attributed to both crack deflection and pinning mechanisms. Maximum thermal stability in the composites was achieved by using up to 0.1 wt.% graphene fillers.",

The photocatalytic degradation of pollutants by the TiO\u2082 spheres was evaluated based on the degradation of Rhodamine B (Rh B). In particular, the composites (GCN-TiO\u2082) containing 7 wt% GCN exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity. Owing to the presence of GCN, the composites showed improved light absorption capability, pair lifetime, adsorption capacity, and a reduced band gap energy (from 3.12 to 2.65 eV). Further, the composites showed excellent durability and stability even after fifth cycles.",

Transcranial colour-coded duplex sonography is a generally safe, repeatable, non-invasive, bedside technique that has a strong potential in neurocritical care patients in many clinical scenarios, including traumatic brain injury, aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest. Furthermore, the clinical applications of this technique may extend to different settings, including the general intensive care unit and the emergency department. Its increasing use reflects a growing interest in non-invasive cerebral and systemic assessment. The aim of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the basic and advanced principles underlying brain ultrasonography, and to review the different techniques and different clinical applications of this approach in the monitoring and treatment of critically ill patients.",

        "Abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic, pro-inflammatory metal ubiquitous in the diet that accumulates in body organs due to inefficient elimination. Responses to influenza virus infection are variable, particularly severity of pneumonia. We used a murine model of chronic low-dose oral exposure to Cd to test if increased lung tissue Cd worsened inflammation in response to sub-lethal H1N1 infection. The results show that Cd-treated mice had increased lung tissue inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, T lymphocytes and dendritic cells, following H1N1 infection. Lung genetic responses to infection (increasing TNF-\u03b1, interferon and complement, and decreasing myogenesis) were also exacerbated. To reveal the organization of a network structure, pinpointing molecules critical to Cd-altered lung function, global correlations were made for immune cell counts, leading edge gene transcripts and metabolites. This revealed that Cd increased correlation of myeloid immune cells with pro-inflammatory genes, particularly interferon-\u03b3 and metabolites. Together, the results show that Cd burden in mice increased inflammation in response to sub-lethal H1N1 challenge, which was coordinated by genetic and metabolic responses, and could provide new targets for intervention against lethal inflammatory pathology of clinical H1N1 infection.",

        "Abstract": "Carbon-based materials, including graphene, single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), are very promising materials for developing future-generation electronic devices. Their efficient physical, chemical, and electrical properties, such as high conductivity, efficient thermal and electrochemical stability, and high specific surface area, enable them to fulfill the requirements of modern electronic industries. In this review article, we discuss the synthetic methods of different functionalized carbon materials based on graphene oxide (GO), SWCNTs, MWCNTs, carbon fibers (CFs), and activated carbon (AC). Furthermore, we highlight the recent developments and applications of functionalized carbon materials in energy storage devices (supercapacitors), inkjet printing appliances, self-powered automatic sensing devices (biosensors, gas sensors, pressure sensors), and stretchable/flexible wearable electronic devices.",

        "Abstract": "With the continuous development and progress of materials science, increasingly more attention has been paid to the new technology of powder synthesis and material preparation. The hydrothermal method is a promising liquid phase preparation technology that has developed rapidly during recent years. It is widely used in many fields, such as the piezoelectric, ferroelectric, ceramic powder, and oxide film fields. The hydrothermal method has resulted in many new methods during the long-term research process, such as adding other force fields to the hydrothermal condition reaction system. These force fields mainly include direct current, electric, magnetic (autoclaves composed of non-ferroelectric materials), and microwave fields. Among them, the microwave hydrothermal method, as an extension of the hydrothermal reaction, cleverly uses the microwave temperature to compensate for the lack of temperature in the hydrothermal method, allowing better practical application. This paper reviews the development of the hydrothermal and microwave hydrothermal methods, introduces their reaction mechanisms, and focuses on the practical application of the two methods.",

        "Abstract": "Thermoelectric devices have recently attracted considerable interest owing to their unique ability of converting heat to electrical energy in an environmentally efficient manner. These devices are promising as alternative power generators for harvesting electrical energy compared to conventional batteries. Inorganic crystalline semiconductors have dominated the thermoelectric material fields; however, their application has been restricted by their intrinsic high toxicity, fragility, and high cost. In contrast, organic thermoelectric materials with low cost, low thermal conductivity, easy processing, and good flexibility are more suitable for fabricating thermoelectric devices. In this review, we briefly introduce the parameters affecting the thermoelectric performance and summarize the most recently developed carbon-material-based organic thermoelectric composites along with their preparation technologies, thermoelectric performance, and future applications. In addition, the p- and n-type carbon nanotube conversion and existing challenges are discussed. This review can help researchers in elucidating the recent studies on carbon-based organic thermoelectric materials, thus inspiring them to develop more efficient thermoelectric devices.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the significance of deep structural lesions for impairment of consciousness following hemorrhagic stroke and recovery at ICU discharge. Our study focused on deep lesions that previously were implicated in studies of disorders of consciousness. We analyzed MRI measures obtained within the first week of the bleed and command following throughout the ICU stay. A machine learning approach was applied to identify MRI findings that best predicted the level consciousness. From 158 intracerebral hemorrhage patients that underwent MRI, one third was unconscious at the time of MRI and half of these patients recovered consciousness by ICU discharge. Deep structural lesions predicted both, impairment and recovery of consciousness, together with established measures of mass effect. Lesions in the midbrain peduncle and pontine tegmentum alongside the caudate nucleus were implicated as critical structures. Unconscious patients predicted to recover consciousness by ICU discharge had better long-term functional outcomes than those predicted to remain unconscious.",

        "Abstract": "Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive material formed by the slow decay of uranium and thorium found in the earth's crust or construction materials. Internal exposure to radon accounts for about half of the natural background radiation dose to which humans are exposed annually. Radon is a carcinogen and is the second leading cause of lung cancer following smoking. An association between radon and lung cancer has been consistently reported in epidemiological studies on mine workers and the general population with indoor radon exposure. However, associations have not been clearly established between radon and other diseases, such as leukemia and thyroid cancer. Radiation doses are assessed by applying specific dose conversion coefficients according to the source (e.g., radon or thoron) and form of exposure (e.g., internal or external). However, regardless of the source or form of exposure, the effects of a given estimated dose on human health are identical, assuming that individuals have the same sensitivity to radiation. Recently, radiation exceeding the annual dose limit of the general population (1 mSv/yr) was detected in bed mattresses produced by D company due to the use of a monazite-based anion powder containing uranium and thorium. This has sparked concerns about the health hazards for mattress users caused by radiation exposure. In light of this event, this study presents scientific information about the assessment of radon and thoron exposure and its human implications for human health, which have emerged as a recent topic of interest and debate in society.",

        "Abstract": "Fast charging rate and large energy storage are becoming key elements for the development of next-generation batteries, targeting high-performance electric vehicles. Developing electrodes with high volumetric and gravimetric capacity that could be operated at a high rate is the most challenging part of this process. Using silicon as the anode material, which exhibits the highest theoretical capacity as a lithium-ion battery anode, we report a binder-free electrode that interconnects carbon-sheathed porous silicon nanowires into a coral-like network and shows fast charging performance coupled to high energy and power densities when integrated into a full cell with a high areal capacity loading. The combination of interconnected nanowires, porous structure, and a highly conformal carbon coating in a single system strongly promotes the reaction kinetics of the electrode. This leads to fast-charging capability while maintaining the integrity of the electrode without structural collapse and, thus, stable cycling performance without using binder and conductive additives. Specifically, this anode shows high specific capacities (over 1200 mAh g",

        "Abstract": "Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) requires anticoagulation to promote vessel recanalization. Current anticoagulation paradigms utilize plasma tests from peripheral venous/arterial samples for therapeutic monitoring. We describe a medically-refractory case of CVST in a 35-year-old woman later found to have JAK2 mutation and essential thrombocytosis. Despite therapeutic anticoagulation levels, worsening cerebral edema and progression to coma prompted endovascular treatment. Failed endovascular thrombectomy attempts led to placement of 2 separate indwelling microcatheters for continuous infusion of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Forty-hours of continuous-tPA in addition to systemic intravenous-heparin led to complete radiographic and clinical resolution of CVST. Whole blood coagulation testing using Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) from simultaneous samples taken intracranially (via cerebral microcatheters) and peripherally (via antecubital vein) all revealed prolonged intrinsic pathway activation clotting times consistent with heparin anticoagulation use. However, both intracranial ROTEM samples identified faster clotting times compared to the peripheral sample suggesting lower anticoagulation levels intracranially. Our findings were speculative and hypothesis generating as to whether this explained medical treatment failure. If there are coagulopathy differences at local sites of injury not adequately captured by peripheral blood draws, further investigation is required to identify better approaches to avoid under-treatment of similar cases.",

        "Abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) causes acute and chronic lung toxicities at occupational exposure levels, yet the impacts of Cd exposure at low levels through dietary intake remain largely uncharacterized. Health concerns arise because humans do not have an effective Cd elimination mechanism, resulting in a long (10- to 35-y) biological half-life. Previous studies showed increased mitochondrial oxidative stress and cell death by Cd yet the details of mitochondrial alterations by low levels of Cd remain unexplored. In the current study, we examined the impacts of Cd burden at a low environmental level on lung metabolome, redox proteome, and inflammation in mice given Cd at low levels by drinking water (0, 0.2, 0.6 and 2.0\u202fmg\u202fCd/L) for 16 weeks. The results showed that mice accumulated lung Cd comparable to non-smoking humans and showed inflammation in lung by histopathology at 2\u202fmg\u202fCd/L. The results of high resolution metabolomics combined with bioinformatics showed that mice treated with 2\u202fmg\u202fCd/L increased levels of lipids in the lung, accompanied by disruption in mitochondrial energy metabolism. In addition, targeted metabolomic analysis showed that these mice had increased accumulation of mitochondrial carnitine and citric acid cycle intermediates. The results of redox proteomics showed that Cd at 2\u202fmg/L stimulated oxidation of isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and ATP synthase. Taken together, the results showed impaired mitochondrial function and accumulation of lipids in the lung with a Cd dose response relevant to non-smokers without occupational exposures. These findings suggest that dietary Cd intake could be an important variable contributing to human pulmonary disorders.",

We conducted a prospective cohort study to determine whether Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) scores could be used to reliably diagnose delirium in the setting of brain injury.

        "Abstract": "In this study, a homogeneous and stable dispersion of graphene oxide (GO)/carbon nanotube (CNT) complexes (GCCs) was obtained by dispersing CNTs in an aqueous solution using GO in the absence of dispersing agents. Furthermore, carboxymethyl cellulose/GCC (CMC/GCC) nanocomposite films were prepared by a simple solution mixing-evaporation method. The dispersibility of the GCCs with different CNT contents was investigated by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The morphological and crystalline structures of the samples were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy were conducted to identify the chemical composition of GO, CNTs, and GCCs. These results revealed that CNTs could be stably dispersed in water using GO. In addition, when CMC/GCC nanocomposite films were prepared by mixing CMC and GCCs, CNTs were uniformly dispersed in the CMC matrix. The tensile behavior was investigated using a universal testing machine. The tensile strength and Young's modulus of the CMC/GCC nanocomposite films were significantly improved by up to about 121% and 122%, respectively, compared to those of pure CMC because of uniform and strong \u03c0-\u03c0 interfacial interactions between CNTs and CMC polymer.",

        "Abstract": "Chiral differentiation of protonated isoleucine (Ile) using permethylated \u03b2-cyclodextrin (perCD) in the gas-phase was studied using infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy, ion-mobility, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The gaseous protonated non-covalent complexes of perCD and d-Ile or l-Ile produced by electrospray ionization were interrogated by laser pulses in the wavenumber region of 2650 to 3800 cm-1. The IRMPD spectra showed remarkably different IR spectral features for the d-Ile or l-Ile and perCD non-covalent complexes. However, drift-tube ion-mobility experiments provided only a small difference in their collision cross-sections, and thus a limited separation of the d- and l-Ile complexes. DFT calculations revealed that the chiral distinction of the d- and l-complexes by IRMPD spectroscopy resulted from local interactions of the protonated Ile with perCD. Furthermore, the theoretical results showed that the IR absorption spectra of higher energy conformers (by \u223c13.7 kcal mol-1) matched best with the experimentally observed IRMPD spectra. These conformers are speculated to be formed from kinetic-trapping of the solution-phase conformers. This study demonstrated that IRMPD spectroscopy provides an excellent platform for differentiating the subtle chiral difference of a small amino acid in a cyclodextrin-complexation environment; however, drift-tube ion-mobility did not have sufficient resolution to distinguish the chiral difference.",

        "Abstract": "Fly ash (FA), a solid waste generated in thermal power plants, is considered an environmental pollutant. Therefore, measures must be taken to dispose of FA in an environmentally friendly manner. In this paper, an electrospinning technique was employed to incorporate FA particles onto zinc oxide nanofibers (ZnO NFs), and the product (FA/ZnO composite) was used for the removal of methylene blue (MB) from the water. Herein, ZnO NFs may serve as effective semiconductor photocatalysts and provide sufficient surface area for FA, while the FA particles serve as an effective adsorbent. The adsorption capacity and photocatalytic efficiency of the as-synthesized nanocomposite fibers were enhanced compared to those of the pristine ZnO NFs, and this result is attributed to the uniform distribution of FA on the surface of the ZnO NFs. The as-synthesized nanocomposite could have great significance in wastewater treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Intramuscular (IM) vaccination with formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (FI-RSV) failed in clinical trials due to vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease. To test the efficacy of skin vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), we investigated the immunogenicity, efficacy, and inflammatory disease after microneedle (MN) patch delivery of FI-RSV vaccine (FI-RSV MN) to the mouse skin with or without an adjuvant of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). Compared to IM vaccination, MN patch delivery of FI-RSV was more effective in clearing lung viral loads and preventing weight loss, and in diminishing inflammation, infiltrating immune cells, and T helper type 2 (Th2) CD4 T cell responses after RSV challenge. With MPL adjuvant, MN patch delivery of FI-RSV significantly increased the immunogenicity and efficacy as well as preventing RSV disease as evidenced by lung viral clearance and avoiding pulmonary histopathology. Improved efficacy and prevention of disease by FI-RSV MN with MPL were correlated with no sign of airway resistance, lower levels of Th2 cytokines and infiltrating innate inflammatory cells, and higher levels of Th1 T cell responses into the lung. This study suggests that MN patch delivery of RSV vaccines to the skin with MPL adjuvant would be a promising vaccination method.",

        "Abstract": "Although GPR35 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, synthetic agonists and antagonists have been developed. Recently, cromolyn, a mast cell stabilizer, was reported as an agonist of GPR35 and was shown to exhibit antifibrotic effects through its actions on hepatocytes and stellate cells. In this study, the role of GPR35 in hepatic steatosis was investigated using an in vitro model of liver X receptor (LXR)-mediated hepatocellular steatosis and an in vivo model of high fat diet-induced liver steatosis. GPR35 was expressed in Hep3B human hepatoma cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. A specific LXR activator, T0901317, induced lipid accumulation in Hep3B cells. Lodoxamide, the most potent agonist of GPR35, inhibited lipid accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. The protective effect of lodoxamide was inhibited by a specific GPR35 antagonist, CID2745687, and by siRNA-mediated knockdown of GPR35. The expression of SREBP-1c, a key transcription factor for lipid synthesis, was induced by T0901317 and the induction was inhibited by lodoxamide. Through the use of specific inhibitors of cellular signaling components, the lodoxamide-induced inhibition of lipid accumulation was found to be mediated through p38 MAPKs and JNK, but not through G",

We investigated the effects of OL increase in bacterial membranes on pathogen virulence and the host immune response. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we increased OL levels in membranes by overexpressing the OL-synthesizing operon (olsBA). These increases changed the bacterial surface charge and hydrophobicity, which reduced bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), interfered with the binding of macrophages to bacterial cells and enhanced bacterial biofilm formation. When grown under low phosphate conditions, P. aeruginosa became more persistent in the treatment of antibiotics and AMPs in an olsBA-dependent manner. While OLs increased persistence, they attenuated P. aeruginosa virulence; in host cells, they reduced the production of inflammatory factors (iNOS, COX-2, PGE",

        "Abstract": "Starting with the Internet of Things (IoT), new forms of system operation concepts have emerged to provide creative services through collaborations among autonomic devices. Following these paradigmatic changes, the ability of each participating system to automatically diagnose the degree of quality it is providing is inevitable. This paper proposed a method to automatically detect symptoms that hinder certain quality attributes. The method consisted of three steps: (1) extracting information from real usage logs and automatically generating an activity model from the captured information; (2) merging multiple user activity models into a single, representative model; and (3) detecting differences between the representative user activity model, and an expected activity model. The proposed method was implemented in a domain-independent framework, workable on the Android platform. Unlike other related works, we used quantitative evaluation results to show the benefits of applying the proposed method to five Android-based, open-source mobile applications. The evaluation results showed that the average precision rate for the automatic detection of symptoms was 70%, and the success rate for user implementation of usage scenarios demonstrated an improvement of around 21%, when the automatically detected symptoms were resolved.",

        "Abstract": "Hyaluronidases are a family of enzymes that catalyse the breakdown of hyaluronic acid, which is abundant in the extracellular matrix and cumulus oocyte complex. To investigate the activity of recombinant bovine sperm hyaluronidase 1 (SPAM1) and determine the effect of the Asn-X-Ser/Thr motif on its activity, the bovine SPAM1 open reading frame was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCXN2 and then transfected to the HEK293 cell line. Expression of recombinant bovine hyaluronidase was estimated using a hyaluronidase activity assay with gel electrophoresis. Recombinant hyaluronidase could resolve highly polymeric hyaluronic acid and also caused dispersal of the cumulus cell layer. Comparative analysis with respect to enzyme activity was carried out for the glycosylated and deglycosylated bovine sperm hyaluronidase by N-glycosidase F treatment. Finally, mutagenesis analysis revealed that among the five potential N-linked glycosylation sites, only three contributed to significant inhibition of hyaluronic activity. Recombinant bovine SPAM1 has hyaluronan degradation and cumulus oocyte complex dispersion ability, and the N-linked oligosaccharides are important for enzyme activity, providing a foundation for the commercialization of hyaluronidase.",

        "Abstract": "Nanowires (NWs) synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) have demonstrated significant improvement in lithium storage performance along with their outstanding accommodation of large volume changes during the charge/discharge process. Nevertheless, NW electrodes have been confined to the research level due to the lack of scalability and severe side reactions by their high surface area. Here, we present nanoporous Ge nanofibers (NPGeNFs) having moderate nanoporosity via a combination of simple electrospinning and a low-energetic zincothermic reduction reaction. In contrast with the CVD-assisted NW growth, our method provides high tunability of macro/microscopic morphologies such as a porosity, length, and diameter of the nanoscale 1D structures. Significantly, the customized NPGeNFs showed a highly suppressed volume expansion of less than 15% (for electrodes) after full lithation and excellent durability with high lithium storage performance over 500 cycles. Our approach offers effective 1D nanostructuring with highly customized geometries and can be extended to other applications including optoelectronics, catalysis, and energy conversion.",

However, the large volume change of silicon upon lithiation/delithiation poses a critical challenge for stable battery operations. Here, we introduce an unprecedented design, which takes advantage of large deformation and ensures the structural stability of the material by developing a two-dimensional silicon nanosheet coated with a thin carbon layer. During electrochemical cycling, this carbon coated silicon nanosheet exhibits unique deformation patterns, featuring accommodation of deformation in the thickness direction upon lithiation, while forming ripples upon delithiation, as demonstrated by in situ transmission electron microscopy observation and chemomechanical simulation. The ripple formation presents a unique mechanism for releasing the cycling induced stress, rendering the electrode much more stable and durable than the uncoated counterparts. This work demonstrates a general principle as how to take the advantage of the large deformation materials for designing high capacity electrode.",

        "Abstract": "As human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common cause of disease in newborns and transplant recipients, developing an HCMV vaccine is considered a major public health priority. Yet an HCMV vaccine candidate remains elusive. Although the precise HCMV immune correlates of protection are unclear, both humoral and cellular immune responses have been implicated in protection against HCMV infection and disease. Here we describe a vaccine approach based on the well-characterized modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vector to stimulate robust HCMV humoral and cellular immune responses by an antigen combination composed of the envelope pentamer complex (PC), glycoprotein B (gB), and phosphoprotein 65 (pp65). We show that in mice, multiantigenic MVA vaccine vectors simultaneously expressing all five PC subunits, gB, and pp65 elicit potent complement-independent and complement-dependent HCMV neutralizing antibodies as well as mouse and human MHC-restricted, polyfunctional T cell responses by the individual antigens. In addition, we demonstrate that the PC/gB antigen combination of these multiantigenic MVA vectors can enhance the stimulation of humoral immune responses that mediate ",

The MnO2/RGO composite with optimized molar concentration of manganese precursors in fixed graphene oxide mass was showed the highest specific capacitance of 186 F/g at 1 A/g. In addition, cycle life performance of MnO2/RGO composite was improved by using graphene having high electrical conductivity as a substrate. This result was related with prevention for collapse of the manganese nanoparticle. The structure and morphology analysis was confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). FE-SEM images explicitly revealed that MnO2 particles were attached on reduced graphene oxide layers.",

This was achieved by reacting graphene oxide (GO) layers with titanium isopropoxide as the TiO2 precursor. The TGS exhibited superior efficiency compared to pristine TiO2 and the best results were recorded for the TGS-0.05 sample. The presence of the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) component was determined to be an important factor governing the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pair via interfacial charge transfer. The significantly increased activity of the TGS under simulated solar light in the degradation of methylene blue (MB) indicates that these materials are promising photocatalysts for efficient water purification.",

The NDG was synthesized using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal (MHT) method as a function of MHT time. The morphology and structure of Ag-TiO2/GO nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The photocatalytic activity of Ag-TiO2/GO nanocomposites in visible light was explored using the degradation, of methylene blue (MB) dye under the ultraviolet (UV) light. The result showed that Ag-TiO2/GO-3 was very efficient for the degradation of MB with nitrogen doping time. The degradation efficiency of the photocatalytic nanoparticles after 6 h of irradiation was about 80%. Increasing the N-doping time increased their hydrophilicity, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of Ag-TiO2/GO nanocomposites.",

        "Abstract": "A combination of electrospinning technique and hydrothermal process was carried out to fabricate zinc oxide nano-flakes wrapped carbon nanofibers (ZnO/CNFs) composite as an effective electrode material for supercapacitor. The morphology of the as-synthesized composite clearly revealed that the carbon nanofibers were successfully wrapped with ZnO nano-flakes. The electrochemical performance of the as-synthesized nanocomposite electrode was evaluated by the cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GDC), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and compared with the pristine ZnO nanofibers. It was found that the composite exhibited a higher specific capacitance (260 F/g) as compared to pristine ZnO NFs (118 F/g) at the scan rate of 5\u202fmV/s. Furthermore, the ZnO/CNFs composite also exhibited good capacity retention (73.33%). The obtained results indicated great potential applications of ZnO/CNFs composite in developing energy storage devices with high energy and power densities. The present work might provide a new route for utilizing ZnO based composites for energy storage applications.",

Models were trained on 80%, while 20% were set aside for validation testing. Baseline information and standard grading scales were evaluated: age, sex, Hunt Hess grade, modified Fisher Scale (mFS), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). An unsupervised approach applying random kernels was used to extract features from physiological time series (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation). Classifiers (Partial Least Squares, linear and kernel Support Vector Machines) were trained on feature subsets of the derivation dataset. Models were applied to the validation dataset. The performances of the best classifiers on the validation dataset are reported by feature subset. Standard grading scale (mFS): AUC 0.58. Combined demographics and grading scales: AUC 0.60. Random kernel derived physiologic features: AUC 0.74. Combined baseline and physiologic features with redundant feature reduction: AUC 0.77. Current DCI prediction tools rely on admission imaging and are advantageously simple to employ. However, using an agnostic and computationally inexpensive learning approach for high-frequency physiologic time series data, we demonstrated that our models achieve higher classification accuracy.",

        "Abstract": "Randomized experiments are often complicated because of treatment noncompliance. This challenge prevents researchers from identifying the mediated portion of the intention-to-treated (ITT) effect, which is the effect of the assigned treatment that is attributed to a mediator. One solution suggests identifying the mediated ITT effect on the basis of the average causal mediation effect among compliers when there is a single mediator. However, considering the complex nature of the mediating mechanisms, it is natural to assume that there are multiple variables that mediate through the causal path. Motivated by an empirical analysis of a data set collected in a randomized interventional study, we develop a method to estimate the mediated portion of the ITT effect when both multiple dependent mediators and treatment noncompliance exist. This enables researchers to make an informed decision on how to strengthen the intervention effect by identifying relevant mediators despite treatment noncompliance. We propose a nonparametric estimation procedure and provide a sensitivity analysis for key assumptions. We conduct a Monte Carlo simulation study to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed approach. The proposed method is illustrated by an empirical analysis of JOBS II data, in which a job training intervention was used to prevent mental health deterioration among unemployed individuals.",

        "Abstract": "Considering that causal mechanisms unfold over time, it is important to investigate the mechanisms over time, taking into account the time-varying features of treatments and mediators. However, identification of the average causal mediation effect in the presence of time-varying treatments and mediators is often complicated by time-varying confounding. This article aims to provide a novel approach to uncovering causal mechanisms in time-varying treatments and mediators in the presence of time-varying confounding. We provide different strategies for identification and sensitivity analysis under homogeneous and heterogeneous effects. Homogeneous effects are those in which each individual experiences the same effect, and heterogeneous effects are those in which the effects vary over individuals. Most importantly, we provide an alternative definition of average causal mediation effects that evaluates a partial mediation effect; the effect that is mediated by paths other than through an intermediate confounding variable. We argue that this alternative definition allows us to better assess at least a part of the mediated effect and provides meaningful and unique interpretations. A case study using ECLS-K data that evaluates kindergarten retention policy is offered to illustrate our proposed approach.",

        "Abstract": "With the emergence of various forms of smart devices and new paradigms such as the Internet of Things (IoT) concept, the IT (Information Technology) service areas are expanding explosively compared to the provision of services by single systems. A new system operation concept that has emerged in accordance with such technical trends is the IT ecosystem. The IT ecosystem can be considered a special type of system of systems in which multiple systems with various degrees of autonomy achieve common goals while adapting to the given environment. The single systems that participate in the IT ecosystem adapt autonomously to the current situation based on collected data from sensors. Furthermore, to maintain the services supported by the whole IT ecosystem sustainably, the configuration of single systems that participate in the IT ecosystem also changes appropriately in accordance with the changed situation. In order to support the IT ecosystem, this paper proposes an architecture framework that supports dynamic configuration changes to achieve the goal of the whole IT ecosystem, while ensuring the autonomy of single systems through the collection of data from sensors so as to recognize the situational context of individual participating systems. For the feasibility evaluation of the proposed framework, a simulated example of an IT ecosystem for unmanned forest management was constructed, and the quantitative evaluation results are discussed in terms of the extent to which the proposed architecture framework can continuously provide sustainable services in response to diverse environmental context changes.",

Reduced platelet function after the initial bleed is associated with higher risk of early rebleeding. Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a well-known hemostatic agent, and recent guidelines already suggest its use in individuals exposed to antiplatelet drugs. The authors hypothesized that DDAVP administration in patients with SAH at admission would be associated with lower risks of rebleeding.",

        "Abstract": "We present a simple, versatile approach to generate highly ordered nanostructures of block copolymers (BCPs) using rubbed surfaces. A block of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) was dragged across a flat substrate surface above the melting point of PTFE transferring a highly aligned PTFE topographic pattern to the substrate. Si wafer, glass, and polyimide films were used as substrates. Thin films of cylinder-forming asymmetric polystyrene-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine) copolymers (S2VPs) were solvent annealed on the surfaces having the transferred surface pattern to induce their directed self-assembly. Cylinders of P2VP oriented normal to the surface are markedly aligned along the rubbing direction and used as templates to generate extremely uniform arrays of various metallic nanoparticles of gold, silver, and platinum over a large area.",

We made and used a folded graphene composite electrode designed for a high areal capacity anode. The traditional thick graphene composite electrode, such as made by filtering graphene oxide to create a thin film and reducing it such as through chemical or thermal methods, has sluggish reaction kinetics. Instead, we have made and tested a thin composite film electrode that was folded several times using a water-assisted method; it provides a continuous electron transport path in the fold regions and introduces more channels between the folded layers, which significantly enhances the electron/ion transport kinetics.

        "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown that adults are able to remember more than 1,000 images with great detail. However, little is known about the development of this visual capacity, nor its presence early in life. This study tests the level of detail of young children's memory for a large number of items, adapting the method of Brady, Konkle, Alvarez, and Oliva (2008). Four- and six-year-old children were shown more than 100 images of everyday objects. They were then tested for recognition of familiar items in a binary decision task. The identity of the foil test item was manipulated in three conditions (Category, Exemplar, and State). Children demonstrated high accuracy across all conditions, remembering not only the basic-level category (Category), but also unique details (Exemplar), and information about position and arrangement of parts (State). These findings demonstrate that children spontaneously encode a high degree of visual detail. Early in life, visual memory exhibits high fidelity and extends over a large set of items.",

        "Abstract": "Printing is one of the easy and quick ways to make a stretchable wearable electronics. Conventional printing methods deposit conductive materials \"on\" or \"inside\" a rubber substrate. The conductors made by such printing methods cannot be used as device electrodes because of the large surface topology, poor stretchability, or weak adhesion between the substrate and the conducting material. Here, a method is presented by which conductive materials are printed in the way of being surface-embedded in the rubber substrate; hence, the conductors can be widely used as device electrodes and circuits. The printing process involves a direct printing of a metal precursor solution in a block-copolymer rubber substrate and chemical reduction of the precursor into metal nanoparticles. The electrical conductivity and sensitivity to the mechanical deformation can be controlled by adjusting the number of printing operations. The fabrication of highly sensitive vibration sensors is thus presented, which can detect weak pulses and sound waves. In addition, this work takes advantage of the viscoelasticity of the composite conductor to fabricate highly conductive stretchable circuits for complicated 3D structures. The printed electrodes are also used to fabricate a stretchable electrochemiluminescence display.",

Prevention of vasospasm-induced delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage depends on optimization of cerebral perfusion pressure, which can be challenged by neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy.

        "Abstract": "Hepatic problems related to a Fontan circulation have been highlighted and elastography using ultrasound is a non-invasive tool that can measure the severity of hepatic stiffness. We investigated the hepatic stiffness using shear wave elastography (SWE) and related factors in patients with a Fontan circulation. This study enrolled 64 patients with a Fontan circulation who underwent cardiac catheterization and abdominal ultrasound from 2011 to 2015. The correlation between the laboratory tests, hemodynamic factors by cardiac catheterization, and SWE was evaluated. The patients were classified into non-cirrhotic level (\u2265\u00a02.0\u00a0m/s) and cirrhotic level (<\u00a02.0\u00a0m/s) groups by the SWE value. The mean age was 17.6\u00a0years and the mean duration after the Fontan operation was 12.1\u00a0years. The mean value of SWE in patients (1.95\u00a0m/s) was higher than the normal (<\u00a01.3\u00a0m/s). The SWE was higher in patients without than those with a fenestration (2.03 vs. 1.75\u00a0m/s, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003). In a multiple regression analysis between SWE and other factors, the CVP, fenestration, and lipoprotein Apo B had a significant correlation. In a multivariate analysis of cirrhotic level group, the CVP was the only significant factor. The hepatic stiffness had significantly progressed in most patients with a Fontan circulation. A low CVP and Fontan circulation with a fenestration might reduce the progression of the hepatic stiffness.",

A\u03b2 has been widely used to mimic several aspects of Alzheimer's disease. However, several characteristics of amyloid-induced Alzheimer's disease pathology are not well established, especially in mice. The present study aimed to develop a new Alzheimer's disease model by investigating how A\u03b2 can be effectively aggregated using prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To express the A\u03b242 complex in HEK293 cells, we cloned the A\u03b242 region in a tandem repeat and incorporated the resulting construct into a eukaryotic expression vector. Following transfection into HEK293 cells via lipofection, cell viability assay and western blotting analysis revealed that exogenous A\u03b242 can induce cell death and apoptosis. In addition, recombinant His-tagged A\u03b242 was successfully expressed in ",

        "Abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion (F) protein is suggested to be a protective vaccine target although its efficacy and safety concerns remain not well understood. We investigated immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety of F proteins in a soluble form or on virus-like particle (F-VLP). F VLP preferentially elicited IgG2a antibody and T helper type 1 (Th1) immune responses whereas F protein induced IgG1 isotype and Th2 responses. Despite lung viral clearance after prime or prime-boost and then RSV challenge, F protein immune mice displayed weight loss and lung histopathology and high mucus production and eosinophils. In contrast, prime or prime-boost vaccination of F VLP induced effective protection, prevented infiltration of eosinophils and vaccine- enhanced disease after challenge. This study provides insight into developing an effective and safe RSV vaccine candidate.",

        "Abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the most commonly occurring chronic liver disease, and hepatic steatosis, a condition defined as extensive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, is associated with liver dysfunction and metabolic diseases, such as, obesity and type II diabetes. Apelin is an adipokine that acts on a G protein-coupled receptor named APJ, and has been established to play pivotal roles in various physiological conditions. However, the function of apelin in hepatocytes has not been fully investigated. In order to assess the functional roles of apelin and APJ in hepatocytes, we used an in vitro model of liver X receptor (LXR)-mediated hepatocellular steatosis. In Hep3B human hepatoma cells, T0901317 (a specific LXR activator) induced lipid accumulation and this was inhibited by apelin. T0901317 also induced the expression of SREBP-1c, a key transcription factor for lipogenesis. Apelin not only inhibited SREBP-1c induction at the mRNA and protein levels but also induced lipolytic PPAR\u03b1 expression. Furthermore, these protective effects of apelin were inhibited by apelin F13A (a specific APJ antagonist). Furthermore, silencing of APJ by siRNA transfection also inhibited the actions of apelin. Specific inhibitors of cellular signaling components showed inhibition of lipid accumulation by apelin was mediated through G",

        "Abstract": "Controlling the morphology of nanostructured silicon is critical to improving the structural stability and electrochemical performance in lithium-ion batteries. The use of removable or sacrificial templates is an effective and easy route to synthesize hollow materials. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of mesoporous silicon hollow nanocubes (m-Si HCs) derived from a metal-organic framework (MOF) as an anode material with outstanding electrochemical properties. The m-Si HC architecture with the mesoporous external shell (\u223c15 nm) and internal void (\u223c60 nm) can effectively accommodate volume variations and relieve diffusion-induced stress/strain during repeated cycling. In addition, this cube architecture provides a high electrolyte contact area because of the exposed active site, which can promote the transportation of Li ions. The well-designed m-Si HC with carbon coating delivers a high reversible capacity of 1728 mAhg",

        "Title": "Moderated surface defects of Ni particles encapsulated with NiO nanofibers as supercapacitor with high capacitance and energy density.",
        "Abstract": "Nickel oxide is a promising material for supercapacitors owing to its high theoretical specific capacitance; however, its practical capacitance is far below the theoretical limit. In this work, we report a novel Ni/NiO composite supported by carbon nanofibers as a pseudocapacitor electrode. Characterization of this sample by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis, and contact angle measurements revealed that Ni nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the surface of the nanofibers, leading to strong metal-metal oxide interactions and the formation of oxygen vacancies. Such three dimensional hetero-Ni/NiO components afford high conductivity owing to efficient electron transport and abundant surface defects (oxygen vacancies), which result in enhanced supercapacitor performance and energy density (ED). A moderate concentration of oxygen vacancies is crucial for achieving optimized electrochemical activity. As-prepared Ni/NiO-3 nanofibers generated high capacitances of 526 and 400F/g at current densities of 1 and 10A/g, respectively, with good stability (80% of the initial capacitance retained after 1000 cycles). Moreover, an ED as high as 65.8Wh/kg was achieved at a power density of 900W/kg, which is higher than those of NiO-based supercapacitors. This work provides a strategy for improving the potential of metal oxides for energy storage applications.",

Deposition of N-CDs onto the surface of BiOBr was confirmed through structure and composition characterizations. The N-CDs/BiOBr composites exhibited superior activity for organic contaminant degradation under visible light and the 1\u2009wt% N-CDs/BiOBr composite showed the highest degradation rate, indicating that N-CDs/BiOBr composites have great potential for application in mitigating hazardous contaminants. The N-CDs played an important role in improving the photocatalytic performance, owing to the enhancement of up-converted photoluminescence behavior as well as the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers originating from the intimately contacted interface. A possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed based on the experimental results.",

        "Title": "\u03c9-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids accelerate airway repair by activating FFA4 in club cells.",
        "Abstract": "A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) named free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFA4, also known as GPR120) was found to act as a GPCR for \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Its expression has been reported in lung epithelial club cells. We investigated whether supplementation of the \u03c9-3 fatty acids benefits lung health. Omacor (7.75 mg/kg), clinically prescribed preparation of \u03c9-3 fatty acids, and FFA4-knockout mice were utilized in a naphthalene-induced mouse model of acute airway injury (1 injection of 30 mg/kg ip). Naphthalene injection induced complete destruction of bronchiolar epithelial cells within a day. Appearance of bronchiolar epithelial cells was observed after 21 days in control mice. It was found, however, that supplementation of Omacor accelerated the recovery. The appearance of bronchiolar epithelial cells was observed between 7 and 14 days after naphthalene injury in Omacor-treated mice. In isolated club cells, \u03c9-3 fatty acids were found to stimulate cell proliferation and migration but to inhibit cell differentiation. With the use of pharmacological tools and FFA4-knockout mice, FFA4 was found to be responsible for \u03c9-3 fatty acids-induced proliferation in vitro in club cells. Furthermore, accelerated recovery from naphthalene-induced airway injury in Omacor-treated mice was not observed in FFA4-knockout mice in vivo. Present findings indicate that \u03c9-3 fatty acids-induced proliferation of bronchiole epithelial cells through FFA4 is responsible for Omacor-induced accelerated recovery from airway injury. Therefore, intermittent administration of Omacor needs to be tested for acute airway injury because \u03c9-3 fatty acids stimulate proliferation but inhibit differentiation of club cells.",

This study demonstrates the immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety of virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines containing RSV F (F VLP), G (G VLP), or F and G proteins (FG VLP) in cotton rats. RSV specific antibodies were effectively induced by vaccination of cotton rats with F VLP or FG VLP vaccines. After challenge, lung RSV clearance was observed with RSV F, G, FG VLP, and formalin inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccines. Upon RSV infection, cotton rats with RSV VLP vaccines were protected against airway hyper-responsiveness and weight loss, which are different from FI-RSV vaccination exhibiting vaccine-enhanced disease of airway obstruction, weight loss, and severe histopathology with eosinophilia and mucus production. FG VLP and F VLP vaccines did not cause pulmonary inflammation whereas G VLP induced moderate lung inflammation with eosinophilia and mucus production. In particular, F VLP and FG VLP vaccines were found to be effective in inducing antibody secreting cell responses in bone marrow and lymphoid organs as well as avoiding the induction of T helper type 2 cytokines. These results provide further evidence to develop a safe RSV vaccine based on VLP platforms.",

        "Abstract": "Texture provides crucial information about the category or identity of a scene. Nonetheless, not much is known about how the texture information in a scene is represented in the brain. Previous studies have shown that the parahippocampal place area (PPA), a scene-selective part of visual cortex, responds to simple patches of texture ensemble. However, in natural scenes textures exist in spatial context within a scene. Here we tested two hypotheses that make different predictions on how textures within a scene context are represented in the PPA. The Texture-Only hypothesis suggests that the PPA represents texture ensemble (i.e., the kind of texture) as is, irrespective of its location in the scene. On the other hand, the Texture and Location hypothesis suggests that the PPA represents texture and its location within a scene (e.g., ceiling or wall) conjointly. We tested these two hypotheses across two experiments, using different but complementary methods. In ",

In particular, mesoporous materials have many advantages including a high surface area and large void spaces which can increase reactivity and accessibility of lithium ions. This study reports a synthesis of newly developed mesoporous germanium (Ge) particles prepared by a zincothermic reduction at a mild temperature for high performance lithium-ion batteries which can operate in a wide temperature range. The optimized Ge battery anodes with the mesoporous structure exhibit outstanding electrochemical properties in a wide temperature ranging from -20 to 60 \u00b0C. Ge anodes exhibit a stable cycling retention at various temperatures (capacity retention of 99% after 100 cycles at 25 \u00b0C, 84% after 300 cycles at 60 \u00b0C, and 50% after 50 cycles at -20 \u00b0C).

        "Abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) hyperporous silicon flakes (HPSFs) are prepared via the chemical reduction of natural clay minerals bearing metal oxides. Natural clays generally have 2D flake-like structures with broad size distributions in the lateral dimension and varied thicknesses depending on the first processing condition from nature. They have repeating layers of silicate and metal oxides in various ratios. When the clay mineral is subjected to a reduction reaction, metal oxide layers can perform a negative catalyst for absorbing large amounts of exothermic heat from the reduction reaction of the silicate layers with metal reductant. Selectively etching out metal oxides shows a hyperporous nanoflake structure containing 100 nm macropores and meso-/micropores on its framework. The resultant HPSFs are demonstrated as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Compared to conventional micro-Si anodes, HPSFs exhibit exceptionally high initial Coulombic efficiency over 92%. Furthermore, HPSF anodes show outstanding cycling performance (reversible capacity of 1619 mAh g",

        "Title": "Metabolic pathways of lung inflammation revealed by high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) of H1N1 influenza virus infection in mice.",
        "Abstract": "Influenza is a significant health concern worldwide. Viral infection induces local and systemic activation of the immune system causing attendant changes in metabolism. High-resolution metabolomics (HRM) uses advanced mass spectrometry and computational methods to measure thousands of metabolites inclusive of most metabolic pathways. We used HRM to identify metabolic pathways and clusters of association related to inflammatory cytokines in lungs of mice with H1N1 influenza virus infection. Infected mice showed progressive weight loss, decreased lung function, and severe lung inflammation with elevated cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3] and increased oxidative stress via cysteine oxidation. HRM showed prominent effects of influenza virus infection on tryptophan and other amino acids, and widespread effects on pathways including purines, pyrimidines, fatty acids, and glycerophospholipids. A metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) of the aforementioned inflammatory cytokines was used to determine the relationship of metabolic responses to inflammation during infection. This cytokine-MWAS (cMWAS) showed that metabolic associations consisted of distinct and shared clusters of 396 metabolites highly correlated with inflammatory cytokines. Strong negative associations of selected glycosphingolipid, linoleate, and tryptophan metabolites with IFN-\u03b3 contrasted strong positive associations of glycosphingolipid and bile acid metabolites with IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-10. Anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 had strong positive associations with vitamin D, purine, and vitamin E metabolism. The detailed metabolic interactions with cytokines indicate that targeted metabolic interventions may be useful during life-threatening crises related to severe acute infection and inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "The growing volume of clinical data in modern medical practice creates difficulties for clinicians when attempting to come to a full understanding of each patient's overall health status. Many different approaches to computer-based visualizations have been taken in an attempt to alleviate this burden; however, no single approach has been widely adopted. As a step towards optimization and standardization of data visualization in healthcare, this paper presents a diverse set of approaches to visualization for multiple organ systems. To do so we summarize best practices in design and evaluation while proposing usability testing methodology. We then review and illustrate the goals of various clinical data visualization techniques.",

        "Title": "Adenovirus-mediated Foxp3 expression in lung epithelial cells reduces airway inflammation in ovalbumin and cockroach-induced asthma model.",
        "Abstract": "Foxp3 is a master regulator of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T-cell (Treg) function and is also a suppressor of SKP2 and HER2/ErbB2. There are an increasing number of reports describing the functions of Foxp3 in cell types other than Tregs. In this context, we evaluated the functions of Foxp3 in ovalbumin- and cockroach-induced asthma models. Foxp3-EGFP-expressing adenovirus or EGFP control adenovirus was administered intratracheally (i.t.), followed by challenge with ovalbumin (OVA) or cockroach extract to induce asthma. Th2 cytokine and immune cell profiles of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), as well as serum IgE levels, were analyzed. Histological analyses were also conducted to demonstrate the effects of Foxp3 expression on airway remodeling, goblet cell hyperplasia and inflammatory responses in the lung. Adenoviral Foxp3 was expressed only in lung epithelial cells, and not in CD4(+) or CD8(+) cells. BALF from Foxp3 gene-delivered mice showed significantly reduced numbers of total immune cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes in response to cockroach allergen or OVA. In addition, Foxp3 expression in the lung reduced the levels of Th2 cytokines and IgE in BALF and serum, respectively. Moreover, histopathological analysis also showed that Foxp3 expression substantially inhibited eosinophil infiltration into the airways, goblet cell hyperplasia and smooth muscle cell hypertrophy. Furthermore, when Tregs were depleted by diphtheria toxin in Foxp3(DTR) mice, the anti-asthmatic functions of Foxp3 were not altered in OVA-challenged asthma models. In this study, our results suggest that Foxp3 expression in lung epithelial cells, and not in Tregs, inhibited OVA- and cockroach extract-induced asthma.",

        "Abstract": "This commentary discusses causal estimands of same-age and same-grade comparisons for assessing grade-retention effects on student ability and performance. Using potential outcomes notation, we show that same-age and same-grade comparisons refer to different retention-promotion contrasts and therefore assess different causal questions. We also comment on deleting versus censoring records of students who dropped out of the study or do not belong to the treatment regimes under investigation. Whereas deleting entire student records potentially induces collider bias, censoring circumvents bias if censoring is ignorable given the observed pretreatment covariates.",

        "Abstract": "Pullulan/Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS)/Montmorillonite (MMT) hybrid nanofibers were electrospun from their aqueous solution using different Pullulan/COS mass ratios and variable amounts of MMT. The effects of Pullulan/COS mass ratios and MMT contents on the morphologies and properties of PulluIan/COS/MMT hybrid nanofibers were investigated. The obtained nanofibers were characterized with field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), and tensile strength measurement. The Pullulan/COS mass ratio and MMT contents significantly influence the morphologies and properties of the Pullulan/COS/MMT hybrid nanofibers. Higher Pullulan contents than COS contents forms uniform and bead free nanofibers. The addition of COS to Pullulan improves the thermal stability of Pullulan/COS blend nanofibers. The incorporation of MMT to the Pullulan/COS/MMT hybrid nanofibers increase their fiber diameter, improves their thermal stability and tensile strength. These morphological changes and property enhancement depend on the amount of MMT added. The XRD and TEM results suggest the coexistence of Pullulan, COS and MMT within polymer matrix through intercalation of polymer chain between silicate layers forming well-ordered multiplayer morphology with alternating polymeric and silicate layers.",

        "Abstract": "In our previous study, an early-maturing variety of rice (Oryza sativa L.), Jinbu can have feature with unique green color, various phytochemicals as well as nutritive components by the optimal early harvesting, called Green Rice(\u00ae) (GR). The aims of the present field experiments were to evaluate the changes in the weight of 1,000 kernels, yield, and contents of proximate and bioactive compounds in Chuchung, a mid-late maturing variety, during the pre-harvest maturation of rough rice and to research the appropriate harvest time and potent bioactivity of Chuchung GR. The weights of 1,000 kernels of Chuchung GR dramatically increased until 27 days after heading (DAH). The yields of Chuchung GR declined after 27 DAH and significantly declined to 0.0% after 45 DAH. The caloric value and total mineral contents were higher in the GR than in the full ripe stage, the brown rice (BR). In the GR, the contents of bioactive compounds, such as \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, \u03b3-oryzanol, and \u03b1-tocopherol, were much higher (P<0.05) than those in the BR, specifically during 24~27 DAH. Therefore, bioactive Chuchung GR can be produced with a reasonable yield at 24~27 DAH and it could be useful for applications in various nutritive and functional food products.",

        "Abstract": "Epidemiological and experimental evidence support health risks associated with the exposure to airborne particulate matter with a diameter of <10\u2009\u03bcM (PM10). PM10 stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory mediators. Thus, we assumed that natural antioxidants might provide health benefits attenuating hazardous effects of PM10. In the present study, we examined the effects of pomegranate peel extract (PPE) on THP-1 monocytic cells exposed to PM10. PM10 induced cytotoxicity and the production of ROS. It also increased the expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and cell adhesion molecules, such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). PPE at 10-100\u2009\u03bcg\u2009mL(-1) attenuated the production of ROS and the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, MCP-1, and ICAM-1, but not VCAM-1, in THP-1 cells stimulated by PM10 (100\u2009\u03bcg\u2009mL(-1)). PPE also attenuated the adhesion of PM10-stimulated THP-1 cells to EA.hy926 endothelial cells. PPE constituents, punicalagin and ellagic acid, attenuated PM10-induced monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, and punicalagin was less cytotoxic compared to ellagic acid. The present study suggests that PPE and punicalagin may be useful in alleviating inflammatory reactions due to particulate matter.",

        "Abstract": "How is object orientation represented in the brain? Behavioral error patterns reveal systematic tendencies to confuse certain orientations with one another. Using fMRI, we asked whether more confusable orientations are represented more similarly in object selective cortex (LOC). We compared two widely-used measures of neural similarity: multi-voxel pattern similarity (MVP-similarity) and Repetition Suppression. In LO, we found that multi-voxel pattern similarity was predicted by the confusability of two orientations. By contrast, Repetition Suppression effects in LO were unrelated to the confusability of orientations. To account for these differences between MVP-similarity and Repetition Suppression, we propose that MVP-similarity reflects the topographical distribution of neural populations, whereas Repetition Suppression depends on repeated activation of particular groups of neurons. This hypothesis leads to a unified interpretation of our results and may explain other dissociations between MVPA and Repetition Suppression observed in the literature.",

        "Title": "Ultra-early angiographic vasospasm associated with delayed cerebral ischemia and infarction following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE The clinical significance of cerebral ultra-early angiographic vasospasm (UEAV), defined as cerebral arterial narrowing within the first 48 hours of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), remains poorly characterized. The authors sought to determine its frequency, predictors, and impact on functional outcome. METHODS The authors prospectively studied UEAV in a cohort of 1286 consecutively admitted patients with aSAH between August 1996 and June 2013. Admission clinical, radiographic, and acute clinical course information was documented during patient hospitalization. Functional outcome was assessed at 3 months using the modified Rankin Scale. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were generated to assess predictors of UEAV and its relationship to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and outcome. Multiple imputation methods were used to address data lost to follow-up. RESULTS The cohort incidence rate of UEAV was 4.6%. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age, sentinel bleed, and poor admission clinical grade were significantly associated with UEAV. Patients with UEAV had a 2-fold increased risk of DCI (odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.9, p = 0.002) and cerebral infarction (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-3.9, p = 0.04), after adjusting for known predictors. Excluding patients who experienced sentinel bleeding did not change this effect. Patients with UEAV also had a significantly higher hazard for DCI in a multivariable model. UEAV was not found to be significantly associated with poor functional outcome (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.4-1.6, p = 0.5). CONCLUSIONS UEAV may be less frequent than has been reported previously. Patients who exhibit UEAV are at higher risk for refractory DCI that results in cerebral infarction. These patients may benefit from earlier monitoring for signs of DCI and more aggressive treatment. Further study is needed to determine the long-term functional significance of UEAV.",
