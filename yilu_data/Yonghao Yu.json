        "Abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a prevalent form of intermittent chronic pain, affecting approximately 7-10% of the global population. However, the current clinical administration methods, such as injection and oral administration, are mostly one-time administration, which cannot achieve accurate control of pain degree and drug dose. Herein, we developed near-infrared (NIR) light-responsive microneedle patches (MNPs) to spatiotemporally control the drug dose released to treat neuropathic pain according to the onset state. The mechanism of action utilizes upconversion nanoparticles to convert NIR light into visible and ultraviolet light. This conversion triggers the rapid rotation of the azobenzene molecular motor in the mesoporous material, enabling the on-demand controlled release of a drug dose. Additionally, MNs are used to overcome the barrier of the stratum corneum in a minimally invasive and painless manner, effectively promoting the transdermal penetration of drug molecules. The effectiveness of these patches has been demonstrated through significant results. Upon exposure to NIR light for five consecutive cycles, with each cycle lasting 30 s, the patches achieved a precise release of 318 \u03bcg of medication. In a mouse model, maximum pain relief was observed within 1 h of one cycle of NIR light exposure, with the effects lasting up to 6 h. The same level of precise treatment efficacy was maintained for subsequent pain episodes with similar light exposure. The NIR-controlled drugs precision-released MNPs provide a novel paradigm for the treatment of intermittent neuropathic pain.",

        "Abstract": "Diagnostic markers are desperately needed for the early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). We describe sets of markers expressed in temporal order in mouse models during pancreatitis, PDA initiation and progression. Cell type specificity and the differential expression of PDA markers were identified by screening single cell (sc) RNAseq from tumor samples of a mouse model for PDA (KIC) at early and late stages of PDA progression compared to that of a normal pancreas. Candidate genes were identified from three sources: (1) an unsupervised screening of the genes preferentially expressed in mouse PDA tumors; (2) signaling pathways that drive PDA, including the Ras pathway, calcium signaling, and known cancer genes, or genes encoding proteins that were identified by differential mass spectrometry (MS) of mouse tumors and conditioned media from human cancer cell lines; and (3) genes whose expression is associated with poor or better prognoses (PAAD, oncolnc.org). The developmental progression of PDA was detected in the temporal order of gene expression in the cancer cells of the KIC mice. The earliest diagnostic markers were expressed in epithelial cancer cells in early-stage, but not late-stage, PDA tumors. Other early markers were expressed in the epithelium of both early- and late-state PDA tumors. Markers that were expressed somewhat later were first elevated in the epithelial cancer cells of the late-stage tumors, then in both epithelial and mesenchymal cells, or only in mesenchymal cells. Stromal markers were differentially expressed in early- and/or late-stage PDA neoplasia in fibroblast and hematopoietic cells (lymphocytes and/or macrophages) or broadly expressed in cancer and many stromal cell types. Pancreatitis is a risk factor for PDA in humans. Mouse models of pancreatitis, including caerulein treatment and the acinar-specific homozygous deletion of differentiation transcription factors (dTFs), were screened for the early expression of all PDA markers identified in the KIC neoplasia. Prognostic markers associated with a more rapid decline were identified and showed differential and cell-type-specific expression in PDA, predominately in late-stage epithelial and/or mesenchymal cancer cells. Select markers were validated by immunohistochemistry in mouse and human samples of a normal pancreas and those with early- and late-stage PDA. In total, we present 2165 individual diagnostic and prognostic markers for disease progression to be tested in humans from pancreatitis to late-stage PDA.",

        "Abstract": "Alterations in zinc transporter expression in response to zinc loss protect cardiac cells from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms how cardiac cells sense zinc loss remains unclear. Here, we found that zinc deficiency induced ubiquitination and degradation of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3), which can alleviate myocardial I/R injury by activating STAT3 to promote the expression of ZIP family zinc transporter genes. The RING finger domain within PIAS3 is vital for PIAS3 degradation, as PIAS3-dRing (missing the RING domain) and PIAS3-Mut (zinc-binding site mutation) were resistant to degradation in the setting of zinc deficiency. Meanwhile, the RING finger domain within PIAS3 is critical for the inhibition of STAT3 activation. Moreover, PIAS3 knockdown increased cardiac Zn",

        "Abstract": "Intraoperative remifentanil administration has been linked to increased postoperative pain sensitivity. Recent studies have identified the involvement of euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2 (Ehmt2/G9a) in neuropathic pain associated with the transcriptional silencing of many potassium ion channel genes. This study investigates whether G9a regulates the potassium sodium-activated channel subfamily T member 1 (Slo2.2) in remifentanil-induced post-incisional hyperalgesia (RIH) in rodents. We performed remifentanil infusion (1\u202f\u03bcg\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1 for 60\u202fmin) followed by plantar incision to induce RIH in rodents. Our results showed that RIH was accompanied by increased G9a and H3K9me2 production and decreased Slo2.2 expression 48\u202fh postoperatively. Deletion of G9a rescued Slo2.2 expression in DRG and reduced RIH intensity. Slo2.2 overexpression also reversed this hyperalgesia phenotype. G9a overexpression decreased Slo2.2-mediated leak current and increased excitability in the small-diameter DRG neurons and laminal II small-diameter neurons in the spinal dorsal horn, which was implicated in peripheral and central sensitization. These results suggest that G9a contributes to the development of RIH by epigenetically silencing Slo2.2 in DRG neurons, leading to decreased central sensitization in the spinal cord. The findings may have implications for the development of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of postoperative pain.",

        "Abstract": "Sleep fragmentation (SF) is a common sleep problem experienced during the perioperative period by older adults, and is associated with postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Increasing evidence indicates that delta-wave activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is involved in sleep-dependent memory consolidation and that hippocampal theta oscillations are related to spatial exploratory memory. Recovery sleep (RS), a self-regulated state of sleep homeostasis, enhances delta-wave power and memory performance in sleep-deprived older mice. However, it remains unclear whether RS therapy has a positive effect on cognitive changes following SF in older mouse models. Therefore, this study aimed to explore whether preoperative RS can alleviate cognitive deficits in aged mice with SF. A model of preoperative 24-h SF combined with exploratory laparotomy-induced POCD was established in 18-month-old mice. Aged mice were treated with preoperative 6-h RS following SF and postoperative 6-h RS following surgery, respectively. The changes in hippocampus-dependent cognitive function were investigated using behavioral tests, electroencephalography (EEG), local field potential (LFP), magnetic resonance imaging, and neuromorphology. Mice that underwent 24-h SF combined with surgery exhibited severe spatial memory impairment; impaired cognitive performance could be alleviated by preoperative RS treatment. In addition, preoperative RS increased NREM sleep; enhanced EEG delta-wave activity and LFP theta oscillation in the hippocampal CA1; and improved hippocampal perfusion, microstructural integrity, and neuronal damage. Taken together, these results provide evidence that preoperative RS may ameliorate the severity of POCD aggravated by SF by enhancing delta slow-wave activity and hippocampal theta oscillation, and by ameliorating the reduction in regional cerebral blood flow and white matter microstructure integrity in the hippocampus.",

        "Title": "SfREPAT38, a pathogen response gene (REPAT), is involved in immune response of Spodoptera frugiperda larvae through mediating Toll signalling pathway.",
        "Abstract": "REPAT (response to pathogen) is an immune-associated gene family that plays important roles in insect immune response to pathogens. Although nine REPAT genes have been identified in Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) currently, their functions and mechanisms in the immune response to pathogens still remain unclear. Therefore, SfREPAT38, a pathogen response gene (REPAT) of S. frugiperda, was characterised and its function was analysed. The results showed that SfREPAT38 contains a signal peptide and a transcription activator MBF2 (multi-protein bridging factor 2) domain. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that SfREPAT38 was highly expressed in the sixth-instar larvae (L6) and was the highest in expression in the midgut of L6. We found that the expression of SfREPAT38 could be activated by challenge with four microbial pathogens (Bacillus thuringiensis, Metarhizium anisopliae, Spodoptera exigua nuclearpolyhedrosis and Escherichia coli), except 12\u2009h after E. coli infection. Furthermore, the SfREPAT38 expression levels significantly decreased at 24, 48 and 72\u2009h after SfREPAT38 dsRNA injection or feeding. Feeding with SfREPAT38 dsRNA significantly decreased the weight gain of S. frugiperda, and continuous feeding led to the death of S. frugiperda larvae from the fourth day. Moreover, SfREPAT38 dsRNA injection resulted in a significant decrease of weight gain on the fifth day. Silencing SfREPAT38 gene down-regulated the expression levels of immune genes belonging to the Toll pathway, including SPZ, Myd88, DIF, Cactus, Pell and Toll18W. After treatment with SfREPAT38 dsRNA, S. frugiperda became extremely sensitive to the B. thuringiensis infection, and the survival rate dramatically increased, with 100% mortality by the eighth day. The weight of S. frugiperda larvae was also significantly lower than that of the control groups from the second day onwards. In addition, the genes involved in the Toll signalling pathway and a few antibacterial peptide related genes were down-regulated after treatment. These results showed that SfREPAT38 is involved in the immune response of S. frugiperda larvae through mediating Toll signalling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Sepsis is a syndrome characterized by a systemic inflammatory response due to the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms. The relationship between Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), elastase, neutrophil expressed (ELANE) and sepsis remains unclear. The sepsis datasets GSE137340 and GSE154918 profiles were downloaded from gene expression omnibus generated from GPL10558. Batch normalization, differentially expressed Genes (DEGs) screening, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), functional enrichment analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), immune infiltration analysis, construction and analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) analysis were performed. Gene expression heatmaps were generated. TargetScan was used to screen miRNAs of DEGs. 328 DEGs were identified. According to Gene Ontology (GO), in the Biological Process analysis, they were mainly enriched in immune response, apoptosis, inflammatory response, and immune response regulation signaling pathways. In cellular component analysis, they were mainly enriched in vesicles, cytoplasmic vesicles, and secretory granules. In Molecular Function analysis, they were mainly concentrated in hemoglobin binding, Toll-like receptor binding, immunoglobulin binding, and RAGE receptor binding. In Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), they were mainly enriched in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, P53 signaling pathway, and legionellosis. Seventeen modules were generated. The PPI network identified 4 core genes (MPO, ELANE, CTSG, LCN2). Gene expression heatmaps revealed that core genes (MPO, ELANE, CTSG, LCN2) were highly expressed in sepsis samples. CTD analysis found that MPO, ELANE, CTSG and LCN2 were associated with sepsis, peritonitis, meningitis, pneumonia, infection, and inflammation. LCN2 and ELANE are highly expressed in sepsis and may serve as molecular targets.",

        "Abstract": "Following the highly successful Chinese American Society for Mass Spectrometry (CASMS) conferences in the previous 2\u2009years, the 3rd CASMS Conference was held virtually on August 28-31, 2023, using the Gather.Town platform to bring together scientists in the MS field. The conference offered a 4-day agenda with a scientific program consisting of two plenary lectures, and 14 parallel symposia in which a total of 70 speakers presented technological innovations and their applications in proteomics and biological MS and metabo-lipidomics and pharmaceutical MS. In addition, 16 invited speakers/panelists presented at two research-focused and three career development workshops. Moreover, 86 posters, 12 lightning talks, 3 sponsored workshops, and 11 exhibitions were presented, from which 9 poster awards and 2 lightning talk awards were selected. Furthermore, the conference featured four young investigator awardees to highlight early-career achievements in MS from our society. The conference provided a unique scientific platform for young scientists (i.e. graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty/investigators) to present their research, meet with prominent scientists, learn about career development, and job opportunities (http://casms.org).",

        "Abstract": "As a disease that has plagued human health for decades, sepsis has so far had no specific diagnostic or therapeutic indicators. The discovery of lactylation modifications not only uncovered the deep-rooted causes of changing between lactate level and pathophysiology and immunology of sepsis, but also reaffirmed the inevitable link between metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic reprogramming in sepsis. Lactylation modification became a potential marker for diagnosis and guiding the treatment of sepsis.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have pointed to PARP1 trapping as a key determinant of the anticancer effects of PARP1 inhibitors (PARPi). We identified RNF114, as a PARylation-dependent, E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in DNA damage response. Upon sensing genotoxicity, RNF114 was recruited, in a PAR-dependent manner, to DNA lesions, where it targeted PARP1 for degradation. The blockade of this pathway interfered with the removal of PARP1 from DNA lesions, leading to profound PARP1 trapping. We showed that a natural product, nimbolide, inhibited the E3 ligase activity of RNF114 and thus caused PARP1 trapping. However, unlike conventional PARPi, nimbolide treatment induced the trapping of both PARP1 and PARylation-dependent DNA repair factors. Nimbolide showed synthetic lethality with ",

        "Title": "Effects of the PI3K/Akt/HO-1 pathway on autophagy in a sepsis-induced acute lung injury mouse model.",
        "Abstract": "Sepsis-induced lung injury is an acute hypoxic respiratory insufficiency caused by systemic infectious factors that results in alveolar epithelial cell and capillary endothelial cell injury, diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema, and alveolar edema. Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 is usually associated with inflammation and has anti-inflammatory effects. Autophagy is a degradation pathway that eliminates cellular metabolic waste and plays an important protective role during stress. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/ protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway plays a key role in mediating cellular responses to inflammatory reactions. Therefore, we hypothesized that HO-1 is associated with autophagy and regulated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in mice with sepsis-induced lung injury. Sepsis-induced lung injury was induced in mice using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Hemin or Sn-protoporphyrin IX (SnPP) was administered via intraperitoneal injection before surgery. Survival rates were observed during days 1-7 after the surgery; lung histology was discerned 24\u00a0h after the surgery; pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors in plasma and lung tissue were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); HO-1, Beclin-1, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B)-II, p62 and lysosome associated membrane protein (LAMP)2 protein expression levels were measured 24\u00a0h after the surgery; HO-1 and LC3B-II protein expression levels were observed using immunofluorescence 24\u00a0h after the surgery; and autophagosomes were detected using electron microscopy 24\u00a0h after the surgery. Furthermore, when PI3K inhibitors LY294002, PI3K activators Recilisib and hemin were administered before the surgery, Akt, p-Akt, HO-1, and LC3-II levels were measured 24\u00a0h post-surgery. We found that HO-1 overexpression increased the survival rate and inhibited sepsis-induced lung injury. HO-1 overexpression attenuated the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10, HO-1) overexpression. Moreover, HO-1 overexpression was also associated with increased expression of Beclin-1, LC3B-II and LAMP2 protein expression; decreased p62 protein expression; and significantly increased autophagosome formation. The results for HO-1-downregulated mice contrasted with those mentioned above. LY294002 inhibited p-Akt/Akt, HO-1, and LC3B-II protein expression; and hemin reversed the inhibitory effect of LY294002. The protective effect of HO-1 was involved in the mediation of autophagy, which may be regulated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway during sepsis-induced lung injury in mice.",

        "Abstract": "Post-operative sleep disturbance is a common feature of elderly surgical patients, and sleep fragmentation (SF) is closely related to post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). SF is characterized by sleep interruption, increased number of awakenings and sleep structure destruction, similar to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Research shows that sleep interruption can change neurotransmitter metabolism and structural connectivity in sleep and cognitive brain regions, of which the medial septum and hippocampal CA1 are key brain regions connecting sleep and cognitive processes. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is a non-invasive method for the evaluation of neurometabolic abnormalities. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) realizes the observation of structural integrity and connectivity of brain regions of interest ",

        "Abstract": "Remimazolam tosilate (RT) is a new short-acting \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors agonist. However, its optimal use mode and dosage still remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the safety and effectiveness of the combination of RT and propofol in gastroscopy. This was a prospective, single-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study. All eligible 256 patients were randomized into the following 3 groups. Patients were anesthetized with propofol (Group P), RT (Group R) or the combination of RT and propofol (Group RP). The primary efficacy endpoints were: body movement score; satisfaction of gastroscopy doctors; success rate of sedation and effects on sleep status. Sedation induction time, time to be fully alert and adverse events were also recorded. The probability of complete immobility was lower in group R (33.73%) than in group P (86.67%) and RP (83.13%). The rate of doctors' satisfaction was much lower in group R (28.92%) than in group P (77.78%) and RP (72.29%). The success rate of sedation and sleep outcome score has no difference in the three groups. The time to adequate sedation was longer in group RP (77.27 \u00b1 18.63\u00a0s) than in group P (64.47 \u00b1 24.36\u00a0s), but much shorter than that in group R (102.84 \u00b1 46.43s). The time to be fully alert was shorter in group R (6.30 \u00b1 1.52\u00a0min) and RP (6.54 \u00b1 1.13\u00a0min) than in group P (7.87 \u00b1 1.08\u00a0min). The proportion of sedative hypotension was significantly higher in group P (41.11%) than in group R (1.20%) and group RP (3.61%) (",

        "Abstract": "Background: It is unknown whether early renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation strategy in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with both acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis with or without renal failure is clinically beneficial. Patients and methods: A total of 818 patients with both ARDS and sepsis admitted to the ICU of Tianjin Medical University General Hospital were included in the analysis. Early RRT was defined as initiating the RRT strategy within 24 h of admission. The relationship between early RRT and clinical outcomes, including primary (30-day mortality) and secondary (90-day mortality, serum creatinine, Pa o2 /Fi o2 , duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, cumulative fluid output, and cumulative fluid balance) outcomes, was compared using propensity score matching (PSM). Results: A total of 277 patients (33.9% of the total population) underwent an early RRT initiation strategy before PSM. After PSM, a cohort of 147 patients with early RRT and 147 patients without early RRT with matched baseline characteristics (including serum creatinine at admission) were constructed. Early RRT was not significantly associated with 30- (hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-1.85; P = 0.258) or 90-day mortality (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.91-1.87, P = 0.150). At each time point within 72 h after admission, there was no significant difference in serum creatinine, Pa o2 /Fi o2 and duration of mechanical ventilation between the early and the no early RRT groups. Early RRT significantly increased total output at all time points within 72 h of admission and reached a statistically significant negative fluid balance at 48 h. Conclusions: Early RRT initiation strategies had no statistically significant survival benefit in ICU patients with both ARDS and sepsis, with or without renal failure, nor did they significantly improve serum creatinine and oxygenation or shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation. The use and timing of RRT in such patients should be thoroughly investigated.",

        "Title": "Blocking SphK/S1P/S1PR1 axis signaling pathway alleviates remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia in rats.",
        "Abstract": "Recent research shows a correlation between altered sphingolipid metabolism and nociceptive processing. Activation of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 subtype (S1PR1) by its ligand, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), causes neuropathic pain. However, its role in remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia (RIH) has not been investigated. The purpose of this research was to establish if the SphK/S1P/S1PR1 axis mediated remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia and identify its potential targets. This study examined the protein expression of ceramide, sphingosine kinases (SphK), S1P, and S1PR1 in the spinal cord of rats treated with remifentanil (1.0\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/min for 60\u00a0min). Prior to receiving remifentanil, rats were injected with SK-1 (a SphK inhibitor); LT1002 (a S1P monoclonal antibody); CYM-5442, FTY720, and TASP0277308\uff08the S1PR1 antagonists); CYM-5478 (a S1PR2 agonist); CAY10444 (a S1PR3 antagonist); Ac-YVAD-CMK (a caspase-1 antagonist); MCC950 (the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome antagonist); and N-tert-Butyl-\u03b1-phenylnitrone (PBN, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger). Mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia were evaluated at baseline (24\u00a0h prior to remifentanil infusion) and 2, 6, 12, and 24\u00a0h following remifentanil administration. The expression of the NLRP3-related protein (NLRP3, caspase-1), pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1\u03b2(IL-1\u03b2), IL-18), and ROS was found in the spinal dorsal horns. In the meantime, immunofluorescence was used to ascertain if S1PR1 co-localizes with astrocytes. Remifentanil infusion induced considerable hyperalgesia in addition to increased ceramide, SphK, S1P, and S1PR1, NLRP3-related protein (NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18) and ROS expression, and S1PR1 localized astrocytes. By blocking the SphK/S1P/S1PR1 axis, remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia was reduced, as was the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-18) and ROS in the spinal cord. In addition, we observed that suppressing NLRP3 or ROS signal attenuated the mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia induced by remifentanil. Our findings indicate that the SphK/SIP/S1PR1 axis regulates the expression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 and ROS in the spinal dorsal horn to mediate remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia. These findings may contribute to pain and SphK/S1P/S1PR1 axis research positively, and inform the future study of this commonly used analgesic.",

        "Title": "PARP1 inhibitors induce pyroptosis via caspase 3-mediated gasdermin E cleavage.",
        "Abstract": "The identification of PARP1 as a therapeutic target for BRCA1/2-deficient cells has led to a paradigm shift for the treatment of human malignancies with BRCA1/2 mutations. However, our understanding of the mechanism of action of PARP1 inhibitors (PARPi) is still evolving. It is being increasingly appreciated that the immunomodulatory function of PARPi is a critical contributor of the anti-tumor effects of these compounds. Here, we identify a novel cell death effector pathway for PARPi where PARPi induces inflammatory pyroptosis that is mediated by caspase 3-dependent cleavage of GSDME. Caspase 3 is activated upon PARPi treatment which directly cleaves GSDME and, subsequently induces pyroptosis. Genetic and pharmacological experiments show that the presence of the PARP1 protein with uncompromised DNA binding capability is required for PARPi-induced pyroptosis, suggesting that PARP1 trapping is a key driver of this phenomenon. Importantly, we show that PARPi-induced GSDME cleavage and pyroptosis occurred only in the BRCA1-deficient cells, but not in those reconstituted with BRCA1 wild-type (WT). These findings suggest that pyroptosis could be a novel aspect of the immunomodulatory function of PARPi. Our studies could also offer new insights to the potential biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to achieve better anti-tumor effects of PARPi for BRCA-deficient tumors with low GSDME expression.",

        "Abstract": "Purpose: Postoperative delirium is a state of acute brain dysfunction characterized by fluctuating mental status that affects millions of patients each year. We used prophylactic inhalation of hydrogen gas in elderly patients undergoing elective surgery to compare their occurrence of postoperative delirium with that of controls. Methods: A total of 184 patients aged \u2265 65 years were enrolled and randomized into either a control group or a hydrogen inhalation group. The quality of sleep was assessed 1 day before and 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery at 8 A.M. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) was used as a screening tool for delirium and assessed the patients\u2019 state of consciousness 1\u22127 days after surgery. Results: Postoperative delirium occurred in 17 (24%) of 70 patients without hydrogen inhalation and in 10 (12%) of 83 patients after hydrogen inhalation. The incidence of delirium was decreased in the hydrogen group. No significant differences were found between length of stay in hospital after surgery and sleep quality at 1, 3, and 7 days postoperatively between the two groups. The numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores were higher in the hydrogen group (4.08 \u00b1 1.77) than the control group (3.54 \u00b1 1.77) on day 1 (p < 0.05); however, the mean difference between the two groups was small (1 to 1.6). There were no significant differences on day 3 and 7. The postoperative C-reactive protein level was significantly lower in the hydrogen group than the control group. Conclusions: This study suggests that hydrogen inhalation can prevent postoperative delirium in elderly noncardiac patients by reducing the inflammatory response.",

        "Abstract": "Elderly patients are susceptible to postoperative infections with increased mortality. Analyzing with a deep learning model, the perioperative factors that could predict and/or contribute to postoperative infections may improve the outcome in elderly. This was an observational cohort study with 2014 elderly patients who had elective surgery from 28 hospitals in China from April to June 2014. We aimed to develop and validate deep learning-based predictive models for postoperative infections in the elderly. 1510 patients were randomly assigned to be training dataset for establishing deep learning-based models, and 504 patients were used to validate the effectiveness of these models. The conventional model predicted postoperative infections was 0.728 (95% CI 0.688-0.768) with the sensitivity of 66.2% (95% CI 58.2-73.6) and specificity of 66.8% (95% CI 64.6-68.9). The deep learning model including risk factors relevant to baseline clinical characteristics predicted postoperative infections was 0.641 (95% CI 0.545-0.737), and sensitivity and specificity were 34.2% (95% CI 19.6-51.4) and 88.8% (95% CI 85.6-91.6), respectively. Including risk factors relevant to baseline variables and surgery, the deep learning model predicted postoperative infections was 0.763 (95% CI 0.681-0.844) with the sensitivity of 63.2% (95% CI 46-78.2) and specificity of 80.5% (95% CI 76.6-84). Our feasibility study indicated that a deep learning model including risk factors for the prediction of postoperative infections can be achieved in elderly. Further study is needed to assess whether this model can be used to guide clinical practice to improve surgical outcomes in elderly.",

        "Abstract": "Sevoflurane is the most commonly used general anesthetic in pediatric surgery, but it has the potential to be neurotoxic. Previous research found that long-term or multiple sevoflurane exposures could cause cognitive deficits in newborn mice but not adult mice, whereas short-term or single inhalations had little effect on cognitive function at both ages. The mechanisms behind these effects, however, are unclear.",

        "Abstract": "PARylation plays critical role in regulating multiple cellular processes such as DNA damage response and repair, transcription, RNA processing, and stress response. More than 300 human proteins have been found to be modified by PARylation on acidic residues, that is, Asp (D) and Glu (E). We used the deep-learning tool AlphaFold to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and their interfaces for these proteins based on coevolution signals from joint multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). AlphaFold predicted 260 confident PPIs involving PARylated proteins, and about one quarter of these PPIs have D/E-PARylation sites in their predicted PPI interfaces. AlphaFold predictions offer novel insights into the mechanisms of PARylation regulations by providing structural details of the PPI interfaces. D/E-PARylation sites have a preference to occur in coil regions and disordered regions, and PPI interfaces containing D/E-PARylation sites tend to occur between short linear sequence motifs in disordered regions and globular domains. The hub protein PCNA is predicted to interact with more than 20 proteins via the common PIP box motif and the structurally variable flanking regions. D/E-PARylation sites were found in the interfaces of key components of the RNA transcription and export complex, the SF3a spliceosome complex, and H/ACA and C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complexes, suggesting that systematic PARylation have a profound effect in regulating multiple RNA-related processes such as RNA nuclear export, splicing, and modification. Finally, PARylation of SUMO2 could modulate its interaction with CHAF1A, thereby representing a potential mechanism for the cross-talk between PARylation and SUMOylation in regulation of chromatin remodeling.",

RNA methylation, a common epigenetic modification, plays an important role in disease progression. However, little is known about the role of RNA methylation modification in the regulation of IS. The aim of this study was to investigate RNA methylation modification patterns and immune infiltration characteristics in IS through bioinformatics analysis. We downloaded gene expression profiles of control and IS model rat brain tissues from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. IS profiles were divided into two subtypes based on RNA methylation regulators, and functional enrichment analyses were conducted to determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the subtypes. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to explore co-expression modules and genes based on DEGs. The IS clinical diagnosis model was successfully constructed and four IS characteristic genes (",

        "Abstract": "Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a cognitive impairment caused by sepsis, associated with increased morbidity and death. And acetaminophen (APAP) is a promising therapeutic medicine for SAE treatment. This research was designed to determine whether APAP alleviates SAE by attenuating ferroptosis and mediating the glutathione peroxidase (GPX4) pathway. The cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) approach was used to establish septic mouse models. The survival rates for 7\u00a0days were determined. The Morris water maze (MWM) was utilized to assess cognitive function. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining identified histopathologic alterations in hippocampal tissue. Mitochondrial damage was discovered in hippocampal tissue using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The reactive oxygen (ROS) levels in hippocampal tissue were measured using commercial assays. Septic cell models were produced using HT22 cells grown with 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ROS were quantified using immunofluorescence. Ferroptosis-related protein expression levels in hippocampal tissue and HT22 cells were measured using western blotting. To evaluate the iron content of hippocampal tissue and HT22 cells, commercial kits were employed. According to the findings, APAP improved survival rates, lowered hippocampal and mitochondrial damage, and improve cognitive impairment. In both animal and cell studies, APAP reduced iron content, ROS, glutamate antiporter (xCT), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) levels but increased GPX4 expression. However, RSL3, a GPX4 inhibitor that acts as a ferroptosis activator, decreased the protective properties of APAP ",

        "Title": "Exploring built environment factors on e-bike travel behavior in urban China: A case study of Jinan.",
        "Abstract": "E-bike, characterized as a low-carbon and health-beneficial active travel mode, is gradually becoming popular in China. Although built environment factors are considered to be key parameters that can facilitate or hinder active transportation, such as cycling or walking, few studies have explored the impact of built environment on e-bikes. To fill this gap, this study was the first to explore the relationship between e-bike usage and built environment factors based on population level travel survey in central Jinan, China. Both macro and micro levels of built environment were measured using multi-source data. We employed ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models to explore the aggregation patterns of e-bike trips. Besides, the local Moran's I was employed to classify the aggregation patterns of e-bike trips into four types. The results from OLS model showed that eye-level greenery, building floor area, road density and public service POI were positive significantly related to e-bike trips, while open sky index and NDVI had negative association with e-bike trips. The usage of GWR model provided more subtle results, which revealed significant spatial heterogeneity on the impacts of different built environment parameters. Road density and public service POI posed positive effects on e-bike travel while NDVI and open sky index were found mainly pose negative impacts on e-bike travel. Moreover, we found similar coefficient distribution patterns of eye-level greenery, building floor area and distance to bus stop. Therefore, tailored planning interventions and policies can be developed to facilitate e-bike travel and promote individual's health level.",

        "Abstract": "General anesthesia has been widely utilized since the 1840s, but its underlying neural circuits remain to be completely understood. Since both general anesthesia and sleep are reversible losses of consciousness, studies on the neural-circuit mechanisms affected by general anesthesia have mainly focused on the neural nuclei or the pathways known to regulate sleep. Three advanced technologies commonly used in neuroscience, in vivo calcium imaging, chemogenetics, and optogenetics, are used to record and modulate the activity of specific neurons or neural circuits in the brain areas of interest. Recently, they have successfully been used to study the neural nuclei and pathways of general anesthesia. This article reviews these three techniques and their applications in the brain nuclei or pathways affected by general anesthesia, to serve as a reference for further and more accurate exploration of other neural circuits under general anesthesia and to contribute to other research fields in the future.",

Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) may play a protective role in neuronal activity and injury repair, whereas its toxic fragments are reported to induce neurodegeneration and neurocognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, we set out to test the hypothesis that the difference in ApoE fragments, but not the full-length ApoE, contributes to the difference in Tau phosphorylation and neurocognitive functions following sevoflurane anesthesia in young mice.",

        "Abstract": "Although the biological relationship between vitamin D (VD) deficiency and cognitive function has been recognized by many scholars, the theoretical mechanisms involved are still not well-understood. In this study, we demonstrated the role of VD in alleviating the cognitive dysfunction in aged mice caused by sevoflurane anesthesia. Forty female C57BL/6 mice aged 12 months were selected for the experiment. VD (-) and VD (+) mouse models and sevoflurane anesthesia models were established. Mice were randomly divided into normal elderly group (NC group), normal aged mice + sevoflurane anesthesia treatment group (NS group), aged VD (-) mice + sevoflurane anesthesia treatment group [VD (-) group], and aged VD (+) + sevoflurane anesthesia treatment group [VD (+) group]. To compare the emergence time after sevoflurane anesthesia in aged mice with different levels of VD and to test the cognitive function of four groups through the water maze. Inflammatory factor expression and cholinergic activity in hippocampus tissue of all mice were measured at the end of behavioral tests. These data show that, low levels of VD aggravated the delayed emergence and cognitive dysfunction in aged mice caused by sevoflurane anesthesia, while higher levels of VD mitigated this impairment by enhancing cholinergic activity and reducing inflammatory factor expression in the hippocampus.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic pain after bone fracture and orthopedic surgery is often refractory to most analgesics currently in use, thus emphasizing the urgent need for improved therapeutic medications. Chemokine-dependent neuroinflammation is critical for excitatory synaptic plasticity and central nociception sensitization. Recent studies have focused on the inhibition of inflammatory responses by artesunate, the first anti-malaria drug extracted from artemisinin. The present study investigated the analgesic effects and potential targets of artesunate in a mouse model of chronic pain induced by tibial fracture and orthopedic surgery. Three injections of artesunate were intrathecally administered on a daily basis from days 4 to 6 after fracture. We reported that repetitive exposure to artesunate (10 and 100\u00a0\u03bcg but not 1\u00a0\u03bcg) dose-dependently prevented fracture-induced mechanical and cold allodynia. Moreover, single intrathecal injection of artesunate (100\u00a0\u03bcg) alleviated the established chronic pain on day 14 after fracture surgery. Intraperitoneal artesunate (10 and 50\u00a0mg\u00a0kg",

        "Title": "Artesunate Alleviates Paclitaxel-Induced Neuropathic Pain in Mice by Decreasing Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5 Activity and Neuroinflammation in Primary Sensory Neurons.",
        "Abstract": "Experimental studies on the pathogenetic process of paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain (PINP) have been initially carried out, but PINP still has no effective therapy. Recently reported studies have highlighted the involvement of glutamate receptors and neuroinflammation in peripheral and central nociceptive transmission in PINP. Artesunate is a first-line antimalarial drug with established efficacy in alleviating pain in a variety of pathologies. The current work assessed whether artesunate inhibits PINP by modulating metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and neuroinflammation in mice. The anti-hyperalgesic effect of artesunate was verified by assessing mechanical frequency and thermal latency in the paw withdrawal test as well as spontaneous pain. The expression levels of mGluR5, pain-related receptors and neuroinflammatory markers in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) were examined. In addition, treatment with CHPG and 2-methyl-6-(phenyl ethynyl) pyridine (MPEP) (mGluR5 agonist and antagonist, respectively) was performed to determine mGluR5's role in the anti-hyperalgesic properties of artesunate. We demonstrated artesunate prevented PINP in a dose-dependent manner, while exerting a clear anti-hyperalgesic effect on already existing PINP. Artesunate normalized paclitaxel-related expression changes in DRG mGluR5, NR1, and GluA2, as well as six paclitaxel related neuroinflammation markers. Intrathecal application of MPEP treated PINP by reversing NR1 and GluA2 expression changes but had no effects on chemokines and inflammatory factors. Furthermore, artesunate treatment reversed acute pain following CHPG application. In conclusion, this study revealed that artesunate alleviates paclitaxel-induced hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain by decreasing DRG mGluR5 expression and neuroinflammation in the mouse model of PINP.",

        "Abstract": "Ciprofol is a propofol analogue with improved pharmacokinetic properties. A multi-centre, non-inferiority trial was conducted to compare the deep sedation properties of ciprofol and propofol with a non-inferiority margin of 8% in patients undergoing gastroscopy and colonoscopy. In total, 289 patients were randomly allocated for surgery (259 colonoscopy and 30 gastroscopy) at a 1:1 ratio to be given intravenous injections of ciprofol (0.4\u00a0mg/kg) or propofol (1.5\u00a0mg/kg). The primary outcome was the success rate of colonoscopy defined as colonoscopy completion with no need for an alternative sedative or >5 ciprofol or propofol top up doses within any 15-min time period. The success rate of colonoscopy was 100% in the ciprofol group vs. 99.2% in the propofol group (mean difference 0.8%, 95% CI: -2.2% to 4.2%). Except for the gastrointestinal lesions found during the gastroscopy and colonoscopy procedures, the occurrence rates of adverse drug reactions in the ciprofol and propofol groups were 31.3% and 62.8%, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Pain on injection was less common in the ciprofol group (4.9% vs. 52.4%, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The outcomes demonstrated that ciprofol was non-inferior to propofol with regard to successful sedation for gastroscopy or colonoscopy procedures and no obvious important adverse events occurred.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic pain is a common, complex and unpleasant sensation following nerve injury, tissue trauma, inflammatory diseases, infection and cancer. It affects up to 25% of adults and is increasingly recognized as the leading cause of distress, disability and disease burden globally. Chronic pain is often refractory to most current analgesics, thus emphasizing the requirement for improved therapeutic medications. It is of great importance to elucidate the specific pathogenesis of chronic pain with different etiologies. Recent progress has advanced our understanding in the contribution of neuroinflammation and glial cells (microglia and astrocyte) activation in the plasticity of excitatory nociceptive synapses and the development of chronic pain phenotypes. Oxidative stress-associated neuronal apoptosis is also identified to be a pivotal step for central pain sensitization. The family of cysteine aspartate specific proteases (Caspases) has been well known to be key signaling molecules for inflammation and apoptosis in several neurological conditions. Recent studies have highlighted the unconventional and emerging role of caspases in microgliosis, astrocytes morphogenesis, chemokines release, cytokines secretion and neuronal apoptosis in initiating and maintaining synaptogenesis, synaptic strength and signal transduction in persistent pain hypersensitivity, suggesting the possibility of targeting caspases pathway for prevention and treatment of chronic pain. In this review, we will discuss and summarize the advances in the distinctive properties of caspases family in the pathophysiology of chronic pain, especially in neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, cancer pain and musculoskeletal pain, with the aim to find the promising therapeutic candidates for the resolution of chronic pain to better manage patients undergoing chronic pain in clinics.",

Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) may play a protective role in neuronal activity and injury repair, whereas its 18-kDa fragments are reported to induce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease patients. We aimed to test the hypothesis that differences in 18-kDa ApoE fragment levels, but not full-length ApoE, in primary neurons contribute to differences in tau phosphorylation and neuroinflammation with or without sevoflurane administration. Neurons extracted from wild-type (WT), ApoE knockout (ApoE-KO), and ApoE \u03b53-and \u03b52-targeted replacement (ApoE \u03b53, ApoE \u03b52) mice were divided into control and sevoflurane groups.

        "Abstract": "The evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase mTORC1 is a central regulator of cell growth and proliferation. mTORC1 is activated on the lysosome surface. However, once mTORC1 is activated, it is unclear whether mTORC1 phosphorylates local lysosomal proteins to regulate specific aspects of lysosomal biology. Through cross-reference analyses of the lysosome proteome with the mTORC1-regulated phosphoproteome, we identify STK11IP as a lysosome-specific substrate of mTORC1. mTORC1 phosphorylates STK11IP at Ser",

Activation of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been linked to the development of inflammatory and neuropathic pain.

Here, using unbiased protein affinity purification, we show that truncated PARP1 (tPARP1) recognizes the RNA polymerase III (Pol III) complex in the cytosol. tPARP1 mono-ADP-ribosylates RNA Pol III in vitro and mediates ADP-ribosylation of RNA Pol III during poly(dA-dT)-stimulated apoptosis in cells. tPARP1-mediated activation of RNA Pol III facilitates IFN-\u03b2 production and apoptosis. In contrast, suppression of PARP1 or expressing the non-cleavable form of PARP1 impairs these molecular events. Taken together, these studies reveal a novel biological role of tPARP1 during cytosolic DNA-induced apoptosis.",

        "Abstract": "Although targeted MAPK pathway inhibition has achieved remarkable patient responses in many cancers, the development of resistance has remained a critical challenge. Adaptive tumor response underlies the drug resistance. Furthermore, such bypass mechanisms often lead to the activation of many pro-survival kinases, which complicates the rational design of combination therapies. Here, we performed global tyrosine phosphoproteomic (pTyr) analyses and demonstrated that targeted MAPK signaling inhibition in melanoma leads to a profound remodeling of the pTyr proteome. Intriguingly, altered cholesterol metabolism might drive, in a coordinated fashion, the activation of these kinases. Indeed, we found an accumulation of intracellular cholesterol in melanoma cells (with BRAF",

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) phosphorylation in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) plays a pronociceptive role in neuropathic pain. The contribution of the P2Y1 purinergic receptor (P2Y1R) in DRG to pain hypersensitivity derived from various origins and P2Y1R upregulation-induced NMDAR activation in neurons have also been uncovered. This study aimed to investigate whether P2Y1R participates in nociceptive processing in the DRG and spinal cord in remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia.",

Brain-derived extracellular vesicles (BDEVs) have been reported to cause a hypercoagulable state that can rapidly develop into consumptive coagulopathy, which is consistent with the pathophysiological process of sepsis-induced coagulopathy.

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Perioperative neuro-cognitive disorders (PND) are preoperative and postoperative complications of multiple nervous systems, typically manifested as decreased memory and learning ability after surgery. It was used to replace the original definition of postoperative cognitive dysfunctions (POCD) from 2018. Our previous studies have shown that sevoflurane inhalation can lead to cognitive dysfunction in Sprague-Dawley rats, but the specific mechanism is still unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (n=6): the SD group was given 24-h acute sleep deprivation; Sevoflurane was inhaled for 2 h in the Sevo group. Two mL propofol was injected into the tail vein of rats in the Prop group. The rats in the SD+Sevo group and SD+Prop group were deprived of sleep before intervention in the same way as before. RESULTS We noted significant behavioral changes in rats treated with SIK3 inhibitors or tau phosphorylation agonists before propofol injection or sevoflurane inhalation, with associated protein levels and dendritic spine density documented. Sevoflurane anesthesia-induced cognitive impairment following acute sleep deprivation was more pronounced than sleep deprivation-induced cognitive impairment alone and resulted in increased brain SIK3 levels, increased phosphorylation of total tau and tau, and decreased acetylation modifications. After using propofol, the cognitive function returned to baseline levels with a series of reversals of cognitive dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that sevoflurane inhalation via the SIK3 pathway aggravates cognitive impairment after acute sleep deprivation and that propofol anesthesia reverses the effects of sleep deprivation by affecting modifications of tau protein.",

        "Abstract": "Multiple organ failure (MOF) is the main cause of early death in septic shock. Lungs are among the organs that are affected in MOF, resulting in acute lung injury. Inflammation is an important factor that causes immune cell dysfunction in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Autophagy is involved in the process of inflammation and also occurs in response to cell and tissue injury in several diseases. We previously demonstrated that hydrogen alleviated the inflammation-induced cell injury and organ damage in septic mice.",

        "Abstract": "Patients who undergo surgery of femur fracture suffer the excruciating pain. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a unique \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist with sedative and analgesic properties, whose efficacy and safety are still unclear for surgery of femur fracture. Randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of addition of DEX to general or local anesthesia in surgery of femur fracture were searched from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library database. Patients who received DEX infusion had a significant longer time to rescue analgesia compared with those without DEX coadministration. DEX treatment seemed to reduce the visual analog score; however, the significance did not reach any statistical difference. DEX as an analgesic adjuvant did not reduce the onset of sensory block time, shorten the time to achieve maximum sensory block level, and provide a longer duration of sensory block. The difference in mean sedation scores between 2 groups was not statistically significant. As for adverse effects, DEX therapy significantly increased the rate of hypotension. In conclusion, dexmedetomidine as a local anesthetic adjuvant in femur fracture surgery had a longer duration of rescue analgesia. However, the incidence of hypotension was markedly increased in these patients. It was worth noting that the evidence was of low to moderate quality.",

N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation and upregulation of transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) membrane trafficking in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) are critical to cold hyperalgesia derived from neuropathic pain, and TRPM8 activation causes NMDAR-dependent cold response. Contribution of P2Y1 purinergic receptor (P2Y1R) activation in DRG to cold pain hypersensitivity and NMDAR activation induced by P2Y1R upregulation in neurons are also unraveled.

        "Abstract": "Neuropathic pain (NP) is chronic, intractable, and typically not alleviated using analgesics. Ferroptosis is a new type of cell death characterized by mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, affecting specific types of synaptic plasticity in the spinal cord. Here, we evaluated the role of ferroptosis in NP using chronic contractile injury (CCI) in rats. The CCI and control groups were subjected to sciatic nerve ligation. The mechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal withdrawal reflex latency were used to detect changes in mechanical pain threshold and thermal pain threshold in rats, respectively. Notably, CCI caused mechanical and thermal stimulation of the injured hind paw, reduced levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and increased acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4). Treatment with the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (10\u00a0mg/kg) 1\u00a0h after surgery upregulated GPX4 expression and downregulated ACSL4 expression, whereas the ferroptosis inducer, erastin (10\u00a0mg/kg), exerted opposite effects. Treatment with ferrostatin-1 upregulated NeuN expression and downregulated GPX4 expression, whereas erastin reversed these effects. CCI increased the number of damaged mitochondria and decreased the mean planar mitochondrial area, and treatment with erastin further exacerbated these effects. The iron ion content in the spinal cords of CCI-induced rats increased. Treatment with ferrostatin-1 decreased, whereas treatment with erastin increased iron ion content in the CCI-induced rat model. Taken together, our results showed that ferroptosis is involved in the development of NP in male rats by blocking neuron and astrocyte activation in the spinal dorsal horn.",

        "Abstract": "Remifentanil is widely used to control intraoperative pain. However, its analgesic effect is limited by the generation of postoperative hyperalgesia. In this study, we investigated whether the impairment of transmembrane protein 16C (TMEM16C)/Slack is required for \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic receptor (AMPAR) activation in remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia. Remifentanil anesthesia reduced the paw withdrawal threshold from 2 h to 48 h postoperatively, with a decrease in the expression of TMEM16C and Slack in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord. Knockdown of TMEM16C in the DRG reduced the expression of Slack and elevated the basal peripheral sensitivity and AMPAR expression and function. Overexpression of TMEM16C in the DRG impaired remifentanil-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and behavioral hyperalgesia. AMPAR-mediated current and neuronal excitability were downregulated by TMEM16C overexpression in the spinal cord. Taken together, these findings suggest that TMEM16C/Slack regulation of excitatory synaptic plasticity via GluA1-containing AMPARs is critical in the pathogenesis of remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia in rats.",

        "Title": "Hydrogen enriched saline alleviates morphine tolerance via inhibiting neuroinflammation, GLT-1, GS nitration and NMDA receptor trafficking and functioning in the spinal cord of rats.",
        "Abstract": "The development and maintenance of morphine tolerance showed association with neuroinflammation and dysfunction of central glutamatergic system (such as nitration of glutamate transporter). Recent evidence indicated that hydrogen could reduce the levels of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, but its role in morphine tolerance has not been studied. The rats were intrathecally administered with morphine (10\u2009\u03bcg/10\u2009\u03bcL each time, twice/day for 5 days). Hydrogen enriched saline (HS) or saline was given intraperitoneally at 1, 3 and 10\u2009mL/kg for 10\u2009min before each dose of morphine administration. The tail-flick latency, mechanical threshold and thermal latency were assessed one day (baseline) before and daily for up to 5 days during morphine injection. The pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6)] (by western blotting), astrocyte activation (by immunofluorescence and western blotting), and nitration of glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) and glutamine synthetase (GS) (by immunoprecipitation), membrane and total expression of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor NR1 and NR2B subunits were carried out in the spinal dorsal horns. Chronic morphine administration induced antinociceptive tolerance, and together led to increased TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 expression, astrocyte activation, GLT-1 and GS nitration, increased membrane and total NR1, NR2B expression. Injection of HS attenuated morphine tolerance in a dose-dependent manner, decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression, inhibited astrocyte activation, decreased GLT-1 and GS nitration, and inhibited membrane trafficking of NMDA receptor. Our result showed that hydrogen pretreatment prevented morphine tolerance by reducing neuroinflammation, GLT-1, GS nitration, NMDA receptor trafficking in the spinal dorsal horn. Pretreatment with hydrogen might be considered as a novel therapeutic strategy for the prevention of morphine tolerance.",

        "Abstract": "Prolonged postoperative pain is a major concern and occurs more frequently in women, but mechanisms remain elusive. NR2B-containging N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is a key component of nociception transduction. Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1)-mediated iron overload involves NMDA-induced neurotoxicity in males. Kalirin-7 is vital in synaptic plasticity underlying pathological pain in males. Herein, the requirement for kalirin-7 in NR2B phosphorylation-dependent iron accumulation and spine plasticity in postoperative pain after tibial fracture in female mice has been examined.",

        "Title": "mTORC1 promotes TOP mRNA translation through site-specific phosphorylation of LARP1.",
        "Abstract": "LARP1 is a key repressor of TOP mRNA translation. It binds the m7Gppp cap moiety and the adjacent 5'TOP motif of TOP mRNAs, thus impeding the assembly of the eIF4F complex on these transcripts. mTORC1 controls TOP mRNA translation via LARP1, but the details of the mechanism are unclear. Herein we elucidate the mechanism by which mTORC1 controls LARP1's translation repression activity. We demonstrate that mTORC1 phosphorylates LARP1 in vitro and in vivo, activities that are efficiently inhibited by rapamycin and torin1. We uncover 26 rapamycin-sensitive phospho-serine and -threonine residues on LARP1 that are distributed in 7 clusters. Our data show that phosphorylation of a cluster of residues located proximally to the m7Gppp cap-binding DM15 region is particularly sensitive to rapamycin and regulates both the RNA-binding and the translation inhibitory activities of LARP1. Our results unravel a new model of translation control in which the La module (LaMod) and DM15 region of LARP1, both of which can directly interact with TOP mRNA, are differentially regulated: the LaMod remains constitutively bound to PABP (irrespective of the activation status of mTORC1), while the C-terminal DM15 'pendular hook' engages the TOP mRNA 5'-end to repress translation, but only in conditions of mTORC1 inhibition.",

        "Abstract": "Isoflurane contributes to cognitive deficits when used as a general anesthetic, and so does sleep deprivation (SD). Patients usually suffer from insomnia before an operation due to anxiety, fear, and other factors. It remains unclear whether preoperative SD exacerbates cognitive impairment induced by isoflurane. In this study, we observed the effects of pretreated 24-h SD in adult isoflurane-exposed mice on the cognitive behaviors, the Ca",

        "Abstract": "Optimal DNA damage response is associated with ADP-ribosylation of histones. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of DNA damage-induced histone ADP-ribosylation remains elusive. Herein, using unbiased mass spectrometry, we identify that glutamate residue 141 (E141) of variant histone H2AX is ADP-ribosylated following oxidative DNA damage. In-depth studies performed with wild-type H2AX and the ADP-ribosylation-deficient E141A mutant suggest that H2AX ADP-ribosylation plays a critical role in base excision repair (BER). Mechanistically, ADP-ribosylation on E141 mediates the recruitment of Neil3 glycosylase to the sites of DNA damage for BER. Moreover, loss of this ADP-ribosylation enhances serine-139 phosphorylation of H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) upon oxidative DNA damage and erroneously causes the accumulation of DNA double-strand break (DSB) response factors. Taken together, these results reveal that H2AX ADP-ribosylation not only facilitates BER repair, but also suppresses the \u03b3H2AX-mediated DSB response.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remimazolam tosylate versus propofol in patients undergoing colonoscopy. In this multicentered, blinded, randomized, active-controlled, non-inferior phase III trial, 384 eligible patients who were about to undergo colonoscopy were randomized as a ratio of 1:1 into remimazolam and propofol group. Procedure success was assessed and defined as the completion of colonoscopy without administration of rescue sedative agent or more than 5 top-ups of trial drug in any 15 minute-period after initial administration of trial drug. Sedation quality was evaluated by Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score. Treatment-emergent adverse events were recorded. Procedure success rate was 96.91% (188/194) in remimazolam group and 100% (190/190) in propofol group, and the difference in rate was -3.09% with 95% confidence interval (CI) of -5.53%~-0.66%. Since the lower limit of 95% CI was greater than the non-inferiority margin of -8.00%, the efficacy of remimazolam tosylate was non-inferior to propofol. Besides, induction time of sedation was increased (",

        "Abstract": "Chronic postoperative pain hinders functional recovery after bone fracture and orthopedic surgery. Recently reported evidence indicates that caspase-6 is important in excitatory synaptic plasticity and pathological pain. Meanwhile, netrin-1 controls postsynaptic recruitment of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) and synaptogenesis. The present work aimed to examine whether caspase-6 and netrin-1 contribute to fracture-induced postoperative allodynia. A mouse model of tibial fracture by intramedullary pinning was generated for inducing postoperative pain. Then, paw withdrawal threshold, spinal caspase-6 activity, netrin-1 secretion, AMPAR trafficking, and spine morphology were examined. Caspase-6 inhibition and netrin-1 knockdown by shRNA were performed to elucidate the pathogenetic mechanism of allodynia and its prevention. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording was performed to assess caspase-6's function in spinal AMPAR-induced current. Tibial fractures after orthopedic operation initiated persistent postsurgical mechanical and cold allodynia, accompanied by increased spinal active caspase-6, netrin-1 release, GluA1-containing AMPAR trafficking, spine density, and AMPAR-induced current in dorsal horn neurons. Caspase-6 inhibition reduced fracture-associated allodynia, netrin-1 secretion, and GluA1 trafficking. Netrin-1 deficiency impaired fracture-caused allodynia, postsynaptic GluA1 recruitment, and spine plasticity. The specific GluA2-lacking AMPAR antagonist NASPM also dose dependently prevented postoperative pain. The reduction of fracture-mediated postoperative excitatory synaptic AMPAR current in the dorsal horn by caspase-6 inhibition was compromised by recombinant netrin-1. Exogenous caspase-6 induced pain hypersensitivity, reversing by netrin-1 knockdown or coapplication of NASPM. Thus, spinal caspase-6 modulation of GluA1-containing AMPAR activation and spine morphology through netrin-1 secretion is important in the development of fracture-related postsurgical pain in the mouse.",

        "Title": "Protective effects of Coenzyme Q10 against sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment through regulating apolipoprotein E and phosphorylated Tau expression in young mice.",
        "Abstract": "Children with multiple exposures to anesthesia and surgery may be more likely to develop the learning disability. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) was reported to reduce the multiple sevoflurane treatment-induced cognitive deficiency in 6-day-old young mice. However, its specific mechanisms have not yet been found. This research aimed to reveal the role of ApoE in the pathogenesis of cognitive deficiency caused by sevoflurane anesthesia and the protective mechanism of CoQ10 in a multiple sevoflurane treatment model of young mice. The mice were randomly divided into four groups: Control\u00a0+\u00a0corn oil, Sevoflurane\u00a0+\u00a0corn oil, Control\u00a0+\u00a0CoQ10, and Sevoflurane\u00a0+\u00a0CoQ10. Sevoflurane group mice were anesthetized with 3% sevoflurane and 60% oxygen 2\u00a0hr a day for 3\u00a0days, while control group mice received only 60% oxygen. Mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 50\u00a0mg/kg CoQ10 or the same volume of corn oil 30\u00a0min before the inhalation of oxygen or sevoflurane for 3\u00a0days. Mice received sevoflurane anesthesia or control treatment from the 6th to 8th day after birth. The cortex and hippocampus were harvested on the 8th day. The ATP, MMP, ApoE mRNA, total ApoE, ApoE fragments, A\u03b21-40, A\u03b21-42, Tau5, AT8, and PHF levels were detected. The Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed from P30 to p36 after anesthesia or control treatment. The results indicated that the injection of CoQ10 ahead of sevoflurane treatment could reverse the anesthesia-induced energy deficiency, mitochondrial dysfunction, ApoE, and its fragments expression, A\u03b21-42 generation, Tau phosphorylation, and cognitive impairment in young mice. These data reveal that the ApoE and its fragments enhancement may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cognitive deficiency caused by sevoflurane anesthesia. CoQ10 could reduce ApoE expression by improving energy replenishment and mitochondrial functions, thereby alleviating sevoflurane-induced brain damage and cognitive impairment.",

        "Abstract": "Sevoflurane may exert neurotoxic effects on the developing brain. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) has been reported to reduce sevoflurane anesthesia\u2011induced cognitive deficiency in 6\u2011day\u2011old mice. However, its specific mechanisms remain unknown. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has been reported to lead to the initiation of neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may serve an important role in anesthesia\u2011induced neurotoxicity. The present study aimed to reveal the role of ApoE in the pathogenesis of tau protein hyperphosphorylation and neuroinflammation enhancement caused by sevoflurane anesthesia, as well as the protective mechanism of CoQ10 in an anesthetic sevoflurane treatment model of primary mouse hippocampal neurons. For that purpose, the neurons were randomly assigned to the following groups: i)\u00a0Control; ii)\u00a0sevoflurane; iii)\u00a0control+corn oil; iv)\u00a0sevoflurane+corn oil; v)\u00a0control+CoQ10; and vi)\u00a0control+CoQ10. CoQ10 or corn oil alone was added to the medium on day\u00a04 of neuron culture. The neurons in the sevoflurane group were treated with 21% O2, 5% CO2 and 4.1% sevoflurane for 4\u00a0h, whereas the control group only with 21% O2 and 5% CO2 on day\u00a05. Samples were collected immediately after anesthesia or control treatment. ATP, superoxidase dismutase (SOD)1, ApoE mRNA, total ApoE, full\u2011length ApoE, ApoE fragments, Tau5, Tau\u2011PS202/PT205 (AT8), Tau\u2011PSer396/404 (PHF1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2011\u03b1, interleukin (IL)\u20116 and IL\u20111\u03b2 levels were measured with ELISA, quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunocytochemistry. The results of the present study indicated that sevoflurane anesthesia significantly decreased the ATP and SOD levels, but increased ApoE mRNA, total ApoE protein, full\u2011length ApoE, ApoE fragments, phosphorylated tau (AT8 and PHF1) and neuroinflammatory factor (TNF\u2011\u03b1, IL\u20116 and IL\u20111\u03b2) expression levels compared with those in the control group. The use of CoQ10 reversed the expression of these factors. These results suggested that sevoflurane treatment damaged mouse hippocampal neurons, which may be associated with the expression of ApoE and its toxic fragments. CoQ10 improved energy replenishment and inhibited oxidative stress, which may lead to a decrease in ApoE and phosphorylated tau protein expression, thus mitigating the sevoflurane\u2011induced neuroinflammation in mouse hippocampal neurons.",

        "Abstract": "Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is the cognitive impairment resulting from sepsis and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Hydrogen has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent to alleviate SAE. The mechanism, however, remains unclear. This research aimed to determine whether hydrogen alleviates SAE by regulating microglia polarization and whether it is mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-autophagy pathway. Septic models were established by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) performed on mice. The Morris Water Maze was used to evaluate cognitive function. M1/M2 microglia polarization was assessed by immunofluorescence. Inflammatory cytokines were determined by ELISA. Septic cell models were established using BV-2 cells incubated with 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS). M1/M2 microglia polarization was assessed by flow cytometry. Inflammatory cytokines from culture medium supernatant were determined by ELISA, and associated protein expression levels of mTOR-autophagy pathway were assessed by Western blot. Hydrogen inhalation attenuated sepsis-induced cognitive impairment with improved escape latency, time spent in the target platform quadrant and number of times crossing the target platform. In both animal and cell research, hydrogen reduced TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and HMGB1 levels and M1 polarization, but increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 levels and M2 polarization. Hydrogen treatment decreased the ratio of p-mTOR/mTOR and the expression of p62 and increased the ratio of p-AMPK/AMPK, LC3II/LC3I and the expression of TREM-2 and Beclin-1 in LPS-treated BV-2 cells. MHY1485, an mTOR activator, abolished the protective effects of hydrogen in vitro. Taken together, these results demonstrated that hydrogen attenuated sepsis-induced neuroinflammation by modulating microglia polarization, which was mediated by the mTOR-autophagy signaling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "A powerful means to understand the cellular function of corrupt oncogenic signaling programs requires perturbing the system and monitoring the downstream consequences. Here, using a unique pair of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)/normal lung epithelial patient-derived cell lines (HCC4017/HBEC30KT), we systematically interrogated the remodeling of the NSCLC proteome upon treatment with 35 chemical perturbagens targeting a diverse array of mechanistic classes. HCC4017 and HBEC30KT cells differ significantly in their proteomic response to the same compound treatment. Using protein covariance analyses, we identified a large number of functional protein networks. For example, we found that a poorly studied protein, C5orf22, is a novel component of the WBP11/PQBP1 splicing complex. Depletion of C5orf22 leads to the aberrant splicing and expression of genes involved in cell growth and immunomodulation. In summary, we show that by systematically measuring the tumor adaptive responses at the proteomic level, an understanding could be generated that provides critical circuit-level biological insights for these pharmacologic perturbagens.",

        "Title": "Protective effects of hydrogen\u2011rich saline against experimental diabetic peripheral neuropathy via activation of the mitochondrial ATP\u2011sensitive potassium channel channels in rats.",
        "Abstract": "It has previously been demonstrated that hyperglycemia\u2011induced oxidative stress and inflammation are closely associated with the development of diabetic complications, including diabetic neuropathy. Additionally, mitochondrial ATP\u2011sensitive potassium (Mito\u2011K\u2011ATP) channels play a homeostatic role on blood glucose regulation in organisms. Molecular hydrogen (H2) exhibits anti\u2011inflammatory, anti\u2011antioxidative and anti\u2011apoptotic properties and can be used to treat more than 71\u00a0diseases safely. In addition, the diabetes animal models which are set up using streptozotocin (STZ) injection, is a type of high long\u2011term stability, low animal mortality rate and security method. The aim of the current study was to assess the value of hydrogen\u2011rich saline (HS) in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) treatment and to determine its associated mechanisms in STZ\u2011induced diabetic experimental rats. Additionally, the effects of the Mito\u2011K\u2011ATP channels, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis on DPN were also evaluated. From week 5 of STZ injections, HS (2.5, 5 and 10\u00a0ml/kg) was injected into the rat abdominal cavity every day for a period of 4\u00a0weeks. The results of the current study demonstrated that HS significantly reduced behavioral, biochemical and molecular effects caused by DPN. However, 5\u2011hydroxydecanoate, a selective Mito\u2011K\u2011ATP channels general pathway inhibitor, partially eliminated the therapeutic effect of HS on DPN. These results indicated that the use of HS may be a novel strategy to treat DPN by activating the Mito\u2011K\u2011ATP pathway and reducing oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis.",

        "Abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a complication after a spinal nerve injury. The inflammasomes are now identified to be responsible for triggering inflammation in neuropathic pain. Autophagy participates in the process of neuropathic pain and can regulate the inflammasome activation in different diseases. Our previous research reported that hydrogen exerted a protective effect against neuropathic pain. Therefore, we focused on the mechanism and role of autophagy and inflammasome, by which hydrogen alleviated the hyperpathia induced by neuropathic pain. The results showed that neuropathic pain stimulated activation of inflammasome NLRP3 and autophagy pathway in the microglial cells of the spinal cord. The inhibition of NLRP3 inhibited the hyperpathia induced by spinal nerve litigation surgery. The absence of autophagy aggravated the inflammasome activity and hyperpathia. Hydrogen promoted autophagy related protein expression, inhibited the inflammasome NLRP3 pathway activation, and relieved the hyperpathia induced by neuropathic pain. Hydrogen treatment could alleviate hyperpathia by autophagy-mediated NLRP3 inactivation.",

        "Abstract": "PARP1 inhibitors (PARPi) are known to kill tumor cells via two mechanisms (PARP1 catalytic inhibition and PARP1 trapping). The relative contribution of these two pathways in mediating the cytotoxicity of PARPi, however, is not well understood. Here we designed a series of small molecule PARP degraders. Treatment with one such compound iRucaparib-AP6 results in highly efficient and specific PARP1 degradation. iRucaparib-AP6 blocks the enzymatic activity of PARP1 in vitro, and PARP1-mediated poly-ADP-ribosylation signaling in intact cells. This strategy mimics PARP1 genetic depletion, which enables the pharmacological decoupling of PARP1 inhibition from PARP1 trapping. Finally, by depleting PARP1, iRucaparib-AP6 protects muscle cells and primary cardiomyocytes from DNA-damage-induced energy crisis and cell death. In summary, these compounds represent 'non-trapping' PARP1 degraders that block both the catalytic activity and scaffolding effects of PARP1, providing an ideal approach for the amelioration of the various pathological conditions caused by PARP1 hyperactivation.",

        "Abstract": "ADP-ribosylation is a protein post-translational modification that is critically involved in a wide array of biological processes connected to cell stress responses. Enzymes known as poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) catalyze the addition of the ADP-ribose units to amino acids with various side chain chemistries. In particular, the PARP family member PARP1 is responsible for the modification of a large number of proteins and is involved in initiation of the DNA damage response, although the mechanisms through which PARP1 functions are still incompletely understood. The analysis of protein ADP-ribosylation is challenging because PARylation is a low-abundance, labile and heterogeneous protein modification. Recently, we developed an integrative proteomic platform for the site-specific analysis of protein ADP-ribosylation on Asp and Glu residues. Herein, we describe the method, and demonstrate its utility in quantitative characterization of the human Asp- and Glu-ADP-ribosylated proteome.",

        "Abstract": "The LKB1/AMPK pathway plays a\u00a0major role in cellular homeostasis and tumor suppression. Down-regulation of LKB1/AMPK occurs in several human cancers and has been implicated in metabolic diseases. However, the precise upstream regulation of LKB1-AMPK pathway is largely unknown. Here, we report that AMPK activation by LKB1 is regulated by tankyrases. Tankyrases interact with and ribosylate LKB1, promoting its K63-linked ubiquitination by an E3 ligase RNF146, which blocks LKB1/STRAD/MO25 complex formation and LKB1 activation. LKB1 activation by tankyrase inhibitors induces AMPK activation and suppresses tumorigenesis. Similarly, the tankyrase inhibitor G007-LK effectively regulates liver metabolism and glycemic control in diabetic mice in a LKB1-dependent manner. In patients with lung cancer, tankyrase levels negatively correlate with p-AMPK levels and poor survival. Taken together, these findings suggest that tankyrase and RNF146 are major up-stream regulators of LKB1-AMPK pathway and provide another focus for cancer and metabolic disease therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Sepsis is a highly heterogeneous syndrome that is caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The disproportionate inflammatory response to invasive infection is a triggering event inducing sepsis. The activation of in\ufb02ammasomes in sepsis can amplify in\ufb02ammatory responses. It has been reported that damaged mitochondria contribute to NACHT, LRR and PYD domains\u2011containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome\u2011related sepsis. Our previous study revealed that hydrogen (H2) exerts anti\u2011inflammatory effects in sepsis but the detailed mechanism remains to be elucidated. In the present study, septic mice induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used as models of sepsis in vivo and in vitro, respectively. An inducer and inhibitor of autophagy and the NLRP3 inflammasome were administered to investigate the detailed mechanism of action of H2 treatment in sepsis. The results demonstrated that LPS and ATP led to NLRP3 inflammasome pathway activation, excessive cytokine release, mitochondrial dysfunction and the activation of autophagy. CLP induced organ injury and NLRP3 pathway activation. H2 treatment ameliorated vital organ damage, the inflammatory response, mitochondrial dysfunction and NLRP3 pathway activation, and promoted autophagy in macrophages induced by LPS and in CLP mice. However, the inhibitor of autophagy and the inducer of NLRP3 reversed the protective effect of H2 against organ damage, the inflammatory response and mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, the results demonstrated that H2 alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction and cytokine release via autophagy\u2011mediated NLRP3 inflammasome inactivation.",

        "Abstract": "Cell-cell communication via ligand-receptor signaling is a fundamental feature of complex organs. Despite this, the global landscape of intercellular signaling in mammalian liver has not been elucidated. Here we perform single-cell RNA sequencing on non-parenchymal cells isolated from healthy and NASH mouse livers. Secretome gene analysis revealed a highly connected network of intrahepatic signaling and disruption of vascular signaling in NASH. We uncovered the emergence of NASH-associated macrophages (NAMs), which are marked by high expression of triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2), as a feature of mouse and human NASH that is linked to disease severity and highly responsive to pharmacological and dietary interventions. Finally, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) serve as a hub of intrahepatic signaling via HSC-derived stellakines and their responsiveness to vasoactive hormones. These results provide unprecedented insights into the landscape of intercellular crosstalk and reprogramming of liver cells in health and disease.",

        "Title": "Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway participated in the protection of hydrogen sulfide on neuropathic pain in rats.",
        "Abstract": "Neuropathic pain is evoked by aberrant sensory processing in the peripheral or central nervous system, which is characterized by persistent pain, tactile allodynia, or hyperalgesia. Neuroinflammation is associated with the initiation and maintenance of persistent pain in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Hydrogen sulfide plays important regulatory roles in different physiological and pathological conditions. Therefore, we investigated the effect of hydrogen sulfide on allodynia, hyperalgesia and cytokine release in rats with neuropathic pain and the related regulatory mechanism. Neuropathic pain was established by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in rats. Nuclear factor erythroid-2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) siRNA, hemin, Sn-protoporphyrin (SnPP)-IX and/or NaHS were administered to rats with neuropathic pain, and the spinal cord was collected to detect the expression of Nrf2, hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03bab) and the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and high mobility group box (HMGB)-1 by Western blot (WB) analysis, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia and the number of paw lifts were measured at different time points after operation. In the present research, neuropathic pain induced Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in the microglial cells of the spinal cord; Nrf2 and HO-1 were necessary to alleviate the hyperalgesia of CCI-induced rats; NaHS mitigated the hyperalgesia and allodynia induced by the CCI operation; and NaHS mitigated the excessive release of the cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and HMGB1 via the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in the microglial cells of the spinal cord. These results indicated that NaHS exhibited antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects that were associated with the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in the spinal cord of rats with neuropathic pain.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine the protective effect of novel 1,3,5-triazine-procaine derivatives against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Initially, the experiment has been started by the synthesis of procaine, which later got substituted with diverse 1,3,5-triazine derivatives to furnish the final compounds. The target compounds were tested for nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) inhibitory activity in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The antioxidant activity of most potent compound 9i was investigated using hydroxyl radical, DPPH, and superoxide anion scavenging assay. Compound 9i was further evaluated for protective effect against myocardial I/R injury on the basis numerous parameters, for example, hemodynamic parameters (left ventricular developed pressure [LVDP], \u00b1dp/dtmax, coronary flow [CF], and heart rate [HR]), myocardial enzymes (creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), oxidative stress (super oxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT], glutathione [GSH], and glutathione peroxidise [GPx]), histopathology, western blots analysis for B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated x protein (Bax), lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), and NF-\u03baB in cardiac tissues. Compounds showed significant inhibition of NF-\u0138B transcriptional activity in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, revealing compound 9i as a most potent derivative. In vitro results showed efficient reduction of reduced hydroxyl radical, DPPH, and superoxide anion by 9i. The level LVDP, \u00b1dp/dtmax, CF, HR, TBARS, SOD, CAT, GSH, GPx, and damaged cardiac histopathology were completely restored to normal in 9i-treated group, as compared to I/R group. In western blot analysis, the expression of Bax, LOX-1, and NF-\u0138B was found to be decreased, while the level of Bcl-2 was found to be increased in 9i-treated group. The procaine-1,3,5-triazine derivatives showed significant cardioprotective action via inhibition of NF-\u0138B.",

        "Title": "Electroacupuncture alleviates morphine\u2011induced hyperalgesia by regulating spinal CB1\u00a0receptors and ERK1/2 activity.",
        "Abstract": "Electroacupuncture (EA), a traditional Chinese therapeutic technique, is considered an effective method for treating certain painful neuropathies induced by various neuropathological damage. The current study investigated the effect of EA on intrathecal\u00a0(IT) morphine\u2011induced hyperalgesia\u00a0(MIH) and examined the hypothesis that activation of cannabinoid receptor\u00a01\u00a0(CB1) could enhance the antinociceptive effect of EA on MIH via regulation of the extracellular signal\u2011regulated kinase\u00a01/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway. Using a rat model of IT MIH, mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia were evaluated by an electronic von Frey filament and hotplate at baseline (1\u00a0day before IT administration) and at days\u00a01, 3, 5\u00a0and\u00a07 after IT administration. Rats received IT normal saline, IT morphine or IT morphine\u00a0+\u00a0EA at ST36\u2011GB34. The protein levels of ERK1/2, phosphorylated (p)\u2011ERK1/2 and CB1 in the spinal cord were assayed by western blotting. Furthermore, the effect of IT\u00a0injection of the CB1 agonist WIN\u00a055,212\u20112 and the CB1\u00a0antagonist SR141716 on the antinociceptive effect of EA in rats with MIH was investigated. Nociceptive behavior and ERK1/2, phosphorylated (p)\u2011ERK1/2 and CB1\u00a0protein levels were evaluated as mentioned above. The results revealed that chronic IT\u00a0injections of morphine induced a significant decrease in mechanical withdrawal threshold\u00a0(MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency\u00a0(TWL) accompanied with remarkable upregulation of p\u2011ERK1/2 in the spinal cord, which could be attenuated by EA at the ST36\u2011GB34 acupoints. In the rat model of MIH, IT\u00a0injection of WIN\u00a055,212\u20112 combined with EA induced a significant increase in MWT and TWL accompanied with a significant decrease in p\u2011ERK1/2 and a significant increase in CB1\u00a0protein level compared with EA alone, while SR141716 induced the opposite results. The present study suggests that EA alleviates hyperalgesia induced by IT\u00a0injection of morphine partially through the inhibition of ERK1/2 activation. Activation of the CB1\u00a0receptor enhances the antinociceptive effect of EA in rats with MIH partly through the regulation of the spinal CB1\u2011ERK1/2 signaling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "The macrophage is an innate immune response cell that plays an important role in the development of sepsis. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a sedation drug, which have anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis effects and can be used on sepsis patients in the ICU. However, its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) is a mitochondrial serine/threonine protein kinase that recognizes damaged mitochondria and leads to mitophagy. This study investigated the effects of DEX on Lipopolysaccharides(LPS)-induced macrophage injury and explained the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that LPS treatment caused mitochondrial damage, mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and PINK1-mediated mitophagy; at the same time, PINK1 has a protective effect on LPS-induced macrophage apoptosis and inflammation by mitophagy that eliminates dysfunctional mitochondria. DEX could promote the clearance of damaged mitochondria characterized by low Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and high reactive oxygen species(ROS), thus exerting a protective effect in LPS treated macrophages, and PINK1 mediated mitophagy is required for this protective effect.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic postoperative pain might be a pivotal component hindering recovery and regains the function after bone fracture and orthopedic surgery. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. AMPA receptor of excitatory synapses is considered due to its critical role in pathologic pain. Chemokine CCL1 related neuroinflammation plays a role in excitatory synaptic transmission and nociceptive transduction. This study examined whether spinal CCL1 is associated with fracture-associated postoperative pain via AMPA receptor. We herein discovered that the tibial fracture with orthopedic surgery initiated and maintained chronic postoperative pain along with spinal up-regulation of CCL1/CCR8 expression and phosphorylation of GluA1-containing AMPA receptor. Central CCL1/CCR8 inhibition impaired mechanical and cold allodynia, and phosphorylated GluA1-containing AMPA receptor in the spinal dorsal horn. Intrathecal injection of GluA1-containing AMPA receptor antagonist NASPM alleviated fracture-related postoperative pain. Also, exogenous CCL1 delivery facilitated acute pain behaviors and spinal phosphorylation of GluA1-containing AMPA receptor in na\u00efve mice, reversing by co-application of NASPM. Our current results indicated that spinal CCL1/CCR8-mediated GluA1-containing AMPA receptor activation is vital in the pathogenesis of fracture associated postoperative pain in mice.",

        "Abstract": "Dysregulation of chromatin methylation is associated with defects in cellular differentiation as well as a variety of cancers. How cells regulate the opposing activities of histone methyltransferase and demethylase enzymes to set the methylation status of the epigenome for proper control of gene expression and metabolism remains poorly understood. Here, we show that loss of methylation of the major phosphatase PP2A in response to methionine starvation activates the demethylation of histones through hyperphosphorylation of specific demethylase enzymes. In parallel, this regulatory mechanism enables cells to preserve SAM by increasing SAH to limit SAM consumption by methyltransferase enzymes. Mutants lacking the PP2A methyltransferase or the effector H3K36 demethylase Rph1 exhibit elevated SAM levels and are dependent on cysteine due to reduced capacity to sink the methyl groups of SAM. Therefore, PP2A directs the methylation status of histones by regulating the phosphorylation status of histone demethylase enzymes in response to SAM levels.",

        "Abstract": "In this study, we demonstrated the effects of a high-fiber diet on intestinal lesions, oxidative stress and systemic inflammation in a murine model of endotoxemia. C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to four groups: the control group (CONTROL), which received a commercial normal-fiber rodent diet comprising normal fiber; a CLP group, which received a commercial normal-fiber rodent diet and underwent caecal ligation puncture (CLP); a high-fiber group (HFG), which received a commercial high-fiber rodent diet; and a high fiber + CLP group (HFCLP) which received a commercial high-fiber rodent diet and underwent CLP (30%). The sepsis model was created via CLP after 2 weeks of dietary intervention. Notably, dietary high-fiber supplementation in HFCLP group improved survival rates and reduced bacterial loads, compared with CLP alone. In the HFCLP group, dietary fiber supplementation decreased the serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and high-mobility group protein 1 (HMG-1) but raised the concentration of interleukin 10 (IL-10), compared with the levels in CLP mice. Meanwhile, high-fiber supplementation increased the relative proportions of ",

        "Abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is considered to be the most common cause of microvascular diabetic complications, for which no effective therapies currently exist. Previous studies have identified that oxidative stress is the common pathway in all possible hypotheses for the induction of DPN, and poly(ADP\u2011ribose) (PAR) polymerase\u20111 (PARP\u20111)\u2011dependent cell death (parthanatos) is key in the pathogenic mechanisms of neurodegenerative disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects and corresponding mechanisms of hydrogen\u2011rich medium (HM) on high glucose (HG)\u2011induced oxidative stress and parthanatos in primary rat Schwann cells (RSCs) in\u00a0vitro. The RSCs were divided into groups and treated for 48 h. Cell counting kit\u20118 and lactate dehydrogenase assays were used to detect cell viability and cytotoxicity, respectively; intracellular OH\u2011 levels were measured using a DCFH\u2011DA assay; concentrations of peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2011) and 8\u2011hydroxy deoxyguanosine (8\u2011OHdG) were evaluated with an enzyme\u2011linked immunosorbent assay; relative expression levels of parthanatos\u2011related proteins [PAR, nucleus apoptosis\u2011inducing factor (AIF) and total AIF] were analyzed using western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence was used to determine the nuclear translocation of AIF. After 48\u00a0h, HG was shown to induce severe oxidative stress and promote marked levels of parthanatos in the RSCs. Treatment with HM inhibited HG\u2011induced oxidative stress by reducing the production of OH\u2011 and ONOO\u2011 and suppressed parthanatos by downregulating the levels of 8\u2011OHdG, the expression of PAR and the nuclear translocation of AIF. HM improved cell viability and inhibited cytotoxicity under the HG condition. These results indicate that HM effectively reduces HG\u2011induced oxidative stress in RSCs and protects them against parthanatos. Therefore, HM may be a novel treatment for DPN.",

        "Abstract": "Ischemic stroke causes endothelial dysfunction and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, thus damages synaptic plasticity such as learning and memory. In this study we aim to investigate the effect of hemopexin (HPX) in protecting synaptic plasticity and blood brain barrier integrity from toxic heme, and determine whether this effect is via the activation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) through the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway. Our data indicates HPX showed a significant effect in inducing the expression of HO-1, promoting the migration and differentiation of EPCs, facilitating new blood vessel formation thus protecting blood-brain barrier integrity. Also the magnitude of synaptic plasticity of rats recovered with HPX treatment. And in the presence of HO-1 blocker Zinc protoporphyrin-9 (ZnppIX), HPX lost its protective effect. This suggests that HPX protects endothelial and blood brain barrier integrity from toxic heme, thus protects neurologic function in cerebral ischemic rats in HO-1 pathway.",

        "Title": "Effect of autophagy on allodynia, hyperalgesia and astrocyte activation in a rat model of neuropathic pain.",
        "Abstract": "Primary damage or dysfunction of the nervous system may cause or initiate neuropathic pain. However, it has been difficult to establish an effective treatment for neuropathic pain, as the mechanisms responsible for its pathology remain largely unknown. Autophagy is closely associated with the pathological process of neurodegenerative diseases, neuropathic injury and cancer, among others. The aim of the present study was to examine the changes in the autophagy\u2011lysosomal pathway and discuss the effects of autophagy on allodynia, hyperalgesia and astrocyte activation in neuropathic pain. A neuropathic pain model was induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) in rats. Inducers and inhibitors of autophagy and lysosomes were used to assess autophagy, allodynia, hyperalgesia and astrocyte activity. Neuropathic pain was found to induce an increase in the levels of the autophagy\u2011related proteins, LC3II and Beclin 1 and, and in those of the lysosomal proteins, lysosomal\u2011associated membrane protein type\u00a02 (LAMP2) and Ras\u2011related protein Rab\u20117a (RAB7), whereas p62 levels were found to decrease from day 1 to 14 following CCI. The autophagy inducer, rapamycin, further increased the LC3II, Beclin 1, lysosomal\u2011associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) and Ras\u2011related protein Rab\u20117a (RAB7) expression levels, and decreased the p62 expression levels, which were accompanied by alleviation of allodynia, hyperalgesia and astrocyte activation in the rats subjected to CCI; the autophagy inhibitor, 3\u2011methyladenine, reversed these effects. The use of the lysosomal inhibitors, bafilomycin and chloroquine, resulted in the accumulation of LC3II and Beclin 1, a decrease in the levels of LAMP2 and RAB7, and the exacerbation of allodynia, hyperalgesia and astrocyte activation in rats with neuropathic pain. On the whole, the findings of this study indicate that neuropathic pain activates autophagy, which alleviates mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and suppresses astrocyte activity. Therefore, neuropathic pain induced by CCI in rats appears to be mediated via the autophagy\u2011lysosomal pathway.",

        "Title": "Dexmedetomidine Added to Sufentanil Patient-Controlled Intravenous Analgesia Relieves the Postoperative Pain after Cesarean Delivery: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Multicenter Study.",
        "Abstract": "This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine in intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) after cesarean delivery. This multicenter study enrolled 208 subjects who were scheduled for selective cesarean delivery from 9 research centers. Patients received 0.5\u2009ug/kg dexmedetomidine (study group) or normal saline (control group) after delivery and an intravenous PCA pump after surgery (100\u2009\u03bcg sufentanil +300\u2009\u03bcg dexmedetomidine for the study group, 100\u2009\u03bcg sufentanil for the control group, background infusion: 1\u2009ml/h, bolus dose: 2\u2009ml and lock time: 8\u2009min). The sufentanil consumption, pain scores, rescue analgesia, sedation scores, analgesic satisfaction, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and the first passage of flatus were recorded within 24\u2009h after surgery. The sufentanil consumption in the study group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p\u2009=\u20090.004). Compared with the control group, the study group had lower pain scores (p\u2009<\u20090.01), higher analgesic satisfaction degree [p\u2009<\u20090.001, odd ratio 4.28 and 95% CI (2.46, 7.46)], less requirement of rescue analgesia (p\u2009=\u20090.003), lower incidence of PONV (p\u2009=\u20090.005 and p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively), and shorter time to first passage of flatus (p\u2009=\u20090.007). Dexmedetomidine added to sufentanil intravenous PCA significantly enhanced the analgesic effects, improved analgesic satisfaction, and had the potential benefits of reducing PONV and the recovery of intestinal functions after cesarean section.",

        "Abstract": "The mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1)-signaling system plays a critical role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by sensing and integrating multiple extracellular and intracellular cues. Therefore, uncovering the effectors of mTORC1 signaling is pivotal to understanding its pathophysiological effects. Here we report that the transcription factor forkhead/winged helix family k1 (Foxk1) is a mediator of mTORC1-regulated gene expression. Surprisingly, Foxk1 phosphorylation is increased upon mTORC1 suppression, which elicits a 14-3-3 interaction, a reduction of DNA binding, and nuclear exclusion. Mechanistically, this occurs by mTORC1-dependent suppression of nuclear signaling by the Foxk1 kinase, Gsk3. This pathway then regulates the expression of multiple genes associated with glycolysis and downstream anabolic pathways directly modulated by Foxk1 and/or by Foxk1-regulated expression of Hif-1\u03b1. Thus, Foxk1 mediates mTORC1-driven metabolic rewiring, and it is likely to be critical for metabolic diseases where improper mTORC1 signaling plays an important role.",

        "Abstract": "Opioid use has been limited in the treatment of chronic pain due to their side effects, including analgesic tolerance. Previous studies demonstrated that glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) may be involved in the development of chronic morphine tolerance; however, the mechanism remains unknown. It was hypothesized that the expression of spinal phosphorylated mitogen\u2011activated protein kinase [MAPK; phosphorylated extracellular signal\u2011regulated kinase (ERK)] is regulated through the spinal GRs, following chronic treatment with morphine. In the first experiment, the experimental rats were randomly divided into four groups: Control, morphine, morphine+GR antagonist mifepristone (RU38486) and morphine+GR agonist dexamethasone (Dex). Each group was treated with continuous intrathecal (IT) injection of the drugs for 6\u00a0days. The expression of GRs and MAPK 3/1 (p\u2011ERK 1/2) in the spinal dorsal horn was detected by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. In the second experiment, the MAPK inhibitor PD98059 was added and the rats were randomly divided into four groups: Control, morphine, PD98059+morphine and PD98059+morphine+Dex. The continuous IT injection lasted for 7\u00a0days in each group. For all experiments, the tail flick test was conducted 30\u00a0min following administration every day to assess the thermal hyperalgesia of the rats. The experimental results demonstrated that there was a co\u2011existence of GRs and p\u2011ERK 1/2 in the spinal cord dorsal horn by double immunofluorescence staining. The GR antagonist RU38486 attenuated the morphine analgesia tolerance by inhibiting the expression of GR and increasing the expression of p\u2011ERK. The MAPK inhibitor PD98059 increased the effect of morphine tolerance and prolonged the duration of morphine tolerance. The present results suggest that spinal GRs may serve an important role in the development of morphine tolerance through the ERK signaling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "The conserved GATOR1 complex consisting of NPRL2-NPRL3-DEPDC5 inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in response to amino acid insufficiency. Here, we show that loss of NPRL2 and GATOR1 function in skeletal muscle causes constitutive activation of mTORC1 signaling in the fed and fasted states. Muscle fibers of NPRL2 knockout animals are significantly larger and show altered fiber-type composition, with more fast-twitch glycolytic and fewer slow-twitch oxidative fibers. NPRL2 muscle knockout mice also have altered running behavior and enhanced glucose tolerance. Furthermore, loss of NPRL2 induces aerobic glycolysis and suppresses glucose entry into the TCA cycle. Such chronic activation of mTORC1 leads to compensatory increases in anaplerotic pathways to replenish TCA intermediates that are consumed for biosynthetic purposes. These phenotypes reveal a fundamental role for the GATOR1 complex in the homeostatic regulation of mitochondrial functions (biosynthesis versus ATP) to mediate carbohydrate utilization in muscle.",

        "Title": "Proteomic Analysis of the Downstream Signaling Network of PARP1.",
        "Abstract": "Poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) is a protein posttranslational modification (PTM) that is critically involved in many biological processes that are linked to cell stress responses. It is catalyzed by a class of enzymes known as poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs). In particular, PARP1 is a nuclear protein that is activated upon sensing nicked DNA. Once activated, PARP1 is responsible for the synthesis of a large number of PARylated proteins and initiation of the DNA damage response mechanisms. This observation provided the rationale for developing PARP1 inhibitors for the treatment of human malignancies. Indeed, three PARP1 inhibitors (Olaparib, Rucaparib, and Niraparib) have recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Moreover, in 2017, both Olaparib and Niraparib have also been approved for the treatment of fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer. Despite this very exciting progress in the clinic, the basic signaling mechanism that connects PARP1 to a diverse array of biological processes is still poorly understood. This is, in large part, due to the inherent technical difficulty associated with the analysis of protein PARylation, which is a low-abundance, labile, and heterogeneous PTM. The study of PARylation has been greatly facilitated by the recent advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies tailored to the analysis of this modification. In this Perspective, we discuss these breakthroughs, including their technical development, and applications that provide a global view of the many biological processes regulated by this important protein modification.",

        "Abstract": "Translation is principally regulated at the initiation stage. The development of the translation initiation (TI) sequencing (TI-seq) technique has enabled the global mapping of TIs and revealed unanticipated complex translational landscapes in metazoans. Despite the wide adoption of TI-seq, there is no computational tool currently available for analyzing TI-seq data. To fill this gap, we develop a comprehensive toolkit named Ribo-TISH, which allows for detecting and quantitatively comparing TIs across conditions from TI-seq data. Ribo-TISH can also predict novel open reading frames (ORFs) from regular ribosome profiling (rRibo-seq) data and outperform several established methods in both computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. Applied to published TI-seq/rRibo-seq data sets, Ribo-TISH uncovers a novel signature of elevated mitochondrial translation during amino-acid deprivation and predicts novel ORFs in 5'UTRs, long noncoding RNAs, and introns. These successful applications demonstrate the power of Ribo-TISH in extracting biological insights from TI-seq/rRibo-seq data.",

        "Abstract": "PARP1 plays a critical role in regulating many biological processes linked to cellular stress responses. Although DNA strand breaks are potent stimuli of PARP1 enzymatic activity, the context-dependent mechanism regulating PARP1 activation and signaling is poorly understood. We performed global characterization of the PARP1-dependent, Asp/Glu-ADP-ribosylated proteome in a panel of cell lines originating from benign breast epithelial cells, as well as common subtypes of breast cancer. From these analyses, we identified 503 specific ADP-ribosylation sites on 322 proteins. Despite similar expression levels, PARP1 is differentially activated in these cell lines under genotoxic conditions, which generates signaling outputs with substantial heterogeneity. By comparing protein abundances and ADP-ribosylation levels, we could dissect cell-specific PARP1 targets that are driven by unique expression patterns versus cell-specific regulatory mechanisms of PARylation. Intriguingly, PARP1 modifies many proteins in a cell-specific manner, including those involved in transcriptional regulation, mRNA metabolism, and protein translation.",

Here, we demonstrate that mTORC1 promotes lipid biogenesis via SRPK2, a key regulator of RNA-binding SR proteins. mTORC1-activated S6K1 phosphorylates SRPK2 at Ser494, which primes Ser497 phosphorylation by CK1. These phosphorylation events promote SRPK2 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of SR proteins. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals that lipid biosynthetic enzymes are among the downstream targets of mTORC1-SRPK2 signaling. Mechanistically, SRPK2 promotes SR protein binding to U1-70K to induce splicing of lipogenic pre-mRNAs. Inhibition of this signaling pathway leads to intron retention of lipogenic genes, which triggers nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SRPK2 blunts de novo lipid synthesis, thereby suppressing cell growth. These results thus reveal a novel role of mTORC1-SRPK2 signaling in post-transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism and demonstrate that SRPK2 is a potential therapeutic target for mTORC1-driven metabolic disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Inadvertent intraoperative hypothermia (core temperature <36\u2009\u00b0C) is a frequent but preventable complication of general anesthesia. Accurate risk assessment of individual patients may help physicians identify patients at risk for hypothermia and apply preventive approaches, which include active intraoperative warming. This study aimed to develop and validate a risk-prediction model for intraoperative hypothermia. Two independent observational studies in China, the Beijing Regional Survey and the China National Survey, were conducted in 2013 and 2014, respectively, to determine the incidence of hypothermia and its underlying risk factors. In this study, using data from these two studies, we first derived a risk calculation equation, estimating the predictive risk of hypothermia using National Survey data (3132 patients), then validated the equation using the Beijing Regional Survey data (830 patients). Measures of accuracy, discrimination and calibration were calculated in the validation data set. Through validation, this model, named Predictors Score, had sound overall accuracy (Brier Score\u2009=\u20090.211), good discrimination (C-Statistic\u2009=\u20090.759) and excellent calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow, P\u2009=\u20090.5611). We conclude that the Predictors Score is a valid predictor of the risk of operative hypothermia and can be used in deciding whether intraoperative warming is a cost-effective measure in preventing the hypothermia.",

        "Abstract": "Cold hyperalgesia is an intractable sensory abnormality commonly seen in peripheral neuropathies. Although glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha3 (GFR\u03b13) is required for the formation of pathological cold pain has been revealed, potential transduction mechanism is poorly elucidated. We have previously demonstrated the contribution of enhanced activity of transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) to cold hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain using a rat model of chronic constriction injury (CCI) to the sciatic nerve. Recently, the enhancement of TRPM8 activity is attributed to the increased TRPM8 plasma membrane trafficking. In addition, TRPM8 can be sensitized by the activation of GFR\u03b13, leading to increased cold responses in vivo. The aim of this study was to investigate whether GFR\u03b13 could influence cold hyperalgesia of CCI rats via modulating TRPM8 expression and plasma membrane trafficking in dorsal root ganglion (DRG).",

        "Abstract": "We studied the effects of minocycline (an inhibitor of microglial activation) on the expression and activity of Notch-1 receptor, and explored the therapeutic efficacy of minocycline combined with Notch inhibitor DAPT in the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP). Diabetic rat model was established by intraperitoneal injection (ip) of Streptozotocin (STZ). Expression and activity of Notch-1 and expression of macrophage/microglia marker Iba-1 were detected by WB. Diabetes induction significantly attenuated sciatic nerve conduction velocity, and dramatically augmented the expression and the activity of Notch-1 in the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord. Minocycline treatment, however, accelerated the decreased conduction velocity of sciatic nerve and suppressed Notch-1expression and activity in diabetic rats. Similar to DAPT treatment, minocycline administration also prolonged thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) and increase mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) in diabetic rats in response to heat or mechanical stimulation via inhibition the expression and the activity of Notch-1 in spinal cord. Combination of DAPT and minocycline further inhibited Notch-1 receptor signaling and reduce neuropathic pain exhibited as improved TWL and MWT. Our study revealed a novel mechanism of Notch-1 receptor inhibition in spinal cord induced by minocycline administration, and suggested that the combination of minocycline and DAPT has the potential to treat DNP.",

        "Title": "Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) Embedded Core-Needle Biopsy of Lung Cancer.",
        "Abstract": "With recent advances in understanding the genomic underpinnings and oncogenic drivers of pathogenesis in different subtypes, it is increasingly clear that proper pretreatment diagnostics are essential for the choice of appropriate treatment options for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tumor tissue preservation in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound is commonly used in the surgical suite. However, proteins recovered from OCT-embedded specimens pose a challenge for LC-MS/MS experiments, due to the large amounts of polymers present in OCT. Here we present a simple workflow for whole proteome analysis of OCT-embedded NSCLC tissue samples, which involves a simple trichloroacetic acid precipitation step. Comparisons of protein recovery between frozen versus OCT-embedded tissue showed excellent consistency with more than 9200 proteins identified. Using an isobaric labeling strategy, we quantified more than 5400 proteins in tumor versus normal OCT-embedded core needle biopsy samples. Gene ontology analysis indicated that a number of proliferative as well as squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) marker proteins were overexpressed in the tumor, consistent with the patient's pathology based diagnosis of \"poorly differentiated SqCC\". Among the most downregulated proteins in the tumor sample, we noted a number of proteins with potential immunomodulatory functions. Finally, interrogation of the aberrantly expressed proteins using a candidate approach and cross-referencing with publicly available databases led to the identification of potential druggable targets in DNA replication and DNA damage repair pathways. We conclude that our approach allows LC-MS/MS proteomic analyses on OCT-embedded lung cancer specimens, opening the way to bring powerful proteomics into the clinic. Graphical Abstract \u115f.",

        "Abstract": "Insulin resistance is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. Although multiple genetic and physiological factors interact to cause insulin resistance, deregulated signaling by phosphorylation is a common underlying mechanism. In particular, the specific phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanisms and signaling outputs of insulin are poorly understood in hepatocytes, which represents one of the most important insulin-responsive cell types. Using primary rat hepatocytes as a model system, we performed reductive dimethylation (ReDi)-based quantitative mass spectrometric analysis and characterized the phosphoproteome that is regulated by insulin as well as its key downstream kinases including Akt, mTORC1, and S6K. We identified a total of 12\u202f294 unique, confidently localized phosphorylation sites and 3805 phosphorylated proteins in this single cell type. Detailed bioinformatic analysis on each individual data set identified both known and previously unrecognized targets of this key insulin downstream effector pathway. Furthermore, integrated analysis of the hepatic Akt/mTORC1/S6K signaling axis allowed the delineation of the substrate specificity of several close-related kinases within the insulin signaling pathway. We expect that the data sets will serve as an invaluable resource, providing the foundation for future hypothesis-driven research that helps delineate the molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and related metabolic syndrome.",

        "Title": "Itraq-Based Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Lungs in Murine Polymicrobial Sepsis with Hydrogen Gas Treatment.",
        "Abstract": "Sepsis-associated acute lung injury (ALI), which carries a high morbidity and mortality in patients, has no effective therapeutic strategies to date. Our group has already reported that hydrogen gas (H2) exerts a protective effect against sepsis in mice. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying H2 treatment are not fully understood. This study investigated the effects of H2 on lung injuries in septic mice through the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic analysis. Male ICR mice used in this study were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham operation. And 2% H2 was inhaled for 1\u200ah beginning at 1 and 6\u200ah after sham or CLP operation. The iTRAQ-based liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was preformed to investigate lung proteomics. Sepsis-challenged animals had decreased survival rate, as well as had increased bacterial burden in blood, peritoneal lavage, and lung sample, which were significantly ameliorated by H2 treatment. Moreover, a total of 4,472 proteins were quantified, and 192 differentially expressed proteins were related to the protective mechanism of H2 against sepsis. Functional enrichment analysis showed that H2-related differential proteins could be related to muscle contraction, oxygen transport, protein synthesis, collagen barrier membranes, cell adhesion, and coagulation function. These proteins were significantly enriched in four signaling pathways, and two of which are associated with coagulation. In addition, H2 alleviates ALI in septic mice through downregulating the expression of Sema 7A, OTULIN, and MAP3K1 as well as upregulating the expression of Transferrin. Thus, our findings provide an insight into the mechanism of H2 treatment in sepsis by proteomic approach, which may be helpful to the clinic application of H2 in patients with sepsis.",

        "Abstract": "Many reports recapitulate the contribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) over-accumulation to the organ damage; it is of significance to strictly target ROS production. In this study, we evaluated the potential role of TLR7 agonist gardiquimod (GDQ) in oxidative stress (OS) in liver injury induced by sepsis. Here, we observed that intraperitoneal pretreatment with GDQ dramatically elevated the septic survival rate and effectively attenuated the septic liver injury. Interestingly, the increased ROS and inflammatory factor IL-6 levels were reversed after GDQ intervention. Subsequently, Western blot was employed to determine the definite mechanism. As expected, it was showed that the upregulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun pathway in liver of septic animals was considerably suppressed by GDQ pre-exposure. Our current result highlight that pre-administration of GDQ ameliorated sepsis induced hepatotoxicity and reduced the generation of IL-6 and OS responses, which was associated with downregulation of JNK/c-Jun pathway. Our strategies might be ultimately beneficial in mitigating liver injury symptom.",

        "Title": "Hydrogen Gas Protects Against Intestinal Injury in Wild Type But Not NRF2 Knockout Mice With Severe Sepsis by Regulating HO-1 and HMGB1 Release.",
        "Abstract": "The intestine plays an important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Hydrogen gas (H2), which has anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects, can be effectively used to treat septic mice. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a redox-sensitive master switch that regulates the expression of antioxidant and protective enzymes. This study investigated the effects of 2% H2 on intestinal injuries and the underlying mechanisms in a mouse model of severe sepsis. Male Nrf2 knockout mice (Nrf2-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were randomized into four groups: sham, sham+H2, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and CLP+H2. The survival rate was observed and recorded within 7 days, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, HMGB1), anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, and catalase ), and oxidative products (MDA, 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1) were detected in the serum and intestine using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, the protein and mRNA levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) were measured by Western blotting and quantitative PCR, respectively. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry were used to measure HMGB1 and HO-1 release into the intestine, respectively. The results showed that therapy with 2% H2 increased the survival rate, alleviated the injuries caused by oxidative stress and inflammation, reduced HMGB1 levels but increased HO-1 levels in WT septic mice, but not in Nrf2-KO mice. These data demonstrate that 2% H2 inhalation may be a promising therapeutic strategy for intestinal injuries caused by severe sepsis through the regulation of HO-1 and HMGB1 release. In addition, Nrf2 plays a key role in the protective effects of H2 against intestinal damage in this disease.",

        "Title": "Prevention of Remifentanil Induced Postoperative Hyperalgesia by Dexmedetomidine via Regulating the Trafficking and Function of Spinal NMDA Receptors as well as PKC and CaMKII Level In Vivo and In Vitro.",
        "Abstract": "Remifentanil-induced secondary hyperalgesia has been demonstrated in both animal experiments and clinical trials. Enhancement of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor trafficking as well as protein kinase C (PKC) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) have been reported to be involved in the induction and maintenance of central sensitization. In the current study, it was demonstrated that dexmedetomidine could prevent remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia (RIH) via regulating spinal NMDAR-PKC-Ca2+/ CaMKII pathway in vivo and in vitro. We firstly investigated the effect of dexmedetomidine, a highly selective \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist, on mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia using a rat model of RIH. NMDA receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A and NR2B) expression and membrane trafficking as well as PKC and CaMKII expression in spinal cord L4-L5 segments were measured by Western blot analysis. The expression of NMDA receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A and NR2B) were also detected by immunohistochemistry. Further more, the effect of dexmedetomidine on NMDA receptor current amplitude and frequency in spinal cord slices were investigated by whole-cell patch-clamp recording. We found that remifentail infusion at 1.2 \u03bcg.kg-1.min-1 for 90 min caused mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, up-regulated NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B expression in both membrane fraction and total lysate as well as increased PKC and CaMKII expression in spinal cord dorsal horn. Subcutaneously injection of dexmedetomidine at the dose of 50 \u03bcg/kg at 30 min before plantar incision significantly attenuated remifentanil-induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia from 2 h to 48 h after infusion, and this was associated with reversal of up-regulated NR1 and NR2B subunits in both membrane fraction and total lysate as well as increased PKC and CaMKII expression in spinal cord dorsal horn. Furthermore, remifentanil incubation increased amplitude and frequency of NMDA receptor-induced current in dorsal horn neurons, which was dose-dependently attenuated by dexmedetomidine. These results suggest that dexmedetomidine can significantly ameliorate RIH via modulating the expression, membrane trafficking and function of NMDA receptors as well as PKC and CaMKII level in spinal dorsal horn, which present useful insights into the mechanistic action of dexmedetomidine as a potential anti-hyperalgesic agents for treating RIH.",

        "Abstract": "Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) is a post-translational modification of proteins mediated by PARP\u00a0family members, such as PARP-1. Although PARylation has been studied extensively, few examples of definitive biological roles for site-specific PARylation have been reported. Here we show that C/EBP\u03b2, a key pro-adipogenic transcription factor, is PARylated by PARP-1 on three amino acids in a conserved regulatory domain. PARylation at these sites inhibits C/EBP\u03b2's DNA binding and transcriptional activities and attenuates adipogenesis in various genetic and cell-based models. Interestingly, PARP-1 catalytic activity drops precipitously during the first 48\u00a0hr of differentiation, corresponding to a\u00a0release of C/EBP\u03b2 from PARylation-mediated inhibition. This promotes the binding of C/EBP\u03b2 at enhancers controlling the expression of adipogenic target genes and continued differentiation. Depletion or chemical inhibition of PARP-1, or mutation of the PARylation sites on C/EBP\u03b2, enhances these early adipogenic events. Collectively, our results provide a clear example of how site-specific PARylation drives biological outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Acute remifentanil exposure during intraoperative analgesia might enhance sensitivity to noxious stimuli and nociceptive responses to innocuous irritation. Cyclooxygenase inhibition was demonstrated to attenuate experimental remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia (RIH) in rodents and human volunteers. The study aimed to compare the effects of preoperative and postoperative flurbiprofen axetil (FA) on RIH after surgery.",

        "Abstract": "Poly[adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose] polymerases (PARPs) are a family of enzymes that modulate diverse biological processes through covalent transfer of ADP-ribose from the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) onto substrate proteins. Here we report a robust NAD(+) analog-sensitive approach for PARPs, which allows PARP-specific ADP-ribosylation of substrates that is suitable for subsequent copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions. Using this approach, we mapped hundreds of sites of ADP-ribosylation for PARPs 1, 2, and 3 across the proteome, as well as thousands of PARP-1-mediated ADP-ribosylation sites across the genome. We found that PARP-1 ADP-ribosylates and inhibits negative elongation factor (NELF), a protein complex that regulates promoter-proximal pausing by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Depletion or inhibition of PARP-1 or mutation of the ADP-ribosylation sites on NELF-E promotes Pol II pausing, providing a clear functional link between PARP-1, ADP-ribosylation, and NELF. This analog-sensitive approach should be broadly applicable across the PARP family and has the potential to illuminate the ADP-ribosylated proteome and the molecular mechanisms used by individual PARPs to mediate their responses to cellular signals.",

        "Abstract": "Complex diseases, such as cancer, are often associated with aberrant gene expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Over the past several years, competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) have emerged as an important class of post-transcriptional regulators that alter gene expression through a miRNA-mediated mechanism. Recent studies in both solid tumors and hematopoietic malignancies showed that ceRNAs have significant roles in cancer pathogenesis by altering the expression of key tumorigenic or tumor-suppressive genes. Characterizing the identity, function, and mechanism of the ceRNAs will not only further our fundamental understanding of RNA-mediated cancer pathogenesis, but may also shed light on the development of new RNA-based therapeutic strategies for treating cancer.",

        "Abstract": "The PI(3)K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway is a highly dynamic network that is balanced and stabilized by a number of feedback inhibition loops. Specifically, activation of mTORC1 has been shown to lead to the inhibition of its upstream growth factor signalling. Activation of the growth factor receptors is triggered by the binding of their cognate ligands in the extracellular space. However, whether secreted proteins contribute to the mTORC1-dependent feedback loops remains unclear. We found that cells with hyperactive mTORC1 secrete a protein that potently inhibits the function of IGF-1. Using a large-scale, unbiased quantitative proteomic platform, we comprehensively characterized the rapamycin-sensitive secretome in TSC2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and identified IGFBP5 as a secreted, mTORC1 downstream effector protein. IGFBP5 is a direct transcriptional target of HIF1, which itself is a known mTORC1 target. IGFBP5 is a potent inhibitor of both the signalling and functional outputs of IGF-1. Once secreted, IGFBP5 cooperates with intracellular branches of the feedback mechanisms to block the activation of IGF-1 signalling. Finally, IGFBP5 is a potential tumour suppressor, and the proliferation of IGFBP5-mutated cancer cells is selectively blocked by IGF-1R inhibitors.",

        "Title": "The role of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin-Annexin A1 pathway in the process of sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction.",
        "Abstract": "Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) is a common geriatric complication, and sevoflurane is a widely accepted inducer of POCD. Although the aetiology of POCD is not clear, a breach in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is involved in early POCD. Annexin A1 has shown protective effects on BBB function. The objective of this study was to investigate both the effects of sevoflurane on the components of the BBB and the underlying mechanism. In vivo treatment with 3.6% sevoflurane for 6 h disrupted BBB components led to fibrinogen invasion and down-regulation of Annexin A1 expression at 24 h after inhalation. The administration of human recombinant Annexin A1 (hr Annexin A1) attenuated the disruption of BBB components, thereby reducing fibrinogen invasion. In addition, the administration of hr Annexin A1 improved cognitive function after the inhalation of 3.6% sevoflurane for 6 h. Moreover, in cultured endothelial cells, 3.6% sevoflurane for 6 h increased GSK-3\u03b2 and decreased \u03b2-catenin levels at 24 h after inhalation. The activation/inhibition of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway attenuated/worsened the sevoflurane-induced decrease in Annexin A1. Our findings indicate that in endothelial cells, treatment with 3.6% sevoflurane for 6 h inhibits the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway, thereby increasing GSK-3\u03b2 and decreasing \u03b2-catenin. By inhibiting this pathway, the gas anaesthetic sevoflurane down-regulated Annexin A1, which consequently breached the BBB and induced POCD. We propose the following cascade for sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction: in microvascular endothelial cells, treatment with 3.6% sevoflurane for 6 h inhibits the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway, increasing GSK-3\u03b2 and decreasing \u03b2-catenin, which down-regulates the expression of Annexin A1. This cascade leads to a breach in the blood-brain barrier, a process which is involved in the occurrence of early postoperative cognitive decline.

        "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men and women in the United States, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) representing 85% of all diagnoses. Late stage detection, metastatic disease and lack of actionable biomarkers contribute to the high mortality rate. Proteins in the extracellular space are known to be critically involved in regulating every stage of the pathogenesis of lung cancer. To investigate the mechanism by which secreted proteins contribute to the pathogenesis of NSCLC, we performed quantitative secretomic analysis of two isogenic NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H1993 and NCI-H2073) and an immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line (HBEC3-KT) as control. H1993 was derived from a chemo-na\u00efve metastatic tumor, while H2073 was derived from the primary tumor after etoposide/cisplatin therapy. From the conditioned media of these three cell lines, we identified and quantified 2713 proteins, including a series of proteins involved in regulating inflammatory response, programmed cell death and cell motion. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicates that a number of proteins overexpressed in H1993 media are involved in biological processes related to cancer metastasis, including cell motion, cell-cell adhesion and cell migration. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knock down of a number of these proteins, including SULT2B1, CEACAM5, SPRR3, AGR2, S100P, and S100A14, leads to dramatically reduced migration of these cells. In addition, meta-analysis of survival data indicates NSCLC patients whose tumors express higher levels of several of these secreted proteins, including SULT2B1, CEACAM5, SPRR3, S100P, and S100A14, have a worse prognosis. Collectively, our results provide a potential molecular link between deregulated secretome and NSCLC cell migration/metastasis. In addition, the identification of these aberrantly secreted proteins might facilitate the development of biomarkers for early detection of this devastating disease.",

        "Abstract": "In insects, the frequency distribution of the measurements of sclerotized body parts is generally used to classify larval instars and is characterized by a multimodal overlap between instar stages. Nonparametric methods with fixed bandwidths, such as histograms, have significant limitations when used to fit this type of distribution, making it difficult to identify divisions between instars. Fixed bandwidths have also been chosen somewhat subjectively in the past, which is another problem. In this study, we describe an adaptive kernel smoothing method to differentiate instars based on discontinuities in the growth rates of sclerotized insect body parts. From Brooks' rule, we derived a new standard for assessing the quality of instar classification and a bandwidth selector that more accurately reflects the distributed character of specific variables. We used this method to classify the larvae of Austrosimulium tillyardianum (Diptera: Simuliidae) based on five different measurements. Based on head capsule width and head capsule length, the larvae were separated into nine instars. Based on head capsule postoccipital width and mandible length, the larvae were separated into 8 instars and 10 instars, respectively. No reasonable solution was found for antennal segment 3 length. Separation of the larvae into nine instars using head capsule width or head capsule length was most robust and agreed with Crosby's growth rule. By strengthening the distributed character of the separation variable through the use of variable bandwidths, the adaptive kernel smoothing method could identify divisions between instars more effectively and accurately than previous methods.",

        "Abstract": "Many DNA and RNA regulatory proteins contain polypeptide domains that are unstructured when analyzed in cell lysates. These domains are typified by an over-representation of a limited number of amino acids and have been termed prion-like, intrinsically disordered or low-complexity (LC) domains. When incubated at high concentration, certain of these LC domains polymerize into labile, amyloid-like fibers. Here, we report methods allowing the generation of a molecular footprint of the polymeric state of the LC domain of hnRNPA2. By deploying this footprinting technique to probe the structure of the native hnRNPA2 protein present in isolated nuclei, we offer evidence that its LC domain exists in a similar conformation as that described for recombinant polymers of the protein. These observations favor biologic utility to the polymerization of LC domains in the pathway of information transfer from gene to message to protein.",

        "Title": "HYDROGEN-RICH MEDIUM AMELIORATES LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-INDUCED BARRIER DYSFUNCTION VIA RHOA-MDIA1 SIGNALING IN CACO-2 CELLS.",
        "Abstract": "Gastrointestinal barrier dysfunction is associated with the severity and prognosis of sepsis. Hydrogen gas (H2) can ameliorate multiple organ damage in septic animals. Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and mammalian diaphanous-related formin 1 (mDia1) are important to regulate tight junction (TJ) and adherens junction (AJ), both of which determine the integrity of the intestinal barrier. This study was aimed to investigate whether H2 could modulate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated dysfunction of the intestinal barrier and whether RhoA-mDia1 signaling is involved. Caco-2 cells were exposed to different concentrations of LPS (1\u200a\u03bcg/mL-1\u200amg/mL). The permeability of the intestinal barrier was evaluated by transepithelial resistance (TER) and fluorescein-isothiocyanate-dextran flux. Expression and distribution of occludin and E-cadherin were analyzed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. RhoA activity was measured by G-Lisa assay, and mDia1 expression was assessed by Western blot. LPS (100\u200a\u03bcg/mL) decreased TER and increased fluorescein-isothiocyanate-dextran flux, which were alleviated by H2-rich medium. Also, H2 down-regulated LPS-induced oxidative stress. Moreover, H2 improved the down-regulated expression and redistribution of occludin and E-cadherin caused by LPS. Additionally, H2 alleviated LPS-caused RhoA activation, and the beneficial effects of H2 on barrier were counteracted by RhoA agonist CN03. Rho inhibitor C3 exoenzyme mitigated LPS-induced barrier breakdown. Furthermore, H2-rich medium increased mDia1 expression, and mDia1 knockdown abolished protections of H2 on barrier permeability. mDia1 knockdown eliminated H2-induced benefits for occludin and E-cadherin. These findings suggest that H2 improves LPS-induced hyperpermeability of the intestinal barrier and disruptions of TJ and AJ by moderating RhoA-mDia1 signaling.",

        "Abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by a rapid loss of kidney function and an antigen-independent inflammatory process that causes tissue damage, which was one of the main manifestations of kidney ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Recent studies have demonstrated autophagy participated in the pathological process of acute kidney injury. In this study, we discuss how autophagy regulated inflammation response in the kidney I/R. AKI was performed by renal I/R. Autophagy activator rapamycin (Rap) and inhibitor 3-methyladenine (MA) were used to investigate the role of autophagy on kidney function and inflammation response. After the experiment, kidney tissues were obtained for the detection of autophagy-related protein microtubule-associated protein light chain 3(LC3)II, Beclin1, and Rab7 and lysosome-associated membrane protein type (LAMP)2 protein by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PT-PCR) and Western blotting, and histopathology and tissue injury scores also. The blood was harvested to measure kidney function (creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels) after I/R. Cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, HMGB1, and IL-10 were measured after I/R. I/R induced the expression of LC3II, Beclin1, LAMP2, and Rab7. The activation and inhibition of autophagy by rapamycin and 3-MA were promoted and attenuated histological and renal function in renal I/R rats, respectively. Cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and HMGB1 were decreased, and IL-10 was further increased after activation of autophagy treated in I/R rats, while 3-MA exacerbated the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, HMGB1, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in renal I/R. I/R can activated the autophagy, and autophagy increase mitigated the renal injury by decreasing kidney injury score, levels of Cr and BUN after renal I/R, and inflammation response via regulating the balance of pro-inflammation and anti-inflammation cytokines.",

        "Title": "Molecular hydrogen protects mice against polymicrobial sepsis by ameliorating endothelial dysfunction via an Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.",
        "Abstract": "Endothelial injury is a primary cause of sepsis and sepsis-induced organ damage. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) plays an essential role in endothelial cellular defenses against inflammation by activating nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). We found that molecular hydrogen (H2) exerts an anti-inflammatory effect. Here, we hypothesized that H2 attenuates endothelial injury and inflammation via an Nrf2-mediated HO-1 pathway during sepsis. First, we detected the effects of H2 on cell viability and cell apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated by LPS. Then, we measured cell adhesion molecules and inflammatory factors in HUVECs stimulated by LPS and in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis mouse model. Next, the role of Nrf2/HO-1 was investigated in activated HUVECs, as well as in wild-type and Nrf(-/-) mice with sepsis. We found that both 0.3 mmol/L and 0.6 mmol/L (i.e., saturated) H2-rich media improved cell viability and cell apoptosis in LPS-activated HUVECs and that 0.6mmol/L (i.e., saturated) H2-rich medium exerted an optimal effect. H2 could suppress the release of cell adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1). Furthermore, H2 could elevate anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels in LPS-stimulated HUVECs and in lung tissue from CLP mice. H2 enhanced HO-1 expression and activity in vitro and in vivo. HO-1 inhibition reversed the regulatory effects of H2 on cell adhesion molecules and inflammatory factors. H2 regulated endothelial injury and the inflammatory response via Nrf2-mediated HO-1 levels. These results suggest that H2 could suppress excessive inflammatory responses and endothelial injury via an Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.",

We thus detected the effects of sevoflurane for different inhalation durations on postoperative cognitive function and investigated the role of GluA2 subunit trafficking in this process.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is considered to be one of the most prevalent and life threatening microvascular diabetic complications. DPN affects up to 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus and there are currently no efficacious therapeutic strategies available for its treatment. Previous studies have reported that oxidative stress and poly(ADP\u2011ribose) polymerase\u20111 (PARP\u20111) may be unifying factors for hyperglycemic injury. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects of hydrogen\u2011rich medium (HM) on high glucose (HG)\u2011mediated oxidative stress, PARP\u20111 activation and the apoptosis of Schwann cells (SCs) in vitro. The cells were divided into different groups, and were treated for 48 h. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated using Cell Counting kit\u20118 and annexin V/propidium iodide assays, respectively. The concentrations of 8\u2011hydroxy\u20112\u2011deoxyguanosine (8\u2011OHdG) and peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2011) were detected using an enzyme\u2011linked immunosorbent assay. The presence of intracellular oxygen free radicals was confirmed using flow cytometric analysis. Colorimetric assays were performed to determine the activity of caspase\u20113, and western blotting was performed to detect the protein expression levels of PARP\u20111, cleaved PARP\u20111, PAR, apoptosis\u2011inducing factor (AIF), B\u2011cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl\u20112) and Bcl\u20112\u2011associated X protein. HG was found to induce severe oxidative stress and promote the caspase\u2011dependent and caspase\u2011independent apoptosis of SCs. Treatment with HM inhibited HG\u2011induced oxidative stress by suppressing hydroxyl and ONOO\u2011 production, levels of 8\u2011OHdG, caspase\u20113 activity and apoptosis in the SCs. Furthermore, treatment with HM downregulated the HG\u2011induced release of PAR, the activation of PARP\u20111 and nuclear translocation of AIF, and upregulated the expression of Bcl\u20112 in the SCs. These results indicated that HM inhibited the HG\u2011induced\u2011oxidative stress\u2011associated caspase\u2011dependent and caspase\u2011independent apoptotic pathways in SCs. Therefore, HM may have potential as a treatment for DPN.",

        "Abstract": "Overactivation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), as a result of sustained DNA oxidation in ischemia-reperfusion injury, triggers programmed cell necrosis and apoptosis. The present study was conducted to demonstrate whether hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) has a neuroprotective effect on retinal ischemia reperfusion (RIR) injury through inhibition of PARP-1 activation. RIR was induced by transient elevation of intraocular pressure in rats. HRS (5 ml/kg) was administered peritoneally every day from the beginning of reperfusion in RIR rats until the rats were sacrificed. Retinal damage and cell death was determined using hematoxylin and eosin and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining. DNA oxidative stress was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine. In addition, the expression of PARP-1 and caspase-3 was investigated by western blot analysis and/or immunohistochemical staining. The results demonstrated that HRS administration improved morphological alterations and reduced apoptosis following RIR injury. Furthermore, the present study found that HRS alleviated DNA oxidation and PARP-1 overactivation in RIR rats. HRS can protect RIR injury by inhibition of PARP-1, which may be involved in DNA oxidative stress and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis.",

We propose two new scoring functions (L- and P-scores), which aim to capture similar characteristics of a peptide-spectrum match (PSM) as Sequest and Comet do. Crescendo, introduced here, is a software program that implements these two scores for peptide identification. We applied Crescendo to test datasets and compared its performance with widely used search engines, including Mascot, Sequest, and Comet. The results indicate that Crescendo identifies a similar or larger number of peptides at various predefined false discovery rates (FDR). Importantly, it also provides a better separation between the true and decoy PSMs, warranting the future development of a companion post-processing filtering algorithm.",

        "Abstract": "Hydrogen gas (H2) has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects and may have beneficial effects in severe sepsis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying these protective effects. Male Institute for Cancer Research mice were randomized into 6 groups: sham; sham + H2; severe sepsis; severe sepsis + H2; severe sepsis + zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX), a heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inhibitor; and severe sepsis + H2 + ZnPPIX. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to induce sepsis. Mice in the H2 groups received inhaled 2% H2 for 1 h at 1 h and 6 h after CLP or sham operation. Mice in the ZnPPIX groups received 40-mg/kg ZnPPIX by intraperitoneal injection 1 h before CLP. Tin protoporphyrin IX (TinPPIX), another HO-1 inhibitor, was also used in part for this study. Mice in the TinPPIX groups received 50-mg/kg TinPPIX through subcutaneous injection 6 h before CLP. The levels of biochemical markers, oxidative products, inflammatory mediator, the number of intestinal apoptotic cells, and the colony-forming unit numbers in the peritoneal lavage fluid were much higher in the severe sepsis group compared with the sham group. Intestinal injury in animals with severe sepsis was worse than that in animals in the sham group. H2 therapy in the animals with severe sepsis was associated with reduced intestinal injury, decreased numbers of colony-forming unit and apoptotic cells, reduced levels of biochemical markers, oxidative products, and high-mobility group box 1 protein. The protective effects of H2 were reversed by ZnPPIX and TinPPIX. Protein and messenger RNA expressions of HO-1 and nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the intestine were increased in the severe sepsis group compared to the sham group, and H2 further increased their expressions in the severe septic mice. Zinc protoporphyrin IX and TinPPIX inhibited the expression of HO-1 protein. Hydrogen has the capacity to protect mice from organ injury in severe sepsis through a mechanism involving HO-1.",

        "Abstract": "Sepsis is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients. In recent years, molecular hydrogen, as an effective free radical scavenger, has been shown a selective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect, and it is beneficial in the treatment of sepsis. Rho-associated coiled-coil protein kinase (ROCK) participates in junction between normal cells, and regulates vascular endothelial permeability. In this study, we used lipopolysaccharide to stimulate vascular endothelial cells and explored the effects of hydrogen-rich medium on the regulation of adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells and vascular endothelial permeability. We found that hydrogen-rich medium could inhibit adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells and decrease levels of adhesion molecules, whereas the levels of transepithelial/endothelial electrical resistance values and the expression of vascular endothelial cadherin were increased after hydrogen-rich medium treatment. Moreover, hydrogen-rich medium could lessen the expression of ROCK, as a similar effect of its inhibitor Y-27632. In addition, hydrogen-rich medium could also inhibit adhesion of polymorphonuclear neutrophils to endothelial cells. In conclusion, hydrogen-rich medium could regulate adhesion of monocytes/polymorphonuclear neutrophils to endothelial cells and vascular endothelial permeability, and this effect might be related to the decreased expression of ROCK protein.",

        "Abstract": "Neuropathic pain (NP) is characterized by persistent pain, tactile allodynia, or hyperalgesia. Peripheral nerve injury contributes to rapid progress of inflammatory response and simultaneously generates neuropathic pain. Hydrogen (H2) has anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, and anti-oxidative stress effects. Therefore, we hypothesized that H2 treatment could alleviate allodynic and hyperalgesic behaviors and the release of inflammatory factors in rats with neuropathic pain. Peripheral neuropathic pain was established by chronic constriction injury of sciatic nerve in rats. H2 was given twice through intraperitoneal injection at a daily dose of 10\u00a0mL/kg during days 1-7 after the operation. Hyperalgesia and allodynia were tested, pro-inflammatory factors of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the spinal cord were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) during days 1-14 after the operation, and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression and activities were measured at day 14 after sciatic nerve injury in rats. After Sn (IV) protoporphyrin IX dihydrochloride (SnPP)-IX, hemin, and carbon monoxide-releasing molecule (CORM)-2 had been given for chronic constriction injury (CCI) in rats, the above indicators were assessed. We found that H2 clearly inhibited hyperalgesia and allodynia in neuropathic pain and also attenuated the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and high-mobility group box (HMGB) 1. H2 improved HO-1 mRNA and protein expression and activities in the process of pain. SnPP-IX reversed the inhibitory effect of H2 on hyperalgesia and allodynia and on pro-inflammatory cytokines in DRG and the spinal cord. The antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of H2 were involved in the activation of HO-1/CO signaling during neuropathic pain in rats.",

        "Abstract": "To enhance the corrosion resistance of Ti-6Al-4V and extend its lifetime in medical applications, Ti-O-N/Ti composite coating was synthesized on the surface via plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIIID). Surface morphology and cross sectional morphology of the composite coating were characterized using atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Although X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis revealed that the Ti-O-N/Ti composite coating was composed of non-stoichiometric titanium oxide, titanium nitride and titanium oxynitride, no obvious characteristic peak corresponding to the crystalline phases of them was detected in the X-ray diffraction pattern. In accordance with Owens-Wendt equation, surface free energy of the uncoated and coated samples was calculated and compared. Moreover, the corrosion behavior of uncoated and coated samples was evaluated by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement, and an equivalent circuit deriving from Randles model was used to fit Bode plots and describe the electrochemical processes occurring at the sample/electrolyte interface. On the basis of the equivalent circuit model, the resistance of the composite coating was 4.7 times higher than that of the passive layer on uncoated samples, indicating the enhanced corrosion resistance after PIIID treatment. Compared to uncoated Ti-6Al-V, Ti-O-N/Ti-coated samples facilitated ostoblast proliferation within 7 days of cell culture, while there was no statistically significant difference in alkaline phosphate activity between uncoated and coated samples during 21 days of cell culture.",

        "Abstract": "PTEN [phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10], a phosphatase and critical tumor suppressor, is regulated by numerous post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and SUMOylation, which affect PTEN localization and protein stability. Here we report ADP-ribosylation as a new post-translational modification of PTEN. We identified PTEN as a novel substrate of tankyrases, which are members of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). We showed that tankyrases interact with and ribosylate PTEN, which promotes the recognition of PTEN by a PAR-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF146, leading to PTEN ubiquitination and degradation. Double knockdown of tankyrase1/2 stabilized PTEN, resulting in the subsequent down-regulation of AKT phosphorylation and thus suppressed cell proliferation and glycolysis in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, tankyrases were up-regulated and negatively correlated with PTEN expression in human colon carcinomas. Together, our study revealed a new regulation of PTEN and highlighted a role for tankyrases in the PTEN-AKT pathway that can be explored further for cancer treatment.",

Peroxynitrite inactivates iron-sulfur cluster that results in mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of iron, leading to mitochondrial iron accumulation. Iron accumulation mediated by divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) plays a key role in N-methyl-D-aspartate neurotoxicity. This study aims to determine whether peroxynitrite contributes to remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia via DMT1-mediated iron accumulation.",

        "Abstract": "The lack of the neuropeptide orexin, also known as hypocretin, results in narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder characterized by frequent sleep/cataplexy attacks and rapid eye movement sleep abnormalities. However, the downstream pathways of orexin signaling are not clearly understood. Here, we show that orexin activates the mTOR pathway, a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism, in the mouse brain and multiple recombinant cell lines that express the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) or orexin 2 receptor (OX2R). This orexin/GPCR-stimulated mTOR activation is sensitive to rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) but is independent of two well known mTORC1 activators, Erk and Akt. Rather, our studies indicate that orexin activates mTORC1 via extracellular calcium influx and the lysosome pathway involving v-ATPase and Rag GTPases. Moreover, a cytoplasmic calcium transient is sufficient to mimic orexin/GPCR signaling to mTORC1 activation in a v-ATPase-dependent manner. Together, our studies suggest that the mTORC1 pathway functions downstream of orexin/GPCR signaling, which plays a crucial role in many physiological and metabolic processes.",

        "Title": "Inhalation of hydrogen gas attenuates brain injury in mice with cecal ligation and puncture via inhibiting neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis.",
        "Abstract": "During the development of sepsis, the complication in central nervous system (CNS), appearing early and frequently relative to other systems, can obviously increase the mortality of sepsis. Moreover, sepsis survivors also accompany long-term cognitive dysfunction, while the ultimate causes and effective therapeutic strategies of brain injury in sepsis are still not fully clear. We designed this study to investigate the effects of 2% hydrogen gas (H2) on brain injury in a mouse model of sepsis. Male ICR mice were underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham operation. 2% H2 was inhaled for 60min beginning at both 1 and 6h after sham or CLP operation, respectively. H2 concentration in arterial blood, venous blood and brain tissue was detected after H2 inhalation separately. The survival rate was observed and recorded within 7 days after sham or CLP operation. The histopathologic changes and neuronal apoptosis were observed in hippocampus by Nissl staining and TUNEL assay. The permeability of brain-blood barrier (BBB), brain water content, inflammatory cytokines, activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT) and oxidative products (MDA and 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1) in serum and hippocampus were detected at 24h after sham or CLP operation. The expressions of nucleus and total nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and cytoplasmic heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) in hippocampus were measured at 24h after sham or CLP operation. We assessed their cognitive function via Y-maze and Fear Conditioning test on day 3, 5, 7 and 14 after operation. H2 treatment markedly improved the survival rate and cognitive dysfunction of septic mice. CLP mice showed obvious brain injury characterized by aggravated pathological damage, BBB disruption and brain edema at 24h after CLP operation, which was markedly alleviated by 2% H2 treatment. Furthermore, we found that the beneficial effects of H2 on brain injury in septic mice were linked to the decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative products and the increased activities of antioxidant enzymes in serum and hippocampus. In addition, 2% H2 inhalation promoted the expression and transposition of Nrf2 and the expression of HO-1 to mitigate brain injury in sepsis. Thus, the inhalation of hydrogen gas may be a promising therapeutic strategy to relieve brain injury in sepsis.",

        "Abstract": "Oxidative damage plays a critical role in many diseases of the central nervous system. This study was conducted to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in the putative anti-oxidative effects of sevoflurane against experimental stroke. Focal cerebral ischemia was performed via 1h of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. At the onset of reperfusion, rats were subjected to postconditioning with sevoflurane or without sevoflurane for 1h. Neurological deficit score was assessed at different time points after reperfusion. Cerebral infarct volume, oxidative stress level and the binding activity of Nrf2 to antioxidant response element were assessed, meanwhile the expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), protein kinase B (Akt) and phosphor-Akt was examined by Western blot at 72h after reperfusion. Sevoflurane postconditioning administration significantly reduced neurological deficit score, infarct volume and oxidative stress levels, while increased the expression of phosphorylation Akt, NQO1, Nrf2 and the binding activity of Nrf2 to ARE in middle cerebral artery occlusion rats. These neuroprotective effects were all suppressed by LY294002, a selective PI3K blocker. Taken together, these findings provided evidence that sevoflurane postconditioning protects brain against ischemic/reperfusion injury, and this neuroprotective effect involves the Akt/Nrf2 pathway.",

We previously reported that activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) contributes to remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia via regulating N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor plasticity in the spinal dorsal horn. In this study, we demonstrated that GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition prevented remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia via regulating \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) expression and function in the spinal dorsal horn.",

It remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients despite developments in monitoring devices, diagnostic tools, and new therapeutic options. Recently, some studies have found that molecular hydrogen is a new therapeutic gas. Our studies have found that hydrogen gas can improve the survival and organ damage in mice and rats with cecal ligation and puncture, zymosan, and lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis. The mechanisms are associated with the regulation of oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and apoptosis, which might be through NF- \u03ba B and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. In this paper, we summarized the progress of hydrogen treatment in sepsis.",

        "Title": "Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis reveals system-wide signaling pathways downstream of SDF-1/CXCR4 in breast cancer stem cells.",
        "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide, with an estimated 1.7 million new cases and 522,000 deaths around the world in 2012 alone. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are essential for tumor reoccurrence and metastasis which is the major source of cancer lethality. G protein-coupled receptor chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) is critical for tumor metastasis. However, stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)/CXCR4-mediated signaling pathways in breast CSCs are largely unknown. Using isotope reductive dimethylation and large-scale MS-based quantitative phosphoproteome analysis, we examined protein phosphorylation induced by SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling in breast CSCs. We quantified more than 11,000 phosphorylation sites in 2,500 phosphoproteins. Of these phosphosites, 87% were statistically unchanged in abundance in response to SDF-1/CXCR4 stimulation. In contrast, 545 phosphosites in 266 phosphoproteins were significantly increased, whereas 113 phosphosites in 74 phosphoproteins were significantly decreased. SDF-1/CXCR4 increases phosphorylation in 60 cell migration- and invasion-related proteins, of them 43 (>70%) phosphoproteins are unrecognized. In addition, SDF-1/CXCR4 upregulates the phosphorylation of 44 previously uncharacterized kinases, 8 phosphatases, and 1 endogenous phosphatase inhibitor. Using computational approaches, we performed system-based analyses examining SDF-1/CXCR4-mediated phosphoproteome, including construction of kinase-substrate network and feedback regulation loops downstream of SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling in breast CSCs. We identified a previously unidentified SDF-1/CXCR4-PKA-MAP2K2-ERK signaling pathway and demonstrated the feedback regulation on MEK, ERK1/2, \u03b4-catenin, and PPP1C\u03b1 in SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling in breast CSCs. This study gives a system-wide view of phosphorylation events downstream of SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling in breast CSCs, providing a resource for the study of CSC-targeted cancer therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Identification of key regulators of lipid metabolism and thermogenic functions has important therapeutic implications for the current obesity and diabetes epidemic. Here, we show that Grb10, a direct substrate of mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), is expressed highly in brown adipose tissue, and its expression in white adipose tissue is markedly induced by cold exposure. In adipocytes, mTOR-mediated phosphorylation at Ser501/503 switches the binding preference of Grb10 from the insulin receptor to raptor, leading to the dissociation of raptor from mTOR and downregulation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. Fat-specific disruption of Grb10 increased mTORC1 signaling in adipose tissues, suppressed lipolysis, and reduced thermogenic function. The effects of Grb10 deficiency on lipolysis and thermogenesis were diminished by rapamycin administration in vivo. Our study has uncovered a unique feedback mechanism regulating mTORC1 signaling in adipose tissues and identified Grb10 as a key regulator of adiposity, thermogenesis, and energy expenditure.",

        "Abstract": "The underlying causes of postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) in old patients remained unelucidated, and there are little descriptions on mechanisms associated with the blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption during POCD. We therefore tested the effects of orthopedic surgery with different concentrations of sevoflurane for 2 h on the behavior test and the BBB permeability in aged rats. 18-month rats were divided into control group and surgical group with propofol anesthesia (0.7 mgkg(-1) min(-1)) and 1.0 MAC, 1.3 MAC, and 1.5 MAC sevoflurane inhalation for 2 h. We assessed their cognitive function via Y-maze and fear conditioning test on day 1, 3, and 7 after experiments. Animals were then assigned to control group, propofol (2 h, 0.7 mgkg(-1) min(-1)) group, surgery plus propofol group and surgery plus 1.5 MAC sevoflurane inhalation for 2h. Their hippocampal BBB permeability was detected with Evans blue quantification. Alterations of tight junctions in hippocampus were measured with occludin and claudin-5 western blot. Then we assessed matrix metalloproteinase-2,9 (MMP-2,9) via western blot and immunohistochemistry staining at day 1, 3, 7, and 14 after experiments. Surgery impaired cognitive function and increased Evans blue leakage into the hippocampus in aged rats while 2 h of 1.5 MAC sevoflurane inhalation potentiated these effects. Surgery induced occludin protein expression decreases and MMP-2,9 proteins increase and these influences can be enhanced by high concentration of sevoflurane inhalation. In conclusion, 1.5 MAC sevoflurane for 2 h exacerbated cognitive impairment induced by orthopedic surgery in aged rats and the breach in BBB may be involved in this process.",

        "Abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions as a critical regulator of cellular growth and metabolism by forming multi-component, yet functionally distinct complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2. Although mTORC2 has been implicated in mTORC1 activation, little is known about how mTORC2 is regulated. Here we report that phosphorylation of Sin1 at Thr\u00a086 and Thr\u00a0398 suppresses mTORC2 kinase activity by dissociating Sin1 from mTORC2. Importantly, Sin1 phosphorylation, triggered by S6K or Akt, in a cellular context-dependent manner, inhibits not only insulin- or IGF-1-mediated, but also PDGF- or EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation by mTORC2, demonstrating a negative regulation of mTORC2 independent of IRS-1 and Grb10. Finally, a cancer-patient-derived Sin1-R81T mutation impairs Sin1 phosphorylation, leading to hyper-activation of mTORC2 by bypassing this negative regulation. Together, our results reveal a Sin1-phosphorylation-dependent mTORC2 regulation, providing a potential molecular mechanism by which mutations in the mTORC1-S6K-Sin1 signalling axis might cause aberrant hyper-activation of the mTORC2-Akt pathway, which facilitates tumorigenesis.",

        "Abstract": "A large number of experimental and clinical studies have confirmed that brief remifentanil exposure can enhance pain sensitivity presenting as opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists have been reported to inhibit morphine analgesic tolerance in many studies. Recently, we found that glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) modulated NMDA receptor trafficking in a rat model of remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia. In the current study, it was demonstrated that GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition prevented remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia via regulating the expression and function of spinal NMDA receptors in vivo and in vitro. We firstly investigated the effects of TDZD-8, a selective GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor, on thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia using a rat model of remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia. GSK-3\u03b2 activity as well as NMDA receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A and NR2B) expression and trafficking in spinal cord L4-L5 segments were measured by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, the effects of GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition on NMDA-induced current amplitude and frequency were studied in spinal cord slices by whole-cell patch-clamp recording. We found that remifentanil infusion at 1 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) and 2 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) caused mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, up-regulated NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B expression in both membrane fraction and total lysate of the spinal cord dorsal horn and increased GSK-3\u03b2 activity in spinal cord dorsal horn. GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor TDZD-8 significantly attenuated remifentanil-induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia from 2 h to 48 h after infusion, and this was associated with reversal of up-regulated NR1 and NR2B subunits in both membrane fraction and total lysate. Furthermore, remifentanil incubation increased amplitude and frequency of NMDA receptor-induced current in dorsal horn neurons, which was prevented with the application of TDZD-8. These results suggest that inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2 can significantly ameliorate remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia via modulating the expression and function of NMDA receptors, which present useful insights into the mechanistic action of GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor as potential anti-hyperalgesic agents for treating OIH.",

        "Abstract": "Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as PARPs. We describe a method to characterize the human aspartic acid- and glutamic acid-ADP-ribosylated proteome. We identified 1,048 ADP-ribosylation sites on 340 proteins involved in a wide array of nuclear functions; among these were many previously unknown PARP downstream targets whose ADP-ribosylation was sensitive to PARP inhibitor treatment. We also confirmed that iniparib had a negligible effect on PARP activity in intact cells.",

The trafficking and activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors have a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia. However, the underlying mechanisms of hyperalgesia are poorly elucidated.

        "Title": "Combination therapy with molecular hydrogen and hyperoxia in a murine model of polymicrobial sepsis.",
        "Abstract": "Sepsis is the most common cause of death in intensive care units. Some studies have found that hyperoxia may be beneficial to sepsis. However, the clinical use of hyperoxia is hindered by concerns that it could exacerbate organ injury by increasing free radical formation. Recently, it has been suggested that molecular hydrogen (H2) at low concentration can exert a therapeutic antioxidant activity and effectively protect against sepsis by reducing oxidative stress. Therefore, we hypothesized that combination therapy with H2 and hyperoxia might afford more potent therapeutic strategies for sepsis. In the present study, we found that inhalation of H2 (2%) or hyperoxia (98%) alone improved the 14-day survival rate of septic mice with moderate cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) from 40% to 80% or 70%, respectively. However, combination therapy with H2 and hyperoxia could increase the 14-day survival rate of moderate CLP mice to 100% and improve the 7-day survival rate of severe CLP mice from 0% to 70%. Moreover, moderate CLP mice showed significant organ damage characterized by the increases in lung myeloperoxidase activity, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage, serum biochemical parameters (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen), and organ histopathological scores (lung, liver, and kidney), as well as the decrease in PaO2/FIO2 ratio at 24 h, which was attenuated by either H2 or hyperoxia alone. However, combination therapy with H2 and hyperoxia had a more beneficial effect against lung, liver, and kidney damage of moderate or severe CLP mice. Furthermore, we found that the beneficial effect of this combination therapy was associated with the decreased levels of oxidative product (8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1), increased activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (interleukin 10), and reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines (high-mobility group box 1 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1) in serum and tissues. Therefore, combination therapy with H2 and hyperoxia provides enhanced therapeutic efficacy via both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms and might be potentially a clinically feasible approach for sepsis.",

        "Abstract": "Hydrogen gas (H(2)) as a new medical gas exerts organ-protective effects through regulating oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. In contrast to H(2), hydrogen-rich saline (HS) may be more suitable for clinical application. The present study was designed to investigate whether HS can offer a neuroprotective effect in a rat model of permanent focal cerebral ischemia and what mechanism(s) underlies the effect. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent focal cerebral ischemia induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Different doses of HS or normal saline were intraperitoneally administered at 5min after pMCAO or sham operation followed by injections at 6h, 12h and 24h. Here, we found that HS treatment significantly reduced infarct volume and improved neurobehavioral outcomes at 24h, 48h and 72h after pMCAO operation in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). Moreover, we found that HS treatment dose-dependently increased the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT) as well as decreased the levels of oxidative products (8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 and MDA) and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and HMGB1) in injured ipsilateral brain tissues at 6h, 12h and 24h after pMCAO operation (P<0.05). Thus, hydrogen-rich saline dose-dependently exerts a neuroprotective effect against permanent focal cerebral ischemia, and its beneficial effect is at least partially mediated by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Molecular hydrogen may be an effective therapeutic strategy for stroke patients.",

        "Title": "Molecular hydrogen ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice through reducing inflammation and apoptosis.",
        "Abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is still a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Recently, our and other studies have found that hydrogen gas (H\u2082) treatment can ameliorate the lung injury induced by sepsis, ventilator, hyperoxia, and ischemia-reperfusion. However, the molecular mechanisms by which H\u2082 ameliorates lung injury remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated whether H\u2082 or hydrogen-rich saline (HS) could exert protective effects in a mouse model of ALI induced by intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via inhibiting the nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway-mediated inflammation and apoptosis. Two percent of H\u2082 was inhaled for 1 h beginning at 1 and 6 h after LPS administration, respectively. We found that LPS-challenged mice exhibited significant lung injury characterized by the deterioration of histopathology and histologic scores, wet-to-dry weight ratio, and oxygenation index (PaO\u2082/FIO\u2082), as well as total protein in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), which was attenuated by H\u2082 treatment. Hydrogen gas treatment inhibited LPS-induced pulmonary early and late NF-\u03baB activation. Moreover, H\u2082 treatment dramatically prevented the LPS-induced pulmonary cell apoptosis in LPS-challenged mice, as reflected by the decrease in TUNEL (deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) staining-positive cells and caspase 3 activity. Furthermore, H\u2082 treatment markedly attenuated LPS-induced lung neutrophil recruitment and inflammation, as evidenced by downregulation of lung myeloperoxidase activity, total cells, and polymorphonuclear neutrophils in BALF, as well as proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin 1\u03b2, interleukin 6, and high-mobility group box 1) and chemokines (keratinocyte-derived chemokine, macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP] 1\u03b1, MIP-2, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) in BALF. In addition, i.p. injection of 10 mL/kg hydrogen-rich saline also significantly attenuated the LPS-induced ALI. Collectively, these results demonstrate that molecular hydrogen treatment ameliorates LPS-induced ALI through reducing lung inflammation and apoptosis, which may be associated with the decreased NF-\u03baB activity. Hydrogen gas may be useful as a novel therapy to treat ALI. munosorbent assay; H\u2082-hydrogen gas; HMGB1-high-mobility group box 1; HS-hydrogen-rich saline; i.t.-intratracheal; KC-keratinocyte-derived chemokine; LPS-lipopolysaccharide; MCP-1-monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; MIP-1\u03b1-macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1; MIP-2-macrophage inflammatory protein 2; MPO-myeloperoxidase; PBS-phosphate-buffered saline; PMNs-polymorphonuclear neutrophils; TUNEL-deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling; W/D-wet-to-dry.",

Moderate cold stimulation can relieve pain, and this may be a novel train of thought for exploring new methods of analgesia.

        "Abstract": "The p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays a key role in cell growth and proliferation by regulating insulin sensitivity, metabolism, protein synthesis, and cell cycle. Thus, deregulation of S6K contributes to the progression of type 2 diabetes, obesity, aging, and cancer. Considering the biological and clinical importance of S6K1, a complete understanding of its regulation is critical. One of the key motifs in the activation of S6K1 is a turn motif, but its regulation is not well understood. Here we provide evidence for two mechanisms of modulating turn motif phosphorylation and S6K1 activity. First, mammalian target of rapamycin regulates turn motif phosphorylation by inhibiting its dephosphorylation. Second, we unexpectedly found that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 promotes turn motif phosphorylation. Our studies show that mammalian target of rapamycin and GSK-3 cooperate to control the activity of S6K1, an important regulator of cell proliferation and growth. Our unexpected results provide a clear rationale for the development and use of drugs targeting GSK-3 to treat diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and age-related diseases that are linked to improper regulation of S6K1.",

        "Abstract": "The evolutionarily conserved serine-threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a critical role in regulating many pathophysiological processes. Functional characterization of the mTOR signaling pathways, however, has been hampered by the paucity of known substrates. We used large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics experiments to define the signaling networks downstream of mTORC1 and mTORC2. Characterization of one mTORC1 substrate, the growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (Grb10), showed that mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation stabilized Grb10, leading to feedback inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular signal-regulated, mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK-MAPK) pathways. Grb10 expression is frequently down-regulated in various cancers, and loss of Grb10 and loss of the well-established tumor suppressor phosphatase PTEN appear to be mutually exclusive events, suggesting that Grb10 might be a tumor suppressor regulated by mTORC1.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, hydrogen gas (H\u2082) is reported to be a new therapeutic agent in organ damage induced by ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). The present study was designed to investigate the beneficial effects of H\u2082 against spinal cord I/R injury and its associated mechanisms. Spinal cord ischemia was induced by infrarenal aortic occlusion for 20 min in male New Zealand white rabbits. Treatment with 1%, 2% or 4% H\u2082 inhalation was given from 10 min before reperfusion to 60 min after reperfusion (total 70 min). Here, we found that I/R-challenged animals showed significant spinal cord damage characterized by the decreased numbers of normal motor neurons and hind-limb motor dysfunction, which was significantly improved by 2% and 4 % H\u2082 treatment. Furthermore, we found that the beneficial effects of H\u2082 treatment against spinal cord I/R injury were associated with the decreased levels of oxidative products [8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (8-iso-PGF2\u03b1) and malondialdehyde (MDA)] and pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)], as well as increased activities of antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)] in serum and spinal cord. In addition, H\u2082 treatment reduced motor neuron apoptosis in the spinal cord of this model. Thus, H\u2082 inhalation may be an effective therapeutic strategy for spinal cord I/R damage.",

        "Title": "Hydrogen gas improves survival rate and organ damage in zymosan-induced generalized inflammation model.",
        "Abstract": "Sepsis/multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients. Recently, it has been suggested that hydrogen gas (H2) exerts a therapeutic antioxidant activity by selectively reducing hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH, the most cytotoxic reactive oxygen species). We have found that H2 inhalation significantly improved the survival rate and organ damage of septic mice with moderate or severe cecal ligation and puncture. In the present study, we investigated the effects of 2% H2 treatment on survival rate and organ damage in zymosan (ZY)-induced generalized inflammation model. Here, we found that 2% H2 inhalation for 60 min starting at 1 and 6 h after ZY injection, respectively, significantly improved the 14-day survival rate of ZY-challenged mice from 10% to 70%. Furthermore, ZY-challenged mice showed significant multiple organ damage characterized by the increase in serum biochemical parameters (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine), as well as lung, liver, and kidney histopathological scores at 24 h after ZY injection, which was significantly attenuated by 2% H2 treatment. In addition, we found that the beneficial effects of H2 treatment on ZY-induced organ damage were associated with the decreased levels of oxidative product, increased activities of antioxidant enzyme, and reduced levels of early and late proinflammatory cytokines in serum and tissues. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that H2 treatment protects against multiple organ damages in ZY-induced generalized inflammation model, suggesting the potential use of H2 as a therapeutic agent in the therapy of conditions associated with inflammation-related multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "Despite recent advances in antibiotic therapy and intensive care, sepsis is still considered to be the most common cause of death in intensive care units. Excessive production of reactive oxygen species plays an important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Recently, it has been suggested that molecular hydrogen (H2) exerts a therapeutic antioxidant activity by selectively reducing hydroxyl radicals (*OH, the most cytotoxic reactive oxygen species) and effectively protects against organ damage induced by I/R. Therefore, we hypothesized that H2 treatment had a beneficial effect on sepsis. In the present study, we found that H2 inhalation starting at 1 and 6 h after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham operation significantly improved the survival rate of septic mice with moderate or severe CLP in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, moderate or severe CLP mice showed significant multiple organ damage characterized by the increases of lung myeloperoxidase activity, wet-to-dry weight ratio, protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage, serum biochemical parameters, and organ histopathologic scores at 24 h after CLP operation, which was significantly attenuated by 2% H2 treatment. In addition, we found that the beneficial effects of H2 treatment on sepsis and sepsis-associated organ damage were associated with the decreased levels of oxidative product, increased activities of antioxidant enzymes, and reduced levels of high-mobility group box 1 in serum and tissue. Thus, H2 inhalation may be an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with sepsis.",

        "Abstract": "Constitutive activation of one or more kinase signaling pathways is a hallmark of many cancers. Here we extend the previously described mass spectrometry-based KAYAK approach by monitoring kinase activities from multiple signaling pathways simultaneously. This improved single-reaction strategy, which quantifies the phosphorylation of 90 synthetic peptides in a single mass spectrometry run, is compatible with nanogram to microgram amounts of cell lysate. Furthermore, the approach enhances kinase monospecificity through substrate competition effects, faithfully reporting the signatures of many signaling pathways after mitogen stimulation or of basal pathway activation differences across a panel of well-studied cancer cell lines. Hierarchical clustering of activities from related experiments groups peptides phosphorylated by similar kinases together and, when combined with pathway alteration using pharmacological inhibitors, distinguishes underlying differences in potency, off-target effects and genetic backgrounds. Finally, we introduce a strategy to identify the kinase, and even associated protein complex members, responsible for phosphorylation events of interest.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether propofol could provide postconditioning to ischemic brain injury and the role of phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway in this phenomenon. Rats underwent 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 22 h of reperfusion were randomly divided into nine groups (n=15 each): sham-operated group, MCAO group, propofol 10, 20 and 35 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) group (propofol 10, 20, 35 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) infused at the onset of reperfusion for 30 min), wortmannin group (wortmannin 0.6 mg/kg administered 30 min before MCAO), and the other three groups received wortmannin followed by 10, 20 and 35 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) propofol respectively. Propofol at doses of 10 and 20 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) significantly reduced infarct volume, decreased neurological deficit scores and attenuated neuron apoptosis compared with MCAO group alone. Increased phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt) was observed in the ischemic penumbra of propofol 10 and 20 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) group after transient MCAO. The selective PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin partly eliminated the neuroprotective effect and the elevation of P-Akt expression in ischemic penumbra induced by propofol. Propofol at dose of 35 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) did not affect infarct volume, neurological deficit scores, neuronal apoptosis and the level of P-Akt in transient MCAO rats. Taken together, these results demonstrated that propofol at doses of 10 or 20 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) infused at the onset of reperfusion for 30 min could provide neuroprotection to transient MCAO rats, and the postconditioning effect induced by propofol partly through maintaining the activity of PI3K/Akt pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Most kinases are capable of recognizing and phosphorylating peptides containing short, linear sequence motifs. To measure the activation state of many kinases from the same cell lysate, we created a multiplexed, mass-spectrometry-based in vitro kinase assay. Ninety chemically synthesized peptides derived from well-characterized peptide substrates and in vivo phosphorylation sites with either known or previously unidentified upstream kinases were reacted individually in a plate format with crude cell lysates and ATP. Phosphorylation rates were directly measured based on the addition of 90 same-sequence, site-specific phosphopeptides enriched in stable isotopes to act as ideal quantitative internal standards for analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. This approach concurrently measured up to 90 site-specific peptide phosphorylation rates, reporting a diagnostic fingerprint for activated kinase pathways. We applied this unique kinome-activity profiling strategy in a variety of cellular settings, including mitogen stimulation, cell cycle, pharmacological inhibition of pathways, and to a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Finally, we identified the source of activity for a peptide (derived from a PI3K regulatory subunit) from our library. This peptide substrate demonstrated mitotic and tyrosine-specific phosphorylation, which was confirmed to be a novel Src family kinase site in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Chemokines participate in well documented interactions with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Although many chemokine amino acid residues involved in binding have been identified, much less is known about the bound regions of GAG. Heparan sulfate (HS) is the predominant cell surface GAG, and its heterogeneous nature offers proteins a variety of structural motifs with which to interact. In the present study, we describe the interactions of three CC chemokines, MCP-1/CCL2, MCP-2/CCL8, and MCP-3/CCL7, with HS-derived oligosaccharides. To this end, we generated and characterized a complex HS octasaccharide library containing 17 different octasaccharide compositions based on acetyl and sulfate group content. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used to detect chemokine-HS octasaccharide complexes in the bound state, and an affinity purification protocol was used to select and identify chemokine-binding octasaccharides from the complex mixture. The results indicate that HS octasaccharide sulfation is the foremost requirement for chemokine binding. However, within octasaccharides of constant charge density, acetylation is also observed to augment binding, suggesting that there may be as yet undiscovered specificity in the chemokine-HS interaction.",

We describe a subtractive strategy to determine the sites of tyrosine O-sulfation in proteins. Hydroxyl groups on unsulfated tyrosines are blocked by stoichiometric acetylation in a one-step reaction using sulfosuccinimidyl acetate (S-NHSAc) in the presence of imidazole at pH 7.0. The presence of sulfotyrosine is indicated by the detection of free tyrosine after tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis under conditions in which the sulfuryl group of sulfotyrosine is labile. Since phosphorylation and sulfation of tyrosine are isobaric, we used alkaline phosphatase treatment to distinguish these two modifications. Using this methodology we identified the sites and the order of sulfation of several peptides mediated by purified human tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases (TPSTs), and unambiguously determined the tyrosine sulfation sites in mouse lumican and human vitronectin.",

        "Title": "Heterodimerization of CCR2 chemokines and regulation by glycosaminoglycan binding.",
        "Abstract": "Despite the wide range of sequence diversity among chemokines, their tertiary structures are remarkably similar. Furthermore, many chemokines form dimers or higher order oligomers, but all characterized oligomeric structures are based primarily on two dimerization motifs represented by CC-chemokine or CXC-chemokine dimer interfaces. These observations raise the possibility that some chemokines could form unique hetero-oligomers using the same oligomerization motifs. Such interactions could modulate the overall signaling response of the receptors, thereby providing a general mechanism for regulating chemokine function. For some chemokines, homo-oligomerization has also been shown to be coupled to glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding. However, the effect of GAG binding on chemokine hetero-oligomerization has not yet been demonstrated. In this report, we characterized the heterodimerization of the CCR2 ligands MCP-1 (CCL2), MCP-2 (CCL8), MCP-3 (CCL7), MCP-4 (CCL13), and eotaxin (CCL11), as well as the effects of GAG binding, using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (ESI-FTICR) mass spectrometry. Strong heterodimerization was observed between CCL2 and CCL8 at the expense of homodimer formation. Using NMR, we showed that the heterodimer is predominant in solution and forms a specific CC chemokine-like dimer. By contrast, only moderate heterodimer formation was observed between CCL2.CCL13, CCL2.CCL11 and CCL8.CCL13, and no heterodimerization was observed when any other CCR2 ligand was added to CCL7. To investigate the effect of a highly sulfated GAG on the formation of heterodimers, each chemokine pair was mixed with the heparin pentasaccharide, Arixtra, and assayed by ESI-FTICR mass spectrometry. Although no CCL8.CCL11 heterodimer was observed in the absence of GAG, abundant ions corresponding to the ternary complex, CCL8.CCL11.Arixtra, were observed upon addition of Arixtra. Heterodimerization between CCL2 and CCL11 was also enhanced in the presence of Arixtra. In summary, these results indicate that some CCR2 ligands can form stable heterodimers in preference to homodimers and that these interactions, like those of homo-oligomers, can be influenced by some GAGs.",

        "Abstract": "Chemokine-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) interactions have been shown to be essential for in vivo chemokine signaling, which functions in such diverse processes as inflammation, development, and cancer metastasis. Despite the importance of these interactions, the saccharide sequence dependency of chemokine-GAG interactions is poorly understood. In a recent study, FT-ICR mass spectrometry was used to show that the chemokine CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) binds only to the 11- and 12-sulfated components of a heparin octasaccharide library. Although the exact structure of the fully sulfated, 12-sulfated octasaccharide is known, the 11-sulfated species could have a number of sulfated disaccharide sequences. In the current study, the composition of the 11-sulfated heparin octasaccharides, as well as the composition of CCL2 affinity purified 11-sulfated heparin octasaccharides, were examined by tandem MS. Of the three possible singly desulfated disaccharides, one species, III-S, is enriched by CCL2 affinity purification, indicating that the 11-sulfated heparin octasaccharides containing this disaccharide are preferentially bound to CCL2. These data suggest that 2-O and N sulfation of heparin may be of greater importance to CCL2-heparin binding than 6-O sulfation.",

        "Abstract": "Chemokines play a critical role in inducing chemotaxis, extravasation, and activation of leukocytes both in routine immunosurveillance and autoimmune diseases. Traditionally, to disrupt chemokine function, strategies have focused on blockage of its interaction with the receptor. Recently, it has been demonstrated that binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is also required for the in vivo activity of many chemokines. Thus, interference with the GAG-binding of chemokines may offer an alternative, valid, anti-inflammatory strategy. However, the potential of using small polyanions to inhibit the interactions between chemokines and cell surface GAGs has not been fully explored. In this study, a mass spectrometry based filtration trapping assay was utilized to study the interactions between two CCR 2 ligands (MCP-1/CCL2 and MCP-3/CCL7) and a series of low molecular weight, polyanionic molecules. Findings were confirmed by using a hydrophobic trapping assay. The results indicated that Arixtra (fondaparinux sodium), sucrose octasulfate, and suramin were specific binders of the chemokines, while cyclodextrin sulfate, although the most highly sulfated molecule among the ones investigated, showed no binding. The binding stoichiometry of the small molecule ligand was determined from the measured molecular weight of the noncovalent complex. Furthermore, the dissociation constant between MCP-3 and Arixtra was determined by using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (ESI FT-ICR) mass spectrometry, which compared favorably with the result of the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay. The relative binding affinity of these ligands to MCP-3 was also determined using a competitive filtration trapping assay.",

        "Abstract": "Electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (ESI-FTICR) mass spectrometry was used to study the noncovalent complexation of a metalloenzyme, phosphomannose isomerase (PMI), which catalyzes the interconversion of mannose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate. The zinc cofactor binding effect and the noncovalent interactions of the holoenzyme with its two natural substrates and two inhibitors, erythrose 4-phosphate and mannitol 1-phosphate, were investigated. Under nondenaturing conditions, the intact zinc-containing monomeric protein ions were reproducibly observed with no dissociation. Molecular ions corresponding to apo-PMI monomer were obtained by dialyzing the holoenzyme against EDTA. The binding/release of the metal ion did not alter the charge-state distributions of the protein to any significant extent, but changed the binding affinity of the substrates by at least 5-fold. Using ESI-FTICR mass spectrometry, the binding stoichiometry and specificity of the enzyme-substrate and enzyme-inhibitor complexes were directly determined. The first time report of the apparent dissociation constant for the isomeric substrates of PMI was measured to be 88.8 microM. The relative dissociation constant of the two inhibitors derived from gas-phase noncovalent complexation was very similar to the relative inhibition constant derived from solution phase kinetics.",

        "Abstract": "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) have recently been demonstrated to be required for the in vivo activity of several chemokines. Minimally, the interaction is thought to provide a mechanism for retention at the site of secretion and the formation of chemokine gradients that provide directional cues for receptor bearing cells, particularly in the presence of shear forces. Thus, a key issue will be to determine the sequence and structure of the GAGs that bind to specific chemokines. Herein, we describe a mass spectrometry assay that was developed to detect protein-oligosaccharide noncovalent complexes, in this case chemokine-GAG interactions, and to select for high affinity GAGs. The process is facilitated by the ability of electrospray ionization to transfer the intact noncovalent complexes from solution into the gas phase. The elemental composition as well as the binding stoichiometry can be calculated from the mass of the complex. Ligands of the chemokine receptor, CCR2 (MCP-1/CCL2, MCP-2/CCL8, MCP-3/CCL7, MCP-4/CCL13, and Eotaxin/CCL11), and the CCR10 ligand CTACK/CCL27 were screened against a small, highly sulfated, heparin oligosaccharide library with limited structural variation. The results revealed heparin octasaccharides with 11 and 12 sulfates as binders. Oligomerization of some chemokines was observed upon GAG binding, whereas in other instances only the monomeric noncovalent complex was identified. The results indicate that, in contrast to the apparent redundancy in the chemokine system, where several chemokines bind and activate the same receptor, these chemokines could be differentiated into two groups based on the stoichiometry of their complexes with the heparin oligosaccharides.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatitis C virus uses an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the viral RNA to directly recruit human 40S ribosome subunits during cap-independent translation initiation. Although IRES-mediated translation initiation is not subject to many of the regulatory mechanisms that control cap-dependent translation initiation, it is unknown whether other noncanonical protein factors are involved in this process. Thus, a global protein composition analysis of native and IRES-bound 40S ribosomal complexes has been conducted to facilitate an understanding of the IRES ribosome recruitment mechanism. A combined top-down and bottom-up mass spectrometry approach was used to identify both the proteins and their posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in the native 40S subunit and the IRES recruited translation initiation complex. Thirty-one out of a possible 32 ribosomal proteins were identified by combining top-down and bottom-up mass spectrometry techniques. Proteins were found to contain PTMs, including loss of methionine, acetylation, methylation, and disulfide bond formation. In addition to the 40S ribosomal proteins, RACK1 was consistently identified in the 40S fraction, indicating that this protein is associated with the 40S subunit. Similar methodology was then applied to the hepatitis C virus IRES-bound 40S complex. Two 40S ribosomal proteins, RS25 and RS29, were found to contain different PTMs than those in the native 40S subunit. In addition, RACK1, eukaryotic initiation factor 3 proteins and nucleolin were identified in the IRES-mediated translation initiation complex.",

        "Title": "Coordinated assembly of human translation initiation complexes by the hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site RNA.",
        "Abstract": "Protein synthesis in all cells begins with recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit to the initiation codon in a messenger RNA. In some eukaryotic viruses, RNA upstream of the coding region forms an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that directly binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit and enables translation initiation in the absence of many canonical translation initiation factors. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES RNA requires just two initiation factors, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 and eIF3, to form preinitiation 48S ribosomal complexes that subsequently assemble into translation-competent ribosomes. Using an RNA-based affinity purification approach, we show here that HCV IRES RNA facilitates eIF2 function through its interactions with eIF3 and the 40S ribosomal subunit. Although the wild-type IRES assembles normally into 48S and 80S ribosomal complexes in human cell extract, mutant IRES RNAs become trapped at the 48S assembly stage. Trapped 48S complexes formed by IRES mutants with reduced eIF3 binding affinity nonetheless contain eIF3, consistent with inherent eIF3-40S subunit affinity. Intriguingly, however, one of these IRES mutants prevents stable association of both eIF3 and eIF2, preventing initiator tRNA deposition and explaining the block in 80S assembly. In contrast, an IRES mutant unable to induce a conformational change in the 40S subunit, as observed previously by single-particle cryoelectron microscopy, blocks 80S formation at a later stage in assembly. These data suggest that the IRES RNA coordinates interactions of eIF3 and eIF2 on the ribosome required to position the initiator tRNA on the mRNA in the ribosomal peptidyl-tRNA site (P site).",

In addition, using isotopically labeled substrate, we have successfully confirmed a sulfated enzyme intermediate, which was predicted by the MS kinetic measurement. It is also shown that information regarding solution binding affinities can be obtained using electrospray ionization (ESI)-FTICR mass spectrometry. The relative binding constants, Kd(PAPS)/Kd(PAP), derived from the solution and gas phase were very similar, which suggests that the binding domain of this particular enzyme system, given known structures of other sulfotransferases, may be preserved during the transmission of the complex from solution to the gas phase.",

        "Abstract": "An efficient enzyme kinetics assay using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was initially applied to the catalytic mechanism investigation of a carbohydrate sulfotransferase, NodST. Herein, the recombinant NodST was overexpressed with a His(6)-tag and purified via Ni-NTA metal-affinity chromatography. In this bisubstrate enzymatic system, an internal standard similar in structure and ionization efficiency to the product was chosen in the ESI-MS assay, and a single point normalization factor was determined and used to quantify the product concentration. The catalytic mechanism of NodST was rapidly determined by fitting the MS kinetic data into a nonlinear regression analysis program. The initial rate kinetics analysis and product inhibition study described support a hybrid double-displacement, two-site ping-pong mechanism of NodST with formation of a sulfated NodST intermediate. This covalent intermediate was further isolated and detected via trypsin digestion and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. To our knowledge, these are the first mechanistic data reported for the bacterial sulfotransferase, NodST, which demonstrated the power of mass spectrometry in elucidating the reaction pathway and catalytic mechanism of promising enzymatic systems.",
