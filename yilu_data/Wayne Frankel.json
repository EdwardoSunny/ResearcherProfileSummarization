        "Abstract": "Heterozygous de novo loss-of-function mutations in the gene expression regulator HNRNPU cause an early-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. To gain insight into pathological mechanisms and lay the potential groundwork for developing targeted therapies, we characterized the neurophysiologic and cell-type-specific transcriptomic consequences of a mouse model of HNRNPU haploinsufficiency. Heterozygous mutants demonstrated global developmental delay, impaired ultrasonic vocalizations, cognitive dysfunction and increased seizure susceptibility, thus modeling aspects of the human disease. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of hippocampal and neocortical cells revealed widespread, yet modest, dysregulation of gene expression across mutant neuronal subtypes. We observed an increased burden of differentially-expressed genes in mutant excitatory neurons of the subiculum-a region of the hippocampus implicated in temporal lobe epilepsy. Evaluation of transcriptomic signature reversal as a therapeutic strategy highlights the potential importance of generating cell-type-specific signatures. Overall, this work provides insight into HNRNPU-mediated disease mechanisms and provides a framework for using single-cell RNA-sequencing to study transcriptional regulators implicated in disease.",

        "Abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a developmental disorder associated with epilepsy, autism, and cognitive impairment. Despite inactivating mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes and hyperactive mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, the mechanisms underlying TSC-associated neurological symptoms remain incompletely understood. Here we generate a Tsc1 conditional knockout (CKO) mouse model in which Tsc1 inactivation in late embryonic radial glia causes social and cognitive impairment and spontaneous seizures. Tsc1 depletion occurs in a subset of layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons, leading to development of cytomegalic pyramidal neurons (CPNs) that mimic dysplastic neurons in human TSC, featuring abnormal dendritic and axonal overgrowth, enhanced glutamatergic synaptic transmission, and increased susceptibility to seizure-like activities. We provide evidence that enhanced synaptic excitation in CPNs contributes to cortical hyperexcitability and epileptogenesis. In contrast, astrocytic regulation of synapse formation and synaptic transmission remains unchanged after late embryonic radial glial Tsc1 inactivation, and astrogliosis evolves secondary to seizures.",

        "Abstract": "While several studies have attributed the development of tumour-associated seizures to an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance, we have yet to resolve the spatiotemporal interplay between different types of neuron in glioma-infiltrated cortex. Herein, we combined methods for single unit analysis of microelectrode array recordings with wide-field optical mapping of Thy1-GCaMP pyramidal cells in an ex vivo acute slice model of diffusely infiltrating glioma. This enabled simultaneous tracking of individual neurons from both excitatory and inhibitory populations throughout seizure-like events. Moreover, our approach allowed for observation of how the crosstalk between these neurons varied spatially, as we recorded across an extended region of glioma-infiltrated cortex. In tumour-bearing slices, we observed marked alterations in single units classified as putative fast-spiking interneurons, including reduced firing, activity concentrated within excitatory bursts and deficits in local inhibition. These results were correlated with increases in overall excitability. Mechanistic perturbation of this system with the mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 revealed increased firing of putative fast-spiking interneurons and restoration of local inhibition, with concomitant decreases in overall excitability. Altogether, our findings suggest that diffusely infiltrating glioma affect the interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations in a reversible manner, highlighting a prominent role for functional mechanisms linked to mTOR activation.",

        "Abstract": "Paucity of the glucose transporter-1 (Glut1) protein resulting from haploinsufficiency of the SLC2A1 gene arrests cerebral angiogenesis and disrupts brain function to cause Glut1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1 DS). Restoring Glut1 to Glut1 DS model mice prevents disease, but the precise cellular sites of action of the transporter, its temporal requirements, and the mechanisms linking scarcity of the protein to brain cell dysfunction remain poorly understood. Here, we show that Glut1 functions in a cell-autonomous manner in the cerebral microvasculature to affect endothelial tip cells and, thus, brain angiogenesis. Moreover, brain endothelial cell-specific Glut1 depletion not only triggers a severe neuroinflammatory response in the Glut1 DS brain, but also reduces levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and causes overt disease. Reduced BDNF correlated with fewer neurons in the Glut1 DS brain. Controlled depletion of the protein demonstrated that brain pathology and disease severity was greatest when Glut1 scarcity was induced neonatally, during brain angiogenesis. Reducing Glut1 at later stages had mild or little effect. Our results suggest that targeting brain endothelial cells during early development is important to ensure proper brain angiogenesis, prevent neuroinflammation, maintain BDNF levels, and preserve neuron numbers. This requirement will be essential for any disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for Glut1 DS.",

        "Abstract": "NMDA receptors play crucial roles in excitatory synaptic transmission. Rare variants in GRIN2A encoding the GluN2A subunit are associated with a spectrum of disorders, ranging from mild speech and language delay to intractable neurodevelopmental disorders, including but not limited to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. A de novo missense variant, p.Ser644Gly, was identified in a child with this disorder, and Grin2a knock-in mice were generated to model and extend understanding of this intractable childhood disease. Homozygous and heterozygous mutant mice exhibited altered hippocampal morphology at 2 weeks of age, and all homozygotes exhibited lethal tonic-clonic seizures by mid-third week. Heterozygous adults displayed susceptibility to induced generalized seizures, hyperactivity, repetitive and reduced anxiety behaviours, plus several unexpected features, including significant resistance to electrically-induced limbic seizures and to pentylenetetrazole induced tonic-clonic seizures. Multielectrode recordings of neuronal networks revealed hyperexcitability and altered bursting and synchronicity. In heterologous cells, mutant receptors had enhanced NMDA receptor agonist potency and slow deactivation following rapid removal of glutamate, as occurs at synapses. NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents in heterozygous hippocampal slices also showed a prolonged deactivation time course. Standard anti-epileptic drug monotherapy was ineffective in the patient. Introduction of NMDA receptor antagonists was correlated with a decrease in seizure burden. Chronic treatment of homozygous mouse pups with NMDA receptor antagonists significantly delayed the onset of lethal seizures but did not prevent them. These studies illustrate the power of using multiple experimental modalities to model and test therapies for severe neurodevelopmental disorders, while revealing significant biological complexities associated with GRIN2A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.",

        "Abstract": "Excessive excitation is hypothesized to cause motoneuron (MN) degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but actual proof of hyperexcitation in vivo is missing, and trials based on this concept have failed. We demonstrate, by in vivo single-MN electrophysiology, that, contrary to expectations, excitatory responses evoked by sensory and brainstem inputs are reduced in MNs of presymptomatic mutSOD1 mice. This impairment correlates with disrupted postsynaptic clustering of Homer1b, Shank, and AMPAR subunits. Synaptic restoration can be achieved by activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway, by either intracellular injection of cAMP or DREADD-Gs stimulation. Furthermore, we reveal, through independent control of signaling and excitability allowed by multiplexed DREADD/PSAM chemogenetics, that PKA-induced restoration of synapses triggers an excitation-dependent decrease in misfolded SOD1 burden and autophagy overload. In turn, increased MN excitability contributes to restoring synaptic structures. Thus, the decrease of excitation to MN is an early but reversible event in ALS. Failure of the postsynaptic site, rather than hyperexcitation, drives disease pathobiochemistry.",

        "Abstract": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) associated with de novo variants in the gene encoding dynamin-1 (DNM1) is a severe debilitating disease with no pharmacological remedy. Like most genetic DEEs, the majority of DNM1 patients suffer from therapy-resistant seizures and comorbidities such as intellectual disability, developmental delay, and hypotonia. We tested RNAi gene therapy in the Dnm1 fitful mouse model of DEE using a Dnm1-targeted therapeutic microRNA delivered by a self-complementary adeno-associated virus vector. Untreated or control-injected fitful mice have growth delay, severe ataxia, and lethal tonic-clonic seizures by 3\u00a0weeks of age. These major impairments are mitigated following a single treatment in newborn mice, along with key underlying cellular features including gliosis, cell death, and aberrant neuronal metabolic activity typically associated with recurrent seizures. Our results underscore the potential for RNAi gene therapy to treat DNM1 disease and other genetic DEEs where treatment would require inhibition of the pathogenic gene product.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in the X-linked gene IQSEC2 are associated with multiple cases of epilepsy, epileptic encephalopathy, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, the mechanistic understanding and successful treatment of which remain a significant challenge in IQSEC2 and related neurodevelopmental genetic diseases. To investigate disease etiology, we studied behaviors and synaptic function in IQSEC2 deficient mice. Hemizygous Iqsec2 null males exhibit growth deficits, hyperambulation and hyperanxiety phenotypes. Adult hemizygotes experience lethal spontaneous seizures, but paradoxically have a significantly increased threshold to electrically induced limbic seizures and relative resistance to chemically induced seizures. Although there are no gross defects in brain morphology, hemizygotes exhibit stark hippocampal reactive astrogliosis. Electrophysiological recordings of hippocampal neurons reveal increased excitatory drive specifically onto interneurons, and significant alterations in intrinsic electrical properties specific to the interneuron population. As they age, hemizygotes also develop an increased abundance of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the hippocampus, neurons in which IQSEC2 is expressed in addition to the excitatory neurons. These findings point to a novel role of IQSEC2 in hippocampal interneuron synaptic function and development with implications for a class of intractable neurodevelopmental diseases.",

        "Abstract": "RNA-protein interaction plays important roles in post-transcriptional regulation. Recent advancements in cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (CLIP-seq) technologies make it possible to detect the binding peaks of a given RNA binding protein (RBP) at transcriptome scale. However, it is still challenging to predict the functional consequences of RBP binding peaks. In this study, we propose the Protein-RNA Association Strength (PRAS), which integrates the intensities and positions of the binding peaks of RBPs for functional mRNA targets prediction. We illustrate the superiority of PRAS over existing approaches on predicting the functional targets of two related but divergent CELF (CUGBP, ELAV-like factor) RBPs in mouse brain and muscle. We also demonstrate the potential of PRAS for wide adoption by applying it to the enhanced CLIP-seq (eCLIP) datasets of 37 RNA decay related RBPs in two human cell lines. PRAS can be utilized to investigate any RBPs with available CLIP-seq peaks. PRAS is freely available at http://ouyanglab.jax.org/pras/.",

        "Abstract": "Here we present an open-source R package 'meaRtools' that provides a platform for analyzing neuronal networks recorded on Microelectrode Arrays (MEAs). Cultured neuronal networks monitored with MEAs are now being widely used to characterize in vitro models of neurological disorders and to evaluate pharmaceutical compounds. meaRtools provides core algorithms for MEA spike train analysis, feature extraction, statistical analysis and plotting of multiple MEA recordings with multiple genotypes and treatments. meaRtools functionality covers novel solutions for spike train analysis, including algorithms to assess electrode cross-correlation using the spike train tiling coefficient (STTC), mutual information, synchronized bursts and entropy within cultured wells. Also integrated is a solution to account for bursts variability originating from mixed-cell neuronal cultures. The package provides a statistical platform built specifically for MEA data that can combine multiple MEA recordings and compare extracted features between different genetic models or treatments. We demonstrate the utilization of meaRtools to successfully identify epilepsy-like phenotypes in neuronal networks from Celf4 knockout mice. The package is freely available under the GPL license (GPL> = 3) and is updated frequently on the CRAN web-server repository. The package, along with full documentation can be downloaded from: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meaRtools/.",

        "Title": "KICSTOR recruits GATOR1 to the lysosome and is necessary for nutrients to regulate mTORC1.",
        "Abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central regulator of cell growth that responds to diverse environmental signals and is deregulated in many human diseases, including cancer and epilepsy. Amino acids are a key input to this system, and act through the Rag GTPases to promote the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. Multiple protein complexes regulate the Rag GTPases in response to amino acids, including GATOR1, a GTPase activating protein for RAGA, and GATOR2, a positive regulator of unknown molecular function. Here we identify a protein complex (KICSTOR) that is composed of four proteins, KPTN, ITFG2, C12orf66 and SZT2, and that is required for amino acid or glucose deprivation to inhibit mTORC1 in cultured human cells. In mice that lack SZT2, mTORC1 signalling is increased in several tissues, including in neurons in the brain. KICSTOR localizes to lysosomes; binds and recruits GATOR1, but not GATOR2, to the lysosomal surface; and is necessary for the interaction of GATOR1 with its substrates, the Rag GTPases, and with GATOR2. Notably, several KICSTOR components are mutated in neurological diseases associated with mutations that lead to hyperactive mTORC1 signalling. Thus, KICSTOR is a lysosome-associated negative regulator of mTORC1 signalling, which, like GATOR1, is mutated in human disease.",

        "Abstract": "Cultured neuronal networks monitored with microelectrode arrays (MEAs) have been used widely to evaluate pharmaceutical compounds for potential neurotoxic effects. A newer application of MEAs has been in the development of in vitro models of neurological disease. Here, we directly evaluated the utility of MEAs to recapitulate in vivo phenotypes of mature microRNA-128 (miR-128) deficiency, which causes fatal seizures in mice. We show that inhibition of miR-128 results in significantly increased neuronal activity in cultured neuronal networks derived from primary mouse cortical neurons. These results support the utility of MEAs in developing in vitro models of neuroexcitability disorders, such as epilepsy, and further suggest that MEAs provide an effective tool for the rapid identification of microRNAs that promote seizures when dysregulated.",

        "Title": "Dynamin 1 isoform roles in a mouse model of severe childhood epileptic encephalopathy.",
        "Abstract": "Dynamin 1 is a large neuron-specific GTPase involved in the endocytosis and recycling of pre-synaptic membranes and synaptic vesicles. Mutations in the gene encoding dynamin 1 (DNM1) underlie two epileptic encephalopathy syndromes, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Infantile Spasms. Mice homozygous for the Dnm1 \"fitful\" mutation, a non-synonymous coding variant in an alternatively spliced exon of Dnm1 (exon 10a; isoform designation: Dnm1a(Ftfl)) have an epileptic encephalopathy-like disorder including lethal early onset seizures, locomotor and neurosensory deficits. Although fitful heterozygotes have milder recurrent seizures later in life, suggesting an additive or semi-dominant mechanism, the molecular etiology must also consider the fact that Dnm1a(Ftfl) exerts a dominant negative effect on endocytosis in vitro. Another complication is that the fitful mutation induces alterations in the relative abundance of Dnm1 splice variants; mutants have a downregulation of Dnm1a and an upregulation of Dnm1b, changes which may contribute to the epileptic pathology. To examine whether Dnm1a loss of function, Dnm1a(Ftfl) dominance or compensation by Dnm1b is the most critical for severe seizures, we studied alternate isoform-specific mutant mice. Mice lacking Dnm1 exon 10a or Dnm1 exon 10b have neither spontaneous seizures nor other overt abnormalities, suggesting that in normal conditions the major role of each isoform is redundant. However, in the presence of Dnm1a(Ftfl) only exon 10a deleted mice experience severe seizures. These results reveal functional differences between Dnm1a and Dnm1b isoforms in the presence of a challenge, i.e. toxic Dnm1(Ftfl), while reinforcing its effect explicitly in this model of severe pediatric epilepsy.",

        "Abstract": "The childhood epileptic encephalopathies (EE's) are seizure disorders that broadly impact development including cognitive, sensory and motor progress with severe consequences and comorbidities. Recently, mutations in DNM1 (dynamin 1) have been implicated in two EE syndromes, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Infantile Spasms. Dnm1 encodes dynamin 1, a large multimeric GTPase necessary for activity-dependent membrane recycling in neurons, including synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Dnm1Ftfl or \"fitful\" mice carry a spontaneous mutation in the mouse ortholog of DNM1 and recapitulate many of the disease features associated with human DNM1 patients, providing a relevant disease model of human EE's. In order to examine the cellular etiology of seizures and behavioral and neurological comorbidities, we engineered a conditional Dnm1Ftfl mouse model of DNM1 EE. Observations of Dnm1Ftfl/flox mice in combination with various neuronal subpopulation specific cre strains demonstrate unique seizure phenotypes and clear separation of major neurobehavioral comorbidities from severe seizures associated with the germline model. This demonstration of pleiotropy suggests that treating seizures per se may not prevent severe comorbidity observed in EE associated with dynamin-1 mutations, and is likely to have implications for other genetic forms of EE.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia in the elderly and is characterized by amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuronal dysfunction. Early onset AD (EOAD) is commonly caused by mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) or genes involved in the processing of APP including the presenilins (e.g. PSEN1 or PSEN2). In general, mouse models relevant to EOAD recapitulate amyloidosis, show only limited amounts of NFTs and neuronal cell dysfunction and low but significant levels of seizure susceptibility. To investigate the effect of genetic background on these phenotypes, we generated APPswe and PSEN1de9 transgenic mice on the seizure prone inbred strain background, DBA/2J. Previous studies show that the DBA/2J genetic background modifies plaque deposition in the presence of mutant APP but the impact of PSEN1de9 has not been tested. Our study shows that DBA/2J.APPswePSEN1de9 mice are significantly more prone to premature lethality, likely to due to lethal seizures, compared to B6.APPswePSEN1de9 mice-70% of DBA/2J.APPswePSEN1de9 mice die between 2-3 months of age. Of the DBA/2J.APPswePSEN1de9 mice that survived to 6 months of age, plaque deposition was greatly reduced compared to age-matched B6.APPswePSEN1de9 mice. The reduction in plaque deposition appears to be independent of microglia numbers, reactive astrocytosis and complement C5 activity.",

        "Title": "Unraveling genetic modifiers in the gria4 mouse model of absence epilepsy.",
        "Abstract": "Absence epilepsy (AE) is a common type of genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE), particularly in children. AE and GGE are complex genetic diseases with few causal variants identified to date. Gria4 deficient mice provide a model of AE, one for which the common laboratory inbred strain C3H/HeJ (HeJ) harbors a natural IAP retrotransposon insertion in Gria4 that reduces its expression 8-fold. Between C3H and non-seizing strains such as C57BL/6, genetic modifiers alter disease severity. Even C3H substrains have surprising variation in the duration and incidence of spike-wave discharges (SWD), the characteristic electroencephalographic feature of absence seizures. Here we discovered extensive IAP retrotransposition in the C3H substrain, and identified a HeJ-private IAP in the Pcnxl2 gene, which encodes a putative multi-transmembrane protein of unknown function, resulting in decreased expression. By creating new Pcnxl2 frameshift alleles using TALEN mutagenesis, we show that Pcnxl2 deficiency is responsible for mitigating the seizure phenotype - making Pcnxl2 the first known modifier gene for absence seizures in any species. This finding gave us a handle on genetic complexity between strains, directing us to use another C3H substrain to map additional modifiers including validation of a Chr 15 locus that profoundly affects the severity of SWD episodes. Together these new findings expand our knowledge of how natural variation modulates seizures, and highlights the feasibility of characterizing and validating modifiers in mouse strains and substrains in the post-genome sequence era.",

Many antiepileptic drugs target NaV channels and modulate neuronal excitability, mainly by a use-dependent block of transient sodium current, although suppression of persistent current may also contribute to the efficacy of these drugs. We hypothesized that a drug or compound capable of preferential inhibition of persistent sodium current would have antiepileptic activity.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations of MECP2 cause Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurodevelopmental disorder leading to loss of motor and cognitive functions, impaired social interactions, and seizure at young ages. Defects of neuronal circuit development and function are thought to be responsible for the symptoms of RTT. The majority of RTT patients show recurrent seizures, indicating that neuronal hyperexcitation is a common feature of RTT. However, mechanisms underlying hyperexcitation in RTT are poorly understood. Here we show that deletion of Mecp2 from cortical excitatory neurons but not forebrain inhibitory neurons in the mouse leads to spontaneous seizures. Selective deletion of Mecp2 from excitatory but not inhibitory neurons in the forebrain reduces GABAergic transmission in layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal and somatosensory cortices. Loss of MeCP2 from cortical excitatory neurons reduces the number of GABAergic synapses in the cortex, and enhances the excitability of layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Using single-cell deletion of Mecp2 in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, we show that GABAergic transmission is reduced in neurons without MeCP2, but is normal in neighboring neurons with MeCP2. Together, these results suggest that MeCP2 in cortical excitatory neurons plays a critical role in the regulation of GABAergic transmission and cortical excitability.",

        "Title": "Modes and regulation of endocytic membrane retrieval in mouse auditory hair cells.",
        "Abstract": "Synaptic vesicle recycling sustains high rates of neurotransmission at the ribbon-type active zones (AZs) of mouse auditory inner hair cells (IHCs), but its modes and molecular regulation are poorly understood. Electron microscopy indicated the presence of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and bulk endocytosis. The endocytic proteins dynamin, clathrin, and amphiphysin are expressed and broadly distributed in IHCs. We used confocal vglut1-pHluorin imaging and membrane capacitance (Cm) measurements to study the spatial organization and dynamics of IHC exocytosis and endocytosis. Viral gene transfer expressed vglut1-pHluorin in IHCs and targeted it to synaptic vesicles. The intravesicular pH was \u223c6.5, supporting only a modest increase of vglut1-pHluorin fluorescence during exocytosis and pH neutralization. Ca(2+) influx triggered an exocytic increase of vglut1-pHluorin fluorescence at the AZs, around which it remained for several seconds. The endocytic Cm decline proceeded with constant rate (linear component) after exocytosis of the readily releasable pool (RRP). When exocytosis exceeded three to four RRP equivalents, IHCs additionally recruited a faster Cm decline (exponential component) that increased with the amount of preceding exocytosis and likely reflects bulk endocytosis. The dynamin inhibitor Dyngo-4a and the clathrin blocker pitstop 2 selectively impaired the linear component of endocytic Cm decline. A missense mutation of dynamin 1 (fitful) inhibited endocytosis to a similar extent as Dyngo-4a. We propose that IHCs use dynamin-dependent endocytosis via CME to support vesicle cycling during mild stimulation but recruit bulk endocytosis to balance massive exocytosis.",

        "Title": "Elevated Id2 expression results in precocious neural stem cell depletion and abnormal brain development.",
        "Abstract": "Id2 is a helix-loop-helix transcription factor essential for normal development, and its expression is dysregulated in many human neurological conditions. Although it is speculated that elevated Id2 levels contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders, it is unknown whether dysregulated Id2 expression is sufficient to perturb normal brain development or function. Here, we show that mice with elevated Id2 expression during embryonic stages develop microcephaly, and that females in particular are prone to generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Analyses of Id2 transgenic brains indicate that Id2 activity is highly cell context specific: elevated Id2 expression in naive neural stem cells (NSCs) in early neuroepithelium induces apoptosis and loss of NSCs and intermediate progenitors. Activation of Id2 in maturing neuroepithelium results in less severe phenotypes and is accompanied by elevation of G1 cyclin expression and p53 target gene expression. In contrast, activation of Id2 in committed intermediate progenitors has no significant phenotype. Functional analysis with Id2-overexpressing and Id2-null NSCs shows that Id2 negatively regulates NSC self-renewal in vivo, in contrast to previous cell culture experiments. Deletion of p53 function from Id2-transgenic brains rescues apoptosis and results in increased incidence of brain tumors. Furthermore, Id2 overexpression normalizes the increased self-renewal of p53-null NSCs, suggesting that Id2 activates and modulates the p53 pathway in NSCs. Together, these data suggest that elevated Id2 expression in embryonic brains can cause deregulated NSC self-renewal, differentiation, and survival that manifest in multiple neurological outcomes in mature brains, including microcephaly, seizures, and brain tumors.",

        "Title": "CELF4 regulates translation and local abundance of a vast set of mRNAs, including genes associated with regulation of synaptic function.",
        "Abstract": "RNA-binding proteins have emerged as causal agents of complex neurological diseases. Mice deficient for neuronal RNA-binding protein CELF4 have a complex neurological disorder with epilepsy as a prominent feature. Human CELF4 has recently been associated with clinical features similar to those seen in mutant mice. CELF4 is expressed primarily in excitatory neurons, including large pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and it regulates excitatory but not inhibitory neurotransmission. We examined mechanisms underlying neuronal hyperexcitability in Celf4 mutants by identifying CELF4 target mRNAs and assessing their fate in the absence of CELF4 in view of their known functions. CELF4 binds to at least 15%-20% of the transcriptome, with striking specificity for the mRNA 3' untranslated region. CELF4 mRNA targets encode a variety of proteins, many of which are well established in neuron development and function. While the overall abundance of these mRNA targets is often dysregulated in Celf4 deficient mice, the actual expression changes are modest at the steady-state level. In contrast, by examining the transcriptome of polysome fractions and the mRNA distribution along the neuronal cell body-neuropil axis, we found that CELF4 is critical for maintaining mRNA stability and availability for translation. Among biological processes associated with CELF4 targets that accumulate in neuropil of mutants, regulation of synaptic plasticity and transmission are the most prominent. Together with a related study of the impact of CELF4 loss on sodium channel Na(v)1.6 function, we suggest that CELF4 deficiency leads to abnormal neuronal function by combining a specific effect on neuronal excitation with a general impairment of synaptic transmission. These results also expand our understanding of the vital roles RNA-binding proteins play in regulating and shaping the activity of neural circuits.",

        "Abstract": "Mice deficient for CELF4, a neuronal RNA-binding protein, have a complex seizure disorder that includes both convulsive and non-convulsive seizures, and is dependent upon Celf4 gene dosage and mouse strain background. It was previously shown that Celf4 is expressed predominantly in excitatory neurons, and that deficiency results in abnormal excitatory synaptic neurotransmission. To examine the physiological and molecular basis of this, we studied Celf4-deficient neurons in brain slices. Assessment of intrinsic properties of layer V cortical pyramidal neurons showed that neurons from mutant heterozygotes and homozygotes have a lower action potential (AP) initiation threshold and a larger AP gain when compared with wild-type neurons. Celf4 mutant neurons also demonstrate an increase in persistent sodium current (I(NaP)) and a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation. As part of a related study, we find that CELF4 directly binds Scn8a mRNA, encoding sodium channel Na(v)1.6, the primary instigator of AP at the axon initial segment (AIS) and the main carrier of I(NaP). In the present study we find that CELF4 deficiency results in a dramatic elevation in the expression of Na(v)1.6 protein at the AIS in both null and heterozygous neurons. Together these results suggest that activation of Na(v)1.6 plays a crucial role in seizure generation in this complex model of neurological disease.",

        "Abstract": "Cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits mediate sensation and generate neural network oscillations associated with slow-wave sleep and various epilepsies. Cortical input to sensory thalamus is thought to mainly evoke feed-forward synaptic inhibition of thalamocortical (TC) cells via reticular thalamic nucleus (nRT) neurons, especially during oscillations. This relies on a stronger synaptic strength in the cortico-nRT pathway than in the cortico-TC pathway, allowing the feed-forward inhibition of TC cells to overcome direct cortico-TC excitation. We found a systemic and specific reduction in strength in GluA4-deficient (Gria4(-/-)) mice of one excitatory synapse of the rhythmogenic cortico-thalamo-cortical system, the cortico-nRT projection, and observed that the oscillations could still be initiated by cortical inputs via the cortico-TC-nRT-TC pathway. These results reveal a previously unknown mode of cortico-thalamo-cortical transmission, bypassing direct cortico-nRT excitation, and describe a mechanism for pathological oscillation generation.

        "Title": "A novel Akt3 mutation associated with enhanced kinase activity and seizure susceptibility in mice.",
        "Abstract": "In a phenotype-driven mutagenesis screen, a novel, dominant mouse mutation, Nmf350, caused low seizure threshold, sporadic tonic-clonic seizures, brain enlargement and ectopic neurons in the dentate hilus and molecular layer of the hippocampus. Genetic mapping implicated Akt3, one of four candidates within the critical interval. Sequencing analysis revealed that mutants have a missense mutation in Akt3 (encoding one of three AKT/protein kinase B molecules), leading to a non-synonymous amino acid substitution in the highly conserved protein kinase domain. Previous knockout studies showed that Akt3 is pivotal in postnatal brain development, including a smaller brain, although seizures were not observed. In contrast to Akt3(Nmf350), we find that Akt3 null mice exhibit an elevated seizure threshold. An in vitro kinase assay revealed that Akt3(Nmf350) confers higher enzymatic activity, suggesting that Akt3(Nmf350) might enhance AKT signaling in the brain. In the dentate gyrus of Akt3(Nmf350) homozygotes, we also observed a modest increase in immunoreactivity of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6, an AKT pathway downstream target. Together these findings suggest that Akt3(Nmf350) confers an increase of AKT3 activity in specific neuronal populations in the brain, and a unique dominant phenotype. Akt3(Nmf350) mice provide a new tool for studying physiological roles of AKT signaling in the brain, and potentially novel mechanisms for epilepsy.",

        "Title": "Neuronal voltage-gated ion channels are genetic modifiers of generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus.",
        "Abstract": "Mutations in the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel genes SCN1A and SCN2A are associated with inherited epilepsies, including genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and Dravet syndrome (severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy). The clinical presentation and severity of these epilepsies vary widely, even in people with the same mutation, suggesting the action of environmental or genetic modifiers. To gain support for the hypothesis that genetic modifiers can influence clinical presentation in patients with SCN1A-derived GEFS+, we used mouse models to study the effect of combining the human GEFS+ mutation SCN1A-R1648H with SCN2A, KCNQ2, and SCN8A mutations. Knock-in mice heterozygous for the R1648H mutation (Scn1a(RH/+)) have decreased thresholds to induced seizures and infrequent spontaneous seizures, whereas homozygotes display spontaneous seizures and premature lethality. Scn2a(Q54) transgenic mice have a mutation in Scn2a that results in spontaneous, adult-onset partial motor seizures, and mice carrying the Kcnq2-V182M mutation exhibit increased susceptibility to induced seizures, and rare spontaneous seizures as adults. Combining the Scn1a-R1648H allele with either Scn2a(Q54) or Kcnq2(V182M/+) results in early-onset, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and juvenile lethality in double heterozygous mice. In contrast, Scn8a mutants exhibit increased resistance to induced seizures. Combining the Scn1a-R1648H and Scn8a-med-jo alleles restores normal thresholds to flurothyl-induced seizures in Scn1a(RH/+) heterozygotes and improved survival of Scn1a(RH/RH) homozygotes. Our results demonstrate that variants in Scn2a, Kcnq2, and Scn8a can dramatically influence the phenotype of mice carrying the Scn1a-R1648H mutation and suggest that ion channel variants may contribute to the clinical variation seen in patients with monogenic epilepsy.",

        "Abstract": "Dynamin-1 (Dnm1) encodes a large multimeric GTPase necessary for activity-dependent membrane recycling in neurons, including synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Mice heterozygous for a novel spontaneous Dnm1 mutation--fitful--experience recurrent seizures, and homozygotes have more debilitating, often lethal seizures in addition to severe ataxia and neurosensory deficits. Fitful is a missense mutation in an exon that defines the DNM1a isoform, leaving intact the alternatively spliced exon that encodes DNM1b. The expression of the corresponding alternate transcripts is developmentally regulated, with DNM1b expression highest during early neuronal development and DNM1a expression increasing postnatally with synaptic maturation. Mutant DNM1a does not efficiently self-assemble into higher order complexes known to be necessary for proper dynamin function, and it also interferes with endocytic recycling in cell culture. In mice, the mutation results in defective synaptic transmission characterized by a slower recovery from depression after trains of stimulation. The DNM1a and DNM1b isoform pair is highly conserved in vertebrate evolution, whereas invertebrates have only one isoform. We speculate that the emergence of more specialized forms of DNM1 may be important in organisms with complex neuronal function.",

        "Abstract": "Currently, approximately 20 genetic variants are known to cause Mendelian forms of human epilepsy, leaving a vast heritability undefined. Rodent models for genetically complex epilepsy have been studied for many years, but only recently have strong candidate genes emerged, including Cacna1 g in the GAERS rat model of absence epilepsy and Kcnj10 in the low seizure threshold of DBA/2 mice. In parallel, a growing number of mouse mutations studied on multiple strain backgrounds reveal the impact of genetic modifiers on seizure severity, incidence or form--perhaps mimicking the complexity seen in humans. The field of experimental genetics in rodents is poised to study discrete epilepsy mutations on a diverse choice of strain backgrounds to develop better models and identify modifiers. But, it must find the right balance between embracing the strain diversity available, with the ability to detect and characterize genetic effects. Using alternative strain backgrounds when studying epilepsy mutations will enhance the modeling of epilepsy as a complex genetic disease.",

Mouse strain background had a significant effect on SWD, with mutants on the C3HeB/FeJ strain showing a higher incidence than on C57BL/6J.

        "Abstract": "The auxiliary spliceosomal protein SCNM1 contributes to recognition of nonconsensus splice donor sites. SCNM1 was first identified as a modifier of the severity of a sodium channelopathy in the mouse. The most severely affected strain, C57BL/6J, carries the variant allele SCNM1R187X, which is defective in splicing the mutated donor site in the Scn8a(medJ) transcript. To further probe the in vivo function of SCNM1, we constructed a floxed allele and generated a mouse with constitutive deletion of exons 3-5. The SCNM1Delta3-5 protein is produced and correctly localized to the nucleus, but is more functionally impaired than the C57BL/6J allele. Deficiency of SCNM1 did not significantly alter other brain transcripts. We characterized an ENU-induced allele of Scnm1 and evaluated the ability of wild-type SCNM1 to rescue lethal mutations of I-mfa and Brunol4. The phenotypes of the Scnm1Delta3-5 mutant confirm the role of this splice factor in processing the Scn8a(medJ) transcript and provide a new allele of greater severity for future studies.",

        "Abstract": "Absence epilepsy, characterized by spike-wave discharges (SWD) in the electroencephalogram, arises from aberrations within the circuitry of the cerebral cortex and thalamus that regulates awareness. The inbred mouse strain C3H/HeJ is prone to absence seizures, with a major susceptibility locus, spkw1, accounting for most of the phenotype. Here we find that spkw1 is associated with a hypomorphic retroviral-like insertion mutation in the Gria4 gene, encoding one of the four amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunits in the brain. Consistent with this, Gria4 knockout mice also have frequent SWD and do not complement spkw1. In contrast, null mutants for the related gene Gria3 do not have SWD, and Gria3 loss actually lowers SWD of spkw1 homozygotes. Gria3 and Gria4 encode the predominant AMPA receptor subunits in the reticular thalamus, which is thought to play a central role in seizure genesis by inhibiting thalamic relay cells and promoting rebound burst firing responses. In Gria4 mutants, synaptic excitation of inhibitory reticular thalamic neurons is enhanced, with increased duration of synaptic responses-consistent with what might be expected from reduction of the kinetically faster subunit of AMPA receptors encoded by Gria4. These results demonstrate for the first time an essential role for Gria4 in the brain, and suggest that abnormal AMPA receptor-dependent synaptic activity can be involved in the network hypersynchrony that underlies absence seizures.",

        "Abstract": "Idiopathic epilepsy is a common human disorder with a strong genetic component, usually exhibiting complex inheritance. We describe a new mouse mutation in C57BL/6J mice, called frequent-flyer (Ff), in which disruption of the gene encoding RNA-binding protein Bruno-like 4 (Brunol4) leads to limbic and severe tonic-clonic seizures in heterozygous mutants beginning in their third month. Younger heterozygous adults have a reduced seizure threshold. Although homozygotes do not survive well on the C57BL/6J background, on mixed backgrounds homozygotes and some heterozygotes also display spike-wave discharges, the electroencephalographic manifestation of absence epilepsy. Brunol4 is widely expressed in the brain with enrichment in the hippocampus. Gene expression profiling and subsequent analysis revealed the down-regulation of at least four RNA molecules encoding proteins known to be involved in neuroexcitability, particularly in mutant hippocampus. Genetic and phenotypic assessment suggests that Brunol4 deficiency in mice results in a complex seizure phenotype, likely due to the coordinate dysregulation of several molecules, providing a unique new animal model of epilepsy that mimics the complex genetic architecture of common disease.",

        "Abstract": "The gene defective in fidget mice encodes fidgetin, a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) family of ATPases. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified cAMP-dependent protein kinase A anchoring protein 95 kDa (AKAP95) as a potential fidgetin-binding protein. Epitope-tagged fidgetin co-localized with endogenous AKAP95 in the nuclear matrix, and the physical interaction between fidgetin and AKAP95 was further confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation. To evaluate the biological significance of the fidgetin-AKAP95 binding, we created AKAP95 mutant mice through a gene trap strategy. Akap95 mutant mice are surprisingly viable with no overt phenotype. However, a significant number of mice carrying both Akap95 and fidget mutations die soon after birth due to cleft palate, consistent with the overlapping expression of AKAP95 and fidgetin in the branchial arches during mouse embryogenesis. These results expand the spectrum of the pleiotropic phenotypes of fidget mice and provide new leads on the in vivo function of AKAP95.",

        "Abstract": "The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is an evoked potential response of auditory activity in the auditory nerve and subsequent fiber tracts and nuclei within the auditory brainstem pathways. The threshold, amplitude, and latency analysis of the ABR provides information on the peripheral hearing status and the integrity of brainstem pathways. In this study, we compared the threshold, amplitude, and latency of ABRs recorded from 149 mice of 10 commonly used inbred strains (BALB/cJ, C3HeB/FeJ, C3H/HeJ, CAST/EiJ, CBA/CaJ, CBA/J, FVB/NJ, MRL/MpJ, NZB/BlNJ, and SJL/J) using clicks of different intensities. The ABR thresholds of these strains ranged from 32 to 43 dB SPL. The amplitude of both waves I and IV of ABRs, which increased monotonically with click intensity in most strains, differed significantly among different strains at each intensity tested. Moreover, the amplitude of both waves was inversely correlated with the body weight of each strain at most intensities tested. In general, the amplitude of wave IV was smaller than that of wave I resulting in the IV/I amplitude ratio of <1.0 in all strains. The peak latency of both waves I and IV decreased significantly with click intensity in each strain. However, this intensity-dependent decrease was greater for wave IV than for wave I such that the wave I-IV inter-peak latency also decreased significantly with increasing intensity. I-IV inter-peak latencies for MRL/MpJ, C3HeB/FeJ, NZB/BlNJ, and C3H/HeJ strains are longer than FVB/NJ, SJL/J, or CAST/EiJ. This work is the first step to study the genetic basis underlying strain-related differences in auditory pathway.",

        "Abstract": "The M-type K+ current [IK(M)] activates in response to membrane depolarization and regulates neuronal excitability. Mutations in two subunits (KCNQ2 and KCNQ3; Kv7.2 and Kv7.3) that underlie the M-channel cause the human seizure disorder benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC), presumably by reducing IK(M) function. In mice, the Szt1 mutation, which deletes the genomic DNA encoding the KCNQ2 C terminus and all of CHRNA4 (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha4 subunit) and ARFGAP-1 (GTPase-activating protein that inactivates ADP-ribosylation factor 1), reduces seizure threshold, and alters M-channel pharmacosensitivity. Genomic deletions affecting the C terminus of KCNQ2 have been identified in human families with BFNC, and truncation of the C terminus prevents proper KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channel assembly in Xenopus oocytes. We showed previously that Szt1 mice have a reduced baseline seizure threshold and altered sensitivity to drugs that act at the M-channel. Specifically, the proconvulsant M-channel blocker linopirdine and anticonvulsant enhancer retigabine display increased and decreased potency, respectively, in Szt1 mice. To investigate the effects of the Szt1 mutation on IK(M) function explicitly, perforated-patch electrophysiology was performed in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus in brain slices prepared from C57BL/6J-Szt1/+ and control C57BL/6J+/+ mice. Our results show that Szt1 reduces both IK(M) amplitude and current density, inhibits spike frequency adaptation, and alters many aspects of M-channel pharmacology. This is the first evidence that a naturally occurring Kcnq2 mutation diminishes the amplitude and function of the native neuronal IK(M), resulting in significantly increased neuronal excitability. Finally, the changes in single-cell biophysical properties likely underlie the altered seizure threshold and pharmacosensitivity reported previously in Szt1 mice.",

        "Title": "Severe epilepsy resulting from genetic interaction between Scn2a and Kcnq2.",
        "Abstract": "A mutation in the voltage-gated sodium-channel Scn2a results in moderate epilepsy in transgenic Scn2a(Q54) mice maintained on a C57BL/6J strain background. The onset of progressive epilepsy begins in adults with short-duration partial seizures that originate in the hippocampus. The underlying abnormality is an increase in persistent sodium current in hippocampal neurons. The voltage-gated potassium channel Kcnq2 is responsible for generating M current (I(KM)) that is thought to control excitability and limit repetitive firing of hippocampal neurons. To determine whether impaired M current would exacerbate the seizure phenotype of Scn2a(Q54) mice, we carried out genetic crosses with two mutant alleles of Kcnq2. Szt1 mice carry a spontaneous deletion that removes the C-terminal domain of Kcnq2. A novel Kcnq2 missense mutation V182M was identified by screening the offspring of ENU-treated males for reduced threshold to electrically evoked minimal clonic seizures. Double mutant mice carrying the Scn2a(Q54) transgene together with either of the Kcnq2 mutations exhibited severe epilepsy with early onset, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and juvenile lethality by 3 weeks of age. This dramatic exacerbation of the sodium-channel mutant phenotype indicates that M current plays a critical role in preventing seizure initiation and spreading in this animal model. The genetic interaction between Scn2a and Kcnq2 demonstrates that combinations of mild alleles of monogenic epilepsy genes can result in severe disease and provides a model for complex inheritance of human epilepsy. The data suggest that interaction between these genes might contribute to the variable expressivity observed in human families with sodium-channel mutations. In a screen of 23 SMEI patients with missense mutations of SCN1A, no second-site mutations in KCNQ2 were identified.",

        "Abstract": "Muscular dystrophies include a diverse group of genetically heterogeneous disorders that together affect 1 in 2000 births worldwide. The diseases are characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting that lead to severe disability and often premature death. Rostrocaudal muscular dystrophy (rmd) is a new recessive mouse mutation that causes a rapidly progressive muscular dystrophy and a neonatal forelimb bone deformity. The rmd mutation is a 1.6-kb intragenic deletion within the choline kinase beta (Chkb) gene, resulting in a complete loss of CHKB protein and enzymatic activity. CHKB is one of two mammalian choline kinase (CHK) enzymes (alpha and beta) that catalyze the phosphorylation of choline to phosphocholine in the biosynthesis of the major membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine. While mutant rmd mice show a dramatic decrease of CHK activity in all tissues, the dystrophy is only evident in skeletal muscle tissues in an unusual rostral-to-caudal gradient. Minor membrane disruption similar to dysferlinopathies suggest that membrane fusion defects may underlie this dystrophy, because severe membrane disruptions are not evident as determined by creatine kinase levels, Evans Blue infiltration, and unaltered levels of proteins in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. The rmd mutant mouse offers the first demonstration of a defect in a phospholipid biosynthetic enzyme causing muscular dystrophy, representing a unique model for understanding mechanisms of muscle degeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Generation and turnover of phosphoinositides (PIs) must be coordinated in a spatial- and temporal-restricted manner. The small GTPase Rab5 interacts with two PI 3-kinases, Vps34 and PI3Kbeta, suggesting that it regulates the production of 3-PIs at various stages of the early endocytic pathway. Here, we discovered that Rab5 also interacts directly with PI 5- and PI 4-phosphatases and stimulates their activity. Rab5 regulates the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns[3]P) through a dual mechanism, by directly phosphorylating phosphatidylinositol via Vps34 and by a hierarchical enzymatic cascade of phosphoinositide-3-kinasebeta (PI3Kbeta), PI 5-, and PI 4-phosphatases. The functional importance of such an enzymatic pathway is demonstrated by the inhibition of transferrin uptake upon silencing of PI 4-phosphatase and studies in weeble mutant mice, where deficiency of PI 4-phosphatase causes an increase of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and a reduction in PtdIns(3)P. Activation of PI 3-kinase at the plasma membrane is accompanied by the recruitment of Rab5, PI 4-, and PI 5-phosphatases to the cell cortex. Our data provide the first evidence for a dual role of a Rab GTPase in regulating both generation and turnover of PIs via PI kinases and phosphatases to coordinate signaling functions with organelle homeostasis.",

To study these early stages, and to evaluate potential treatments in relevant animal models, requires a sensitive functional assay. To this end, we sought to determine whether the gait pattern of SOD1 transgenic mice changed prior to overt symptoms. Using a simplified video-based approach we compared the treadmill gait of C57BL/6J and B6.SOD1 transgenic mice at 8 and 10 weeks of age. B6.SOD1 mice had significantly longer stride and stance times than controls by 8 weeks. Consistent with disease progression, hindpaw measures of B6.SOD1 mice showed larger changes than front paws. Differences between control and B6.SOD1 mice increased at 10 weeks, but only because repeat testing caused habituation in control mice to a greater extent than in B6.SOD1 mice. Together the results demonstrate that simplified gait analysis is sensitive to early processes of motor system disease in mice.",

        "Abstract": "To characterize the genetic basis of spike-wave discharges (SWDs) detected by electroencephalography (EEG) in C3H/He mice, substrains of C3H mice were evaluated by EEG and sensitivity to ethosuximide. Crosses with the SWD-negative strain C57BL/6J were performed to map the underlying gene(s). C3H/He substrains exhibited a modest incidence (average of 19 SWDs per hour) of 7-8 Hz SWDs when at rest, compared with the C3HeB/Fe subline (four SWDs per hour). In the mapping backcross, however, many mice showed a very high incidence (50-220 SWDs per hour) throughout the recording period. SWDs were first detected at 3.5 weeks of age, were associated with behavioral arrest, were suppressed by ethosuximide, and were strongest in the cerebral cortex and thalamus. The major C3H determinant of SWDs, spkw1 (spike-wave 1), mapped to chromosome (Chr 9), and together with a C57BL/6J determinant on Chr 8, spkw2, accounted for more than one-half of the phenotypic variation in the backcross mice. The modest SWD incidence in C3H/He mice and the high incidence in backcrosses implies that SWD could be a confounding variable for other behaviors. Because C3H/He mice have no other brain abnormalities, they are an attractive alternative for studying idiopathic absence epilepsy.",

        "Title": "Functional characterization of fidgetin, an AAA-family protein mutated in fidget mice.",
        "Abstract": "The mouse fidget mutation is an autosomal recessive mutation that renders reduced or absent semicircular canals, microphthalmia, and various skeletal abnormalities to affected mice. We previously identified the defective gene which encodes fidgetin, a new member of the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA proteins). Here, we report on the subcellular localization of fidgetin as well as that of two closely related proteins, fidgetin-like 1 and fidgetin-like 2. Epitope-tagging and immunostaining revealed that both fidgetin and fidgetin-like 2 were predominantly localized to the nucleus, whereas fidgetin-like 1 was both nuclear and cytoplasmic. Furthermore, deletion studies identified a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal in the middle portion of the fidgetin protein. Since AAA proteins are known to form functional hetero- or homo-hexamers, we used reciprocal immunoprecipitation to examine the potential interaction among these proteins. We found that fidgetin interacted with itself and this specific interaction was abolished when either the N- or C-terminus of the protein was truncated. Taken together, our results suggest that fidgetin is a nuclear AAA-family protein with the potential to form homo-oligomers, thus representing the first step towards the elucidation of fidgetin's cellular function and the disease mechanism in fidget mutant mice.",

        "Abstract": "The voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma4 subunit protein, CACNG4, is closely related to the gamma2 subunit, CACNG2. Both are expressed primarily in the brain and share 53% amino acid identity. The Cacng2 gene is disrupted in the stargazer mouse, with its distinctive phenotype including ataxia, frequent absence seizure episodes, and head elevation. A disruption within Cacng4 was engineered to assess its particular function. The homozygous Cacng4-targeted mutant mouse appeared normal with no ataxic gait or absence seizures, suggesting that other members of the gamma subunit family might functionally compensate for the absence of CACNG4. To test this hypothesis, the targeted Cacng4 mutation was combined with alleles of Cacng2. Absence seizures were observed in combination with the stargazer 3J mutation, which itself does not have seizures, and increased seizure activity was observed in combination with the waggler allele. Furthermore, within the corticothalamic loop, where absence seizures arise, CACNG4 expression is restricted to the thalamus. Our studies show that the CACNG4 protein has seizure suppressing activity, but this effect is revealed only when CACNG2 expression is also compromised, suggesting that CACNG subunits have in vivo overlapping functions.",

The efforts of three NIH Mutagenesis Centers established for the detection of neuroscience-related phenotypes are described. Each center has developed an extensive panel of phenotype screens that assess nervous system structure and function. In particular, these screens focus on complex behavioral traits from drug and alcohol responses to circadian rhythms to epilepsy. Each of these centers has developed a bioinformatics infrastructure to track the extensive number of transactions that are inherent in these large-scale projects. Over 100 new mouse mutant lines have been defined through the efforts of these three mutagenesis centers and are presented to the research community via the centralized Web presence of the Neuromice.org consortium (http://www.neuromice.org). This community resource provides visitors with the ability to search for specific mutant phenotypes, to view the genetic and phenotypic details of mutant mouse lines, and to order these mice for use in their own research program.",

To address these questions, we sequenced approximately 9.6 Mb of DNA from G1 progeny of ethylnitrosourea-treated mice in a large, broad-spectrum screen. We identified 10 mutations at eight unique sites, including six nonsynonymous coding substitutions. This calibrates the nucleotide mutation rate for two mutagenesis centers, implies significance criteria for positional cloning efforts, and provides working estimates of effective genetic target sizes for selected phenotypes.",

        "Abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common but genetically complex neurological disorders in humans. Identifying animal models that recapitulate human epilepsies is important for pharmacological studies of anticonvulsants, dissection of molecular and biochemical pathogenesis of epilepsy, and discovery of epilepsy susceptibility genes. We discovered that the PL/J inbred mouse strain is susceptible to handling- and rhythmic tossing-induced seizure. The tonic-clonic and generalized seizures observed after induction were accompanied by abnormal EEGs, similar to seizures observed in EL and SWXL-4 mice. PL/J mice also had an extremely low threshold to electroconvulsive seizures compared to other strains and showed variable sensitivity to pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. Gross neurostructural abnormalities were not found in PL/J mice. Crosses with the seizure-resistant C57BL/6 J strain revealed semidominant inheritance of the rhythmic tossing seizure trait with low penetrance. F2 progeny indicated that the genetic inheritance of seizure susceptibility in PL/J is non-Mendelian. We crossed DBA/2 J mice, which are resistant to rhythmic tossing seizure but susceptible to audiogenic seizures, to PL/J. We found that seizure penetrance in (DBA/2 J x PL/J)F1 mice was similar to the penetrance in (C57BL/6 J x PL/J)F1 mice but the severity and frequency of seizure were higher in (DBA/2 J x PL/J)F1 mice. The PL/J strain serves as an interesting new model for studying the genetics, neurobiology, and pharmacology of epilepsy.",

        "Abstract": "Pou4f3 (Brn3.1, Brn3c) is a class IV POU domain transcription factor that has a central function in the development of all hair cells in the human and mouse inner ear sensory epithelia. A mutation of POU4F3 underlies human autosomal dominant non-syndromic progressive hearing loss DFNA15. Through a comparison of inner ear gene expression profiles of E16.5 wild-type and Pou4f3 mutant deaf mice using a high density oligonucleotide microarray, we identified the gene encoding growth factor independence 1 (Gfi1) as a likely in vivo target gene regulated by Pou4f3. To validate this result, we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridizations for Gfi1 on wild-type and Pou4f3 mutant mice. Our results demonstrate that a deficiency of Pou4f3 leads to a statistically significant reduction in Gfi1 expression levels and that the dynamics of Gfi1 mRNA abundance closely follow the pattern of expression for Pou4f3. To examine the role of Gfi1 in the pathogenesis of Pou4f3-related deafness, we performed comparative analyses of the embryonic inner ears of Pou4f3 and Gfi1 mouse mutants using immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. The loss of Gfi1 results in outer hair cell degeneration, which appears comparable to that observed in Pou4f3 mutants. These results identify Gfi1 as the first downstream target of a hair cell specific transcription factor and suggest that outer hair cell degeneration in Pou4f3 mutants is largely or entirely a result of the loss of expression of Gfi1.",

        "Title": "Genetic approaches to studying mouse models of human seizure disorders.",
        "Abstract": "In conclusion, we have discussed a reverse genetics approach to studying seizure disorders in mice (Fig. 1), employing a targeted mutagenesis method to exploit the genetic defects identified in human epilepsy families. After detailed characterization of the nature of the human mutation and the mouse counterpart gene, a targeting vector containing the human disease allele is created. The endogenous mouse gene is replaced by the human disease allele through homologous recombination in ES cells, leading to the generation of chimeric animals. Mice carrying one copy or both copies of the human mutation can be bred to study the phenotypic effect of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. At this stage, one may want to split the newly created mice into two groups. One group will go through seizure phenotyping tests, while the other group will be used to generate disease allele-carrying mice on a different genetic background. Phenotypic characterization of mice on different inbred strains includes behavioral monitoring and EEG analysis looking for the occurrence of spontaneous seizures, as well as routine cage examination looking for handling-provoked seizure and ECT- and PTZ- induced seizure paradigms looking for sensitivity to these stimuli. A complete evaluation of the seizure phenotype at the whole-animal level establishes the relevance of the mouse model to the human condition. Further investigation including imaging, electrophysiology and AED response in these mouse models will shed light on the mechanistic basis of the convulsive disorder. Current epilepsy research in mouse genetics offers promise for understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie epileptogenesis in humans. A large-scale forward genetic effort to create novel mouse mutants with seizure phenotypes by in vivo chemical mutagenesis with ethyl-nitroso urea (ENU) is underway at the Jackson Laboratory (http://www.jax.org/nmf/). Genetic mapping and isolation of the affected genes in these seizure-prone models will provide additional molecular pathways involved in seizures. The mutant mice generated through both forward and reverse genetic approaches will be a valuable resource for the biomedical community to study epilepsy at the molecular level and to characterize the pathological consequences of seizures in the whole organism.",

        "Title": "Three ENU-induced neurological mutations in the pore loop of sodium channel Scn8a (Na(v)1.6) and a genetically linked retinal mutation, rd13.",
        "Abstract": "The goal of The Jackson Laboratory Neuroscience Mutagenesis Facility is to generate mouse models of human neurological disease. We describe three new models obtained from a three-generation screen for recessive mutations. Homozygous mutant mice from lines nmf2 and nmf5 exhibit hind limb paralysis and juvenile lethality. Homozygous nmf58 mice exhibit a less severe movement disorder that includes sustained dystonic postures. The mutations were mapped to the distal region of mouse Chromosome (Chr) 15. Failure to complement a mutant allele of a positional candidate gene, Scn8a, demonstrated that the mutations are new alleles of Scn8a. Missense mutations of evolutionarily conserved residues of the sodium channel were identified in the three lines, with the predicted amino acid substitutions N1370T, I1392F, and L1404H. These residues are located within the pore loop of domain 3 of sodium channel Na(v)1.6. The lethal phenotypes suggest that the new alleles encode proteins with partial or complete loss of function. Several human disorders are caused by mutation in the pore loop of domain 3 of paralogous sodium channel genes. Line nmf5 contains a second, independent mutation in the rd13 locus that causes a reduction in cell number in the outer nuclear layer of the retina. rd13 was mapped to the distal 4 Mb of Chr 15. No coding or splice site mutations were detected in Pde1b, a candidate gene for rd13. The generation of three independent Scn8a mutations among 1100 tested G3 families demonstrates that the Scn8a locus is highly susceptible to ENU mutagenesis. The new alleles of Scn8a will be valuable for analysis of sodium channel physiology and disease.",

        "Abstract": "The study of genetic variation in mice offers a powerful experimental platform for understanding gene function. Complex trait analysis, gene-targeting and gene-trapping technologies, as well as insertional and chemical mutagenesis approaches are becoming increasingly sophisticated and provide a variety of options for cataloguing gene activities and interactions. In this review we discuss fundamental and practical concepts related to chemical mutagenesis and we highlight the growing list of strategies for performing mutagenesis screens in mice. Gene-driven and diverse types of phenotype-driven screens provide several options for the recovery of the invaluable variety of alleles generated by chemical mutagenesis. The unique advantages offered using chemical mutagenesis compare favourably to and complement the spectrum of approaches available for functional annotation of the mammalian genome.",

        "Title": "Phenotypic heterogeneity in the stargazin allelic series.",
        "Abstract": "The stargazer mutant mouse is characterized by its ataxic gait, head tossing, and absence seizures. The mutation was identified in the gamma 2 subunit gene of the high voltage-dependent calcium channel, Cacng2. Subsequently, two allelic variants of stargazer have arisen, waggler and stargazer 3J. In this study, we have compared these new alleles to the original stargazer allele. All three mutations affect the Cacng2 mRNA levels as they all arise from disruptions within the introns of this gene. Our results show that the mutations cause reduced Cacng2 mRNA and protein levels. Stargazer and waggler mice have the least amount of mRNA and undetectable protein, whereas stargazer 3J appears to be the mildest allele, both in terms of the phenotype and protein expression. Electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis confirmed that stargazer has frequent spike-wave discharges (SWDs); the average duration of each discharge burst is 5 seconds and recurs every minute. The waggler allele causes a greater variation in SWD activity depending on the individual mouse, and the stargazer 3J mouse has no SWDs. The preliminary characterization of this heterogeneous allelic series provides a basis to explore more biochemical and physiological parameters relating to the role of the Cacng2 product in calcium channel activity, AMPA receptor localization, and cerebellar disturbances.",

        "Abstract": "The electroconvulsive threshold (ECT) test has been used extensively to determine the protection conferred by antiepileptic drug candidates against induced seizures in rodents. Despite its clinical relevance, the potential of ECT to identify mouse epilepsy models in genetic studies has not been thoroughly assessed. We adopted the ECT test to screen the progeny of ethylnitrosourea treated male C57BL/6J mice. In a small-scale screen, several mutant lines conferring a low threshold to ECT minimal clonic seizures were mapped to the telomeric region of mouse chromosome 2 in independent founder families. This high incidence was suggestive of a single spontaneous event that pre-existed in the founders of mutagenized stock. Genetic and physical mapping led to the discovery that several lines shared a single mutation, Szt1 (seizure threshold-1), consisting of a 300 kb deletion of genomic DNA involving three known genes. Two of these genes, Kcnq2 and Chrna4, are known to be mutated in human epilepsy families. Szt1 homozygotes and heterozygotes display similar phenotypes to those found in the respective Kcnq2 knockout mutant mice, suggesting that Kcnq2 haploinsufficiency is at the root of the Szt1 seizure sensitivity. Our results provide a novel genetic model for epilepsy research and demonstrate that the approach of using ECT to study seizures in mice has the potential to lead to the identification of human epilepsy susceptibility genes.",

Here, we report the results of an international collaboration to produce a high-quality draft sequence of the mouse genome. We also present an initial comparative analysis of the mouse and human genomes, describing some of the insights that can be gleaned from the two sequences. We discuss topics including the analysis of the evolutionary forces shaping the size, structure and sequence of the genomes; the conservation of large-scale synteny across most of the genomes; the much lower extent of sequence orthology covering less than half of the genomes; the proportions of the genomes under selection; the number of protein-coding genes; the expansion of gene families related to reproduction and immunity; the evolution of proteins; and the identification of intraspecies polymorphism.",

        "Abstract": "Harlequin (Hq) mutant mice have progressive degeneration of terminally differentiated cerebellar and retinal neurons. We have identified the Hq mutation as a proviral insertion in the apoptosis-inducing factor (Aif) gene, causing about an 80% reduction in AIF expression. Mutant cerebellar granule cells are susceptible to exogenous and endogenous peroxide-mediated apoptosis, but can be rescued by AIF expression. Overexpression of AIF in wild-type granule cells further decreases peroxide-mediated cell death, suggesting that AIF serves as a free radical scavenger. In agreement, dying neurons in aged Hq mutant mice show oxidative stress. In addition, neurons damaged by oxidative stress in both the cerebellum and retina of Hq mutant mice re-enter the cell cycle before undergoing apoptosis. Our results provide a genetic model of oxidative stress-mediated neurodegeneration and demonstrate a direct connection between cell cycle re-entry and oxidative stress in the ageing central nervous system.",

        "Abstract": "Muscular dystrophy with myositis (mdm) is a recessive mouse mutation that causes severe and progressive muscular degeneration. Here we report the identification of the mdm mutation as a complex rearrangement that includes a deletion and a LINE insertion in the titin (Ttn) gene. Mutant allele-specific splicing results in the deletion of 83 amino acids from the N2A region of TTN, a domain thought to bind calpain-3 (CAPN3) the product of the human limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A) gene. The Ttn(mdm) mutant mouse may serve as a model for human tibial muscular dystrophy, which maps to the TTN locus at 2q31 and shows a secondary reduction of CAPN3 similar to that observed in mdm skeletal muscle. This is the first demonstration that a mutation in Ttn is associated with muscular dystrophy and provides a novel animal model to test for functional interactions between TTN and CAPN3.",
