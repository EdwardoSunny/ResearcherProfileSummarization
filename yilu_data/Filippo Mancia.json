The brain has a particularly high demand for choline, but how it enters the brain has eluded the field for over fifty years. The MFS transporter FLVCR1 was recently determined to be a choline transporter, and while this protein is not highly expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), its relative FLVCR2 is.

        "Abstract": "Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential structural component of the bacterial cell wall that is synthetized during cell division and elongation. PG forms an extracellular polymer crucial for cellular viability, the synthesis of which is the target of many antibiotics. PG assembly requires a glycosyltransferase (GT) to generate a glycan polymer using a Lipid II substrate, which is then crosslinked to the existing PG via a transpeptidase (TP) reaction. A Shape, Elongation, Division and Sporulation (SEDS) GT enzyme and a Class B Penicillin Binding Protein (PBP) form the core of the multi-protein complex required for PG assembly. Here we used single particle cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of a cell elongation-specific E. coli RodA-PBP2 complex. We combine this information with biochemical, genetic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses to identify the Lipid II binding sites and propose a mechanism for Lipid II polymerization. Our data suggest a hypothesis for the movement of the glycan strand from the Lipid II polymerization site of RodA towards the TP site of PBP2, functionally linking these two central enzymatic activities required for cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis.",

The emergence of several variants of concern (VOC) can reduce binding affinity to diagnostic antibodies, limiting the efficacy of the currently adopted tests, while showing unaltered or increased affinity for the host receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We present a graphene field-effect transistor (gFET) biosensor design, which exploits the Spike-ACE2 interaction, the crucial step for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Extensive computational analyses show that a chimeric ACE2-Fragment crystallizable (ACE2-Fc) construct mimics the native receptor dimeric conformation. ACE2-Fc functionalized gFET allows ",

        "Title": "Gone with the Wnt(less): a mechanistic perspective on the journey of Wnt.",
        "Abstract": "Wnts are short-range signaling proteins, expressed in all metazoans from sponges to humans, critical for cell development and fate. There are 19 different Wnts in the human genome with varying expression levels and patterns, and post-translational modifications. Common to essentially all Wnts is the palmitoleation of a conserved serine by the O-acyltransferase PORCN in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). All lipidated Wnts then bind a dedicated carrier Wntless (WLS), endowed with the task of transporting them from the ER to the plasma membrane, and ultimately facilitating their release to receptors on the Wnt-receiving cell to initiate signaling. Here, we will focus on the WLS-mediated transport step. There are currently two published structures, both obtained by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy of the Wnt/WLS complex: human Wnt8A-bound and human Wnt3A-bound WLS. We analyze the two Wnt/WLS structures - remarkably similar despite the sequence similarity between Wnt8A and Wnt3A being only \u223c39% - to begin to understand the conserved nature of this binding mechanism, and ultimately how one carrier can accommodate a family of 19 different Wnts. By comparing how Wnt associates with WLS with how it binds to PORCN and FZD receptors, we can begin to speculate on mechanisms of Wnt transfer from PORCN to WLS, and from WLS to FZD, thus providing molecular-level insight into these essential steps of the Wnt signaling pathway.",

An important contributor to their evolutionary success is their unique cell envelope, which constitutes a quasi-impermeable barrier, protecting the microorganism from external threats, antibiotics included. The arabinofuranosyltransferases are a family of enzymes, unique to the Actinobacteria family that mycobacteria genus belongs to, that are critical to building of this cell envelope. In this chapter, we will analyze available structures of members of the mycobacterial arabinofuranosyltransferase, clarify their function, as well as explore the common themes present amongst this family of enzymes, as revealed by recent research.",

The mycobacterial cell wall is vital for cell growth, virulence, and resistance to antibiotics, and thus constitutes a unique target for drug development. To characterize the enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of the cell wall components, considerable amounts of substrates are required. Since many mycobacterial cell wall lipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), are not commercially available, isolation from cell biomass is the most straightforward way to obtain these compounds. In this study, we optimized a protocol to extract and purify PIM species, in particular Ac",

        "Title": "Evidence for the early emergence of piperaquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria and modeling strategies to mitigate resistance.",
        "Abstract": "Multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites have emerged in Cambodia and neighboring countries in Southeast Asia, compromising the efficacy of first-line antimalarial combinations. Dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine (PPQ) treatment failure rates have risen to as high as 50% in some areas in this region. For PPQ, resistance is driven primarily by a series of mutant alleles of the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT). PPQ resistance was reported in China three decades earlier, but the molecular driver remained unknown. Herein, we identify a PPQ-resistant pfcrt allele (China C) from Yunnan Province, China, whose genotypic lineage is distinct from the PPQ-resistant pfcrt alleles currently observed in Cambodia. Combining gene editing and competitive growth assays, we report that PfCRT China C confers moderate PPQ resistance while re-sensitizing parasites to chloroquine (CQ) and incurring a fitness cost that manifests as a reduced rate of parasite growth. PPQ transport assays using purified PfCRT isoforms, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, highlight differences in drug transport kinetics and in this transporter's central cavity conformation between China C and the current Southeast Asian PPQ-resistant isoforms. We also report a novel computational model that incorporates empirically determined fitness landscapes at varying drug concentrations, combined with antimalarial susceptibility profiles, mutation rates, and drug pharmacokinetics. Our simulations with PPQ-resistant or -sensitive parasite lines predict that a three-day regimen of PPQ combined with CQ can effectively clear infections and prevent the evolution of PfCRT variants. This work suggests that including CQ in combination therapies could be effective in suppressing the evolution of PfCRT-mediated multidrug resistance in regions where PPQ has lost efficacy.",

Following a broad screen of sequence space to identify initial expression-positive targets, we employ a second step to select orthologs with closely related sequences to these hits. We demonstrate that a greater percentage of these latter targets express well and are stable in detergent, increasing the likelihood of identifying candidates that will ultimately yield structural information.",

        "Abstract": "Infectious diseases present a major threat to public health globally. Pathogens can acquire resistance to anti-infectious agents via several means including transporter-mediated efflux. Typically, multidrug transporters feature spacious, dynamic, and chemically malleable binding sites to aid in the recognition and transport of chemically diverse substrates across cell membranes. Here, we discuss recent structural investigations of multidrug transporters involved in resistance to infectious diseases that belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), the drug/metabolite transporter (DMT) superfamily, the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family, the small multidrug resistance (SMR) family, and the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) superfamily. These structural insights provide invaluable information for understanding and combatting multidrug resistance.",

        "Abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 epidemics quickly propagated worldwide, sorting virus genomic variants in newly established propagules of infections. Stochasticity in transmission within and between countries or an actual selective advantage could explain the global high frequency reached by some genomic variants. Using statistical analyses, demographic reconstructions, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the globally invasive G614 spike variant 1) underwent a significant demographic expansion in most countries explained neither by stochastic effects nor by overrepresentation in clinical samples, 2) increases the spike S1/S2 furin-like site conformational plasticity (short-range effect), and 3) modifies the internal motion of the receptor-binding domain affecting its cross-connection with other functional domains (long-range effect). Our results support the hypothesis of a selective advantage at the basis of the spread of the G614 variant, which we suggest may be due to structural modification of the spike protein at the S1/S2 proteolytic site, and provide structural information to guide the design of variant-specific drugs.",

        "Abstract": "Wnts are evolutionarily conserved ligands that signal at short range to regulate morphogenesis, cell fate, and stem cell renewal. The first and essential steps in Wnt secretion are their O-palmitoleation and subsequent loading onto the dedicated transporter Wntless/evenness interrupted (WLS/Evi). We report the 3.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of palmitoleated human WNT8A in complex with WLS. This is accompanied by biochemical experiments to probe the physiological implications of the observed association. The WLS membrane domain has close structural homology to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). A Wnt hairpin inserts into a conserved hydrophobic cavity in the GPCR-like domain, and the palmitoleate protrudes between two helices into the bilayer. A conformational switch of highly conserved residues on a separate Wnt hairpin might contribute to its transfer to receiving cells. This work provides molecular-level insights into a central mechanism in animal body plan development and stem cell biology.",

        "Abstract": "Structure determination of membrane proteins is critical to the molecular understanding of many life processes, yet it has historically been a technically challenging endeavor. This past decade has given rise to a number of technological advancements, techniques, and reagents, which have facilitated membrane protein structural biology, resulting in an ever-growing number of membrane protein structures determined. To collate these advances, we have mined available literature to analyze the purification and structure determination specifics for all uniquely solved membrane protein structures from 2010 to 2019. Our analyses demonstrate the strong impact of single-particle cryo-electron microscopy on the field and illustrate how this technique has affected detergent and membrane mimetic usage. Furthermore, we detail how different structure determination methods, taxonomic domains and protein classes have unique detergent/membrane mimetic profiles, highlighting the importance of tailoring their selection. Our analyses provide a quantitative overview of where the field of membrane protein structural biology stands and how it has developed over time. We anticipate that these will serve as a useful tool to streamline future membrane protein structure determination by guiding the choice of detergent/membrane mimetic.",

        "Abstract": "Polymyxin resistance (PR) threatens the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infections. PR frequently arises through chemical modification of the lipid A portion of lipopolysaccharide. Various mutations are implicated in PR, including in three two-component systems-CrrA/B, PmrA/B, and PhoP/Q-and the negative regulator MgrB. Few have been functionally validated. Therefore, here we adapt a CRISPR-Cas9 system to CRKP to elucidate how mutations in clinical CRKP isolates induce PR. We demonstrate that CrrB is a positive regulator of PR, and common clinical mutations lead to the addition of both 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (L-Ara4N) and phosophethanolamine (pEtN) to lipid A, inducing notably higher polymyxin minimum inhibitory concentrations than mgrB disruption. Additionally, crrB mutations cause a significant virulence increase at a fitness cost, partially from activation of the pentose phosphate pathway. Our data demonstrate the importance of CrrB in high-level PR and establish important differences across crrB alleles in balancing resistance with fitness and virulence.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in single-particle cryogenic-electron microscopy have facilitated an exponential growth in the number of membrane protein structures determined to close to atomic resolution. Nevertheless, despite improvements in microscope hardware, cryo-EM software and sample preparation techniques, challenges remain for structural analysis of small-sized membrane proteins (i.e.<150 kilodalton). Here we discuss recent examples of structures of macromolecules from this category determined by cryo-EM. We analyze the underlying difficulties, the enabling technologies such as the use of antibody fragments to gain size and provide fiducials for particle alignment, and the unresolved issues like dislocation of complexes at the air-water interface. Finally, we briefly highlight the biological relevance of some of these success stories, and our predictions for the future.",

        "Abstract": "In mycobacteria, phosphatidylinositol (PI) acts as a common lipid anchor for key components of the cell wall, including the glycolipids phosphatidylinositol mannoside, lipomannan, and lipoarabinomannan. Glycolipids in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, are important virulence factors that modulate the host immune response. The identity-defining step in PI biosynthesis in prokaryotes, unique to mycobacteria and few other bacterial species, is the reaction between cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol and inositol-phosphate to yield phosphatidylinositol-phosphate, the immediate precursor to PI. This reaction is catalyzed by the cytidine diphosphate-alcohol phosphotransferase phosphatidylinositol-phosphate synthase (PIPS), an essential enzyme for mycobacterial viability. Here we present structures of PIPS from Mycobacterium kansasii with and without evidence of donor and acceptor substrate binding obtained using a crystal engineering approach. PIPS from Mycobacterium kansasii is 86% identical to the ortholog from M. tuberculosis and catalytically active. Functional experiments guided by our structural results allowed us to further characterize the molecular determinants of substrate specificity and catalysis in a new mycobacterial species. This work provides a framework to strengthen our understanding of phosphatidylinositol-phosphate biosynthesis in the context of mycobacterial pathogens.",

        "Abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes tuberculosis, a disease that kills over 1 million people each year. Its cell envelope is a common antibiotic target and has a unique structure due, in part, to two lipidated polysaccharides-arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan. Arabinofuranosyltransferase D (AftD) is an essential enzyme involved in assembling these glycolipids. We present the 2.9-\u00c5 resolution structure of M.\u00a0abscessus AftD, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. AftD has a conserved GT-C glycosyltransferase fold and three carbohydrate-binding modules. Glycan array analysis shows that AftD binds complex arabinose glycans. Additionally, AftD is non-covalently complexed with an acyl carrier protein (ACP). 3.4- and 3.5-\u00c5 structures of a mutant with impaired ACP binding reveal a conformational change, suggesting that ACP may regulate AftD function. Mutagenesis experiments using a conditional knockout constructed in M.\u00a0smegmatis confirm the essentiality of the putative active site and the ACP binding for AftD function.",

        "Abstract": "STRA6 (stimulated by retinoic acid 6) is a 75kDa polytopic transmembrane protein that facilitates cellular retinol uptake from retinol-binding protein (RBP). Structural characterization of STRA6 from Danio rerio purified in detergent and reconstituted in amphipol A8-35 was achieved by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This provided the first high-resolution snapshot of this protein, showing a novel topology of a tightly assembled homodimer, and an unexpected physiological association with calmodulin in addition to insights into its potential mechanism of function. Specifically, a large hydrophobic cavity in the center of STRA6 linked to the known site of interaction with RBP suggested a route of retinol entry into the cell by diffusion into the membrane through a lateral opening of the cavity directly into the bilayer. Moreover, the capability to produce pure and homogeneous protein has allowed previously unattainable functional characterization of STRA6 in a reconstituted system. Here, we describe detailed methods for Danio rerio STRA6 expression in insect cells, purification in detergent and reconstitution in amphipol for structural characterization by cryo-EM. Furthermore, we show reconstitution of the protein in liposomes for an in vitro proteoliposome-based assay of STRA6-mediated retinol uptake. Finally, we present methods and preliminary cryo-EM data for STRA6 incorporated in lipid-filled nanodiscs, a close to native milieu to study membrane protein structure and function.",

        "Title": "Regulatory mechanism for the transmembrane receptor that mediates bidirectional vitamin A transport.",
        "Abstract": "Vitamin A has diverse biological functions and is essential for human survival at every point from embryogenesis to adulthood. Vitamin A and its derivatives have been used to treat human diseases including vision diseases, skin diseases, and cancer. Both insufficient and excessive vitamin A uptake are detrimental, but how its transport is regulated is poorly understood. STRA6 is a multitransmembrane domain cell-surface receptor and mediates vitamin A uptake from plasma retinol binding protein (RBP). STRA6 can mediate both cellular vitamin A influx and efflux, but what regulates these opposing activities is unknown. To answer this question, we purified and identified STRA6-associated proteins in a native mammalian cell type that takes up vitamin A through STRA6 using mass spectrometry. We found that the major protein repeatedly identified as STRA6-associated protein is calmodulin, consistent with the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) study of zebrafish STRA6 associated with calmodulin. Using radioactivity-based, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based and real-time fluorescence techniques, we found that calmodulin profoundly affects STRA6's vitamin A transport activity. Increased calcium/calmodulin promotes cellular vitamin A efflux and suppresses vitamin A influx through STRA6. Further mechanistic studies revealed that calmodulin enhances the binding of apo-RBP to STRA6, and this enhancement is much more pronounced for apo-RBP than holo-RBP. This study revealed that calmodulin regulates STRA6's vitamin A influx or efflux activity by modulating its preferential interaction with apo-RBP or holo-RBP. This molecular mechanism of regulating vitamin A transport may point to new directions to treat human diseases associated with insufficient or excessive vitamin A uptake.",

        "Abstract": "Integral membrane transporters of the Mycobacterial Membrane Protein Large (MmpL) family and their interactome play important roles in the synthesis and export of mycobacterial outer membrane lipids. Despite the current interest in the mycolic acid transporter, MmpL3, from the perspective of drug discovery, the nature and biological significance of its interactome remain largely unknown. We here report on a genome-wide screening by two-hybrid system for MmpL3 binding partners. While a surprisingly low number of proteins involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis was found to interact with MmpL3, numerous enzymes and transporters participating in the biogenesis of peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan and lipoglycans, and the cell division regulatory protein, CrgA, were identified among the hits. Surface plasmon resonance and co-immunoprecipitation independently confirmed physical interactions for three proteins in vitro and/or in vivo. Results are in line with the focal localization of MmpL3 at the poles and septum of actively-growing bacilli where the synthesis of all major constituents of the cell wall core are known to occur, and are further suggestive of a role for MmpL3 in the coordination of new cell wall deposition during cell septation and elongation. This novel aspect of the physiology of MmpL3 may contribute to the extreme vulnerability and high therapeutic potential of this transporter.",

        "Abstract": "Vitamin A is a necessary nutrient for all mammals, and it is required for the transcription of many genes and vital for vision. While fasting, the vitamin A alcohol form (Retinol) from storage in the liver is mobilized and transported through the bloodstream while bound to retinol binding protein (RBP). Details of how exactly vitamin A is released from RBP and taken into the cells are still unclear. As part of the effort to elucidate the specifics of this process, single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structural studies of STRA6 (the RBP receptor 75-kDa transmembrane receptor protein) were recently reported by Chen et al. (Science, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad8266 , 2016). Interestingly, STRA6 from zebrafish was shown to be a stable dimer and bound to calmodulin (CaM), forming a 180-kDa complex. The topology of the STRA6 complex includes 18 transmembrane helices (nine per protomer) and two long horizontal intramembrane helices interacting at the dimer core (Chen et al., in Science, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad8266 , 2016). CaM was shown to interact with three regions of STRA6, termed CaMBP1, CaMBP2, and CaMBP3, with the most extensive interactions involving CaMBP2. To further our understanding of Ca",

        "Abstract": "Human transferrin receptor 1 (CD71) guarantees iron supply by endocytosis upon binding of iron-loaded transferrin and ferritin. Arenaviruses and the malaria parasite exploit CD71 for cell invasion and epitopes on CD71 for interaction with transferrin and pathogenic hosts were identified. Here, we provide the molecular basis of the CD71 ectodomain-human ferritin interaction by determining the 3.9\u2009\u00c5 resolution single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure of their complex and by validating our structural findings in a cellular context. The contact surfaces between the heavy-chain ferritin and CD71 largely overlap with arenaviruses and Plasmodium vivax binding regions in the apical part of the receptor ectodomain. Our data account for transferrin-independent binding of ferritin to CD71 and suggest that select pathogens may have adapted to enter cells by mimicking the ferritin access gate.",

        "Title": "Structural basis for catalysis at the membrane-water interface.",
        "Abstract": "The membrane-water interface forms a uniquely heterogeneous and geometrically constrained environment for enzymatic catalysis. Integral membrane enzymes sample three environments - the uniformly hydrophobic interior of the membrane, the aqueous extramembrane region, and the fuzzy, amphipathic interfacial region formed by the tightly packed headgroups of the components of the lipid bilayer. Depending on the nature of the substrates and the location of the site of chemical modification, catalysis may occur in each of these environments. The availability of structural information for alpha-helical enzyme families from each of these classes, as well as several beta-barrel enzymes from the bacterial outer membrane, has allowed us to review here the different ways in which each enzyme fold has adapted to the nature of the substrates, products, and the unique environment of the membrane. Our focus here is on enzymes that process lipidic substrates. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Bacterial Lipids edited by Russell E. Bishop.",

        "Abstract": "Vitamin A homeostasis is critical to normal cellular function. Retinol-binding protein (RBP) is the sole specific carrier in the bloodstream for hydrophobic retinol, the main form in which vitamin A is transported. The integral membrane receptor STRA6 mediates cellular uptake of vitamin A by recognizing RBP-retinol to trigger release and internalization of retinol. We present the structure of zebrafish STRA6 determined to 3.9-angstrom resolution by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. STRA6 has one intramembrane and nine transmembrane helices in an intricate dimeric assembly. Unexpectedly, calmodulin is bound tightly to STRA6 in a noncanonical arrangement. Residues involved with RBP binding map to an archlike structure that covers a deep lipophilic cleft. This cleft is open to the membrane, suggesting a possible mode for internalization of retinol through direct diffusion into the lipid bilayer.",

        "Abstract": "Polymyxins are antibiotics used in the last line of defense to combat multidrug-resistant infections by Gram-negative bacteria. Polymyxin resistance arises through charge modification of the bacterial outer membrane with the attachment of the cationic sugar 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose to lipid A, a reaction catalyzed by the integral membrane lipid-to-lipid glycosyltransferase 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose transferase (ArnT). Here, we report crystal structures of ArnT from Cupriavidus metallidurans, alone and in complex with the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate, at 2.8 and 3.2 angstrom resolution, respectively. The structures show cavities for both lipidic substrates, which converge at the active site. A structural rearrangement occurs on undecaprenyl phosphate binding, which stabilizes the active site and likely allows lipid A binding. Functional mutagenesis experiments based on these structures suggest a mechanistic model for ArnT family enzymes.",

        "Abstract": "The attachment of a sugar to a hydrophobic polyisoprenyl carrier is the first step for all extracellular glycosylation processes. The enzymes that perform these reactions, polyisoprenyl-glycosyltransferases (PI-GTs) include dolichol phosphate mannose synthase (DPMS), which generates the mannose donor for glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we report the 3.0 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of GtrB, a glucose-specific PI-GT from Synechocystis, showing a tetramer in which each protomer contributes two helices to a membrane-spanning bundle. The active site is 15 \u00c5 from the membrane, raising the question of how water-soluble and membrane-embedded substrates are brought into apposition for catalysis. A conserved juxtamembrane domain harbours disease mutations, which compromised activity in GtrB in vitro and in human DPM1 tested in zebrafish. We hypothesize a role of this domain in shielding the polyisoprenyl-phosphate for transport to the active site. Our results reveal the basis of PI-GT function, and provide a potential molecular explanation for DPM1-related disease.",

        "Abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol is critical for intracellular signalling and anchoring of carbohydrates and proteins to outer cellular membranes. The defining step in phosphatidylinositol biosynthesis is catalysed by CDP-alcohol phosphotransferases, transmembrane enzymes that use CDP-diacylglycerol as donor substrate for this reaction, and either inositol in eukaryotes or inositol phosphate in prokaryotes as the acceptor alcohol. Here we report the structures of a related enzyme, the phosphatidylinositol-phosphate synthase from Renibacterium salmoninarum, with and without bound CDP-diacylglycerol to 3.6 and 2.5 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. These structures reveal the location of the acceptor site, and the molecular determinants of substrate specificity and catalysis. Functional characterization of the 40%-identical ortholog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a potential target for the development of novel anti-tuberculosis drugs, supports the proposed mechanism of substrate binding and catalysis. This work therefore provides a structural and functional framework to understand the mechanism of phosphatidylinositol-phosphate biosynthesis.",

        "Title": "Native serotonin 5-HT2C receptors are expressed as homodimers on the apical surface of choroid plexus epithelial cells.",
        "Abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a prominent class of plasma membrane proteins that regulate physiologic responses to a wide variety of stimuli and therapeutic agents. Although GPCR oligomerization has been studied extensively in recombinant cells, it remains uncertain whether native receptors expressed in their natural cellular environment are monomers, dimers, or oligomers. The goal of this study was to determine the monomer/oligomer status of a native GPCR endogenously expressed in its natural cellular environment. Native 5-HT2C receptors in choroid plexus epithelial cells were evaluated using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with photon counting histogram (PCH). An anti-5-HT2C fragment antigen binding protein was used to label native 5-HT2C receptors. A known monomeric receptor (CD-86) served as a control for decoding the oligomer status of native 5-HT2C receptors by molecular brightness analysis. FCS with PCH revealed molecular brightness values for native 5-HT2C receptors equivalent to the molecular brightness of a homodimer. 5-HT2C receptors displayed a diffusion coefficient of 5 \u00d7 10(-9) cm(2)/s and were expressed at 32 receptors/\u03bcm(2) on the apical surface of choroid plexus epithelial cells. The functional significance and signaling capabilities of the homodimer were investigated in human embryonic kidney 293 cells using agonists that bind in a wash-resistant manner to one or both protomers of the homodimer. Whereas agonist binding to one protomer resulted in G protein activation, maximal stimulation required occupancy of both protomers. This study is the first to demonstrate the homodimeric structure of 5-HT2C receptors endogenously expressed in their native cellular environment, and identifies the homodimer as a functional signaling unit.",

        "Abstract": "Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) mediate the rapid release of calcium (Ca(2+)) from intracellular stores into the cytosol, which is essential for numerous cellular functions including excitation-contraction coupling in muscle. Lack of sufficient structural detail has impeded understanding of RyR gating and regulation. Here we report the closed-state structure of the 2.3-megadalton complex of the rabbit skeletal muscle type 1 RyR (RyR1), solved by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at an overall resolution of 4.8\u00a0\u00c5. We fitted a polyalanine-level model to all 3,757 ordered residues in each protomer, defining the transmembrane pore in unprecedented detail and placing all cytosolic domains as tertiary folds. The cytosolic assembly is built on an extended \u03b1-solenoid scaffold connecting key regulatory domains to the pore. The RyR1 pore architecture places it in the six-transmembrane ion channel superfamily. A unique domain inserted between the second and third transmembrane helices interacts intimately with paired EF-hands originating from the \u03b1-solenoid scaffold, suggesting a mechanism for channel gating by Ca(2+).",

Increased anomalous signals were obtained at 6\u2005keV compared with 7\u2005keV X-ray energy, which was used for previous native SAD analyses. A feasibility test of multi-crystal-based native SAD phasing was performed at 3.2\u2005\u00c5 resolution for a known tyrosine protein kinase domain, and real-life applications were made to two novel membrane proteins at about 3.0\u2005\u00c5 resolution. The three applications collectively serve to validate the robust feasibility of native SAD phasing at lower energy.",

        "Abstract": "The CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase (CDP-AP) family of integral membrane enzymes catalyses the transfer of a substituted phosphate group from a CDP-linked donor to an alcohol acceptor. This is an essential reaction for phospholipid biosynthesis across all kingdoms of life, and it is catalysed solely by CDP-APs. Here we report the 2.0 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of a representative CDP-AP from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. The enzyme (AF2299) is a homodimer, with each protomer consisting of six transmembrane helices and an N-terminal cytosolic domain. A polar cavity within the membrane accommodates the active site, lined with the residues from an absolutely conserved CDP-AP signature motif (D(1)xxD(2)G(1)xxAR...G(2)xxxD(3)xxxD(4)). Structures in the apo, CMP-bound, CDP-bound and CDP-glycerol-bound states define functional roles for each of these eight conserved residues and allow us to propose a sequential, base-catalysed mechanism universal for CDP-APs, in which the fourth aspartate (D4) acts as the catalytic base.",

        "Abstract": "Crystal structure analyses for biological macromolecules without known structural relatives entail solving the crystallographic phase problem. Typical de novo phase evaluations depend on incorporating heavier atoms than those found natively; most commonly, multi- or single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD or SAD) experiments exploit selenomethionyl proteins. Here, we realize routine structure determination using intrinsic anomalous scattering from native macromolecules. We devised robust procedures for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio in the slight anomalous scattering from generic native structures by combining data measured from multiple crystals at lower-than-usual x-ray energy. Using this multicrystal SAD method (5 to 13 equivalent crystals), we determined structures at modest resolution (2.8 to 2.3 angstroms) for native proteins varying in size (127 to 1148 unique residues) and number of sulfur sites (3 to 28). With no requirement for heavy-atom incorporation, such experiments provide an attractive alternative to selenomethionyl SAD experiments.",

Mammalian cells are often the most ideal, if not the only suitable host for such experiments. This is due to their intrinsic capability to generate functional mammalian proteins. This advantage is frequently countered by problems with yields in expression, time required to generate overexpressing lines, and elevated costs. Coexpression of multiple proteins adds another level of complexity to these experiments, as cells need to be screened and selected for expression of suitable levels of each component. Here, we present an efficient fluorescence marking procedure for establishing stable cell lines that overexpress two proteins in coordination, and we validate the method in the production of recombinant monoclonal antibody Fab fragments. This procedure may readily be expanded to systems of greater complexity, comprising more than two components.",

        "Abstract": "The New York Consortium on Membrane Protein Structure (NYCOMPS) was formed to accelerate the acquisition of structural information on membrane proteins by applying a structural genomics approach. NYCOMPS comprises a bioinformatics group, a centralized facility operating a high-throughput cloning and screening pipeline, a set of associated wet labs that perform high-level protein production and structure determination by x-ray crystallography and NMR, and a set of investigators focused on methods development. In the first three years of operation, the NYCOMPS pipeline has so far produced and screened 7,250 expression constructs for 8,045 target proteins. Approximately 600 of these verified targets were scaled up to levels required for structural studies, so far yielding 24 membrane protein crystals. Here we describe the overall structure of NYCOMPS and provide details on the high-throughput pipeline.",

        "Abstract": "High-throughput (HT) methodologies have had a tremendous impact on structural biology of soluble proteins. High-resolution structure determination relies on the ability of the macromolecule to form ordered crystals that diffract X-rays. While crystallization remains somewhat empirical, for a given protein, success is proportional to the number of conditions screened and to the number of variants trialed. HT techniques have greatly increased the number of targets that can be trialed and the rate at which these can be produced. In terms of number of structures solved, membrane proteins appear to be lagging many years behind their soluble counterparts. Likewise, HT methodologies for production and characterization of these hydrophobic macromolecules are only now emerging. Presented here is an HT platform designed exclusively for membrane proteins that has processed over 5000 targets.",

There is increasing evidence that many GPCRs exist as dimers or higher oligomers, but the biochemical nature of such dimers and what roles they have, if any, in signal transduction remains unclear. We conducted a comprehensive study of dimerization of the 5HT2c serotonin receptor using disulphide-trapping experiments. We found a dimer interface between transmembrane (TM) helices IV and V that is markedly sensitive to the state of receptor activation. This dimer seems to be quasisymmetrical in interfacial geometry and asymmetrical in its association with its cognate G alpha protein. We also found a second interface at TM I helices, which is insensitive to the state of activation.",

The procedure has worked without fail on all seven of seven trials on Fabs, which are being used in the crystallization of G-protein coupled receptors. This manner of efficient selection may readily be adapted for the co-production of other complexes of two or more proteins.",

We immunized mice with the rat 5HT2c serotonin receptor and derived clonal hybridoma cells, which we tested for specific antigen reactivity by using the complementarity of purified protein from bacteria and receptor-embedded mammalian cell membranes. Nine mAbs met our criteria for specificity, affinity, and sensitivity to conformational features. Epitopes were mapped in various additional tests. Five of the nine mAbs have cytoplasmic epitopes, and two of these are sensitive to the ligand state of the receptor. These properties should be useful both for structural analysis and in probes of function.",

        "Title": "Optimization of protein production in mammalian cells with a coexpressed fluorescent marker.",
        "Abstract": "The expression of mammalian proteins in sufficient abundance and quality for structural studies often presents formidable challenges. Many express poorly in bacterial systems, whereas it can be time consuming and expensive to produce them from cells of higher organisms. Here we describe a procedure for the direct selection of stable mammalian cell lines that express proteins of interest in high yield. Coexpression of a marker protein, such as green fluorescent protein, is linked to that of the desired protein through an internal ribosome entry site in the vector that is transfected into cells in culture. The coexpressed marker is used to select for highly expressing clonal cell lines. Applications are described to a membrane protein, the 5HT2c serotonin receptor, and to a secreted cysteine-rich protein, resistin. Besides providing an expeditious means for producing mammalian proteins for structural work, the resulting cell lines also readily support tests of functional properties and structure-inspired hypotheses.",
