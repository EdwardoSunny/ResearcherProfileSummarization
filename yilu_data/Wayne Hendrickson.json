        "Title": "Mechanistic insights into phosphoactivation of SLAC1 in guard cell signaling.",
        "Abstract": "Stomata in leaves regulate gas (carbon dioxide and water vapor) exchange and water transpiration between plants and the atmosphere. SLow Anion Channel 1 (SLAC1) mediates anion efflux from guard cells and plays a crucial role in controlling stomatal aperture. It serves as a central hub for multiple signaling pathways in response to environmental stimuli, with its activity regulated through phosphorylation via various plant protein kinases. However, the molecular mechanism underlying SLAC1 phosphoactivation has remained elusive. Through a combination of protein sequence analyses, AlphaFold-based modeling and electrophysiological studies, we unveiled that the highly conserved motifs on the N- and C-terminal segments of SLAC1 form a cytosolic regulatory domain (CRD) that interacts with the transmembrane domain(TMD), thereby maintaining the channel in an autoinhibited state. Mutations in these conserved motifs destabilize the CRD, releasing autoinhibition in SLAC1 and enabling its transition into an activated state. Our further studies demonstrated that SLAC1 activation undergoes an autoinhibition-release process and subsequent structural changes in the pore helices. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the activation mechanism of SLAC1 and shed light on understanding how SLAC1 controls stomatal closure in response to environmental stimuli.",

        "Title": "Facing the phase problem.",
        "Abstract": "The marvel of X-ray crystallography is the beauty and precision of the atomic structures deduced from diffraction patterns. Since these patterns record only amplitudes, phases for the diffracted waves must also be evaluated for systematic structure determination. Thus, we have the phase problem as a central complication, both intellectually for the field and practically so for many analyses. Here, I discuss how we - myself, my laboratory and the diffraction community - have faced the phase problem, considering the evolution of methods for phase evaluation as structural biology developed to the present day. During the explosive growth of macromolecular crystallography, practice in diffraction analysis evolved from a universal reliance on isomorphous replacement to the eventual domination of anomalous diffraction for de novo structure determination. As the Protein Data Bank (PDB) grew and familial relationships among proteins became clear, molecular replacement overtook all other phasing methods; however, experimental phasing remained essential for molecules without obvious precedents, with multi- and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD and SAD) predominating. While the mathematics-based direct methods had proved to be inadequate for typical macromolecules, they returned to crack substantial selenium substructures in SAD analyses of selenomethionyl proteins. Native SAD, exploiting the intrinsic S and P atoms of biomolecules, has become routine. Selenomethionyl SAD and MAD were the mainstays of structural genomics efforts to populate the PDB with novel proteins. A recent dividend has been paid in the success of PDB-trained artificial intelligence approaches for protein structure prediction. Currently, molecular replacement with AlphaFold models often obviates the need for experimental phase evaluation. For multiple reasons, we are now unfazed by the phase problem. Cryo-EM analysis is an attractive alternative to crystallography for many applications faced by today's structural biologists. It simply finesses the phase problem; however, the principles and procedures of diffraction analysis remain pertinent and are adopted in single-particle cryo-EM studies of biomolecules.",

        "Abstract": "Metal-mediated DNA (mmDNA) presents a pathway toward engineering bioinorganic and electronic behavior into DNA devices. Many chemical and biophysical forces drive the programmable chelation of metals between pyrimidine base pairs. Here, we developed a crystallographic method using the three-dimensional (3D) DNA tensegrity triangle motif to capture single- and multi-metal binding modes across granular changes to environmental pH using anomalous scattering. Leveraging this programmable crystal, we determined 28 biomolecular structures to capture mmDNA reactions. We found that silver(I) binds with increasing occupancy in T-T and U-U pairs at elevated pH levels, and we exploited this to capture silver(I) and mercury(II) within the same base pair and to isolate the titration points for homo- and heterometal base pair modes. We additionally determined the structure of a C-C pair with both silver(I) and mercury(II). Finally, we extend our paradigm to capture cadmium(II) in T-T pairs together with mercury(II) at high pH. The precision self-assembly of heterobimetallic DNA chemistry at the sub-nanometer scale will enable atomistic design frameworks for more elaborate mmDNA-based nanodevices and nanotechnologies.",

        "Abstract": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer on the virion surface interacts with the host receptors, CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4, to mediate virus entry into the target cell. CD4-mimetic compounds (CD4mcs) bind the gp120 Env, block CD4 binding, and inactivate Env. Previous studies suggested that a C(5)-methylamino methyl moiety on a lead CD4mc, BNM-III-170, contributed to its antiviral potency. By replacing the C(5) chain with differentially substituted pyrrolidine, piperidine, and piperazine ring systems, guided by structural and computational analyses, we found that the 5-position of BNM-III-170 is remarkably tolerant of a variety of ring sizes and substitutions, both in regard to antiviral activity and sensitization to humoral responses. Crystallographic analyses of representative analogues from the pyrrolidine series revealed the potential for 5-substituents to hydrogen bond with gp120 Env residue Thr 283. Further optimization of these interactions holds promise for the development of CD4mcs with greater potency.",

        "Abstract": "A family of leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) mediate diverse physiological responses when complexed with their cognate ligands. LGRs are present in all metazoan animals. In humans, the LGR ligands include glycoprotein hormones (GPHs) chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (hTSH). These hormones are \u03b1\u03b2 heterodimers of cystine-knot protein chains. LGRs and their ligand chains have coevolved. Ancestral hormone homologs, present in both bilaterian animals and chordates, are identified as \u03b12\u03b25. We have used single-wavelength anomalous diffraction and molecular replacement to determine structures of the \u03b12\u03b25 hormone from ",

        "Abstract": "Membrane proteins play essential roles in cellular function and metabolism. Nonetheless, biophysical and structural studies of membrane proteins are impeded by the difficulty of their expression in and purification from heterologous cell-based systems. As an alternative to these cell-based systems, cell-free protein synthesis has proven to be an exquisite method for screening membrane protein targets in a variety of lipidic mimetics. Here we report a high-throughput screening workflow and apply it to screen 61 eukaryotic membrane protein targets. For each target, we tested its expression in lipidic mimetics: two detergents, two liposomes, and two nanodiscs. We show that 35 membrane proteins (57%) can be expressed in a soluble fraction in at least one of the mimetics with the two detergents performing significantly better than nanodiscs and liposomes, in that order. Using the established cell-free workflow, we studied the production and biophysical assays for mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) complexes. Our studies show that the complexes produced in cell-free are functionally competent in complex formation and substrate binding. Our results highlight the utility of using cell-free systems for screening and production of eukaryotic membrane proteins.",

Hsp70s use ATP binding and hydrolysis at a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) to control the binding and release of client polypeptides at a substrate-binding domain (SBD); however, the mechanistic basis for this allostery has been elusive. Here, we first characterize biochemical properties of selected domain-interface mutants in bacterial Hsp70 DnaK. We then develop a theoretical model for allosteric equilibria among Hsp70 conformational states to explain the observations: a restraining state, Hsp70",

Following a broad screen of sequence space to identify initial expression-positive targets, we employ a second step to select orthologs with closely related sequences to these hits. We demonstrate that a greater percentage of these latter targets express well and are stable in detergent, increasing the likelihood of identifying candidates that will ultimately yield structural information.",

        "Abstract": "Hsp70 molecular chaperones facilitate protein disaggregation and proper folding through iterative cycles of polypeptide binding and release that are allosterically coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis. Hsp70s are ubiquitous and highly conserved across all of life; they bind ATP at an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and client peptides in the substrate-binding domain (SBD). The NBD and SBD are connected by a highly conserved linker segment that is integrated into the NBD when ATP is bound but is flexible when the NBD is nucleotide-free or bound with ADP. Allosteric coupling is lost when the linker is flexible, and the freed SBD binds peptide clients with high affinity. It was recently discovered that Hsp70-ATP is in an equilibrium between a restraining state (R) with little affinity for peptides and a low ATPase activity, and a stimulating state (S) that binds peptides efficiently, but with rapid kinetics, and has a relatively high ATPase activity. While attempting to characterize the S state, crystal structures of DnaK-ATP were obtained that demonstrate intrinsic Hsp70 plasticity that affects binding interactions with substrate peptides. These structures provide insights into intermediate states along transition pathways in the Hsp70 chaperone cycle.",

Human CCCs are clinical targets for existing diuretics and potentially additional indications. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of the soluble C-terminal regulatory domain of a eukaryotic potassium-chloride cotransporter, Caenorhabditis elegans KCC-1. We observe a core \u03b1/\u03b2 fold conserved among CCCs. Using structure-based sequence alignment, we analyze similarities and differences to the C-terminal domains of other CCC family members. We find that important regulatory motifs are in less-structured regions and residues important for dimerization are not widely conserved, suggesting that oligomerization and its effects may vary within the larger family. This snapshot of a eukaryotic KCC is a valuable starting point for the rational design of studies of cellular chloride regulation.",

        "Abstract": "Heat-shock proteins of 70 kDa (Hsp70s) are ubiquitous molecular chaperones that function in protein folding as well as other vital cellular processes. They bind and hydrolyze ATP in a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) to control the binding and release of client polypeptides in a substrate-binding domain (SBD). However, the molecular mechanism for this allosteric action has remained unclear. Here, we develop and experimentally quantify a theoretical model for Hsp70 allostery based on equilibria among Hsp70 conformational states. We postulate that, when bound to ATP, Hsp70 is in equilibrium between a restraining state (R) that restricts ATP hydrolysis and binds peptides poorly, if at all, and a stimulating state (S) that hydrolyzes ATP relatively rapidly and has high intrinsic substrate affinity but rapid binding kinetics; after the hydrolysis to ADP, NBD and SBD disengage into an uncoupled state (U) that binds peptide substrates tightly, but now with slow kinetics of exchange.",

        "Abstract": "Membrane proteins function in native cell membranes, but extraction into isolated particles is needed for many biochemical and structural analyses. Commonly used detergent-extraction methods destroy naturally associated lipid bilayers. Here, we devised a detergent-free method for preparing cell-membrane nanoparticles to study the multidrug exporter AcrB, by cryo-EM at 3.2-\u00c5 resolution. We discovered a remarkably well-organized lipid-bilayer structure associated with transmembrane domains of the AcrB trimer. This bilayer patch comprises 24 lipid molecules; inner leaflet chains are packed in a hexagonal array, whereas the outer leaflet has highly irregular but ordered packing. Protein side chains interact with both leaflets and participate in the hexagonal pattern. We suggest that the lipid bilayer supports and harmonizes peristaltic motions through AcrB trimers. In AcrB D407A, a putative proton-relay mutant, lipid bilayer buttresses protein interactions lost in crystal structures after detergent-solubilization. Our detergent-free system preserves lipid-protein interactions for visualization and should be broadly applicable.",

        "Abstract": "With the recent developments in microcrystal handling, synchrotron microdiffraction beamline instrumentation and data analysis, microcrystal crystallo-graphy with crystal sizes of less than 10\u2005\u00b5m is appealing at synchrotrons. However, challenges remain in sample manipulation and data assembly for robust microcrystal synchrotron crystallography. Here, the development of micro-sized polyimide well-mounts for the manipulation of microcrystals of a few micrometres in size and the implementation of a robust data-analysis method for the assembly of rotational microdiffraction data sets from many microcrystals are described. The method demonstrates that microcrystals may be routinely utilized for the acquisition and assembly of complete data sets from synchrotron microdiffraction beamlines.",

Typically, such recordings are performed at bandwidths of less than 10 kHz because of signal-to-noise considerations, limiting the temporal resolution available for studying fast gating dynamics to greater than 100 \u00b5s. Here we present experimental methods that directly integrate suspended lipid bilayers with high-bandwidth, low-noise transimpedance amplifiers based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits (IC) technology to achieve bandwidths in excess of 500 kHz and microsecond temporal resolution.

        "Abstract": "In 2012, preliminary guidelines were published addressing sample quality, data acquisition and reduction, presentation of scattering data and validation, and modelling for biomolecular small-angle scattering (SAS) experiments. Biomolecular SAS has since continued to grow and authors have increasingly adopted the preliminary guidelines. In parallel, integrative/hybrid determination of biomolecular structures is a rapidly growing field that is expanding the scope of structural biology. For SAS to contribute maximally to this field, it is essential to ensure open access to the information required for evaluation of the quality of SAS samples and data, as well as the validity of SAS-based structural models. To this end, the preliminary guidelines for data presentation in a publication are reviewed and updated, and the deposition of data and associated models in a public archive is recommended. These guidelines and recommendations have been prepared in consultation with the members of the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr) Small-Angle Scattering and Journals Commissions, the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) Small-Angle Scattering Validation Task Force and additional experts in the field.",

        "Abstract": "The normal elastic X-ray scattering that depends only on electron density can be modulated by an \"anomalous\" component due to resonance between X-rays and electronic orbitals. Anomalous scattering thereby precisely identifies atomic species, since orbitals distinguish atomic elements, which enables the multi- and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD and SAD) methods. SAD now predominates in de novo structure determination of biological macromolecules, and we focus here on the prevailing SAD method. We describe the anomalous phasing theory and the periodic table of phasing elements that are available for SAD experiments, differentiating between those readily accessible for at-resonance experiments and those that can be effective away from an edge. We describe procedures for present-day SAD phasing experiments and we discuss optimization of anomalous signals for challenging applications. We also describe methods for using anomalous signals as molecular markers for tracing and element identification. Emerging developments and perspectives are discussed in brief.",

        "Abstract": "The type-1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is an intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) release channel required for skeletal muscle contraction. Here, we present cryo-EM reconstructions of RyR1 in multiple functional states revealing the structural basis of channel gating and ligand-dependent activation. Binding sites for the channel activators Ca(2+), ATP, and caffeine were identified at interdomain interfaces of the C-terminal domain. Either ATP or Ca(2+) alone induces conformational changes in the cytoplasmic assembly (\"priming\"), without pore dilation. In contrast, in the presence of all three activating ligands, high-resolution reconstructions of open and closed states of RyR1 were obtained from the same sample, enabling analyses of conformational changes associated with\u00a0gating. Gating involves global conformational changes in the cytosolic assembly accompanied by local changes in the transmembrane domain, which include bending of the S6 transmembrane segment and consequent pore dilation, displacement, and deformation of the S4-S5 linker and conformational changes in the pseudo-voltage-sensor domain.",

        "Abstract": "Vitamin A homeostasis is critical to normal cellular function. Retinol-binding protein (RBP) is the sole specific carrier in the bloodstream for hydrophobic retinol, the main form in which vitamin A is transported. The integral membrane receptor STRA6 mediates cellular uptake of vitamin A by recognizing RBP-retinol to trigger release and internalization of retinol. We present the structure of zebrafish STRA6 determined to 3.9-angstrom resolution by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. STRA6 has one intramembrane and nine transmembrane helices in an intricate dimeric assembly. Unexpectedly, calmodulin is bound tightly to STRA6 in a noncanonical arrangement. Residues involved with RBP binding map to an archlike structure that covers a deep lipophilic cleft. This cleft is open to the membrane, suggesting a possible mode for internalization of retinol through direct diffusion into the lipid bilayer.",

        "Abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol is critical for intracellular signalling and anchoring of carbohydrates and proteins to outer cellular membranes. The defining step in phosphatidylinositol biosynthesis is catalysed by CDP-alcohol phosphotransferases, transmembrane enzymes that use CDP-diacylglycerol as donor substrate for this reaction, and either inositol in eukaryotes or inositol phosphate in prokaryotes as the acceptor alcohol. Here we report the structures of a related enzyme, the phosphatidylinositol-phosphate synthase from Renibacterium salmoninarum, with and without bound CDP-diacylglycerol to 3.6 and 2.5 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. These structures reveal the location of the acceptor site, and the molecular determinants of substrate specificity and catalysis. Functional characterization of the 40%-identical ortholog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a potential target for the development of novel anti-tuberculosis drugs, supports the proposed mechanism of substrate binding and catalysis. This work therefore provides a structural and functional framework to understand the mechanism of phosphatidylinositol-phosphate biosynthesis.",

        "Abstract": "The exploitation of anomalous signals for biological structural solution is maturing. Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) is dominant in de novo structure analysis. Nevertheless, for challenging structures where the resolution is low (dmin\u22653.5\u00c5) or where only lighter atoms (Z\u226420) are present, as for native macromolecules, solved SAD structures are still scarce. With the recent rapid development in crystal handling, beamline instrumentation, optimization of data collection strategies, use of multiple crystals and structure determination technologies, the weak anomalous diffraction signals are now robustly measured and should be used for routine SAD structure determination. The review covers these recent advances on weak anomalous signals measurement, analysis and utilization.",

        "Abstract": "Latrophilins (LPHNs) are adhesion-like G-protein-coupled receptors implicated in attention-deficit/hyperactivity\u00a0disorder. Recently, LPHN3 was found to regulate excitatory synapse number through trans interactions with fibronectin leucine-rich repeat transmembrane 3 (FLRT3). By isothermal titration calorimetry, we determined that only the olfactomedin (OLF) domain of LPHN3 is necessary for FLRT3 association. By multi-crystal native single-wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing, we determined the crystal structure of the OLF domain. This structure is a five-bladed \u03b2 propeller with a Ca(2+) ion bound in the central pore, which is capped by a mobile loop that allows the ion to exchange with the solvent. The crystal structure of the OLF/FLRT3 complex shows that LPHN3-OLF in the closed state binds with high affinity to the concave face of FLRT3-LRR with a combination of hydrophobic and charged residues. Our study provides structural and functional insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the contribution of LPHN3/FLRT3 to the development of glutamatergic synapses.",

TSPOs have tryptophan-rich sequences that are highly conserved from bacteria to mammals. Here we report crystal structures for Bacillus cereus TSPO (BcTSPO) down to 1.7 \u00c5 resolution, including a complex with the benzodiazepine-like inhibitor PK11195. We also describe BcTSPO-mediated protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) reactions, including catalytic degradation to a previously undescribed heme derivative. We used structure-inspired mutations to investigate reaction mechanisms, and we showed that TSPOs from Xenopus and man have similar PpIX-directed activities. Although TSPOs have been regarded as transporters, the catalytic activity in PpIX degradation suggests physiological importance for TSPOs in protection against oxidative stress.",

        "Abstract": "The extensively studied cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is involved in the regulation of critical cell processes, including metabolism, gene expression, and cell proliferation; consequentially, mis-regulation of PKA signaling is implicated in tumorigenesis. Recent genomic studies have identified recurrent mutations in the catalytic subunit of PKA in tumors associated with Cushing's syndrome, a kidney disorder leading to excessive cortisol production, and also in tumors associated with fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC), a rare liver cancer. Expression of a L205R point mutant and a DnaJ-PKA fusion protein were found to be linked to Cushing's syndrome and FL-HCC, respectively. Here we reveal contrasting mechanisms for increased PKA signaling at the molecular level through structural determination and biochemical characterization of the aberrant enzymes. In the Cushing's syndrome disorder, we find that the L205R mutation abolishes regulatory-subunit binding, leading to constitutive, cAMP-independent signaling. In FL-HCC, the DnaJ-PKA chimera remains under regulatory subunit control; however, its overexpression from the DnaJ promoter leads to enhanced cAMP-dependent signaling. Our findings provide a structural understanding of the two distinct disease mechanisms and they offer a basis for designing effective drugs for their treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Ca(2+)-activated chloride currents carried via transmembrane proteins TMEM16A and TMEM16B regulate diverse processes including mucus secretion, neuronal excitability, smooth muscle contraction, olfactory signal transduction, and cell proliferation. Understanding how TMEM16A/16B are regulated by Ca(2+) is critical for defining their (patho)/physiological roles and for rationally targeting them therapeutically. Here, using a bioengineering approach--channel inactivation induced by membrane-tethering of an associated protein (ChIMP)--we discovered that Ca(2+)-free calmodulin (apoCaM) is preassociated with TMEM16A/16B channel complexes. The resident apoCaM mediates two distinct Ca(2+)-dependent effects on TMEM16A, as revealed by expression of dominant-negative CaM1234. These effects are Ca(2+)-dependent sensitization of activation (CDSA) and Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation (CDI). CDI and CDSA are independently mediated by the N and C lobes of CaM, respectively. TMEM16A alternative splicing provides a mechanism for tuning apoCaM effects. Channels lacking splice segment b selectively lost CDI, and segment a is necessary for apoCaM preassociation with TMEM16A. The results reveal multidimensional regulation of TMEM16A/16B by preassociated apoCaM and introduce ChIMP as a versatile tool to probe the macromolecular complex and function of Ca(2+)-activated chloride channels.",

        "Abstract": "Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) mediate the rapid release of calcium (Ca(2+)) from intracellular stores into the cytosol, which is essential for numerous cellular functions including excitation-contraction coupling in muscle. Lack of sufficient structural detail has impeded understanding of RyR gating and regulation. Here we report the closed-state structure of the 2.3-megadalton complex of the rabbit skeletal muscle type 1 RyR (RyR1), solved by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at an overall resolution of 4.8\u00a0\u00c5. We fitted a polyalanine-level model to all 3,757 ordered residues in each protomer, defining the transmembrane pore in unprecedented detail and placing all cytosolic domains as tertiary folds. The cytosolic assembly is built on an extended \u03b1-solenoid scaffold connecting key regulatory domains to the pore. The RyR1 pore architecture places it in the six-transmembrane ion channel superfamily. A unique domain inserted between the second and third transmembrane helices interacts intimately with paired EF-hands originating from the \u03b1-solenoid scaffold, suggesting a mechanism for channel gating by Ca(2+).",

We describe the structure of a bacterial homolog (KpBest) of hBest1 and functional characterizations of both channels. KpBest is a pentamer that forms a five-helix transmembrane pore, closed by three rings of conserved hydrophobic residues, and has a cytoplasmic cavern with a restricted exit. From electrophysiological analysis of structure-inspired mutations in KpBest and hBest1, we find a sensitive control of ion selectivity in the bestrophins, including reversal of anion/cation selectivity, and dramatic activation by mutations at the cytoplasmic exit. A homology model of hBest1 shows the locations of disease-causing mutations and suggests possible roles in regulation.",

        "Abstract": "Anomalous diffraction signals from typical native macromolecules are very weak, frustrating their use in de novo structure determination. Here, native SAD procedures are described to enhance signal to noise in anomalous diffraction by using multiple crystals in combination with synchrotron X-rays at 6\u2005keV. Increased anomalous signals were obtained at 6\u2005keV compared with 7\u2005keV X-ray energy, which was used for previous native SAD analyses. A feasibility test of multi-crystal-based native SAD phasing was performed at 3.2\u2005\u00c5 resolution for a known tyrosine protein kinase domain, and real-life applications were made to two novel membrane proteins at about 3.0\u2005\u00c5 resolution. The three applications collectively serve to validate the robust feasibility of native SAD phasing at lower energy.",

        "Abstract": "The adult human gut is a complicated ecosystem in which host-bacterium symbiosis plays an important role. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is a predominant member of the gut microflora, providing the human digestive tract with a large number of glycolytic enzymes. Expression of many of these enzymes appears to be controlled by histidine kinase receptors that are fused into unusual hybrid two-component systems that share homologous periplasmic sensor domains. These sensor domains belong to the third most populated (HK3) family based on a previous unpublished bioinformatics analysis of predicted histidine kinase sensors. Here, we present the crystal structures of two sensor domains representative of the HK3 family. Each sensor is folded into three domains: two-seven-bladed \u03b2-propeller domains and one \u03b2-sandwich domain. Both sensors form dimers in crystals, and one sensor appears to be physiologically relevant. The folding characteristics in the individual domains, the domain organization, and the oligomeric architecture are all unique to HK3 sensors. Sequence analysis of the HK3 sensors indicates that these sensor domains are shared among other signaling molecules, implying combinatorial molecular evolution.",

Human Bax inhibitor-1 (hBI-1) is an antiapoptotic protein that mediates a calcium leak and is representative of a highly conserved and widely distributed family, the transmembrane Bax inhibitor motif (TMBIM) proteins. Here, we present crystal structures of a bacterial homolog and characterize its calcium leak activity. The structure has a seven-transmembrane-helix fold that features two triple-helix sandwiches wrapped around a central C-terminal helix. Structures obtained in closed and open conformations are reversibly interconvertible by change of pH. A hydrogen-bonded, pKa (where Ka is the acid dissociation constant)-perturbed pair of conserved aspartate residues explains the pH dependence of this transition, and biochemical studies show that pH regulates calcium influx in proteoliposomes. Homology models for hBI-1 provide insights into TMBIM-mediated calcium leak and cytoprotective activity.",

        "Abstract": "X-ray diffraction patterns from crystals of biological macromolecules contain sufficient information to define atomic structures, but atomic positions are inextricable without having electron-density images. Diffraction measurements provide amplitudes, but the computation of electron density also requires phases for the diffracted waves. The resonance phenomenon known as anomalous scattering offers a powerful solution to this phase problem. Exploiting scattering resonances from diverse elements, the methods of MAD (multiwavelength anomalous diffraction) and SAD (single-wavelength anomalous diffraction) now predominate for de novo determinations of atomic-level biological structures. This review describes the physical underpinnings of anomalous diffraction methods, the evolution of these methods to their current maturity, the elements, procedures and instrumentation used for effective implementation, and the realm of applications.",

        "Title": "Structure-based design, synthesis and validation of CD4-mimetic small molecule inhibitors of HIV-1 entry: conversion of a viral entry agonist to an antagonist.",
        "Abstract": "This Account provides an overview of a multidisciplinary consortium focused on structure-based strategies to devise small molecule antagonists of HIV-1 entry into human T-cells, which if successful would hold considerable promise for the development of prophylactic modalities to prevent HIV transmission and thereby alter the course of the AIDS pandemic. Entry of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into target T-cells entails an interaction between CD4 on the host T-cell and gp120, a component of the trimeric envelope glycoprotein spike on the virion surface. The resultant interaction initiates a series of conformational changes within the envelope spike that permits binding to a chemokine receptor, formation of the gp41 fusion complex, and cell entry. A hydrophobic cavity at the CD4-gp120 interface, defined by X-ray crystallography, provided an initial site for small molecule antagonist design. This site however has evolved to facilitate viral entry. As such, the binding of prospective small molecule inhibitors within this gp120 cavity can inadvertently trigger an allosteric entry signal. Structural characterization of the CD4-gp120 interface, which provided the foundation for small molecule structure-based inhibitor design, will be presented first. An integrated approach combining biochemical, virological, structural, computational, and synthetic studies, along with a detailed analysis of ligand binding energetics, revealed that modestly active small molecule inhibitors of HIV entry can also promote viral entry into cells lacking the CD4 receptor protein; these competitive inhibitors were termed small molecule CD4 mimetics. Related congeners were subsequently identified with both improved binding affinity and more potent viral entry inhibition. Further assessment of the affinity-enhanced small molecule CD4 mimetics demonstrated that premature initiation of conformational change within the viral envelope spike, prior to cell encounter, can lead to irreversible deactivation of viral entry machinery. Related congeners, which bind the same gp120 site, possess different propensities to elicit the allosteric response that underlies the undesired enhancement of CD4-independent viral entry. Subsequently, key hotspots in the CD4-gp120 interface were categorized using mutagenesis and isothermal titration calorimetry according to the capacity to increase binding affinity without triggering the allosteric signal. This analysis, combined with cocrystal structures of small molecule viral entry agonists with gp120, led to the development of fully functional antagonists of HIV-1 entry. Additional structure-based design exploiting two hotspots followed by synthesis has now yielded low micromolar inhibitors of viral entry.",

        "Abstract": "Structure determinations for biological macromolecules that have no known structural antecedents typically involve the incorporation of heavier atoms than those found natively in biological molecules. Currently, selenomethionyl proteins analyzed using single- or multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD or MAD) data predominate for such de novo analyses. Naturally occurring metal ions such as zinc or iron often suffice in MAD or SAD experiments, and sulfur SAD has been an option since it was first demonstrated using crambin 30 years ago; however, SAD analyses of structures containing only light atoms (Zmax \u2264 20) have not been common. Here, robust procedures for enhancing the signal to noise in measurements of anomalous diffraction by combining data collected from several crystals at a lower than usual X-ray energy are described. This multi-crystal native SAD method was applied in five structure determinations, using between five and 13 crystals to determine substructures of between four and 52 anomalous scatterers (Z \u2264 20) and then the full structures ranging from 127 to 1200 ordered residues per asymmetric unit at resolutions from 2.3 to 2.8\u2005\u00c5. Tests were devised to assure that all of the crystals used were statistically equivalent. Elemental identities for Ca, Cl, S, P and Mg were proven by f'' scattering-factor refinements. The procedures are robust, indicating that truly routine structure determination of typical native macromolecules is realised. Synchrotron beamlines that are optimized for low-energy X-ray diffraction measurements will facilitate such direct structural analysis.",

        "Abstract": "This report presents the conclusions of the July 12-13, 2012 meeting of the Small-Angle Scattering Task Force of the worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB; Berman et\u00a0al., 2003) at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The task force includes experts in small-angle scattering (SAS), crystallography, data archiving, and molecular modeling who met to consider questions regarding the contributions of SAS to modern structural biology. Recognizing there is a rapidly growing community of structural biology researchers acquiring and interpreting SAS data in terms of increasingly sophisticated molecular models, the task force recommends that (1) a global repository is needed that holds standard format X-ray and neutron SAS data that is searchable and freely accessible for download; (2) a standard dictionary is required for definitions of terms for data collection and for managing the SAS data repository; (3) options should be provided for including in the repository SAS-derived shape and atomistic models based on rigid-body refinement against SAS data along with specific information regarding the uniqueness and uncertainty of the model, and the protocol used to obtain it; (4) criteria need to be agreed upon for assessment of the quality of deposited SAS data and the accuracy of SAS-derived models, and the extent to which a given model fits the SAS data; (5) with the increasing diversity of structural biology data and models being generated, archiving options for models derived from diverse data will be required; and (6) thought leaders from the various structural biology disciplines should jointly define what to archive in the PDB and what complementary archives might be needed, taking into account both scientific needs and funding.",

        "Abstract": "The 70-kilodalton (kDa) heat-shock proteins (Hsp70s) are ubiquitous molecular chaperones essential for cellular protein folding and proteostasis. Each Hsp70 has two functional domains: a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), which binds and hydrolyzes ATP, and a substrate-binding domain (SBD), which binds extended polypeptides. NBD and SBD interact little when in the presence of ADP; however, ATP binding allosterically couples the polypeptide- and ATP-binding sites. ATP binding promotes polypeptide release; polypeptide rebinding stimulates ATP hydrolysis. This allosteric coupling is poorly understood. Here we present the crystal structure of an intact ATP-bound Hsp70 from Escherichia coli at 1.96-\u00c5 resolution. The ATP-bound NBD adopts a unique conformation, forming extensive interfaces with an SBD that has changed radically, having its \u03b1-helical lid displaced and the polypeptide-binding channel of its \u03b2-subdomain restructured. These conformational changes, together with our biochemical assays, provide a structural explanation for allosteric coupling in Hsp70 activity.",

        "Abstract": "The neuronal isoform of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB) is a regulator of local protein synthesis at synapses and is critical in maintaining learning-related synaptic plasticity in Aplysia. Previous studies indicate that the function of Aplysia CPEB can be modulated by conversion to a stable prion-like state, thus contributing to the stabilization of long-term memory on a molecular level. Here, we used biophysical methods to demonstrate that Aplysia CPEB, like other prions, undergoes a conformational switch from soluble \u03b1-helix-rich oligomer to \u03b2-sheet-rich fiber in vitro. Solid-state NMR analyses of the fibers indicated a relatively rigid N-terminal prion domain. The fiber form of Aplysia CPEB showed enhanced binding to target mRNAs as compared to the soluble form. Consequently, we propose a model for the Aplysia CPEB fibers that may have relevance for functional prions in general.",

        "Abstract": "HIV envelope glycoproteins undergo large-scale conformational changes as they interact with cellular receptors to cause the fusion of viral and cellular membranes that permits viral entry to infect targeted cells. Conformational dynamics in HIV gp120 are also important in masking conserved receptor epitopes from being detected for effective neutralization by the human immune system. Crystal structures of HIV gp120 and its complexes with receptors and antibody fragments provide high-resolution pictures of selected conformational states accessible to gp120. Here we describe systematic computational analyses of HIV gp120 plasticity in such complexes with CD4 binding fragments, CD4 mimetic proteins, and various antibody fragments. We used three computational approaches: an isotropic elastic network analysis of conformational plasticity, a full atomic normal mode analysis, and simulation of conformational transitions with our coarse-grained virtual atom molecular mechanics (VAMM) potential function. We observe collective sub-domain motions about hinge points that coordinate those motions, correlated local fluctuations at the interfacial cavity formed when gp120 binds to CD4, and concerted changes in structural elements that form at the CD4 interface during large-scale conformational transitions to the CD4-bound state from the deformed states of gp120 in certain antibody complexes.",

        "Abstract": "Since the discovery more than 30 years ago of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the causative agent of the deadly disease, acquired immune deficiency disease (AIDS), there have been no efficient vaccines against the virus. For the infection of the virus, the HIV surface glycoprotein gp120 first recognizes the CD4 receptor on the target helper T-cell, which initiates HIV fusion with the target cell and, if unchecked, leads to destruction of the patient's immune system. Despite the difficulty of developing appropriate immune responses in HIV-infected individuals, patient sera often contain antibodies that have broad neutralization activity, indicating the possibility of immunological treatment and prevention. Recently, through extensive structural studies of neutralizing antibodies of HIV in complex with gp120, the critical mechanisms of broad neutralization against HIV have been elucidated. Based on these discoveries, the structure-aided designs of antibodies and novel scaffolds were performed to create extremely potent neutralizing antibodies against HIV. These new discoveries and advances shed light on the road to development of efficient immunological therapies against AIDS.",

        "Abstract": "Crystal structure analyses for biological macromolecules without known structural relatives entail solving the crystallographic phase problem. Typical de novo phase evaluations depend on incorporating heavier atoms than those found natively; most commonly, multi- or single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD or SAD) experiments exploit selenomethionyl proteins. Here, we realize routine structure determination using intrinsic anomalous scattering from native macromolecules. We devised robust procedures for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio in the slight anomalous scattering from generic native structures by combining data measured from multiple crystals at lower-than-usual x-ray energy. Using this multicrystal SAD method (5 to 13 equivalent crystals), we determined structures at modest resolution (2.8 to 2.3 angstroms) for native proteins varying in size (127 to 1148 unique residues) and number of sulfur sites (3 to 28). With no requirement for heavy-atom incorporation, such experiments provide an attractive alternative to selenomethionyl SAD experiments.",

        "Abstract": "The osmoregulator trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), commonplace in aquatic organisms, is used as the terminal electron acceptor for respiration in many bacterial species. The TMAO reductase (Tor) pathway for respiratory catalysis is controlled by a receptor system that comprises the TMAO-binding protein TorT, the sensor histidine kinase TorS, and the response regulator TorR. Here we study the TorS/TorT sensor system to gain mechanistic insight into signaling by histidine kinase receptors. We determined crystal structures for complexes of TorS sensor domains with apo TorT and with TorT (TMAO); we characterized TorS sensor associations with TorT in solution; we analyzed the thermodynamics of TMAO binding to TorT-TorS complexes; and we analyzed in vivo responses to TMAO through the TorT/TorS/TorR system to test structure-inspired hypotheses. TorS-TorT(apo) is an asymmetric 2:2 complex that binds TMAO with negative cooperativity to form a symmetric active kinase.",

        "Abstract": "Structural and functional studies of many mammalian systems are critically dependent on abundant supplies of recombinant multiprotein complexes. Mammalian cells are often the most ideal, if not the only suitable host for such experiments. This is due to their intrinsic capability to generate functional mammalian proteins. This advantage is frequently countered by problems with yields in expression, time required to generate overexpressing lines, and elevated costs. Coexpression of multiple proteins adds another level of complexity to these experiments, as cells need to be screened and selected for expression of suitable levels of each component. Here, we present an efficient fluorescence marking procedure for establishing stable cell lines that overexpress two proteins in coordination, and we validate the method in the production of recombinant monoclonal antibody Fab fragments. This procedure may readily be expanded to systems of greater complexity, comprising more than two components.",

Whereas several saccharide uptake systems are shared between the different phylogenetic kingdoms, the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system exists almost exclusively in bacteria. This multi-component system includes an integral membrane protein EIIC that transports saccharides and assists in their phosphorylation. Here we present the crystal structure of an EIIC from Bacillus cereus that transports diacetylchitobiose. The EIIC is a homodimer, with an expansive interface formed between the amino-terminal halves of the two protomers. The carboxy-terminal half of each protomer has a large binding pocket that contains a diacetylchitobiose, which is occluded from both sides of the membrane with its site of phosphorylation near the conserved His250 and Glu334 residues. The structure shows the architecture of this important class of transporters, identifies the determinants of substrate binding and phosphorylation, and provides a framework for understanding the mechanism of sugar translocation.",

        "Abstract": "Folding and trafficking of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family members, which play essential roles in development and homeostasis, are mediated by specific chaperones. The Boca/Mesd chaperone family specifically promotes folding and trafficking of the YWTD \u03b2 propeller-EGF domain pair found in the ectodomain of all LDLR members. Limited proteolysis, NMR spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and X-ray crystallography were used to define a conserved core composed of a structured domain that is preceded by a disordered N-terminal region. High-resolution structures of the ordered domain were determined for homologous proteins from three metazoans. Seven independent protomers reveal a novel ferrodoxin-like superfamily fold with two distinct \u03b2 sheet topologies. A conserved hydrophobic surface forms a dimer interface in each crystal, but these differ substantially at the atomic level, indicative of nonspecific hydrophobic interactions that may play a role in the chaperone activity of the Boca/Mesd family.",

Here we present the crystal structure of a TrkH from Vibrio parahaemolyticus. TrkH is a homodimer, and each protomer contains an ion permeation pathway. A selectivity filter, similar in architecture to those of K(+) channels but significantly shorter, is lined by backbone and side-chain oxygen atoms. Functional studies showed that TrkH is selective for permeation of K(+) and Rb(+) over smaller ions such as Na(+) or Li(+). Immediately intracellular to the selectivity filter are an intramembrane loop and an arginine residue, both highly conserved, which constrict the permeation pathway. Substituting the arginine with an alanine significantly increases the rate of K(+) flux. These results reveal the molecular basis of K(+) selectivity and suggest a novel gating mechanism for this large and important family of membrane transport proteins.",

        "Abstract": "In the cell, protein folding is mediated by folding catalysts and chaperones. The two functions are often linked, especially when the catalytic module forms part of a multidomain protein, as in Methanococcus jannaschii peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase FKBP26. Here, we show that FKBP26 chaperone activity requires both a 50-residue insertion in the catalytic FKBP domain, also called 'Insert-in-Flap' or IF domain, and an 80-residue C-terminal domain. We determined FKBP26 structures from four crystal forms and analyzed chaperone domains in light of their ability to mediate protein-protein interactions. FKBP26 is a crescent-shaped homodimer. We reason that folding proteins are bound inside the large crescent cleft, thus enabling their access to inward-facing peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase catalytic sites and ipsilateral chaperone domain surfaces. As these chaperone surfaces participate extensively in crystal lattice contacts, we speculate that the observed lattice contacts reflect a proclivity for protein associations and represent substrate interactions by FKBP26 chaperone domains. Finally, we find that FKBP26 is an exceptionally flexible molecule, suggesting a mechanism for nonspecific substrate recognition.",

        "Abstract": "Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) are the two most commonly used methods for de novo determination of macromolecular structures. Both methods rely on the accurate extraction of anomalous signals; however, because of factors such as poor intrinsic order, radiation damage, inadequate anomalous scatterers, poor diffraction quality and other noise-causing factors, the anomalous signal from a single crystal is not always good enough for structure solution. In this study, procedures for extracting more accurate anomalous signals by merging data from multiple crystals are devised and tested. SAD phasing tests were made with a relatively large (1456 ordered residues) poorly diffracting (d(min) = 3.5\u2005\u00c5) selenomethionyl protein (20 Se). It is quantified that the anomalous signal, success in substructure determination and accuracy of phases and electron-density maps all improve with an increase in the number of crystals used in merging. Structure solutions are possible when no single crystal can support structural analysis. It is proposed that such multi-crystal strategies may be broadly useful when only weak anomalous signals are available.",

        "Abstract": "The functional switch of glutamine/asparagine (Q/N)-rich prions and the neurotoxicity of polyQ-expanded proteins involve complex aggregation-prone structural transitions, commonly presumed to be forming \u03b2 sheets. By analyzing sequences of interaction partners of these proteins, we discovered a recurrent presence of coiled-coil domains both in the partners and in segments that flank or overlap Q/N-rich and polyQ domains. Since coiled coils can mediate protein interactions and multimerization, we studied their possible involvement in Q/N-rich and polyQ aggregations. Using circular dichroism and chemical crosslinking, we found that Q/N-rich and polyQ peptides form \u03b1-helical coiled coils in\u00a0vitro and assemble into multimers. Using structure-guided mutagenesis, we found that coiled-coil domains modulate in\u00a0vivo properties of two Q/N-rich prions and polyQ-expanded huntingtin. Mutations that disrupt coiled coils impair aggregation and activity, whereas mutations that enhance coiled-coil propensity promote aggregation. These findings support a coiled-coil model for the functional switch of Q/N-rich prions and for the pathogenesis of polyQ-expansion diseases.",

Here we determine the crystal structure of a bacterial homologue (Haemophilus influenzae) of SLAC1 at 1.20 \u00c5 resolution, and use structure-inspired mutagenesis to analyse the conductance properties of SLAC1 channels. SLAC1 is a symmetrical trimer composed from quasi-symmetrical subunits, each having ten transmembrane helices arranged from helical hairpin pairs to form a central five-helix transmembrane pore that is gated by an extremely conserved phenylalanine residue. Conformational features indicate a mechanism for control of gating by kinase activation, and electrostatic features of the pore coupled with electrophysiological characteristics indicate that selectivity among different anions is largely a function of the energetic cost of ion dehydration.",

        "Abstract": "Histidine kinase (HK) receptors are used ubiquitously by bacteria to monitor environmental changes, and they are also prevalent in plants, fungi, and other protists. Typical HK receptors have an extracellular sensor portion that detects a signal, usually a chemical ligand, and an intracellular transmitter portion that includes both the kinase domain itself and the site for histidine phosphorylation. While kinase domains are highly conserved, sensor domains are diverse. HK receptors function as dimers, but the molecular mechanism for signal transduction across cell membranes remains obscure. In this study, eight crystal structures were determined from five sensor domains representative of the most populated family, family HK1, found in a bioinformatic analysis of predicted sensor domains from transmembrane HKs. Each structure contains an inserted repeat of PhoQ/DcuS/CitA (PDC) domains, and similarity between sequence and structure is correlated across these and other double-PDC sensor proteins. Three of the five sensors crystallize as dimers that appear to be physiologically relevant, and comparisons between ligated structures and apo-state structures provide insights into signal transmission. Some HK1 family proteins prove to be sensors for chemotaxis proteins or diguanylate cyclase receptors, implying a combinatorial molecular evolution.",

Histidine kinases, often membrane associated, detect environmental input at sensor domains and propagate resulting signals to catalytic cytoplasmic transmitter domains. Recent studies on the great diversity of sensor domains reveal patterns of domain organization and biochemical properties that provide insight into mechanisms of signaling. Despite the enormous sequence variability found within sensor input domains, they fall into a relatively small number of discrete structural classes. Subtle rearrangements along a structurally labile dimer interface, in the form of possible sliding or rotational motions, are propagated from the sensor domain to the transmitter domain to modulate activity of the receptor.",

        "Abstract": "The New York Consortium on Membrane Protein Structure (NYCOMPS), a part of the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) in the USA, has as its mission to establish a high-throughput pipeline for determination of novel integral membrane protein structures. Here we describe our current target selection protocol, which applies structural genomics approaches informed by the collective experience of our team of investigators. We first extract all annotated proteins from our reagent genomes, i.e. the 96 fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes from which we clone DNA. We filter this initial pool of sequences and obtain a list of valid targets. NYCOMPS defines valid targets as those that, among other features, have at least two predicted transmembrane helices, no predicted long disordered regions and, except for community nominated targets, no significant sequence similarity in the predicted transmembrane region to any known protein structure. Proteins that feed our experimental pipeline are selected by defining a protein seed and searching the set of all valid targets for proteins that are likely to have a transmembrane region structurally similar to that of the seed. We require sequence similarity aligning at least half of the predicted transmembrane region of seed and target. Seeds are selected according to their feasibility and/or biological interest, and they include both centrally selected targets and community nominated targets. As of December 2008, over 6,000 targets have been selected and are currently being processed by the experimental pipeline. We discuss how our target list may impact structural coverage of the membrane protein space.",

Each receptor is part of a two-component system that regulates a particular cellular process. Organisms that use trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) as a terminal electron acceptor typically control their anaerobic respiration through the TMAO reductase (Tor) pathway, which the TorS histidine kinase activates when sensing TMAO in the environment. We have determined crystal structures for the periplasmic sensor domains of TorS receptors from Escherichia coli and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. TorS sensor domains have a novel fold consisting of a membrane-proximal right-handed four-helical bundle and a membrane-distal left-handed four-helical bundle, but conformational dispositions differ significantly in the two structures. Isolated TorS sensor domains dimerize in solution; and from comparisons with dimeric NarX and Tar sensors, we postulate that signaling through TorS dimers involves a piston-type displacement between helices.",

In vitro studies show that TF promotes protein refolding. We find here that ribosome-free TF stably associates with and rescues from misfolding a large repertoire of full-length proteins. We identify over 170 members of this cytosolic Escherichia coli TF substrate proteome, including ribosomal protein S7. We analyzed the biochemical properties of a TF:S7 complex from Thermotoga maritima and determined its crystal structure. Thereby, we obtained an atomic-level picture of a promiscuous chaperone in complex with a physiological substrate protein. The structure of the complex reveals the molecular basis of substrate recognition by TF, indicates how TF could accelerate protein folding, and suggests a role for TF in the biogenesis of protein complexes.",

        "Abstract": "Activities of many biological macromolecules involve large conformational transitions for which crystallography can specify atomic details of alternative end states, but the course of transitions is often beyond the reach of computations based on full-atomic potential functions. We have developed a coarse-grained force field for molecular mechanics calculations based on the virtual interactions of C alpha atoms in protein molecules. This force field is parameterized based on the statistical distribution of the energy terms extracted from crystallographic data, and it is formulated to capture features dependent on secondary structure and on residue-specific contact information. The resulting force field is applied to energy minimization and normal mode analysis of several proteins. We find robust convergence in minimizations to low energies and energy gradients with low degrees of structural distortion, and atomic fluctuations calculated from the normal mode analyses correlate well with the experimental B-factors obtained from high-resolution crystal structures. These findings suggest that the virtual atom force field is a suitable tool for various molecular mechanics applications on large macromolecular systems undergoing large conformational changes.",

        "Abstract": "Many proteins function through conformational transitions between structurally disparate states, and there is a need to explore transition pathways between experimentally accessible states by computation. The sizes of systems of interest and the scale of conformational changes are often beyond the scope of full atomic models, but appropriate coarse-grained approaches can capture significant features. We have designed a comprehensive knowledge-based potential function based on a C alpha representation for proteins that we call the virtual atom molecular mechanics (VAMM) force field. Here, we describe an algorithm for using the VAMM potential to describe conformational transitions, and we validate this algorithm in application to a transition between open and closed states of adenylate kinase (ADK). The VAMM algorithm computes normal modes for each state and iteratively moves each structure toward the other through a series of intermediates. The move from each side at each step is taken along that normal mode showing greatest engagement with the other state. The process continues to convergence of terminal intermediates to within a defined limit--here, a root-mean-square deviation of 1 A. Validations show that the VAMM algorithm is highly effective, and the transition pathways examined for ADK are compatible with other structural and biophysical information. We expect that the VAMM algorithm can address many biological systems.",

        "Abstract": "Histidine kinase receptors are a large family of membrane-spanning proteins found in many prokaryotes and some eukaryotes. They are a part of two-component signal transduction systems, which each comprise a sensor kinase and a response regulator and are involved with the regulation of many cellular processes. NarX is a histidine kinase receptor that responds to nitrate and nitrite to effect regulation of anaerobic respiration in various bacteria. We present high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the periplasmic sensor domain from Escherichia coli NarX in a complex with nitrate and in the apo state. Our analysis reveals that nitrate-binding induces conformation changes that result in a piston-type displacement between the N- and C-terminal helices of the periplasmic domain. Such conformational changes might represent a conserved mechanism of signaling in histidine kinases by which ligand binding is communicated across the lipid bilayer.",

        "Abstract": "Membrane fusion between vesicles and target membranes involves the zippering of a four-helix bundle generated by constituent helices derived from target- and vesicle-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs). In neurons, the protein complexin clamps otherwise spontaneous fusion by SNARE proteins, allowing neurotransmitters and other mediators to be secreted when and where they are needed as this clamp is released. The membrane-proximal accessory helix of complexin is necessary for clamping, but its mechanism of action is unknown. Here, we present experiments using a reconstituted fusion system that suggest a simple model in which the complexin accessory helix forms an alternative four-helix bundle with the target-SNARE near the membrane, preventing the vesicle-SNARE from completing its zippering.",

        "Abstract": "Two-component signaling systems allow bacteria to adapt to changing environments. Typically, a chemical or other stimulus is detected by the periplasmic sensor domain of a transmembrane histidine kinase sensor, which in turn relays a signal through a phosphotransfer cascade to the cognate cytoplasmic response regulator. Such systems lead ultimately to changes in gene expression or cell motility. Mechanisms of ligand binding and signal transduction through the cell membrane in histidine kinases are not fully understood. In an effort to further understand such processes, we have solved the crystal structures of the periplasmic sensor domains of Escherichia coli DcuS and of Vibrio cholerae DctB in complex with the respective cognate ligands, malate and succinate. Both proteins are involved in the regulation of the transport and metabolism of C(4)-dicarboxylates, but they are not highly related by sequence similarity. Our work reveals that despite disparate sizes, both structures contain a similar characteristic alpha/beta PDC (PhoQ-DcuS-CitA) sensor-domain fold and display similar modes of ligand binding, suggesting similar mechanisms of function.",

        "Title": "Crystal structure of a functional dimer of the PhoQ sensor domain.",
        "Abstract": "The PhoP-PhoQ two-component system is a well studied bacterial signaling system that regulates virulence and stress response. Catalytic activity of the histidine kinase sensor protein PhoQ is activated by low extracellular concentrations of divalent cations such as Mg2+, and subsequently the response regulator PhoP is activated in turn through a classic phosphotransfer pathway that is typical in such systems. The PhoQ sensor domains of enteric bacteria contain an acidic cluster of residues (EDDDDAE) that has been implicated in direct binding to divalent cations. We have determined crystal structures of the wild-type Escherichia coli PhoQ periplasmic sensor domain and of a mutant variant in which the acidic cluster was neutralized to conservative uncharged residues (QNNNNAQ). The PhoQ domain structure is similar to that of DcuS and CitA sensor domains, and this PhoQ-DcuS-CitA (PDC) sensor fold is seen to be distinct from the superficially similar PAS domain fold. Analysis of the wild-type structure reveals a dimer that allows for the formation of a salt bridge across the dimer interface between Arg-50' and Asp-179 and with nickel ions bound to aspartate residues in the acidic cluster. The physiological importance of the salt bridge to in vivo PhoQ function has been confirmed by mutagenesis. The mutant structure has an alternative, non-physiological dimeric association.",

There is increasing evidence that many GPCRs exist as dimers or higher oligomers, but the biochemical nature of such dimers and what roles they have, if any, in signal transduction remains unclear. We conducted a comprehensive study of dimerization of the 5HT2c serotonin receptor using disulphide-trapping experiments. We found a dimer interface between transmembrane (TM) helices IV and V that is markedly sensitive to the state of receptor activation. This dimer seems to be quasisymmetrical in interfacial geometry and asymmetrical in its association with its cognate G alpha protein. We also found a second interface at TM I helices, which is insensitive to the state of activation.",

        "Abstract": "Proteins with leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) specialize in mediating protein-protein interactions. The hormone binding portion of the receptor for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is an LRR protein by sequence, and the crystal structure of this domain from human FSH receptor in a complex with FSH shows that it does indeed have an LRR structure. It differs from other LRR domains, however, in being an all-beta protein composed of highly irregular repeats and having only slight overall curvature. Despite these distinctions and a superficial resemblance to beta-helical proteins, the binding domain of FSH receptor clearly is an LRR protein. The structure does consist of two parts with distinctively different curvatures. Comparison with the structures of other LRR-containing proteins shows a correlation between curvature and main-chain hydrogen bonding pattern of the parallel beta-sheet. The hormone-binding site is located at the concave surface of the receptor structure, a feature common to proteins with LRR motifs. Analysis of the ligand-binding site of LRR-containing proteins reveals that they generally utilize extensive interface area and a large number of charged residues to facilitate high-affinity protein-protein interactions.",

        "Abstract": "Classic Hsp70 chaperones assist in diverse processes of protein folding and translocation, and Hsp110s had seemed by sequence to be distant relatives within an Hsp70 superfamily. The 2.4 A resolution structure of Sse1 with ATP shows that Hsp110s are indeed Hsp70 relatives, and it provides insight into allosteric coupling between sites for ATP and polypeptide-substrate binding in Hsp70s. Subdomain structures are similar in intact Sse1(ATP) and in the separate Hsp70 domains, but conformational dispositions are radically different. Interfaces between Sse1 domains are extensive, intimate, and conservative in sequence with Hsp70s. We propose that Sse1(ATP) may be an evolutionary vestige of the Hsp70(ATP) state, and an analysis of 64 mutant variants in Sse1 and three Hsp70 homologs supports this hypothesis. An atomic-level understanding of Hsp70 communication between ATP and substrate-binding domains follows. Requirements on Sse1 for yeast viability are in keeping with the distinct function of Hsp110s as nucleotide exchange factors.",

        "Abstract": "The first step in HIV infection is the binding of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 to the host cell receptor CD4. An interfacial \"Phe43 cavity\" in gp120, adjacent to residue Phe43 of gp120-bound CD4, has been suggested as a potential target for therapeutic intervention. We designed a CD4 mutant (D1D2F43C) for site-specific coupling of compounds for screening against the cavity. Altogether, 81 cysteine-reactive compounds were designed, synthesized, and tested. Eight derivatives exceeded the affinity of native D1D2 for gp120. Structure-activity relationships (SAR) for derivatized CD4 binding to gp120 revealed significant plasticity of the Phe43 cavity and a narrow entrance. The primary contacts for compound recognition inside the cavity were found to be van der Waals interactions, whereas hydrophilic interactions were detected in the entrance. This first SAR on ligand binding to an interior cavity of gp120 may provide a starting point for structure-based assembly of small molecules targeting gp120-CD4 interaction.",

The procedure has worked without fail on all seven of seven trials on Fabs, which are being used in the crystallization of G-protein coupled receptors. This manner of efficient selection may readily be adapted for the co-production of other complexes of two or more proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-based motor protein complex that plays important roles in a wide range of fundamental cellular processes, including vesicular transport, mitosis, and cell migration. A single major form of cytoplasmic dynein associates with membranous organelles, mitotic kinetochores, the mitotic and migratory cell cortex, centrosomes, and mRNA complexes. The ability of cytoplasmic dynein to recognize such diverse forms of cargo is thought to be associated with its several accessory subunits, which reside at the base of the molecule. The dynein light chains (LCs) LC8 and TcTex1 form a subcomplex with dynein intermediate chains, and they also interact with numerous protein and ribonucleoprotein partners. This observation has led to the hypothesis that these subunits serve to tether cargo to the dynein motor. Here, we present the structure and a thermodynamic analysis of a complex of LC8 and TcTex1 associated with their intermediate chain scaffold. The intermediate chains effectively block the major putative cargo binding sites within the light chains. These data suggest that, in the dynein complex, the LCs do not bind cargo, in apparent disagreement with a role for LCs in dynein cargo binding interactions.",

TF is a three-domain protein that appears to exist in a dynamic equilibrium of oligomerization states and interdomain conformations. X-ray crystallography and chemical cross-linking were used to study the roles of the N- and C-terminal domains of Thermotoga maritima TF in TF oligomerization and chaperone activity. The structural conservation of both the N- and C-terminal TF domains was unambiguously established. The biochemical and crystallographic data reveal a tendency for these domains to partake in diverse and apparently nonspecific protein-protein interactions. It is found that the T. maritima and Escherichia coli TF surfaces lack evident exposed hydrophobic patches. Taken together, these data suggest that TF chaperones could interact with nascent proteins via hydrophilic surfaces.",

We immunized mice with the rat 5HT2c serotonin receptor and derived clonal hybridoma cells, which we tested for specific antigen reactivity by using the complementarity of purified protein from bacteria and receptor-embedded mammalian cell membranes. Nine mAbs met our criteria for specificity, affinity, and sensitivity to conformational features. Epitopes were mapped in various additional tests. Five of the nine mAbs have cytoplasmic epitopes, and two of these are sensitive to the ligand state of the receptor.

FSH signals through a G-protein coupled receptor (FSHR) on the target cell surface. We describe here the strategy to produce a soluble FSH-FSHR complex that involves the co-secretion of a truncated FSHR ectodomain (FSHR(HB)) and a covalently linked FSHalphabeta heterodimer from baculovirus-infected insect cells. FSH binds to FSHR(HB) with a high affinity comparable to that for the full-length receptor. The crystal structure of the FSH-FSHR(HB) complex provides explanations for the high affinity and specificity of FSH interaction with FSHR, and it shows an unexpected dimerization of these complexes. Here we also compare the crystal structure with theoretical models of the FSH-FSHR-binding mode. We conclude that the FSH-FSHR(HB) structure gives an authentic representation of FSH binding to intact FSHR.",

        "Abstract": "A crystallographic study of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) RNase H domain was performed to provide information about its structure and mechanism of action. These efforts resulted in the crystallization of a mutant Mo-MLV RNase H lacking the putative helix C (DeltaC). The 1.6-Angstroms resolution structure resembles the known structures of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Escherichia coli RNase H. The structure revealed the coordination of a magnesium ion within the catalytic core comprised of the highly conserved acidic residues D524, E562, and D583. Surface charge mapping of the Mo-MLV structure revealed a high density of basic charges on one side of the enzyme. Using a model of the Mo-MLV structure superimposed upon a structure of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase bound to an RNA/DNA hybrid substrate, Mo-MLV RNase H secondary structures and individual amino acids were examined for their potential roles in binding substrate. Identified regions included Mo-MLV RNase H beta1-beta2, alphaA, and alphaB and residues from alphaB to alphaD and its following loop. Most of the identified substrate-binding residues corresponded with residues directly binding nucleotides in an RNase H from Bacillus halodurans as observed in a cocrystal structure with RNA/DNA. Finally, superimposition of RNases H of Mo-MLV, E. coli, and HIV-1 revealed that a loop of the HIV-1 connection domain resides within the same region of the Mo-MLV and E. coli C-helix. The HIV-1 connection domain may serve to recognize and bind the RNA/DNA substrate major groove.",

        "Abstract": "It is well established that even small changes in amino acid side chains of antigenic peptide bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein may completely abrogate recognition of the peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex by the T cell receptor (TCR). Often, however, several nonconservative substitutions in the peptide antigen are accommodated and do not impair its recognition by TCR. For example, a preponderance of natural sequence variants of the human immunodeficiency virus p17 Gag-derived peptide SLYNTVATL (SL9) are recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which implies that interactions with SL9 variants are degenerate both with respect to the class I MHC molecule and with respect to TCR. Here we study the molecular basis for this degenerate recognition of SL9 variants. We show that several SL9 variants bind comparably well to soluble HLA-A2 and to a particular soluble TCR and that these variants are active in the cognate cytotoxicity assay. Natural SL9 variation is restricted by its context in the HIV p17 matrix protein. High resolution crystal structures of seven selected SL9 variants bound to HLA-A2 all have remarkably similar peptide conformations and side-chain dispositions outside sites of substitution. This preservation of the peptide conformation despite epitope variations suggests a mechanism for the observed degeneracy in pMHC recognition by TCR and may contribute to the persistence of SL9-mediated immune responses in chronically infected individuals.",

Specific receptor molecules embedded in the plasma membrane detect the different biochemical signals that impact the cell, and these receptors are the conduits for transmission of this information to the cell interior for action. There are several classes of signal transduction receptors and many specific receptors within each of the major classes. This review emphasizes the structural biology of three major classes of transmembrane receptors - tyrosine kinase receptors, histidine kinase sensors, and G-protein coupled receptors. Biophysical principles that govern the processes of signal transduction across cell membranes are also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is a significant human pathogen that causes millions of infections and results in about 24,000 deaths each year. Dendritic cell-specific ICAM3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), abundant in immature dendritic cells, was previously reported as being an ancillary receptor interacting with the surface of DENV. The structure of DENV in complex with the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of DC-SIGN was determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 25 A resolution. One CRD monomer was found to bind to two glycosylation sites at Asn67 of two neighboring glycoproteins in each icosahedral asymmetric unit, leaving the third Asn67 residue vacant. The vacancy at the third Asn67 site is a result of the nonequivalence of the glycoprotein environments, leaving space for the primary receptor binding to domain III of E. The use of carbohydrate moieties for receptor binding sites suggests a mechanism for avoiding immune surveillance.",

        "Abstract": "The large majority of histidine kinases (HKs) are multifunctional enzymes having autokinase, phosphotransfer and phosphatase activities, and most of these are transmembrane sensor proteins. Sensor HKs possess conserved cytoplasmic phosphorylation and ATP-binding kinase domains. The different enzymatic activities require participation by one or both of these domains, implying the need for different conformational states. The catalytic domains are linked to the membrane through a coiled-coil segment that sometimes includes other domains. We describe here the first crystal structure of the complete cytoplasmic region of a sensor HK, one from the thermophile Thermotoga maritima in complex with ADPbetaN at 1.9 A resolution. The structure reveals previously unidentified functions for several conserved residues and reveals the relative disposition of domains in a state seemingly poised for phosphotransfer. The structure thereby inspires hypotheses for the mechanisms of autophosphorylation, phosphotransfer and response-regulator dephosphorylation, and for signal transduction through the coiled-coil segment. Mutational tests support the functional relevance of interdomain contacts.",

        "Abstract": "The unique ligation properties of metal ions are widely exploited by proteins, with approximately one-third of all proteins estimated to be metalloproteins. Although antibodies use various mechanisms for recognition, to our knowledge, none has ever been characterized that uses an interfacial metal. We previously described a family of CD4-reactive antibodies, the archetype being Q425. CD4:Q425 engagement does not interfere with CD4:HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein binding, but it blocks subsequent steps required for viral entry. Here, we use surface-plasmon resonance to show that Q425 requires calcium for recognition of CD4. Specifically, Q425 binding of calcium resulted in a 55,000-fold enhancement in affinity for CD4. X-ray crystallographic analyses of Q425 in the presence of Ca(2+), Ba(2+), or EDTA revealed an exposed metal-binding site, partially coordinated by five atoms contributed from four antibody complementarity-determining regions. The results suggest that Q425 recognition of CD4 involves direct ligation of antigen by the Q425-held calcium, with calcium binding each ligating atom of CD4 with approximately 1.5 kcal/mol of binding energy. This energetic contribution, which is greater than that from a typical protein atom, demonstrates how interfacial metal ligation can play a unique role in antigen recognition.",

        "Abstract": "The binding surface on CD4 for the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein has been transplanted previously onto a scorpion-toxin scaffold. Here, we use X-ray crystallography to characterize atomic-level details of gp120 with this transplant, CD4M33. Despite known envelope flexibility, the conformation of gp120 induced by CD4M33 was so similar to that induced by CD4 that localized measures were required to distinguish ligand-induced differences from lattice variation. To investigate relationships between structure, function, and mimicry, an F23 analog of CD4M33 was devised. Structural and thermodynamic analyses showed F23 to be a better molecular mimic of CD4 than CD4M33. F23 also showed increased neutralization breadth, against diverse isolates of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIVcpz. Our results lend insight into the stability of the CD4 bound conformation of gp120, define measures that quantify molecular mimicry as a function of evolutionary distance, and suggest how such evaluations might be useful in developing mimetic antagonists with increased neutralization breadth.",

        "Title": "Crystal structure of dynein light chain TcTex-1.",
        "Abstract": "TcTex-1, one of three dynein light chains of the dynein motor complex, has been implicated in targeting and binding cargoes to cytoplasmic dynein for retrograde or apical transport. Interactions between TcTex-1 and a diverse set of proteins such as the dynein intermediate chain, Fyn, DOC2, FIP1, the poliovirus receptor, CD155, and the rhodopsin cytoplasmic tail have been reported; yet, despite the broad range of targets, a consensus binding sequence remains uncertain. Consequently, we have solved the crystal structure of the full-length Drosophila homolog of TcTex-1 to 1.7 A resolution using MAD phasing to gain insight into its function and target specificity. The structure is homodimeric with a domain swapping of beta-strand 2 and has a fold similar to the dynein light chain, LC8. Based on structural alignment, the TcTex-1 and LC8 sequences show no identity, although the root mean square deviation between secondary structural elements is less than 1.6 A. Moreover, the N terminus, which is equivalent to beta-strand 1 in LC8, is splayed out and binds to a crystallographic dimer as an anti-parallel beta-strand at the same position as the neuronal nitric-oxide synthase peptide in the LC8 complex. Similarity to LC8 and comparison to the LC8-neuronal nitricoxide synthase complex suggest that TcTex-1 binds its targets in a similar manner as LC8 and provides insight to the lack of strict sequence identity among the targets for TcTex-1.",

        "Abstract": "Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is central to reproduction in mammals. It acts through a G-protein-coupled receptor on the surface of target cells to stimulate testicular and ovarian functions. We present here the 2.9-A-resolution structure of a partially deglycosylated complex of human FSH bound to the extracellular hormone-binding domain of its receptor (FSHR(HB)). The hormone is bound in a hand-clasp fashion to an elongated, curved receptor. The buried interface of the complex is large (2,600 A2) and has a high charge density. Our analysis suggests that all glycoprotein hormones bind to their receptors in this mode and that binding specificity is mediated by key interaction sites involving both the common alpha- and hormone-specific beta-subunits. On binding, FSH undergoes a concerted conformational change that affects protruding loops implicated in receptor activation. The FSH-FSHR(HB) complexes form dimers in the crystal and at high concentrations in solution. Such dimers may participate in transmembrane signal transduction.",

        "Abstract": "Human SCO1 and SCO2 are copper-binding proteins involved in the assembly of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX). We have determined the crystal structure of the conserved, intermembrane space core portion of apo-hSCO1 to 2.8 A. It is similar to redox active proteins, including thioredoxins (Trx) and peroxiredoxins (Prx), with putative copper-binding ligands located at the same positions as the conserved catalytic residues in Trx and Prx. SCO1 does not have disulfide isomerization or peroxidase activity, but both hSCO1 and a sco1 null in yeast show extreme sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. Of the six missense mutations in SCO1 and SCO2 associated with fatal mitochondrial disorders, one lies in a highly conserved exposed surface away from the copper-binding region, suggesting that this region is involved in protein-protein interactions. These data suggests that SCO functions not as a COX copper chaperone, but rather as a mitochondrial redox signaling molecule.",

The Notch intracellular domain translocates to the nucleus after proteolytic release upon Notch extracellular engagement, and there it displaces corepressors from DNA-bound CSL and recruits activators of Notch target genes. Here we report the 2.85 A crystal structure of CSL with a target DNA. CSL comprises three structurally integrated domains: its amino (NTD)- and carboxy (CTD)-terminal domains are strikingly similar to those of Rel transcription factors, but a surprising beta-trefoil domain (BTD) is inserted between them. CSL-bound DNA is recognized specifically by conserved residues from NTD and BTD. A hydrophobic pocket on BTD is identified as the likely site of Notch interaction with CSL, which has functional implications for the mechanism of Notch signaling.",

Many express poorly in bacterial systems, whereas it can be time consuming and expensive to produce them from cells of higher organisms. Here we describe a procedure for the direct selection of stable mammalian cell lines that express proteins of interest in high yield. Coexpression of a marker protein, such as green fluorescent protein, is linked to that of the desired protein through an internal ribosome entry site in the vector that is transfected into cells in culture. The coexpressed marker is used to select for highly expressing clonal cell lines. Applications are described to a membrane protein, the 5HT2c serotonin receptor, and to a secreted cysteine-rich protein, resistin. Besides providing an expeditious means for producing mammalian proteins for structural work, the resulting cell lines also readily support tests of functional properties and structure-inspired hypotheses.",

        "Abstract": "The conserved surface of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein that binds to the HIV-1 coreceptor is protected from humoral recognition by multiple layers of camouflage. Here we present sequence and genomic analyses for 12 antibodies that pierce these defenses and determine the crystal structures of 5. The data reveal mechanisms and atomic-level details for three unusual immune features: posttranslational mimicry of coreceptor by tyrosine sulfation of antibody, an alternative molecular mechanism controlling such sulfation, and highly selective V(H)-gene usage. When confronted by extraordinary viral defenses, the immune system unveils novel adaptive capabilities, with tyrosine sulfation enhancing the vocabulary of antigen recognition.",

        "Abstract": "Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that functions as a chloride channel. Nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1), one of two ABC domains in CFTR, also contains sites for the predominant CF-causing mutation and, potentially, for regulatory phosphorylation. We have determined crystal structures for mouse NBD1 in unliganded, ADP- and ATP-bound states, with and without phosphorylation. This NBD1 differs from typical ABC domains in having added regulatory segments, a foreshortened subdomain interconnection, and an unusual nucleotide conformation. Moreover, isolated NBD1 has undetectable ATPase activity and its structure is essentially the same independent of ligand state. Phe508, which is commonly deleted in CF, is exposed at a putative NBD1-transmembrane interface. Our results are consistent with a CFTR mechanism, whereby channel gating occurs through ATP binding in an NBD1-NBD2 nucleotide sandwich that forms upon displacement of NBD1 regulatory segments.",

        "Abstract": "Human alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T) transfer protein (ATTP) plays a central role in vitamin E homeostasis, preventing degradation of alpha-T by routing this lipophilic molecule for secretion by hepatocytes. Mutations in the gene encoding ATTP have been shown to cause a severe deficiency in alpha-T, which results in a progressive neurodegenerative spinocerebellar ataxia, known as ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED). We have determined the high-resolution crystal structure of human ATTP with (2R,4'R,8'R)-alpha-T in the binding pocket. Surprisingly, the ligand is sequestered deep in the hydrophobic core of the protein, implicating a large structural rearrangement for the entry and release of alpha-T. A comparison to the structure of a related protein, Sec14p, crystallized without a bona fide ligand, shows a possibly relevant open conformation for this family of proteins. Furthermore, of the known mutations that cause AVED, one mutation, L183P, is located directly in the binding pocket. Finally, three mutations associated with AVED involve arginine residues that are grouped together on the surface of ATTP. We propose that this positively charged surface may serve to orient an interacting protein, which might function to regulate the release of alpha-T through an induced change in conformation of ATTP.",

        "Abstract": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120, mediates receptor binding and is the major target for neutralizing antibodies. Primary HIV-1 isolates are characteristically more resistant to broadly neutralizing antibodies, although the structural basis for this resistance remains obscure. Most broadly neutralizing antibodies are directed against functionally conserved gp120 regions involved in binding to either the primary virus receptor, CD4, or the viral coreceptor molecules that normally function as chemokine receptors. These antibodies are known as CD4 binding site (CD4BS) and CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies, respectively. Inspection of the gp120 crystal structure reveals that although the receptor-binding regions lack glycosylation, sugar moieties lie proximal to both receptor-binding sites on gp120 and thus in proximity to both the CD4BS and the CD4i epitopes. In this study, guided by the X-ray crystal structure of gp120, we deleted four N-linked glycosylation sites that flank the receptor-binding regions. We examined the effects of selected changes on the sensitivity of two prototypic HIV-1 primary isolates to neutralization by antibodies. Surprisingly, removal of a single N-linked glycosylation site at the base of the gp120 third variable region (V3 loop) increased the sensitivity of the primary viruses to neutralization by CD4BS antibodies. Envelope glycoprotein oligomers on the cell surface derived from the V3 glycan-deficient virus were better recognized by a CD4BS antibody and a V3 loop antibody than were the wild-type glycoproteins. Absence of all four glycosylation sites rendered a primary isolate sensitive to CD4i antibody-mediated neutralization. Thus, carbohydrates that flank receptor-binding regions on gp120 protect primary HIV-1 isolates from antibody-mediated neutralization.",

This lack of neutralization is paradoxical, given the functional conservation and exposure of receptor-binding sites on the gp120 envelope glycoprotein, which are larger than the typical antibody footprint and should therefore be accessible for antibody binding. Because gp120-receptor interactions involve conformational reorganization, we measured the entropies of binding for 20 gp120-reactive antibodies. Here we show that recognition by receptor-binding-site antibodies induces conformational change. Correlation with neutralization potency and analysis of receptor-antibody thermodynamic cycles suggested a receptor-binding-site 'conformational masking' mechanism of neutralization escape. To understand how such an escape mechanism would be compatible with virus-receptor interactions, we tested a soluble dodecameric receptor molecule and found that it neutralized primary HIV-1 isolates with great potency, showing that simultaneous binding of viral envelope glycoproteins by multiple receptors creates sufficient avidity to compensate for such masking. Because this solution is available for cell-surface receptors but not for most antibodies, conformational masking enables HIV-1 to maintain receptor binding and simultaneously to resist neutralization.",

        "Abstract": "The CD4 molecule plays a key role in the development and activation of helper T cells. Dimerization and oligomerization is often a necessary step in the function of several cell surface receptors. Herein, we provide direct biochemical evidence confirming the presence of CD4 as dimers in transfected cells from hemopoetic and fibroblastic origin as well as in primary T cells. Such dimers are also observed with murine CD4 confirming selective pressure during evolution to maintain such a structure. Using a series of point mutations, we have precisely mapped the dimerization site at residues K318 and Q344 within the fourth extracellular domain of CD4. These residues are highly conserved and their mutation results in interference with dimer formation. More importantly, we demonstrate that dimer formation is essential for the coligand and coreceptor functions of CD4 in T cell activation. These data strongly suggest that CD4 dimerization is necessary for helper T cell function.",

        "Title": "Mutagenic stabilization and/or disruption of a CD4-bound state reveals distinct conformations of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein.",
        "Abstract": "The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein is conformationally flexible. Upon binding to the host cell receptor CD4, gp120 assumes a conformation that is recognized by the second receptor, CCR5 and/or CXCR4, and by the CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies. Guided by the X-ray crystal structure of a gp120-CD4-CD4i antibody complex, we introduced changes into gp120 that were designed to stabilize or disrupt this conformation. One mutant, 375 S/W, in which the tryptophan indole group is predicted to occupy the Phe 43 cavity in the gp120 interior, apparently favors a gp120 conformation closer to that of the CD4-bound state. The 375 S/W mutant was recognized as well as or better than wild-type gp120 by CD4 and CD4i antibodies, and the large decrease in entropy observed when wild-type gp120 bound CD4 was reduced for the 375 S/W mutant. The recognition of the 375 S/W mutant by CD4BS antibodies, which are directed against the CD4-binding region of gp120, was markedly reduced compared with that of the wild-type gp120. Compared with the wild-type virus, viruses with the 375 S/W envelope glycoproteins were resistant to neutralization by IgG1b12, a CD4BS antibody, were slightly more sensitive to soluble CD4 neutralization and were neutralized more efficiently by the 2G12 antibody. Another mutant, 423 I/P, in which the gp120 bridging sheet was disrupted, did not bind CD4, CCR5, or CD4i antibodies, even though recognition by CD4BS antibodies was efficient. These results indicate that CD4BS antibodies recognize conformations of gp120 different from that recognized by CD4 and CD4i antibodies.",

        "Abstract": "Fusion of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to the plasma membrane of target cells is mediated by interaction of its envelope glycoprotein, gp120, with CD4 and appropriate chemokine receptors. gp120 additionally binds to DC-SIGN, a C-type lectin expressed on immature dendritic cells. This interaction does not result in viral fusion, but instead contributes to enhanced infection in trans of target cells that express CD4 and chemokine receptors. Here we show that DC-SIGN mediates rapid internalization of intact HIV into a low pH nonlysosomal compartment. Internalized virus retains competence to infect target cells. Removal of the DC-SIGN cytoplasmic tail reduced viral uptake and abrogated the trans-enhancement of T cell infection. We propose that HIV binds to DC-SIGN to gain access to an intracellular compartment that contributes to augmentation or retention of viral infectivity.",
