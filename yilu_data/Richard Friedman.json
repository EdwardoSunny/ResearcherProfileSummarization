        "Abstract": "This article presents an adaptation of the internal brace ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) repair technique using knotless suture anchors, which shows promise for improved postsurgical functionality and a shortened recovery period in patients with UCL injuries. Traditional methods of UCL reconstruction often require a lengthy 12- to 18-month recovery period, presenting a significant challenge for athletes keen to return to their sport. The modified technique uses smaller sutures and drill holes, thereby eliminating the need for larger anchors and simplifying the surgical process. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive exploration of the rehabilitation protocol involved after surgery, which includes various phases of physical therapy and use of the \"thrower's ten\" program to improve shoulder and elbow stability, strength, and mobility. This technique paves the way for a promising alternative to traditional UCL reconstruction or repair methods, with the potential to significantly enhance clinical outcomes, improve recovery times, and positively impact athletes' lives.",

        "Abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a highly heterogenous autoimmune disease that affects multiple organs, including the heart. The mechanisms by which myocardial injury develops in SLE, however, remain poorly understood. Here we engineered human cardiac tissues and cultured them with IgG fractions containing autoantibodies from SLE patients with and without myocardial involvement. We observed unique binding patterns of IgG from two patient subgroups: (i) patients with severe myocardial inflammation exhibited enhanced binding to apoptotic cells within cardiac tissues subjected to stress, and (ii) patients with systolic dysfunction exhibited enhanced binding to the surfaces of viable cardiomyocytes. Functional assays and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that IgGs from patients with systolic dysfunction exerted direct effects on engineered tissues in the absence of immune cells, altering tissue cellular composition, respiration and calcium handling. Autoantibody target characterization by phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-seq) confirmed distinctive IgG profiles between patient subgroups. By coupling IgG profiling with cell surface protein analyses, we identified four pathogenic autoantibody candidates that may directly alter the function of cells within the myocardium. Taken together, these observations provide insights into the cellular processes of myocardial injury in SLE that have the potential to improve patient risk stratification and inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

        "Abstract": "Improving the management of metastasis in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) is critical, as nearly half of patients with PanNETs present with liver metastases, and this accounts for the majority of patient mortality. We identified angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) as one of the most upregulated angiogenic factors in RNA-Seq data from human PanNET liver metastases and found that higher ANGPT2 expression correlated with poor survival rates. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that ANGPT2 was localized to the endothelial cells of blood vessels in PanNET liver metastases. We observed an association between the upregulation of endothelial ANGPT2 and liver metastatic progression in both patients and transgenic mouse models of PanNETs. In human and mouse PanNET liver metastases, ANGPT2 upregulation coincided with poor T cell infiltration, indicative of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Notably, both pharmacologic inhibition and genetic deletion of ANGPT2 in PanNET mouse models slowed the growth of PanNET liver metastases. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of ANGPT2 promoted T cell infiltration and activation in liver metastases, improving the survival of mice with metastatic PanNETs. These changes were accompanied by reduced plasma leakage and improved vascular integrity in metastases. Together, these findings suggest that ANGPT2 blockade may be an effective strategy for promoting T cell infiltration and immunostimulatory reprogramming to reduce the growth of liver metastases in PanNETs.",

The purpose of this study was to analyze whether IMN or ORIF humeral diaphyseal surgeries result in a significantly higher prevalence of adverse outcomes and whether these outcomes were age dependent.

A preclinical model system that facilitates studies of the TIME and its impact on the responsiveness of human PDAC to immunotherapies remains an unmet need.

Body mass index (BMI) has been used as a risk stratification and counseling tool for patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty in an effort to focus on outcome-driven care. Although the use of BMI cutoffs may have benefits in minimizing complications when selecting patients for total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), it may impact access to care for some patient populations and further increase disparities.

        "Abstract": "An online near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy platform system for real-time powder blending monitoring and blend endpoint determination was tested for a phenytoin sodium formulation. The study utilized robust experimental design and multiple sensors to investigate multivariate data acquisition, model development, and model scale-up from lab to manufacturing. The impact of the selection of various blend endpoint algorithms on predicted blend endpoint (i.e., mixing time) was explored. Spectral data collected at two process scales using two NIR spectrometers was incorporated in a single (global) calibration model. Unique endpoints were obtained with different algorithms based on standard deviation, average, and distributions of concentration prediction for major components of the formulation. Control over phenytoin sodium's distribution was considered critical due to its narrow therapeutic index nature. It was found that algorithms sensitive to deviation from target concentration offered the simplest interpretation and consistent trends. In contrast, algorithms sensitive to global homogeneity of active and excipients yielded the longest mixing time to achieve blending endpoint. However, they were potentially more sensitive to subtle uniformity variations. Qualitative algorithms using principal component analysis (PCA) of spectral data yielded the prediction of shortest mixing time for blending endpoint. The hybrid approach of combining NIR data from different scales presents several advantages. It enables simplifying the chemometrics model building process and reduces the cost of model building compared to the approach of using data solely from commercial scale. Success of such a hybrid approach depends on the spectroscopic variability captured at different scales and their relative contributions in the final NIR model.",

Dosage unit uniformity and dissolution were tested for each lot. All samples met the relevant testing criteria for dosage unit uniformity and dissolution. There were no indications that manufacturer or region impacted a product's acceptability for use by patients. The variability of attributes was used to calculate a process performance index (Ppk) for each facility. Higher Ppk values suggest less variability relative to specification limits. Only two manufacturers fell below a 4-sigma manufacturing benchmark Ppk of 1.33 for dosage unit uniformity: a European manufacturer of a brand drug and an Asian manufacturer of a generic drug. Conversely, all but four manufacturers fell below a 4-sigma benchmark for the minimum Ppk across their product's dissolution timepoints: generic drug manufacturers in India (two), the U.S., and Canada. Compared to the immediate-release products of a previous study, Ppks were generally lower for extended-release products. A retrospective analysis found that manufacturers performing below median Ppks submitted more Field Alert Reports after the end of the sampling period.",

The incidence of revision TSA is increasing because of the increase in primary TSA and the increased utilization of TSA in younger patients.

        "Abstract": "Cancer mortality is primarily a consequence of its metastatic spread. Here, we report that methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA), which can reduce oxidized methionine residues, acts as a suppressor of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) metastasis. MSRA expression is decreased in the metastatic tumors of PDA patients, whereas MSRA loss in primary PDA cells promotes migration and invasion. Chemoproteomic profiling of pancreatic organoids revealed that MSRA loss results in the selective oxidation of a methionine residue (M239) in pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Moreover, M239 oxidation sustains PKM2 in an active tetrameric state to promote respiration, migration, and metastasis, whereas pharmacological activation of PKM2 increases cell migration and metastasis in\u00a0vivo. These results demonstrate that methionine residues can act as reversible redox switches governing distinct signaling outcomes and that the MSRA-PKM2 axis serves as a regulatory nexus between redox biology and cancer metabolism to control tumor metastasis.",

        "Abstract": "The method of surgical incision closure after total shoulder arthroplasty is an important factor to consider, as it affects operating room time, procedure cost, cosmetic outcomes, and patient satisfaction. The optimal method of wound management is unknown, but should be cost-effective, reproducible, and provide a reliable clinical result. This study aimed to compare the following wound closure methods after total shoulder arthroplasty: staples, Dermabond, and Dermabond PRINEO. We hypothesized that wound closure time for Dermabond PRINEO would be faster than Dermabond and comparable to that of staples, and Dermabond PRINEO would be more cost-effective than Dermabond and staples, and provide equal or superior closure outcomes to Dermabond and staples.",

        "Abstract": "A common complication of anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) is aseptic glenoid loosening. Monoblock polyethylene glenoid components with backside ingrowth or on-growth utilize hybrid fixation, with cementation of the peripheral pegs and central ingrowth or on-growth of bone have been designed to decrease glenoid loosening. However, there is a paucity of midterm data comparing cementation of the peripheral peg holes versus all press-fit implantation for hybrid glenoid constructs. The purpose of this study is to compare the minimum five-year clinical and radiographic outcomes of a press-fit hybrid glenoid component with a peripherally cemented hybrid glenoid component in aTSA.",

        "Title": "Loss of the wild-type KRAS allele promotes pancreatic cancer progression through functional activation of YAP1.",
        "Abstract": "Human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) harboring one KRAS mutant allele often displays increasing genomic loss of the remaining wild-type (WT) allele (known as LOH at KRAS) as tumors progress to metastasis, yet the molecular ramification of this WT allelic loss is unknown. In this study, we showed that the restoration of WT KRAS expression in human PDAC cell lines with LOH at KRAS significantly attenuated the malignancy of PDAC cells both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating a tumor-suppressive role of the WT KRAS allele. Through RNA-Seq, we identified the HIPPO signaling pathway to be positively regulated by WT KRAS in PDAC cells. In accordance with this observation, PDAC cells with LOH at KRAS exhibited increased nuclear localization and activation of transcriptional co-activator YAP1. Mechanistically, we discovered that WT KRAS expression sequestered YAP1 from the nucleus, through enhanced 14-3-3zeta interaction with phosphorylated YAP1 at S127. Consistently, expression of a constitutively-active YAP1 mutant in PDAC cells bypassed the growth inhibitory effects of WT KRAS. In patient samples, we found that the YAP1-activation genes were significantly upregulated in tumors with LOH at KRAS, and YAP1 nuclear localization predicted poor survival for PDAC patients. Collectively, our results reveal that the WT allelic loss leads to functional activation of YAP1 and enhanced tumor malignancy, which explains the selection advantage of the tumor cells with LOH at KRAS during pancreatic cancer clonal evolution and progression to metastasis, and should be taken into consideration in future therapeutic strategies targeting KRAS.",

Given its known therapeutic value and low utilization rate, an investigation into the thresholds for TEA institutional volume-outcome relationships is warranted. The purpose of this study was to identify TEA volume thresholds that serve as predictors of institutional outcomes including complications, readmissions, revisions, cost of care, length of stay (LOS), and non-home discharge. We hypothesized that increased institutional volume would be associated with decreased 90-day adverse outcomes and resource utilization.",

        "Abstract": "Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. RAD9 stabilizes the genome, but prostate cancer cells and tumors often have high quantities of the protein. Reduction of RAD9 level within prostate cancer cells decreases tumorigenicity of nude mouse xenographs and metastasis phenotypes in culture, indicating that RAD9 overproduction is essential for the disease. In prostate cancer DU145 cells, CpG hypermethylation in a transcription suppressor site of RAD9 intron 2 causes high-level gene expression. Herein, we demonstrate that DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B are highly abundant in prostate cancer cells DU145, CWR22, LNCaP and PC-3; yet, these DNMTs bind primarily to the transcription suppressor in DU145, the only cells where methylation is critical for RAD9 regulation. For DU145 cells, DNMT1 or DNMT3B shRNA reduced RAD9 level and tumorigenicity, and RAD9 ectopic expression restored this latter activity in the DNMT knockdown cells. High levels of RAD9, DNMT1, DNMT3B and RAD9 transcription suppressor hypermethylation were significantly correlated in prostate tumors, and not in normal prostate tissues. Based on these results, we propose a novel model where RAD9 is regulated epigenetically by DNMT1 and DNMT3B, via targeted hypermethylation, and that consequent RAD9 overproduction promotes prostate tumorigenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Despite advances in lipid-lowering therapies, people with diabetes continue to experience more limited cardiovascular benefits. In diabetes, hyperglycemia sustains inflammation and preempts vascular repair. We tested the hypothesis that the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) contributes to these maladaptive processes. We report that transplantation of aortic arches from diabetic, Western diet-fed Ldlr-/- mice into diabetic Ager-/- (Ager, the gene encoding RAGE) versus WT diabetic recipient mice accelerated regression of atherosclerosis. RNA-sequencing experiments traced RAGE-dependent mechanisms principally to the recipient macrophages and linked RAGE to interferon signaling. Specifically, deletion of Ager in the regressing diabetic plaques downregulated interferon regulatory factor 7 (Irf7) in macrophages. Immunohistochemistry studies colocalized IRF7 and macrophages in both murine and human atherosclerotic plaques. In bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), RAGE ligands upregulated expression of Irf7, and in BMDMs immersed in a cholesterol-rich environment, knockdown of Irf7 triggered a switch from pro- to antiinflammatory gene expression and regulated a host of genes linked to cholesterol efflux and homeostasis. Collectively, this work adds a new dimension to the immunometabolic sphere of perturbations that impair regression of established diabetic atherosclerosis and suggests that targeting RAGE and IRF7 may facilitate vascular repair in diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "Radiotherapy is commonly used to treat a variety of solid human tumors, including localized prostate cancer. However, treatment failure often ensues due to tumor intrinsic or acquired radioresistance. Here we find that the MEK5/ERK5 signaling pathway is associated with resistance to genotoxic stress in aggressive prostate cancer cells. MEK5 knockdown by RNA interference sensitizes prostate cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR) and etoposide treatment, as assessed by clonogenic survival and short-term proliferation assays. Mechanistically, MEK5 downregulation impairs phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK at serine 2056 in response to IR or etoposide treatment. Although MEK5 knockdown does not influence the initial appearance of radiation- and etoposide-induced \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 foci, it markedly delays their resolution, indicating a DNA repair defect. A cell-based assay shows that nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is compromised in cells with ablated MEK5 protein expression. Finally, MEK5 silencing combined with focal irradiation causes strong inhibition of tumor growth in mouse xenografts, compared with MEK5 depletion or radiation alone. These findings reveal a convergence between MEK5 signaling and DNA repair by NHEJ in conferring resistance to genotoxic stress in advanced prostate cancer and suggest targeting MEK5 as an effective therapeutic intervention in the management of this disease.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare patient reported functional outcomes following bilateral aTSA vs rTSA. A retrospective review was conducted on twenty-six pateints who underwent staged bilateral aTSA or rTSA, with a minimum of 2 years follow up. Thirteen patients were included in each group, and patient assessed functional outcomes were measured using the PENN Score, ASES, SST, and SF-12. No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups for all functional outcome scores, patient satisfaction, or SF-12. These findings suggest that patients undergoing bilateral rTSA can expect functional outcomes similar to those obtained after bilateral aTSA.

        "Abstract": "Exquisite regulation of energy homeostasis protects from nutrient deprivation but causes metabolic dysfunction upon nutrient excess. In human and murine adipose tissue, the accumulation of ligands of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) accompanies obesity, implicating this receptor in energy metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that mice bearing global- or adipocyte-specific deletion of Ager, the gene encoding RAGE, display superior metabolic recovery after fasting, a cold challenge, or high-fat feeding. The RAGE-dependent mechanisms were traced to suppression of protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of its key targets, hormone-sensitive lipase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, upon \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimulation-processes that dampen the expression and activity of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and thermogenic programs. This work identifies the innate role of RAGE as a key node in the immunometabolic networks that control responses to nutrient supply and cold challenges, and it unveils opportunities to harness energy expenditure in environmental and metabolic stress.",

        "Abstract": "It is not always clear how to treat glenohumeral osteoarthritis, particularly in young patients. The goals of this study were to 1) quantify how patient age, activity level, symptoms, and radiographic findings impact the decision-making of shoulder specialists and 2) evaluate the observer reliability of the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system for primary osteoarthritis of the shoulder.",

        "Title": "High-resolution genomic alterations in Barrett's metaplasia of patients who progress to esophageal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma.",
        "Abstract": "The main risk factor for esophageal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma (DAC) is Barrett's esophagus (BE), characterized by intestinal metaplasia. The critical genomic mechanisms that lead to progression of nondysplastic BE to DAC remain poorly understood and require analyses of longitudinal patient cohorts and high-resolution assays. We tested BE tissues from 74 patients, including 42 nonprogressors from two separate groups of 21 patients each and 32 progressors (16 in a longitudinal cohort before DAC/preprogression-BE and 16 with temporally concurrent but spatially separate DAC/concurrent-BE). We interrogated genome-wide somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) at the exon level with high-resolution SNP arrays in DNA from formalin-fixed samples histologically confirmed as nondysplastic BE. The most frequent abnormalities were SCNAs involving FHIT exon 5, CDKN2A/B or both in 88% longitudinal BE progressors to DAC vs. 24% in both nonprogressor groups (p = 0.0004). Deletions in other genomic regions were found in 56% of preprogression-BE but only in one nonprogressor-BE (p = 0.0004). SCNAs involving FHIT exon 5 and CDKN2A/B were also frequently detected in BE temporally concurrent with DAC. TP53 losses were detected in concurrent-BE but not earlier in preprogression-BE tissues of patients who developed DAC. CDKN2A/p16 immunohistochemistry showed significant loss of expression in BE of progressors vs. nonprogressors, supporting the genomic data. Our data suggest a role for CDKN2A/B and FHIT in early progression of BE to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma that warrants future mechanistic research. Alterations in CDKN2A/B and FHIT by high-resolution assays may serve as biomarkers of increased risk of progression to DAC when detected in BE tissues.",

        "Abstract": "All-polyethylene tibial (APT) implants were incorporated into the initial design of the first total knee arthroplasty (TKA) systems. Since then, a dynamic shift has taken place and metal-backed tibial (MBT) implants have become the gold standard in TKA. This has mostly been due to the theoretical advantages of intraoperative flexibility and improved biomechanics in addition to the heavy influence of device manufacturers. MBT implant comes not only with a higher cost but also with potential for complications such as osteolysis, backside wear, and thinning of the polyethylene insert, which were not previously seen with APT implant. The majority of studies comparing APT and MBT implants have shown no difference in clinical outcomes and survivorship. Newer studies from the past decade have begun highlighting the economic advantages of APT implant, especially in patients undergoing primary, uncomplicated TKA. Use of APT implants in younger patients and those with a body mass index >\u200935 has not been extensively studied, but the existing literature suggests the use of APT implant in these cohorts to be equally as acceptable. With modern implant design and instrumentation, rising utilization of TKA along with current and future economic strain on health care, the increased use of APT implant could result in massive savings without sacrificing positive patient outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of knee osteoarthritis is increasing, as is the projected use of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to treat severe cases that fail to respond to conservative measures. Implant designs are either cruciate retaining or posterior stabilized, and while both have high success rates, management of the patella still remains a controversial topic. Although studies indicate that resurfacing the patella provides no significant clinical differences compared with non-resurfacing techniques, surgeons continue to resurface the patella during TKA. Rates of patella resurfacing continue to be as high as 90% in the United States, while European countries tend to favor non-resurfacing techniques. The purpose of this article is to discuss relevant research on patella resurfacing during TKA, to compare the results, and give evidence-based recommendations on how it should be approached going forward.",

        "Abstract": "Scapular notching is a common radiographic finding occurring after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, and it refers to an erosive lesion of the inferior scapular neck because of the impingement of the humeral implant during adduction. The clinical importance of notching is unclear, and the optimal treatment of severe notching is unknown. The incidence and severity of scapular notching is related to prosthetic design and surgical technique. Implant design factors include size, shape, and position of the glenosphere, inclination of the humeral neck-shaft angle, implant offset, and native scapular anatomy. Scapular notching may lead to deterioration of functional outcomes and glenoid implant loosening and failure. Lateral offset, inferior glenosphere overhang, and careful consideration of the presurgical glenoid morphology may help prevent scapular notching. Currently, there is limited evidence to direct the management of scapular notching, and further research is needed to elucidate optimal prevention and treatment strategies.",

Experiments employing genetic overexpression or deletion of Ager (the gene encoding RAGE) or its pharmacological antagonism implicate RAGE in the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated nephropathy. We hypothesized that DIAPH1 contributes to pathological and functional derangements in the kidneys of diabetic mice. We show that DIAPH1 is expressed in the human and murine diabetic kidney, at least in part in the tubulointerstitium and glomerular epithelial cells or podocytes. To test the premise that DIAPH1 is linked to diabetes-associated derangements in the kidney, we rendered male mice globally devoid of Diaph1 ( Diaph1",

        "Abstract": "Prostate cancer is a complex disease, with multiple subtypes and clinical presentations. Much progress has been made in recent years to understand the underlying genetic basis that drives prostate cancer. Such mechanistic information is useful for development of novel therapeutic targets, to identify biomarkers for early detection or to distinguish between aggressive and indolent disease, and to predict treatment outcome. Multiple tests have become available in recent years to address these clinical needs for prostate cancer. We describe several of these assays, summarizing test details, performance characteristics, and acknowledging their limitations. There is a pressing unmet need for novel biomarkers that can demonstrate improvement in these areas. We introduce one such candidate biomarker, RAD9, describe its functions in the DNA damage response, and detail why it can potentially fill this void. ",

        "Abstract": "Synovial joints suffer from arthritis and trauma that may be severely debilitative. Despite robust investigations in the roles of individual genes in synovial joint development and arthritis, little is known about global profiles of genes that regulate stem/progenitor cells of a synovial joint. The temporomandibular joint is a poorly understood synovial arthrosis with few clinical treatment options. Here, we isolated the articular and mature zones of the mandibular condyle by laser capture microdissection, performed genome-wide profiling, and analyzed molecular signaling pathways relevant to stem/progenitor cell functions. A total of 804 genes were differentially expressed between the articular and mature zones. Pathway analyses revealed 29 enriched signaling pathways, including the PI3K-Akt, Wnt, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways that may regulate stem/progenitor cell homeostasis and differentiation into the chondrocyte lineage. Upstream regulator analyses further predicted potential upstream key regulators such as Xbp1, Nupr1, and Hif1a, and associated underlying mechanism networks were described. Among the multiple candidates of growth and transcriptional factors that may regulate stem/progenitor cells, we immunolocalized Sox9, Ihh, Frzb, Dkk1, Lgr5, and TGF",

        "Abstract": "Blood loss management is critical to positive outcomes in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Transfusions are associated with an increased risk of major and minor adverse events, length of hospitalization, and overall cost associated with surgery. Many techniques have been investigated and compared. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic drug widely known to reduce blood loss, may be a bridge to the goal of eliminating blood transfusions from TKA. Administration of TXA can be performed intravenously, topically at the knee joint, orally, or in combination. A single bolus or multiple doses have reduced total blood loss and transfusion rates consistently, safely, and cost-effectively. The uptake in use of TXA by surgeons has been slow due to concerns in patients deemed high risk for thromboembolic events. Newer evidence from studies specifically involving high-risk patients demonstrates that TXA is indeed safe in this cohort and provides benefits that greatly outweigh potential risks. Incorporation of TXA as a routine part of TKA is in the best interest of patients, health care teams, and medical institutions. TXA can be employed seamlessly with other blood saving techniques and has the capacity to increase productivity and decrease overall cost. This can be achieved by reducing the incidence of transfusion and length of stay, and the need for practices such as preoperative anemia treatment and suction drainage.",

        "Abstract": "Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) has become increasingly popular since its introduction to the United States. The purpose of this study was to assess the current trends and use of rTSA, anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA), and hemiarthroplasty (HA) from 2011 to 2014. Shoulder arthroplasty data from the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample database were analyzed for the years 2011 to 2014 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes. For each procedure, use and patient and hospital characteristics were identified. Shoulder arthroplasties increased by 24% between 2011 and 2014, to 79,105 procedures. The proportion of arthroplasties that were aTSA did not change substantially (44% for both years; P=.0585), while the proportion that were rTSA surpassed aTSA in 2014, increasing from 33% to 46% (P<.0001). Use of rTSA topped use of aTSA by 2013 for Medicare patients. The proportion that were HA procedures declined from 23% to 11% (P<.0001). The use of rTSA for fracture increased from 26% to 58% (P<.0001) of all arthroplasties for this indication, while the use of HA for fracture decreased from 69% to 40% (P<.0001). Orthopedists performed rTSA more often than aTSA for Medicare patients by 2013 and the general population by 2014. The use of rTSA for fracture has grown significantly, with rTSA being performed more frequently than HA for this indication. [Orthopedics. 2018; 41(3):e416-e423.].",

        "Title": "HMGB1 links chronic liver injury to progenitor responses and hepatocarcinogenesis.",
        "Abstract": "Cell death is a key driver of disease progression and carcinogenesis in chronic liver disease (CLD), highlighted by the well-established clinical correlation between hepatocellular death and risk for the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Moreover, hepatocellular death is sufficient to trigger fibrosis and HCC in mice. However, the pathways through which cell death drives CLD progression remain elusive. Here, we tested the hypothesis that high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) with key roles in acute liver injury, may link cell death to injury responses and hepatocarcinogenesis in CLD. While liver-specific HMGB1 deficiency did not significantly affect chronic injury responses such as fibrosis, regeneration, and inflammation, it inhibited ductular/progenitor cell expansion and hepatocyte metaplasia. HMGB1 promoted ductular expansion independently of active secretion in a nonautonomous fashion, consistent with its role as a DAMP. Liver-specific HMGB1 deficiency reduced HCC development in 3 mouse models of chronic injury but not in a model lacking chronic liver injury. As with CLD, HMGB1 ablation reduced the expression of progenitor and oncofetal markers, a key determinant of HCC aggressiveness, in tumors. In summary, HMGB1 links hepatocyte death to ductular reaction, progenitor signature, and hepatocarcinogenesis in CLD.",

        "Abstract": "Fibrosis and cancer represent two major complications of chronic liver disease. MicroRNAs have been implicated in the development of fibrosis and cancer, thus constituting potential therapeutic targets. Here, we investigated the role of microRNA-21 (miR-21), a microRNA that has been implicated in the development of fibrosis in multiple organs and has also been suggested to act as an \"oncomir.\" Accordingly, miR-21 was the microRNA that showed the strongest up-regulation in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in multiple models of fibrogenesis, with an 8-fold to 24-fold induction compared to quiescent HSCs. However, miR-21 antisense inhibition did not suppress the activation of murine or human HSCs in culture or in liver slices. Moreover, genetic deletion of miR-21 in two independently generated knockout mice or miR-21 antisense inhibition did not alter HSC activation or liver fibrosis in models of toxic and biliary liver injury. Despite a strong up-regulation of miR-21 in injury-associated hepatocellular carcinoma and in cholangiocarcinoma, miR-21 deletion or antisense inhibition did not reduce the development of liver tumors. As inhibition of the most up-regulated microRNA did not affect HSC activation, liver fibrosis, or fibrosis-associated liver cancer, we additionally tested the role of microRNAs in HSCs by HSC-specific Dicer deletion. Although Dicer deletion decreased microRNA expression in HSCs and altered the expression of select genes, it only exerted negligible effects on HSC activation and liver fibrosis.",

        "Title": "MC4R-dependent suppression of appetite by bone-derived lipocalin 2.",
        "Abstract": "Bone has recently emerged as a pleiotropic endocrine organ that secretes at least two hormones, FGF23 and osteocalcin, which regulate kidney function and glucose homeostasis, respectively. These findings have raised the question of whether other bone-derived hormones exist and what their potential functions are. Here we identify, through molecular and genetic analyses in mice, lipocalin 2 (LCN2) as an osteoblast-enriched, secreted protein. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments in mice demonstrate that osteoblast-derived LCN2 maintains glucose homeostasis by inducing insulin secretion and improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. In addition, osteoblast-derived LCN2 inhibits food intake. LCN2 crosses the blood-brain barrier, binds to the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) in the paraventricular and ventromedial neurons of the hypothalamus and activates an MC4R-dependent anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) pathway. These results identify LCN2 as a bone-derived hormone with metabolic regulatory effects, which suppresses appetite in a MC4R-dependent manner, and show that the control of appetite is an endocrine function of bone.",

        "Abstract": "In this issue of Psychodynamic Psychiatry, Michael Stone discusses therapeutic factors in the treatment of patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). He emphasizes the great diversity of borderline patients and points out that a number of manual-based therapies, each described by an acronym, generally achieve positive therapeutic results in the short term. Many borderline patients require years of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and additional treatments, however. Stone observes that patients with this disorder invariably have other personality characteristics and disorders. Suicidality is common among borderline patients, particularly those who also suffer from major depressive episodes. Stone emphasizes the usefulness of a contextual therapeutic model and a flexible clinical stance.",

        "Abstract": "Nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) is a master regulator of inflammation and cell death. Whereas most of the activity of NF-\u03baB is regulated through the inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB) kinase (IKK)-dependent degradation of I\u03baB, IKK also phosphorylates subunits of NF-\u03baB. We investigated the contribution of the phosphorylation of the NF-\u03baB subunit p65 at the IKK phosphorylation site serine 536 (Ser(536)) in humans, which is thought to be required for the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB. Through experiments with knock-in mice (S534A mice) expressing a mutant p65 with an alanine-to-serine substitution at position 534 (the murine homolog of human Ser(536)), we observed increased expression of NF-\u03baB-dependent genes after injection of mice with the inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or exposure to gamma irradiation, and the enhanced gene expression was most pronounced at late time points. Compared to wild-type mice, S534A mice displayed increased mortality after injection with LPS. Increased NF-\u03baB signaling in the S534A mice was at least in part explained by the increased stability of the S534A p65 protein compared to that of the Ser(534)-phosphorylated wild-type protein. Together, our results suggest that Ser(534) phosphorylation of p65 in mice (and, by extension, Ser(536) phosphorylation of human p65) is not required for its nuclear translocation, but instead inhibits NF-\u03baB signaling to prevent deleterious inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is increasing, but factors contributing to malignant progression of its precursor lesion, Barrett's esophagus (BE), have not been defined. Hypergastrinemia caused by long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), has been suggested as one possible risk factor. The gastrin receptor, CCK2R, is expressed in the cardia and upregulated in BE, suggesting the involvement of the gastrin-CCK2R pathway in progression. In the L2-IL-1\u03b2 mouse model, Barrett's-like esophagus arises from the gastric cardia. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the effect of hypergastrinemia on CCK2R+ progenitor cells in L2-IL-1\u03b2 mice.",

        "Abstract": "Circulating levels of undercarboxylated and bioactive osteocalcin double during aerobic exercise at the time levels of insulin decrease. In contrast, circulating levels of osteocalcin plummet early during adulthood in mice, monkeys, and humans of both genders. Exploring these observations revealed that osteocalcin signaling in myofibers is necessary for adaptation to exercise by favoring uptake and catabolism of glucose and fatty acids, the main nutrients of myofibers. Osteocalcin signaling in myofibers also accounts for most of the exercise-induced release of interleukin-6, a myokine that promotes adaptation to exercise in part by driving the generation of bioactive osteocalcin. We further show that\u00a0exogenous osteocalcin is sufficient to enhance the exercise capacity of young mice and to restore to 15-month-old mice the exercise capacity of 3-month-old mice. This study uncovers a bone-to-muscle feedforward endocrine axis that favors adaptation to exercise and can reverse the age-induced decline in exercise capacity.",

Subjects were outpatients treated with drugs and psychotherapy in routine office practice. Differences in sexual behavior between the two groups as a whole were minimal, but meaningful differences emerged when subgroups were compared. Compared to control men, Bipolar men had had more partners in the last year and were more likely to have had sex without condoms. Compared to Bipolar females, Bipolar males had more sex partners, had more sex with strangers, and were more likely to have engaged in homosexual behavior. Even so, some patients in the Comparison group also had engaged in risky sexual behavior. They had failed to use condoms and had had sex with strangers and prostitutes during the previous year.",

        "Abstract": "The existence of adult pancreatic progenitor cells has been debated. While some favor the concept of facultative progenitors involved in homeostasis and repair, neither a location nor markers for such cells have been defined. Using genetic lineage tracing, we show that Doublecortin-like kinase-1 (Dclk1) labels a rare population of long-lived, quiescent pancreatic cells. In vitro, Dclk1+ cells proliferate readily and sustain pancreatic organoid growth. In vivo, Dclk1+ cells are necessary for pancreatic regeneration following injury and chronic inflammation. Accordingly, their loss has detrimental effects after cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Expression of mutant Kras in Dclk1+ cells does not affect their quiescence or longevity. However, experimental pancreatitis converts Kras mutant Dclk1+ cells into potent cancer-initiating cells. As a potential effector of Kras, Dclk1 contributes functionally to the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. Taken together, these observations indicate that Dclk1 marks quiescent pancreatic progenitors that are candidates for the origin of pancreatic cancer.",

The Simpliciti total shoulder system (Wright Medical, formerly Tornier) is a press-fit, porous-coated, canal-sparing humeral implant that relies on metaphyseal fixation only. This prospective, single-arm, multicenter study was performed to evaluate the two-year clinical and radiographic results of the Simpliciti prosthesis in the U.S.",

        "Abstract": "CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) expand in the spleen during cancer and promote progression through suppression of cytotoxic T cells. An anti-inflammatory reflex arc involving the vagus nerve and memory T cells is necessary for resolution of acute inflammation. Failure of this neural circuit could promote procarcinogenic inflammation and altered tumour immunity. Here we show that splenic TFF2, a secreted anti-inflammatory peptide, is released by vagally modulated memory T cells to suppress the expansion of MDSCs through CXCR4. Splenic denervation interrupts the anti-inflammatory neural arc, resulting in the expansion of MDSCs and colorectal cancer. Deletion of Tff2 recapitulates splenic denervation to promote carcinogenesis. Colorectal carcinogenesis could be suppressed through transgenic overexpression of TFF2, adenoviral transfer of TFF2 or transplantation of TFF2-expressing bone marrow. TFF2 is important to the anti-inflammatory reflex arc and plays an essential role in arresting MDSC proliferation. TFF2 offers a potential approach to prevent and to treat cancer.",

        "Abstract": "The regulation and stem cell origin of normal and neoplastic gastric glands are uncertain. Here, we show that Mist1 expression marks quiescent stem cells in the gastric corpus isthmus. Mist1(+) stem cells serve as a cell-of-origin for intestinal-type cancer with the combination of Kras and Apc mutation and for diffuse-type cancer with the loss of E-cadherin. Diffuse-type cancer development is dependent on inflammation mediated by Cxcl12(+) endothelial cells and Cxcr4(+) gastric innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). These cells form the perivascular gastric stem cell niche, and Wnt5a produced from ILCs activates RhoA to inhibit anoikis in the E-cadherin-depleted cells. Targeting Cxcr4, ILCs, or Wnt5a inhibits diffuse-type gastric carcinogenesis, providing targets within the neoplastic gastric stem cell niche.",

        "Abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of the green tea-derived Polyphenon E (Poly E) in patients with Barrett's Esophagus (BE). Subjects were randomized to a 6-month, twice daily (BID) oral treatment of placebo or Poly E (200, 400, or 600 mg). Endoscopic evaluation, including biopsies, was performed before and after treatment. The primary objective was to demonstrate safety; secondary objectives investigated catechin accumulation and effects in clinical specimens. Of the 44 enrolled subjects, 11 received placebo, and 33 received Poly E. No dose-limiting toxicities were encountered, and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. The recommended phase II dose was 600 mg twice daily. The most common treatment-related adverse events (AE) in Poly E-treated subjects were grade I and II nausea, grade I belching, and grade I lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevation. No treatment-related AEs were reported in placebo-treated subjects, aside from grade I laboratory abnormalities. Pill counts and subject diaries were not consistently collected, and compliance was difficult to determine. However, on the basis of an intention-to-treat analysis, there was a significant relationship between Poly E dose and esophageal EGCG level--mean changes (pmol/g) of 0.79 (placebo), 6.06 (200 mg), 35.67 (400 mg), and 34.95 (600 mg); P = 0.005. There was a possible relationship between Poly E dose and urine PGE-M concentration. In conclusion, Poly E was well-tolerated, and treatment with Poly E (400 and 600 mg) but not Poly E (200 mg) or placebo resulted in clinically relevant and detectable EGCG accumulation in the target organ, esophageal mucosa.",

        "Title": "RAGE Suppresses ABCG1-Mediated Macrophage Cholesterol Efflux in Diabetes.",
        "Abstract": "Diabetes exacerbates cardiovascular disease, at least in part through suppression of macrophage cholesterol efflux and levels of the cholesterol transporters ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is highly expressed in human and murine diabetic atherosclerotic plaques, particularly in macrophages. We tested the hypothesis that RAGE suppresses macrophage cholesterol efflux and probed the mechanisms by which RAGE downregulates ABCA1 and ABCG1. Macrophage cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A1 and HDL and reverse cholesterol transport to plasma, liver, and feces were reduced in diabetic macrophages through RAGE. In vitro, RAGE ligands suppressed ABCG1 and ABCA1 promoter luciferase activity and transcription of ABCG1 and ABCA1 through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPARG)-responsive promoter elements but not through liver X receptor elements. Plasma levels of HDL were reduced in diabetic mice in a RAGE-dependent manner. Laser capture microdissected CD68(+) macrophages from atherosclerotic plaques of Ldlr(-/-) mice devoid of Ager (RAGE) displayed higher levels of Abca1, Abcg1, and Pparg mRNA transcripts versus Ager-expressing Ldlr(-/-) mice independently of glycemia or plasma levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides.

Traditionally, this has been accomplished with medications, such as low-molecular-weight heparin and warfarin. However, these traditional anticoagulants possess a variety of shortcomings that leave much room for improvement. A new class of oral anticoagulants is now available, and present a more convenient option for safe and efficacious thromboprophylaxis in post arthroplasty patients, particularly in the outpatient setting. This review focuses on the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, and the selective factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, and the clinical data to date about their use in total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty patients.",

        "Abstract": "Preparticipation screening for unsuspected cardiovascular disease is a controversial topic in the medical and lay communities. Much attention has been directed towards young competitive athletes, particularly the proposed strategy of incorporating 12-lead electrocardiograms into the screening process, even on a national or worldwide basis. However, sudden deaths of young athletes owing to genetic or congenital heart diseases have a low incidence in the general population. Furthermore, young people not engaged in competitive sports can harbour the same conditions that cause sudden death in athletes, which has gone largely unrecognized. Notably, sudden deaths from these diseases are numerically far more common in the much larger population of nonathletes. In this Perspectives article, we propose that an ethical dilemma has emerged, raising the important public-health issue of whether young individuals should be arbitrarily excluded from potentially life-saving clinical screening evaluations because they do not engage in competitive sports programmes.",

        "Abstract": "The stem cells that maintain and repair the postnatal skeleton remain undefined. One model suggests that perisinusoidal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) give rise to osteoblasts, chondrocytes, marrow stromal cells, and adipocytes, although the existence of these cells has not been proven through fate-mapping experiments. We demonstrate here that expression of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist gremlin 1 defines a population of osteochondroreticular (OCR) stem cells in the bone marrow. OCR stem cells self-renew and generate osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and reticular marrow stromal cells, but not adipocytes. OCR stem cells are concentrated within the metaphysis of long bones not in the perisinusoidal space and are needed for bone development, bone remodeling, and fracture repair. Grem1 expression also identifies intestinal reticular stem cells (iRSCs) that are cells of origin for the periepithelial intestinal mesenchymal sheath. Grem1 expression identifies distinct connective tissue stem cells in both the bone (OCR stem cells) and the intestine (iRSCs).",

        "Abstract": "The nervous system plays an important role in the regulation of epithelial homeostasis and has also been postulated to play a role in tumorigenesis. We provide evidence that proper innervation is critical at all stages of gastric tumorigenesis. In three separate mouse models of gastric cancer, surgical or pharmacological denervation of the stomach (bilateral or unilateral truncal vagotomy, or local injection of botulinum toxin type A) markedly reduced tumor incidence and progression, but only in the denervated portion of the stomach. Vagotomy or botulinum toxin type A treatment also enhanced the therapeutic effects of systemic chemotherapy and prolonged survival. Denervation-induced suppression of tumorigenesis was associated with inhibition of Wnt signaling and suppression of stem cell expansion. In gastric organoid cultures, neurons stimulated growth in a Wnt-mediated fashion through cholinergic signaling. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockout of the muscarinic acetylcholine M3 receptor suppressed gastric tumorigenesis. In gastric cancer patients, tumor stage correlated with neural density and activated Wnt signaling, whereas vagotomy reduced the risk of gastric cancer. Together, our findings suggest that vagal innervation contributes to gastric tumorigenesis via M3 receptor-mediated Wnt signaling in the stem cells, and that denervation might represent a feasible strategy for the control of gastric cancer.",

Published GWAS studies established a correlation between genetic polymorphisms of the \u03b12\u03b21 integrin gene and incidence of diabetic retinopathy. Recent studies indicated that \u03b12-null mice demonstrate superior vascularization in both the wound and diabetic microenvironments. The goal of this study was to determine whether the vasculoprotective effects of \u03b12-integrin deficiency extended to the retina, using the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).",

When prescribing anticoagulant prophylaxis, clinicians weigh the benefits of thromboprophylaxis against bleeding risk and other adverse events. Previous benefit-risk analyses of the REgulation of Coagulation in ORthopaedic surgery to prevent Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (RECORD) randomized clinical studies of rivaroxaban versus enoxaparin after total hip (THA) or knee (TKA) arthroplasty generally used pooled THA and TKA results, counted fatal bleeding as both an efficacy and a safety event, and included the active and placebo-controlled portions of RECORD2, which might confound benefit-risk assessments. We conducted a post hoc analysis without these constraints to assess benefit-risk for rivaroxaban versus enoxaparin in the RECORD studies.",

        "Abstract": "In vitro studies have demonstrated a critical role for high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in autophagy and the autophagic clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria, resulting in severe mitochondrial fragmentation and profound disturbances of mitochondrial respiration in HMGB1-deficient cells. Here, we investigated the effects of HMGB1 deficiency on autophagy and mitochondrial function in vivo, using conditional Hmgb1 ablation in the liver and heart. Unexpectedly, deletion of Hmgb1 in hepatocytes or cardiomyocytes, two cell types with abundant mitochondria, did not alter mitochondrial structure or function, organ function, or long-term survival. Moreover, hepatic autophagy and mitophagy occurred normally in the absence of Hmgb1, and absence of Hmgb1 did not significantly affect baseline and glucocorticoid-induced hepatic gene expression. Collectively, our findings suggest that HMGB1 is dispensable for autophagy, mitochondrial quality control, the regulation of gene expression, and organ function in the adult organism.",

        "Abstract": "In mammals, changes in the metabolic state, including obesity, fasting, cold challenge, and high-fat diets (HFDs), activate complex immune responses. In many strains of rodents, HFDs induce a rapid systemic inflammatory response and lead to obesity. Little is known about the molecular signals required for HFD-induced phenotypes. We studied the function of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in the development of phenotypes associated with high-fat feeding in mice. RAGE is highly expressed on immune cells, including macrophages. We found that high-fat feeding induced expression of RAGE ligand HMGB1 and carboxymethyllysine-advanced glycation end product epitopes in liver and adipose tissue. Genetic deficiency of RAGE prevented the effects of HFD on energy expenditure, weight gain, adipose tissue inflammation, and insulin resistance. RAGE deficiency had no effect on genetic forms of obesity caused by impaired melanocortin signaling. Hematopoietic deficiency of RAGE or treatment with soluble RAGE partially protected against peripheral HFD-induced inflammation and weight gain. These findings demonstrate that high-fat feeding induces peripheral inflammation and weight gain in a RAGE-dependent manner, providing a foothold in the pathways that regulate diet-induced obesity and offering the potential for therapeutic intervention.",

        "Abstract": "Cells of the osteoblast lineage affect the homing and the number of long-term repopulating haematopoietic stem cells, haematopoietic stem cell mobilization and lineage determination and B cell lymphopoiesis. Osteoblasts were recently implicated in pre-leukaemic conditions in mice. However, a single genetic change in osteoblasts that can induce leukaemogenesis has not been shown. Here we show that an activating mutation of \u03b2-catenin in mouse osteoblasts alters the differentiation potential of myeloid and lymphoid progenitors leading to development of acute myeloid leukaemia with common chromosomal aberrations and cell autonomous progression. Activated \u03b2-catenin stimulates expression of the Notch ligand jagged 1 in osteoblasts. Subsequent activation of Notch signalling in haematopoietic stem cell progenitors induces the malignant changes. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Notch signalling ameliorates acute myeloid leukaemia and demonstrates the pathogenic role of the Notch pathway. In 38% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukaemia, increased \u03b2-catenin signalling and nuclear accumulation was identified in osteoblasts and these patients showed increased Notch signalling in haematopoietic cells. These findings demonstrate that genetic alterations in osteoblasts can induce acute myeloid leukaemia, identify molecular signals leading to this transformation and suggest a potential novel pharmacotherapeutic approach to acute myeloid leukaemia.",

        "Abstract": "Freud (1905/1953) anchored his theories of unconscious psychological functioning in observations and inferences about childhood sexuality. These ideas remain influential among psychoanalysts today. Much progress subsequently occurred in extra-psychoanalytic research in human sexuality. This included the discovery in 1959 of an entirely new area of psychology: the sexual differentiation of behavior (Phoenix, Goy, Gerall, & Young, 1959; Wallen, 2009). The observations that led to this new field originally concerned the effects of androgen administered prenatally to non-human animals. This early research was compatible with later studies of humans as well. Prenatal androgen influences both erotic and non-erotic behavior, including childhood rough-and-tumble play (RTP). We have previously emphasized the need to integrate this psychoneuroendocrine knowledge with psychoanalytic theory and practice (Friedman, 1988; Friedman & Downey, 2002, 2008a, 2008b). In this article, we discuss additional aspects of the relationship between sexually differentiated childhood play, particularly RTP, and gender differences in psychosexual development and functioning. These topics and other aspects of the sexual differentiation of behavior have been under-emphasized in psychoanalytic thought.",

        "Title": "Is increased sexual behavior a symptom of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents?",
        "Abstract": "While there is consensus that bipolar disorder exists in children and adolescents, its diagnostic criteria are debated. Excessive sexual behavior has been reported in youth who may have juvenile bipolar disorder (JBD), and has been termed \"hypersexuality.\" Although there is no universal definition of this term, this observation has led to a hypothesis that increased sexual behavior characterizes the bipolar syndrome in children and adolescents, and differentiates it from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Although this hypothesis is plausible, evidence for it is incomplete, because testing it definitively would require both establishing a standard definition of hypersexuality in children and adolescents, and also reaching consensus about the other nonsexual criteria for pediatric bipolar disorder. In addition, studies to test it would need to control factors other than JBD that are known to increase sexual behavior in children and adolescents. These include sexual abuse and related posttraumatic stress disorder, excessive exposure to sexual stimuli, psychiatric illness in general, and social variables such as family chaos and social stress. Some of these factors might increase sexual behavior in youth with bipolar disorder through psychodynamic mechanisms rather than as a result of the illness itself. Therefore, further research is needed to determine whether increased sexual behavior can serve as a diagnostically valuable criterion for bipolar disorder in children and adolescents, and whether it differentiates the disorder from other conditions known to be associated with increased sexual behavior in youth.",

        "Title": "The DNA damage checkpoint protein RAD9A is essential for male meiosis in the mouse.",
        "Abstract": "In mitotic cells, RAD9A functions in repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination and facilitates the process by cell cycle checkpoint control in response to DNA damage. DSBs occur naturally in the germline during meiosis but whether RAD9A participates in repairing such breaks is not known. In this study, we determined that RAD9A is indeed expressed in the male germ line with a peak of expression in late pachytene and diplotene stages, and the protein was found associated with the XY body. As complete loss of RAD9A is embryonic lethal, we constructed and characterized a mouse strain with Stra8-Cre driven germ cell-specific ablation of Rad9a beginning in undifferentiated spermatogonia in order to assess its role in spermatogenesis. Adult mutant male mice were infertile or sub-fertile due to massive loss of spermatogenic cells. The onset of this loss occurs during meiotic prophase, and there was an increase in the numbers of apoptotic spermatocytes as determined by TUNEL. Spermatocytes lacking RAD9A usually arrested in meiotic prophase, specifically in pachytene. The incidence of unrepaired DNA breaks increased, as detected by accumulation of \u03b3H2AX and DMC1 foci on the axes of autosomal chromosomes in pachytene spermatocytes. The DNA topoisomerase II\u03b2-binding protein 1 (TOPBP1) was still localized to the sex body, albeit with lower intensity, suggesting that RAD9A may be dispensable for sex body formation. We therefore show for the first time that RAD9A is essential for male fertility and for repair of DNA DSBs during meiotic prophase I.",

        "Abstract": "Although it is well established that hepatic macrophages play a crucial role in the development of liver fibrosis, the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Moreover, it is not known whether other mononuclear phagocytes such as dendritic cells (DCs) contribute to hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and liver fibrosis. We show for the first time that hepatic macrophages enhance myofibroblast survival in a nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB)-dependent manner and thereby promote liver fibrosis. Microarray and pathway analysis revealed no induction of HSC activation pathways by hepatic macrophages but a profound activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway in HSCs. Conversely, depletion of mononuclear phagocytes during fibrogenesis in vivo resulted in suppressed NF-\u03baB activation in HSCs. Macrophage-induced activation of NF-\u03baB in HSCs in vitro and in vivo was mediated by interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Notably, IL-1 and TNF did not promote HSC activation but promoted survival of activated HSCs in vitro and in vivo and thereby increased liver fibrosis, as demonstrated by neutralization in coculture experiments and genetic ablation of IL-1 and TNF receptor in vivo. Coculture and in vivo ablation experiments revealed only a minor contribution to NF-\u03baB activation in HSCs by DCs, and no contribution of DCs to liver fibrosis development, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD), particularly when it affects a child or a young athlete who is presumed to be healthy, is an emotionally charged event that has a widespread impact. An effective ECG screening strategy for this population is intuitively appealing. The primary objective of ECG screening is to detect occult cardiovascular conditions likely to manifest with SCD. Such an endeavor is only effective if it is highly sensitive with an acceptably low false-positive rate. It also must be accompanied by an intervention that reduces the risk of SCD and improves outcomes. Despite significant advancements, considerable knowledge gaps remain about the etiology of SCD and the frequency with which SCD occurs. Reports of screening programs that have reduced the incidence of SCD have limited generalizability based on program design and the populations studied. Within the USA, considerable gaps in knowledge exist related to the frequency of SCD in youth and to the incremental predictive value of an ECG when added to a standardized history and physical examination. The strategy of ECG screening of young populations needs careful consideration based on principles of effective screening and evidence-based medicine. From a health policy perspective, additional data are needed from robust registries and carefully designed trials before advancing ECG screening in youth.",

        "Abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-8 has an important role in initiating inflammation in humans, attracting immune cells such as neutrophils through their receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. IL-8 has been proposed to contribute to chronic inflammation and cancer. However, mice do not have the IL-8 gene, so human cancer cell lines and xenograft studies have been used to study the role of IL-8 in colon and gastric carcinogenesis. We generated mice that carry a bacterial artificial chromosome that encompasses the entire human IL-8 gene, including its regulatory elements (IL-8Tg mice).",

        "Title": "Toward a definition of \"hypersexuality\" in children and adolescents.",
        "Abstract": "Recent psychiatric literature has used the term \"hypersexuality\" to denote pathologically increased sexual behavior in children and adolescents. Various patterns of increased sexuality have been described in youth, including sexuality that is excessive, developmentally precocious, compulsive, aggressive, or otherwise socially inappropriate. Such \"hypersexual\" behavior in children and adolescents is associated with a variety of factors. Social factors include sexual abuse, physical abuse, life stress, and impaired family relationships. Psychiatric factors include emotional and behavioral problems in general, posttraumatic stress disorder and dissociative symptoms in particular, and possibly bipolar disorder. Despite the importance of increased sexual behavior in youth as a possible sign of these problems, there is currently no uniform definition in psychiatric literature of the term \"hypersexuality\" applied to children and adolescents. The usefulness of this term depends upon the degree to which it can be defined, measured, and distinguished from non-pathological juvenile sexual behavior. Research instruments are described that may be useful in measuring levels of sexual behavior in children and adolescents. Elements of a definition of juvenile hypersexuality are proposed based upon current knowledge about children and adolescents' sexuality in both normal development and a variety of conditions in which it is increased. Care is warranted in distinguishing between normal and abnormal sexual behavior in youth because of the variety of factors that can affect its measurement.",

Furthermore, suggestions that peripheral nerve block may reduce adverse effects have recently been put forward. Although older studies showed a reduction in venous thromboembolism (VTE) with neuraxial compared with general anaesthesia, this difference has not been confirmed in studies using effective current thromboprophylaxis. We used a large data set to investigate the pattern of anaesthesia usage, and whether anaesthesia type affects efficacy and bleeding outcomes of thromboprophylaxis overall, within each treatment group, or for the novel oral anticoagulant dabigatran etexilate versus enoxaparin.",

        "Title": "Dabigatran etexilate and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetylsalicylic acid in patients undergoing total hip and total knee arthroplasty: no increased risk of bleeding.",
        "Abstract": "Patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty should receive anticoagulant therapy because of the high risk of venous thromboembolism. However, many are already taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) that can have antihaemostatic effects. We assessed the bleeding risk in patients treated with thromboprophylactic dabigatran etexilate, with and without concomitant NSAID or ASA. A post-hoc analysis was undertaken of the pooled data from trials comparing dabigatran etexilate (220 mg and 150 mg once daily) and enoxaparin. Major bleeding event (MBE) rates were determined and odds ratios (ORs) generated for patients who received study treatment plus NSAID (half-life \u226412 hours) or ASA (\u2264160 mg/day) versus study treatment alone. Relative risks were calculated for comparisons between treatments. Overall, 4,405/8,135 patients (54.1%) received concomitant NSAID and 386/8,135 (4.7%) received ASA.ORs for the comparison with/without concomitant NSAID were 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-2.01) for 220 mg dabigatran etexilate; 1.19 (0.55-2.55) for 150 mg; and 1.32 (0.67-2.57) for enoxaparin. ORs for the comparison with/without ASA were 1.14 (0.26-5.03); 1.64 (0.36-7.49); and 2.57 (0.83-7.94), respectively. For both NSAIDs and ASA there was no significant difference in bleeding between patients with and without concomitant therapy in any treatment arm. Patients concomitantly taking NSAIDs or ASA have a similar risk of MBE to those taking dabigatran etexilate alone. No significant differences in MBE were detected between dabigatran etexilate and enoxaparin within co-medication subgroups, suggesting that no increased major bleeding risk exists when dabigatran etexilate is administered with NSAID or ASA.",

        "Abstract": "Increased translocation of intestinal bacteria is a hallmark of chronic liver disease and contributes to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Here we tested the hypothesis that the intestinal microbiota and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) promote hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a long-term consequence of chronic liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Hepatocarcinogenesis in chronically injured livers depended on the intestinal microbiota and TLR4 activation in non-bone-marrow-derived resident liver cells. TLR4 and the intestinal microbiota were not required for HCC initiation but for HCC promotion, mediating increased proliferation, expression of the hepatomitogen epiregulin, and prevention of apoptosis. Gut sterilization restricted to late stages of hepatocarcinogenesis reduced HCC, suggesting that the intestinal microbiota and TLR4 represent therapeutic targets for HCC prevention in advanced liver disease.",

B. cepacia is comprised of closely related species called Burkholderia cepacia complex, which has contaminated many finished pharmaceutical products and environments used to manufacture pharmaceuticals. This review includes a brief perspective as described in several U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents, and assesses root cause using product recall reports and FDA Establishment Inspection Reports. We identify several possible points of origin for microbial contamination. This discussion also includes concern with anomalies in test methods that may influence B. cepacia measurement. The issue of objectionable microorganisms and whether B. cepacia can readily be included in a compendial chapter is briefly discussed. Finally, this paper underscores that drugs contaminated with B. cepacia pose a serious threat to susceptible patients, particularly those with cystic fibrosis or who are otherwise immunocompromised. It is therefore important to prevent B. cepacia from contaminating pharmaceutical manufacturing environments, raw materials, and finished products.",

        "Abstract": "Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) arises from Barrett esophagus (BE), intestinal-like columnar metaplasia linked to reflux esophagitis. In a transgenic mouse model of BE, esophageal overexpression of interleukin-1\u03b2 phenocopies human pathology with evolution of esophagitis, Barrett-like metaplasia and EAC. Histopathology and gene signatures closely resembled human BE, with upregulation of TFF2, Bmp4, Cdx2, Notch1, and IL-6. The development of BE and EAC was accelerated by exposure to bile acids and/or nitrosamines, and inhibited by IL-6 deficiency. Lgr5(+) gastric cardia stem cells present in BE were able to lineage trace the early BE lesion. Our data suggest that BE and EAC arise from gastric progenitors due to a tumor-promoting IL-1\u03b2-IL-6 signaling cascade and Dll1-dependent Notch signaling.",

        "Abstract": "We have measured the dose dependence of the degree of amorphization of titanite, CaTiSiO(5). Titanite is an often metamict mineral which has been considered as a matrix for the encapsulation of radiogenic waste, such as Pu. The amorphous fraction p of geologically irradiated samples (ages between 0.3 and 1 Ga) follows p = 1 - exp(-B(a)D) where D is the total dose and the characteristic amorphization mass is B(a) = 2.7(3) \u00d7 10(-19) g. Amorphization follows the direct impact mechanism where each \u03b1-decay leads to a recoil of the radiogenic atoms (mostly Th and U), which then, in turn, displaces some 5000 atoms of the titanite matrix. The amorphization behaviour is almost identical with that of zircon, ZrSiO(4), which has a similar molecular mass. While the recrystallization mechanism and elastic behaviour of the two minerals are very different, we do not find significant differences for the amorphization mechanism. Our samples have undergone little reheating over their geological history, since heating over 800 K would lead to rapid recrystallization for which we have found no evidence.",

        "Title": "Opposing roles of RAGE and Myd88 signaling in extensive liver resection.",
        "Abstract": "In extensive liver resection secondary to primary or metastatic liver tumors, or in living donor liver transplantation, strategies to quell deleterious inflammatory responses and facilitate regeneration are essential. The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and myeloid differentiating factor 88 (Myd88) are implicated in the inflammatory response. To establish the contributions of RAGE vs. Myd88 signaling in extensive liver resection, we probed the effect of RAGE and/or Myd88, the latter primarily a key transducer of major toll-like receptors and also implicated in interleukin-1 (Il1) signaling, in a murine model of extensive (85%) hepatectomy. We report that, although Myd88 is thoroughly essential for survival via regulation of NF-\u03baB and TNF-\u03b1, deletion of RAGE significantly improved survival compared to wild-type, Myd88-null, or RAGE-null/Myd88-null mice. RAGE opposes Myd88 signaling at multiple levels: by suppression of p65 levels, thereby reducing activation of NF-\u03baB and consequent production of cyclin D1, and by suppression of Il6-mediated phosphorylation of Stat3, thereby down-regulating Pim1 and suppressing the hyperplastic response. Further, RAGE-dependent suppression of glyoxalase1, a detoxification pathway for pre-AGEs, enhances AGE levels and suppresses Il6 action. We conclude that blockade of RAGE may rescue liver remnants from the multiple signals that preclude adaptive proliferation triggered primarily by Myd88 signaling pathways.",

        "Abstract": "A survey was mailed to a representative sample of US orthopedic surgeons to assess protocols for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after lower extremity total joint arthroplasty. Practices were examined by type of operation, annual surgical volume, and opinions of consensus guidelines issued by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American College of Chest Physicians. Although there was near-unanimous agreement that routine thromboprophylaxis should be the standard practice for patients who undergo hip or knee arthroplasty, surgeons were divided as to the exact management approach.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical investigations have suggested that repression of the TGF-\u03b2 type II receptor (T\u03b2RII) may be an important step in progression of lung adenocarcinoma from an indolent in situ state to a frank invasive carcinoma. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of deleting the murine homolog of this receptor (Tgfbr2) in a mouse model of mutant K-ras-induced lung carcinoma, which normally induces the formation of multifocal tumors of low invasive potential. In this model, loss of Tgfbr2 induced a highly invasive phenotype associated with lymph node metastasis and reduced survival. Tumor-associated stromal cells displayed an immunosuppressive profile marked by increased numbers of B and T cells. Moreover, tumor stromal cell profiling revealed a developmental TGF-\u03b2 response profile that associated with a collagenized extracellular matrix and increased invasion of TGF-\u03b2 nonresponsive tumor cells. Together, these results suggest that our KrasTgfbr2(-/-) mouse model of invasive lung carcinoma mirrors the genomic response and clinical progression of human lung adenocarcinoma, recapitulating changes in lung stromal pathways that occur in the tumor microenvironment during malignant progression in this disease.",

        "Title": "Electrophysiology issues in adult congenital heart disease.",
        "Abstract": "Improved surgical outcomes in children have led to a growing population of adults with congenital heart disease. Rhythm disturbances in the adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patient can be intrinsic to the anomaly or acquired after palliation. Tachyarrhythmias, either supraventricular or ventricular, and bradyarrhythmias, either sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular block, may occur frequently. Technological advances in intervention and surgical approaches have led to prophylactic and therapeutic reduction in arrhythmias. In order of escalation, this article addresses medical management, catheter ablation, device therapy for antitachycardia pacing and defibrillation, and surgical intervention. There are now an estimated one million-plus ACHD patients living in the United States. An estimated 45% of those have simple defects (e.g., atrial septal defects), 40% have moderately complex defects (e.g., tetralogy of Fallot, or ToF), and 15% have severely complex defects (e.g., single ventricle anatomy or surgical palliations for transposition of the great arteries [TGA]). The moderate and severe categories have a high incidence of arrhythmia. Of older repaired ToF patients, 34% develop symptomatic atrial or supraventricular tachycardias, 8.5% develop high-grade ventricular tachycardia (VT), and there are an increasing number of implantable defibrillators due to a sudden-death estimate of 2% per decade. Thus, an estimated 50,000 adults with repaired ToF will require electrophysiology follow-up with 100 sudden deaths per year nationally. Roughly 3% of all congenital heart surgeries requiring cardiopulmonary bypass have post-operative AV block, and 1% will require permanent pacing. Older atriopulmonary Fontans have up to an estimated 50% incidence of atrial tachycardia within a decade of palliation due to suture lines and elevated atrial pressures. Patients who have undergone an atrial switch operation (e.g., Mustard or Senning operations) are rarely exclusively in sinus rhythm a decade after repair, thus posing problems for rhythm control and anticoagulation. Catheter ablation in congenital heart disease is often more challenging than structurally normal hearts because of abnormal anatomy (congenital and/or post-surgical) and thicker chamber walls due to unfavorable hemodynamics. In preparation, review of noninvasive imaging, previous catheterization angiography, and surgical palliation reports are paramount prior to a procedure. Fortunately, to meet the growing challenge, newer software with 3-D packages allow for improved mapping. In addition, advances with larger-tipped and irrigated-tip catheters allow for deeper, more effective lesions to be placed. Several advances in surgical approach have led to a reduction in arrhythmias. For example, the arterial switch operation for d-transposition of the great arteries instead of the aforementioned atrial switch operation eliminates the use of a systemic right ventricle that can later develop intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia and sinus node dysfunction. Other advances include paying careful attention to minimizing ventriculotomies in ToF and ventricular septal defect (VSD) repairs, earlier complete repairs, and valve sparing to reduce pulmonary insufficiency. Finally, completion of the extra-cardiac Fontan procedure (e.g., total cavopulmonary connection) for single ventricles avoids extensive suture lines in the right atrium, thereby reducing scarring and higher pressures that lead to IART and sinus node dysfunction. Extracardiac (EC) conduits and lateral tunnel (LT) Fontans are preferred today, and the Fontan conversion procedure (converting prior atriopulmonary Fontans to the EC or LT type) can be performed to reduce arrhythmia and thromboembolic events.",

Each such event is associated with the risk of morbidity and mortality, plus substantial healthcare costs. Consequently, the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend low-molecular-weight heparins, fondaparinux or vitamin K antagonists (usually warfarin) after total hip and knee arthroplasty. However, such agents are also associated with healthcare costs for administration and monitoring. New oral anticoagulants in development may reduce post-arthroplasty symptomatic thromboembolic events and produce potential savings for the healthcare system. This brief article outlines such potential savings with rivaroxaban based on the results of the REgulation of Coagulation in ORthopaedic surgery to prevent Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (RECORD) program.",

The 2007 Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to assess national prevalence of hospitalizations in adults with CHD with septal defects. Co-morbidities and risk factors for mortality were also determined. There were 84,308 adult CHD admissions in the United States in 2007. Fifty-four percent of adult CHD admissions had diagnoses of septal defects, with 48% having atrial septal defect, 7% having VSD, and 0.4% having AVSD. Overall in-hospital mortality was 2.1%. Common co-morbidities included arrhythmias (31%), heart failure (20%), and diabetes mellitus (18%). On multivariable analysis, independent risk factors for mortality included presence of VSD (odds ratio 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5 to 6.5), trisomy 21 (odds ratio 2.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 7.5), and pulmonary hypertension (odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.4). In conclusion, this study of hospitalizations in adults with septal defects found that admissions are common and associated with significant co-morbidities. Overall mortality is low but is increased in patients with VSD. Cardiac and noncardiac co-morbidities are commonly encountered. Many noncardiac conditions, including trisomy 21 and the youngest and oldest groups, are associated with an increased risk of death.",

All patients should be assessed for VTE risk and appropriate prophylaxis should be provided. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis guidelines, hospital protocols, and risk assessment models can guide orthopedic surgeons in making individualized decisions. In cases where guidelines offer no direct recommendations, or disagree, standardized care may need to be tempered by clinical judgment and individual patient considerations. Improved health care and better outcomes can be achieved for orthopedic surgery patients by considering VTE prophylaxis from the viewpoint of the clinical guidelines and patient-specific factors.",

Using mouse models of inflammation-induced gastric cancer, we show that at least 20% of CAFs originate from bone marrow (BM) and derive from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). \u03b1SMA+ myofibroblasts (MFs) are niche cells normally present in BM and increase markedly during cancer progression. MSC-derived CAFs that are recruited to the dysplastic stomach express IL-6, Wnt5\u03b1 and BMP4, show DNA hypomethylation, and promote tumor growth. Moreover, CAFs are generated from MSCs and are recruited to the tumor in a TGF-\u03b2- and SDF-1\u03b1-dependent manner. Therefore, carcinogenesis involves expansion and relocation of BM-niche cells to the tumor to create a niche to sustain cancer progression.",

        "Abstract": "The Global Orthopaedic Registry (GLORY) offers insights into multinational practice patterns of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in orthopedic surgery, based on data from 15,020 patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty or primary total hip arthroplasty from 2001 to 2004. Registry data show that the first choice for in-hospital VTE prophylaxis was low-molecular-weight heparin. Multimodal prophylaxis was common. Warfarin was more widely used in the USA than elsewhere in the world. GLORY data suggest that real-world practice often fails to meet the standards for prophylaxis recommended in the American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based guidelines, particularly in the USA. However, many US orthopedic surgeons may follow other practice guidelines, causing an underestimation of prophylaxis us in this study. Warfarin in the USA often failed to achieve recommended target International Normalized Ratio (INR) values. This paper reviews the GLORY practice findings in light of the contemporary literature on best practices for VTE prophylaxis in orthopedic patients.",

        "Abstract": "This trial compared the efficacy and safety of oral dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, versus subcutaneous enoxaparin for extended thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. A total of 2,055 patients were randomised to 28-35 days treatment with oral dabigatran, 220 mg once-daily, starting with a half-dose 1-4 hours after surgery, or subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once-daily, starting the evening before surgery. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of total venous thromboembolism [VTE] (venographic or symptomatic) and death from all-causes. The main secondary composite outcome was major VTE (proximal deep-vein thrombosis or non-fatal pulmonary embolism) plus VTE-related death. The main safety outcome was major bleeding. In total, 2,013 were treated, of whom 1,577 operated patients were included in the primary efficacy analysis. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 7.7% of the dabigatran group versus 8.8% of the enoxaparin group, risk difference (RD) -1.1% (95%CI -3.8 to 1.6%); p<0.0001 for the pre-specified non-inferiority margin. Major VTE plus VTE-related death occurred in 2.2% of the dabigatran group versus 4.2% of the enoxaparin group, RD -1.9% (-3.6% to -0.2%); p=0.03. Major bleeding occurred in 1.4% of the dabigatran group and 0.9% of the enoxaparin group (p=0.40). The incidence of adverse events, including liver enzyme elevations and cardiac events, during treatment was similar between the groups. Extended prophylaxis with oral dabigatran 220 mg once-daily was as effective as subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once-daily in reducing the risk of VTE after total hip arthroplasty, and superior to enoxaparin for reducing the risk of major VTE. The risk of bleeding and safety profiles were similar.",

        "Abstract": "The \"enhanced intracellular survival\" (eis) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is involved in the intracellular survival of M. smegmatis. However, its exact effects on host cell function remain elusive. We herein report that Mtb Eis plays essential roles in modulating macrophage autophagy, inflammatory responses, and cell death via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent pathway. Macrophages infected with an Mtb eis-deletion mutant H37Rv (Mtb-\u0394eis) displayed markedly increased accumulation of massive autophagic vacuoles and formation of autophagosomes in vitro and in vivo. Infection of macrophages with Mtb-\u0394eis increased the production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-6 over the levels produced by infection with wild-type or complemented strains. Elevated ROS generation in macrophages infected with Mtb-\u0394eis (for which NADPH oxidase and mitochondria were largely responsible) rendered the cells highly sensitive to autophagy activation and cytokine production. Despite considerable activation of autophagy and proinflammatory responses, macrophages infected with Mtb-\u0394eis underwent caspase-independent cell death. This cell death was significantly inhibited by blockade of autophagy and c-Jun N-terminal kinase-ROS signaling, suggesting that excessive autophagy and oxidative stress are detrimental to cell survival. Finally, artificial over-expression of Eis or pretreatment with recombinant Eis abrogated production of both ROS and proinflammatory cytokines, which depends on the N-acetyltransferase domain of the Eis protein. Collectively, these data indicate that Mtb Eis suppresses host innate immune defenses by modulating autophagy, inflammation, and cell death in a redox-dependent manner.",

        "Abstract": "Histidine decarboxylase (HDC), the unique enzyme responsible for histamine generation, is highly expressed in myeloid cells, but its function in these cells is poorly understood. Here we show that Hdc-knockout mice show a high rate of colon and skin carcinogenesis. Using Hdc-EGFP bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice in which EGFP expression is controlled by the Hdc promoter, we show that Hdc is expressed primarily in CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) immature myeloid cells (IMCs) that are recruited early on in chemical carcinogenesis. Transplant of Hdc-deficient bone marrow to wild-type recipients results in increased CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) cell mobilization and reproduces the cancer susceptibility phenotype of Hdc-knockout mice. In addition, Hdc-deficient IMCs promote the growth of tumor allografts, whereas mouse CT26 colon cancer cells downregulate Hdc expression through promoter hypermethylation and inhibit myeloid cell maturation. Exogenous histamine induces the differentiation of IMCs and suppresses their ability to support the growth of tumor allografts. These data indicate key roles for Hdc and histamine in myeloid cell differentiation and CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) IMCs in early cancer development.",

Included among these repressors is BCL6, which was shown to play a critical role in the differentiation of ILT3-Fc-induced T suppressor (Ts) cells. Genes implicated in cell cycle progression were downregulated. Genes encoding numerous inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were also downregulated. In contrast, antiapoptotic genes, as well as members of the WNT and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 pathways, were upregulated. This study elucidates certain important aspects of Ts differentiation and function.",

        "Abstract": "The data on the efficacy of atenolol for long-QT syndrome (LQTS) are controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of atenolol for pediatric patients with LQTS. A retrospective observational study investigating all patients who had LQTS treated with atenolol at two institutions was performed. The study identified 57 patients (23 boys and 34 girls) with a mean QT corrected for heart rate (QTc) of 521 \u00b1 54 ms. The mean age of these patients at diagnosis was 9 \u00b1 6 years. Their clinical manifestations included no symptoms (n = 33, 58%), ventricular tachycardia (n = 10, 18%), syncope (n = 6, 10%), resuscitated sudden cardiac death (n = 4, 7%), atrioventricular block (n = 2, 4%), and bradycardia or presyncope (n = 2, 3%). Of the 57 patients, 13 (22%) had a family history of sudden death. The follow-up period was 5.4 \u00b1 4.5 years. Atenolol at a mean dose of 1.4 \u00b1 0.5 mg/kg/day was administered twice a day for all the patients. The mean maximum heart rate was 132 \u00b1 27 bpm on Holter monitors and 155 \u00b1 16 bpm on exercise treadmill tests, with medication doses titrated up to achieve a maximum heart rate lower than 150 bpm on both tests. During the follow-up period, one patient died (noncompliant with atenolol at the time of death), and the remaining patients had no sudden cardiac death events. Four patients (8%) had recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, three of whom received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (all symptomatic at the time of diagnosis). For three patients (6%), it was necessary to rotate to a different beta-blocker because of side effects or inadequate heart rate control. Atenolol administered twice daily constitutes a valid and effective alternative for the treatment of pediatric patients with LQTS.",

        "Abstract": "Patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty often sustain significant decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit, despite modern techniques and shorter operating times. Reasons for the blood loss include raw bony surfaces, vascular inflammatory tissue, and fragile vessels in elderly patients. Acute postoperative anemia has numerous deleterious effects on patients, including delayed rehabilitation, exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions, higher complication rates, and increased pain. The ability to limit the amount of postoperative bleeding may reduce the amount of postoperative pain that patients experience, ultimately resulting in greater patient satisfaction and smoother postoperative rehabilitation. This article focuses on intraoperative techniques available to limit bleeding, thereby minimizing pain and the need for postoperative transfusion.",

In Bangalore, India, uncle-niece and first cousin marriages are common, presenting the opportunity for an international study involving consanguinity mapping of structural CHD. We sought to explore the recessive model of CHD by conducting a genome-wide linkage analysis utilizing high-density oligonucleotide microarrays and enrolling 83 CHD probands born to unaffected consanguineous parents.",

The long-term sequelae of VTE, such as post-thrombotic syndrome or pulmonary hypertension, can be debilitating with severe morbidity. Conventional anticoagulants have several short-comings: for example, warfarin requires regular coagulation monitoring and low-molecular-weight heparins are inconvenient to use because they require subcutaneous administration. The development of new anticoagulants has focused on 2 classes of compounds: direct thrombin inhibitors and direct factor Xa inhibitors. These new oral agents have shown efficacy in large randomized clinical trials and offer new, more convenient options for anticoagulation.",

However, the use of current drugs, such as low molecular weight heparins, is hampered by their subcutaneous route of administration.

However, in a large number of cases adequate administration of thromboprophylaxis does not seem to occur after total joint arthroplasty. A major challenge in the management of thromboprophylaxis is to balance the benefits of treatment with the risks, including bleeding complications. Another potential barrier to the optimal use of thromboprophylaxis could be the inconvenience of currently available agents. Many surgeons therefore adopt a conservative approach towards thromboprophylaxis. Simplifying therapy with more convenient, efficacious, and safe anticoagulants could change attitudes to anticoagulant use and improve adherence to thromboprophylactic guidelines.",

The international literature offers few reports of synchronous or metachronous volvulus of 2 organs of the gastrointestinal tract. We describe a unique case of a patient who presented with recurrent metachronous volvulus of the sigmoid colon, cecum, and stomach. The patient underwent multiple operations for bowel obstruction, lysis of adhesions, and colon resection. The interesting intraoperative findings were a very long mesentery and peritoneal attachments of the intraabdominal gastrointestinal organs that made the stomach and colon extremely mobile and thus susceptible to volvulus. Prophylactic pexis of the cecum and the stomach during the first operation, in light of the elongated mesentery, may have prevented the subsequent episodes of volvulus.",

        "Abstract": "The prognosis in children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) is guarded, with the 5-year mortality rate ranging from 14% to 50%, owing to sudden cardiac death (SCD) or pump failure. The risk factors for SCD in adults with IDC include asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and poor left ventricular function. It is unclear whether these findings can be extrapolated to the pediatric population. A retrospective review of all patients with the diagnosis of IDC seen at a single institution from 1990 to 2004 was performed. A total of 85 patients (46 males), with a median age of 3.8 years (0 days to 17.3 years) were studied. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 25 +/- 12% (median 23%, range 45% to 45%) at presentation. The following arrhythmias occurred at presentation or during the initial hospitalization: nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 6, sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation in 1, supraventricular arrhythmias in 6, and both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in 1. During a subsequent hospitalization or outpatient follow-up, 7 patients had the following arrhythmias: supraventricular arrhythmias in 2, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 4, and both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in 1. The cumulative survival rate was 40% at a mean follow-up of 6.2 years (95% confidence interval 4.4 to 8.1). One single episode of SCD occurred in 1 patient without a history of sustained arrhythmias. In conclusion, in children with IDC, despite the low left ventricular ejection fraction and presence of ventricular arrhythmias, only one episode of SCD occurred in this group of patients. Given the 1% incidence of SCD in this cohort, the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators as primary prevention in children with IDC might not be indicated.",

        "Title": "Dabigatran etexilate: pivotal trials for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after hip or knee arthroplasty.",
        "Abstract": "Dabigatran etexilate, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, was investigated in 3 large phase III trials for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total hip arthroplasty (RE-NOVATE, N = 3494) or total knee arthroplasty (RE-MODEL, N = 2076 and RE-MOBILIZE, N = 2615). RE-NOVATE and RE-MODEL were conducted mainly in Europe, and RE-MOBILIZE was conducted predominantly in the United States and Canada. This review discusses the results of these trials. In all 3 trials, 2 doses, 220 mg and 150 mg once daily, were compared with enoxaparin. Both RE-MODEL and RE-NOVATE demonstrated noninferiority for the primary outcome (a composite of total VTE events and all-cause mortality), P = .0003 and P < .0001, respectively, for these trials. In 2008, these data formed the basis for European and Canadian approval. While RE-MOBILIZE did not demonstrate noninferiority for the primary outcome (25.3% for enoxaparin vs 31.1% for 220 mg, risk difference +5.8%, 95% CI, 0.8-10.8; P = .02 and 33.7% for 150 mg, risk difference +8.4%, 95% CI, 3.4-13.3; P = .0009), both treatments were similar for the secondary composite outcome (major VTE plus VTErelated mortality; 3.4% with 220 mg, 3.0% with 150 mg, and 2.2% with enoxaparin) and symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (0.8%, 0.7%, and 0.6%). There were no differences in the bleeding rates, hepatic enzyme elevations, or acute coronary syndrome events between the 2 treatments. With the practical advantages of once-daily oral dosing, dabigatran etexilate can be considered an attractive alternative to conventional thromboprophylaxis regimens in patients undergoing elective total hip and knee arthroplasty.",

        "Abstract": "Despite exceptional efficacy and safety, fear of muscle toxicity remains a major reason statins are underutilized. Evidence suggests that statin muscle toxicity may be mediated by abnormalities in lipid metabolism. To test the hypothesis that myotubes from patients intolerant of lipid-lowering therapies have abnormal fatty acid oxidation (FAO) responses we compared muscle from 11 subjects with statin intolerance (Intolerant) with muscle from seven statin-naive volunteers undergoing knee arthroplasty (Comparator). Gross muscle pathology was graded and skeletal muscle cell cultures were produced from each subject. FAO was assessed following treatment with increasing statin concentrations. There was no difference in muscle biopsy myopathy scores between the groups. Basal octanoate oxidation was greater in Intolerant than in Comparator subjects (P = 0.03). Lovastatin-stimulated palmitate oxidation tended to be greater for Intolerant compared to Control subjects' myotubes (P = 0.07 for 5 microM and P = 0.06 for 20 microM lovastatin). In conclusion abnormalities in FAO of Intolerant subjects appear to be an intrinsic characteristic of these subjects that can be measured in their cultured myotubes.",

        "Abstract": "Dabigatran, an oral once-daily unmonitored thrombin inhibitor, has been tested elsewhere using enoxaparin 40 mg once daily. We used the North American enoxaparin 30 mg BID regimen as the comparator. This was a double-blind, centrally randomized trial. Unilateral total knee arthroplasty patients were randomized to receive oral dabigatran etexilate 220 or 150 mg once daily, or enoxaparin 30 mg SC BID after surgery, blinded. Dosing stopped at contrast venography, 12 to 15 days after surgery. Among 1896 patients, dabigatran 220 and 110 mg showed inferior efficacy to enoxaparin (venous thromboembolism rates of 31% [P = .02 vs enoxaparin], 34% [P < .001 vs enoxaparin], and 25%, respectively). Bleeding rates were similar, and no drug-related hepatic illness was recognized. Dabigatran, effective compared to once-daily enoxaparin, showed inferior efficacy to the twice-daily North American enoxaparin regimen, probably because of the latter's more intense and prolonged dosing.",

        "Abstract": "Bordetella bronchiseptica can establish prolonged airway infection consistent with a highly developed ability to evade mammalian host immune responses. Upon initial interaction with the host upper respiratory tract mucosa, B. bronchiseptica are subjected to antimicrobial reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), effector molecules of the innate immune system. However, the responses of B. bronchiseptica to redox species at physiologically relevant concentrations (nM-microM) have not been investigated. Using predicted physiological concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on low numbers of CFU of B. bronchiseptica, all redox active species displayed dose-dependent antimicrobial activity. Susceptibility to individual redox active species was significantly increased upon introduction of a second species at subantimicrobial concentrations. An increased bacteriostatic activity of NO was observed relative to H2O2. The understanding of Bordetella responses to physiologically relevant levels of exogenous RNS and ROS will aid in defining the role of endogenous production of these molecules in host innate immunity against Bordetella and other respiratory pathogens.",

The maintenance of AV synchrony is physiologically optimal in this setting.

        "Abstract": "Previous studies indicate that the triterpene glycoside actein from the herb black cohosh inhibits growth of human breast cancer cells. This study seeks to identify genes altered in human breast cancer cells by treatment with actein, using gene expression analysis. We treated MDA-MB-453 human breast cancer cells with actein at 2 doses, 20 or 40 microg/mL, for 6 or 24 hr. We identified 5 genes that were activated after each of the treatments that are known to play a role in cellular responses to diverse stresses, including the DNA damage and unfolded protein responses. In addition, four genes that mediate the integrated stress response (ISR), including activating transcription factor 4, were induced under at least one of the 4 treatment conditions. We used hierarchical clustering to define clusters comprising patterns of gene expression. Two ISR genes, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and DNA damage- inducible transcript 3, and lipid biosynthetic genes were activated after exposure to actein at 40 microg/mL for 6 hr, whereas the cell cycle genes cyclin E2 and cell division cycle 25A were repressed. Our results suggest that actein induces 2 phases of the ISR, the survival phase and the apoptotic phase, depending on the dose and duration of treatment. We confirmed the results of gene expression analysis with real-time RT-PCR for 18 selected genes and Western blot analysis for ATF3. Since actein activated transcription factors that enhance apoptosis, and repressed cell cycle genes, it may be useful in the prevention and therapy of breast cancer.",

        "Abstract": "The human serine protease inhibitor (serpin) gene cluster at 14q32.1 comprises 11 serpin genes, many of which are expressed specifically in hepatic cells. Previous studies identified a locus control region (LCR) upstream of the human alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT) gene that is required for gene activation, chromatin remodeling, and histone acetylation throughout the proximal serpin subcluster. Here we show that the LCR interacts with multiple liver-specific transcription factors, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta (HNF-3beta), HNF-6alpha, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), and C/EBPbeta. RNA polymerase II is also recruited to the locus through the LCR. Nongenic transcription at both the LCR and an upstream regulatory region was detected, but the deletion of the LCR abolished transcription at both sites. The deletion of HNF-3 and HNF-6 binding sites within the LCR reduced histone acetylation at both the LCR and the upstream regulatory region and decreased the transcription of the alpha1AT, corticosteroid binding globulin, and protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor genes. These results suggest that the LCR activates genes in the proximal serpin subcluster by recruiting liver-specific transcription factors and components of the general transcription machinery to regulatory regions upstream of the alpha1AT gene.",

        "Abstract": "At its inception, psychoanalytic psychology heavily emphasized sexuality. Freud's ideas about the centrality of sexuality in development and in the etiology of psychopathology were accepted for many years by organized psychoanalysis and psychiatry. Modern psychoanalytic theory has replaced sexuality as an organizing concept with diverse paradigms and the field has fragmented as a result. Of the many theories that Freud posed about the role of sexuality in psychological functioning perhaps his most influential were those pertaining to the Oedipus complex. In this, the first article of a series on the psychodynamic aspects of human sexuality, Oedipal aggression in males is considered from a biopsychosocial perspective. Knowledge about sexual differentiation of the brain and sex differences in behavior resulting from research carried out after Freud's death suggests the need to revise Freud's ideas about the Oedipus complex.",

It also addresses long-standing issues of interoperability, adaptability, and data sharing, including clinical data, across organizational boundaries by creating models based on nationally accepted technical standards. Perhaps most significantly, MITA allows State Medicaid Programs to actively participate in the DHHS Secretary's vision of a transparent health care market that utilizes electronic health records (EHRs), ePrescribing and personal health records (PHRs).",

        "Abstract": "Valve lesions in degenerative calcific aortic stenosis (CAS), a disorder affecting 3% of those older than 75 years, are infiltrated by T lymphocytes. We sought to determine whether the alphabeta TCR repertoire of these valve-infiltrating lymphocytes exhibited features either of a polyclonal nonselective response to inflammation or contained expanded clones suggesting a more specific immune process. TCR beta-chain CDR3-length distribution analysis using PCR primers specific for 23 Vbeta families performed in eight individuals with CAS affecting tri- or bileaflet aortic valves revealed considerable oligoclonal T cell expansion. In five cases, beta-chain nucleotide sequencing in five selected Vbeta families showed that an average of 92% of the valve-infiltrating T cell repertoire consisted of expanded T cell clones, differing markedly in composition from the relatively more polyclonal peripheral CD8 or CD4 T cell subsets found even in this elderly population. Twenty-four of the valve-infiltrating T cell clones also had the same clone identified in blood, some of which were highly expanded. Interestingly, 22 of these 24 shared clones were CD8 in lineage (p = 1.5 x 10(-12)), suggesting a possible relationship to the expanded CD8(+)CD28(-) T cell clones frequently present in the elderly. Additionally, the sequences of several TCR beta-chain CDR3 regions were homologous to TCR beta-chains identified previously in allograft arteriosclerosis. We infer that these findings are inconsistent with a nonselective secondary response of T cells to inflammation and instead suggest that clonally expanded alphabeta T cells are implicated in mediating a component of the valvular injury responsible for CAS.",

        "Abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis is responsible for nearly 3 million human deaths worldwide every year. Understanding the mechanisms and bacterial factors responsible for the ability of M. tuberculosis to cause disease in humans is critical for the development of improved treatment strategies. Many bacterial pathogens use pili as adherence factors to colonize the host. We discovered that M. tuberculosis produces fine (2- to 3-nm-wide), aggregative, flexible pili that are recognized by IgG antibodies contained in sera obtained from patients with active tuberculosis, indicating that the bacilli produce pili or pili-associated antigen during human infection. Purified M. tuberculosis pili (MTP) are composed of low-molecular-weight protein subunits encoded by the predicted M. tuberculosis H37Rv ORF, designated Rv3312A. MTP bind to the extracellular matrix protein laminin in vitro, suggesting that MTP possess adhesive properties. Isogenic mtp mutants lost the ability to produce Mtp in vitro and demonstrated decreased laminin-binding capabilities. MTP shares morphological, biochemical, and functional properties attributed to bacterial pili, especially with curli amyloid fibers. Thus, we propose that MTP are previously unidentified host-colonization factors of M. tuberculosis.",

        "Abstract": "Elective total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty are associated with a high risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism. Traditionally, antithrombotic prophylaxis has been administered during the hospital stay. However, with patients spending less time in the hospital after surgery, there is a need to continue thromboprophylaxis beyond hospital discharge. The current recommendation for prophylaxis in total joint arthroplasty patients is a minimum of 10 days, with extended prophylaxis up to 28 to 35 days following total hip arthroplasty. Prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparins for approximately 4 weeks following hip arthroplasty has resulted in clinically significant reductions in the incidence of venographically confirmed deep vein thrombosis. Currently, no data support extended thromboprophylaxis beyond 10 days following total knee arthroplasty. Using weighted risk factors to assess individual risk for venous thromboembolism can help the physician determine the optimal duration of prophylaxis.",

        "Abstract": "The eis gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been shown to play a role in the survival of the avirulent Mycobacterium smegmatis within the macrophage. In vitro and in vivo analysis of Deltaeis deletion mutants and complemented strains showed no effect on survival of M. tuberculosis in U-937 macrophages or in a mouse aerosol infection model, respectively. Further studies were done in an attempt to determine the role of eis in M. tuberculosis intracellular survival and to define a phenotypic difference between wild-type and the Deltaeis deletion mutant. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that Eis is an acetyltransferase of the GCN5-related family of N-acetyltransferases. Immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis studies demonstrated that Eis is released into the cytoplasm of M. tuberculosis-infected U-937 macrophages. Eis was also found in the extravesicular fraction and culture supernatant of M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages. The effect of Eis on human macrophage cytokine secretion was also examined. Eis modulated the secretion of IL-10 and TNF-alpha by primary human monocytes in response both to infection with M. tuberculosis and to stimulation with recombinant Eis protein. These results suggest that Eis is a mycobacterial effector that is released into the host cell to modulate inflammatory responses, possibly via transcriptional or post-translational means.",

It has a much wider patient base, and flexible models of duration and frequency of treatment. Its assumptions also rest on scientifically validated data to a much larger degree than psychoanalysis. A sturdier identity might help psychodynamic psychiatry stand alongside bio-descriptive psychiatry as a core component of American Psychiatry.",

However, significant differences in the cultures underlying these two disciplines pose barriers to a uniform educational solution. This paper recounts the experience at Columbia University in adapting a graduate program with an initial focus on clinical informatics to train bioinformaticians. The analysis begins by considering the development of the medical and biological informatics cultures over a 17-year period. Then we review how two separate curricula evolved to serve the needs of each group. Interviews with bioinformatics students and faculty indicated some dissatisfaction with the curriculum that developed within clinical informatics. Their comments are considered in the light of an analysis of the relationship between the application domains of biomedical informatics as a discipline. In response, a new curriculum was developed in which bioinformatics and clinical informatics are regarded as subdivisions of the same subject. A key feature of this curriculum is a new course, Theory and Methods in Biomedical Informatics, which presents informatics principles in their general form, and illustrates their application with examples drawn from across the biomedical spectrum. The paper concludes with suggestions for integrating informatics training programs at other institutions.",

Of these patients, 44% had been prescribed psychotropic medication on a daily basis for at least 2 weeks during the present treatment. Patients treated for the longest time (5 years or more) were the most seriously psychiatrically disturbed. Patients improved with psychotherapy, and the improvement was related to the duration of treatment. The combined impact of diagnosis status, treatment duration, and treatment modalities provided a consistent pattern of treatment effectiveness.",

        "Abstract": "The acute central nervous system effects of relaxation techniques (RT) have not been systematically studied. We conducted a controlled, randomized study of the central nervous system effects of RT using spectral analysis of EEG activity. Thirty-six subjects were randomized to either RT or a music comparison condition. After listening to an RT audiotape or music audiotapes daily for 6 weeks, the acute central nervous system effects of RT and music were measured using power spectral analysis of alpha and theta EEG activity in all cortical regions. RT produced significantly greater increases in theta activity in multiple cortical regions compared to the music condition. These findings are consistent with widespread reductions in cortical arousal during RT. They extend previous findings and suggest that theta, and not alpha, EEG may be the most reliable marker of the central nervous system effects of RT. These findings demonstrate that RT produce greater reductions in central nervous system activity than a credible comparison condition. The findings suggest that RT represent a hypoactive central nervous system state that may be similar to Stage 1 sleep and that RT may exert their therapeutic effects, in part, through cerebral energy conservation/restoration.",

        "Abstract": "Reporter systems efficient at monitoring temporal gene expression in slow-growing mycobacteria would significantly aid the characterization of gene expression in specific environments. Bacterial luciferase is a reporter that has not been widely used to study gene expression in mycobacteria. This report describes the determination of the degradation of bacterial luciferase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra and its utility as a reporter of temporal gene expression in this slow-growing mycobacterium. The inducible/repressible alanine dehydrogenase promoter of M. tuberculosis H37Rv was used to track the decay kinetics of Vibrio harveyi luciferase in both mid-log phase and stationary phase grown M. tuberculosis H37Ra, which proved to be highly similar during both phases of growth. The luciferase reporter was then used to detect changes in expression from the heat-shock promoter, phsp60, of M. bovis BCG during M. tuberculosis H37Ra growth in culture. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of groEL2, the hsp60 homologue in M. tuberculosis, displayed a similar pattern of expression to phsp60-driven luciferase. These results strongly suggest that the luciferase reporter can be used to monitor temporal changes in gene expression in M. tuberculosis and may serve as a novel system to examine gene expression under specific conditions.",

        "Abstract": "To further understand Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis, the regulation of potential virulence genes needs to be investigated. The eis gene of M. tuberculosis H37Rv enhances the intracellular survival of Mycobacterium smegmatis, which does not contain eis, within macrophages (J. Wei, J. L. Dahl, J. W. Moulder, E. A. Roberts, P. O'Gaora, D. B. Young, and R. L. Friedman, J. Bacteriol. 182:377-384, 2000). Experiments were done to characterize the eis promoter in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis H37Ra. The putative -10 and -35 regions matched the Escherichia coli sigma(70) consensus 67 and 83%, respectively, making it a group A/SigA-like mycobacterial promoter. Expression of site-directed variants of the core promoter region, determined by flow cytometry using gfp as a reporter, showed that the putative -10 region is essential for eis expression. In addition, site-directed alteration of the eis promoter to the consensus E. coli sigma(70) promoter elements increased gfp transcription to levels similar to that driven by the heat shock promoter, phsp60, of Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Upstream promoter deletion analysis showed that a 200- and 412-bp region of the promoter was necessary for maximum expression of gfp in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis H37Ra, respectively. Random mutagenesis of the 412-bp eis promoter, using a catechol 2,3-dioxygenase screen and activity assay, defined nucleotides upstream of the core promoter region that are essential to eis expression in both M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis H37Ra, including a region homologous to a DinR cis element.",

        "Abstract": "Gene expression profiles of resected tumors may predict treatment response and outcome. We hypothesized that profiles derived from lung tumor biopsies would discriminate tumor-specific gene signatures and provide predictive information about outcome. Lung carcinoma specimens were obtained from 23 patients undergoing computed tomography-guided transthoracic biopsy or endobronchial brushing for undiagnosed nodules. Excess tissue was processed for gene profiling. We built class prediction models for lung cancer histology and for cancer outcome. The histology model used an F test to identify 99 genes that were differentially expressed among lung cancer subtypes. The histology validation set class prediction accuracy rate was 86%. The outcome model used the maximum difference subset algorithm to identify 42 genes associated with high risk for cancer death. The outcome training set class prediction accuracy rate was 87%. In conclusion, gene expression profiles of biopsy specimens of lung cancers identify unique tumoral signatures that provide information about tissue morphology and prognosis. The use of specimens acquired from lung biopsy procedures to identify biomarkers of clinical outcome may have application in the management of patients with lung cancer. The procedures are safe and feasible; the efficacy and utility of this strategy will ultimately be determined by prospective clinical trials.",

        "Title": "Sequence organization and matrix attachment regions of the human serine protease inhibitor gene cluster at 14q32.1.",
        "Abstract": "The human serine protease inhibitor (serpin) gene cluster at 14q32.1 is a useful model system for studying the regulation of gene activity and chromatin structure. We demonstrated previously that the six known serpin genes in this region were organized into two subclusters of three genes each that occupied approximately 370 kb of DNA. To more fully understand the genomic organization of this region, we annotated a 1-Mb sequence contig from data from the Genoscope sequencing consortium (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/ ). We report that 11 different serpin genes reside within the 14q32.1 cluster, including two novel alpha1-antiproteinase-like gene sequences, a kallistatin-like sequence, and two recently identified serpins that had not been mapped previously to 14q32.1. The genomic regions proximal and distal to the serpin cluster contain a variety of unrelated gene sequences of diverse function. To gain insight into the chromatin organization of the region, sequences with putative nuclear matrix-binding potential were identified by using the MAR-Wiz algorithm, and these MAR-Wiz candidate sequences were tested for nuclear matrix-binding activity in vitro. Several differences between the MAR-Wiz predictions and the results of biochemical tests were observed. The genomic organization of the serpin gene cluster is discussed.",

        "Abstract": "This essay responds to D. Davis and W. C. Follette (2002), who question the value of motive evidence in murder cases. They argue that the evidence that a husband had extramarital affairs, that he heavily insured his wife's life, or that he battered his wife is ordinarily of infinitesimal probative value. We disagree. To be sure, it would be foolish to predict solely on the basis of such evidence that a husband will murder his wife. However, when this kind of evidence is combined with other evidence in a realistic murder case, the evidence can be quite probative. We analyze cases in which it is virtually certain that the victim was murdered but unclear who murdered her, and in which it is uncertain whether the husband murdered the wife or she died by accident. We show that in each case motive evidence, such as a history of battering or of infidelity, can substantially increase the odds of the husband's guilt. We also consider the actual case on which Davis and Follette base their paper. We argue that testimony of Davis on the basis of the analysis presented in their paper was properly excluded, for it would have been misleading and unhelpful.",

        "Abstract": "Approximately 60% of children with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) develop their initial episode by 1 year of age. Despite resolution in most of these patients by 1 year, approximately 30% of the SVT will recur. We performed a retrospective review of all patients <1 year of age with SVT between January 1984 and December 2000. Recurrence was defined as documented SVT at >1 year of age. Patients were divided into: (1) a first line (FL) group (controlled with digoxin and/or propranolol) and (2) a second line (SL) group (requiring additional antiarrhythmics). The groups were divided based on the presence of preexcitation. The FL group included 116 patients, 20 of whom (17%) had Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. The SL group included 34 patients, 21 of whom (62%) had WPW (p <0.001). Recurrence of SVT occurred in 32 patients (28%) in the FL group and in 23 patients (68%) in the SL group (p <0.001). SVT recurred in 36 of 41 patients (88%) with WPW compared with 19 of 109 patients (17%) without WPW syndrome (p <0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the presence of WPW syndrome was associated with a 29-fold higher odds of SVT recurrence (p <0.001), and that patients with WPW syndrome were more likely to require additional antiarrhythmic therapy (p <0.001). Thus, patients with WPW syndrome who had SVT at <1 year of age have 29-fold higher odds of recurrence at >1 year of age versus those patients with preexcitation. These patients are also more likely to require additional antiarrhythmic therapy to control SVT. Furthermore, children with WPW syndrome who are refractory to treatment with digoxin and/or propranolol are at increased risk of SVT recurrence.",

Multiple controlled clinical trials and several meta-analyses of these data have examined various agents in different regimens. These data indicate that extended prophylaxis with a low-molecular-weight heparin after knee or hip arthroplasty significantly reduces the number of venous thromboembolic episodes with no increases in major bleeding. The data also show that > 98% of patients given long-term low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis remain free from symptomatic deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Therefore, to minimize patient risk safely and cost-effectively, extended prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin once-daily for 4 weeks after surgery should be considered for patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty.",

        "Title": "The emergence of protocadherin-PC expression during the acquisition of apoptosis-resistance by prostate cancer cells.",
        "Abstract": "In order to identify gene products associated with the development of acquired therapeutic resistance by prostate cancer cells, we created two novel apoptosis-resistant prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP-TR (phorbol-ester [TPA]-Resistant) and LNCaP-SSR (Serum Starvation-Resistant) by repeated transient exposure of cultured human LNCaP cells to apoptotic stimuli followed by expansion of surviving cell populations. These cell lines were found to be cross-resistant to the alternative selective agent and also hormone-resistant when xenografted into castrated male immunodeficient mice. RNA from the LNCaP-TR line was comparatively screened using a subtractive hybridization-PCR procedure. This allowed us to identify a 249 bp cDNA fragment that hybridized to a 4.8 kb mRNA preferentially expressed by the apoptosis-resistant cells. Using RACE procedures, we cloned and sequenced the complete 4.8 kb cDNA. It is an unusual member of the protocadherin gene family containing two large overlapping open reading frames encoding homologous polypeptides, one having a signal sequence and the other lacking a signal sequence and we refer to it as protocadherin-PC. LNCaP cells directly transformed with protocadherin-PC cDNA were comparatively resistant to phorbol-ester induced apoptosis. Antibody recognition studies demonstrating the cytoplasmic nature of the protcadherin-PC translation product and its propensity to bind beta-catenin suggest that it might influence the apoptotic sensitivity of prostate cancer cells through a unique mechanism.",

        "Title": "Gene expression in Wilms' tumor mimics the earliest committed stage in the metanephric mesenchymal-epithelial transition.",
        "Abstract": "Wilms' tumor (WT) has been considered a prototype for arrested cellular differentiation in cancer, but previous studies have relied on selected markers. We have now performed an unbiased survey of gene expression in WTs using oligonucleotide microarrays. Statistical criteria identified 357 genes as differentially expressed between WTs and fetal kidneys. This set contained 124 matches to genes on a microarray used by Stuart and colleagues (Stuart RO, Bush KT, Nigam SK: Changes in global gene expression patterns during development and maturation of the rat kidney. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2001, 98:5649-5654) to establish genes with stage-specific expression in the developing rat kidney. Mapping between the two data sets showed that WTs systematically overexpressed genes corresponding to the earliest stage of metanephric development, and underexpressed genes corresponding to later stages. Automated clustering identified a smaller group of 27 genes that were highly expressed in WTs compared to fetal kidney and heterologous tumor and normal tissues. This signature set was enriched in genes encoding transcription factors. Four of these, PAX2, EYA1, HBF2, and HOXA11, are essential for cell survival and proliferation in early metanephric development, whereas others, including SIX1, MOX1, and SALL2, are predicted to act at this stage. SIX1 and SALL2 proteins were expressed in the condensing mesenchyme in normal human fetal kidneys, but were absent (SIX1) or reduced (SALL2) in cells at other developmental stages. These data imply that the blastema in WTs has progressed to the committed stage in the mesenchymal-epithelial transition, where it is partially arrested in differentiation. The WT-signature set also contained the Wnt receptor FZD7, the tumor antigen PRAME, the imprinted gene NNAT and the metastasis-associated transcription factor E1AF.",

        "Abstract": "A multicenter prospective study was designed and implemented as an activity of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society to assess the risks associated with radiofrequency ablation in children. Patients (age 0-15 years) with supraventricular tachycardia due to accessory pathways or atrioventricular nodal reentry were enrolled and studied prior to ablation and periodically by clinical evaluation, electrocardiogram (ECG), Holter monitor, and echocardiogram. In addition, a national registry was established, to which the contributing centers report all pediatric patients undergoing ablation at their center. Initial electrophysiological study tracings and all noninvasive studies undergo blinded outside review for quality control. Clinical endpoints were death, recurrence, proarrhythmia, and echocardiographic abnormality. A pilot study demonstrated excellent agreement concerning diagnoses of previously reported ablation patients between the reporting center and the blinded reviewer (kappa = 0.938 +/- 0.062). A total of 317 patients were enrolled in the ongoing study from April 1, 1999 to December 31, 2000. The success rate of ablations was 96% with a complication rate of 4.3% for electrophysiological study and 2.9% for the ablation procedure. Comparison of the registry group versus the study group shows that the groups are comparable in terms of patient characteristics, diagnoses, and the results of ablation making it less likely that the sample of prospectively enrolled patients is biased.",
