        "Abstract": "Alternative splicing plays a crucial role in protein diversity and gene expression regulation in higher eukaryotes, and mutations causing dysregulated splicing underlie a range of genetic diseases. Computational prediction of alternative splicing from genomic sequences not only provides insight into gene-regulatory mechanisms but also helps identify disease-causing mutations and drug targets. However, the current methods for the quantitative prediction of splice site usage still have limited accuracy. Here, we present DeltaSplice, a deep neural network model optimized to learn the impact of mutations on quantitative changes in alternative splicing from the comparative analysis of homologous genes. The model architecture enables DeltaSplice to perform \"reference-informed prediction\" by incorporating the known splice site usage of a reference gene sequence to improve its prediction on splicing-altering mutations. We benchmarked DeltaSplice and several other state-of-the-art methods on various prediction tasks, including evolutionary sequence divergence on lineage-specific splicing and splicing-altering mutations in human populations and neurodevelopmental disorders, and demonstrated that DeltaSplice outperformed consistently. DeltaSplice predicted \u223c15% of splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) in the human brain as causal splicing-altering variants. It also predicted splicing-altering de novo mutations outside the splice sites in a subset of patients affected by autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including 19 genes with recurrent splicing-altering mutations. Integration of splicing-altering mutations with other types of de novo mutation burdens allowed the prediction of eight novel NDD-risk genes. Our work expanded the capacity of in silico splicing models with potential applications in genetic diagnosis and the development of splicing-based precision medicine.",

        "Abstract": "The regulation of exon inclusion through alternative splicing tunes the cell's behavior by increasing the functional diversity of the transcriptome and the proteome. Splicing factors work in concert to generate gene isoform pools that contribute to cell phenotypes yet their activity is controlled by multiple regulatory and signaling layers. This hinders identification of functional, phenotype-specific splicing factors using traditional single-omic measurements, such as their mutational state or expression. To address this challenge, we propose repurposing the virtual inference of protein activity by enriched regulon analysis (VIPER) to measure splicing factor activity solely from their downstream exon transcriptomic inclusion signatures. This approach is effective in assessing the effect of co-occurring splicing factor perturbations, as well as their post-translational regulation. As proof of concept, we dissect recurrent splicing factor programs underlying tumorigenesis including aberrantly activated factors acting as oncogenes and inactivated ones acting as tumor suppressors, which are undetectable by more conventional methodologies. Activation and inactivation of these cancer splicing programs effectively stratifies overall survival, as well as cancer hallmarks such as proliferation and immune evasion. Altogether, repurposing network-based inference of protein activity for splicing factor networks distills common, functionally relevant splicing programs in otherwise heterogeneous molecular contexts.",

Current studies linking individual RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to AS in a few neuron types underscore the need for holistic modeling. Here, we use network reverse engineering to derive a map of the neuron type-specific AS regulatory landscape from 133 mouse neocortical cell types defined by single-cell transcriptomes. This approach reliably inferred the regulons of 350 RBPs and their cell type-specific activities. Our analysis revealed driving factors delineating neuronal identities, among which we validated Elavl2 as a key RBP for MGE-specific splicing in GABAergic interneurons using an in vitro ESC differentiation system. We also identified a module of exons and candidate regulators specific for long- and short-projection neurons across multiple neuronal classes. This study provides a resource for elucidating splicing regulatory programs that drive neuronal molecular diversity, including those that do not align with gene expression-based classifications.",

        "Abstract": "Divergence of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) alternative splicing (AS) is widespread in mammals, including primates, but the underlying mechanisms and functional impact are poorly understood. Here, we modeled cassette exon inclusion in primate brains as a quantitative trait and identified 1,170 (\u223c3%) exons with lineage-specific splicing shifts under stabilizing selection. Among them, microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) exons 2 and 10 underwent anticorrelated, two-step evolutionary shifts in the catarrhine and hominoid lineages, leading to their present inclusion levels in humans. The developmental-stage-specific divergence of exon 10 splicing, whose dysregulation can cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), is mediated by divergent distal intronic MBNL-binding sites. Competitive binding of these sites by CRISPR-dCas13d/gRNAs effectively reduces exon 10 inclusion, potentially providing a therapeutically compatible approach to modulate tau isoform expression. Our data suggest adaptation of MAPT function and, more generally, a role for AS in the evolutionary expansion of the primate brain.",

        "Abstract": "Breast cancer patients often have a poor prognosis largely due to lack of effective targeted therapy. It is now well established that monosaccharide enhances growth retardation and chemotherapy sensitivity in tumor cells. We investigated whether D-arabinose has capability to restrict the proliferation of tumor cells and its mechanism. Here, we report that D-arabinose induced cytotoxicity is modulated by autophagy and p38 MAPK signaling pathway in breast cancer cell lines. The proliferation of cells was evaluated by CCK-8 and Colony formation assay. The distribution of cells in cell cycle phases was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle, autophagy and MAPK signaling related proteins were detected by western blotting. Mouse xenograft model was used to evaluate the efficacy of D-arabinose in vivo. The proliferation of cells was dramatically inhibited by D-arabinose exposure in a dose-dependent manner, which was relevant to cell cycle arrest, as demonstrated by G2/M cell cycle restriction and ectopic expression of cell cycle related proteins. Mechanistically, we further identified that D-arabinose is positively associated with autophagy and the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling in breast cancer. In contrast, 3-Ma or SB203580, the inhibitor of autophagy or p38 MAPK, reversed the efficacy of D-arabinose. Additionally, D-arabinose in vivo treatment could significantly inhibit xenograft growth of breast cancer cells. Our findings were the first to reveal that D-arabinose triggered cell cycle arrest by inducing autophagy through the activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway in breast cancer cells.",

        "Abstract": "Pre-mRNA splicing, a key process in gene expression, can be therapeutically modulated using various drug modalities, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). However, determining promising targets is hampered by the challenge of systematically mapping splicing-regulatory elements (SREs) in their native sequence context. Here, we use the catalytically inactive CRISPR-RfxCas13d RNA-targeting system (dCas13d/gRNA) as a programmable platform to bind SREs and modulate splicing by competing against endogenous splicing factors. SpliceRUSH, a high-throughput screening method, was developed to map SREs in any gene of interest using a lentivirus gRNA library that tiles the genetic region, including distal intronic sequences. When applied to SMN2, a therapeutic target for spinal muscular atrophy, SpliceRUSH robustly identifies not only known SREs but also a previously unknown distal intronic SRE, which can be targeted to alter exon 7 splicing using either dCas13d/gRNA or ASOs. This technology enables a deeper understanding of splicing regulation with applications for RNA-based drug discovery.",

        "Abstract": "Alternative splicing plays a crucial role in protein diversity and gene expression regulation in higher eukaryotes and mutations causing dysregulated splicing underlie a range of genetic diseases. Computational prediction of alternative splicing from genomic sequences not only provides insight into gene-regulatory mechanisms but also helps identify disease-causing mutations and drug targets. However, the current methods for the quantitative prediction of splice site usage still have limited accuracy. Here, we present DeltaSplice, a deep neural network model optimized to learn the impact of mutations on quantitative changes in alternative splicing from the comparative analysis of homologous genes. The model architecture enables DeltaSplice to perform \"reference-informed prediction\" by incorporating the known splice site usage of a reference gene sequence to improve its prediction on splicing-altering mutations. We benchmarked DeltaSplice and several other state-of-the-art methods on various prediction tasks, including evolutionary sequence divergence on lineage-specific splicing and splicing-altering mutations in human populations and neurodevelopmental disorders, and demonstrated that DeltaSplice outperformed consistently. DeltaSplice predicted ~15% of splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) in the human brain as causal splicing-altering variants. It also predicted splicing-altering ",

This knowledge gap is due to the challenge of precisely mapping the crosslink sites in protein and RNA simultaneously in their native sequence and structural contexts. Here we systematically analyze protein-RNA interactions and photo-crosslinking by bridging crosslinked nucleotides and amino acids mapped using different assays with protein-RNA complex structures. We developed a computational method PxR3D-map which reliably predicts crosslink sites using structural information characterizing protein-RNA interaction interfaces. Analysis of the informative features revealed that photo-crosslinking is facilitated by base stacking with not only aromatic residues, but also dipeptide bonds that involve glycine, and distinct mechanisms are utilized by different RNA-binding domains. Our work suggests protein-RNA photo-crosslinking is highly selective in the cellular environment, which can guide data interpretation and further technology development for UV-crosslinking-based assays.",

        "Abstract": "In the process of green and smart mine construction under the context of carbon neutrality, China's coal safety situation has been continuously improved in recent years. In order to recognize the development of coal production in China and prepare for future monitoring and prevention of safety incidents, this study mainly elaborated on\u00a0the basic situation of coal resources and national mining accidents over the past five\u00a0years\u00a0 (2017-2021), from four dimensions (accident level, type, region, and time), and then proposed the preventive measures based on accident statistical laws. The results show that the storage of coal resources has obvious geographic\u00a0characteristics, mainly concentrated in the Midwest, with coal resources in Shanxi and Shaanxi accounting for about 49.4%. The proportion of coal consumption has dropped from 70.2% to 56% between 2011\u00a0and\u00a02021, but still accounts for more than half\u00a0of the\u00a0all. Meanwhile, the accident-prone areas are positively correlated with the amount of coal production. Among different levels of coal mine accidents, general accidents had the highest number of accidents and deaths, with 692 accidents and 783 deaths, accounting for 87.6% and 54.64% respectively. The frequency of roof, gas, and transportation accidents is relatively high, and the number of single fatalities caused by gas accidents is the largest, about 4.18. In terms of\u00a0geographical distribution of accidents, the safety situation in Shanxi Province is the most severe. From the time distribution of coal mine accidents, the accidents mainly occurred in July and August, and rarely occurred in February and December. Finally, the \"4\u2009+\u20094\" safety management model is proposed, combining the statistical results with coal production in China. Based on the\u00a0existing health and safety management systems, the managements are divided into four sub-categories, and more specific measures are suggested.",

        "Abstract": "The specification of synaptic properties is fundamental for the function of neuronal circuits. \"Terminal selector\" transcription factors coordinate terminal gene batteries that specify cell-type-specific properties. Moreover, pan-neuronal splicing regulators have been implicated in directing neuronal differentiation. However, the cellular logic of how splicing regulators instruct specific synaptic properties remains poorly understood. Here, we combine genome-wide mapping of mRNA targets and cell-type-specific loss-of-function studies to uncover the contribution of the RNA-binding protein SLM2 to hippocampal synapse specification. Focusing on pyramidal cells and somatostatin (SST)-positive GABAergic interneurons, we find that SLM2 preferentially binds and regulates alternative splicing of transcripts encoding synaptic proteins. In the absence of SLM2, neuronal populations exhibit normal intrinsic properties, but there are non-cell-autonomous synaptic phenotypes and associated defects in a hippocampus-dependent memory task. Thus, alternative splicing provides a critical layer of gene regulation that instructs specification of neuronal connectivity in a trans-synaptic manner.",

        "Abstract": "Control over gene expression is exerted, in multiple stages of spermatogenesis, at the post-transcriptional level by RNA binding proteins (RBPs). We identify here an essential role in mammalian spermatogenesis and male fertility for 'RNA binding protein 46' (RBM46). A highly evolutionarily conserved gene, Rbm46 is also essential for fertility in both flies and fish. We found Rbm46 expression was restricted to the mouse germline, detectable in males in the cytoplasm of premeiotic spermatogonia and meiotic spermatocytes. To define its requirement for spermatogenesis, we generated Rbm46 knockout (KO, Rbm46-/-) mice; although male Rbm46-/- mice were viable and appeared grossly normal, they were infertile. Testes from adult Rbm46-/- mice were small, with seminiferous tubules containing only Sertoli cells and few undifferentiated spermatogonia. Using genome-wide unbiased high throughput assays RNA-seq and 'enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation' coupled with RNA-seq (eCLIP-seq), we discovered RBM46 could bind, via a U-rich conserved consensus sequence, to a cohort of mRNAs encoding proteins required for completion of differentiation and subsequent meiotic initiation. In summary, our studies support an essential role for RBM46 in regulating target mRNAs during spermatogonia differentiation prior to the commitment to meiosis in mice.",

        "Abstract": "The Mars' climate is cold and dry in the most recent epoch, and liquid water activities are considered extremely limited. Previous orbital data only show sporadic hydrous minerals in the northern lowlands of Mars excavated by large impacts. Using the short-wave infrared spectral data obtained by the Zhurong rover of China's Tianwen-1 mission, which landed in southern Utopia Planitia on Mars, we identify hydrated sulfate/silica materials on the Amazonian terrain at the landing site. These hydrated minerals are associated with bright-toned rocks, interpreted to be duricrust developed locally. The lithified duricrusts suggest that formation with substantial liquid water originates by either groundwater rising or subsurface ice melting. In situ evidence for aqueous activities identified at Zhurong's landing site indicates a more active Amazonian hydrosphere for Mars than previously thought.",

        "Abstract": "To control sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial Notch signaling suppresses tip cell formation, migration, and proliferation while promoting barrier formation. Each of these responses may be regulated by distinct Notch-regulated effectors. Notch activity is highly dynamic in sprouting endothelial cells, while constitutive Notch signaling drives homeostatic endothelial polarization, indicating the need for both rapid and constitutive Notch targets. In contrast to previous screens that focus on genes regulated by constitutively active Notch, we characterized the dynamic response to Notch. We examined transcriptional changes from 1.5 to 6\u00a0h after Notch signal activation via ligand-specific or EGTA induction in cultured primary human endothelial cells and neonatal mouse brain. In each combination of endothelial type and Notch manipulation, transcriptomic analysis identified distinct but overlapping sets of rapidly regulated genes and revealed many novel Notch target genes. Among the novel Notch-regulated signaling pathways identified were effectors in GPCR signaling, notably, the constitutively active GTPase RND1. In endothelial cells, RND1 was shown to be a novel direct Notch transcriptional target and required for Notch control of sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial migration, and Ras activity. We conclude that RND1 is directly regulated by endothelial Notch signaling in a rapid fashion in order to suppress endothelial migration.",

        "Abstract": "Phase separation is an important mechanism that mediates the spatial distribution of proteins in different cellular compartments. While phase-separated proteins share certain sequence characteristics, including intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and prion-like domains, such characteristics are insufficient for making accurate predictions; thus, a proteome-wide understanding of phase separation is currently lacking. Here, we define phase-separated proteomes based on the systematic analysis of immunofluorescence images of 12\u00a0073 proteins in the Human Protein Atlas. The analysis of these proteins reveals that phase-separated candidate proteins exhibit higher IDR contents, higher mean net charge and lower hydropathy and prefer to bind to RNA. Kinases and transcription factors are also enriched among these candidate proteins. Strikingly, both phase-separated kinases and phase-separated transcription factors display significantly reduced substrate specificity. Our work provides the first global view of the phase-separated proteome and suggests that the spatial proximity resulting from phase separation reduces the requirement for motif specificity and expands the repertoire of substrates.

        "Abstract": "Cortical interneurons establish inhibitory microcircuits throughout the neocortex and their dysfunction has been implicated in epilepsy and neuropsychiatric diseases. Developmentally, interneurons migrate from a distal progenitor domain in order to populate the neocortex - a process that occurs at a slower rate in humans than in mice. In this study, we sought to identify factors that regulate the rate of interneuron maturation across the two species. Using embryonic mouse development as a model system, we found that the process of initiating interneuron migration is regulated by blood vessels of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), an interneuron progenitor domain. We identified two endothelial cell-derived paracrine factors, SPARC and SerpinE1, that enhance interneuron migration in mouse MGE explants and organotypic cultures. Moreover, pre-treatment of human stem cell-derived interneurons (hSC-interneurons) with SPARC and SerpinE1 prior to transplantation into neonatal mouse cortex enhanced their migration and morphological elaboration in the host cortex. Further, SPARC and SerpinE1-treated hSC-interneurons also exhibited more mature electrophysiological characteristics compared to controls. Overall, our studies suggest a critical role for CNS vasculature in regulating interneuron developmental maturation in both mice and humans.",

        "Abstract": "The neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by deficiency in the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Currently approved SMA treatments aim to restore SMN, but the potential for SMN expression beyond physiological levels is a unique feature of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)-SMN gene therapy. Here, we show that long-term AAV9-mediated SMN overexpression in mouse models induces dose-dependent, late-onset motor dysfunction associated with loss of proprioceptive synapses and neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, aggregation of overexpressed SMN in the cytoplasm of motor circuit neurons sequesters components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, leading to splicing dysregulation and widespread transcriptome abnormalities with prominent signatures of neuroinflammation and the innate immune response. Thus, long-term SMN overexpression interferes with RNA regulation and triggers SMA-like pathogenic events through toxic gain-of-function mechanisms. These unanticipated, SMN-dependent and neuron-specific liabilities warrant caution on the long-term safety of treating individuals with SMA with AAV9-SMN and the risks of uncontrolled protein expression by gene therapy.",

        "Abstract": "The enormous cellular diversity in the mammalian brain, which is highly prototypical and organized in a hierarchical manner, is dictated by cell-type-specific gene-regulatory programs at the molecular level. Although prevalent in the brain, the contribution of alternative splicing (AS) to the molecular diversity across neuronal cell types is just starting to emerge. Here, we systematically investigated AS regulation across over 100 transcriptomically defined neuronal types of the adult mouse cortex using deep single-cell RNA-sequencing data. We found distinct splicing programs between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons and between subclasses within each neuronal class. These programs consist of overlapping sets of alternative exons showing differential splicing at multiple hierarchical levels. Using an integrative approach, our analysis suggests that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) Celf1/2, Mbnl2, and Khdrbs3 are preferentially expressed and more active in glutamatergic neurons, while Elavl2 and Qk are preferentially expressed and more active in GABAergic neurons. Importantly, these and additional RBPs also contribute to differential splicing between neuronal subclasses at multiple hierarchical levels, and some RBPs contribute to splicing dynamics that do not conform to the hierarchical structure defined by the transcriptional profiles. Thus, our results suggest graded regulation of AS across neuronal cell types, which may provide a molecular mechanism to specify neuronal identity and function that are orthogonal to established classifications based on transcriptional regulation.",

        "Abstract": "Chemotherapy is one of conventional treatment methods for breast cancer, but drug toxicity and side effects have severely limited its clinical applications. Photothermal therapy has emerged as a promising method that, upon combination with chemotherapy, can better treat breast cancer. In this context, a biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticle (bMSN NPs) system was developed for loading doxorubicin (DOX) and IR780, to be potentially applied in the treatment of breast cancer. IR780 is encapsulated in the pores of bMSN NPs by hydrophobic adsorption, while DOX is adsorbed on the surface of the bMSN NPs by hyaluronic acid electrostatically, to form the bMID NPs. Transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence spectrum and UV absorption spectrum are used to prove the successful encapsulation of IR780 and the loading of DOX. In vitro experiments have shown bMID NPs present an excellent therapeutic effect on breast cancer cells. In vivo fluorescence imaging results have indicated that bMID NPs can accumulate in tumor sites gradually and achieve in vivo long-term circulation and continuous drug release. Furthermore, bMID NPs have provided obvious antitumor effects in breast cancer mouse models, thus evolving as an efficient platform for breast cancer therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Coal and gas outbursts are among the most severe disasters threatening the safety of coal mines around the world. They are dynamic phenomena characterized by large quantities of coal and gas ejected from working faces within a short time. Numerous researchers have conducted studies on outburst prediction, and a variety of indices have been developed to this end. However, these indices are usually empirical or based on local experience, and the accurate prediction of outbursts is not feasible due to the complicated mechanisms of outbursts. This study conducts outburst experiments using large-scale multifunctional equipment developed in the laboratory to develop a more robust outburst prediction method. In this study, the coal temperature during the outburst process was monitored using temperature sensors. The results show that the coal temperature decreased rapidly as the outburst progressed. Meanwhile, the coal temperature in locations far from the outburst mouth increased. The coal broken in the stress concentration state is the main factor causing the abnormal temperature rise. The discovery of these phenomena lays a theoretical foundation and provides an experimental basis for an effective outburst prediction method. An outburst prediction method based on monitoring temperature was proposed, and has a simpler and faster operation process and is not easily disturbed by coal mining activities. What is more, the critical values of coal temperature rises or temperature gradients can be flexibly adjusted according to the actual situations of different coal mines to predict outbursts more effectively and accurately.",

Alternative splicing regulates the prototypical synaptic organizing complex, neuroligin-neurexin. In contrast to the well-studied neuroligin splice site B, little is known about splice site A. We discovered that inclusion of the positively charged A1 insert in mouse neuroligin-1 increases its binding to heparan sulphate, a modification on neurexin. The A1 insert increases neurexin recruitment, presynaptic differentiation, and synaptic transmission mediated by neuroligin-1. We propose that the A1 insert could be a target for alleviating the consequences of deleterious ",

        "Abstract": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by recognizing short and degenerate sequence motifs in their target transcripts, but precisely defining their binding specificity remains challenging. Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) allows for mapping of the exact protein-RNA crosslink sites, which frequently reside at specific positions in RBP motifs at single-nucleotide resolution. Here, we have developed a computational method, named mCross, to jointly model RBP\u00a0binding specificity while precisely registering the crosslinking position in motif sites. We applied mCross to 112 RBPs using ENCODE eCLIP data and validated the reliability of the discovered motifs by genome-wide analysis of allelic binding sites. Our analyses revealed that the prototypical SR protein SRSF1 recognizes clusters of GGA half-sites in addition to its canonical GGAGGA motif. Therefore, SRSF1 regulates splicing of a much larger repertoire of transcripts than previously appreciated, including HNRNPD and HNRNPDL, which are involved in multivalent protein assemblies and phase separation.",

Using molecular genetic approaches in mice of either sex, we identified 24 transcripts that have not previously been associated with a proprioceptor identity. Combinatorial expression analyses of these markers reveal at least three molecularly distinct proprioceptor subtypes. In addition, we find that 12 of these transcripts are expressed well after proprioceptors innervate their respective sensory receptors, and expression of three of these markers, including the heart development molecule ",

        "Abstract": "The RNA binding protein DAZL is essential for gametogenesis, but its direct in\u00a0vivo functions, RNA targets, and the molecular basis for germ cell loss in\u00a0Dazl-null mice are unknown. Here, we mapped transcriptome-wide DAZL-RNA interactions in\u00a0vivo, revealing DAZL binding to thousands of mRNAs via\u00a0polyA-proximal 3' UTR interactions. In parallel, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and RNA-seq identified mRNAs sensitive to DAZL deletion in male germ cells. Despite binding a broad set of mRNAs, integrative analyses indicate that DAZL post-transcriptionally controls only a subset of its mRNA targets, namely those corresponding to a network of genes that are critical for germ cell proliferation and survival. In addition, we provide evidence that polyA sequences have key roles in specifying DAZL-RNA interactions across the transcriptome. Our results reveal a mechanism for DAZL-RNA binding and illustrate that DAZL functions as a master regulator of a\u00a0post-transcriptional mRNA program essential for germ cell survival.",

        "Abstract": "LIN28 is a bipartite RNA-binding protein that post-transcriptionally inhibits the biogenesis of let-7 microRNAs to regulate development and influence disease states. However, the mechanisms of let-7 suppression remain poorly understood because LIN28 recognition depends on coordinated targeting by both the zinc knuckle domain (ZKD), which binds a GGAG-like element in the precursor, and the cold shock domain (CSD), whose binding sites have not been systematically characterized. By leveraging single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of LIN28 binding sites in\u00a0vivo, we determined that the CSD recognizes a (U)GAU motif. This motif partitions the let-7 microRNAs into two subclasses, precursors with both CSD and ZKD binding sites (CSD",

        "Abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) is one crucial step of gene expression that must be tightly regulated during neurodevelopment. However, the precise timing of developmental splicing switches and the underlying regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we systematically analyze the temporal regulation of AS in a large number of transcriptome profiles of developing mouse cortices, in vivo purified neuronal subtypes, and neurons differentiated in vitro. Our analysis reveals early-switch and late-switch exons in genes with distinct functions, and these switches accurately define neuronal maturation stages. Integrative modeling suggests that these switches are under direct and combinatorial regulation by distinct sets of neuronal RNA-binding proteins including Nova, Rbfox, Mbnl, and Ptbp. Surprisingly, various neuronal subtypes in the sensory systems lack Nova and/or Rbfox expression. These neurons retain the \"immature\" splicing program in early-switch exons, affecting numerous synaptic genes. These results provide new insights into the organization and regulation of the neurodevelopmental transcriptome.",

        "Title": "Systematic reconstruction of autism biology from massive genetic mutation profiles.",
        "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1% of world population and has become a pressing medical and social problem worldwide. As a paradigmatic complex genetic disease, ASD has been intensively studied and thousands of gene mutations have been reported. Because these mutations rarely recur, it is difficult to (i) pinpoint the fewer disease-causing versus majority random events and (ii) replicate or verify independent studies. A coherent and systematic understanding of autism biology has not been achieved. We analyzed 3392 and 4792 autism-related mutations from two large-scale whole-exome studies across multiple resolution levels, that is, variants (single-nucleotide), genes (protein-coding unit), and pathways (molecular module). These mutations do not recur or replicate at the variant level, but significantly and increasingly do so at gene and pathway levels. Genetic association reveals a novel gene + pathway dual-hit model, where the mutation burden becomes less relevant. In multiple independent analyses, hundreds of variants or genes repeatedly converge to several canonical pathways, either novel or literature-supported. These pathways define recurrent and systematic ASD biology, distinct from previously reported gene groups or networks. They also present a catalog of novel ASD risk factors including 118 variants and 72 genes. At a subpathway level, most variants disrupt the pathway-related gene functions, and in the same gene, they tend to hit residues extremely close to each other and in the same domain. Multiple interacting variants spotlight key modules, including the cAMP (adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate) second-messenger system and mGluR (metabotropic glutamate receptor) signaling regulation by GRKs (G protein-coupled receptor kinases). At a superpathway level, distinct pathways further interconnect and converge to three biology themes: synaptic function, morphology, and plasticity.",

This approach, named capture of the newly transcribed RNA interactome using click chemistry (RICK), systematically captures proteins bound to a wide range of RNAs, including nascent RNAs and traditionally neglected nonpolyadenylated RNAs. RICK has identified mitotic regulators amongst other novel RNA-binding proteins with preferential affinity for nonpolyadenylated RNAs, revealed a link between metabolic enzymes/factors and nascent RNAs, and expanded the known RNA-bound proteome of mouse embryonic stem cells. RICK will facilitate an in-depth interrogation of the total RNA-bound proteome in different cells and systems.",

        "Abstract": "Neuronal maturation requires dramatic morphological and functional changes, but the molecular mechanisms governing this process are not well understood. Here, we studied the role of Rbfox1, Rbfox2, and Rbfox3 proteins, a family of tissue-specific splicing regulators mutated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. We generated Rbfox triple knockout (tKO) ventral spinal neurons to define a comprehensive network of alternative exons under Rbfox regulation and to investigate their functional importance in the\u00a0developing neurons. Rbfox tKO neurons exhibit defects in alternative splicing of many cytoskeletal, membrane, and synaptic proteins, and display immature electrophysiological activity. The axon initial segment (AIS), a subcellular structure important for action potential initiation, is diminished upon Rbfox depletion. We identified an Rbfox-regulated splicing switch in ankyrin G, the AIS \"interaction hub\" protein, that regulates ankyrin G-beta spectrin affinity and AIS assembly. Our data show that the Rbfox-regulated splicing program plays a crucial role in structural and functional maturation of postmitotic neurons.",

        "Abstract": "The importance of RNA splicing in numerous cellular processes is well established. However, an underappreciated aspect is the ability of the spliceosome to recognize a set of very small (3-30 nucleotide, 1-10 amino acid) exons named microexons. Despite their small size, microexons and their regulation through alternative splicing have now been shown to play critical roles in protein and system function. Here we review the discovery of microexons over time and the mechanisms by which their splicing is regulated, including recent progress made through deep RNA sequencing. We also discuss the functional role of microexons in biology and disease.

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have identified many genes with rare de novo mutations in autism, but a limited number of these have been conclusively established as disease-susceptibility genes due to the lack of recurrence and confounding background mutations. Such extreme genetic heterogeneity severely limits recurrence-based statistical power even in studies with a large sample size. Here, we use cell-type specific expression profiles to differentiate mutations in autism patients from those in unaffected siblings. We report a gene expression signature in different neuronal cell types shared by genes with likely gene-disrupting (LGD) mutations in autism cases. This signature reflects haploinsufficiency of risk genes enriched in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators, with the strongest positive associations with specific types of neurons in different brain regions, including cortical neurons, cerebellar granule cells, and striatal medium spiny neurons. When used to prioritize genes with a single LGD mutation in cases, a D-score derived from the signature achieved a precision of 40% as compared with the 15% baseline with a minimal loss in sensitivity. An ensemble model combining D-score with mutation intolerance metrics from Exome Aggregation Consortium further improved the precision to 60%, resulting in 117 high-priority candidates. These prioritized lists can facilitate identification of additional autism-susceptibility genes.",

However, their binding sites have until recently been difficult to determine due to the apparent low specificity of RBPs for their target transcripts and the lack of high-throughput assays for analyzing binding sites genome wide. Here we present a bioinformatics method for predicting RBP binding motif sites on a genome-wide scale that leverages motif conservation, RNA secondary structure, and the tendency of RBP binding sites to cluster together. A probabilistic model is learned from bona fide binding sites determined by CLIP and applied genome wide to generate high specificity binding site predictions.",

        "Abstract": "For some neurological disorders, disease is primarily RNA mediated due to expression of non-coding microsatellite expansion RNAs (RNA(exp)). Toxicity is thought to result from enhanced binding of proteins to these expansions and depletion from their normal cellular targets. However, experimental evidence for this sequestration model is lacking. Here, we use HITS-CLIP and pre-mRNA processing analysis of human control versus myotonic dystrophy (DM) brains to provide compelling evidence for this RNA toxicity model. MBNL2 binds directly to DM repeat expansions in the brain, resulting in depletion from its normal RNA targets with downstream effects on alternative splicing and polyadenylation. Similar RNA processing defects were detected in Mbnl compound-knockout mice, highlighted by dysregulation of Mapt splicing and fetal tau isoform expression in adults. These results demonstrate that MBNL proteins are directly sequestered by RNA(exp) in the DM brain and introduce a powerful experimental tool to evaluate RNA-mediated toxicity in other expansion diseases.",

        "Abstract": "The volume of RNA-Seq data sets in public repositories has been expanding exponentially, providing unprecedented opportunities to study gene expression regulation. Because degraded RNA samples, such as those collected from post-mortem tissues, can result in distinct expression profiles with potential biases, a particularly important step in mining these data is quality control. Here we develop a method named mRIN to directly assess mRNA integrity from RNA-Seq data at the sample and individual gene level. We systematically analyse large-scale RNA-Seq data sets of the human brain transcriptome generated by different consortia. Our analysis demonstrates that 3' bias resulting from partial RNA fragmentation in post-mortem tissues has a marked impact on global expression profiles, and that mRIN effectively identifies samples with different levels of mRNA degradation. Unexpectedly, this process has a reproducible and gene-specific component, and transcripts with different stabilities are associated with distinct functions and structural features reminiscent of mRNA decay in living cells.",

        "Abstract": "New-emerging variants of Pseudorabies virus (PRV) compromise the protection provided by current vaccines and cause the death of all ages of vaccinated pigs since 2011. New vaccines based on current circulating PRV strain are needed to control the spread of disease since the variants are antigenically different from classical strains of virus. In this study, a TK/gE/gI triple gene-deleted PRV derived from current circulating field isolate was generated by using bacterial artificial chromosome techniques, and the rescued virus showed similar growth properties in vitro to its parent strain but reduced plaque size. To evaluate it as vaccine candidate, 9 day-old pigs were vaccinated and challenged with a virulent PRV variant. The results showed that vaccination can generate high level of protective gB-specific antibodies after vaccination and provide complete protection to the viral challenge. By contrast, the unvaccinated piglets all died within 6 days after viral challenge. Therefore, the TK/gE/gI triple gene-deleted PRV could be a promising vaccine candidate to control the wide spreading of PR variants in China.",

        "Title": "Systematic discovery of regulated and conserved alternative exons in the mammalian brain reveals NMD modulating chromatin regulators.",
        "Abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) dramatically expands the complexity of the mammalian brain transcriptome, but its atlas remains incomplete. Here we performed deep mRNA sequencing of mouse cortex to discover and characterize alternative exons with potential functional significance. Our analysis expands the list of AS events over 10-fold compared with previous annotations, demonstrating that 72% of multiexon genes express multiple splice variants in this single tissue. To evaluate functionality of the newly discovered AS events, we conducted comprehensive analyses on central nervous system (CNS) cell type-specific splicing, targets of tissue- or cell type-specific RNA binding proteins (RBPs), evolutionary selection pressure, and coupling of AS with nonsense-mediated decay (AS-NMD). We show that newly discovered events account for 23-42% of all cassette exons under tissue- or cell type-specific regulation. Furthermore, over 7,000 cassette exons are under evolutionary selection for regulated AS in mammals, 70% of which are new. Among these are 3,058 highly conserved cassette exons, including 1,014 NMD exons that may function directly to control gene expression levels. These NMD exons are particularly enriched in RBPs including splicing factors and interestingly also regulators for other steps of RNA metabolism. Unexpectedly, a second group of NMD exons reside in genes encoding chromatin regulators. Although the conservation of NMD exons in RBPs frequently extends into lower vertebrates, NMD exons in chromatin regulators are introduced later into the mammalian lineage, implying the emergence of a novel mechanism coupling AS and epigenetics. Our results highlight previously uncharacterized complexity and evolution in the mammalian brain transcriptome.",

        "Abstract": "Inhibition of muscleblind-like (MBNL) activity due to sequestration by microsatellite expansion RNAs is a major pathogenic event in the RNA-mediated disease myotonic dystrophy (DM). Although MBNL1 and MBNL2 bind to nascent transcripts to regulate alternative splicing during muscle and brain development, another major binding site for the MBNL protein family is the 3' untranslated region of target RNAs. Here, we report that depletion of Mbnl proteins in mouse embryo fibroblasts leads to misregulation of thousands of alternative polyadenylation events. HITS-CLIP and minigene reporter analyses indicate that these polyadenylation switches are a direct consequence of MBNL binding to target RNAs. Misregulated alternative polyadenylation also occurs in skeletal muscle in a mouse polyCUG model and human DM, resulting in the persistence of neonatal polyadenylation patterns. These findings reveal an additional developmental function for MBNL proteins and demonstrate that DM is characterized by misregulation of pre-mRNA processing at multiple levels.",

        "Abstract": "The major cell classes of the brain differ in their developmental processes, metabolism, signaling, and function. To better understand the functions and interactions of the cell types that comprise these classes, we acutely purified representative populations of neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, newly formed oligodendrocytes, myelinating oligodendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, and pericytes from mouse cerebral cortex. We generated a transcriptome database for these eight cell types by RNA sequencing and used a sensitive algorithm to detect alternative splicing events in each cell type. Bioinformatic analyses identified thousands of new cell type-enriched genes and splicing isoforms that will provide novel markers for cell identification, tools for genetic manipulation, and insights into the biology of the brain. For example, our data provide clues as to how neurons and astrocytes differ in their ability to dynamically regulate glycolytic flux and lactate generation attributable to unique splicing of PKM2, the gene encoding the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. This dataset will provide a powerful new resource for understanding the development and function of the brain. To ensure the widespread distribution of these datasets, we have created a user-friendly website (http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html) that provides a platform for analyzing and comparing transciption and alternative splicing profiles for various cell classes in the brain.",

        "Abstract": "The RNA binding proteins Rbfox1/2/3 regulate alternative splicing in the nervous system, and disruption of Rbfox1 has been implicated in autism. However, comprehensive identification of functional Rbfox targets has been challenging. Here, we perform HITS-CLIP for all three Rbfox family members in order to globally map, at a single-nucleotide resolution, their in\u00a0vivo RNA interaction sites in the mouse brain. We find that the two guanines in the Rbfox binding motif UGCAUG are critical for protein-RNA interactions and crosslinking. Using integrative modeling, these interaction sites, combined with additional datasets, define 1,059 direct Rbfox target\u00a0alternative splicing events. Over half of the quantifiable targets show dynamic changes during brain development. Of particular interest are 111 events from 48 candidate autism-susceptibility genes, including syndromic autism genes Shank3, Cacna1c, and Tsc2. Alteration of Rbfox targets in some autistic brains is correlated with downregulation of all three Rbfox proteins, supporting the potential clinical relevance of the splicing-regulatory network.",

        "Abstract": "The identification of sites where RNA-binding proteins (RNABPs) interact with target RNAs opens the door to understanding the vast complexity of RNA regulation. UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) is a transformative technology in which RNAs purified from in vivo cross-linked RNA-protein complexes are sequenced to reveal footprints of RNABP:RNA contacts. CLIP combined with high-throughput sequencing (HITS-CLIP) is a generalizable strategy to produce transcriptome-wide maps of RNA binding with higher accuracy and resolution than standard RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) profiling or purely computational approaches. The application of CLIP to Argonaute proteins has expanded the utility of this approach to mapping binding sites for microRNAs and other small regulatory RNAs. Finally, recent advances in data analysis take advantage of cross-link-induced mutation sites (CIMS) to refine RNA-binding maps to single-nucleotide resolution. Once IP conditions are established, HITS-CLIP takes \u223c8 d to prepare RNA for sequencing. Established pipelines for data analysis, including those for CIMS, take 3-4 d.",

        "Abstract": "Sequence-specific interactions of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with their target transcripts are essential for post-transcriptional gene expression regulation in mammals. However, accurate prediction of RBP motif sites has been difficult because many RBPs recognize short and degenerate sequences. Here we describe a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based algorithm mCarts to predict clustered functional RBP-binding sites by effectively integrating the number and spacing of individual motif sites, their accessibility in local RNA secondary structures and cross-species conservation. This algorithm learns and quantifies rules of these features, taking advantage of a large number of in vivo RBP-binding sites obtained from cross-linking and immunoprecipitation data. We applied this algorithm to study two representative RBP families, Nova and Mbnl, which regulate tissue-specific alternative splicing through interacting with clustered YCAY and YGCY elements, respectively, and predicted their binding sites in the mouse transcriptome. Despite the low information content in individual motif elements, our algorithm made specific predictions for successful experimental validation. Analysis of predicted sites also revealed cases of extensive and distal RBP-binding sites important for splicing regulation. This algorithm can be readily applied to other RBPs to infer their RNA-regulatory networks. The software is freely available at http://zhanglab.c2b2.columbia.edu/index.php/MCarts.",

        "Abstract": "The muscleblind-like (MBNL) genes encode alternative splicing factors that are essential for the postnatal development of multiple tissues, and the inhibition of MBNL activity by toxic C(C)UG repeat RNAs is a major pathogenic feature of the neuromuscular disease myotonic dystrophy. While MBNL1 controls fetal-to-adult splicing transitions in muscle and MBNL2 serves a similar role in the brain, the function of MBNL3 in vivo is unknown. Here, we report that mouse Mbnl3, which encodes protein isoforms that differ in the number of tandem zinc-finger RNA-binding motifs and subcellular localization, is expressed primarily during embryonic development but also transiently during injury-induced adult skeletal muscle regeneration. Mbnl3 expression is required for normal C2C12 myogenic differentiation and high-throughput sequencing combined with cross-linking/immunoprecipitation analysis indicates that Mbnl3 binds preferentially to the 3' untranslated regions of genes implicated in cell growth and proliferation. In addition, Mbnl3\u0394E2 isoform knockout mice, which fail to express the major Mbnl3 nuclear isoform, show age-dependent delays in injury-induced muscle regeneration and impaired muscle function. These results suggest that Mbnl3 inhibition by toxic RNA expression may be a contributing factor to the progressive skeletal muscle weakness and wasting characteristic of myotonic dystrophy.",

        "Abstract": "A crucial step in analyzing mRNA-Seq data is to accurately and efficiently map hundreds of millions of reads to the reference genome and exon junctions. Here we present OLego, an algorithm specifically designed for de novo mapping of spliced mRNA-Seq reads. OLego adopts a multiple-seed-and-extend scheme, and does not rely on a separate external aligner. It achieves high sensitivity of junction detection by strategic searches with small seeds (~14 nt for mammalian genomes). To improve accuracy and resolve ambiguous mapping at junctions, OLego uses a built-in statistical model to score exon junctions by splice-site strength and intron size. Burrows-Wheeler transform is used in multiple steps of the algorithm to efficiently map seeds, locate junctions and identify small exons. OLego is implemented in C++ with fully multithreaded execution, and allows fast processing of large-scale data. We systematically evaluated the performance of OLego in comparison with published tools using both simulated and real data. OLego demonstrated better sensitivity, higher or comparable accuracy and substantially improved speed. OLego also identified hundreds of novel micro-exons (<30 nt) in the mouse transcriptome, many of which are phylogenetically conserved and can be validated experimentally in vivo. OLego is freely available at http://zhanglab.c2b2.columbia.edu/index.php/OLego.",

        "Abstract": "The neuronal RNA binding protein NOVA regulates splicing, shuttles to the cytoplasm, and co-localizes with target transcripts in dendrites, suggesting links between splicing and local translation. Here we identified >200 transcripts showing NOVA-dependent changes in abundance, but, surprisingly, HITS-CLIP revealed NOVA binds these RNAs in introns rather than 3' UTRs. This led us to discover NOVA-regulated splicing of cryptic exons within these introns. These exons triggered nonsense mediated decay (NMD), as UPF1 and protein synthesis were required for NOVA's effect on RNA levels. Their regulation was dynamic and physiologically relevant. The NMD exons were regulated by seizures, which also induced changes in Nova subcellular localization and mediated large changes in synaptic proteins, including proteins implicated in familial epilepsy. Moreover, Nova haploinsufficient mice had spontaneous epilepsy. The data reveal a hidden means of dynamic RNA regulation linking electrical activity to splicing and protein output, and of mediating homeostatic excitation/inhibition balance in neurons.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00178.001.",

        "Abstract": "The paraneoplastic neurologic disorders target several families of neuron-specific RNA binding proteins (RNABPs), revealing that there are unique aspects of gene expression regulation in the mammalian brain. Here, we used HITS-CLIP to determine robust binding sites targeted by the neuronal Elav-like (nElavl) RNABPs. Surprisingly, nElav protein binds preferentially to GU-rich sequences in vivo and in vitro, with secondary binding to AU-rich sequences. nElavl null mice were used to validate the consequence of these binding events in the brain, demonstrating that they bind intronic sequences in a position dependent manner to regulate alternative splicing and to 3'UTR sequences to regulate mRNA levels. These controls converge on the glutamate synthesis pathway in neurons; nElavl proteins are required to maintain neurotransmitter glutamate levels, and the lack of nElavl leads to spontaneous epileptic seizure activity. The genome-wide analysis of nElavl targets reveals that one function of neuron-specific RNABPs is to control excitation-inhibition balance in the brain.",

        "Abstract": "The RNA-mediated disease model for myotonic dystrophy (DM) proposes that microsatellite C(C)TG expansions express toxic RNAs that disrupt splicing regulation by altering MBNL1 and CELF1 activities. While this model explains DM manifestations in muscle, less is known about the effects of C(C)UG expression on the brain. Here, we report that Mbnl2 knockout mice develop several DM-associated central nervous system (CNS) features including abnormal REM sleep propensity and deficits in spatial memory. Mbnl2 is prominently expressed in the hippocampus and Mbnl2 knockouts show a decrease in NMDA receptor (NMDAR) synaptic transmission and impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity. While Mbnl2 loss did not significantly alter target transcript levels in the hippocampus, misregulated splicing of hundreds of exons was detected using splicing microarrays, RNA-seq, and HITS-CLIP. Importantly, the majority of the Mbnl2-regulated exons examined were similarly misregulated in DM. We propose that major pathological features of the DM brain result from disruption of the MBNL2-mediated developmental splicing program.",

        "Abstract": "Genome-wide studies have identified thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) lacking protein-coding capacity. However, most lncRNAs are expressed at a very low level, and in most cases there is no genetic evidence to support their in vivo function. Malat1 (metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) is among the most abundant and highly conserved lncRNAs, and it exhibits an uncommon 3'-end processing mechanism. In addition, its specific nuclear localization, developmental regulation, and dysregulation in cancer are suggestive of it having a critical biological function. We have characterized a Malat1 loss-of-function genetic model that indicates that Malat1 is not essential for mouse pre- and postnatal development. Furthermore, depletion of Malat1 does not affect global gene expression, splicing factor level and phosphorylation status, or alternative pre-mRNA splicing. However, among a small number of genes that were dysregulated in adult Malat1 knockout mice, many were Malat1 neighboring genes, thus indicating a potential cis-regulatory role of Malat1 gene transcription.",

        "Abstract": "Two polypyrimidine tract RNA-binding proteins (PTBs), one near-ubiquitously expressed (Ptbp1) and another highly tissue-restricted (Ptbp2), regulate RNA in interrelated but incompletely understood ways. Ptbp1, a splicing regulator, is replaced in the brain and differentiated neuronal cell lines by Ptbp2. To define the roles of Ptbp2 in the nervous system, we generated two independent Ptbp2-null strains, unexpectedly revealing that Ptbp2 is expressed in neuronal progenitors and is essential for postnatal survival. A HITS-CLIP (high-throughput sequencing cross-linking immunoprecipitation)-generated map of reproducible Ptbp2-RNA interactions in the developing mouse neocortex, combined with results from splicing-sensitive microarrays, demonstrated that the major action of Ptbp2 is to inhibit adult-specific alternative exons by binding pyrimidine-rich sequences upstream of and/or within them. These regulated exons are present in mRNAs encoding proteins associated with control of cell fate, proliferation, and the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting a role for Ptbp2 in neurogenesis. Indeed, neuronal progenitors in the Ptbp2-null brain exhibited an aberrant polarity and were associated with regions of premature neurogenesis and reduced progenitor pools. Thus, Ptbp2 inhibition of a discrete set of adult neuronal exons underlies early brain development prior to neuronal differentiation and is essential for postnatal survival.",

        "Abstract": "Androgens drive the onset and progression of prostate cancer (PCa) by modulating androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity. Although several microarray-based studies have identified androgen-regulated genes, here we identify in-parallel global androgen-dependent changes in both gene and alternative mRNA isoform expression by exon-level analyses of the LNCaP transcriptome. While genome-wide gene expression changes correlated well with previously-published studies, we additionally uncovered a subset of 226 novel androgen-regulated genes. Gene expression pathway analysis of this subset revealed gene clusters associated with, and including the tyrosine kinase LYN, as well as components of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, which is commonly dysregulated in cancer. We also identified 1279 putative androgen-regulated alternative events, of which 325 (\u223c25%) mapped to known alternative splicing events or alternative first/last exons. We selected 30 androgen-dependent alternative events for RT-PCR validation, including mRNAs derived from genes encoding tumour suppressors and cell cycle regulators. Of seven positively-validating events (\u223c23%), five events involved transcripts derived from alternative promoters of known AR gene targets. In particular, we found a novel androgen-dependent mRNA isoform derived from an alternative internal promoter within the TSC2 tumour suppressor gene, which is predicted to encode a protein lacking an interaction domain required for mTOR inhibition. We confirmed that expression of this alternative TSC2 mRNA isoform was directly regulated by androgens, and chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated recruitment of AR to the alternative promoter region at early timepoints following androgen stimulation, which correlated with expression of alternative transcripts. Together, our data suggest that alternative mRNA isoform expression might mediate the cellular response to androgens, and may have roles in clinical PCa.",

        "Abstract": "Understanding how silent genes can be competent for activation provides insight into development as well as cellular reprogramming and pathogenesis. We performed genomic location analysis of the pioneer transcription factor FoxA in the adult mouse liver and found that about one-third of the FoxA bound sites are near silent genes, including genes without detectable RNA polymerase II. Virtually all of the FoxA-bound silent sites are within conserved sequences, suggesting possible function. Such sites are enriched in motifs for transcriptional repressors, including for Rfx1 and type II nuclear hormone receptors. We found one such target site at a cryptic \"shadow\" enhancer 7 kilobases (kb) downstream of the Cdx2 gene, where Rfx1 restricts transcriptional activation by FoxA. The Cdx2 shadow enhancer exhibits a subset of regulatory properties of the upstream Cdx2 promoter region. While Cdx2 is ectopically induced in the early metaplastic condition of Barrett's esophagus, its expression is not necessarily present in progressive Barrett's with dysplasia or adenocarcinoma. By contrast, we find that Rfx1 expression in the esophageal epithelium becomes gradually extinguished during progression to cancer, i.e, expression of Rfx1 decreased markedly in dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. We propose that this decreased expression of Rfx1 could be an indicator of progression from Barrett's esophagus to adenocarcinoma and that similar analyses of other transcription factors bound to silent genes can reveal unanticipated regulatory insights into oncogenic progression and cellular reprogramming.",

        "Abstract": "FMRP loss of function causes Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autistic features. FMRP is a polyribosome-associated neuronal RNA-binding protein, suggesting that it plays a key role in regulating neuronal translation, but there has been little consensus regarding either its RNA targets or mechanism of action. Here, we use high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) to identify FMRP interactions with mouse brain polyribosomal mRNAs. FMRP interacts with the coding region of transcripts encoding pre- and postsynaptic proteins and transcripts implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We developed a brain polyribosome-programmed translation system, revealing that FMRP reversibly stalls ribosomes specifically on its target mRNAs. Our results suggest that loss of a translational brake on the synthesis of a subset of synaptic proteins contributes to FXS. In addition, they provide insight into the molecular basis of the cognitive and allied defects in FXS and ASD and suggest multiple targets for clinical intervention.",

        "Abstract": "Mammalian RNA complexity is regulated through interactions of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with their target transcripts. High-throughput sequencing together with UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) is able to globally map RBP-binding footprint regions at a resolution of ~30-60 nucleotides. Here we describe a systematic way to analyze HITS-CLIP data to identify exact crosslink sites, and thereby determine protein-RNA interactions at single-nucleotide resolution. We found that reverse transcriptase used in CLIP frequently skips the crosslinked amino-acid-RNA adduct, resulting in a nucleotide deletion. Genome-wide analysis of these crosslinking-induced mutation sites (CIMS) in HITS-CLIP data for Nova and Argonaute (Ago) proteins in mouse brain tissue revealed deletions in ~8-20% of mRNA tags, which mapped to Nova and Ago binding sites on mRNA or miRNA. CIMS analysis provides a general and more precise means of mapping protein-RNA interactions than currently available methods and insight into the biochemical properties of such interactions in living tissues.",

        "Abstract": "The control of RNA alternative splicing is critical for generating biological diversity. Despite emerging genome-wide technologies to study RNA complexity, reliable and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks have not been defined. Here, we used Bayesian networks to probabilistically model diverse data sets and predict the target networks of specific regulators. We applied this strategy to identify approximately 700 alternative splicing events directly regulated by the neuron-specific factor Nova in the mouse brain, integrating RNA-binding data, splicing microarray data, Nova-binding motifs, and evolutionary signatures. The resulting integrative network revealed combinatorial regulation by Nova and the neuronal splicing factor Fox, interplay between phosphorylation and splicing, and potential links to neurologic disease. Thus, we have developed a general approach to understanding mammalian RNA regulation at the systems level.",

However, cancer-associated mutations are almost exclusively found in RB, implying that RB has a nonredundant role in tumor suppression. We demonstrate that RB preferentially associates with E2F target genes involved in DNA replication and is uniquely required to repress these genes during senescence but not other growth states. Consequently, RB loss leads to inappropriate DNA synthesis following a senescence trigger and, together with disruption of a p21-mediated cell-cycle checkpoint, enables extensive proliferation and rampant genomic instability. Our results identify a nonredundant RB effector function that may contribute to tumor suppression and reveal how loss of RB and p53 cooperate to bypass senescence.",

        "Abstract": "Alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing influences development, physiology and disease, but its regulation in humans is not well understood, partially because of the limited scale at which the expression of specific splicing events has been measured. We generated the first genome-scale expression compendium of human alternative splicing events using custom whole-transcript microarrays monitoring expression of 24,426 alternative splicing events in 48 diverse human samples. Over 11,700 genes and 9,500 splicing events were differentially expressed, providing a rich resource for studying splicing regulation. An unbiased, systematic screen of 21,760 4-mer to 7-mer words for cis-regulatory motifs identified 143 RNA 'words' enriched near regulated cassette exons, including six clusters of motifs represented by UCUCU, UGCAUG, UGCU, UGUGU, UUUU and AGGG, which map to trans-acting regulators PTB, Fox, Muscleblind, CELF/CUG-BP, TIA-1 and hnRNP F/H, respectively. Each cluster showed a distinct pattern of genomic location and tissue specificity. For example, UCUCU occurs 110 to 35 nucleotides preceding cassette exons upregulated in brain and striated muscle but depleted in other tissues. UCUCU and UGCAUG seem to have similar function but independent action, occurring 5' and 3', respectively, of 33% of the cassette exons upregulated in skeletal muscle but co-occurring for only 2%.",

However, the molecular basis of tissue-specific AS regulation and the properties of splicing regulatory networks (SRNs) are poorly understood. Here we comprehensively predict the targets of the brain- and muscle-specific splicing factor Fox-1 (A2BP1) and its paralog Fox-2 (RBM9) and systematically define the corresponding SRNs genome-wide. Fox-1/2 are conserved from worm to human, and specifically recognize the RNA element UGCAUG. We integrate Fox-1/2-binding specificity with phylogenetic conservation, splicing microarray data, and additional computational and experimental characterization. We predict thousands of Fox-1/2 targets with conserved binding sites, at a false discovery rate (FDR) of approximately 24%, including many validated experimentally, suggesting a surprisingly extensive SRN. The preferred position of the binding sites differs according to AS pattern, and determines either activation or repression of exon recognition by Fox-1/2. Many predicted targets are important for neuromuscular functions, and have been implicated in several genetic diseases. We also identified instances of binding site creation or loss in different vertebrate lineages and human populations, which likely reflect fine-tuning of gene expression regulation during evolution.",

        "Abstract": "A novel drug carrier for brain delivery, poly(ethyleneglycol)-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PEG-PCL) polymersomes conjugated with mouse-anti-rat monoclonal antibody OX26 (OX26-PO), was developed and its brain delivery property was evaluated. The diblock copolymers of methoxy-PEG-PCL and Maleimide-PEG-PCL were synthesized and applied to prepare polymersomes (PO) which were verified by direct cryogenic temperature transmission electron micrograph (Cryo-TEM) imaging. The TEM examination and dynamic light scattering results showed that OX26-PO had a round and vesicle-like shape with a mean diameter around 100 nm. Coupling of OX26 with PO was confirmed by immuno-gold labeling of OX26 visualized under the TEM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy test. The surface OX26 densities were obtained from enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. The result of brain delivery in rats proved that the increase of surface OX26 density of OX26-PO decreased blood AUC. The optimized OX26 number conjugated per polymersome was 34, which can acquire the greatest blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability surface area product and percentage of injected dose per gram brain (%ID/g brain). Furthermore, NC-1900, as a model peptide, was encapsulated into OX26(34)-PO and improved the scopolamine-induced learning and memory impairments in a water maze task via i.v. administration. These results indicated that OX26(34)-PO is a promising carrier for peptide brain delivery.",

        "Title": "RNA landscape of evolution for optimal exon and intron discrimination.",
        "Abstract": "Accurate pre-mRNA splicing requires primary splicing signals, including the splice sites, a polypyrimidine tract, and a branch site, other splicing-regulatory elements (SREs). The SREs include exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs), exonic splicing silencers (ESSs), intronic splicing enhancers (ISEs), and intronic splicing silencers (ISSs), which are typically located near the splice sites. However, it is unclear to what extent splicing-driven selective pressure constrains exonic and intronic sequences, especially those distant from the splice sites. Here, we studied the distribution of SREs in human genes in terms of DNA strand-asymmetry patterns. Under a neutral evolution model, each mononucleotide or oligonucleotide should have a symmetric (Chargaff's second parity rule), or weakly asymmetric yet uniform, distribution throughout a pre-mRNA transcript. However, we found that large sets of unbiased, experimentally determined SREs show a distinct strand-asymmetry pattern that is inconsistent with the neutral evolution model, and reflects their functional roles in splicing. ESEs are selected in exons and depleted in introns and vice versa for ESSs. Surprisingly, this trend extends into deep intronic sequences, accounting for one third of the genome. Selection is detectable even at the mononucleotide level, so that the asymmetric base compositions of exons and introns are predictive of ESEs and ESSs. We developed a method that effectively predicts SREs based on strand asymmetry, expanding the current catalog of SREs. Our results suggest that human genes have been optimized for exon and intron discrimination through an RNA landscape shaped during evolution.",

        "Abstract": "As a result of large-scale sequencing projects and recent splicing-microarray studies, estimates of mammalian genes expressing multiple transcripts continue to increase. This expansion of transcript information makes it possible to better characterize alternative splicing events and gain insights into splicing mechanisms and regulation. Here, we describe a class of splice sites that we call dual-specificity splice sites, which we identified through genome-wide, high-quality alignment of mRNA/EST and genome sequences and experimentally verified by RT-PCR. These splice sites can be alternatively recognized as either 5' or 3' splice sites, and the dual splicing is conceptually similar to a pair of mutually exclusive exons separated by a zero-length intron. The dual-splice-site sequences are essentially a composite of canonical 5' and 3' splice-site consensus sequences, with a CAG|GURAG core. The relative use of a dual site as a 5' or 3' splice site can be accurately predicted by assuming competition for specific binding between spliceosomal components involved in recognition of 5' and 3' splice sites, respectively. Dual-specificity splice sites exist in human and mouse, and possibly in other vertebrate species, although most sites are not conserved, suggesting that their origin is recent. We discuss the implications of this unusual splicing pattern for the diverse mechanisms of exon recognition and for gene evolution.",

Evaluating the statistical significance of the gene ranking is important for understanding the results and for further biological investigations, but this question has not been well addressed for machine learning methods in existing works. Here, we address this problem by formulating it in the framework of hypothesis testing and propose a solution based on resampling. The proposed r-test methods convert gene ranking results into position p-values to evaluate the significance of genes. The methods are tested on three real microarray data sets and three simulation data sets with support vector machines as the method of classification and gene selection. The obtained position p-values help to determine the number of genes to be selected and enable scientists to analyze selection results by sophisticated multivariate methods under the same statistical inference paradigm as for simple hypothesis testing methods.",

        "Abstract": "Numerous disease-associated point mutations exert their effects by disrupting the activity of exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). We previously derived position weight matrices to predict putative ESEs specific for four human SR proteins. The score matrices are part of ESEfinder, an online resource to identify ESEs in query sequences. We have now carried out a refined functional SELEX screen for motifs that can act as ESEs in response to the human SR protein SF2/ASF. The test BRCA1 exon under selection was internal, rather than the 3'-terminal IGHM exon used in our earlier studies. A naturally occurring heptameric ESE in BRCA1 exon 18 was replaced with two libraries of random sequences, one seven nucleotides in length, the other 14. Following three rounds of selection for in vitro splicing via internal exon inclusion, new consensus motifs and score matrices were derived. Many winner sequences were demonstrated to be functional ESEs in S100-extract-complementation assays with recombinant SF2/ASF. Motif-score threshold values were derived from both experimental and statistical analyses. Motif scores were shown to correlate with levels of exon inclusion, both in vitro and in vivo. Our results confirm and extend our earlier data, as many of the same motifs are recognized as ESEs by both the original and our new score matrix, despite the different context used for selection. Finally, we have derived an increased specificity score matrix that incorporates information from both of our SF2/ASF-specific matrices and that accurately predicts the exon-skipping phenotypes of deleterious point mutations.",

        "Title": "A clustering property of highly-degenerate transcription factor binding sites in the mammalian genome.",
        "Abstract": "Transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) are short DNA sequences interacting with transcription factors (TFs), which regulate gene expression. Due to the relatively short length of such binding sites, it is largely unclear how the specificity of protein-DNA interaction is achieved. Here, we have performed a genome-wide analysis of TFBS-like sequences for the transcriptional repressor, RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor (REST), as well as for several other representative mammalian TFs (c-myc, p53, HNF-1 and CREB). We find a nonrandom distribution of inexact sites for these TFs, referred to as highly-degenerate TFBSs, that are enriched around the cognate binding sites. Comparisons among human, mouse and rat orthologous promoters reveal that these highly-degenerate sites are conserved significantly more than expected by random chance, suggesting their positive selection during evolution. We propose that this arrangement provides a favorable genomic landscape for functional target site selection.",

        "Abstract": "Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer illness and death among men in the United States and world wide. There is an urgent need to discover good biomarkers for early clinical diagnosis and treatment. Previously, we developed an exon-junction microarray-based assay and profiled 1532 mRNA splice isoforms from 364 potential prostate cancer related genes in 38 prostate tissues. Here, we investigate the advantage of using splice isoforms, which couple transcriptional and splicing regulation, for cancer classification.",
