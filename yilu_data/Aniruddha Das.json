        "Abstract": "Later-life cognitive function is strongly influenced by one's environment. At this life stage, a partner's behaviors and attributes-including their own cognitive status-are a key environmental determinant. A recent \"social allostasis\" theory also yields specific predictions on patterns of mutual influence-or \"contagion\"-in cognitive function. Yet, no population representative studies have examined these coupled dynamics. Using recently developed fixed-effects cross-lagged panel modeling (FE-CLPM) methods and ten-year data from the Health and Retirement Study-nationally-representative of U.S. adults over 50-the current study filled this gap. Results supported dyadic cognitive contagion over the long- but not short-run. Short-term associations suggested intriguing \"cognitive cycling\" possibilities among both men and women that need further investigation. Overall, results supported a theoretical model of coupled \"cognitive careers,\" and relational inducement of allostatic load. Especially among men, recurrent impulses also cumulatively induced substantial path-dependent cognitive improvements, supporting the added value of repeated over one-time interventions. Theoretical and substantive implications are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "The pre-existing theory of pre-mRNA splicing into linear mature RNA was questioned with the introduction of circular RNAs (circRNAs). Hundreds of studies using high throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques and novel computational programs reported the abundant and ubiquitous expression of circRNAs originating by pre-mRNA backsplicing. CircRNAs are mostly involved in gene expression by regulating functions of interacting microRNAs (miRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) or translating into functional polypeptides. Although all circRNA annotation tools identify circRNAs based on the backsplice junction (BSJ) sequences, only a few identify the internal sequences of circRNAs. However, the full-length sequence of circRNAs from RNA-seq data could be error-prone due to its similarity with the counterpart linear RNA. Since circRNA function depends on the mature sequence, validation of the mature sequence is the prerequisite for their further characterization. In this chapter, we discuss the validation of circRNA BSJ sequence by RT-PCR using divergent primer followed by Sanger sequencing. Furthermore, we describe the circRNA-rolling circle amplification (circRNA-RCA; circRNA enrichment by RNase R treatment, full-length cDNA synthesis, rolling circle PCR amplification using full-length primers, and Sanger sequencing of the PCR product) to validate the mature splice sequence of circRNAs. This chapter highlights the basic guidelines for designing divergent and full-length primers for PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing to validate circRNA sequences.",

        "Abstract": "Current methods for recording large-scale neuronal activity from behaving mice at single-cell resolution require either fixing the mouse head under a microscope or attachment of a recording device to the animal's skull. Both of these options significantly affect the animal behavior and hence also the recorded brain activity patterns. Here, we introduce a different method to acquire snapshots of single-cell cortical activity maps from freely-moving mice using a calcium sensor called CaMPARI. CaMPARI has a unique property of irreversibly changing its color from green to red inside active neurons when illuminated with 400\u2009nm light. We capitalize on this property to demonstrate cortex-wide activity recording without any head fixation, tethering, or attachment of a miniaturized device to the mouse's head. Multiple cortical regions were recorded while the mouse was performing a battery of behavioral and cognitive tests. We identified task-dependent activity patterns across motor and somatosensory cortices, with significant differences across sub-regions of the motor cortex and correlations across several activity patterns and task parameters. This CaMPARI-based recording method expands the capabilities of recording neuronal activity from freely-moving and behaving mice under minimally-restrictive experimental conditions and provides large-scale volumetric data that are currently not accessible otherwise.",

        "Abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA molecules generated from precursor RNAs by the head-to-tail backsplicing of exons. Hundreds of studies demonstrated that circRNAs are ubiquitously expressed and regulate cellular events by modulating microRNA (miRNA) and RNA-binding protein (RBP) activities. A few circRNAs are also known to translate into functional polypeptides regulating cellular physiology. All these functions primarily depend on the full-length sequence of the circRNAs. CircRNA backsplice junction sequence is the key to identifying circRNAs and their full-length mature sequence. However, some multi-exonic circRNAs exist in different isoforms sharing identical backsplice junction sequences and are termed circRNA splice variants. Here, we analyzed the previously published HeLa cell RNA-seq datasets to identify circRNA splice variants using the de novo module of the CIRCexplorer2 circRNA annotation pipeline. A subset of circRNAs with splice variants was validated by the circRNA-rolling circle amplification (circRNA-RCA) method. Interestingly, several validated circRNAs were predicted to translate into proteins by the riboCIRC database. Furthermore, polyribosome fractionation followed by quantitative PCR confirmed the association of a subset of circRNAs with polyribosome supporting their protein-coding potential. Finally, bioinformatics analysis of proteins derived from splice variants of circCORO1C and circASPH suggested altered protein sequences and structures that could affect their physiological functions. Together, our study identified novel circRNA splice variants and their potential translation into protein isoforms which may regulate various physiological processes.",

        "Abstract": "CHIP (C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) and its worm ortholog CHN-1 are E3 ubiquitin ligases that link the chaperone system with the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). CHN-1 can cooperate with UFD-2, another E3 ligase, to accelerate ubiquitin chain formation; however, the basis for the high processivity of this E3s set has remained obscure. Here, we studied the molecular mechanism and function of the CHN-1-UFD-2 complex in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our data show that UFD-2 binding promotes the cooperation between CHN-1 and ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzymes by stabilizing the CHN-1 U-box dimer. However, HSP70/HSP-1 chaperone outcompetes UFD-2 for CHN-1 binding, thereby promoting a shift to the autoinhibited CHN-1 state by acting on a conserved residue in its U-box domain. The interaction with UFD-2 enables CHN-1 to efficiently ubiquitylate and regulate S-adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY-1), a key enzyme in the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) regeneration cycle, which is essential for SAM-dependent methylation. Our results define the molecular mechanism underlying the synergistic cooperation of CHN-1 and UFD-2 in substrate ubiquitylation.",

Although RNA-seq has identified more than a million circRNAs, only a handful of them is validated with other techniques, including northern blotting, gel-trap electrophoresis, exonuclease treatment assays, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Reverse transcription (RT) of total RNA followed by PCR amplification is the most widely used technique for validating circRNAs identified in RNA-seq. RT-PCR is a highly reproducible, sensitive, and quantitative method for the detection and quantitation of circRNAs. This chapter details the basic guidelines for designing suitable primers for PCR amplification and validation of circRNAs .",

        "Abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of disability in the Western world. Current post-stroke rehabilitation treatments are only effective in approximately half of the patients. Therefore, there is a pressing clinical need for developing new rehabilitation approaches for enhancing the recovery process, which requires the use of appropriate animal models. Here, we demonstrate the use of nonlinear microscopy of calcium sensors in the rat brain to study the effects of ischemic stroke injury on cortical activity patterns. We longitudinally recorded from thousands of neurons labeled with a genetically-encoded calcium indicator before and after an ischemic stroke injury in the primary motor cortex. We show that this injury has an effect on the activity patterns of neurons not only in the motor and somatosensory cortices, but also in the more distant visual cortex, and that these changes include modified firing rates and kinetics of neuronal activity patterns in response to a sensory stimulus. Changes in neuronal population activity provided animal-specific, circuit-level information on the post-stroke cortical reorganization process, which may be essential for evaluating the efficacy of new approaches for enhancing the recovery process.",

Several computational tools have been developed to predict circRNA interaction with target miRNAs and RBPs with a view to studying their potential effect on downstream target genes and cellular physiology. Biochemical assays, including reporter assays, AGO2 pulldown, ribonucleoprotein pulldown, and biotin-labeled RNA pulldown, are used to capture the association of miRNAs and RBPs with circRNAs.

The power of the methodology was further extended to the synthesis of substituted chromene and thiochromene derivatives in high yields. In addition, substituted quinoline derivatives were also achieved in a single step in the presence of FeCl3 through detosylation/aromatisation. A number of control experiments have been performed and a plausible mechanism has also been proposed to explain the formation of the products.",

        "Abstract": "Fluctuations in blood oxygenation and flow are widely used to infer brain activity during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, there are strong systemic and vascular contributions to resting-state signals that are unrelated to ongoing neural activity. Importantly, these non-neural contributions to haemodynamic signals (or 'rude mechanicals') can be as large as or larger than the neurally evoked components. Here, we review the two broad classes of drivers of these signals. One is systemic and is tied to fluctuations in external drivers such as heart rate and breathing, and the robust autoregulatory mechanisms that try to maintain a constant milieu in the brain. The other class comprises local, active fluctuations that appear to be intrinsic to vascular tissue and are likely similar to active local fluctuations seen in vasculature all over the body. In this review, we describe these non-neural fluctuations and some of the tools developed to correct for them when interpreting fMRI recordings. However, we also emphasize the links between these vascular fluctuations and brain physiology and point to ways in which fMRI measurements can be used to exploit such links to gain valuable information about neurovascular health and about internal brain states. This article is part of the theme issue 'Key relationships between non-invasive functional neuroimaging and the underlying neuronal activity'.",

        "Abstract": "A 3D metal-organic framework (MOF) called Al-DUT-5-N2H3 (1) (DUT: Dresden University of Technology) was prepared hydrothermally using Al(iii) salt and a hydrazinyl functionalized linker called 2-hydrazinyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid (BPDC-N2H3). Material 1 was successfully characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), FT-IR spectroscopy, N2 sorption (BET) experiment, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), EDX and FE-SEM analyses. The activated form of material 1 (called 1') was achieved by a direct heating process. Material 1' was successfully employed for the solution-phase fluorescence detection of \u03b1-ketoglutaric acid (\u03b1-KG). It showed high detection performance even when there were other competitive analytes present in the mixture. Material 1' is the first MOF-based fluorescent turn-off sensor for the detection of \u03b1-KG. The response time for \u03b1-KG is exceptionally low (60 s) as compared to any other reported \u03b1-KG sensor. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 0.61 \u03bcM, which is far better as compared to any other reported sensor for \u03b1-KG to date. The mechanism for \u03b1-KG sensing was thoroughly investigated and proposed to be PET (photoinduced electron transfer) process by TD-DFT (time-dependent DFT) calculations.",

        "Abstract": "Advancement in the RNA sequencing techniques has discovered hundreds of thousands of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in humans. However, the physiological function of most of the identified circRNAs remains unexplored. Recent studies have established that spliceosomal machinery and RNA-binding proteins modulate circRNA biogenesis. Furthermore, circRNAs have been implicated in regulating crucial cellular processes by interacting with various proteins and microRNAs. However, there are several challenges in understanding the mechanism of circRNA biogenesis, transport, and their interaction with cellular factors to regulate cellular events because of their low abundance and sequence similarity with linear RNA. Addressing these challenges requires systematic studies that directly visualize the circRNAs in cells at single-molecule resolution along with the molecular regulators. In this review, we present the design, benefits, and weaknesses of RNA imaging techniques such as single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and BaseScope in fixed cells and fluorescent RNA aptamers in live-cell imaging of circRNAs. Furthermore, we propose the potential use of molecular beacons, multiply labeled tetravalent RNA imaging probes, and Cas-derived systems to visualize circRNAs.",

        "Abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large family of noncoding RNAs that have emerged as novel regulators of gene expression. However, little is known about the function of circRNAs in pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Here, transcriptomic analysis of mice pancreatic islet RNA-sequencing data identified 77 differentially expressed circRNAs between mice fed with a normal diet and a high-fat diet. Surprisingly, multiple circRNAs were derived from the intron 2 of the preproinsulin 2 (",

        "Abstract": "Histones modulate gene expression by chromatin compaction, regulating numerous processes such as differentiation. However, the mechanisms underlying histone degradation remain elusive. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have a unique chromatin architecture characterized by low levels of trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3), a heterochromatin-associated modification. Here we assess the link between the intrinsic epigenetic landscape and ubiquitin-proteasome system of hESCs. We find that hESCs exhibit high expression of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2K. Loss of UBE2K upregulates the trimethyltransferase SETDB1, resulting in H3K9 trimethylation and repression of neurogenic genes during differentiation. Besides H3K9 trimethylation, UBE2K binds histone H3 to induce its polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Notably, ubc-20, the worm orthologue of UBE2K, also regulates histone H3 levels and H3K9 trimethylation in Caenorhabditis elegans germ cells. Thus, our results indicate that UBE2K crosses evolutionary boundaries to promote histone H3 degradation and reduce H3K9me3 repressive marks in immortal cells.",

Cycles of demyelination, followed by remyelination, appear in the majority of MS patients and are associated with the onset and quiescence of disease-related symptoms, respectively. Previous studies in human patients and animal models have shown that vast demyelination is accompanied by wide-scale changes to brain activity, but details of this process are poorly understood. We used electrophysiological recordings and non-linear fluorescence imaging from genetically encoded calcium indicators to monitor the activity of hippocampal neurons during demyelination and remyelination over a period of 100 days. We found that synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons was diminished ",

        "Abstract": "In the present work, a new MOF material of the UiO-family called Zr-UiO-66-NH-CH2-Py (1) has been obtained by the solvothermal technique and successfully characterized. The MOF structure was assembled with 2-((pyridin-4-ylmethyl) amino) terephthalic acid (H2BDC-NH-CH2-Py) as linker and Zr4+ ion. The activated form of 1 (called 1') exhibits considerable thermal and chemical stability. Compound 1' showed a very rapid and selective response for the fluorometric sensing of superoxide (O2\u00b7-) in aqueous medium even in the presence of the potentially competitive reactive oxygen species (ROS). The limit of detection value for O2\u00b7- sensing is 0.21 \u03bcM, which is comparable with those of the reported O2\u00b7- sensors. This is the first MOF based fluorescent sensor for the detection of O2\u00b7-. The response time of this MOF sensor for O2\u00b7- is very short (240 s). On the other hand, 1' was employed as a solid heterogeneous catalyst for Knoevenagel condensation between benzaldehyde and ethyl cyanoacetate at 80 \u00b0C in ethanol resulting in a very high yield of the desired product. The effects of the esterified linker ((CH3)2BDC-NH-CH2-Py) and the corresponding metal salt (ZrCl4) on this catalytic reaction were examined separately. We have also tested the substrate scope elaborately for the catalytic reaction promoted by catalyst 1'.",

        "Abstract": "High-throughput RNA sequencing and novel bioinformatic pipelines have identified thousands of circular (circ)RNAs containing backsplice junction sequences. However, circRNAs generated from multiple exons may contain different combinations of exons and/or introns arising from alternative splicing, while the backsplice junction sequence is the same. To be able to identify circRNA splice variants, we developed a method termed circRNA-Rolling Circle Amplification (circRNA-RCA). This method detects full-length circRNA sequences by performing reverse transcription (RT) in the absence of RNase H activity, followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of full-length circRNAs using a forward primer spanning the backsplice junction sequence and a reverse primer exactly upstream of the forward primer. By sequencing the PCR products, circRNA splice variants bearing the same backsplice junctions, which were otherwise only predicted computationally, could be experimentally validated. The splice variants were further predicted to associate with different subsets of target RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs, supporting the notion that different circRNA splice variants can have different biological impacts. In sum, the circRNA-RCA method allows the accurate identification of full-length circRNA sequences, offering unique insight into their individual function.",

        "Abstract": "Hemodynamic recordings from visual cortex contain powerful endogenous task-related responses that may reflect task-related arousal, or \"task engagement\" distinct from attention. We tested this hypothesis with hemodynamic measurements (intrinsic-signal optical imaging) from monkey primary visual cortex (V1) while the animals' engagement in a periodic fixation task over several hours was varied through reward size and as animals took breaks. With higher rewards, animals appeared more task-engaged; task-related responses were more temporally precise at the task period (approximately 10-20 seconds) and modestly stronger. The 2-5 minute blocks of high-reward trials led to ramp-like decreases in mean local blood volume; these reversed with ramp-like increases during low reward. The blood volume increased even more sharply when the animal shut his eyes and disengaged completely from the task (5-10 minutes). We propose a mechanism that controls vascular tone, likely along with local neural responses in a manner that reflects task engagement over the full range of timescales tested.",

The process of skeletal muscle regeneration is called myogenesis, which starts with activation of quiescent satellite cells immediately after muscle injury followed by proliferation and fusion of myoblasts into myotubes. Myogenesis is orchestrated through the expression of a specific set of genes which, at each step regulated by complex gene regulatory networks. Besides the well-established roles of transcription factors, increasing evidence demonstrated that circular (circ)RNAs modulate gene expression during myogenesis and are involved in muscle-related diseases. Here we review the recent findings of circRNAs involved in myogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Herein, we present the successful synthesis, characterization and sensing application of a hydrazine functionalized Zr(iv)-based UiO-66 metal-organic framework (MOF) called Zr-UiO-66-N2H3 (1). The guest-free material 1' shows selective and sensitive fluorimetric detection (turn-on mechanism) of phosphate (PO43-) anions in HEPES buffer (10 mM, pH = 7.4) and aqueous medium. It can also fluorimetrically detect (turn-off mechanism) 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-NB) in a HEPES\u2009:\u2009DMSO (9\u2009:\u20091, v/v) medium with high selectivity and sensitivity. The selectivity for both analytes is retained in the presence of other potentially competitive analytes. The detection limit for PO43- ions is 0.196 \u03bcM, which is far below the PO43- level present in the aqueous environment. MOF 1' can detect intracellular phosphate and it also has the capacity to exhibit differences in the intracellular phosphate level. Furthermore, the probe is capable of sensing PO43- ions in real samples such as tap water, lake water, human urine and human blood serum. The sensitivity of the probe for sensing 4-NB is very high (detection limit = 4.7 \u03bcM). The possible mechanisms for sensing PO43- ions and 4-NB have been explored in detail by experimental techniques.",

        "Abstract": "Recent developments in high-throughput RNA sequencing methods coupled with innovative bioinformatic tools have uncovered thousands of circular (circ)RNAs. CircRNAs have emerged as a vast and novel class of regulatory RNAs with potential to modulate gene expression by acting as sponges for microRNAs (miRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). The biochemical enrichment of circRNAs by exoribonuclease treatment or by depletion of polyadenylated RNAs coupled with deep-sequencing is widely used for the systematic identification of circRNAs. Although these methods enrich circRNAs substantially, they do not eliminate efficiently non-polyadenylated and highly-structured RNAs. Here, we describe a method we termed RPAD, based on initial RNase R treatment followed by Polyadenylation and poly(A)",

        "Abstract": "Marking functionally distinct neuronal ensembles with high spatiotemporal resolution is a key challenge in systems neuroscience. We recently introduced CaMPARI, an engineered fluorescent protein whose green-to-red photoconversion depends on simultaneous light exposure and elevated calcium, which enabled marking active neuronal populations with single-cell and subsecond resolution. However, CaMPARI (CaMPARI1) has several drawbacks, including background photoconversion in low calcium, slow kinetics and reduced fluorescence after chemical fixation. In this work, we develop CaMPARI2, an improved sensor with brighter green and red fluorescence, faster calcium unbinding kinetics and decreased photoconversion in low calcium conditions. We demonstrate the improved performance of CaMPARI2 in mammalian neurons and in vivo in larval zebrafish brain and mouse visual cortex. Additionally, we herein develop an immunohistochemical detection method for specific labeling of the photoconverted red form of CaMPARI. The anti-CaMPARI-red antibody provides strong labeling that is selective for photoconverted CaMPARI in activated neurons in rodent brain tissue.",

        "Abstract": "Despite accumulating small-sample and clinical evidence on \"inflammaging,\" no population-representative longitudinal studies have specifically examined women's late-life inflammation trends. While a range of studies indicates estradiol's immunomodulation role, evidence is contradictory on whether its effects are pro- or antiinflammatory among older women. Using longitudinal data from the first two waves of the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project-a national probability sample of older U.S. adults aged 57 to 85\u00a0years at baseline-this study began to fill these gaps. Findings suggested rather than being a lifelong process, older women's inflammaging may have a biological window that closes with senescence. Moreover, their endogenous estradiol plays a proinflammatory rather than immunoprotective role. Nor does this sex steroid modulate age effects on women's inflammation. More sex-specific basic research is needed on causal mechanisms underlying women's late-life inflammaging patterns.",

        "Abstract": "Fear conditioning, a behavioral model for studying fear-related\u00a0disorders, is believed to be formed by alterations of synaptic efficacy mediated by changes in synaptic transmission and neuronal morphology in lateral amygdala (LA). Rac GTPase and its downstream effector p21-activated kinase (PAK) are involved in such key neuronal functions. Here we show that optical activation of Rac1 GTPase using photoactivatable form of Rac1 (PA-Rac1) in amygdala led to phosphorylation of PAK and inhibition of long-term but not short-term auditory fear conditioning memory formation. Activation of PA-Rac1 in LA one day after fear conditioning had no effect on long-term fear memory tested 24 hrs after PA-Rac1 activation. Inhibition of PAK in LA by microinjection of the PAK inhibitor IPA-3 30\u2009minutes before fear conditioning enhanced long-term but not short-term fear memory formation. Our results demonstrate that photoactivation of Rac1 GTPase in lateral amygdala impairs fear memory formation. Moreover, Rac1 effector PAK activity during fear conditioning constrains the formation of fear memory in LA. Thus, Rac GTPase and PAK proteins may serve as targets for treatment of fear and anxiety disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Task-related hemodynamic responses contribute prominently to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings. They reflect behaviorally important brain states, such as arousal and attention, and can dominate stimulus-evoked responses, yet they remain poorly understood. To help characterize these responses, we present a method for parametrically estimating both stimulus-evoked and task-related components of hemodynamic responses from subjects engaged in temporally predictable tasks. The stimulus-evoked component is modeled by convolving a hemodynamic response function (HRF) kernel with spiking. The task-related component is modeled by convolving a Fourier-series task-related function (TRF) kernel with task timing. We fit this model with simultaneous electrode recordings and intrinsic-signal optical imaging from the primary visual cortex of alert, task-engaged monkeys. With high [Formula: see text], the model returns HRFs that are consistent across experiments and recording sites for a given animal and TRFs that entrain to task timing independent of stimulation or local spiking. When the task schedule conflicts with that of stimulation, the TRF remains locked to the task emphasizing its behavioral origins. The current approach is strikingly more robust to fluctuations than earlier ones and gives consistently, if modestly, better fits. This approach could help parse the distinct components of fMRI recordings made in the context of a task.",

        "Abstract": "This nationally representative study queried effects of community dwelling older adults' depression and inflammation at baseline on over-time changes in surrogate markers of their cardiometabolic risk. Data were from the 2005-2006 and 2010-2011 waves of the U.S. National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project. Inflammation was indicated by C-reactive protein and depression by the CES-D scale. Cardiometabolic markers included hemoglobin A1c and systolic BP. Lagged dependent variable models were used to examine effects. In none of the models did Wave 1 depression predict residual change in cardiometabolic states (i.e., Wave 2 values net of Wave 1). In contrast, men's baseline C-reactive protein predicted their Wave 2 hemoglobin A1c (Coeff.\u00a0=\u00a00.02, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) as well as their systolic BP (Coeff.\u00a0=\u00a03.22, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). No such effects were found among women. Contrary to a growing clinical literature, depression may not increase cardiometabolic risk among older adults on average. Moderators that may interact with depression to yield such effects in delimited samples remain to be identified. Inflammation, in contrast, does seem linked to increase in physiological risk-but only among men, not women. Clinical research is needed to identify biological factors responsible for this sex difference.",

For both genders, our autoregressive effects indicated a large amount of temporal stability, not just in individual-level attributes (T, masturbation) but also dyadic ones (partnered sex, relationship quality)-indicating that a need for more nuanced theories of relational processes. Cross-lagged results suggested gender-specific effects-generally more consistent with sexual or relational modulation of T than with hormonal causation. Specifically, men's findings indicated their T might be elevated by their sexual (masturbatory) activity but not vice versa, although androgen levels did lower men's subsequent relationship quality. Women's T, in contrast, was negatively influenced not just by their higher relationship quality but also by their more frequent partnered sex-perhaps reflecting a changing function of sexual activity in late life.",

Results suggest the majority of late-life partnerships (N = 854) may not have a heavy burden of sexual difficulties. However, almost a fifth (18.21%) of partnered older women do not abstain from sex despite low sexual motivation and capacity. This relational \"type\" seems unlinked to demographic or health attributes, and may be driven more by partnership strains. In addition, an \"at risk\" group with consistent sexual problems, arguably due to age-related decline, comprises 27.16% of all late-life couples.",

        "Abstract": "Using data from the 2010 to 2011 wave of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project-a nationally representative probability sample of older U.S. adults-this study queried distinctive linkages of mild and of severe childhood sexual contact with lifetime sexual and psychological outcomes among women and men aged 60-99\u00a0years (N\u00a0=\u00a03283). In addition, we examined stratification of these associations by sexual revictimization (forced sex and/or harassment). Among women, sequelae of childhood contact seemed consistently negative for the mild rather than severe variant-but only in the co-presence of revictimization-a pattern that may have remained obscured in previous analysis of event effects. Men's results suggested lifelong eroticizing but not psychological effects of this early experience-with the co-presence of revictimization potentially enhancing rather than lowering their mental health. Overall, findings appeared to reflect gendered patterns of risk-with mild childhood contact potentially channeling women but not men into revictimization and finally to elevated sexuality and poor mental health in late life. Early sexual experiences should thus be conceptualized not as singular events, but as part of a lifelong career with regularities and rhythms that may influence their pathogenic potential.",

        "Abstract": "Angelman syndrome and autism are neurodevelopmental disorders linked to mutations and duplications of an E3 ligase called ube3a respectively. Since cognitive deficits and learning disabilities are hallmark symptoms of both these disorders, we investigated a role for dube3a in the learning ability of flies using the aversive phototaxis suppression assay. We show that down and up-regulation of dube3a are both detrimental to learning in larvae and adults. Using conditional gene expression we found that dube3a is required for normal brain development and during adulthood. Furthermore, we suggest that dube3a could be interacting with other learning and memory genes such as derailed. Along with firmly establishing dube3a as a gene that is required for learning, our work also opens avenues for further understanding the role played by this gene in brain development and behavior.",

        "Abstract": "The implicit goal of functional magnetic resonance imaging is to infer local neural activity. There is considerable debate, however, as to whether imaging correlates most linearly with local spiking or some local field potential (LFP) measurement. Through simultaneous neuroimaging (intrinsic-signal optical imaging) and electrode recordings from alert, task-engaged macaque monkeys, we showed previously that local electrophysiology correlates with only a specific stimulus-related imaging component. Here we show that this stimulus-related component--obtained by subtracting a substantial task-related component--is particularly linear with local spiking over a comprehensive range of response strengths. Matches to concurrent LFP measurements are, to varying degrees, poorer. As a control, we also tried matching the full imaging signal to local electrophysiology without subtracting task-related components. These control matches were consistently worse; they were, however, slightly better for gamma LFP than spiking, potentially resolving discrepancies between our findings and earlier reports favoring LFP.",

Results suggested that despite potentially more unequal gender roles, evangelical older women may have better marital quality, perhaps due to the recent transformation of their male counterparts into authoritative, yet-supportive, \"soft patriarchs.\" Correspondingly, these women, especially those with greater subjective religiosity or more support from a spouse, reported consistently better sexual outcomes than their counterparts in other religions. In addition, they also had lower estradiol, whether due to psychobiological effects of their better relationships or self-selection of those with differential hormone levels into particular partnership patterns. While older men in these communities also experienced more satisfactory marriages, and had lower androgens (testosterone, DHEA), their relational assets were less uniformly matched by better sexual outcomes, perhaps reflecting a gender disparity in the linkage between these factors.",

        "Abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by abnormal expansion of glutamine repeats in the protein huntingtin. In HD brain, mutant huntingtin undergoes proteolytic processing, and its N-terminal fragment containing poly-glutamine repeats accumulate as insoluble aggregates leading to the defect in cellular protein quality control system and heat shock response (HSR). Here we demonstrate that the defective HSR in the brain is due to the down-regulation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) in both mice and fly models of HD. Interestingly, treatment of dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) to HD mice or flies significantly increased the expression and transactivation of HSF1 and induction of HSR and these effects are mediated through the down-regulation of HSP90. Dexamethasone treatment also significantly decreased the aggregate load and transient recovery of HD-related behavioural phenotypes in both disease models. These results suggest that dexamethasone could be a potential therapeutic molecule for the treatment of HD and related poly-glutamine disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Using nationally representative data from the 2005-2006 U.S. National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, this study queried race differences in older men's polyamorous and casual sex, as well as stratification of these patterns by endogenous androgens (testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone) and by regular religious participation. Results suggested that despite their respective prominence in the biomedical and sociological literatures on sex, neither \"bottom up\" hormonal influences nor \"top down\" religious social control were major structuring factors for greater lifetime as well as current likelihood of these behaviors among older Black than White men. Androgens were higher among the former, but did not seem to drive these race patterns. Regular church attendance--while negatively associated with non-monogamous and prolific partnering, and hence possibly a social control mechanism among all men--played only a weak role in moderating ethnic variations in these behaviors. It is speculated that these differences may instead be driven by unexamined current or early factors, including, perhaps, Black men's greater exposure to sexualizing processes in adolescence that, even in late life, may outweigh more temporally-proximal influences.",

Results indicate that contrary to much of the academic literature as well as media accounts-implicitly rooted in a \"culture of irresponsibility\" model--older black men's social isolation, poor health behaviors, or obesity may not play a major role in their worse metabolic problems. Instead, these outcomes seem to derive more consistently from a factor almost unexamined in the literature--chronic inflammation, arguably a biological \"weathering\" mechanism induced by these men's cumulative and multi-dimensional stress. These findings highlight the necessity of focusing attention not simply on proximal behavioral interventions, but on broader stress-inducing social inequalities, to reduce men's race disparities in health.",

By simultaneously recording electrode and neuroimaging (intrinsic optical imaging) signals in alert, task-engaged macaque visual cortex, we recently observed a large anticipatory trial-related neuroimaging signal that was poorly related to local spiking or field potentials. We used these same techniques to study the interactions of this trial-related signal with stimulus-evoked responses over the full range of stimulus intensities, including total darkness. We found that the two signals could be separated, and added linearly over this full range. The stimulus-evoked component was related linearly to local spiking and, consequently, could be used to obtain precise and reliable estimates of local neural activity. The trial-related signal likely has a distinct neural mechanism, however, and failure to account for it properly could lead to substantial errors when estimating local neural spiking from the neuroimaging signal.",

        "Abstract": "There is growing evidence that functional brain images in alert task-engaged subjects contain task-related but stimulus-independent signals in addition to stimulus-evoked responses. It is important to separate these different components when analyzing the neuroimaging signal. Using intrinsic-signal optical imaging combined with electrophysiology we had earlier reported a particular 'trial-related signal' in the primary visual cortex (V1) of alert monkeys performing periodic fixation tasks. This signal periodically modulated V1 tissue blood volume, in time with anticipated trial onsets. Unlike visually evoked blood volume changes, however, this signal was present even in total darkness. Further, it could not be predicted by concurrently recorded spiking or local field potentials. Here we use our earlier recording techniques to analyze the spatial distribution of this trial-related signal over our imaged area (10mm square, subdivided into a 16\u00d716 grid, i.e. at 625 \u03bcm resolution). We show that the signal is spatially coherent and essentially homogeneous over the imaged region and fails to be predicted by concurrent electrode recordings even at the resolution of a single grid square at the electrode tip. As a corollary we show that the signal is critically linked to the animals' engagement in a task. Not only does the trial-related signal entrain accurately and precisely to any task timing at which the animal was willing to perform; the signal also loses the entrained trial-locked pattern dramatically, within a single trial, when the animal stops performing correctly. Thus the signal is very unlikely to be an ongoing task-independent vascular oscillation. These findings will help categorize the likely distinct varieties of non-stimulus-related signals evoked during behavioral tasks, and lead to a further understanding of the elements comprising the net neuroimaging response.",

        "Abstract": "As people age, many aspects of their lives tend to change, including the constellation of people with whom they are connected, their social context, their families, and their health--changes that are often interrelated. Wave I of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) has yielded rich information on intimate ties, especially dyads and families, and on social connections generally. Combined with extensive biological and other health measures, NSHAP enables researchers to address key questions on health and aging. We begin with recent findings on intimate dyads, then move to social participation, and finally to elder mistreatment. Among dyads, we find that whereas sexual activity drops sharply with age for both women and men, gender differences in partner loss as well as psychosocial and normative pressures constrain women's sex more than men's. However, surviving partnerships tend to be emotionally and physically satisfying and are marked by relatively frequent sex. In contrast to sex, nonsexual intimacy is highly prevalent at older ages, especially among women. Older adults are also socially resilient--adapting to the loss of social ties by increasing involvement with community and kin networks. Despite these social assets, older adults remain vulnerable to mistreatment. Overall, these findings yield a mixed picture of gender-differentiated vulnerabilities balanced by proactive adaptation and maintenance of social and dyadic assets.",

        "Abstract": "Flavoprotein fluorescence imaging (FFI) is a novel intrinsic optical signal that is steadily gaining ground as a valuable imaging tool in neuroscience research due to its closer relationship with local metabolism relative to the more commonly used hemodynamic signals. We have developed a technique for FFI imaging in the primary visual cortex (V1) of alert monkeys. Due to the nature of neurovascular coupling, hemodynamic signals are known to spread beyond the locus of metabolic activity. To determine whether FFI signals could provide a more focal measure of cortical activity in alert animals, we compared FFI and hemodynamic point spreads (i.e. responses to a minimal visual stimulus) and functional mapping signals over V1 in macaques performing simple fixation tasks. FFI responses were biphasic, with an early and focal fluorescence increase followed by a delayed and spatially broader fluorescence decrease. As expected, the early fluorescence increase, indicating increased local oxidative metabolism, was somewhat narrower than the simultaneously observed hemodynamic response. However, the later FFI decrease was broader than the hemodynamic response and started prior to the cessation of visual stimulation suggesting different mechanisms underlying the two phases of the fluorescence signal. FFI mapping signals were free of vascular artifacts and comparable in amplitude to hemodynamic mapping signals. These results indicate that the FFI response may be a more local and direct indicator of cortical metabolism than the hemodynamic response in alert animals.",

        "Abstract": "In functional brain imaging there is controversy over which hemodynamic signal best represents neural activity. Intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) suggests that the best signal is the early darkening observed at wavelengths absorbed preferentially by deoxyhemoglobin (HbR). It is assumed that this darkening or \"initial dip\" reports local conversion of oxyhemoglobin (HbO) to HbR, i.e., oxygen consumption caused by local neural activity, thus giving the most specific measure of such activity. The blood volume signal, by contrast, is believed to be more delayed and less specific. Here, we used multiwavelength ISOI to simultaneously map oxygenation and blood volume [i.e., total hemoglobin (HbT)] in primary visual cortex (V1) of the alert macaque. We found that the hemodynamic \"point spread,\" i.e., impulse response to a minimal visual stimulus, was as rapid and retinotopically specific when imaged by using blood volume as when using the initial dip. Quantitative separation of the imaged signal into HbR, HbO, and HbT showed, moreover, that the initial dip was dominated by a fast local increase in HbT, with no increase in HbR. We found only a delayed HbR decrease that was broader in retinotopic spread than HbO or HbT. Further, we show that the multiphasic time course of typical ISOI signals and the strength of the initial dip may reflect the temporal interplay of monophasic HbO, HbR, and HbT signals. Characterizing the hemodynamic response is important for understanding neurovascular coupling and elucidating the physiological basis of imaging techniques such as fMRI.",

        "Abstract": "Interactions in primary visual cortex (V1) between simple visual elements such as short bar segments are believed to underlie our ability to easily integrate contours and segment surfaces. We used intrinsic signal optical imaging in alert fixating macaques to measure the strength and cortical distribution of V1 interactions among collinear bars. A single short bar stimulus produced a broad-peaked hill of activation (the optical point spread) covering multiple orientation hypercolumns in V1. Flanking the bar stimulus with a pair of identical collinear bars led to a strong nonlinear suppression in the optical signal. This nonlinearity was strongest over the center bar region, with a spatial distribution that cannot be explained by a simple gain control. It was a function of the relative orientation and separation of the bar stimuli in a manner tuned sharply for collinearity, being strongest for immediately adjacent bars lying on a smooth contour. These results suggest intracortical interactions playing a major role in determining V1 activation by smooth extended contours. Our finding that the interaction is primarily suppressive when imaged optically, which presumably reflects the combined inhibitory and excitatory inputs, suggests a complex interplay between these cortical inputs leading to the collinear facilitation seen in the spiking response of V1 neurons. This disjuncture between the facilitation seen in spiking and the suppression in imaging also suggests that cortical representations of complex stimuli involve interactions that need to be studied over extended networks and may be hard to deduce from the responses of individual neurons.",

        "Abstract": "Haemodynamic signals underlying functional brain imaging (for example, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)) are assumed to reflect metabolic demand generated by local neuronal activity, with equal increases in haemodynamic signal implying equal increases in the underlying neuronal activity. Few studies have compared neuronal and haemodynamic signals in alert animals to test for this assumed correspondence. Here we present evidence that brings this assumption into question. Using a dual-wavelength optical imaging technique that independently measures cerebral blood volume and oxygenation, continuously, in alert behaving monkeys, we find two distinct components to the haemodynamic signal in the alert animals' primary visual cortex (V1). One component is reliably predictable from neuronal responses generated by visual input. The other component-of almost comparable strength-is a hitherto unknown signal that entrains to task structure independently of visual input or of standard neural predictors of haemodynamics. This latter component shows predictive timing, with increases of cerebral blood volume in anticipation of trial onsets even in darkness. This trial-locked haemodynamic signal could be due to an accompanying V1 arterial pumping mechanism, closely matched in time, with peaks of arterial dilation entrained to predicted trial onsets. These findings (tested in two animals) challenge the current understanding of the link between brain haemodynamics and local neuronal activity. They also suggest the existence of a novel preparatory mechanism in the brain that brings additional arterial blood to cortex in anticipation of expected tasks.",

        "Abstract": "Using nationally representative data from the 1992 U.S. National Health and Social Life Survey, this study queried the prevalence and risk factors of lifetime workplace sexual harassment among both women and men. Among those aged 18-60 reporting ever having worked, 41% of women (CI, 37-44) reported any workplace harassment over their lifetime, with men's harassment prevalence significantly lower, at 32% (CI, 29-35). In the youngest age groups (those in their 20s or younger), there was no statistically significant difference between women's and men's harassment prevalence. Multivariate analysis of risk factors suggested that, in contrast to much of the harassment literature, among both genders workplace harassment seemed to have at least as much to do with a system of \"routine activities\" mechanisms-a victim's conscious or unconscious sexual signaling, more exposure to potential harassers, and a perpetrator's lower cost of harassment-as with unobserved differences in power between victim and perpetrator. Strikingly, both women's and men's harassment was strongly linked to markers of sexualization, whether early developmental factors or behavioral patterns in adulthood-a mechanism insufficiently emphasized in the harassment literature.",

        "Abstract": "This study examined the prevalence and sources of masturbatory practice in a nationally representative sample from China completed in the year 2000, with analysis of sources focused on 2,828 urban respondents aged 20-59. In this subpopulation, 13% (95% CI, 10-18) of women and 35% (CI, 26-44) of men reported any masturbation in the preceding year. Prevalence for people in their 20s was higher, and closer to US and European levels, especially for men. Particularly for women, masturbation not only compensated for absent partners but also complemented the high sexual interests of a subset of participants. For both women and men, practicing masturbation appeared to be a two-step process. In the first step, events such as sexual contact in childhood, early puberty, and early sex were related to sexualization and the \"gateway event\" of adolescent masturbation. In the second step, other factors, such as liberal sexual values and sexual knowledge, further increased the current probability of masturbation. Overall, the results suggest that masturbation is readily adopted even at more modest levels of economic and social development, that masturbation is often more than simply compensatory behavior for regular partnered sex, that masturbatory patterns are heavily influenced by early sexualization, and that a complex model is needed to comprehend masturbatory practice, particularly for women.",

The system of factors underlying masturbation was similar for both genders, consistent with a convergence in gender patterns of sexual expression in the United States. Among both women and men, masturbation responded to a stable sexualized personality pattern, catalyzed by early-life factors and manifested in current sexual traits. Strikingly, the masturbation-partnered sex linkage, often conceptualized either as compensating for unsatisfying sex or complementing a satisfactory sex life, appeared to be bimodal for both genders. For some, masturbation complemented an active and pleasurable sex life, while among others, it compensated for a lack of partnered sex or satisfaction in sex.",

It was the first study to use a general population sample to examine all types of harassment in an Asian country. The dataset was a stratified probability sample with 3,821 participants, and was nationally representative (apart from Hong Kong and Tibet) of China's adult population aged 20-64. In total, 12.5% of all women and 15.1% of urban women reported some form of harassment in the past year. Among urban women age 20-45, most cross-sex harassment was not from supervisors or superiors (1.4%) but from coworkers and other peers (7.0%), strangers (4.6%), dates and boyfriends (3.6%), and others (2.6%). Multivariate analysis of risk factors for cross-sex harassment suggested that, despite its predominance in the Western literature on sexual harassment, the power differentials approach, focusing on male-female power differentials in patriarchal societies, was of modest utility. The results were more consistent with a more comprehensive routine activities approach borrowed from criminology, which emphasizes situational opportunity, perceived benefit to the harasser, and reduced costs for the harasser. The most striking result from the data represents the area receiving the least attention in the West, namely, the perpetrator's perception of \"benefit,\" deriving from the victim's inadvertent \"signaling.\"",

In a study of the effect of retinal lesions on adult primary visual cortex (V1), Smirnakis et al. propose that there is no cortical reorganization. Their results are based, however, on BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), which provides an unreliable gauge of spiking activity. We therefore question their criterion for lack of plasticity, particularly in the light of the large body of earlier work that demonstrates cortical plasticity.",

        "Abstract": "Primary visual cortex (V1) has remarkably systematic functional maps. One commonly used class of computational models proposes that such maps are generated by a mechanism that projects the multiple dimensions of neuronal responses smoothly onto the two dimensions of cortex. In this issue of Neuron, Mriganka Sur and colleagues find a close match between such model predictions and measurements from ferret V1.",

        "Abstract": "Two components of cortical circuits could mediate contour integration in primary visual cortex (V1): intrinsic horizontal connections and feedback from higher cortical areas. To distinguish between these, we combined functional mapping with a new technique for labeling axons, a recombinant adenovirus bearing the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP), to determine the extent, density, and orientation specificity of V1 intrinsic connections and V2 to V1 feedback. Both connections cover portions of V1 representing regions of visual space up to eight times larger than receptive fields as classically defined, though the intrinsic connections are an order of magnitude denser than the feedback. Whereas the intrinsic connections link similarly oriented domains in V1, V2 to V1 feedback displays no such specificity. These findings suggest that V1 intrinsic horizontal connections provide a more likely substrate for contour integration.",
