        "Abstract": "Tumors frequently harbor isogenic yet epigenetically distinct subpopulations of multi-potent cells with high tumor-initiating potential-often called Cancer Stem-Like Cells (CSLCs). These can display preferential resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapy. Single-cell analyses can help elucidate Master Regulator (MR) proteins responsible for governing the transcriptional state of these cells, thus revealing complementary dependencies that may be leveraged via combination therapy. Interrogation of single-cell RNA sequencing profiles from seven metastatic breast cancer patients, using perturbational profiles of clinically relevant drugs, identified drugs predicted to invert the activity of MR proteins governing the transcriptional state of chemoresistant CSLCs, which were then validated by CROP-seq assays. The top drug, the anthelmintic albendazole, depleted this subpopulation ",

        "Abstract": "Aberrant signaling pathway activity is a hallmark of tumorigenesis and progression, which has guided targeted inhibitor design for over 30 years. Yet, adaptive resistance mechanisms, induced by rapid, context-specific signaling network rewiring, continue to challenge therapeutic efficacy. Leveraging progress in proteomic technologies and network-based methodologies, we introduce Virtual Enrichment-based Signaling Protein-activity Analysis (VESPA)-an algorithm designed to elucidate mechanisms of cell response and adaptation to drug perturbations-and use it to analyze 7-point phosphoproteomic time series from colorectal cancer cells treated with clinically-relevant inhibitors and control media. Interrogating tumor-specific enzyme/substrate interactions accurately infers kinase and phosphatase activity, based on their substrate phosphorylation state, effectively accounting for signal crosstalk and sparse phosphoproteome coverage. The analysis elucidates time-dependent signaling pathway response to each drug perturbation and, more importantly, cell adaptive response and rewiring, experimentally confirmed by CRISPR knock-out assays, suggesting broad applicability to cancer and other diseases.",

Yet, drug activity and polypharmacology are increasingly associated with a broad range of off-target and tissue-specific effector proteins. To address this challenge, we have leveraged a microfluidics-based Plate-Seq technology to survey drug perturbational profiles representing >700 FDA-approved and experimental oncology drugs, in cell lines selected as high-fidelity models of 23 aggressive tumor subtypes. Built on this dataset, we implemented an efficient computational framework to define a tissue-specific protein activity landscape of these drugs and reported almost 50 million differential protein activities derived from drug perturbations ",

        "Abstract": "Due to their immunosuppressive role, tumor-infiltrating regulatory T\u00a0cells (TI-Tregs) represent attractive immuno-oncology targets. Analysis of TI vs. peripheral Tregs (P-Tregs) from 36 patients, across four malignancies, identified 17 candidate master regulators (MRs) as mechanistic determinants of TI-Treg transcriptional state. Pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screening in\u00a0vivo, using a chimeric hematopoietic stem cell transplant model, confirmed the essentiality of eight MRs in TI-Treg recruitment and/or retention without affecting other T\u00a0cell subtypes, and targeting one of the most significant MRs (Trps1) by CRISPR KO significantly reduced ectopic tumor growth. Analysis of drugs capable of inverting TI-Treg MR activity identified low-dose gemcitabine as the top prediction. Indeed, gemcitabine treatment inhibited tumor growth in immunocompetent but not immunocompromised allografts, increased anti-PD-1 efficacy, and depleted MR-expressing TI-Tregs in\u00a0vivo. This study provides key insight into Treg signaling, specifically in the context of cancer, and a generalizable strategy to systematically elucidate and target MR proteins in immunosuppressive subpopulations.",

        "Title": "Construction of Fusion Protein for Enhanced Small RNA Loading to Extracellular Vesicles.",
        "Abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) naturally carry cargo from producer cells, such as RNA and protein, and can transfer these messengers to other cells and tissue. This ability provides an interesting opportunity for using EVs as delivery vehicles for therapeutic agents, such as for gene therapy. However, endogenous loading of cargo, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), is not very efficient as the copy number of miRNAs per EV is quite low. Therefore, new methods and tools to enhance the loading of small RNAs is required. In the current study, we developed fusion protein of EV membrane protein CD9 and RNA-binding protein AGO2 (hCD9.hAGO2). We show that the EVs engineered with hCD9.hAGO2 contain significantly higher levels of miRNA or shRNA (miR-466c or shRNA-451, respectively) compared to EVs that are isolated from cells that only overexpress the desired miRNA or shRNA. These hCD9.hAGO2 engineered EVs also transfer their RNA cargo to recipient cells more efficiently. We were not able to detect changes in gene expression levels in recipient cells after the EV treatments, but we show that the cell viability of HUVECs was increased after hCD9.hAGO2 EV treatments. This technical study characterizes the hCD9.hAGO2 fusion protein for the future development of enhanced RNA loading to EVs.",

Yet, adaptive resistance mechanisms, induced by rapid, context-specific signaling network rewiring, continue to challenge therapeutic efficacy. By leveraging progress in proteomic technologies and network-based methodologies, over the past decade, we developed VESPA-an algorithm designed to elucidate mechanisms of cell response and adaptation to drug perturbations-and used it to analyze 7-point phosphoproteomic time series from colorectal cancer cells treated with clinically-relevant inhibitors and control media. Interrogation of tumor-specific enzyme/substrate interactions accurately inferred kinase and phosphatase activity, based on their inferred substrate phosphorylation state, effectively accounting for signal cross-talk and sparse phosphoproteome coverage. The analysis elucidated time-dependent signaling pathway response to each drug perturbation and, more importantly, cell adaptive response and rewiring that was experimentally confirmed by CRISPRko assays, suggesting broad applicability to cancer and other diseases.",

However, recent studies have shown that miRNAs have a role in the regulation of genes in the nucleus, where they are abundantly located. We show here that in mouse endothelial cell line (C166), nuclear microRNA miR-466c participates in the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor a (Vegfa) gene expression in hypoxia. Upregulation of Vegfa expression in response to hypoxia was significantly compromised after removal of miR-466c with CRISPR-Cas9 genomic deletion. We identified a promoter-associated long non-coding RNA on mouse Vegfa promoter and show that miR-466c directly binds to this transcript to modulate Vegfa expression. Collectively, these observations suggest that miR-466c regulates Vegfa gene transcription in the nucleus by targeting the promoter, and expands on our understanding of the role of miRNAs well beyond their canonical role.",

        "Abstract": "Ischemic stroke, the third leading cause of death in the Western world, affects mainly the elderly and is strongly associated with comorbid conditions such as atherosclerosis or diabetes, which are pathologically characterized by increased inflammation and are known to influence the outcome of stroke. Stroke incidence peaks during influenza seasons, and patients suffering from infections such as pneumonia prior to stroke exhibit a worse stroke outcome. Earlier studies have shown that comorbidities aggravate the outcome of stroke, yet the mediators of this phenomenon remain obscure. Here, we show that acute peripheral inflammation aggravates stroke-induced neuronal damage and motor deficits specifically in aged mice. This is associated with increased levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, rather than with an increase of inflammatory mediators in the affected brain parenchyma. Nascent transcriptomics data with mature microRNA sequencing were used to identify the neuron-specific miRNome, in order to decipher dysregulated miRNAs in the brains of aged animals with stroke and co-existing inflammation. We pinpoint a previously uninvestigated miRNA in the brain, miR-127, that is highly neuronal, to be associated with increased cell death in the aged, LPS-injected ischemic mice. Target prediction tools indicate that miR-127 interacts with several basally expressed neuronal genes, and of these we verify miR-127 binding to Psmd3. Finally, we report reduced expression of miR-127 in human stroke brains. Our results underline the impact of peripheral inflammation on the outcome of stroke in aged subjects and pinpoint molecular targets for restoring endogenous neuronal capacity to combat ischemic stroke.",

The available treatments for ischemic stroke, thrombolysis by tissue plasminogen activator, and thrombectomy are suitable only to a fraction of patients and thus novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed.

Delivery of oncolytic viruses in EVs could provide considerable advantages, hiding the viruses from the immune system and providing alternative entry pathways into cancer cells. Here we describe the formation and viral cargo of EVs secreted by cancer cells infected with an oncolytic adenovirus (IEVs, infected cell-derived EVs) as a function of time after infection. IEVs were secreted already before the lytic release of virions and their structure resembled normally secreted EVs, suggesting that they were not just apoptotic fragments of infected cells. IEVs were able to carry the viral genome and induce infection in other cancer cells. As such, the role of EVs in the life cycle of adenoviruses may be an important part of a successful infection and may also be harnessed for cancer- and gene therapy.",

        "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that have well-characterized roles in cytoplasmic gene regulation, where they act by binding to mRNA transcripts and inhibiting their translation (i.e. post-transcriptional gene silencing, PTGS). However, miRNAs have also been implicated in transcriptional gene regulation and alternative splicing, events that are restricted to the cell nucleus. Here we performed nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation in a mouse endothelial cell line and characterized the localization of miRNAs in response to hypoxia using small RNA sequencing. A highly diverse population of abundant miRNA species was detected in the nucleus, of which the majority (56%) was found to be preferentially localized in one compartment or the other. Induction of hypoxia resulted in changes in miRNA levels in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, with the majority of changes being restricted to one location and not the other. Notably, the classical hypoxamiR (miR-210-3p) was highly up-regulated in the nuclear compartment after hypoxic stimulus. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated level of molecular complexity in the physiological response occurring in ischemic tissue. Furthermore, widespread differential miRNA expression in the nucleus strongly suggests that these small RNAs are likely to perform extensive nuclear regulatory functions in the general case.",

        "Abstract": "Point mutations in cancer have been extensively studied but chromosomal gains and losses have been more challenging to interpret due to their unspecific nature. Here we examine high-resolution allelic imbalance (AI) landscape in 1699 colorectal cancers, 256 of which have been whole-genome sequenced (WGSed). The imbalances pinpoint 38 genes as plausible AI targets based on previous knowledge. Unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and activation screens identified in total 79 genes within AI peaks regulating cell growth. Genetic and functional data implicate loss of TP53 as a sufficient driver of AI. The WGS highlights an influence of copy number aberrations on the rate of detected somatic point mutations. Importantly, the data reveal several associations between AI target genes, suggesting a role for a network of lineage-determining transcription factors in colorectal tumorigenesis. Overall, the results unravel the contribution of AI in colorectal cancer and provide a plausible explanation why so few genes are commonly affected by point mutations in cancers.",

MSI colorectal cancers (CRCs), however, also contain more point mutations than microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors, yet they have not been as comprehensively studied. To identify candidate driver genes affected by point mutations in MSI CRC, we ranked genes based on mutation significance while correcting for replication timing and gene expression utilizing an algorithm, MutSigCV Somatic point mutation data from the exome kit-targeted area from 24 exome-sequenced sporadic MSI CRCs and respective normals, and 12 whole-genome-sequenced sporadic MSI CRCs and respective normals were utilized. The top 73 genes were validated\u00a0in 93 additional MSI CRCs. The MutSigCV ranking identified several well-established MSI CRC driver genes and provided additional evidence for previously proposed CRC candidate genes as well as shortlisted genes that have to our knowledge not been linked to CRC before.

        "Abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) is the master regulator of angiogenesis, vascular permeability and growth. However, its role in mature blood vessels is still not well understood. To better understand the role of VEGF-A in the adult vasculature, we generated a VEGF-A knockdown mouse model carrying a doxycycline (dox)-regulatable short hairpin RNA (shRNA) transgene, which silences VEGF-A. The aim was to find the critical level of VEGF-A reduction for vascular well-being in vivo. In vitro, the dox-inducible lentiviral shRNA vector decreased VEGF-A expression efficiently and dose-dependently in mouse endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. In the generated transgenic mice plasma VEGF-A levels decreased shortly after the dox treatment but returned back to normal after two weeks. VEGF-A expression decreased shortly after the dox treatment only in some tissues. Surprisingly, increasing the dox exposure time and dose led to elevated VEGF-A expression in some tissues of both wildtype and knockdown mice, suggesting that dox itself has an effect on VEGF-A expression. When the effect of dox on VEGF-A levels was further tested in na\u00efve/non-transduced cells, the dox administration led to a decreased VEGF-A expression in endothelial cells but to an increased expression in cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, the VEGF-A knockdown was achieved in a dox-regulatable fashion with a VEGF-A shRNA vector in vitro, but not in the knockdown mouse model in vivo. Dox itself was found to regulate VEGF-A expression explaining the unexpected results in mice. The effect of dox on VEGF-A levels might at least partly explain its previously reported beneficial effects on myocardial and brain ischemia. Also, this effect on VEGF-A should be taken into account in all studies using dox-regulated vectors.",

Here, Random Sequence Labels (RSLs) are incorporated into the guide library, which act as unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to allow massively parallel lineage tracing and lineage dropout screening. RSLs greatly improve the reproducibility of results by increasing both the precision and the accuracy of screens.

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases is steadily increasing, and it is the leading cause of death worldwide. Therefore, new treatments, such as gene therapy are needed. During the last decade, the role of small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level has been shown. Promoter-targeted small RNAs recruit histone-modifying enzymes and can either repress or induce target gene expression. As an example, we have targeted mouse VEGF-A promoter with small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and identified two shRNAs which either repressed or induced VEGF-A expression on messenger RNA and protein level in vitro, depending on the targeted location. The changes in expression levels correlate with changes in the levels of epigenetic markers, such as histone modifications associated with repressed or active state of chromatin. In ischemic mouse hindlimbs, upregulation of VEGF-A expression increased vascularity and blood flow. When VEGF-A was upregulated in mouse myocardial infarction model, the blood vessel formation in the risk zone was observed and infarct size was significantly decreased already 2 weeks after treatment. We suggest that epigenetic upregulation of VEGF-A by ncRNAs can be transferred to clinical use for the treatment of ischemic diseases in the near future.",

        "Abstract": "MED12 is a key component of the transcription-regulating Mediator complex. Specific missense and in-frame insertion/deletion mutations in exons 1 and 2 have been identified in uterine leiomyomas, breast tumors, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Here, we characterize the first MED12 5' end nonsense mutation (c.97G>T, p.E33X) identified in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and show that it escapes nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) by using an alternative translation initiation site. The resulting N-terminally truncated protein is unable to enter the nucleus due to the lack of identified nuclear localization signal (NLS). The absence of NLS prevents the mutant MED12 protein to be recognized by importin-\u03b1 and subsequent loading into the nuclear pore complex. Due to this mislocalization, all interactions between the MED12 mutant and other Mediator components are lost. Our findings provide new mechanistic insights into the MED12 functions and indicate that somatic nonsense mutations in early exons may avoid NMD.",

        "Abstract": "To identify cell cycle regulators that enable cancer cells to replicate DNA and divide in an unrestricted manner, we performed a parallel genome-wide RNAi screen in normal and cancer cell lines. In addition to many shared regulators, we found that tumor and normal cells are differentially sensitive to loss of the histone genes transcriptional regulator CASP8AP2. In cancer cells, loss of CASP8AP2 leads to a failure to synthesize sufficient amount of histones in the S-phase of the cell cycle, resulting in slowing of individual replication forks. Despite this, DNA replication fails to arrest, and tumor cells progress in an elongated S-phase that lasts several days, finally resulting in death of most of the affected cells. In contrast, depletion of CASP8AP2 in normal cells triggers a response that arrests viable cells in S-phase. The arrest is dependent on p53, and preceded by accumulation of markers of DNA damage, indicating that nucleosome depletion is sensed in normal cells via a DNA-damage -like response that is defective in tumor cells.",

Interestingy, loss of RhoA is synthetic lethal with oncogenic Myc, a master transcription factor that turns on anabolic metabolism to promote cell growth in many cancers. We show evidence indicating that the synthetic lethal interaction between RhoA loss and Myc arises from deficiency in glutamine utilization, resulting from impaired co-regulation of glutaminase expression and anaplerosis by Myc and RhoA - serum response factor (SRF) pathway. The results suggest metabolic coordination between Myc and RhoA/SRF in sustaining cancer cell viability and indicate RhoA/SRF as a potential vulnerability in cancer cells for therapeutic targeting.",

        "Title": "Selective release of muscle-specific, extracellular microRNAs during myogenic differentiation.",
        "Abstract": "MyomiRs are muscle-specific microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate myoblast proliferation and differentiation. Extracellular myomiRs (ex-myomiRs) are highly enriched in the serum of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients and dystrophic mouse models and consequently have potential as disease biomarkers. The biological significance of miRNAs present in the extracellular space is not currently well understood. Here we demonstrate that ex-myomiR levels are elevated in perinatal muscle development, during the regenerative phase that follows exercise-induced myoinjury, and concomitant with myoblast differentiation in culture. Whereas ex-myomiRs are progressively and specifically released by differentiating human primary myoblasts and C2C12 cultures, chemical induction of apoptosis in C2C12 cells results in indiscriminate miRNA release. The selective release of myomiRs as a consequence of cellular differentiation argues against the idea that they are solely waste products of muscle breakdown, and suggests they may serve a biological function in specific physiological contexts. Ex-myomiRs in culture supernatant and serum are predominantly non-vesicular, and their release is independent of ceramide-mediated vesicle secretion. Furthermore, ex-myomiRs levels are reduced in aged dystrophic mice, likely as a consequence of chronic muscle wasting. In conclusion, we show that myomiR release accompanies periods of myogenic differentiation in cell culture and in vivo. Serum myomiR abundance is therefore a function of the regenerative/degenerative status of the muscle, overall muscle mass, and tissue expression levels. These findings have implications for the use of ex-myomiRs as biomarkers for DMD disease progression and monitoring response to therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) causes Kaposi's sarcoma and certain lymphoproliferative malignancies. Latent infection is established in the majority of tumor cells, whereas lytic replication is reactivated in a small fraction of cells, which is important for both virus spread and disease progression. A siRNA screen for novel regulators of KSHV reactivation identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 as a negative regulator of viral reactivation. Depletion of MDM2, a repressor of p53, favored efficient activation of the viral lytic transcription program and viral reactivation. During lytic replication cells activated a p53 response, accumulated DNA damage and arrested at G2-phase. Depletion of p21, a p53 target gene, restored cell cycle progression and thereby impaired the virus reactivation cascade delaying the onset of virus replication induced cytopathic effect. Herpesviruses are known to reactivate in response to different kinds of stress, and our study now highlights the molecular events in the stressed host cell that KSHV has evolved to utilize to ensure efficient viral lytic replication.",

Mutations in exon 2 of the gene encoding MED12, a key subunit of the regulatory kinase module in Mediator, are extremely frequent in uterine leiomyomas, breast fibroadenomas, and phyllodes tumors. These mutations disrupt kinase module interactions and lead to diminished Mediator-associated kinase activity.

        "Abstract": "This review discusses recent developments in the use of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) for the regulation of therapeutically relevant genes, with special focus on applications for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The interest in using ncRNAs as therapeutics has steadily increased since the discovery of RNA interference. During the last decade it has become evident that these RNAs, delivered either as oligos or expressed as small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) from vectors, can either upregulate (transcriptional gene activation, TGA) or downregulate (transcriptional gene silencing, TGS) gene expression, typically inducing epigenetic changes in their target sites in the chromatin. Also, the important role of naturally occurring long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been recently discovered and will likely provide new insights into cardiovascular pathology and provide new treatment strategies based on the manipulation of their expression. In this review, we discuss the possibility of using ncRNAs for activating or silencing therapeutically relevant genes, such as VEGF-A, for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.",

        "Title": "The Glanville fritillary genome retains an ancient karyotype and reveals selective chromosomal fusions in Lepidoptera.",
        "Abstract": "Previous studies have reported that chromosome synteny in Lepidoptera has been well conserved, yet the number of haploid chromosomes varies widely from 5 to 223. Here we report the genome (393\u2009Mb) of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia; Nymphalidae), a widely recognized model species in metapopulation biology and eco-evolutionary research, which has the putative ancestral karyotype of n=31. Using a phylogenetic analyses of Nymphalidae and of other Lepidoptera, combined with orthologue-level comparisons of chromosomes, we conclude that the ancestral lepidopteran karyotype has been n=31 for at least 140\u2009My. We show that fusion chromosomes have retained the ancestral chromosome segments and very few rearrangements have occurred across the fusion sites. The same, shortest ancestral chromosomes have independently participated in fusion events in species with smaller karyotypes. The short chromosomes have higher rearrangement rate than long ones. These characteristics highlight distinctive features of the evolutionary dynamics of butterflies and moths.",

        "Abstract": "Somatic mutations in exon 2 of the RNA polymerase II transcriptional Mediator subunit MED12 occur at very high frequency (\u223c70%) in uterine leiomyomas. However, the influence of these mutations on Mediator function and the molecular basis for their tumorigenic potential remain unknown. To clarify the impact of these mutations, we used affinity-purification mass spectrometry to establish the global protein-protein interaction profiles for both wild-type and mutant MED12. We found that uterine leiomyoma-linked mutations in MED12 led to a highly specific decrease in its association with Cyclin C-CDK8/CDK19 and loss of Mediator-associated CDK activity. Mechanistically, this occurs through disruption of a MED12-Cyclin C binding interface that we also show is required for MED12-mediated stimulation of Cyclin C-dependent CDK8 kinase activity. These findings indicate that uterine leiomyoma-linked mutations in MED12 uncouple Cyclin C-CDK8/19 from core Mediator and further identify the MED12/Cyclin C interface as a prospective therapeutic target in CDK8-driven cancers.",

        "Abstract": "\"Epigenetherapy\" alters epigenetic status of the targeted chromatin and modifies expression of the endogenous therapeutic gene. In this study we used lentiviral in vivo delivery of small hairpin RNA (shRNA) into hearts in a murine infarction model. shRNA complementary to the promoter of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) was able to upregulate endogenous VEGF-A expression. Histological and multiphoton microscope analysis confirmed the therapeutic effect in the transduced hearts. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed in vivo that the infarct size was significantly reduced in the treatment group 14 days after the epigenetherapy. Importantly, we show that promoter-targeted shRNA upregulates all isoforms of endogenous VEGF-A and that an intact hairpin structure is required for the shRNA activity. In conclusion, regulation of gene expression at the promoter level is a promising new treatment strategy for myocardial infarction and also potentially useful for the upregulation of other endogenous genes.",

Potential mutation hot spots were confirmed in 15 genes; ADAR, DCAF12L2, GLT1D1, ITGA7, MAP1B, MRGPRX4, PSRC1, RANBP2, RPS6KL1, SNCAIP, TCEAL6, TUBB6, WBP5, VEGFB, and ZBTB2; these were validated in 86\u00a0tumors with microsatellite instability. ZBTB2, RANBP2, and PSRC1 also were found to contain hot spot mutations in the validation set. The form of ZBTB2 associated with colorectal cancer increased cell proliferation. The mutation hot spots might be used to develop personalized tumor profiling and therapy.",

NP170-PFCE complexed with miRNAs accumulate whitin the cell's endolysosomal compartment and interact with higher frequency with argonaute2 (Ago2) and GW182 proteins, which are involved in the biological action of miRNAs, than commercial complexes formed by commercial reagents and miRNA, which in turn accumulate in the cell cytoplasm. The release of miRNA132 (miR132) from the NPs increased 3-fold the survival of endothelial cells (ECs) transplanted in vivo and 3.5-fold the blood perfusion in ischemic limbs relatively to control.",

        "Abstract": "In this work, we map the transcriptional targets of 107 previously identified Drosophila genes whose loss caused the strongest cell-cycle phenotypes in a genome-wide RNA interference screen and mine the resulting data computationally. Besides confirming existing knowledge, the analysis revealed several regulatory systems, among which were two highly-specific and interconnected feedback circuits, one between the ribosome and the proteasome that controls overall protein homeostasis, and the other between the ribosome and Myc/Max that regulates the protein synthesis capacity of cells. We also identified a set of genes that alter the timing of mitosis without affecting gene expression, indicating that the cyclic transcriptional program that produces the components required for cell division can be partially uncoupled from the cell division process itself. These genes all have a function in a pathway that regulates the phosphorylation state of Cdk1. We provide evidence showing that this pathway is involved in regulation of cell size, indicating that a Cdk1-regulated cell size checkpoint exists in metazoans.",

        "Abstract": "Multiple cancer-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been mapped to conserved sequences within a 500-kilobase region upstream of the MYC oncogene on human chromosome 8q24. These SNPs may affect cancer development through altered regulation of MYC expression, but this hypothesis has been difficult to confirm. We generated mice deficient in Myc-335, a putative MYC regulatory element that contains rs6983267, a SNP accounting for more human cancer-related morbidity than any other genetic variant or mutation. In Myc-335 null mice, Myc transcripts were expressed in the intestinal crypts in a pattern similar to that in wild-type mice but at modestly reduced levels. The mutant mice displayed no overt phenotype but were markedly resistant to intestinal tumorigenesis induced by the APCmin mutation. These results establish that a cancer-associated SNP identified in human genome-wide association studies has a functional effect in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Recent genome-wide association studies have identified multiple regions at 8q24 that confer susceptibility to many cancers. In our previous work, we showed that the colorectal cancer (CRC) risk variant rs6983267 at 8q24 resides within a TCF4 binding site at the MYC-335 enhancer, with the risk allele G having a stronger binding capacity and Wnt responsiveness. Here, we searched for other potential functional variants within MYC-335. Genetic variation within MYC-335 was determined in samples from individuals of European, African, and Asian descent, with emphasis on variants in putative transcription factor binding sites. A 2-bp GA deletion rs67491583 was found to affect a growth factor independent (GFI) binding site and was present only in individuals with African ancestry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation performed in heterozygous cells showed that the GA deletion had an ability to reduce binding of the transcriptional repressors GFI1 and GFI1b. Screening of 1,027 African American colorectal cancer cases and 1,773 healthy controls did not reveal evidence for association (odds ratio: 1.17, 95% confidence interval: 0.97-1.41, P = 0.095). In this study, rs67491583 was identified as another functional variant in the CRC-associated enhancer MYC-335, but further studies are needed to establish the role of rs67491583 in the colorectal cancer predisposition of African Americans.",

The exact mechanism of function is still unclear but the feasibility to activate or repress endogenous gene expression with small RNA molecules has already been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. In traditional gene therapy non-mutated or otherwise useful genes are inserted into patient's cells to treat a disease. In epigenetherapy the action of small RNAs is utilized by delivering only the small RNAs to patient's cells where they then regulate gene expression by epigenetic mechanisms. This method could be widely useful not only for basic research but also for clinical applications of small RNAs.",

        "Abstract": "The role of small RNAs in epigenetic regulation is an emerging field. This research may also open novel treatment strategies based on manipulation of the epigenetic status of the target tissues. Our objective is to review epigenetic regulation of key vascular genes and growth factors. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is one of the key players in regulating and maintaining cardiovascular functions and pathology. Although its epigenetic regulation is still not completely understood, expression of the VEGF gene can be manipulated by epigenetic mechanisms using small RNAs that are targeted to the gene promoter which results in the alteration of histone code. VEGF exerts its effects mostly through two receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, and their expression is also regulated by promoter DNA methylation in various cancer cells. These findings suggest the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of vascular functions.",

        "Abstract": "The biologically most active vitamin D compound, 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D\u2083 (1\u03b1,25(OH)\u2082D\u2083), influences the status of inflammation by modulating the expression of several cytokine genes. In this study, we have examined the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of interleukin 10 (IL-10) by 1\u03b1,25(OH)\u2082D\u2083 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated human monocytes (THP-1). Quantitative PCR showed that IL-10 mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated (2.8-fold) during the first 8h of 1\u03b1,25(OH)\u2082D\u2083 treatment, while after 48 h it was up-regulated (3-fold). Gel shift and quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) binds in a cyclical fashion to a promoter region 1500-1700 bp upstream of the IL-10 transcription start site (TSS) containing two conserved VDR binding sites. Targeting of VDR binding sites by enhancer specific duplex RNAs revealed that only the more distal element is functional and chromosome conformation capture analysis suggested that this region loops 1\u03b1,25(OH)\u2082D\u2083-dependently to the TSS. Quantitative ChIP and micrococcal nuclease assays also revealed 1\u03b1,25(OH)\u2082D\u2083-dependent cyclical epigenetic changes and nucleosome remodeling at this promoter region. In conclusion, in LPS-treated THP-1 cells the primary effect of 1\u03b1,25(OH)\u2082D\u2083 on IL-10 expression is down-regulation, which is achieved via a cyclical recruitment of VDR to the promoter.",

        "Abstract": "The circadian clock regulates daily variations in physiologic processes. CLOCK acts as a regulator in the circadian apparatus controlling the expression of other clock genes, including PER1. Clock genes have been implicated in cancer-related functions; in this work, we investigated CLOCK as a possible target of somatic mutations in microsatellite unstable colorectal cancers. Combining microarray gene expression data and public gene sequence information, we identified CLOCK as 1 of 790 putative novel microsatellite instability (MSI) target genes. A total of 101 MSI colorectal carcinomas (CRC) were sequenced for a coding microsatellite in CLOCK. The effect of restoring CLOCK expression was studied in LS180 cells lacking wild-type CLOCK by stably expressing GST-CLOCK or glutathione S-transferase empty vector and testing the effects of UV-induced apoptosis and radiation by DNA content analysis using flow cytometry. Putative novel CLOCK target genes were searched by using ChIP-seq. CLOCK mutations occurred in 53% of MSI CRCs. Restoring CLOCK expression in cells with biallelic CLOCK inactivation resulted in protection against UV-induced apoptosis and decreased G(2)-M arrest in response to ionizing radiation. Using ChIP-Seq, novel CLOCK-binding elements were identified near DNA damage genes p21, NBR1, BRCA1, and RAD50. CLOCK is shown to be mutated in cancer, and altered response to DNA damage provides one plausible mechanism of tumorigenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Members of the large ETS family of transcription factors (TFs) have highly similar DNA-binding domains (DBDs)-yet they have diverse functions and activities in physiology and oncogenesis. Some differences in DNA-binding preferences within this family have been described, but they have not been analysed systematically, and their contributions to targeting remain largely uncharacterized. We report here the DNA-binding profiles for all human and mouse ETS factors, which we generated using two different methods: a high-throughput microwell-based TF DNA-binding specificity assay, and protein-binding microarrays (PBMs). Both approaches reveal that the ETS-binding profiles cluster into four distinct classes, and that all ETS factors linked to cancer, ERG, ETV1, ETV4 and FLI1, fall into just one of these classes. We identify amino-acid residues that are critical for the differences in specificity between all the classes, and confirm the specificities in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) for a member of each class. The results indicate that even relatively small differences in in vitro binding specificity of a TF contribute to site selectivity in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Primary 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3))-responding genes are controlled by the vitamin D receptor (VDR) binding to specific sites (VDREs) that are located within the regulatory regions of these genes. According to previous studies, the gene encoding 25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) 24-hydroxylase, CYP24, which is the strongest known 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)-responsive gene, has multiple VDREs that locate within the proximal and the distal promoter. However, it has remained unclear, what is the biological role of these regions and how they participate in the regulation of transcription. In this study, we found a different CYP24 expression profile in normal (MCF-10A) and malignant (MCF-7) human mammary cells. Moreover, CYP24 mRNA showed to be three times more stable in MCF-7 cells than in MCF-10A cells. We studied the mechanism of this difference using expression profiling, quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation and chromosome conformation capture assays. Interestingly, the number of functional VDREs was higher in MCF-7 cells than in MCF-10A cells. Three functional VDREs in MCF-7 cells are connected to linear mRNA accumulation, whereas only one VDRE seems to lead to stepwise CYP24 mRNA accumulation in MCF-10A cells. The distal VDREs were involved in transcriptional regulation via ligand-dependent, dynamic chromatin looping, which brings cyclically the distal elements together either individually or simultaneously next to the transcription start site. In conclusion, our data suggest that in comparison to normal cells, clearing of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) is enhanced in malignant cells due to differences in transcriptional regulation of CYP24 and metabolism of CYP24 mRNA.",

We report here that the risk allele G shows copy number increase during CRC development. Our computer algorithm, Enhancer Element Locator (EEL), identified an enhancer element that contains rs6983267. The element drove expression of a reporter gene in a pattern that is consistent with regulation by the key CRC pathway Wnt. rs6983267 affects a binding site for the Wnt-regulated transcription factor TCF4, with the risk allele G showing stronger binding in vitro and in vivo. Genome-wide ChIP assay revealed the element as the strongest TCF4 binding site within 1 Mb of MYC. An unambiguous correlation between rs6983267 genotype and MYC expression was not detected, and additional work is required to scrutinize all possible targets of the enhancer. Our work provides evidence that the common CRC predisposition associated with 8q24 arises from enhanced responsiveness to Wnt signaling.",

        "Abstract": "The contribution of epigenetic mechanisms to cardiovascular diseases remains poorly understood. Hypomethylation of genomic DNA is present in human atherosclerotic lesions and methylation changes also occur at the promoter level of several genes involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, such as extracellular superoxide dismutase, estrogen receptor-alpha, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and 15-lipoxygenase. So far, no clear data is available about histone modification marks in atherosclerotic lesions. It remains unclear whether epigenetic changes are causally related to the pathogenetic features, such as clonal proliferation of lesion smooth muscle cells, lipid accumulation and modulation of immune responses in the lesions, or whether they merely represent a consequence of the ongoing pathological process. However, epigenetic changes could at least partly explain poorly understood environmental and dietary effects on atherogenesis and the rapid increases and decreases in the incidence of coronary heart disease observed in various populations. RNAi mechanisms may also contribute to the epigenetic regulation of vascular cells. Therapies directed towards modification of the epigenetic status of vascular cells might provide new tools to control atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D) has angiogenic and lymphangiogenic activity, but its biologic role has remained unclear because knockout mice showed no clear phenotype. Transgenic (TG) mice expressing the mature form of human VEGF-D (hVEGF-D) were produced by lentiviral (LV) transgenesis using the perivitelline injection method. Several viable founders showed a macroscopically normal phenotype and the transgene transmitted through germ line. Expression of hVEGF-D mRNA was high in skeletal muscles, skin, pancreas, heart, and spleen. A significant increase was found in capillary density of skeletal muscles and myocardium, whereas no changes were observed in lymphatic capillary density. After induction of hindlimb ischemia, the TG mice showed enhanced capacity for muscle regeneration. However, on aging the TG mice had significantly increased mortality from malignant tumors, of which half were breast adenocarcinomas characterized with the absence of periductal muscle cells. Some tumors metastasized into the lungs. In addition, lung and skin tumors were found, but no blood- or lymphatic vessel-derived malignancies were detected. We conclude that in mice hVEGF-D is an angiogenic factor associated with improved muscle regeneration after ischemic injury but also with increased incidence of tumor formation with a preference for mammary gland tumors.",

        "Abstract": "Shortage of oxygen is one of the prime stress conditions in tissues. In this study, we looked for microRNAs expressed during hypoxia and showed that miR-210 expression was upregulated in response to hypoxia in vitro and in vivo. An active form of the HIF-1alpha induced the expression of miR-210, showing the involvement of the HIF-1 signaling pathway in miR-210 gene transcription. Furthermore, miR-210 was shown to bind to the predicted target sites of ephrin-A3 or neuronal pentraxin 1, causing repression in luciferase reporter activity. Contrary to the microRNA-mediated repression hypothesis, ephrin-A3 was expressed at very high levels in post-ischemic mouse hippocampus in vivo. Thus, the regulatory effects of miR-210 on its targets in vivo need to be further characterized.",

        "Title": "Selective use of multiple vitamin D response elements underlies the 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-mediated negative regulation of the human CYP27B1 gene.",
        "Abstract": "The human 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) 1alpha-hydroxylase, which is encoded by the CYP27B1 gene, catalyzes the metabolic activation of the 25(OH)D3 into 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1alpha,25(OH)2D3), the most biologically potent vitamin D3 metabolite. The most important regulator of CYP27B1 gene activity is 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 itself, which down-regulates the gene. The down-regulation of the CYP27B1 gene has been proposed to involve a negative vitamin D response element (nVDRE) that is located approximately 500 bp upstream from transcription start site (TSS). In this study, we reveal the existence of two new VDR-binding regions in the distal promoter, 2.6 and 3.2 kb upstream from the TSS, that bind vitamin D receptor-retinoid X receptor complexes. Since the down regulation of the CYP27B1 gene is tissue- and cell-type selective, a comparative study was done for the new 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-responsive regions in HEK-293 human embryonic kidney and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells that reflect tissues that, respectively, are permissive and non-permissive to the phenomenon of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-mediated down-regulation of this gene. We found significant differences in the composition of protein complexes associated with these CYP27B1 promoter regions in the different cell lines, some of which reflect the capability of transcriptional repression of the CYP27B1 gene in these different cells. In addition, chromatin architecture differed with respect to chromatin looping in the two cell lines, as the new distal regions were differentially connected with the proximal promoter. This data explains, in part, why the human CYP27B1 gene is repressed in HEK-293 but not in MCF-7 cells.",

Long-term cellular expression of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules required for many gene therapy applications can be achieved by lentiviral vectors (LVs). The two most commonly used promoters to drive the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression are the human U6 small nuclear promoter (U6) and the human H1 promoter (H1).",

        "Abstract": "Neointimal formation is a common feature after angioplasty, bypass grafting and stenting. Angioplasty damages endothelium, causing pathological changes in arteries which lead to smooth muscle cell proliferation, synthesis of extracellular matrix components and eventually restenosis formation. Adenoviruses offer an efficient transgene expression in the vascular system. In this study, we compared the effects of different gene combinations. We wanted to find out whether adenoviral catheter-mediated delivery of an additive combination of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A with VEGF-C is more effective than the combination of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) alone or with VEGF-C in a rabbit balloon denudation model. Additionally, we wanted to clarify whether the combination therapy prolongs the treatment effect. It was found that TIMP-1 alone prevents restenosis and that the combination of VEGF-A and VEGF-C has a similar effect at the 2-week time point. However, the combination of VEGF-A and VEGF-C lost the treatment effect at the 4-week time point due to the catch-up growth of neointima. On the other hand, TIMP-1 and the combination of TIMP-1 with VEGF-C still had an extended treatment effect at the 4-week time point. When considering the gene combination used in this study, it is concluded that gene therapy with adenoviral TIMP-1 alone is sufficient in reducing restenosis and that combination gene therapy does not bring any significant advantages.",

        "Abstract": "We have developed an ex vivo gene transfer technique to rabbit arterial wall using autologous smooth muscle cells (SMCs). SMCs were harvested from rabbit ear artery, transduced in vitro with vesicular stomatitis virus G-glycoprotein pseudotyped retrovirus or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and returned to the adventitial surface of the carotid artery using a periadventitial silicone collar or collagen sheet placed around the artery. Beta-galactosidase (lacZ) and human apolipoprotein E3 (apoE3) cDNAs were used as transgenes. After retrovirus-mediated gene transfer of lacZ the selected cells implanted with high efficiency and expressed lacZ marker gene at a very high level 7 and 14 days after the operation. The level of lacZ expression decreased thereafter but was still detectable 12 weeks after the gene transfer, and was exclusively localized to the site of cell implantation inside the collar. Utilizing FIV vector expressing apoE3, low levels of apoE were measured from serum collected from a low-density lipoprotein receptor deficient Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits 1 month after the gene transfer. The physiological effect of apoE expression was detected as transiently elevated serum cholesterol levels. The results indicate that the model can be used for high efficiency local gene transfer in arteries, e.g. during vascular surgery. The model is also valuable for studying expression, stability and safety of new gene transfer vectors and their expression products in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "In this study we have attached cyclic targeting peptides by way of a poly-lysine spacer on the surface of an adenovirus using a transglutaminase enzymatic reaction to enhance transduction efficiency and to modify tissue tropism in vivo. Nuclear targeted lacZ- and TIMP-1-encoding adenoviruses were coupled to a peptide-motif (HWGF) that can bind to matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. Modified viruses were used to evaluate gene transfer efficiency, biodistribution, and the effect on neointima formation following balloon denudation injury. In vitro, both rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells and human endothelial hybridoma cells demonstrated significantly increased reporter gene expression with HWGF-modified adenoviruses (AdlacZ(HWGF)) compared with control (AdlacZ) or mismatch peptide-modified (AdlacZ(MM)) adenoviruses. However, in human hepatocellular Hep-G2 cells, both AdlacZ(HWGF) and AdlacZ(MM) produced significantly lower transgene expression compared with the respective control viruses. In vivo, local intravascular catheter-mediated gene transfer of a HWGF-targeted TIMP-1-encoding adenovirus (AdTIMP-1(HWGF)) significantly reduced intimal thickening in a rabbit aortic balloon denudation model (P < 0.05) compared with the control adenovirus. X-Gal staining and biodistribution analyses with TaqMan RT-PCR revealed that the cyclic peptides altered vector tropism and, in particular, reduced transduction of the liver. We found that the HWGF peptide modification increased transduction efficiency of the adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in in vitro and enhanced gene transfer to the arterial wall in vivo; that peptide modification of adenoviruses beneficially modulated tissue tropism in vivo; and that efficient TIMP-1 gene transfer reduced intimal thickening in an established restenosis model in rabbits.",

        "Abstract": "Arterial smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation are central features in atherogenesis. Altered gene expression and cell proliferation in atherosclerotic lesions have some similar characteristics with certain solid tumors and thus might have similar mechanisms that lead to SMC proliferation. Among cancer cells common features are genome-wide hypomethylation which correlates with transformation and tumor progression, and coincident overexpression of methyltransferase (MTase). The purpose of the present study was to analyze whether alterations in DNA methylation and MTase expression are present in atherosclerotic lesions. A significant reduction in genomic 5-methylcytosine content was detected in advanced human atherosclerotic lesions and in lesions of ApoE knock-out mice. SMC were shown to develop hypomethylation in vitro during transformation from a contractile to synthetic phenotype. Balloon denudation of New Zealand White rabbit aorta caused proliferation of intimal SMC with concomitant genomic hypomethylation in the thickened intima. By using in situ hybridization the overall transcriptional activity was found to be increased in clusters of lesion SMC. Marked heterogeneity was seen in MTase mRNA expression in various types of atherosclerotic lesions among intimal and medial SMC. These findings show that (1) genomic hypomethylation occurs during atherogenesis in human, mouse and rabbit lesions and that it correlates with increased transcriptional activity; (2) MTase is expressed in atherosclerotic lesions; and (3) hypomethylation is present in advanced lesions at the same level as in malignant tumors and may affect cellular proliferation and gene expression in atherosclerotic lesions.",

        "Abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a hypoxia-inducible endothelial cell mitogen and survival factor. Its receptor VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1) mediates these effects. We studied the expression of VEGF and VEGFR-2 in ischemic human and rabbit skeletal muscle by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Human samples were obtained from eight lower limb amputations because of acute or chronic critical ischemia. In chronically ischemic human skeletal muscle VEGF and VEGFR-2 expression was restricted to atrophic and regenerating skeletal myocytes, whereas in acutely ischemic limbs VEGF and VEGFR-2 were expressed diffusely in the affected muscle. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha was associated with VEGF and VEGFR-2 expression both in acute and chronic ischemia but not in regeneration. Hindlimb ischemia was induced in 20 New Zealand White rabbits by excising the femoral artery. Magnetic resonance imaging and histological sections revealed extensive ischemic damage in the thigh and leg muscles of ischemic rabbit hindlimbs with VEGF expression similar to acute human lower limb ischemia. After 1 and 3 weeks of ischemia VEGF expression was restricted to regenerating myotubes and by 6 weeks regeneration and expression of VEGF was diminished. VEGFR-2 expression was co-localized with VEGF expression in regenerating myotubes. Macrophages and an increased number of capillaries were associated with areas of ischemic muscle expressing VEGF and VEGFR-2. In conclusion, two patterns of VEGF and VEGFR-2 expression in human and rabbit ischemic skeletal muscle are demonstrated. In acute skeletal muscle ischemia VEGF and VEGFR-2 are expressed diffusely in the affected muscle. In chronic skeletal muscle ischemia and in skeletal muscle recovering from ischemia VEGF and VEGFR-2 expression are restricted to atrophic and regenerating muscle cells suggesting the operation of an autocrine pathway that may promote survival and regeneration of myocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Local gene transfer into the vascular wall offers a promising alternative to treat atherosclerosis-related diseases. Blood vessels are among the easiest targets for gene therapy because of percutaneous, catheter-based treatment methods. On the other hand, gene transfer to the artery wall can also be accomplished from adventitia either by ex vivo gene transfer and implantation of transfected cells or by direct in vivo gene transfer methods. In the future, as the pathological processes in arteries are better understood, several therapeutic genes could be combined and these \"gene cocktails\" are expected to produce enhanced therapeutic effects in vascular gene therapy. We have developed a new, efficient technique for performing ex vivo gene transfer to rabbit arterial wall using autologous SMC. The cells were harvested from rabbit ear artery, transfected in vitro with VSV-G pseudotyped lacZ retrovirus, and returned back to the adventitial surface of the carotid artery using a silicone collar or collagen sheet placed around the artery. The transduced SMCs implanted with a high efficiency and expressed beta-galactosidase marker gene at a very high level 7 days and 14 days after the operation. The level of lacZ expression decreased thereafter, but was still easily detectable for at least 6 months and was exclusively localized to the site of cell implantation inside the collar. Development of new vectors, such as baculovirus, for gene transfer will provide targeted, efficient, and safer methods for gene delivery. Plasmids and viruses coding for more than one protein, and bearing regulatory elements, would be useful for future gene therapy applications. Also, constructing second-generation viruses that contain fewer endogenous genes in their genome may reduce immunological reactions caused by the first-generation adenoviruses. In conditions where stable expression of therapeutic proteins is needed, it is necessary to develop better ex vivo and in vivo gene transfer strategies. Also, production of viruses that can efficiently transfect nondividing cells will be important for future applications of vascular gene therapy. However, current knowledge from vascular gene transfer experiments strongly suggests that vascular gene transfer is a promising new alternative for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",
