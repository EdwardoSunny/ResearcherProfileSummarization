        "Abstract": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a preventable medical condition which has substantial impact on patient morbidity, mortality, and disability. Unfortunately, adherence to the published best practices for VTE prevention, based on patient centered outcomes research (PCOR), is highly variable across U.S. hospitals, which represents a gap between current evidence and clinical practice leading to adverse patient outcomes. This gap is especially large in the case of traumatic brain injury (TBI), where reluctance to initiate VTE prevention due to concerns for potentially increasing the rates of intracranial bleeding drives poor rates of VTE prophylaxis. This is despite research which has shown early initiation of VTE prophylaxis to be safe in TBI without increased risk of delayed neurosurgical intervention or death. Clinical decision support (CDS) is an indispensable solution to close this practice gap; however, design and implementation barriers hinder CDS adoption and successful scaling across health systems. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) informed by PCOR evidence can be deployed using CDS systems to improve the evidence to practice gap. In the Scaling AcceptabLE cDs (SCALED) study, we will implement a VTE prevention CPG within an interoperable CDS system and evaluate both CPG effectiveness (improved clinical outcomes) and CDS implementation.",

Many entry forms include a free-text \"write-in\" option in addition to structured responses. Balancing the flexibility of free-text with the value of collecting data in a structured format is a challenge if the data are to be useful for measuring and mitigating health disparities. While much work has been done to improve collection of race and ethnicity information, how to best collect data related to sexual and gender minority status and military veteran status has been less commonly studied. We analyzed 3,381 patient-provided free-text responses collected via a patient portal for gender identity, sexual orientation, pronouns, and veteran experiences. We identified common responses to better understand our patient population and help improve future iterations of data collection tools.",

        "Abstract": "With widespread electronic health record (EHR) adoption and improvements in health information interoperability in the United States, troves of data are available for knowledge discovery. Several data sharing programs and tools have been developed to support research activities, including efforts funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), EHR vendors, and other public- and private-sector entities. We surveyed 65 leading research institutions (77% response rate) about their use of and value derived from ten programs/tools, including NIH's Accrual to Clinical Trials, Epic Corporation's Cosmos, and the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics consortium. Most institutions participated in multiple programs/tools but reported relatively low usage (even when they participated, they frequently indicated that fewer than one individual/month benefitted from the platform to support research activities). Our findings suggest that investments in research data sharing have not yet achieved desired results.",

        "Title": "Pandemic Telemedicine Adoption Trends in a Predominantly Rural Integrated Health System.",
        "Abstract": "Between March 2020 and February 2022, use of telemedicine services in the U.S. shifted dramatically in response to the evolving SARS-CoV2 pandemic. The initial wave caused many non-emergent clinical services to be postponed, including specialty care clinic visits, which were rapidly converted to telemedicine encounters. Telemedicine use ebbed and flowed with subsequent pandemic waves. This paper describes trends in telemedicine use from March 2020-February 2022 at Geisinger, a predominantly rural integrated health system. It highlights characteristics of 5,390 virtual vs. 15,740 in-person clinic visits to neurosurgery and gastroenterology specialists in December 2021 and January 2022. Differences in ordering of diagnostic testing and prescription medications, as well as post-clinic-visit utilization, varied by specialty. Virtual visits in these specialties saved patients from traveling over 174,700 miles/month to attend appointments. Analyzing telemedicine use patterns can inform future resource allocation and determine when virtual encounters can complement or replace in-person specialty care visits.",

At an integrated academic health system with over 4,100 providers writing notes, we developed a pragmatic approach to assess the use of copy-paste. From January 1-December 31, 2020, approximately 2.3M inpatient notes and 6.6M ambulatory clinic notes were authored in our electronic health record. Of the inpatient notes, 42% used copy-paste, and 19% of overall note content was copied; in ambulatory notes, 18% used copy-paste and 12% of note content was copied. We describe an approach for including providers' copy-paste usage statistics into the ongoing professional practice evaluation process required for hospital accreditation, thereby offering individual training opportunities related to the lack of use of copy-paste or its potential overuse.",

Many health-care organizations are working to collect sexual orientation and gender identity in their electronic health records (EHRs), with the goal of providing more inclusive care to their LGBTQ+ patients. There are significant human and technical barriers to making these efforts successful.

        "Abstract": "The recognition, disambiguation, and expansion of medical abbreviations and acronyms is of upmost importance to prevent medically-dangerous misinterpretation in natural language processing. To support recognition, disambiguation, and expansion, we present the Medical Abbreviation and Acronym Meta-Inventory, a deep database of medical abbreviations. A systematic harmonization of eight source inventories across multiple healthcare specialties and settings identified 104,057 abbreviations with 170,426 corresponding senses. Automated cross-mapping of synonymous records using state-of-the-art machine learning reduced redundancy, which simplifies future application. Additional features include semi-automated quality control to remove errors. The Meta-Inventory demonstrated high completeness or coverage of abbreviations and senses in new clinical text, a substantial improvement over the next largest repository (6-14% increase in abbreviation coverage; 28-52% increase in sense coverage). To our knowledge, the Meta-Inventory is the most complete compilation of medical abbreviations and acronyms in American English to-date. The multiple sources and high coverage support application in varied specialties and settings. This allows for cross-institutional natural language processing, which previous inventories did not support. The Meta-Inventory is available at https://bit.ly/github-clinical-abbreviations .",

However, these advances have brought with them a complex set of demands for healthcare institutions regarding data sharing with topics such as data ownership, the loss of privacy, and the protection of the intellectual property. The lack of clear guidance from government entities often creates conflicting messages about data policy, leaving institutions to develop guidelines themselves. Through discussions with multiple stakeholders at various institutions, we have generated a set of guidelines with 10 key principles to guide the responsible and appropriate use and sharing of clinical data for the purposes of care and discovery. Industry, universities, and healthcare institutions can build upon these guidelines toward creating a responsible, ethical, and practical response to data sharing.",

        "Abstract": "Maternal morbidity and mortality have gained major attention recently, spurred on by rising domestic rates even as maternal mortality decreases in Europe. A major driver of morbidity and mortality among delivering women is postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). PPH is currently phenotyped using the subjective measure of 'Estimated blood loss' (EBL), which has been shown to be unreliable for tracking quality. Here we present a framework for phenotyping PPH into multiple severity levels, using a combination of data-driven techniques and expert-derived clinical indicators. We validate the framework by predicting large drops in hematocrit and quantitative blood loss, finding that the framework performs better in predicting coded PPH than a hematocrit-based predictor or predictors based on other metrics such as blood transfusions, and does better in predicting quantitative blood loss, a gold standard metric for blood loss that we have for a subset of patients, than any predictor we could build using hematocrit drops alone. In all, we present a principled framework that can be used to phenotype PPH in hospitals using readily available EHR data, and that will perform with more granularity and accuracy than existing methods.",

        "Abstract": "Identifying patients at risk of deterioration in the hospital and intervening more quickly to prevent adverse events is a top patient safety priority. Early warning scores (EWS) identify at risk patients, but there is much opportunity for improvement particularly related to increasing lead time - the time from an alert trigger to adverse event (e.g., cardiac arrest, death). Our team develops healthcare process models of clinical concern (HPM-CC) and in this work has identified documentation signals that are proxies of nurses concern and can be used to predict patient risk earlier than current EWS systems that rely only on physiological data. We compared the performance of a validated EWS - the MEWS - to our novel model (MEWS-CC) comprised of MEWS criteria plus 3 proxy variables of nursing concern. MEWS-CC performed similarly to MEWS, with the added benefit of increased the time from EWS trigger to event by 5-26 hours.",

Delayed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus can increase patients' morbidity. In an urban academic medical center with a large clinical data warehouse, we used a novel algorithm to identify 56,794 family members of diabetic patients that were eligible for disease screening. We found that 30.6% of patients did not receive diabetes screening as recommended by current guidelines. Further, our analysis showed that having more than one family member affected and being a female were important contributors to being screened for diabetes mellitus. This study demonstrates that informatics methods applied to electronic health record data can be used to identify patients at risk for disease development, and therefore support clinical care.",

However, few studies have assessed provider's perceptions of an acute care portal after implementation. In this study, we surveyed 63 nurses, physicians, and physician assistants following a 3-year randomized trial of an acute care portal. The survey assessed providers' perceptions of the portal and its impact on care delivery. Respondents reported that the portal positively impacted care, and they perceived that their patients found it usable and trustworthy. Respondents reported that all the portal's features were useful, especially the display of laboratory test results. Compared with the results of a patient survey, providers underestimated the portal's usefulness to patients, and ranked features as ",

The long turnaround time of imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, are a major reason for delays in treatment and disposition. Over an eight-month pre-intervention period during which 10,063 CT scans were ordered in our emergency department, the average time from a CT order to the availability of the radiologist's final report was 5.9 hours (median=4.2 hours). We created a multi-disciplinary team of physicians, nurses, technicians, transporters, informaticians, and engineers to identify barriers and implement technical as well as human-factors solutions. In the corresponding eight-month period after the implementation of the intervention bundle, there was a 1.2 hour reduction in CT turnaround time, despite a 13.8% increase in the number of CT scans ordered (p<0.0001).",

To this end, we simulated the revision of an \"AM Lab Order Set\" under 6 revision approaches. Revisions included changes in the order set content or default settings through 1) population statistics, 2) individualized prediction using machine learning, and 3) clinical knowledge. Revision criteria were determined using electronic health record (EHR) data from 2014 to 2015. Each revision's clinical appropriateness, workload from using the order set, and generalizability across time were evaluated using EHR data from 2016 and 2017. Our results suggest a potential order set revision approach that jointly leverages clinical knowledge and machine learning to improve usability while updating contents based on latest clinical knowledge and best practices.",

        "Abstract": "Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Obtaining patients' smoking status is the first step in delivering smoking cessation counseling. In this study, we assessed the quality of smoking status captured in an electronic health record from a large academic medical center. We analyzed data from structured notes, finding that smoking status was documented in 98% of 64,451 hospital encounters in 2016. 32% hospital encounters had discrepant documentation, and 54.5% of patients had implausible changes (e.g., changes from \"current smoker\" to \"never smoker\"). Overall, only 2.9% of patients were documented as active smokers, but 36.4% were documented as \"unknown\" or had discrepancies in their smoking status. These results suggest that patients that smoke are not appropriately identified. Centralized documentation with clinically actionable smoking status categories and implementation of patient-facing tools that allow patients to directly record their information could improve data quality of smoking status.",

        "Abstract": "Though several institutions offer hospitalized patients access to their medical records through acute care patient portals, no studies have assessed the potential impact of patients' access to physicians' notes through these systems. We employed a mixed-methods approach, including patient surveys, system usage log analysis, and qualitative interviews, to describe patients' perspectives on receiving their clinical notes and usage of the clinical notes feature in an acute care patient portal. Patients visited the clinical notes feature more frequently and for longer durations than any other feature. In qualitative interviews, patients reported improved access to information, better insight into their conditions, decreased anxiety, increased appreciation for clinicians, improvements in health behaviors, and more engagement in care. Our results suggest that sharing notes with hospitalized patients is feasible and beneficial, although further studies should investigate the magnitude of benefit and explore the unintended negative consequences associated with increased transparency of clinical information.",

Electronic health records (EHRs) passively capture a wide range of clinically relevant data and provide a resource for studying the heritability of traits that are not typically accessible. EHRs contain next-of-kin information collected via patient emergency contact forms, but until now, these data have gone unused in research. We mined emergency contact data at three academic medical centers and identified 7.4 million familial relationships while maintaining patient privacy. Identified relationships were consistent with genetically derived relatedness. We used EHR data to compute heritability estimates for 500 disease phenotypes. Overall, estimates were consistent with the literature and between sites. Inconsistencies were indicative of limitations and opportunities unique to EHR research. These analyses provide a validation of the use of EHRs for genetics and disease research.",

However, it is unknown whether health care organizations follow this recommendation or what rationales drive their decisions. To address this gap, we conducted an electronic survey via 2 national listservs. Among 167 inpatient and outpatient study facilities using EHR systems designed to open multiple records at once, 44.3% were configured to allow \u22653 records open at once (unrestricted), 38.3% allowed only 1 record open (restricted), and 17.4% allowed 2 records open (hedged). Decision-making centered on efforts to balance safety and efficiency, but there was disagreement among organizations about how to achieve that balance. Results demonstrate no consensus on the number of records to be allowed open at once in EHRs. Rigorous studies are needed to determine the optimal number of records that balances safety and efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Prevention of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in acute-care hospitals is a priority for hospitals and clinicians. We performed a qualitative systematic review to update the evidence on interventions to prevent CDI published since 2009. DESIGN We searched Ovid, MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, CINAHL, the ISI Web of Knowledge, and grey literature databases from January 1, 2009 to August 1, 2015. SETTING We included studies performed in acute-care hospitals. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS We included studies conducted on hospitalized patients that investigated the impact of specific interventions on CDI rates. INTERVENTIONS We used the QI-Minimum Quality Criteria Set (QI-MQCS) to assess the quality of included studies. Interventions were grouped thematically: environmental disinfection, antimicrobial stewardship, hand hygiene, chlorhexidine bathing, probiotics, bundled approaches, and others. A meta-analysis was performed when possible. RESULTS Of 3,236 articles screened, 261 met the criteria for full-text review and 46 studies were ultimately included. The average quality rating was 82% according to the QI-MQCS. The most effective interventions, resulting in a 45% to 85% reduction in CDI, included daily to twice daily disinfection of high-touch surfaces (including bed rails) and terminal cleaning of patient rooms with chlorine-based products. Bundled interventions and antimicrobial stewardship showed promise for reducing CDI rates. Chlorhexidine bathing and intensified hand-hygiene practices were not effective for reducing CDI rates. CONCLUSIONS Daily and terminal cleaning of patient rooms using chlorine-based products were most effective in reducing CDI rates in hospitals. Further studies are needed to identify the components of bundled interventions that reduce CDI rates. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2017;38:476-482.",

        "Abstract": "We present a pre/post intervention study, where HARVEST, a general-purpose patient record summarization tool, was introduced to ten data abstraction specialists. The specialists are responsible for reviewing hundreds of patient charts each month and reporting disease-specific quality metrics to a variety of online registries and databases. We qualitatively and quantitatively investigated whether HARVEST improved the process of quality metric abstraction. Study instruments included pre/post questionnaires and log analyses of the specialists' actions in the electronic health record (EHR). The specialists reported favorable impressions of HARVEST and suggested that it was most useful when abstracting metrics from patients with long hospitalizations and for metrics that were not consistently captured in a structured manner in the EHR. A statistically significant reduction in time spent per chart before and after use of HARVEST was observed for 50% of the specialists and 90% of the specialists continue to use HARVEST after the study period.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical data warehouses, initially directed towards clinical research or financial analyses, are evolving to support quality improvement efforts, and must now address the quality improvement life cycle. In addition, data that are needed for quality improvement often do not reside in a single database, requiring easier methods to query data across multiple disparate sources. We created a virtual data warehouse at NewYork Presbyterian Hospital that allowed us to bring together data from several source systems throughout the organization. We also created a framework to match the maturity of a data request in the quality improvement life cycle to proper tools needed for each request. As projects progress in the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control stages of quality improvement, there is a proper matching of resources the data needs at each step. We describe the analysis and design creating a robust model for applying clinical data warehousing to quality improvement.",

NewYork-Presbyterian has designed and developed a real-time patient monitoring system that integrates vital signs sensors, networking, and electronic health records, to allow for automatic charting of patient status. We evaluate the representativeness (a combination of agreement, safety and timing) of a core vital sign across nursing intensity care protocols for preliminary feasibility assessment. Our findings suggest an automated way of summarizing heart rate provides representation of true heart rate status and can facilitate alternatives approaches to burdensome manual nurse charting of physiological parameters.",

However, internet access through traditional methods may be limited for populations most at risk for fragmented care. A convenience sample of postpartum women at a community hospital and tertiary-care academic center in New York City completed a self-administered survey. Most (75.2%, n = 200) women approached participated. The majority (70.0%) were Latina, 53.5% were Spanish speakers, 23.4% were uninsured, and 41.6% were publicly insured. Smartphone ownership (85.6%) including a data plan (80.0%) was high. While insurance and educational level were associated with decreased odds of internet access at home, access via cellphone only differed by age. Nearly all (94%) women wanted PHR access and interest only differed by language. Even the minority (20.0%) of women with concerns, reported high (93.8%) interest. High smartphone ownership, use of phone for internet access, and interest in PHR access, suggest the potential of optimizing PHR use via mobile technologies.",

While patient engagement has been a focus in the outpatient setting, strategies to engage inpatients in their care have not been well studied. We are undertaking a study to assess how patients' information needs during hospitalization can be addressed with health information technologies. To achieve this aim, we developed a personalized inpatient portal that allows patients to see who is on their care team, monitor their vital signs, review medications being administered, review current and historical lab and test results, confirm allergies, document pain scores and send questions and comments to inpatient care providers. The purpose of this paper is to describe the protocol for the study.",

        "Abstract": "The rapidly expanding use of electronic records in health-care settings is generating unprecedented quantities of data available for clinical, epidemiological, and cost-effectiveness research. Several challenges are associated with using these data for clinical research, including issues surrounding access and information security, poor data quality, inconsistency of data within and across institutions, and a paucity of staff with expertise to manage and manipulate large clinical data sets. In this article, we describe our experience with assembling a data-mart and conducting clinical research using electronic data from four facilities within a single hospital network in New York City. We culled data from several electronic sources, including the institution's admission-discharge-transfer system, cost accounting system, electronic health record, clinical data warehouse, and departmental records. The final data-mart contained information for more than 760,000 discharges occurring from 2006 through 2012. Using categories identified by the National Institutes of Health Big Data to Knowledge initiative as a framework, we outlined challenges encountered during the development and use of a domain-specific data-mart and recommend approaches to overcome these challenges.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to track and report long-term outcomes, especially mortality, is essential for advancing clinical research. The purpose of this study was to present a framework for assessing the quality of mortality information in clinical research databases. Using the clinical data warehouse (CDW) at Columbia University Medical Center as a case study, we measured: 1) agreement in vital status between our institution's patient registration system and the U.S. Social Security Administration's Death Master File (DMF), 2) the proportion of patients marked as deceased according to the DMF records who had subsequent visits to our institution, and 3) the proportion of patients still living according to Columbia's CDW who were over 100 and 120 years of age. Of 33,295 deaths recorded in our institution's patient registration system, 13,167 (39.5%) did not exist in the DMF. Of 315,037 patients in our CDW who marked as deceased according to the DMF, 2.1% had a subsequent clinical encounter at our institution. The proportion of patients still living according to Columbia's CDW who were over 100 and 120 years of age was 43.6% and 43.1%, respectively. These measures may be useful to other clinical research investigators seeking to assess the quality of mortality data (1-4).",

The primary innovation of RedX was the electronic health record view of patient data, to provide better contextual understanding for non-technical users in building complex data queries. The design of RedX around this need identified multiple functions that would use individual patient views to better understand population-based data, and vice-versa. During development, the more necessary and valuable components of RedX were refined, leading to a functional self-service query and cohort identification tool. However, with the improved capabilities and extensibility of other applications for data querying and navigation, our long-term implementation and dissemination plans have moved towards consolidation and alignment of RedX functions as enhancements in these other initiatives.",

To investigate on an international scale the current state of approaches for providing patients with access to their own clinical information, individuals from 16 countries, across six continents, participated in cross-sectional semi-structured interviews. Interview questions focused on social and cultural influences that affected patient engagement activities, government support for current and planned initiatives, data ownership models, and technical issues. Substantive initiatives for providing information to patients in the majority of countries interviewed are present; however, these initiatives were diverse in nature and stage of implementation. Efforts to improve patient access to data are active on a global-scale. There are many open questions about best practices and much can be learned by adopting an international perspective to guide future implementation efforts.",

Most doses are generally administered early in the influenza season, yet sustained vaccination efforts are crucial for achieving optimal coverage. The impact of text message influenza vaccination reminders was recently demonstrated in a low-income population. Little is known about their effect on children with delayed influenza vaccination or the most effective message type.",

        "Abstract": "Family history is considered a core element of clinical care. In this study we assessed the quality of family history data captured in an established commercial electronic health record (EHR) at a large academic medical center. Because the EHR had no centralized location to store family history information, it was collected as part of clinical notes in structured or free-text format. We analyzed differences between 10,000 free-text and 9,121 structured family history observations. Each observation was classified according to disease presence/absence and family member affected (e.g., father, mother, etc.). The structured notes did not collect a complete family history as defined by standards endorsed by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; the free-text notes contained more information than the structured notes, but still not enough to be considered \"complete.\" Several barriers remain for collecting complete, useful family history data in electronic health records.",

        "Abstract": "Communication and information sharing are critical parts of teamwork in the hospital; however, achieving open and fluid communication can be challenging. Finding specific patient information within documentation can be difficult. Recent studies on handoff documentation tools show that resident handoff notes are increasingly used as an alternative information source by non-physician clinicians. Previous findings also show that residents have become aware of this unintended use. This study investigated the alignment of resident note updating patterns and team note viewing patterns based on usage log data of handoff notes. Qualitative interviews with clinicians were used to triangulate findings based on the log analysis. The study found that notes that were frequently updated were viewed significantly more frequently than notes updated less often (p < 2.2 \u00d7 10(-16)). Almost 44% of all notes had aligned frequency of views and updates. The considerable percentage (56%) of mismatched note utilization suggests an opportunity for improvement.",

        "Abstract": "Recent research focused on online health information seeking highlights a heavy reliance on general-purpose search engines. However, current general-purpose search interfaces do not necessarily provide adequate support for non-experts in identifying suitable sources of health information. Popular search engines have recently introduced search tools in their user interfaces for a range of topics. In this work, we explore how such tools can support non-expert, patient-centered health information search. Scoping the current work to medication-related search, we report on findings from a formative study focused on the design of patient-centered, medication-information search tools. Our study included qualitative interviews with patients, family members, and domain experts, as well as observations of their use of Remedy, a technology probe embodying a set of search tools. Post-operative cardiothoracic surgery patients and their visiting family members used the tools to find information about their hospital medications and were interviewed before and after their use. Domain experts conducted similar search tasks and provided qualitative feedback on their preferences and recommendations for designing these tools. Findings from our study suggest the importance of four valuation principles underlying our tools: credibility, readability, consumer perspective, and topical relevance.",

        "Abstract": "For hospitalized patients, handoffs between providers affect continuity of care and increase the risk of medical errors. Most commercial electronic health record (EHR) systems lack dedicated tools to support patient handoff activities. We developed a collaborative application supporting patient handoff that is fully integrated with our commercial EHR. The application creates user-customizable printed reports with automatic inclusion of a variety of EHR data, including: allergies, medications, 24-hour vital signs, recent common laboratory test results, isolation requirements, and code status. It has achieved widespread voluntary use at our institution (6,100 monthly users; 700 daily reports generated), and we have distributed the application to several other institutions using the same EHR. Though originally designed for resident physicians, today about 50% of the application users are nurses, 40% are physicians/physician assistants/nurse practitioners, and 10% are pharmacists, social workers, and other allied health providers.",

Electronic health records (EHRs) are necessary to enable the Learning Health System; however, a source of frustration is that current systems fail to adequately support research needs.

        "Abstract": "The patient problem list, like administrative claims data, has become an important source of data for decision support, patient cohort identification, and alerting systems. A two-fold intervention to increase capture of problems on the problem list automatically - with minimal disruption to admitting and provider billing workflows - is described. For new patients with no prior data in the electronic health record, the intervention resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of problems recorded to the problem list (3.8 vs 2.9 problems post-and pre-intervention respectively, p value 2\u00d710(-16)). The majority of problems were recorded in the first 24 hours of admission. The proportion of patients with at least one problem coded to the problem list within the first 24 hours increased from 94% to 98% before and after intervention (chi square 344, p value 2\u00d710(-16)). ICD9 \"V codes\" connoting circumstances beyond disease were captured at a higher rate post intervention than before. Deyo/Charlson comorbidities derived from problem list data were more similar to those derived from claims data after the intervention than before (Jaccard similarity 0.3 post- vs 0.21 pre-intervention, p value 2\u00d710(-16)). A workflow-sensitive, non-interruptive means of capturing provider-entered codes early in admission can improve both the quantity and content of problems on the patient problem list.",

We conducted two experiments to better understand clinician and patient perceptions about giving patients access to their medical records during hospital encounters. The first experiment, a survey of physicians, nurses, and other care providers (N=53), showed that most respondents were comfortable with the idea of providing patients with their clinical information. Some expressed reservations that patients might misunderstand information and become unnecessarily alarmed or offended. In the second experiment, we provided eight hospital patients with a daily copy of their full medical record-including physician notes and diagnostic test results. From semi-structured interviews with seven of these patients, we found that they perceived the information as highly useful even if they did not fully understand complex medical terms. Our results suggest that increased patient information sharing in the inpatient setting is beneficial and desirable to patients, and generally acceptable to clinicians.",

        "Abstract": "Between 2008 and 2010, our academic medical center transitioned to electronic provider documentation using a commercial electronic health record system. For attending physicians, one of the most frustrating aspects of this experience was the system's failure to support their existing electronic billing workflow. Because of poor system integration, it was difficult to verify the supporting documentation for each bill and impractical to track whether billable notes had corresponding charges. We developed and deployed in 2011 an integrated billing application called \"iCharge\" that streamlines clinicians' documentation and billing workflow, and simultaneously populates the inpatient problem list using billing diagnosis codes. Each month, over 550 physicians use iCharge to submit approximately 23,000 professional service charges for over 4,200 patients. On average, about 2.5 new problems are added to each patient's problem list. This paper describes the challenges and benefits of workflow integration across disparate applications and presents an example of innovative software development within a commercial EHR framework.",

We investigated the information needs of emergency medicine clinicians in order to design an electronic dashboard to fill information gaps in the emergency department. An online survey was distributed to all emergency medicine physicians at a large, urban academic medical center. The survey response rate was 48% (52/109). The clinical information items reported to be most helpful while caring for patients in the emergency department were vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) reports, previous discharge summaries, and previous lab results. Brief structured interviews were also conducted with 18 clinicians during their shifts in the emergency department. From the interviews, three themes emerged: 1) difficulty accessing vital signs, 2) difficulty accessing point-of-care tests, and 3) difficulty comparing the current ECG with the previous ECG. An emergency medicine clinical dashboard was developed to address these difficulties.",

        "Abstract": "Handoffs are a critical component of coordinated patient care; however, poor handoffs have been associated with near misses and adverse events. To address this, national agencies have recommended standardizing handoffs, for example through the use of handoff documentation tools. Recent research suggests that handoff tools, typically designed for physicians, are often used by non-physician providers as information sources. In this study, we investigated patterns of edits of an electronic handoff tool in a large teaching hospital through examination of its usage log data. Qualitative interviews with clinicians were used to triangulate log data findings. The analysis showed that despite its primary focus on facilitating transitions of care, information in the handoff documentation tool was updated throughout the day. Interviews with residents confirmed that they purposefully updated information to make it available for other members of their patient care teams. This further reiterates the view of electronic handoff tools as facilitators of team communication and coordination. However, the study also showed considerable variability in the frequency of updates between different units and across different patients. Further research is required to understand what factors drive such diversity in the use of electronic handoff tool and whether this diversity can be used to make inferences about patients' conditions.",

The system, known as EzVac, has been operational since 1998 and now includes information on 2 million immunizations administered to more than 260,000 individuals. The system exchanges data with multiple electronic health records, a public health immunization registry, and a standalone personal health record. EzVac modules have recently been incorporated into the OpenMRS application and are being used to enhance immunization efforts in developing nations. We report on our experience with developing and using the EzVac system for 1) clinical care, both in local and global settings, 2) public health reporting, 3) consumer engagement, and 4) clinical and informatics research. We emphasize the advantages of using health IT standards to facilitate immunization information exchange in each of these domains.",

        "Abstract": "Use of electronic alerts in clinical practice has had mixed effects on providers' prescribing practices. Little research has explored the use of electronic alerts for improving screening practices. New York City has one of the highest rates of HIV in the United States. Recent New York State legislation requires healthcare providers to offer an HIV test to patients aged 13-64 years during a clinical encounter. Adhering to this requirement is particularly challenging in emergency department (ED) settings, which are frequently overcrowded and under-resourced. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of an electronic \"hard-stop\" alert on HIV testing rates in the ED. Approximately four months of data were reviewed before and after the implementation of the alert. We found that use of the electronic alert significantly increased documentation of offering an HIV test (O.R. = 267.27, p&lt;0.001) and resulted in a significant increase in HIV testing. Findings from this study add to the current knowledge about the use of electronic alertsfor improving disease screening.",

        "Abstract": "Nurses alter their monitoring behavior as a patient's clinical condition deteriorates, often detecting and documenting subtle changes before physiological trends are apparent. It was hypothesized that a nurse's behavior of recording optional documentation (beyond what is required) reflects concern about a patient's status and that mining data from patients' electronic health records for the presence of these features could help predict patients' mortality.",

EHR vendors seldom provide analytic tools for customers to maintain such content and monitor its usage. We developed an application for tracking order sets, documentation templates and clinical alerts in a commercial electronic health record. Using the application, we compared trends in order set creation and usage at two academic medical centers over a three-year period. In January 2012, one medical center had 873 order sets available to clinicians; the other had 787. Approximately 50-75 new order sets were added each year at each medical center. We found that 46% of order sets at the first medical center and 39% at the second medical center were unused over the three-year period.",

        "Abstract": "Much of what is currently documented in the electronic health record is in response toincreasingly complex and prescriptive medicolegal, reimbursement, and regulatory requirements. These requirements often result in redundant data capture and cumbersome documentation processes. AMIA's 2011 Health Policy Meeting examined key issues in this arena and envisioned changes to help move toward an ideal future state of clinical data capture and documentation. The consensus of the meeting was that, in the move to a technology-enabled healthcare environment, the main purpose of documentation should be to support patient care and improved outcomes for individuals and populations and that documentation for other purposes should be generated as a byproduct of care delivery. This paper summarizes meeting deliberations, and highlights policy recommendations and research priorities. The authors recommend development of a national strategy to review and amend public policies to better support technology-enabled data capture and documentation practices.",

        "Abstract": "Influenza infection results in substantial costs, morbidity, and mortality. Vaccination against influenza is particularly important in children and adolescents who are a significant source of transmission to other high-risk populations, yet pediatric and adolescent vaccine coverage remains low. Traditional vaccine reminders have had a limited effect on low-income populations; however, text messaging is a novel, scalable approach to promote influenza vaccination.",

        "Abstract": "As patients are encouraged to become active participants in their own care, recent research has begun to explore the direct sharing of electronic health information with patients during hospital visits. The design of patient-facing views of clinical information is, however, a relatively recent line of inquiry. Research is needed to further understand guidelines for communicating specific types of information to hospital patients. In this work, we focus on cardiology patients' information needs related to their hospital medications. We assessed these needs to inform the design of interactive, electronic views of medication information for cardiology inpatients. We present results of in-situ interviews with 11 inpatients and 6 nurses in a cardiology step-down unit. Our findings suggest that cohesive trends in medication information needs exist across cardiology inpatients. We discuss interview results and their implications for the design of inpatient-facing information technology. We also discuss key ways in which electronic medication information, formatted for inpatient use, differs from that formatted for outpatient or transitional medication-management use.",

        "Abstract": "Adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to assist with clinical reasoning and streamline workflow; however, the data entry and review capabilities of most systems are suboptimal which may lead to workarounds. As an instance of a workaround, we examined nurses' use of optional free-text comments in EHR flowsheets to support clinical needs for data interpretation. This mixed-method study included: 1) Content analysis of comments, 2) Interviews with nurses. We performed a sub-analysis of flowsheet data for 201 patients that experienced a cardiac arrest and interviewed 5 acute care nurses. We found that nurses used workarounds in the EHR - despite the extra effort that they required - to convey clinically significant relationships and to communicate concerning events to physicians. EHRs should better support entry of clinical data that \"belongs together\" and enable messaging capabilities integrated with nurses' flowsheet documentation workflow.",

While patients exhibited varying levels of comfort with using the tablet computer, they were highly enthusiastic about the application's ability to supply health information such as their inpatient medication histories and photographs of their care providers.

        "Abstract": "Clinical documents frequently contain a list of a patient's medications. Missing information about the dosage, route, or frequency of a medication impairs clinical communication and may harm patients. We examined 253 medication lists. There were 181 lists (72%) with at least one medication missing a dose, route, or frequency. Missing information was judged to be potentially harmful in 47 of the lists (19% of 253) by three physician reviewers (kappa=0.69). We also observed that many lists contained additional information included as annotations, prompting a secondary thematic analysis of the annotations. Fifty-five of the 253 lists (22%) contained one or more annotations. The most frequent types of annotations were comments about the patient's medical history, the clinician's treatment plan changes, and the patient's adherence to a medication. Future development of electronic medication reconciliation tools to improve medication list completeness should also support annotating the medication list in a flexible manner.",

        "Abstract": "Historically, short \u2018comments\u2019 on paper-based flowsheets conveyed the patient's overall clinical state. We analyzed the content and documentation patterns of electronic health record flowsheets for 201 cardiac arrest patients. Free-text comments were associated with the abnormality of clinical measurements (p<0.05). The documentation of 3 or more comments for acute care patients was associated with a greater likelihood of dying by discharge (p<0.01). Documentation of ICU vital signs greater than the minimum hourly requirement was associated with increased survival of a cardiac arrest (p<0.05). Further analysis of such patterns may be useful for the measurement of nursing knowledge and surveillance activities, interdisciplinary communication tools, and clinical decision making.",

        "Abstract": "Despite being at highest risk for 2009 H1N1 virus morbidity and mortality, many children were not immunized with the vaccine. Identification of factors that put certain children at higher risk for under-immunization could reveal populations who may need to be specifically targeted for vaccination interventions in future pandemics. Little is known about the prevalence of, or factors associated with, 2009 H1N1 vaccine coverage in low-income, urban pediatric populations. This study evaluated 2009 H1N1 vaccination coverage in 19,643 children aged 6months to 18years receiving care at one of five community clinics associated with an academic medical center in a low-income community. Any (\u22651 dose) and full coverage (1 dose for children \u226510years old, 2 doses for those <10years) was determined as of December 1, 2009 and the end of vaccination period (June 30, 2010). Multivariable analyses were used to assess the impact of race/ethnicity, age, insurance, gender, and language on vaccine coverage and timeliness. By December 1, only 16.6% of children had received one dose, and 5.3% had full coverage. By the end of the vaccination period, 36.2% had received at least one H1N1 dose and 23.6% had full coverage. On multivariable analysis, older age, minority race/ethnicity, and private insurance were negatively associated with vaccination by December 1 and end of vaccination period, even after accounting for attendance at a clinic visit. In future pandemics, when timely receipt of a new vaccine in large populations may be imperative, general vaccination programs as well as special targeted education and vaccine reminders for these at risk groups may be warranted.",

        "Abstract": "Many hospitals have experienced challenges with accomplishing the Joint Commission's National Patient Safety Goal for medication reconciliation. Our institution implemented a fully electronic process for performing and documenting medication reconciliation at hospital admission. The process used a commercial EHR and relied on a longitudinal medication list called the \"Outpatient Medication Profile\" (OMP). Clinician compliance with documenting medication reconciliation was difficult to achieve, but approached 100% after a \"hard-stop\" reminder was implemented. We evaluated the impact of the process at a large urban academic medical center. Before the new process was adopted, the average number of medications contained in the OMP for a patient upon admission was <2. One year after adoption, the average number had increased to 4.7, and there were regular updates made to the list. Updating the OMP was predominantly done by physicians, NPs, and PAs (94%), followed by nurses (5%) and pharmacists (1%).",

We calculated the frequencies of terms and term-combinations (n-grams) in these lists, and compared these data with a previously described clinical task model.

To address this problem, the Health Level 7 (HL7) Virtual Medical Record project (an open, international standards development effort) is developing community consensus on the clinical information exchanged between CDS engines and clinical information systems. As a part of this effort, the HL7 CDS Work Group embarked on a multinational, collaborative effort to identify a representative set of clinical data elements required for CDS. Based on an analysis of CDS systems from 20 institutions representing 4 nations, 131 data elements were identified as being currently utilized for CDS. These findings will inform the development of the emerging HL7 Virtual Medical Record standard and will facilitate the achievement of scalable, standards-based CDS.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To support collaboration and clinician-targeted decision support, electronic health records (EHRs) must contain accurate information about patients' care providers. The objective of this study was to evaluate two approaches for care provider identification employed within a commercial EHR at a large academic medical center. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of EHR data for 121 patients in two cardiology wards during a four-week period. System audit logs of chart accesses were analyzed to identify the clinicians who were likely participating in the patients' hospital care. The audit log data were compared with two functions in the EHR for documenting care team membership: 1) a vendor-supplied module called \"Care Providers\", and 2) a custom \"Designate Provider\" order that was created primarily to improve accuracy of the attending physician of record documentation. RESULTS: For patients with a 3-5 day hospital stay, an average of 30.8 clinicians accessed the electronic chart, including 10.2 nurses, 1.4 attending physicians, 2.3 residents, and 5.4 physician assistants. The Care Providers module identified 2.7 clinicians/patient (1.8 attending physicians and 0.9 nurses). The Designate Provider order identified 2.1 clinicians/patient (1.1 attending physicians, 0.2 resident physicians, and 0.8 physician assistants). Information about other members of patients' care teams (social workers, dietitians, pharmacists, etc.) was absent. CONCLUSIONS: The two methods for specifying care team information failed to identify numerous individuals involved in patients' care, suggesting that commercial EHRs may not provide adequate tools for care team designation. Improvements to EHR tools could foster greater collaboration among care teams and reduce communication-related risks to patient safety.",

Frequent handoffs of patient care, high acuity of patient illness, and the increasing amount of available data complicate information exchange.

        "Abstract": "Effective communication is essential to safe and efficient patient care. We aimed to understand the current patterns and perceptions of communication of common goals in the ICU using the distributed cognition and clinical communication space theoretical frameworks. We conducted a focus group and 5 interviews with ICU clinicians and observed 59.5 hours of interdisciplinary ICU morning rounds. Clinicians used a CIS/CPOE system and paper artifacts for documentation; yet, preferred verbal communication as a method of information exchange because they perceived that the documentation was often not updated or efficient for information retrieval. These perceptions that the CIS/CPOE is a \"shift behind\" may lead to a further reliance on verbal information exchange, which is a valuable clinical communication activity, yet, is subject to information loss. Electronic documentation tools that, in real time, capture information that is currently verbally communicated may increase the effectiveness of communication.",

The expense of developing the interface across systems was minimal, and it was successfully incorporated within the vendor EHR. Users consistently used the legacy data view while using the EHR; usage reached up to 50% of accessed data. Data showing concurrent increases in the use of the legacy data view and adoption of the new EHR suggests the method may improve adoption of the new system.",

At a healthcare institution comprising two large academic medical centers, a documentation management data mart and a custom, Web-accessible business intelligence application were developed to track the availability and usage of electronic documentation templates. For each medical center, template availability and usage trends were measured from November 2007 through February 2008. By February 2008, approximately 65,000 electronic notes were authored per week on the two campuses. One site had 934 available templates, with 313 being used to author at least one note. The other site had 765 templates, of which 480 were used. The most commonly used template at both campuses was a free text note called \"Miscellaneous Nursing Note,\" which accounted for 33.3% of total documents generated at one campus and 15.2% at the other.",
