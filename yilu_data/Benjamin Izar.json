        "Abstract": "Immunotherapies have shown significant promise as an impactful strategy in cancer treatment. However, in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most prevalent primary brain tumor in adults, these therapies have demonstrated lower efficacy than initially anticipated. Consequently, there is an urgent need for strategies to enhance the effectiveness of immune treatments. AURKA has been identified as a potential drug target for GBM treatment. An analysis of the GBM cell transcriptome following AURKA inhibition revealed a potential influence on the immune system. Our research revealed that AURKA influenced PD-L1 levels in various GBM model systems in vitro and in vivo. Disrupting AURKA function genetically led to reduced PD-L1 levels and increased MHC-I expression in both established and patient-derived xenograft GBM cultures. This process involved both transcriptional and non-transcriptional pathways, partly implicating GSK3\u03b2. Interfering with AURKA also enhanced NK-cell-mediated elimination of GBM by reducing PD-L1 expression, as evidenced in rescue experiments. Furthermore, using a mouse model that mimics GBM with patient-derived cells demonstrated that Alisertib decreased PD-L1 expression in living organisms. Combination therapy involving anti-PD-1 treatment and Alisertib significantly prolonged overall survival compared to vehicle treatment. These findings suggest that targeting AURKA could have therapeutic implications for modulating the immune environment within GBM cells.",

Here, we perform massively parallel base-editing screens to generate thousands of variants at gene loci annotated with known or potential clinical relevance. We discover a broad landscape of putative gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, including in PIK3CD and the gene encoding its regulatory subunit, PIK3R1, LCK, SOS1, AKT1 and RHOA. Base editing of PIK3CD and PIK3R1 variants in T cells with an engineered T cell receptor specific to a melanoma epitope or in different generations of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells demonstrates that discovered GOF variants, but not LOF or silent mutation controls, enhanced signaling, cytokine production and lysis of cognate melanoma and leukemia cell models, respectively. Additionally, we show that generations of CD19 CAR T cells engineered with PIK3CD GOF mutations demonstrate enhanced antigen-specific signaling, cytokine production and leukemia cell killing, including when benchmarked against other recent strategies.",

This occurs in approximately 5-10% of ICB-treated patients, but has not yet been described in the context of novel combination therapies. Here, we report a case of an 89-year-old patient with metastatic melanoma to the liver, lung and lymph nodes, who underwent treatment with Opdualag (combining anti-PD-1 nivolumab and anti-lymphocyte-activation gene 3 relatlimab ICBs), and developed pseudoprogression after two cycles of therapy. The patient experienced a radiographic increase in liver metastatic lesion size, but was found to have a subsequent reduction in these lesions. The patient has been on therapy for 18 months without evidence of disease progression and continues to be clinically well-appearing.",

        "Abstract": "Genomic instability can trigger cancer-intrinsic innate immune responses that promote tumor rejection. However, cancer cells often evade these responses by overexpressing immune checkpoint regulators, such as PD-L1. Here, we identify the SNF2-family DNA translocase SMARCAL1 as a factor that favors tumor immune evasion by a dual mechanism involving both the suppression of innate immune signaling and the induction of PD-L1-mediated immune checkpoint responses. Mechanistically, SMARCAL1 limits endogenous DNA damage, thereby suppressing cGAS-STING-dependent signaling during cancer cell growth. Simultaneously, it cooperates with the AP-1 family member JUN to maintain chromatin accessibility at a PD-L1 transcriptional regulatory element, thereby promoting PD-L1 expression in cancer cells. SMARCAL1 loss hinders the ability of tumor cells to induce PD-L1 in response to genomic instability, enhances anti-tumor immune responses and sensitizes tumors to immune checkpoint blockade in a mouse melanoma model. Collectively, these studies uncover SMARCAL1 as a promising target for cancer immunotherapy.",

        "Abstract": "Liver metastasis (LM) confers poor survival and therapy resistance across cancer types, but the mechanisms of liver-metastatic organotropism remain unknown. Here, through in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we found that Pip4k2c loss conferred LM but had no impact on lung metastasis or primary tumor growth. Pip4k2c-deficient cells were hypersensitized to insulin-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling and exploited the insulin-rich liver milieu for organ-specific metastasis. We observed concordant changes in PIP4K2C expression and distinct metabolic changes in 3,511 patient melanomas, including primary tumors, LMs and lung metastases. We found that systemic PI3K inhibition exacerbated LM burden in mice injected with Pip4k2c-deficient cancer cells through host-mediated increase in hepatic insulin levels; however, this circuit could be broken by concurrent administration of an SGLT2 inhibitor or feeding of a ketogenic diet. Thus, this work demonstrates a rare example of metastatic organotropism through co-optation of physiological metabolic cues and proposes therapeutic avenues to counteract these mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "The contribution of antitumor immunity to metastatic dormancy is poorly understood. Here we show that the long noncoding RNA Malat1 is required for tumor initiation and metastatic reactivation in mouse models of breast cancer and other tumor types. Malat1 localizes to nuclear speckles to couple transcription, splicing and mRNA maturation. In metastatic cells, Malat1 induces WNT ligands, autocrine loops to promote self-renewal and the expression of Serpin protease inhibitors. Through inhibition of caspase-1 and cathepsin G, SERPINB6B prevents gasdermin D-mediated induction of pyroptosis. In this way, SERPINB6B suppresses immunogenic cell death and confers evasion of T cell-mediated tumor lysis of incipient metastatic cells. On-target inhibition of Malat1 using therapeutic antisense nucleotides suppresses metastasis in a SERPINB6B-dependent manner. These results suggest that Malat1-induced expression of SERPINB6B can titrate pyroptosis and immune recognition at metastatic sites. Thus, Malat1 is at the nexus of tumor initiation, reactivation and immune evasion and represents a tractable and clinically relevant drug target.",

        "Abstract": "We previously reported the results of a randomized phase II trial (NCT02904954) in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were treated with either two preoperative cycles of the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab alone or combined with immunomodulatory doses of stereotactic radiation (DRT). The trial met its primary endpoint of major pathological response, which was significantly higher following DRT with no new safety signals. Here, we report on the prespecified secondary endpoint of disease-free survival (DFS) regardless of treatment assignment and the prespecified exploratory analysis of DFS in each arm of the trial. DFS at 2 and 3 years across patients in both arms of the trial were 73% (95% CI: 62.1-84.5) and 65% (95% CI: 52.5-76.9) respectively. For the exploratory endpoint of DFS in each arm of the trial, three-year DFS was 63% (95% CI: 46.0-80.4) in the durvalumab monotherapy arm compared to 67% (95% CI: 49.6-83.4) in the dual therapy arm. In addition, we report post hoc exploratory analysis of progression-free survival as well as molecular correlates of response and recurrence through high-plex immunophenotyping of sequentially collected peripheral blood and gene expression profiles from resected tumors in both treatment arms. Together, our results contribute to the evolving landscape of neoadjuvant treatment regimens for NSCLC and identify easily measurable potential biomarkers of response and recurrence.",

        "Abstract": "Spatial omics technologies can help identify spatially organized biological processes, but existing computational approaches often overlook structural dependencies in the data. Here, we introduce Smoother, a unified framework that integrates positional information into non-spatial models via modular priors and losses. In simulated and real datasets, Smoother enables accurate data imputation, cell-type deconvolution, and dimensionality reduction with remarkable efficiency. In colorectal cancer, Smoother-guided deconvolution reveals plasma cell and fibroblast subtype localizations linked to tumor microenvironment restructuring. Additionally, joint modeling of spatial and single-cell human prostate data with Smoother allows for spatial mapping of reference populations with significantly reduced ambiguity.",

        "Abstract": "Immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer, yet the underlying mechanisms are often unknown in many patients. Using single-cell transcriptomics analysis, we previously identified the co-stimulator CD58 as part of a cancer cell-intrinsic immune checkpoint resistance signature in patient melanoma tissue. We subsequently validated CD58 loss as a driver of immune evasion using a patient-derived co-culture model of cancer and cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in a pooled single-cell perturbation experiment, where we additionally observed concurrent upregulation of PD-L1 protein expression in melanoma cells with CD58 loss. In our most recent study, we uncovered the mechanisms of immune evasion mediated by CD58 loss, including impaired T cell activation and infiltration within tumors, as well as inhibitory signaling by PD-L1 via a shared regulator, CMTM6. Thus, cancer cell-intrinsic reduction of CD58 represents a multi-faceted determinant of immune evasion. Furthermore, its reciprocal interaction with PD-L1 via CMTM6 provides critical insights into how co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory immune cues are regulated.",

        "Abstract": "Melanoma brain metastases (MBM) are clinically challenging to treat and exhibit variable responses to immune checkpoint therapies. Prior research suggests that MBM exhibit poor tumor immune responses and are enriched in oxidative phosphorylation. Here, we report results from a multi-omic analysis of a large, real-world melanoma cohort. MBM exhibited lower interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3) scores and T cell-inflamed scores compared to primary cutaneous melanoma (PCM) or extracranial metastases (ECM), which was independent of tumor mutational burden. Among MBM, there were fewer computationally inferred immune cell infiltrates, which correlated with lower TNF and IL12B mRNA levels. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) revealed suppression of inflammatory responses and dendritic cell maturation pathways. MBM also demonstrated a higher frequency of pathogenic PTEN mutations and angiogenic signaling. Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) was enriched in MBM and negatively correlated with NK cell and B cell-associated transcriptomic signatures. Modulating metabolic or angiogenic pathways in MBM may improve responses to immunotherapy in this difficult-to-treat patient subset.",

        "Abstract": "Since the first approval for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for the treatment of cutaneous melanoma more than a decade ago, immunotherapy has completely transformed the treatment landscape of this chemotherapy-resistant disease. Combination regimens including ICIs directed against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) with anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) agents or, more recently, anti-lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) agents, have gained regulatory approvals for the treatment of metastatic cutaneous melanoma, with long-term follow-up data suggesting the possibility of cure for some patients with advanced disease. In the resectable setting, adjuvant ICIs prolong recurrence-free survival, and neoadjuvant strategies are an active area of investigation. Other immunotherapy strategies, such as oncolytic virotherapy for injectable cutaneous melanoma and bispecific T-cell engager therapy for HLA-A*02:01 genotype-positive uveal melanoma, are also available to patients. Despite the remarkable efficacy of these regimens for many patients with cutaneous melanoma, traditional immunotherapy biomarkers (ie, programmed death-ligand 1 expression, tumor mutational burden, T-cell infiltrate and/or microsatellite stability) have failed to reliably predict response. Furthermore, ICIs are associated with unique toxicity profiles, particularly for the highly active combination of anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 agents. The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a panel of experts to develop this clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of melanoma, including rare subtypes of the disease (eg, uveal, mucosal), with the goal of improving patient care by providing guidance to the oncology community. Drawing from published data and clinical experience, the Expert Panel developed evidence- and consensus-based recommendations for healthcare professionals using immunotherapy to treat melanoma, with topics including therapy selection in the advanced and perioperative settings, intratumoral immunotherapy, when to use immunotherapy for patients with ",

        "Abstract": "Mucosal melanoma remains a rare cancer with high mortality and a paucity of therapeutic options. This is due in significant part to its low incidence leading to limited patient access to expert care and downstream clinical/basic science data for research interrogation. Clinical challenges such as delayed and at times inaccurate diagnoses, and lack of consensus tumor staging have added to the suboptimal outcomes for these patients. Clinical trials, while promising, have been difficult to activate and accrue. While individual institutions and investigators have attempted to seek solutions to such problems, international, national, and local partnership may provide the keys to more efficient and innovative paths forward. Furthermore, a mucosal melanoma coalition would provide a potential network for patients and caregivers to seek expert opinion and advice. The Melanoma Research Foundation Mucosal Melanoma Meeting (December 16, 2022, New York, USA) highlighted the current clinical challenges faced by patients, providers, and scientists, identified current and future clinical trial investigations in this rare disease space, and aimed to increase national and international collaboration among the mucosal melanoma community in an effort to improve patient outcomes. The included proceedings highlight the clinical challenges of mucosal melanoma, global clinical trial experience, basic science advances in mucosal melanoma, and future directions, including the creation of shared rare tumor registries and enhanced collaborations.",

        "Abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells develop from CD34+ progenitors in a stage-specific manner defined by changes in cell surface receptor expression and function. Secondary lymphoid tissues, including tonsil, are sites of human NK cell development. Here we present new insights into human NK cell development in pediatric tonsil using cyclic immunofluorescence and imaging mass cytometry. We show that NK cell subset localization and interactions are dependent on NK cell developmental stage and tissue residency. NK cell progenitors are found in the interfollicular domain in proximity to cytokine-expressing stromal cells that promote proliferation and maturation. Mature NK cells are primarily found in the T-cell rich parafollicular domain engaging in cell-cell interactions that differ depending on their stage and tissue residency. The presence of local inflammation results in changes in NK cell interactions, abundance, and localization. This study provides the first comprehensive atlas of human NK cell development in secondary lymphoid tissue.",

To thoroughly characterize the temporal nature of antitumor immune responses, we developed a 34-parameter spectral flow cytometry panel and performed high-throughput analyses in critical contexts. We leveraged two distinct preclinical models that recapitulate cancer immunoediting (NPK-C1) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response (MC38), respectively, and profiled multiple relevant tissues at and around key inflection points of immune surveillance and escape and/or ICB response. Machine learning-driven data analysis revealed a pattern of KLRG1 expression that uniquely identified intratumoral effector CD4 T cell populations that constitutively associate with tumor burden across tumor models, and are lost in tumors undergoing regression in response to ICB.

        "Abstract": "The cell-autonomous balance of immune-inhibitory and -stimulatory signals is a critical process in cancer immune evasion. Using patient-derived co-cultures, humanized mouse models, and single-cell RNA-sequencing of patient melanomas biopsied before and on immune checkpoint blockade, we find that intact cancer cell-intrinsic expression of CD58 and ligation to CD2 is required for anti-tumor immunity and is predictive of treatment response. Defects in this axis promote immune evasion through diminished T\u00a0cell activation, impaired intratumoral T\u00a0cell infiltration and proliferation, and concurrently increased PD-L1 protein stabilization. Through CRISPR-Cas9 and proteomics screens, we identify and validate CMTM6 as critical for CD58 stability and upregulation of PD-L1 upon CD58 loss. Competition between CD58 and PD-L1 for CMTM6 binding determines their rate of endosomal recycling over lysosomal degradation. Overall, we describe an underappreciated yet critical axis of cancer immunity and provide a molecular basis for how cancer cells balance immune inhibitory and stimulatory cues.",

To thoroughly characterize the temporal nature of antitumor immune responses, we developed a 34-parameter spectral flow cytometry panel and performed high-throughput analyses in critical contexts. We leveraged two distinct preclinical models that recapitulate cancer immunoediting (NPK-C1) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response (MC38), respectively, and profiled multiple relevant tissues at and around key inflection points of immune surveillance and escape and/or ICB response. Machine learning-driven data analysis revealed a pattern of KLRG1 expression that uniquely identified intratumoral effector CD4 T cell populations that constitutively associate with tumor burden across tumor models, and are lost in tumors undergoing regression in response to ICB.

        "Abstract": "Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment but has yet to be translated into brain tumors. Studies in other solid tumors suggest a central role of B-cell immunity in driving immune-checkpoint-blockade efficacy. Using single-cell and single-nuclei transcriptomics of human glioblastoma and melanoma brain metastasis, we found that tumor-associated B-cells have high expression of checkpoint molecules, known to block B-cell-receptor downstream effector function such as plasmablast differentiation and antigen-presentation. We also identified TGF\u03b2-1/TGF\u03b2 receptor-2 interaction as a crucial modulator of B-cell suppression. Treatment of glioblastoma patients with pembrolizumab induced expression of B-cell checkpoint molecules and TGF\u03b2-receptor-2. Abrogation of TGF\u03b2 using different conditional knockouts expanded germinal-center-like intratumoral B-cells, enhancing immune-checkpoint-blockade efficacy. Finally, blocking \u03b1V\u03b28 integrin (which controls the release of active TGF\u03b2) and PD-1 significantly increased B-cell-dependent animal survival and immunological memory. Our study highlights the importance of intratumoral B-cell immunity and a remodeled approach to boost the effects of immunotherapy against brain tumors.",

        "Abstract": "The molecular underpinnings of organ dysfunction in acute COVID-19 and its potential long-term sequelae are under intense investigation. To shed light on these in the context of liver function, we performed single-nucleus RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic profiling of livers from 17 COVID-19 decedents. We identified hepatocytes positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA with an expression phenotype resembling infected lung epithelial cells. Integrated analysis and comparisons with healthy controls revealed extensive changes in the cellular composition and expression states in COVID-19 liver, reflecting hepatocellular injury, ductular reaction, pathologic vascular expansion, and fibrogenesis. We also observed Kupffer cell proliferation and erythrocyte progenitors for the first time in a human liver single-cell atlas, resembling similar responses in liver injury in mice and in sepsis, respectively. Despite the absence of a clinical acute liver injury phenotype, endothelial cell composition was dramatically impacted in COVID-19, concomitantly with extensive alterations and profibrogenic activation of reactive cholangiocytes and mesenchymal cells. Our atlas provides novel insights into liver physiology and pathology in COVID-19 and forms a foundational resource for its investigation and understanding.",

        "Abstract": "Uveal melanoma (UM) is associated with poor outcomes in the metastatic setting and harbors activating mutations resulting in upregulation of MAPK signaling in almost all cases. The efficacy of selumetinib, an oral allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/2, was limited when administered at a continual dosing schedule of 75 mg BID. Preclinical studies demonstrate that intermittent MEK inhibition reduces compensatory pathway activation and promotes T cell activation. We hypothesized that intermittent dosing of selumetinib would reduce toxicity, allow for the administration of increased doses, and achieve more complete pathway inhibition, thus resulting in improved antitumor activity.",

        "Abstract": "How cancer-associated chromatin abnormalities shape tumor-immune interaction remains incompletely understood. Recent studies have linked DNA hypomethylation and de-repression of retrotransposons to anti-tumor immunity through the induction of interferon response. Here, we report that inactivation of the histone H3K36 methyltransferase NSD1, which is frequently found in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and induces DNA hypomethylation, unexpectedly results in diminished tumor immune infiltration. In syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse models of head and neck SCCs, NSD1-deficient tumors exhibit immune exclusion and reduced interferon response despite high retrotransposon expression. Mechanistically, NSD1 loss results in silencing of innate immunity genes, including the type III interferon receptor IFNLR1, through depletion of H3K36 di-methylation (H3K36me2) and gain of H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3). Inhibition of EZH2 restores immune infiltration and impairs the growth of Nsd1-mutant tumors. Thus, our work uncovers a druggable chromatin cross talk that regulates the viral mimicry response and enables immune evasion of DNA hypomethylated tumors.",

Thus far, the roles of these ectopic epithelial cells in alveolar regeneration remain controversial. Here, we confirm that the ectopic tuft cells are originated from EBCs in mouse models and COVID-19 lungs. The differentiation of tuft cells from EBCs is promoted by Wnt inhibition while suppressed by Notch inhibition. Although progenitor functions have been suggested in other organs, pulmonary tuft cells don't proliferate or give rise to other cell lineages. Consistent with previous reports, ",

        "Abstract": "Melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) frequently occurs in patients with advanced melanoma; yet, our understanding of the underlying salient biology is rudimentary. Here, we performed single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq in 22 treatment-naive MBMs and 10 extracranial melanoma metastases (ECMs) and matched spatial single-cell transcriptomics and T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR)-seq. Cancer cells from MBM were more chromosomally unstable, adopted a neuronal-like cell state, and enriched for spatially variably expressed metabolic pathways. Key observations were validated in independent patient cohorts, patient-derived MBM/ECM xenograft models, RNA/ATAC-seq, proteomics, and multiplexed imaging. Integrated spatial analyses revealed distinct geography of putative cancer immune evasion and evidence for more abundant intra-tumoral B to plasma cell differentiation in lymphoid aggregates in MBM. MBM harbored larger fractions of monocyte-derived macrophages and dysfunctional TOX",

        "Abstract": "Melanoma-derived brain metastases (MBM) represent an unmet clinical need because central nervous system progression is frequently an end stage of the disease. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) provide a clinical opportunity against MBM; however, the MBM tumor microenvironment (TME) has not been fully elucidated in the context of ICI. To dissect unique elements of the MBM TME and correlates of MBM response to ICI, we collected 32 fresh MBM and performed single-cell RNA sequencing of the MBM TME and T-cell receptor clonotyping on T cells from MBM and matched blood and extracranial lesions. We observed myeloid phenotypic heterogeneity in the MBM TME, most notably multiple distinct neutrophil states, including an IL8-expressing population that correlated with malignant cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In addition, we observed significant relationships between intracranial T-cell phenotypes and the distribution of T-cell clonotypes intracranially and peripherally. We found that the phenotype, clonotype, and overall number of MBM-infiltrating T cells were associated with response to ICI, suggesting that ICI-responsive MBMs interact with peripheral blood in a manner similar to extracranial lesions. These data identify unique features of the MBM TME that may represent potential targets to improve clinical outcomes for patients with MBM.",

        "Abstract": "Immune responses to cancer are highly variable, with mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) tumors exhibiting more anti-tumor immunity than mismatch repair-proficient (MMRp) tumors. To understand the rules governing these varied responses, we transcriptionally profiled 371,223 cells from colorectal tumors and adjacent normal tissues of 28 MMRp and 34 MMRd individuals. Analysis of 88 cell subsets and their 204 associated gene expression programs revealed extensive transcriptional and spatial remodeling across tumors. To discover hubs of interacting malignant and immune cells, we identified expression programs in different cell types that co-varied across tumors from affected individuals and used spatial profiling to localize coordinated programs. We discovered a myeloid cell-attracting hub at the tumor-luminal interface associated with tissue damage and an MMRd-enriched immune hub within the tumor, with activated T\u00a0cells together with malignant and myeloid cells expressing T\u00a0cell-attracting chemokines. By identifying interacting cellular programs, we reveal the logic underlying spatially organized immune-malignant cell networks.",

        "Abstract": "Mucosal melanoma is a rare form of melanoma which arises from melanocytes in the mucosal membranes and can be effectively treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). However, response rates in mucosal melanoma are lower than those observed for cutaneous melanomas. Targeted sequencing of up to 447 genes (OncoPanel) was performed on tumors from all mucosal melanoma patients seen at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from 2011 until March 2019. We identified a total of 46 patients who received ICB with both tumor-genotype and ICB response data available. Within this cohort of patients, 16 (35%) had durable clinical benefit (DCB) to their first line of ICB. The average mutational burden/megabase was 6.23 and did not correlate with tumor response to ICB. Patients with KIT aberrations had a higher DCB rate compared with patients with wildtype KIT (71 vs. 28%), but this was not found to be statistically significant. For comparison, we analyzed tumor genotypes from an additional 50 mucosal melanoma tumors and 189 cutaneous melanoma tumors. The most frequent mutations in mucosal melanoma were in SF3B1 (27%), KIT (18%), and NF1 (17%), a pattern that is distinct from cutaneous melanomas. In addition, there were genetic differences observed based upon the site of origin of the mucosal melanoma. Our findings explore clinical features of response in patients with mucosal melanoma treated with ICB and demonstrate a low mutational burden that does not correlate with response. In addition, the lack of significant association between the genetic aberrations tested and response to ICB indicates the need for further exploration in this patient population.",

        "Abstract": "Resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is a key challenge in cancer therapy. To elucidate underlying mechanisms, we developed Perturb-CITE-sequencing (Perturb-CITE-seq), enabling pooled clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 perturbations with single-cell transcriptome and protein readouts. In patient-derived melanoma cells and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) co-cultures, we profiled transcriptomes and 20\u2009proteins in ~218,000\u2009cells under ~750\u2009perturbations associated with cancer cell-intrinsic ICI resistance (ICR). We recover known mechanisms of resistance, including defects in the interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3)-JAK/STAT and antigen-presentation pathways in RNA, protein and perturbation space, and new ones, including loss/downregulation of CD58. Loss of CD58 conferred immune evasion in multiple co-culture models and was downregulated in tumors of melanoma patients with ICR. CD58 protein expression was not induced by IFN-\u03b3 signaling, and CD58 loss conferred immune evasion without compromising major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, suggesting that it acts orthogonally to known mechanisms of ICR. This work provides a framework for the deciphering of complex mechanisms by large-scale perturbation screens with multimodal, single-cell readouts, and discovers potentially clinically relevant mechanisms of immune evasion.",

        "Abstract": "Synovial sarcoma (SyS) is an aggressive neoplasm driven by the SS18-SSX fusion, and is characterized by low T cell infiltration. Here, we studied the cancer-immune interplay in SyS using an integrative approach that combines single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial profiling and genetic and pharmacological perturbations. scRNA-seq of 16,872 cells from 12 human SyS tumors uncovered a malignant subpopulation that marks immune-deprived niches in situ and is predictive of poor clinical outcomes in two independent cohorts. Functional analyses revealed that this malignant cell state is controlled by the SS18-SSX fusion, is repressed by cytokines secreted by macrophages and T cells, and can be synergistically targeted with a combination of HDAC and CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors. This drug combination enhanced malignant-cell immunogenicity in SyS models, leading to induced T cell reactivity and T cell-mediated killing. Our study provides a blueprint for investigating heterogeneity in fusion-driven malignancies and demonstrates an interplay between immune evasion and oncogenic processes that can be co-targeted in SyS and potentially in other malignancies.",

        "Abstract": "Cytosolic DNA is characteristic of chromosomally unstable metastatic cancer cells, resulting in constitutive activation of the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway. How tumors co-opt inflammatory signaling while evading immune surveillance remains unknown. Here, we show that the ectonucleotidase ENPP1 promotes metastasis by selectively degrading extracellular cGAMP, an immune-stimulatory metabolite whose breakdown products include the immune suppressor adenosine. ENPP1 loss suppresses metastasis, restores tumor immune infiltration, and potentiates response to immune checkpoint blockade in a manner dependent on tumor cGAS and host STING. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type ENPP1, but not an enzymatically weakened mutant, promotes migration and metastasis, in part through the generation of extracellular adenosine, and renders otherwise sensitive tumors completely resistant to immunotherapy. In human cancers, ENPP1 expression correlates with reduced immune cell infiltration, increased metastasis, and resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Thus, cGAMP hydrolysis by ENPP1 enables chromosomally unstable tumors to transmute cGAS activation into an immune-suppressive pathway. SIGNIFICANCE: Chromosomal instability promotes metastasis by generating chronic tumor inflammation. ENPP1 facilitates metastasis and enables tumor cells to tolerate inflammation by hydrolyzing the immunotransmitter cGAMP, preventing its transfer from cancer cells to immune cells.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have shown that deep learning is capable of classifying dermatoscopic images at least as well as dermatologists. However, many studies in skin cancer classification utilize non-biopsy-verified training images. This imperfect ground truth introduces a systematic error, but the effects on classifier performance are currently unknown. Here, we systematically examine the effects of label noise by training and evaluating convolutional neural networks (CNN) with 804 images of melanoma and nevi labeled either by dermatologists or by biopsy. The CNNs are evaluated on a test set of 384 images by means of 4-fold cross validation comparing the outputs with either the corresponding dermatological or the biopsy-verified diagnosis. With identical ground truths of training and test labels, high accuracies with 75.03% (95% CI: 74.39-75.66%) for dermatological and 73.80% (95% CI: 73.10-74.51%) for biopsy-verified labels can be achieved. However, if the CNN is trained and tested with different ground truths, accuracy drops significantly to 64.53% (95% CI: 63.12-65.94%, ",

        "Abstract": "Single-cell genomics is essential to chart tumor ecosystems. Although single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) profiles RNA from cells dissociated from fresh tumors, single-nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq) is needed to profile frozen or hard-to-dissociate tumors. Each requires customization to different tissue and tumor types, posing a barrier to adoption. Here, we have developed a systematic toolbox for profiling fresh and frozen clinical tumor samples using scRNA-Seq and snRNA-Seq, respectively. We analyzed 216,490 cells and nuclei from 40 samples across 23 specimens spanning eight tumor types of varying tissue and sample characteristics. We evaluated protocols by cell and nucleus quality, recovery rate and cellular composition. scRNA-Seq and snRNA-Seq from matched samples recovered the same cell types, but at different proportions. Our work provides guidance for studies in a broad range of tumors, including criteria for testing and selecting methods from the toolbox for other tumors, thus paving the way for charting tumor atlases.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the success of immune checkpoint blockade as a strategy for activating an antitumor immune response and promoting cancer regression, only a subset of patients have durable clinical benefit. Efforts are ongoing to identify robust biomarkers that can effectively predict treatment response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Although PD-L1 expression is useful for stratifying patients, it is an imperfect tool. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing platforms that are readily used in clinical practice to identify a tumor's potentially actionable genetic alterations also reveal tumor genomic features, including tumor mutation burden (TMB), that may impact the response to ICIs. High TMB enhances tumor immunogenicity through increased numbers of tumor neoantigens that may promote an immune response. Defective DNA repair, leading to microsatellite instability, is an endogenous mechanism for increased tumor TMB that augments response to anti-PD-1 blockade. Alternatively, DNA damage from exogenous factors is responsible for high TMB seen in melanoma, lung cancer, and urothelial carcinoma, among tumor subtypes with higher response rates to ICIs. In this review, we summarize data supporting the use of TMB as a biomarker as well as its known limitations. We also highlight specific tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes that are under investigation as biomarkers for ICI response and resistance. Efforts are ongoing to delineate which genomic tumor characteristics can eventually be utilized in clinical practice to ascertain the benefit of ICIs for an individual patient.",

        "Abstract": "Crucial transitions in cancer-including tumor initiation, local expansion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance-involve complex interactions between cells within the dynamic tumor ecosystem. Transformative single-cell genomics technologies and spatial multiplex in situ methods now provide an opportunity to interrogate this complexity at unprecedented resolution. The Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Moonshot Initiative, will establish a clinical, experimental, computational, and organizational framework to generate informative and accessible three-dimensional atlases of cancer transitions for a diverse set of tumor types. This effort complements both ongoing efforts to map healthy organs and previous large-scale cancer genomics approaches focused on bulk sequencing at a single point in time. Generating single-cell, multiparametric, longitudinal atlases and integrating them with clinical outcomes should help identify novel predictive biomarkers and features as well as therapeutically relevant cell types, cell states, and cellular interactions across transitions. The resulting tumor atlases should have a profound impact on our understanding of cancer biology and have the potential to improve cancer detection, prevention, and therapeutic discovery for better precision-medicine treatments of cancer patients and those at risk for cancer.",

New drugs that control tumor growth and favorably modulate the immune environment are therefore needed. We report that the small-molecule CX-6258 has potent activity against both RMi-sensitive (RMS) and -resistant (RMR) melanoma cell lines. Haspin kinase (HASPIN) was identified as a target of CX-6258. HASPIN inhibition resulted in reduced proliferation, frequent formation of micronuclei, recruitment of cGAS, and activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. In murine models, CX-6258 induced a potent cGAS-dependent type-I IFN response in tumor cells, increased IFN\u03b3-producing CD8",

        "Abstract": "The use of either immune checkpoint blockade or RAF/MEK inhibitors represents standard of care treatment options for metastatic melanoma. Each class of these drugs has distinct response kinetics, adverse effects, and unique clinical challenges. Combination of immune checkpoint blockade and RAF/MEK inhibitors may result in rapid and durable responses, however, the potential adverse effects of such combinations are poorly characterized. Here, we describe the case of a patient with BRAF-mutant melanoma who received an initial infusion of anti-PD-1 therapy while taking RAF/MEK inhibitors and experienced severe acute kidney injury, an otherwise infrequent side effect of any of these drugs alone. Treatment with corticosteroids rapidly reversed this process, indicating an underlying immune-mediated complication. A deeper understanding of potential adverse effects of combination therapies and their potential mechanisms should be carefully considered in the treatment landscape for melanoma and other cancers.",

        "Abstract": "Multiplexed tissue imaging enables precise, spatially resolved enumeration and characterization of cell types and states in human resection specimens. A growing number of methods applicable to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections have been described, the majority of which rely on antibodies for antigen detection and mapping. This protocol provides step-by-step procedures for confirming the selectivity and specificity of antibodies used in fluorescence-based tissue imaging and for the construction and validation of antibody panels. Although the protocol is implemented using tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) as an imaging platform, these antibody-testing methods are broadly applicable. We demonstrate assembly of a 16-antibody panel for enumerating and localizing T cells and B cells, macrophages, and cells expressing immune checkpoint regulators. The protocol is accessible to individuals with experience in microscopy and immunofluorescence; some experience in computation is required for data analysis. A typical 30-antibody dataset for 20 FFPE slides can be generated within 2 weeks.",

Certain toxicities are associated with an increased response rate; however, the molecular underpinnings of this association are poorly understood. Here, we report a patient with wide spread uveal melanoma who had an exceptional response to treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab, but suffered severe immune-related sequelae, including central serous retinopathy with retinal detachment, tinnitus, and vitiligo resembling Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, and refractory enteritis. TCR-sequencing of the primary tumor, a hepatic metastasis, duodenal biopsy and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, identified the identical T cell clone in all four tissues. This case provides preliminary evidence for cross-reactivity as a mechanism for the association between effect and toxicity of ICIs.",

        "Abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) produce durable responses in some melanoma patients, but many patients derive no clinical benefit, and the\u00a0molecular underpinnings of such resistance remain\u00a0elusive. Here, we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from 33 melanoma tumors and computational analyses to interrogate malignant cell states that promote immune evasion. We identified a resistance program expressed by malignant cells that is associated with T\u00a0cell exclusion and immune evasion. The program is expressed prior to immunotherapy, characterizes cold niches in situ, and predicts clinical responses to anti-PD-1 therapy in an independent cohort of 112 melanoma patients. CDK4/6-inhibition represses this program in individual malignant cells, induces senescence, and reduces melanoma tumor outgrowth in mouse models in\u00a0vivo when given in combination with immunotherapy. Our study provides a high-resolution landscape of ICI-resistant cell states, identifies clinically predictive signatures, and suggests new therapeutic strategies to overcome immunotherapy resistance.",

        "Abstract": "The development of a new lesion in a patient with a complete remission to anti-PD-1 therapy is highly concerning for a drug resistant escape lesion. Here, we present a case of a 62-year-old patient with chemotherapy-resistant metastatic urothelial cancer who had a complete remission to pembrolizumab. The patient's disease burden tracked closely to serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) expressed by the tumor and served as an accurate tumor marker. Surveillance imaging revealed a solitary growing pulmonary nodule mimicking an escape lesion in the absence of an increase in AFP levels. Biopsy of this lesion revealed a benign intraparenchymal lymph node with no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. This case indicates that in some patients, biomarkers aberrantly expressed by their tumors, such as AFP in this patient, may be used as a tumor marker for response to anti-PD-1 therapy and emphasizes the importance of confirming potential escape lesions by pathologic examination.",

        "Abstract": "The architecture of normal and diseased tissues strongly influences the development and progression of disease as well as responsiveness and resistance to therapy. We describe a tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) method for highly multiplexed immuno-fluorescence imaging of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens mounted on glass slides, the most widely used specimens for histopathological diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. t-CyCIF generates up to 60-plex images using an iterative process (a cycle) in which conventional low-plex fluorescence images are repeatedly collected from the same sample and then assembled into a high-dimensional representation. t-CyCIF requires no specialized instruments or reagents and is compatible with super-resolution imaging; we demonstrate its application to quantifying signal transduction cascades, tumor antigens and immune markers in diverse tissues and tumors. The simplicity and adaptability of t-CyCIF makes it an effective method for pre-clinical and clinical research and a natural complement to single-cell genomics.",

        "Abstract": "To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), safety profile, and anti-tumor efficacy of RAF265. We conducted a multicenter, open-label, phase-I, dose-escalation trial of RAF265, an orally available RAF kinase/VEGFR-2 inhibitor, in patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma. Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, pharmacodynamics (PD) and tumor response assessment were conducted. We evaluated metabolic tumor response by 18[F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET), tissue biomarkers using immunohistochemistry (IHC), and modulators of angiogenesis. RAF265 has a serum half-life of approximately 200\u00a0h. The MTD was 48\u00a0mg once daily given continuously. Among 77 patients, most common treatment-related adverse effects were fatigue (52%), diarrhea (34%), weight loss (31%) and vitreous floaters (27%). Eight of 66 evaluable patients (12.1%) had an objective response, including seven partial and one complete response. Responses occurred in BRAF-mutant and BRAF wild-type (WT) patients. Twelve of 58 (20.7%) evaluable patients had a partial metabolic response. On-treatment versus pretreatment IHC staining in 23 patients showed dose-dependent p-ERK inhibition. We observed a significant temporal increase in placental growth factor levels and decrease in soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (sVEGFR-2) levels in all dose levels. RAF265 is an oral RAF/VEGFR-2 inhibitor that produced antitumor responses, metabolic responses, and modulated angiogenic growth factor levels. Antitumor activity occurred in patients with BRAF-mutant and BRAF-WT disease. Despite low activity at tolerable doses, this study provides a framework for the development of pan-RAF inhibitors and modulators of angiogenesis for the treatment of melanoma.",

        "Abstract": "Homeostatic programs balance immune protection and self-tolerance. Such mechanisms likely impact autoimmunity and tumor formation, respectively. How homeostasis is maintained and impacts tumor surveillance is unknown. Here, we find that different\u00a0immune mononuclear phagocytes share a conserved steady-state program during differentiation and entry into healthy tissue. IFN\u03b3 is necessary and sufficient to induce this program, revealing a key instructive role. Remarkably, homeostatic and IFN\u03b3-dependent programs enrich across primary human tumors, including melanoma, and stratify survival. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reveals enrichment of homeostatic modules in monocytes and DCs from human metastatic melanoma. Suppressor-of-cytokine-2 (SOCS2) protein, a conserved program transcript, is expressed by mononuclear phagocytes infiltrating primary melanoma and is induced by IFN\u03b3. SOCS2 limits adaptive anti-tumoral immunity and DC-based priming of T\u00a0cells in\u00a0vivo, indicating a critical regulatory role. These findings link immune homeostasis to key determinants of anti-tumoral immunity and escape, revealing co-opting of tissue-specific immune development in the tumor microenvironment.",

Conventional outcome measures, such as median progression-free and overall survival, may not be ideally suited to identify all patients who derive a benefit from such therapies. Therefore, the introduction of additional endpoint measures, such as milestone comparisons, may be necessary to characterize the potential benefit of such treatment approaches. Immune checkpoint inhibitors induce durable responses in a portion of patients that may continue after treatment cessation. Measuring the associated treatment-free interval, treatment-free survival, and associated patient-reported outcomes could provide important information when implemented in prospective clinical trials. In this article, we discuss the limitations of current endpoint measures and the potential advantage of using novel endpoints and how these might be used in designing clinical trials to address critical unanswered questions for patients with metastatic melanoma.",

        "Abstract": "Treatment of BRAF-mutant melanomas with MAP kinase pathway inhibitors is paradigmatic of the promise of precision cancer therapy but also highlights problems with drug resistance that limit patient benefit. We use live-cell imaging, single-cell analysis, and molecular profiling to show that exposure of tumor cells to RAF/MEK inhibitors elicits a heterogeneous response in which some cells die, some arrest, and the remainder adapt to drug. Drug-adapted cells up-regulate markers of the neural crest (e.g., NGFR), a melanocyte precursor, and grow slowly. This phenotype is transiently stable, reverting to the drug-na\u00efve state within 9\u00a0days of drug withdrawal. Transcriptional profiling of cell lines and human tumors implicates a c-Jun/ECM/FAK/Src cascade in de-differentiation in about one-third of cell lines studied; drug-induced changes in c-Jun and NGFR levels are also observed in xenograft and human tumors. Drugs targeting the c-Jun/ECM/FAK/Src cascade as well as BET bromodomain inhibitors increase the maximum effect (E",

        "Abstract": "Although human tumours are shaped by the genetic evolution of cancer cells, evidence also suggests that they display hierarchies related to developmental pathways and epigenetic programs in which cancer stem cells (CSCs) can drive tumour growth and give rise to differentiated progeny. Yet, unbiased evidence for CSCs in solid human malignancies remains elusive. Here we profile 4,347 single cells from six IDH1 or IDH2 mutant human oligodendrogliomas by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and reconstruct their developmental programs from genome-wide expression signatures. We infer that most cancer cells are differentiated along two specialized glial programs, whereas a rare subpopulation of cells is undifferentiated and associated with a neural stem cell expression program. Cells with expression signatures for proliferation are highly enriched in this rare subpopulation, consistent with a model in which CSCs are primarily responsible for fuelling the growth of oligodendroglioma in humans. Analysis of copy number variation (CNV) shows that distinct CNV sub-clones within tumours display similar cellular hierarchies, suggesting that the architecture of oligodendroglioma is primarily dictated by developmental programs. Subclonal point mutation analysis supports a similar model, although a full phylogenetic tree would be required to definitively determine the effect of genetic evolution on the inferred hierarchies. Our single-cell analyses provide insight into the cellular architecture of oligodendrogliomas at single-cell resolution and support the cancer stem cell model, with substantial implications for disease management.",

        "Abstract": "For the last five decades, measuring the ability of cells to grow in soft agar has served as the gold standard assay for in vitro cellular transformation. Nevertheless, the soft agar colony formation assay is time consuming and ill-suited for high-throughput screens. This unit describes an equally qualitative and quantitative assay known as growth in low attachment or GILA. The GILA assay is suitable for high-throughput pharmacological or genetic screens and allows the simultaneous examination of multiple cell lines and experimental perturbations. GILA conditions are specific and relevant to the transformed state because they depend on a property of cancer cells that is not shared by non-transformed cells. The GILA assay enables ex vivo drug sensitivity testing of patient-derived tumor cells to define precise treatments for individual patients. \u00a9 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

        "Abstract": "Early onset infection (EOI) in preterm infants <32\u00a0weeks gestational age (GA) is associated with a high mortality rate and the development of severe acute and long-term complications. The pathophysiology of EOI is not fully understood and clinical and laboratory signs of early onset infections in this patient cohort are often not conclusive. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify signatures characterizing preterm infants with EOI by using genome-wide gene expression (GWGE) analyses from umbilical arterial blood of preterm infants. This prospective cohort study was conducted in preterm infants <32\u00a0weeks GA. GWGE analyses using CodeLink human microarrays were performed from umbilical arterial blood of preterm infants with and without EOI. GWGE analyses revealed differential expression of 292 genes in preterm infants with EOI as compared to infants without EOI. Infants with EOI could be further differentiated into two subclasses and were distinguished by the magnitude of the expression of genes involved in both neutrophil and T cell activation. A hallmark activity for both subclasses of EOI was a common suppression of genes involved in natural killer (NK) cell function, which was independent from NK cell numbers. Significant results were recapitulated in an independent validation cohort. Gene expression profiling may enable early and more precise diagnosis of EOI in preterm infants.",

        "Abstract": "Tumor-stroma interactions are critical for epithelial-derived tumors, and among the stromal cell types, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) exhibit multiple functions that fuel growth, dissemination, and drug resistance. However, these interactions remain insufficiently characterized in non-epithelial tumors such as malignant melanoma. We generated monocultures of melanoma cells and matching CAFs from patients' metastatic lesions, distinguished by oncogenic drivers and immunoblotting of characteristic markers. RNA sequencing of CAFs revealed a homogenous epigenetic program that strongly resembled the signatures from epithelial cancers, including enrichment for an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Melanoma CAFs in monoculture displayed robust invasive behavior while patient-derived melanoma monocultures showed very little invasiveness. Instead, melanoma cells showed increased invasion when co-cultured with CAFs. In turn, CAFs showed increased proliferation when exposed to melanoma conditioned media (CM), mediated in part by melanoma-secreted transforming growth factor-alpha that acted on CAFs via the epidermal growth factor receptor. This study provides evidence that bidirectional interactions between melanoma and CAFs regulate progression of metastatic melanoma.",

        "Abstract": "To explore the distinct genotypic and phenotypic states of melanoma tumors, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to 4645 single cells isolated from 19 patients, profiling malignant, immune, stromal, and endothelial cells. Malignant cells within the same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, spatial context, and a drug-resistance program. In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion programs, their connection to T cell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability across patients. Overall, we begin to unravel the cellular ecosystem of tumors and how single-cell genomics offers insights with implications for both targeted and immune therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Colony formation in soft agar is the gold-standard assay for cellular transformation in vitro, but it is unsuited for high-throughput screening. Here, we describe an assay for cellular transformation that involves growth in low attachment (GILA) conditions and is strongly correlated with the soft-agar assay. Using GILA, we describe high-throughput screens for drugs and genes that selectively inhibit or increase transformation, but not proliferation. Such molecules are unlikely to be found through conventional drug screening, and they include kinase inhibitors and drugs for noncancer diseases. In addition to known oncogenes, the genetic screen identifies genes that contribute to cellular transformation. Lastly, we demonstrate the ability of Food and Drug Administration-approved noncancer drugs to selectively kill ovarian cancer cells derived from patients with chemotherapy-resistant disease, suggesting this approach may provide useful information for personalized cancer treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive human-pathogen bacterium that served as an experimental model for investigating fundamental processes of adaptive immunity and virulence. Recent novel technologies allowed the identification of several hundred non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the Listeria genome and provided insight into an unexpected complex transcriptional machinery. In this review, we discuss ncRNAs that are encoded on the opposite strand of the target gene and are therefore termed antisense RNAs (asRNAs). We highlight mechanistic and functional concepts of asRNAs in L. monocytogenes and put these in context of asRNAs in other bacteria. Understanding asRNAs will further broaden our knowledge of RNA-mediated gene regulation and may provide targets for diagnostic and antimicrobial development.",

Here, we report complete genome sequences for two L. monocytogenes strains belonging to serotype 4a (L99) and 4b (CLIP80459), and transcriptomes of representative strains from lineages I, II, and III, thereby permitting in-depth comparison of genome- and transcriptome -based data from three lineages of L. monocytogenes. Lineage III, represented by the 4a L99 genome is known to contain strains less virulent for humans.",

        "Abstract": "microRNAs represent a family of very small non-coding RNAs that control several physiologic and pathologic processes, including host immune response and cancer by antagonizing a number of target mRNAs. There is limited knowledge about cell expression and the regulatory role of microRNAs following bacterial infections. We investigated whether infection with a Gram-positive bacterium leads to altered expression of microRNAs involved in the host cell response in epithelial cells. Caco-2 cells were infected with Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e, a mutant strain (\u0394inlAB or \u0394hly) or incubated with purified listeriolysin (LLO). Total RNA was isolated and microRNA and target gene expression was compared to the expression in non-infected cells using microRNA microarrays and qRT-PCR. We identified and validated five microRNAs (miR- 146b, miR-16, let-7a1, miR-145 and miR-155) that were significantly deregulated following listerial infection. We show that expression patterns of particular microRNAs strongly depend on pathogen localization and the presence of bacterial effector proteins. Strikingly, miR-155 which was shown to have an important role in inflammatory responses during infection was induced by wild-type bacteria, by LLO-deficient bacteria and following incubation with purified LLO. It was downregulated following \u0394inlAB infection indicating a new potent role for internalins in listerial pathogenicity and miRNA regulation. Concurrently, we observed differences in target transcript expression of the investigated miRNAs. We provide first evidence that L. monocytogenes infection leads to deregulation of a set of microRNAs with important roles in host response. Distinct microRNA expression depends on both LLO and pathogen localization.",

        "Abstract": "Bacterial regulatory non-coding RNAs control numerous mRNA targets that direct a plethora of biological processes, such as the adaption to environmental changes, growth and virulence. Recently developed high-throughput techniques, such as genomic tiling arrays and RNA-Seq have allowed investigating prokaryotic cis- and trans-acting regulatory RNAs, including sRNAs, asRNAs, untranslated regions (UTR) and riboswitches. As a result, we obtained a more comprehensive view on the complexity and plasticity of the prokaryotic genome biology. Listeria monocytogenes was utilized as a model system for intracellular pathogenic bacteria in several studies, which revealed the presence of about 180 regulatory RNAs in the listerial genome. A regulatory role of non-coding RNAs in survival, virulence and adaptation mechanisms of L. monocytogenes was confirmed in subsequent experiments, thus, providing insight into a multifaceted modulatory function of RNA/mRNA interference. In this review, we discuss the identification of regulatory RNAs by high-throughput techniques and in their functional role in L. monocytogenes.",
