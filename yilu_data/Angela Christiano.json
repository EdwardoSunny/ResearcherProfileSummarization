        "Abstract": "We present Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Cell Therapy (DEBCT), a scalable platform producing autologous organotypic iPS cell-derived induced skin composite (iSC) grafts for definitive treatment. Clinical-grade manufacturing integrates CRISPR-mediated genetic correction with reprogramming into one step, accelerating derivation of COL7A1-edited iPS cells from patients. Differentiation into epidermal, dermal and melanocyte progenitors is followed by CD49f-enrichment, minimizing maturation heterogeneity. Mouse xenografting of iSCs from four patients with different mutations demonstrates disease modifying activity at 1 month. Next-generation sequencing, biodistribution and tumorigenicity assays establish a favorable safety profile at 1-9 months. Single cell transcriptomics reveals that iSCs are composed of the major skin cell lineages and include prominent holoclone stem cell-like signatures of keratinocytes, and the recently described Gibbin-dependent signature of fibroblasts. The latter correlates with enhanced graftability of iSCs. In conclusion, DEBCT overcomes manufacturing and safety roadblocks and establishes a reproducible, safe, and cGMP-compatible therapeutic approach to heal lesions of DEB patients.",

        "Abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is among the most prevalent autoimmune diseases, but the development of innovative therapeutic strategies has lagged due to an incomplete understanding of the immunological underpinnings of disease. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of skin-infiltrating immune cells from the graft-induced C3H/HeJ mouse model of AA, coupled with antibody-based depletion to interrogate the functional role of specific cell types in AA in vivo. Since AA is predominantly T cell-mediated, we focused on dissecting lymphocyte function in AA. Both our scRNAseq and functional studies established CD8+ T cells as the primary disease-driving cell type in AA. Only the depletion of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, NK, B, or \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, was sufficient to prevent and reverse AA. Selective depletion of regulatory T cells (T",

        "Abstract": "Sequencing-based approaches for the analysis of microbial communities are susceptible to contamination, which could mask biological signals or generate artifactual ones. Methods for in silico decontamination using controls are routinely used, but do not make optimal use of information shared across samples and cannot handle taxa that only partially originate in contamination or leakage of biological material into controls. Here we present Source tracking for Contamination Removal in microBiomes (SCRuB), a probabilistic in silico decontamination method that incorporates shared information across multiple samples and controls to precisely identify and remove contamination. We validate the accuracy of SCRuB in multiple data-driven simulations and experiments, including induced contamination, and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 15-20 times. We showcase the robustness of SCRuB across multiple ecosystems, data types and sequencing depths. Demonstrating its applicability to microbiome research, SCRuB facilitates improved predictions of host phenotypes, most notably the prediction of treatment response in melanoma patients using decontaminated tumor microbiome data.",

        "Abstract": "The mammalian gut is home to a diverse microbial ecosystem, whose composition affects various physiological traits of the host. Next-generation sequencing-based metagenomic approaches demonstrated how the interplay of host genetics, bacteria, and environmental factors shape complex traits and clinical outcomes. However, the role of fungi in these complex interactions remains understudied. Here, using 228 males and 363 females from an advanced-intercross mouse line, we provide evidence that fungi are regulated by host genetics. In addition, we map quantitative trait loci associated with various fungal species to single genes in mice using whole genome sequencing and genotyping. Moreover, we show that diet and its' interaction with host genetics alter the composition of fungi in outbred mice, and identify fungal indicator species associated with different dietary regimes. Collectively, in this work, we uncover an association of the intestinal fungal community with host genetics and a regulatory role of diet in this ecological niche.",

Therefore, approaches that effectively disrupt pathogenic T cell responses are predicted to have therapeutic benefit for AA treatment. T cells rely on the duality of T cell receptor (TCR) and gamma chain (\u03b3c) cytokine signaling for their development, activation, and peripheral homeostasis. Ifidancitinib is a potent and selective next-generation JAK1/3 inhibitor predicted to disrupt \u03b3c cytokine signaling. We found that Ifidancitinib robustly induced hair regrowth in AA-affected C3H/HeJ mice when fed with Ifidancitinib in chow diets. Skin taken from Ifidancitinib-treated mice showed significantly decreased AA-associated inflammation. CD44",

        "Abstract": "The primary forms of cicatricial (scarring) alopecia (PCA) are a group of inflammatory, irreversible hair loss disorders characterized by immune cell infiltrates targeting hair follicles (HFs). Lichen planopilaris (LPP), frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA), and centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) are among the main subtypes of PCAs. The pathogenesis of the different types of PCAs are poorly understood, and current treatment regimens yield inconsistent and unsatisfactory results. We performed high-throughput RNA-sequencing on scalp biopsies of a large cohort PCA patients to develop gene expression-based signatures, trained into machine-learning-based predictive models and pathways associated with dysregulated gene expression. We performed morphological and cytokine analysis to define the immune cell populations found in PCA subtypes. We identified a common PCA gene signature that was shared between LPP, FFA, and CCCA, which revealed a significant over-representation of mast cell (MC) genes, as well as downregulation of cholesterogenic pathways and upregulation of fibrosis and immune signaling genes. Immunohistological analyses revealed an increased presence of MCs in PCAs lesions. Our gene expression analyses revealed common pathways associated with PCAs, with a strong association with MCs. The indistinguishable differences in gene expression profiles and immune cell signatures between LPP, FFA, and CCCA suggest that similar treatment regimens may be effective in treating these irreversible forms of hair loss.",

        "Abstract": "An estimated 20-25% of the population is affected by chronic, non-communicable inflammatory skin diseases. Chronic skin inflammation has many causes. Among the most frequent chronic inflammatory skin diseases are atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, urticaria, lichen planus, and hidradenitis suppurativa, driven by a complex interplay of genetics and environmental factors. Autoimmunity is another important cause of chronic skin inflammation. The autoimmune response may be mainly T cell driven, such as in alopecia areata or vitiligo, or B cell driven in chronic spontaneous urticaria, pemphigus and pemphigoid diseases. Rare causes of chronic skin inflammation are autoinflammatory diseases, or rheumatic diseases, such as cutaneous lupus erythematosus or dermatomyositis. Whilst we have seen a significant improvement in diagnosis and treatment, several challenges remain. Especially for rarer causes of chronic skin inflammation, early diagnosis is often missed because of low awareness and lack of diagnostics. Systemic immunosuppression is the treatment of choice for almost all of these diseases. Adverse events due to immunosuppression, insufficient therapeutic responses and relapses remain a challenge. For atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, a broad spectrum of innovative treatments has been developed. However, treatment responses cannot be predicted so far. Hence, development of (bio)markers allowing selection of specific medications for individual patients is needed. Given the encouraging developments during the past years, we envision that many of these challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic inflammatory skin diseases will be thoroughly addressed in the future.",

Yet, to model whole-body physiology and systemic diseases, engineered tissues with preserved phenotypes need to physiologically communicate. Here we report the development and applicability of a tissue-chip system in which matured human heart, liver, bone and skin tissue niches are linked by recirculating vascular flow to allow for the recapitulation of interdependent organ functions. Each tissue is cultured in its own optimized environment and is separated from the common vascular flow by a selectively permeable endothelial barrier. The interlinked tissues maintained their molecular, structural and functional phenotypes over 4\u2009weeks of culture, recapitulated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of doxorubicin in humans, allowed for the identification of early miRNA biomarkers of cardiotoxicity, and increased the predictive values of clinically observed miRNA responses relative to tissues cultured in isolation and to fluidically interlinked tissues in the absence of endothelial barriers. Vascularly linked and phenotypically stable matured human tissues may facilitate the clinical applicability of tissue chips.",

        "Abstract": "Alopecia areata is a complex genetic disease that results in hair loss due to the autoimmune-mediated attack of the hair follicle. We previously defined a role for both rare and common variants in our earlier GWAS and linkage studies. Here, we identify rare variants contributing to Alopecia Areata using a whole exome sequencing and gene-level burden analyses approach on 849 Alopecia Areata patients compared to 15,640 controls. KRT82 is identified as an Alopecia Areata risk gene with rare damaging variants in 51 heterozygous Alopecia Areata individuals (6.01%), achieving genome-wide significance (p\u2009=\u20092.18E-07). KRT82 encodes a hair-specific type II keratin that is exclusively expressed in the hair shaft cuticle during anagen phase, and its expression is decreased in Alopecia Areata patient skin and hair follicles. Finally, we find that cases with an identified damaging KRT82 variant and reduced KRT82 expression have elevated perifollicular CD8 infiltrates. In this work, we utilize whole exome sequencing to successfully identify a significant Alopecia Areata disease-relevant gene, KRT82, and reveal a proposed mechanism for rare variant predisposition leading to disrupted hair shaft integrity.",

        "Abstract": "Unlike several other tumor types, prostate cancer rarely responds to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). To define tumor cell intrinsic factors that contribute to prostate cancer progression and resistance to ICB, we analyzed prostate cancer epithelial cells from castration-sensitive and -resistant samples using implanted tumors, cell lines, transgenic models and human tissue. We found that castration resulted in increased expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and its probable murine homolog Cxcl15 in prostate epithelial cells. We showed that these chemokines drove subsequent intratumoral infiltration of tumor-promoting polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs), which was largely abrogated when IL-8 signaling was blocked genetically or pharmacologically. Targeting IL-8 signaling in combination with ICB delayed the onset of castration resistance and increased the density of polyfunctional CD8 T cells in tumors. Our findings establish a novel mechanism by which castration mediates IL-8 secretion and subsequent PMN-MDSC infiltration, and highlight blockade of the IL-8/CXCR2 axis as a potential therapeutic intervention.",

However, it is unclear how immune signaling and sensory response pathways cross talk with each other. We differentiated itch sensory neuron-like cells (ISNLCs) from iPSC lines. These ISNLCs displayed neural markers and action potentials and responded specifically to itch-specific stimuli. These ISNLCs expressed receptors specific for IL-4/IL-13 and were activated directly by the two cytokines. We successfully innervated these ISNLCs into full thickness human skin constructs. These innervated skin grafts can be used in clinical applications such as wound healing. Moreover, the availability of such innervated skin models will be valuable to develop drugs to treat skin diseases such as AD.",

Limited studies have been performed examining the epidemiology of FFA and LPP. We performed a retrospective case cohort analysis by querying for patients with the ICD 10 code L66.1 (LPP, FFA) between 2015 and 2018 using the Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW) at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia Doctors. We calculated the one-year incidence of LPP/FFA between January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 by identifying all patients without a previously recorded ICD code for L66.1 who presented as a new hair loss patient based on chart review. A total of 170 patients were identified with a new diagnosis of LPP or FFA in 2018 among 1,187,583 patients. The standardized incidence per 100,000 was 12.75 for LPP and FFA combined, 7.35 for LPP alone, and 5.41 for FFA alone. The incidence peaked in the 51 to 60 age range (3.36). The incidence was highest in non-Hispanic White patients (17.27), White patients of unknown ethnicity (26.26), and non-Hispanic Asian patients (17.27). In New York City, LPP and FFA are uncommon diseases that are most common in middle-aged females and non-Hispanic White patients.",

        "Abstract": "Not all therapeutics are created equal in regards to individual patients. The problem of identifying which compound will work best with which patient is a significant burden across all disease contexts. In the context of autoimmune diseases such as alopecia areata, several formulations of JAK/STAT inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials. All of these compounds demonstrate different rates of response, and here we observed that this coincided with different molecular effects on patients undergoing treatment. Using these data, we have developed a computational model that is capable of predicting which patient-drug pairs have the highest likelihood of response. We achieved this by integrating inferred mechanism of action data and gene regulatory networks derived from an independent patient cohort with baseline patient data prior to beginning treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a rare genodermatosis caused by mutations in the gene coding for type VII collagen (COL7A1). More than 800 different pathogenic mutations in COL7A1 have been described to date; however, the ancestral origins of many of these mutations have not been precisely identified. In this study, 32 RDEB patient samples from the Southwestern United States, Mexico, Chile, and Colombia carrying common mutations in the COL7A1 gene were investigated to determine the origins of these mutations and the extent to which shared ancestry contributes to disease prevalence. The results demonstrate both shared European and American origins of RDEB mutations in distinct populations in the Americas and suggest the influence of Sephardic ancestry in at least some RDEB mutations of European origins. Knowledge of ancestry and relatedness among RDEB patient populations will be crucial for the development of future clinical trials and the advancement of novel therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "The Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) are key intracellular mediators in the signal transduction of many cytokines and growth factors. Common \u03b3 chain cytokines and interferon-\u03b3 that use the JAK/STAT pathway to induce biological responses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of alopecia areata (AA), a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the hair follicle. We previously showed that therapeutic targeting of JAK/STAT pathways using the first-generation JAK1/2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib, and the pan-JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib, was highly effective in the treatment of human AA, as well as prevention and reversal of AA in the C3H/HeJ mouse model. To better define the role of individual JAKs in the pathogenesis of AA, in this study, we tested and compared the efficacy of several next-generation JAK-selective inhibitors in the C3H/HeJ mouse model of AA, using both systemic and topical delivery. We found that JAK1-selective inhibitors as well as JAK3-selective inhibitors robustly induced hair regrowth and decreased AA-associated inflammation, whereas several JAK2-selective inhibitors failed to restore hair growth in treated C3H/HeJ mice with AA. Unlike JAK1, which is broadly expressed in many tissues, JAK3 expression is largely restricted to hematopoietic cells. Our study demonstrates inhibiting JAK3 signaling is sufficient to prevent and reverse disease in the preclinical model of AA.",

We detected overexpression of IL-7 in lesional skin from both humans and C3H/HeJ mice with alopecia areata (AA), a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the hair follicle. We found that exogenous IL-7 accelerated the onset of AA by augmenting the expansion of alopecic T cells. Conversely, blockade of IL-7 stopped the progression of AA and reversed early AA in C3H/HeJ mice.

        "Abstract": "The use of specific anti-tumor antibodies has transformed the solid cancer therapeutics landscape with the relative successes of therapies such as anti-HER2 in breast cancer, and anti-EGFR in HNSCC and colorectal cancer. However, these therapies result in toxicity and the emergence of resistant tumors. Here, we showed that removing immune suppression and enhancing stimulatory signals increased the anti-tumor activity of unmodified TA99 antibodies (anti-TYRP1) with a significant reduction of growth of solid tumors and lung metastases in mouse models of melanoma. Immune checkpoint blockade enhanced the efficacy of TA99, which was associated with greater CD8",

        "Abstract": "Predicting regulatory effects of genetic variants is a challenging but important problem in functional genomics. Given the relatively low sensitivity of functional assays, and the pervasiveness of class imbalance in functional genomic data, popular statistical prediction models can sharply underestimate the probability of a regulatory effect. We describe here the presence-only model (PO-EN), a type of semi-supervised model, to predict regulatory effects of genetic variants at sequence-level resolution in a context of interest by integrating a large number of epigenetic features and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs).",

        "Abstract": "Animal development and homeostasis depend on precise temporal and spatial intercellular signaling. Components shared between signaling pathways, generally thought to decrease specificity, paradoxically can also provide a solution to pathway coordination. Here we show that the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) and Wnt signaling pathways share Apcdd1 as a common inhibitor and that Apcdd1 is a taxon-restricted gene with novel domains and signaling functions. Previously, we showed that Apcdd1 inhibits Wnt signaling (Shimomura et\u00a0al., 2010), here we find that Apcdd1 potently inhibits BMP signaling in body axis formation and neural differentiation in chicken, frog, zebrafish. Furthermore, we find that Apcdd1 has an evolutionarily novel protein domain. Our results from experiments and modeling suggest that Apcdd1 may coordinate the outputs of two signaling pathways that are central to animal development and human disease.",

        "Abstract": "Drug screening studies for inflammatory skin diseases are currently performed using model systems that only partially recapitulate human diseased skin. Here, we developed a new strategy to incorporate T cells into human 3D skin constructs (HSCs), which enabled us to closely monitor and quantitate T cell responses. We found that the epidermis promotes the activation and infiltration of T cells into the skin, and provides a directional cue for their selective migration towards the epidermis. We established a psoriatic HSC (pHSC) by incorporating polarized Th1/Th17 cells or CCR6+CLA+\u2009T cells derived from psoriasis patients into the constructs. These pHSCs showed a psoriatic epidermal phenotype and characteristic cytokine profiles, and responded to various classes of psoriasis drugs, highlighting the potential utility of our model as a drug screening platform. Taken together, we developed an advanced immunocompetent 3D skin model to investigate epidermal-T cell interactions and to understand the pathophysiology of inflammatory skin diseases in a human-relevant and patient-specific context.",

        "Abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is a highly prevalent autoimmune disease that attacks the hair follicle and leads to hair loss that can range from small patches to complete loss of scalp and body hair. Our previous linkage and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) generated strong evidence for aetiological contributions from inherited genetic variants at different population frequencies, including both rare mutations and common polymorphisms. Additionally, we conducted gene expression (GE) studies on scalp biopsies of 96 patients and controls\u00a0to establish signatures of active disease. In this study, we performed an integrative analysis on these two datasets to test the hypothesis that rare CNVs in patients with AA could be leveraged to identify drivers of disease in our AA GE signatures. We analysed copy number variants (CNVs) in a case-control cohort of 673\u00a0patients with AA and 16 311\u00a0controls independent of the case-control cohort of 96 research participants used in our GE study. Using an integrative computational analysis, we identified 14 genes whose expression levels were altered by CNVs in a consistent direction of effect, corresponding to gene expression changes in lesional skin of patients. Four of these genes were affected by CNVs in three or more unrelated patients with AA, including ATG4B and SMARCA2, which are involved in autophagy and chromatin remodelling, respectively. Our findings identified new classes of genes with potential contributions to AA pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "The hair follicle (HF) is a complex mini-organ that constantly undergoes dynamic cycles of growth and regression throughout life. While proper progression of the hair cycle requires homeostatic interplay between the HF and its immune microenvironment, specific parts of the HF, such as the bulge throughout the hair cycle and the bulb in the anagen phase, maintain relative immune privilege (IP). When this IP collapses, inflammatory infiltrates that aggregate around the bulge and bulb launch an immune attack on the HF, resulting in hair loss or alopecia. Alopecia areata (AA) and primary cicatricial alopecia (PCA) are two common forms of immune-mediated alopecias, and recent advancements in understanding their disease mechanisms have accelerated the discovery of novel treatments for immune-mediated alopecias, specifically AA. In this review, we highlight the pathomechanisms involved in both AA and CA in hopes that a deeper understanding of their underlying disease pathogenesis will encourage the development of more effective treatments that can target distinct disease pathways with greater specificity while minimizing adverse effects.",

        "Abstract": "Hair growth can be induced from resting mouse hair follicles by topical application of JAK inhibitors, suggesting that JAK-STAT signaling is required for maintaining hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) in a quiescent state. Here, we show that Oncostatin M (OSM), an IL-6 family cytokine, negatively regulates hair growth by signaling through JAK-STAT5 to maintain HFSC quiescence. Genetic deletion of the OSM receptor or STAT5 can induce premature HFSC activation, suggesting that the resting telogen stage is actively maintained by the hair follicle niche. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the OSM source is not intrinsic to the hair follicle itself and is instead a subset of TREM2",

        "Abstract": "Human skin constructs (HSCs) have the potential to provide an effective therapy for patients with significant skin injuries and to enable human-relevant drug screening for skin diseases; however, the incorporation of engineered skin appendages, such as hair follicles (HFs), into HSCs remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate a biomimetic approach for generation of human HFs within HSCs by recapitulating the physiological 3D organization of cells in the HF microenvironment using 3D-printed molds. Overexpression of Lef-1 in dermal papilla cells (DPC) restores the intact DPC transcriptional signature and significantly enhances the efficiency of HF differentiation in HSCs. Furthermore, vascularization of hair-bearing HSCs prior to engraftment allows for efficient human hair growth in immunodeficient mice. The ability to regenerate an entire HF from cultured human cells will have a transformative impact on the medical management of different types of alopecia, as well as chronic wounds, which represent major unmet medical needs.",

        "Abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease in which cytotoxic T cells specifically target growing hair follicles. We used high-throughput TCR sequencing in the C3H/HeJ mouse model of AA and in human AA patients to gain insight into pathogenic T cell populations and their dynamics, which revealed clonal CD8+ T cell expansions in lesional skin. In the C3H/HeJ model, we observed interindividual sharing of TCR\u03b2 chain protein sequences, which strongly supports a model of antigenic drive in AA. The overlap between the lesional TCR repertoire and a population of CD8+NKG2D+ T cells in skin-draining lymph nodes identified this subset as pathogenic effectors. In AA patients, treatment with the oral JAK inhibitor tofacitinib resulted in a decrease in clonally expanded CD8+ T cells in the scalp but also revealed that many expanded lesional T cell clones do not completely disappear from either skin or blood during treatment with tofacitinib, which may explain in part the relapse of disease after stopping treatment.",

The Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, tofacitinib, has been shown to be effective in treating the noncicatricial alopecia, alopecia areata. As in alopecia areata, upregulation of interferon and JAK signaling may play a role in LPP. We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 10 patients with recalcitrant LPP who were treated with oral tofacitinib. Patients received oral tofacitinib 5 mg twice or three times daily for 2-19\u2009months as either monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to other ongoing treatments including intralesional triamcinolone, hydroxychloroquine, and tacrolimus ointment. Eight patients had clinical improvement in LPP with tofacitinib as either monotherapy (4/10) or adjunctive therapy (4/10). LPP Activity Index (LPPAI) before and after treatment was measured in seven patients and was significantly different (6.22 before treatment, 3.08 after treatment; p value\u2009=\u2009.0014). Reduction in LPPAI ranged from 30 to 94%. One patient complained of 10 pound (4.5 kg) weight gain after 12\u2009months on tofacitinib. No other adverse effects were reported. Treatment with oral tofacitinib either as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy can lead to measurable improvement in recalcitrant LPP.",

        "Abstract": "In the hair follicle, the dermal papilla (DP) and dermal sheath (DS) support and maintain proliferation and differentiation of the epithelial stem cells that produce the hair fibre. In view of their regulatory properties, in this study, we investigated the interaction between hair follicle dermal cells (DP and DS) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs); induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs); and haematopoietic stem cells. We found that coculture of follicular dermal cells with ESCs or iPSCs supported their prolonged maintenance in an apparently undifferentiated state as established by differentiation assays, immunocytochemistry, and RT-PCR for markers of undifferentiated ESCs. We further showed that cytokines that are involved in ESC support are also expressed by cultured follicle dermal cells, providing a possible explanation for maintenance of ES cell stemness in cocultures. The same cytokines were expressed within follicles ",

        "Abstract": "Immunotherapies are some of the most promising emergent treatments for several cancers, yet there remains a majority of patients who do not benefit from them due to immune-resistant tumors. One avenue for enhancing treatment for these patients is by converting these tumors to an immunoreactive state, thereby restoring treatment efficacy. By leveraging regulatory networks we previously characterized in autoimmunity, here we show that overexpression of the master regulator IKZF1 leads to enhanced immune infiltrate recruitment and tumor sensitivity to PD1 and CTLA4 inhibitors in several tumors that normally lack IKZF1 expression. This work provides proof of concept that tumors can be rendered susceptible by hijacking immune cell recruitment signals through molecular master regulators. On a broader scale, this work also demonstrates the feasibility of using computational approaches to drive the discovery of novel molecular mechanisms toward treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Levels of the N-terminally truncated isoform of p63 (\u0394N p63), well documented to play a pivotal role in basal epidermal gene expression and epithelial maintenance, need to be strictly regulated. We demonstrate here that the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) complex plays an essential role in the ubiquitin-mediated turnover of \u0394Np63\u03b1 through the M-G1 phase. In addition, syntaxin-binding protein 4 (Stxbp4), which we previously discovered to bind to \u0394Np63, can suppress the APC/C-mediated proteolysis of \u0394Np63. Supporting the physiological relevance, of these interactions, both Stxbp4 and an APC/C-resistant version of \u0394Np63\u03b1 (RL7-\u0394Np63\u03b1) inhibit the terminal differentiation process in 3D organotypic cultures. In line with this, both the stable RL7-\u0394Np63\u03b1 variant and Stxbp4 have oncogenic activity in soft agar and xenograft tumor assays. Notably as well, higher levels of Stxbp4 expression are correlated with the accumulation of \u0394Np63 in human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Our study reveals that Stxbp4 drives the oncogenic potential of \u0394Np63\u03b1 and may provide a relevant therapeutic target for SCC.",

        "Abstract": "We describe a method based on a latent Dirichlet\u00a0allocation model for predicting functional effects of noncoding genetic variants in a cell-type- and/or tissue-specific way (FUN-LDA). Using this unsupervised approach, we predict tissue-specific functional effects for every position in the human genome in 127 different tissues and cell types. We demonstrate the usefulness of our predictions by using several validation experiments. Using eQTL data from several sources, including the GTEx project, Geuvadis project, and TwinsUK cohort, we show that eQTLs in specific tissues tend to be most enriched among the predicted functional variants in relevant tissues in Roadmap. We further show how these integrated functional scores can be used for (1) deriving the most likely cell or tissue type causally implicated for a complex trait by using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies and (2) estimating a tissue-based correlation matrix of various complex traits. We found large enrichment of heritability in functional components of relevant tissues for various complex traits, and FUN-LDA yielded higher enrichment estimates than existing methods. Finally, using experimentally validated functional variants from the literature and variants possibly implicated in disease by previous studies, we rigorously compare FUN-LDA with state-of-the-art functional annotation methods and show that FUN-LDA has better prediction accuracy and higher resolution than these methods. In particular, our results suggest that tissue- and cell-type-specific functional prediction methods tend to have substantially better prediction accuracy than organism-level prediction methods. Scores for each position in the human genome and for each ENCODE and Roadmap tissue are available online (see Web Resources).",

        "Abstract": "Primary cicatricial alopecias (PCAs) are a group of skin diseases in which there is progressive and permanent destruction of hair follicles followed by replacement with fibrous tissue. Unfortunately, by the time patients seek clinical evaluation of their hair loss, the skin is already inflamed and/or scarred, so there is little hope for a return to their normal hair growth pattern. Clinical and basic science investigations are now focusing on three forms of human PCA: lichen planopilaris (LPP), frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) and central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA).

        "Abstract": "Many therapies are available for the treatment of alopecia areata, including topical, systemic, and injectable modalities. However, these treatment methods produce variable clinical outcomes and there are no currently available treatments that induce and sustain remission. When making management decisions, clinicians must first stratify patients into pediatric versus adult populations. Disease severity should then be determined (limited vs extensive) before deciding the final course of therapy. The second article in this continuing medical education series describes the evidence supporting new treatment methods, among them Janus kinase inhibitors. We evaluate the evidence concerning the efficacy, side effects, and durability of these medications. An overview of conventional therapy is also provided with new insights gleaned from recent studies. Finally, future promising therapeutic options that have not yet been fully evaluated will also be presented.",

Significant variations in the clinical presentation of AA have been observed, ranging from small, well-circumscribed patches of hair loss to a complete absence of body and scalp hair. Patients affected by AA encompass all age groups, sexes, and ethnicities, and may experience frustration with the unpredictable nature of their disease for which there is currently no definitive treatment. The cause of AA remains incompletely understood, though it is believed to result-at least in part-from a loss of immune privilege in the hair follicle, autoimmune-mediated hair follicle destruction, and the upregulation of inflammatory pathways. Patients with AA frequently experience marked impairment in psychological well-being, self-esteem, and may be more likely to suffer from psychiatric comorbidities. Part one of this two-part continuing medical education series describes the epidemiology, clinical evaluation, prognosis, and recent advancements in the understanding of the pathogenesis of AA.",

        "Abstract": "Treatments for alopecia areata (AA) have evolved over the decades from broad and nonspecific therapies to those that are now more targeted and rationally selected. This was achieved by means of close cooperation and communication between clinicians and basic scientists, which resulted in the elucidation and understanding of the unique pathophysiology of AA. In this review we discuss this evolution and how novel therapies for AA have changed over the decades, what we have in our current arsenal of drugs for this potentially devastating disease, and what the future holds.",

        "Abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is one of the most common forms of human hair loss. Although genetic studies have implicated autoimmune processes in AA etiology, understanding of the etiopathogenesis is incomplete. Recent research has implicated microRNAs, a class of small noncoding RNAs, in diverse autoimmune diseases. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the role of microRNAs in AA. In this study, gene-based analyses were performed for microRNAs using data of the largest genome-wide association meta-analysis of AA to date. Nominally, significant P-values were obtained for 78 of the 617 investigated microRNAs. After correction for multiple testing, three of the 78 microRNAs remained significant. Of these, miR-30b/d was the most significant microRNA for the follow-up analyses, which also showed lower expression in the hair follicle of AA patients. Target gene analyses for the three microRNAs showed 42 significantly associated target genes. These included IL2RA, TNXB, and ERBB3, which had been identified as susceptibility loci in previous genome-wide association studies. Using luciferase assay, site-specific miR-30b regulation of the AA risk genes IL2RA, STX17, and TNXB was validated. This study implicates microRNAs in the pathogenesis of AA. This finding may facilitate the development of future treatment strategies.",

        "Title": "Next generation human skin constructs as advanced tools for drug development.",
        "Abstract": "Many diseases, as well as side effects of drugs, manifest themselves through skin symptoms. Skin is a complex tissue that hosts various specialized cell types and performs many roles including physical barrier, immune and sensory functions. Therefore, modeling skin in\u00a0vitro presents technical challenges for tissue engineering. Since the first attempts at engineering human epidermis in 1970s, there has been a growing interest in generating full-thickness skin constructs mimicking physiological functions by incorporating various skin components, such as vasculature and melanocytes for pigmentation. Development of biomimetic in\u00a0vitro human skin models with these physiological functions provides a new tool for drug discovery, disease modeling, regenerative medicine and basic research for skin biology. This goal, however, has long been delayed by the limited availability of different cell types, the challenges in establishing co-culture conditions, and the ability to recapitulate the 3D anatomy of the skin. Recent breakthroughs in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and microfabrication techniques such as 3D-printing have allowed for building more reliable and complex in\u00a0vitro skin models for pharmaceutical screening. In this review, we focus on the current developments and prevailing challenges in generating skin constructs with vasculature, skin appendages such as hair follicles, pigmentation, immune response, innervation, and hypodermis. Furthermore, we discuss the promising advances that iPSC technology offers in order to generate in\u00a0vitro models of genetic skin diseases, such as epidermolysis bullosa and psoriasis. We also discuss how future integration of the next generation human skin constructs onto microfluidic platforms along with other tissues could revolutionize the early stages of drug development by creating reliable evaluation of patient-specific effects of pharmaceutical agents. Impact statement Skin is a complex tissue that hosts various specialized cell types and performs many roles including barrier, immune, and sensory functions. For human-relevant drug testing, there has been a growing interest in building more physiological skin constructs by incorporating different skin components, such as vasculature, appendages, pigment, innervation, and adipose tissue. This paper provides an overview of the strategies to build complex human skin constructs that can faithfully recapitulate human skin and thus can be used in drug development targeting skin diseases. In particular, we discuss recent developments and remaining challenges in incorporating various skin components, availability of iPSC-derived skin cell types and in\u00a0vitro skin disease models. In addition, we provide insights on the future integration of these complex skin models with other organs on microfluidic platforms as well as potential readout technologies for high-throughput drug screening.",

        "Title": "Alopecia areata.",
        "Abstract": "Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder characterized by transient, non-scarring hair loss and preservation of the hair follicle. Hair loss can take many forms ranging from loss in well-defined patches to diffuse or total hair loss, which can affect all hair-bearing sites. Patchy alopecia areata affecting the scalp is the most common type. Alopecia areata affects nearly 2% of the general population at some point during their lifetime. Skin biopsies of affected skin show a lymphocytic infiltrate in and around the bulb or the lower part of the hair follicle in the anagen (hair growth) phase. A breakdown of immune privilege of the hair follicle is thought to be an important driver of alopecia areata. Genetic studies in patients and mouse models have shown that alopecia areata is a complex, polygenic disease. Several genetic susceptibility loci were identified to be associated with signalling pathways that are important to hair follicle cycling and development. Alopecia areata is usually diagnosed based on clinical manifestations, but dermoscopy and histopathology can be helpful. Alopecia areata is difficult to manage medically, but recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms have revealed new treatments and the possibility of remission in the near future.",

Interestingly, others have shown that JAK-inhibition is able to induce telogen-to-anagen transition in wild-type mice. This apparent contradiction highlights the complexity of interactions within the hair follicle, and encourages further discussion on the role of JAK-STAT signaling in the various stem cell niches of the hair follicle.",

        "Abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease of the hair follicle that results in hair loss of varying severity. Recently, we showed that IFN-\u03b3-producing NKG2D(+)CD8(+) T cells actively infiltrate the hair follicle and are responsible for its destruction in C3H/HeJ AA mice. Our transcriptional profiling of human and mouse alopecic skin showed that the IFN pathway is the dominant signaling pathway involved in AA. We showed that IFN-inducible chemokines (CXCL9/10/11) are markedly upregulated in the skin of AA lesions, and further, that the IFN-inducible chemokine receptor, CXCR3, is upregulated on alopecic effector T cells. To demonstrate whether CXCL9/10/11 chemokines were required for development of AA, we treated mice with blocking Abs to CXCR3, which prevented the development of AA in the graft model, inhibiting the accumulation of NKG2D(+)CD8(+) T cells in the skin and cutaneous lymph nodes. These data demonstrate proof of concept that interfering with the Tc1 response in AA via blockade of IFN-inducible chemokines can prevent the onset of AA. CXCR3 blockade could be approached clinically in human AA with either biologic or small-molecule inhibition, the latter being particularly intriguing as a topical therapeutic.",

        "Abstract": "Vascularization of engineered human skin constructs is crucial for recapitulation of systemic drug delivery and for their long-term survival, functionality, and viable engraftment. In this study, the latest microfabrication techniques are used and a novel bioengineering approach is established to micropattern spatially controlled and perfusable vascular networks in 3D human skin equivalents using both primary and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived endothelial cells. Using 3D printing technology makes it possible to control the geometry of the micropatterned vascular networks. It is verified that vascularized human skin equivalents (vHSEs) can form a robust epidermis and establish an endothelial barrier function, which allows for the recapitulation of both topical and systemic delivery of drugs. In addition, the therapeutic potential of vHSEs for cutaneous wounds on immunodeficient mice is examined and it is demonstrated that vHSEs can both promote and guide neovascularization during wound healing. Overall, this innovative bioengineering approach can enable in vitro evaluation of topical and systemic drug delivery as well as improve the potential of engineered skin constructs to be used as a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of cutaneous wounds.",

        "Title": "Genomewide analysis of copy number variants in alopecia areata in a Central European cohort reveals association with MCHR2.",
        "Abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is a common hair loss disorder of autoimmune aetiology, which often results in pronounced psychological distress. Understanding of the pathophysiology of AA is increasing, due in part to recent genetic findings implicating common variants at several genetic loci. To date, no study has investigated the contribution of copy number variants (CNVs) to AA, a prominent class of genomic variants involved in other autoimmune disorders. Here, we report a genomewide- and a candidate gene-focused CNV analysis performed in a cohort of 585 patients with AA and 1340 controls of Central European origin. A nominally significant association with AA was found for CNVs in the following five chromosomal regions: 4q35.2, 6q16.3, 9p23, 16p12.1 and 20p12.1. The most promising finding was a 342.5-kb associated region in 6q16.3 (duplications in 4/585 patients; 0/1340 controls). The duplications spanned the genes MCHR2 and MCHR2-AS1, implicated in melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) signalling. These genes have not been implicated in previous studies of AA pathogenesis. However, previous research has shown that MCHR2 affects the scale colour of barfin flounder fish via the induction of melanin aggregation. AA preferentially affects pigmented hairs, and the hair of patients with AA frequently shows a change in colour when it regrows following an acute episode of AA. This might indicate a relationship between AA, pigmentation and MCH signalling. In conclusion, the present results provide suggestive evidence for the involvement of duplications in MCHR2 in AA pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Haplotype-dependent allele-specific methylation (hap-ASM) can impact disease susceptibility, but maps of this phenomenon using stringent criteria in disease-relevant tissues remain sparse. Here we apply array-based and Methyl-Seq approaches to multiple human tissues and cell types, including brain, purified neurons and glia, T lymphocytes, and placenta, and identify 795 hap-ASM differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 3,082 strong methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs), most not previously reported. More than half of these DMRs have cell type-restricted ASM, and among them are 188 hap-ASM DMRs and 933 mQTLs located near GWAS signals for immune and neurological disorders. Targeted bis-seq confirmed hap-ASM in 12/13 loci tested, including CCDC155, CD69, FRMD1, IRF1, KBTBD11, and S100A(\u2217)-ILF2, associated with immune phenotypes, MYT1L, PTPRN2, CMTM8 and CELF2, associated with neurological disorders, NGFR and HLA-DRB6, associated with both immunological and brain disorders, and ZFP57, a trans-acting regulator of genomic imprinting. Polymorphic CTCF and transcription factor (TF) binding sites were over-represented among hap-ASM DMRs and mQTLs, and analysis of the human data, supplemented by cross-species comparisons to macaques, indicated that CTCF and TF binding likelihood predicts the strength and direction of the allelic methylation asymmetry. These results show that hap-ASM is highly tissue specific; an important trans-acting regulator of genomic imprinting is regulated by this phenomenon; and variation in CTCF and TF binding sites is an underlying mechanism, and maps of hap-ASM and mQTLs reveal regulatory sequences underlying supra- and sub-threshold GWAS peaks in immunological and neurological disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Genome editing with engineered site-specific endonucleases involves nonhomologous end-joining, leading to reading frame disruption. The approach is applicable to dominant negative disorders, which can be treated simply by knocking out the mutant allele, while leaving the normal allele intact. We applied this strategy to dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DDEB), which is caused by a dominant negative mutation in the COL7A1 gene encoding type VII collagen (COL7). We performed genome editing with TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 targeting the mutation, c.8068_8084delinsGA. We then cotransfected Cas9 and guide RNA expression vectors expressed with GFP and DsRed, respectively, into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from DDEB fibroblasts. After sorting, 90% of the iPSCs were edited, and we selected four gene-edited iPSC lines for further study. These iPSCs were differentiated into keratinocytes and fibroblasts secreting COL7. RT-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed gene-edited COL7 with frameshift mutations degraded at the protein level. In addition, we confirmed that the gene-edited truncated COL7 could neither associate with normal COL7 nor undergo triple helix formation. Our data establish the feasibility of mutation site-specific genome editing in dominant negative disorders.",

The DEBRA 2015 Research Conference, held in May 2015, brought together investigators and clinicians from around the world working at the forefront of EB research. Discussing the state-of-the-art approaches from a wide range of disciplines, there was a palpable excitement at this conference brought about by the optimism about applying new sequencing techniques, genome editing, protein replacement, autologous and allogeneic stem cell therapy, innovations in cancer biology, revertant mosaicism, and induced pluripotent stem cell techniques, all of which are aimed at developing new therapies for EB. Many in the field who have participated in EB research for many years were especially enthusiastic and felt that, possibly for the first time, the field seems uniquely poised to bring these new tools to effectively tackle EB. Multiple complementary approaches are currently in motion toward improved quality of life and eventually a cure for patients suffering from EB, a currently intractable disease.",

Here, using Alopecia Areata (AA) as a model, we have adapted regulatory network analysis to specifically isolate physiological behaviors in the skin that contribute to the recruitment of immune cells in autoimmune disease. We use context-specific regulatory networks to deconvolve and identify skin-specific regulatory modules with IKZF1 and DLX4 as master regulators (MRs). These MRs are sufficient to induce AA-like molecular states ",

        "Abstract": "Several forms of hair loss in humans are characterized by the inability of hair follicles to enter the growth phase (anagen) of the hair cycle after being arrested in the resting phase (telogen). Current pharmacologic therapies have been largely unsuccessful in targeting pathways that can be selectively modulated to induce entry into anagen. We show that topical treatment of mouse and human skin with small-molecule inhibitors of the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway results in rapid onset of anagen and subsequent hair growth. We show that JAK inhibition regulates the activation of key hair follicle populations such as the hair germ and improves the inductivity of cultured human dermal papilla cells by controlling a molecular signature enriched in intact, fully inductive dermal papillae. Our findings open new avenues for exploration of JAK-STAT inhibition for promotion of hair growth and highlight the role of this pathway in regulating the activation of hair follicle stem cells.",

        "Abstract": "The current utility of 3D skin equivalents is limited by the fact that existing models fail to recapitulate the cellular complexity of human skin. They often contain few cell types and no appendages, in part because many cells found in the skin are difficult to isolate from intact tissue and cannot be expanded in culture. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) present an avenue by which we can overcome this issue due to their ability to be differentiated into multiple cell types in the body and their unlimited growth potential. We previously reported generation of the first human 3D skin equivalents from iPSC-derived fibroblasts and iPSC-derived keratinocytes, demonstrating that iPSCs can provide a foundation for modeling a complex human organ such as skin. Here, we have increased the complexity of this model by including additional iPSC-derived melanocytes. Epidermal melanocytes, which are largely responsible for skin pigmentation, represent the second most numerous cell type found in normal human epidermis and as such represent a logical next addition. We report efficient melanin production from iPSC-derived melanocytes and transfer within an entirely iPSC-derived epidermal-melanin unit and generation of the first functional human 3D skin equivalents made from iPSC-derived fibroblasts, keratinocytes and melanocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Reduced expression of both classical and desmosomal cadherins has been associated with different types of carcinomas, including prostate cancer. This study aims to provide a comprehensive view of the role and regulation of cell-cell adhesion in prostate cancer aggressiveness by examining the functional implications of both E-cadherin and Desmoglein 2 (DSG2). E-cadherin expression was first examined using immunofluorescence in 50 normal prostate tissues and in a cohort of 414 prostate cancer patients. Correlation and survival analyses were performed to assess its clinical significance. In primary prostate cancer patients, reduced expression of both E-cadherin and DSG2 is significantly associated with an earlier biochemical recurrence. Transgenic DU145 E-cadherin knockdown and constitutively active AKT overexpression lines were generated. Functional implications of such genetic alterations were analyzed in vitro and in vivo, the latter by using tumorigenesis as well as extravasation and metastatic tumor formation assays. We observed that loss of E-cadherin leads to impaired primary and metastatic tumor formation in vivo, suggesting a tumor promoter role for E-cadherin in addition to its known role as a tumor suppressor. Activation of AKT leads to a significant reduction in E-cadherin expression and nuclear localization of Snail, suggesting a role for the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the transient repression of E-cadherin. This reduced expression may be regulated by separate mechanisms as neither the loss of E-cadherin nor activation of AKT significantly affected DSG2 expression. In conclusion, these findings illustrate the critical role of cell-cell adhesion in the progression to aggressive prostate cancer, through regulation by the PI3K pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a severe skin blistering disease caused by mutations in COL7A1-encoding type VII collagen (C7). Currently, there is no curative therapy for patients with RDEB. Our previous studies demonstrated that human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) derived unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs) express C7 and facilitate wound healing in a murine wounding model. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the therapeutic functions of USSCs in the C7 null (Col7a1(-/-) ) C57BL6/J mice, a murine model of RDEB. We demonstrated that intrahepatic administration of USSCs significantly improved the blistering phenotype and enhanced the life span in the recipients. The injected USSCs trafficked to the sites of blistering and were incorporated in short-term in the recipients' skin and gastrointestinal tract. Consistent with an overall histological improvement in the epidermal-dermal adherence following USSC treatment, the expression of C7 at the basement membrane zone was detected and the previously disorganized integrin \u03b16 distribution was normalized. We also demonstrated that USSCs treatment induced an infiltration of macrophages with a regenerative \"M2\" phenotype. Our data suggest that HUCB-derived USSCs improved the RDEB phenotype through multiple mechanisms. This study has warranted future clinical investigation of USSCs as a novel and universal allogeneic stem cell donor source in selected patients with RDEB.",

        "Abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is a prevalent autoimmune disease with 10 known susceptibility loci. Here we perform the first meta-analysis of research on AA by combining data from two genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and replication with supplemented ImmunoChip data for a total of 3,253 cases and 7,543 controls. The strongest region of association is the major histocompatibility complex, where we fine-map four independent effects, all implicating human leukocyte antigen-DR as a key aetiologic driver. Outside the major histocompatibility complex, we identify two novel loci that exceed the threshold of statistical significance, containing ACOXL/BCL2L11(BIM) (2q13); GARP (LRRC32) (11q13.5), as well as a third nominally significant region SH2B3(LNK)/ATXN2 (12q24.12). Candidate susceptibility gene expression analysis in these regions demonstrates expression in relevant immune cells and the hair follicle. We integrate our results with data from seven other autoimmune diseases and provide insight into the alignment of AA within these disorders. Our findings uncover new molecular pathways disrupted in AA, including autophagy/apoptosis, transforming growth factor beta/Tregs and JAK kinase signalling, and support the causal role of aberrant immune processes in AA.",

The prototype is Carvajal syndrome, characterized by cardiomyopathy, woolly hair, palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK), and skin fragility. We report the case of a 3-year-old boy presenting with severe left-sided heart failure with a preceding history of cutaneous abnormalities including congenital alopecia, PPK, nail dystrophy, and follicular hyperkeratosis on the extensor surfaces. Genetic testing revealed a novel combination of two heterozygous mutations in the DSP gene encoding desmoplakin: R1400X and R2284X. Both are predicted to be deleterious to protein function. This case adds to our understanding of the spectrum of clinical presentations of syndromes associated with desmoplakin mutations and highlights the need for cardiac examination in patients with characteristic cutaneous findings.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in bio-mimetic in vitro human skin models increase the efficiency of drug screening studies. In this study, we designed and developed a microfluidic platform that allows for long-term maintenance of full thickness human skin equivalents (HSE) which are comprised of both the epidermal and dermal compartments. The design is based on the physiologically relevant blood residence times in human skin tissue and allows for the establishment of an air-epidermal interface which is crucial for maturation and terminal differentiation of HSEs. The small scale of the design reduces the amount of culture medium and the number of cells required by 36 fold compared to conventional transwell cultures. Our HSE-on-a-chip platform has the capability to recirculate the medium at desired flow rates without the need for pump or external tube connections. We demonstrate that the platform can be used to maintain HSEs for three weeks with proliferating keratinocytes similar to conventional HSE cultures. Immunohistochemistry analyses show that the differentiation and localization of keratinocytes was successfully achieved, establishing all sub-layers of the epidermis after one week. Basal keratinocytes located at the epidermal-dermal interface remain in a proliferative state for three weeks. We use a transdermal transport model to show that the skin barrier function is maintained for three weeks. We also validate the capability of the HSE-on-a-chip platform to be used for drug testing purposes by examining the toxic effects of doxorubucin on skin cells and structure. Overall, the HSE-on-a-chip is a user-friendly and cost-effective in vitro platform for drug testing of candidate molecules for skin disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Revertant mosaicism is a naturally occurring phenomenon involving spontaneous correction of a pathogenic gene mutation in a somatic cell. It has been observed in several genetic diseases, including epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a group of inherited skin disorders characterized by blistering and scarring. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), generated from fibroblasts or keratinocytes, have been proposed as a treatment for EB. However, this requires genome editing to correct the mutations, and, in gene therapy, efficiency of targeted gene correction and deleterious genomic modifications are still limitations of translation. We demonstrate the generation of iPSCs from revertant keratinocytes of a junctional EB patient with compound heterozygous COL17A1 mutations. These revertant iPSCs were then differentiated into naturally genetically corrected keratinocytes that expressed type XVII collagen (Col17). Gene expression profiling showed a strong correlation between gene expression in revertant iPSC-derived keratinocytes and the original revertant keratinocytes, indicating the successful differentiation of iPSCs into the keratinocyte lineage. Revertant-iPSC keratinocytes were then used to create in vitro three-dimensional skin equivalents and reconstitute human skin in vivo in mice, both of which expressed Col17 in the basal layer. Therefore, revertant keratinocytes may be a viable source of spontaneously gene-corrected cells for developing iPSC-based therapeutic approaches in EB.",

Importantly, a single mutation in one of these molecules can disrupt the entire organization and function of these essential networks, leading to cell separation, blistering, and other striking phenotypes observed in inherited skin diseases. Over the past several decades, the genetic basis of many monogenic skin diseases has been elucidated using classical genetic techniques. Importantly, the findings from these studies has shed light onto the many classes of molecules and essential genetic as well as molecular interactions that lend the skin its rigid, yet flexible properties. With the advent of the human genome project, next-generation sequencing techniques, as well as several other recently developed methods, tremendous progress has been made in dissecting the genetic architecture of complex, non-Mendelian skin diseases.",

        "Title": "Alopecia areata is driven by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and is reversed by JAK inhibition.",
        "Abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease resulting from damage of the hair follicle by T cells. The immune pathways required for autoreactive T cell activation in AA are not defined limiting clinical development of rational targeted therapies. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) implicated ligands for the NKG2D receptor (product of the KLRK1 gene) in disease pathogenesis. Here, we show that cytotoxic CD8(+)NKG2D(+) T cells are both necessary and sufficient for the induction of AA in mouse models of disease. Global transcriptional profiling of mouse and human AA skin revealed gene expression signatures indicative of cytotoxic T cell infiltration, an interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) response and upregulation of several \u03b3-chain (\u03b3c) cytokines known to promote the activation and survival of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8(+)NKG2D(+) effector T cells. Therapeutically, antibody-mediated blockade of IFN-\u03b3, interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interleukin-15 receptor \u03b2 (IL-15R\u03b2) prevented disease development, reducing the accumulation of CD8(+)NKG2D(+) T cells in the skin and the dermal IFN response in a mouse model of AA. Systemically administered pharmacological inhibitors of Janus kinase (JAK) family protein tyrosine kinases, downstream effectors of the IFN-\u03b3 and \u03b3c cytokine receptors, eliminated the IFN signature and prevented the development of AA, while topical administration promoted hair regrowth and reversed established disease. Notably, three patients treated with oral ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, achieved near-complete hair regrowth within 5 months of treatment, suggesting the potential clinical utility of JAK inhibition in human AA.",

        "Abstract": "Mechanisms that regulate the growth of eyelashes have remained obscure. We ascertained two families from Pakistan who presented with familial trichomegaly, or extreme eyelash growth. Using a combination of whole exome sequencing and homozygosity mapping, we identified distinct pathogenic mutations within fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) that underlie the disorder. Subsequent sequencing of this gene in several additional trichomegaly families identified an additional mutation in FGF5. We further demonstrated that hair fibers from forearms of these patients were significantly longer than hairs from control individuals, with an increased proportion in the growth phase, anagen. Using hair follicle organ cultures, we show that FGF5 induces regression of the human hair follicle. We have identified FGF5 as a crucial regulator of hair growth in humans for the first time, to our knowledge, and uncovered a therapeutic target to selectively regulate eyelash growth.",

        "Abstract": "The tremendous cost of drug development is often attributed to the long time interval between identifying lead compounds in preclinical studies to assessing clinical efficacy in randomized clinical trials. Many candidate molecules show promise in cell culture or animal models, only to fail in late stage in human investigations. There is a need for novel technologies that allow investigators to quickly and reliably predict drug safety and efficacy. The advent of microtechnology has made it possible to integrate multiple microphysiologic organ systems into a single microfabricated chip. This review focuses on three-dimensional engineered skin, which has enjoyed a long history of uses both in clinical treatments of refractory ulcers and as a laboratory model. We discuss current biological and engineering challenges in construction of a robust bioengineered skin and provide a blueprint for its potential utility to model dermatologic disorders such as psoriasis or cutaneous drug reactions.",

        "Abstract": "Inherited hypertrichoses are rare syndromes characterized by excessive hair growth that does not result from androgen stimulation, and are often associated with additional congenital abnormalities. In this study, we investigated the genetic defect in a case of autosomal recessive congenital generalized hypertrichosis terminalis (CGHT) (OMIM135400) using whole-exome sequencing. We identified a single base pair substitution in the 5' donor splice site of intron 32 in the ABC lipid transporter gene ABCA5 that leads to aberrant splicing of the transcript and a decrease in protein levels throughout patient hair follicles. The homozygous recessive disruption of ABCA5 leads to reduced lysosome function, which results in an accumulation of autophagosomes, autophagosomal cargos as well as increased endolysosomal cholesterol in CGHT keratinocytes. In an unrelated sporadic case of CGHT, we identified a 1.3 Mb cryptic deletion of chr17q24.2-q24.3 encompassing ABCA5 and found that ABCA5 levels are dramatically reduced throughout patient hair follicles. Collectively, our findings support ABCA5 as a gene underlying the CGHT phenotype and suggest a novel, previously unrecognized role for this gene in regulating hair growth.",

        "Abstract": "Hairless mice carrying homozygous mutations in hairless gene manifest rudimentary hair follicles (HFs), epidermal cysts, hairless phenotype, and enhanced susceptibility to squamous cell carcinomas. However, their susceptibility to basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), a neoplasm considered originated from HF-localized stem cells, is unknown. To demonstrate the role of HFs in BCC development, we bred Ptch(+/-)/C57BL6 with SKH-1 hairless mice, followed by brother-sister cross to get F2 homozygous mutant (hairless) or wild-type (haired) mice. UVB-induced inflammation was less pronounced in shaved haired than in hairless mice. In hairless mice, inflammatory infiltrate was found around the rudimentary HFs and epidermal cysts. Expression of epidermal IL1f6, S100a8, vitamin D receptor, repetin, and major histocompatibility complex II, biomarkers depicting susceptibility to cutaneous inflammation, was also higher. In these animals, HF disruption altered susceptibility to UVB-induced BCCs. Tumor onset in hairless mice was 10 weeks earlier than in haired littermates. The incidence of BCCs was significantly higher in hairless than in haired animals; however, the magnitude of sonic hedgehog signaling did not differ significantly. Overall, 100% of hairless mice developed >12 tumors per mouse after 32 weeks of UVB therapy, whereas haired mice developed fewer than three tumors per mouse after 44 weeks of long-term UVB irradiation. Tumors in hairless mice were more aggressive than in haired littermates and manifested decreased E-cadherin and enhanced mesenchymal proteins. These data provide novel evidence that disruption of HFs in Ptch(+/-) mice enhances cutaneous susceptibility to inflammation and BCCs.",

        "Abstract": "The discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in 2006 was a major breakthrough for regenerative medicine. The establishment of patient-specific iPSCs has created the opportunity to model diseases in culture systems, with the potential to rapidly advance the drug discovery field. Current methods of drug discovery are inefficient, with a high proportion of drug candidates failing during clinical trials due to low efficacy and/or high toxicity. Many drugs fail toxicity testing during clinical trials, since the cells on which they have been tested do not adequately model three-dimensional tissues or their interaction with other organs in the body. There is a need to develop microphysiological systems that reliably represent both an intact tissue and also the interaction of a particular tissue with other systems throughout the body. As the port of entry for many drugs is via topical delivery, the skin is the first line of exposure, and also one of the first organs to demonstrate a reaction after systemic drug delivery. In this review, we discuss our strategy to develop a microphysiological system using iPSCs that recapitulates human skin for analyzing the interactions of drugs with the skin.",

Subsequently, several studies using cultured cells have enabled identification of hair growth modulators with similar properties to the currently available drugs, which may also provide clinical benefit. In situations where the current therapeutics do not work, follicular unit transplantation is an alternative surgical option. More recently, the concept of follicular cell implantation, or hair follicle neogenesis, has been attempted, exploiting the inherent properties of cultured hair follicle cells to induce de novo hair growth in balding scalp. In this review, we discuss both the advances in cell culture techniques that have led to a wider range of potential therapeutics to promote hair growth, in addition to detailing current knowledge on follicular cell implantation, and the challenges in making this approach a reality.",

        "Abstract": "The hairless (HR) protein contains a Jumonji C (JmjC) domain that is conserved among a family of proteins with histone demethylase (HDM) activity. To test whether HR possesses HDM activity, we performed a series of in vitro demethylation assays, which demonstrated that HR can demethylate monomethylated or dimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me1 or me2). Moreover, ectopic expression of wild-type HR, but not JmjC-mutant HR, led to pronounced demethylation of H3K9 in cultured human HeLa cells. We also show that two missense mutations in HR, which we and others described in patients with atrichia with papular lesions, abolished the demethylase activity of HR, demonstrating the role of HR demethylase activity in human disease. By ChIP-Seq analysis, we identified multiple new HR target genes, many of which play important roles in epidermal development, neural function, and transcriptional regulation, consistent with the predicted biological functions of HR. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that HR is a H3K9 demethylase that regulates epidermal homeostasis via direct control of its target genes.",

        "Abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is a nonscarring and recurrent disease characterized by hair loss that may significantly affect patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Given the lack of reliable and accurate reporting of HRQoL status in patients with AA, we analyzed data from 532 AA patients from the National Alopecia Areata Registry whose registry record included HRQoL assessments using three validated instruments: Skindex-16, brief version of the Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale, and Dermatology Life Quality Index. The mean HRQoL scores were compared with previously reported HRQoL levels from healthy controls and patients with other skin diseases. Two-step cluster analysis of Skindex-16 scales divided patients into two groups: 481 (57%) with good HRQoL and 361 (43%) with poor HRQoL. Multivariate logistic regression modeling revealed a set of risk factors for poor HRQoL: age <50 years (odds ratio (OR) 3.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.66-9.58), female gender (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.73-4.34), hair loss 25-99% (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.12-5.45), family stress (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.13-2.86), and job change (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.02-3.94). The current analysis provides an overview of the HRQoL status of AA patients and may guide patient care in the future.",

        "Abstract": "A major impetus to initiating the Human Genome Project was the belief that information encoded in the human genome would \"accelerate progress in understanding disease pathogenesis and in developing new approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention in many areas of medicine\". Alopecia areata (AA) is a notable example of how understanding the genetic basis of a disease can have an impact on the care of patients in a relatively short time. Our first genome-wide association study in AA identified an initial set of common variants that increase risk of AA, some of which are shared with other autoimmune diseases. Thus, there has already been rapid progress in the translation of this information into new therapeutic strategies for patients, as drugs are already on the market for some of these disorders that can now be tested in AA. Informed by the progress achieved with genetic studies for mechanistically aligned autoimmune diseases, we are poised to carry this work forward and interrogate the underlying disease mechanisms in AA. Importantly, future genetic studies aimed at identifying additional susceptibility genes will further establish the foundation for the application of precision medicine in the care of AA patients.",

        "Abstract": "Recent generation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (PS-iPSCs) provides significant advantages for cell- and gene-based therapy. Establishment of iPSC-based therapy for skin diseases requires efficient methodology for differentiating iPSCs into both keratinocytes and fibroblasts, the major cellular components of the skin, as well as the reconstruction of skin structures using these iPSC-derived skin components. We previously reported generation of keratinocytes from human iPSCs for use in the treatment of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene. Here, we developed a protocol for differentiating iPSCs into dermal fibroblasts, which also produce type VII collagen and therefore also have the potential to treat RDEB. Moreover, we generated in vitro 3D skin equivalents composed exclusively human iPSC-derived keratinocytes and fibroblasts for disease models and regenerative therapies for skin diseases, first demonstrating that iPSCs can provide the basis for modeling a human organ derived entirely from two different types of iPSC-derived cells.",

        "Abstract": "De novo organ regeneration has been observed in several lower organisms, as well as rodents; however, demonstrating these regenerative properties in human cells and tissues has been challenging. In the hair follicle, rodent hair follicle-derived dermal cells can interact with local epithelia and induce de novo hair follicles in a variety of hairless recipient skin sites. However, multiple attempts to recapitulate this process in humans using human dermal papilla cells in human skin have failed, suggesting that human dermal papilla cells lose key inductive properties upon culture. Here, we performed global gene expression analysis of human dermal papilla cells in culture and discovered very rapid and profound molecular signature changes linking their transition from a 3D to a 2D environment with early loss of their hair-inducing capacity. We demonstrate that the intact dermal papilla transcriptional signature can be partially restored by growth of papilla cells in 3D spheroid cultures. This signature change translates to a partial restoration of inductive capability, and we show that human dermal papilla cells, when grown as spheroids, are capable of inducing de novo hair follicles in human skin.",

        "Abstract": "Hairless (HR) is a nuclear protein with corepressor activity that is highly expressed in the skin and hair follicle. Mutations in Hairless lead to hair loss accompanied by the appearance of papules (atrichia with papular lesions), and similar phenotypes appear when the key polyamine enzymes ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and spermidine/spermine N(1) -acetyltransferase (SSAT) are overexpressed. Both ODC and SSAT transgenic mice have elevated epidermal levels of putrescine, leading us to investigate the mechanistic link between putrescine and HR. We show here that HR and putrescine form a negative regulatory network, as epidermal ODC expression is elevated when HR is decreased and vice versa. We also show that the regulation of ODC by HR is dependent on the MYC superfamily of proteins, in particular MYC, MXI1 and MXD3. Furthermore, we found that elevated levels of putrescine lead to decreased HR expression, but that the SSAT-TG phenotype is distinct from that found when HR is mutated.

        "Abstract": "X-linked congenital generalized hypertrichosis (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 307150) is an extremely rare condition of hair overgrowth on different body sites. We previously reported linkage in a large Mexican family with X-linked congenital generalized hypertrichosis cosegregating with deafness and with dental and palate anomalies to Xq24-27. Using SNP oligonucleotide microarray analysis and whole-genome sequencing, we identified a 389-kb interchromosomal insertion at an extragenic palindrome site at Xq27.1 that completely cosegregates with the disease. Among the genes surrounding the insertion, we found that Fibroblast Growth Factor 13 (FGF13) mRNA levels were significantly reduced in affected individuals, and immunofluorescence staining revealed a striking decrease in FGF13 localization throughout the outer root sheath of affected hair follicles. Taken together, our findings suggest a role for FGF13 in hair follicle growth and in the hair cycle.",

        "Abstract": "Human umbilical cord blood (CB)-derived unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs) have previously been demonstrated to have a broad differentiation potential and regenerative beneficial effects when administered in animal models of multiple degenerative diseases. Here we demonstrated that USSCs could be induced to express genes that hallmark keratinocyte differentiation. We also demonstrated that USSCs express type VII collagen (C7), a protein that is absent or defective in patients with an inherited skin disease, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). In mice with full-thickness excisional wounds, a single intradermal injection of USSCs at a 1-cm distance to the wound edge resulted in significantly accelerated wound healing. USSC-treated wounds displayed a higher density of CD31(+) cells, and the wounds healed with a significant increase in skin appendages. These beneficial effects were demonstrated without apparent differentiation of the injected USSCs into keratinocytes or endothelial cells. In vivo bioluminescent imaging (BLI) revealed specific migration of USSCs modified with a luciferase reporter gene, from a distant intradermal injection site to the wound, as well as following systemic injection of USSCs. These data suggest that CB-derived USSCs could significantly contribute to wound repair and be potentially used in cell therapy for patients with RDEB.",

        "Abstract": "Hereditary hypertrichoses are a group of hair overgrowth syndromes that are extremely rare in humans. We have previously demonstrated that a position effect on TRPS1 is associated with hypertrichosis in humans and mice. To gain insight into the functional role of Trps1, we analyzed the late morphogenesis vibrissae phenotype of Trps1(\u0394gt) mutant mice, which is characterized by follicle degeneration after peg downgrowth has been initiated. We found that Trps1 directly represses expression of the hair follicle stem cell regulator Sox9 to control proliferation of the follicle epithelium. Furthermore, we identified a copy number variation upstream of SOX9 in a family with hypertrichosis that significantly decreases expression of the gene in the hair follicle, providing new insights into the long-range regulation of SOX9. Our findings uncover a novel transcriptional hierarchy that regulates epithelial proliferation in the developing hair follicle and contributes to the pathology of hypertrichosis.",

        "Abstract": "The study of rare genetic disorders of the hair follicle has resulted in the identification of many causative genes, leading to the potential for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for both inherited and acquired hair disorders. In this issue, Fujimoto et al. identify a missense mutation within the keratin 71 (KRT71) gene as the cause for autosomal dominant woolly hair/hypotrichosis in a Japanese family. This represents the first human mutation in KRT71 to be linked to a hair disorder, establishing this gene as an important determinant of mammalian hair texture. Moreover, this finding provides new insight into the relationship between similar phenotypes resulting from mutations in distinct regulatory pathways and underscores the role of the inner root sheath in human hair growth.",

        "Title": "Loss of hairless confers susceptibility to UVB-induced tumorigenesis via disruption of NF-kappaB signaling.",
        "Abstract": "In order to model squamous cell carcinoma development in vivo, researchers have long preferred hairless mouse models such as SKH-1 mice that have traditionally been classified as 'wild-type' mice irrespective of the genetic factors underlying their hairless phenotype. The work presented here shows that mutations in the Hairless (Hr) gene not only result in the hairless phenotype of the SKH-1 and Hr(-/-) mouse lines but also cause aberrant activation of NF\u03baB and its downstream effectors. We show that in the epidermis, Hr is an early UVB response gene that regulates NF\u03baB activation and thereby controls cellular responses to irradiation. Therefore, when Hr expression is decreased in Hr mutant animals there is a corresponding increase in NF\u03baB activity that is augmented by UVB irradiation. This constitutive activation of NF\u03baB in the Hr mutant epidermis leads to the stimulation a large variety of downstream effectors including the cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and cyclin E, the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2, and the pro-inflammatory protein Cox-2. Therefore, Hr loss results in a state of uncontrolled epidermal proliferation that promotes tumor development, and Hr mutant mice should no longer be considered merely hairless 'wild-type' mice. Instead, Hr is a crucial UVB response gene and its loss creates a permissive environment that potentiates increased tumorigenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Hairless (HR) is a nuclear protein with corepressor activity whose exact function in the skin remains to be determined. Mutations in both human and mouse Hairless lead to hair loss accompanied by the appearance of papules, a disorder called atrichia with papular lesions. Furthermore, mice with mutations in HR are known to have a higher susceptibility to ultraviolet radiation-induced tumorigenesis, suggesting that HR plays a crucial role in the epidermal UVB response. Using normal human keratinocytes (NHKs) and keratinocytes containing a mutation in HR, we found that HR is an early UVB response gene that negatively regulates NF\u03baB mRNA expression. HR mutant keratinocytes have a dysregulated UVB response that includes increased proliferation and the aberrant activation of NF\u03baB effector genes. Additionally, we show that another UVB response gene, TNF\u03b1, negatively regulates HR mRNA expression. TNF\u03b1-induced negative regulation of HR occurs through a direct interaction of the p65 subunit with a single NF\u03baB-binding domain located in the HR promoter region. Therefore, we show for the first time that HR and NF\u03baB participate in a positive feedback loop that can be initiated either by UVB or TNF\u03b1.",

        "Abstract": "Generalized peeling skin syndrome (PSS) is an autosomal recessive genodermatosis characterized by lifelong, continuous shedding of the upper epidermis. Using whole-genome homozygozity mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we identified a novel homozygous missense mutation (c.229C>T, R77W) within the CHST8 gene, in a large consanguineous family with non-inflammatory PSS type A. CHST8 encodes a Golgi transmembrane N-acetylgalactosamine-4-O-sulfotransferase (GalNAc4-ST1), which we show by immunofluorescence staining to be expressed throughout normal epidermis. A colorimetric assay for total sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, comparing human keratinocytes (CCD1106 KERTr) expressing wild type and mutant recombinant GalNAc4-ST1, revealed decreased levels of total sulfated GAGs in cells expressing mutant GalNAc4-ST1, suggesting loss of function. Western blotting revealed lower expression levels of mutant recombinant GalNAc4-ST1 compared to wild type, suggesting that accelerated degradation may result in loss of function, leading to PSS type A. This is the first report describing a mutation as the cause of PSS type A.",

        "Abstract": "Tremendous progress has been made in the past two decades in molecular genetics of heritable skin diseases, and pathogenic mutations have been identified in as many as 500 distinct human genes. This progress has resulted in improved diagnosis with prognostic implications, has refined genetic counseling, and has formed the basis for prenatal and presymptomatic testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. However, there has been relatively little progress in developing effective and specific treatments for these often devastating diseases. However, very recently, a number of novel molecular strategies, including gene therapy, cell-based approaches, and protein replacement therapy, have been explored for the treatment of these conditions. This overview will focus on the prototypic heritable blistering disorders, epidermolysis bullosa, and related keratinopathies, in which significant progress has been made recently toward treatment, and it will illustrate how some of the translational research therapies have already entered the clinical arena.",

        "Abstract": "Mutations in TRPS1 cause trichorhinophalangeal syndrome types I and III, which are characterized by sparse scalp hair in addition to craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities. Trps1 is a vertebrate transcription factor that contains nine zinc-finger domains, including a GATA-type zinc finger through which it binds DNA. Mice in which the GATA domain of Trps1 has been deleted (Trps1(\u0394gt/\u0394gt)) have a reduced number of pelage follicles and lack vibrissae follicles postnatally. To identify the transcriptional targets of Trps1 in the developing vibrissa follicle, we performed microarray hybridization analysis, comparing expression patterns in the whisker pads of wild-type versus Trps1(\u0394gt/\u0394gt) embryos. We identified a number of transcription factors and Wnt inhibitors among transcripts downregulated in the mutant embryos and several extracellular matrix proteins that were upregulated in the mutant samples, and demonstrated that target gene expression levels were altered in vivo in Trps1(\u0394gt/\u0394gt) vibrissae. Unexpectedly, we discovered that Trps1 can directly bind the promoters of its target genes to activate transcription, expanding upon its established role as a transcriptional repressor. Our findings identify Trps1 as a novel regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway and of early hair follicle progenitors in the developing vibrissa follicle.",

        "Abstract": "Synpolydactyly 1 (SPD1; OMIM 186000), also known as type II syndactyly, is a dominantly inherited limb malformation that is characterized by an increased number of digits. SPD1 is most commonly caused by polyalanine repeat expansions in the coding region of the HOXD13 gene, which are believed to show a dominant-negative effect. In addition, missense and out-of-frame deletion mutations in the HOXD13 gene are also known to cause SPD, and the mechanism responsible for the phenotype appears to be haploinsufficiency. Here, we analyzed a large consanguineous family from Pakistan with SPD showing a wide variation in phenotype among affected individuals. We performed genetic linkage analysis, which identified a region on chromosome 2 containing the HOXD13 gene. Haplotype analysis with microsatellite markers suggested segregation of the phenotype with HOXD13 gene with incomplete penetrance. Direct sequencing analysis of HOXD13 gene revealed a nonsense mutation, designated as Q248X. All affected individuals with the severe SPD phenotype are homozygous for the mutation, whereas those with the mild SPD phenotype are heterozygous for the mutation. Furthermore, some unaffected individuals also carry the mutation in the heterozygous state, showing incomplete penetrance. Our results show the first nonsense mutation in the HOXD13 gene underlying a severe form of SPD in the homozygous state, and a milder form of SPD with \u223c50% penetrance in the heterozygous state, most likely because of the production of 50% of protein compared with normal individuals.",

        "Abstract": "In the United States, alopecia areata (AA) is the most prevalent autoimmune disease, affecting approximately 5.3 million people, including males and females of all ages and across all ethnic groups. AA affects more individuals than most other autoimmune diseases combined, and yet despite its prevalence, there is little information on the underlying pathogenesis and there are currently no evidence-based treatments available to treat or cure this disease. Genetics has provided a valuable tool for gaining insight into disease pathology. We recently completed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) in AA and successfully identified at least eight regions in the genome with evidence for association to AA. Importantly, this work identifies a discrete set of genes, some of which have been well studied within the context of other autoimmune diseases and already have targeted therapies available or in development. The insight that we have gained through our GWAS sets the stage for the rational development of novel effective therapeutic approaches and heralds in an exciting new era with the commencement of translational research in AA based on genetic findings.",

        "Abstract": "Hereditary leukonychia (porcelain nails or white nails) is a rare nail disorder with an unknown genetic basis. To identify variants in a gene underlying this phenotype, we identified four families of Pakistani origin showing features of hereditary leukonychia. All 20 nails of each affected individual were chalky and white in appearance, consistent with total leukonychia, with no other cutaneous, appendageal, or systemic findings. By using Affymetrix 10K chip, we established linkage to chromosome 3p21.3-p22 with a LOD score (Z) of 5.1. We identified pathogenic mutations in PLCD1 in all four families, which encodes phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C delta 1 subunit, a key enzyme in phosphoinositide metabolism. We then identified localization of PLCD1 in the nail matrix. It was recently shown that PLCD1 is a component of the human nail plate by proteomic analysis and is localized in the matrix of human nails. Furthermore, mutations detected in PLCD1 resulted in reduced enzymatic activity in\u00a0vitro. Our data show that mutations in PLCD1 underlie hereditary leukonychia, revealing a gene involved in molecular control of nail growth.",

        "Abstract": "Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have an unlimited proliferative capacity and extensive differentiation capability. They are an alternative source for regenerative therapies with a potential role in the treatment of several human diseases. The clinical use of ESCs, however, has significant ethical and biological obstacles related to their derivation from embryos and potential for immunological rejection, respectively. These disadvantages can be circumvented by the alternative use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which are generated from an individual's (autologous) somatic cells by exogenous expression of defined transcription factors and have biological characteristics similar to ESCs. In recent years, patient-specific iPSCs have been generated to study disease mechanisms and develop iPSC-based therapies. The development of iPSC-based therapies for skin diseases requires successful differentiation of iPSCs into cellular components of the skin, including epidermal keratinocytes. Here, we succeeded in generating iPSCs not only from normal human fibroblasts but also from fibroblasts isolated from the skin of two patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Moreover, we differentiated both of these iPSCs into keratinocytes with high efficiency, and generated 3D skin equivalents using iPSC-derived keratinocytes, suggesting that they were fully functional. Our studies indicate that autologous iPSCs have the potential to provide a source of cells for regenerative therapies for specific skin diseases.",

        "Title": "Genome-wide association study in alopecia areata implicates both innate and adaptive immunity.",
        "Abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is among the most highly prevalent human autoimmune diseases, leading to disfiguring hair loss due to the collapse of immune privilege of the hair follicle and subsequent autoimmune attack. The genetic basis of AA is largely unknown. We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a sample of 1,054 cases and 3,278 controls and identified 139 single nucleotide polymorphisms that are significantly associated with AA (P <or= 5 x 10(-7)). Here we show an association with genomic regions containing several genes controlling the activation and proliferation of regulatory T cells (T(reg) cells), cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), interleukin (IL)-2/IL-21, IL-2 receptor A (IL-2RA; CD25) and Eos (also known as Ikaros family zinc finger 4; IKZF4), as well as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. We also find association evidence for regions containing genes expressed in the hair follicle itself (PRDX5 and STX17). A region of strong association resides within the ULBP (cytomegalovirus UL16-binding protein) gene cluster on chromosome 6q25.1, encoding activating ligands of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2D that have not previously been implicated in an autoimmune disease. By probing the role of ULBP3 in disease pathogenesis, we also show that its expression in lesional scalp from patients with AA is markedly upregulated in the hair follicle dermal sheath during active disease. This study provides evidence for the involvement of both innate and acquired immunity in the pathogenesis of AA. We have defined the genetic underpinnings of AA, placing it within the context of shared pathways among autoimmune diseases, and implicating a novel disease mechanism, the upregulation of ULBP ligands, in triggering autoimmunity.",

        "Abstract": "The mammalian hair follicle (HF) is a complex structure composed of several distinct cell layers. The HF is an ectodermal appendage that resides in the skin, and unlike other tissues and organs, it possesses the remarkable ability to self-renew and undergoes a hair cycle that persists in adult life. Stem cells in the bulge region of the HF, as well as dermal papilla cells, play key roles in the regulation of successive hair cycles. Recent advances in molecular genetics have enabled the identification of many genes and pathways that are involved in HF morphogenesis and cycling. Furthermore, mutations in some of these genes are associated with hereditary hair diseases in humans. Identification of causative genes for hair diseases has provided a better understanding of the crucial roles of these genes in HF morphogenesis, development, and hair growth in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a severe inherited blistering disease caused by mutations in the type VII collagen gene, resulting in defective anchoring fibrils at the epidermal-dermal junction. At present, no curative treatment for RDEB exists. Mounting evidence on reprogramming of bone marrow stem cells into skin has prompted the authors and others to develop novel strategies for treatment of RDEB. The rationale for bone marrow stem cell therapies for RDEB is based on the evidence that bone marrow-derived cells are guided into becoming skin cells, given the right microenvironment. Preclinical studies in mouse models have shown that wild-type bone marrow-derived cells can ameliorate the phenotype of RDEB and improve survival by restoring the expression of type VII collagen and the anchoring fibrils. At present, several clinical studies are ongoing around the world to study the therapeutic effects of bone marrow stem cell transplantation for RDEB. These studies provide a framework for future development of standardized, effective methods for stem cell transplantation to cure severe inherited skin diseases, including RDEB.",

        "Abstract": "Hereditary hypotrichosis simplex is a rare autosomal dominant form of hair loss characterized by hair follicle miniaturization. Using genetic linkage analysis, we mapped a new locus for the disease to chromosome 18p11.22, and identified a mutation (Leu9Arg) in the adenomatosis polyposis down-regulated 1 (APCDD1) gene in three families. We show that APCDD1 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that is abundantly expressed in human hair follicles, and can interact in vitro with WNT3A and LRP5-two essential components of Wnt signalling. Functional studies show that APCDD1 inhibits Wnt signalling in a cell-autonomous manner and functions upstream of beta-catenin. Moreover, APCDD1 represses activation of Wnt reporters and target genes, and inhibits the biological effects of Wnt signalling during both the generation of neurons from progenitors in the developing chick nervous system, and axis specification in Xenopus laevis embryos. The mutation Leu9Arg is located in the signal peptide of APCDD1, and perturbs its translational processing from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. APCDD1(L9R) probably functions in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit the stability and membrane localization of the wild-type protein. These findings describe a novel inhibitor of the Wnt signalling pathway with an essential role in human hair growth. As APCDD1 is expressed in a broad repertoire of cell types, our findings indicate that APCDD1 may regulate a diversity of biological processes controlled by Wnt signalling.",

        "Title": "Autosomal-dominant woolly hair resulting from disruption of keratin 74 (KRT74), a potential determinant of human hair texture.",
        "Abstract": "Autosomal-dominant woolly hair (ADWH) is a rare disorder characterized by tightly curled hair. The molecular basis of ADWH has not previously been reported. In this study, we identified a Pakistani family with ADWH. The family showed linkage to chromosome 12q12-q14.1, containing the type II keratin gene cluster. We discovered a heterozygous mutation, p.Asn148Lys, within the helix initiation motif of the keratin 74 (KRT74) gene in all affected family members. KRT74 encodes the inner root sheath (IRS)-specific epithelial (soft) keratin 74. We demonstrate that the mutant K74 protein results in disruption of keratin intermediate filament formation in cultured cells, most likely in a dominant-negative manner. Furthermore, we sequenced the mouse Krt71-74 genes in the dominant Caracul-like 4 (Cal4) allele, which is characterized by a wavy-coat phenotype and maps to the same region of mouse chromosome 15 as the Caracul (Ca) and Reduced coat (Rco) alleles. We identified a heterozygous mutation, p.Glu440Lys, not in Krt74 but in the neighboring gene, Krt71. Krt71 was previously reported to harbor Ca and Rco mutations, as well as a coding SNP that is associated with curly-coated dogs. In this study, we define the ADWH phenotype resulting from a mutation in a hair-follicle-specific epithelial keratin in humans. Our findings not only further underscore the crucial roles of the IRS-specific epithelial keratin genes Krt71-74 in hair disorders but also open the possibility that these genes might function as genetic determinants of normal variation in hair texture across mammalian species.",

        "Abstract": "The hair fiber is made of specialized keratinocytes, known as trichocytes, that primarily express hair keratins, which are cemented by a multitude of keratin-associated proteins (KAPs). The hair keratins form the intermediate filament cytoskeleton of the trichocytes, which are linked to abundant cell-cell adhesion junctions, called desmosomes. Desmoglein 4 (DSG4) is the major desmosomal cadherin expressed in the hair shaft cortex where the hair keratins are highly expressed. In humans, mutations affecting either the hair keratins or DSG4 lead to beaded hair phenotypes with features of monilethrix. In this work, we postulated that the regulatory pathways governing the expression of hair shaft components, such as hair keratins and DSG4, are shared. Therefore, we studied the transcriptional regulation of DSG4 by transcription factors/pathways that are known regulators of hair keratin or KAP expression. We show that HOXC13, LEF1 and FOXN1 repress DSG4 transcription and provide in vitro and in vivo evidence correlating the Notch pathway with the activation and/or maintenance of DSG4 expression in the hair follicle.",

        "Abstract": "A key initial event in hair follicle morphogenesis is the localised thickening of the skin epithelium to form a placode, partitioning future hair follicle epithelium from interfollicular epidermis. Although many developmental signalling pathways are implicated in follicle morphogenesis, the role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, also known as FGF7) receptors are not defined. EGF receptor (EGFR) ligands have previously been shown to inhibit developing hair follicles; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been characterised. Here we show that receptors for EGF and KGF undergo marked downregulation in hair follicle placodes from multiple body sites, whereas the expression of endogenous ligands persist throughout hair follicle initiation. Using embryonic skin organ culture, we show that when skin from the sites of primary pelage and whisker follicle development is exposed to increased levels of two ectopic EGFR ligands (HBEGF and amphiregulin) and the FGFR2(IIIb) receptor ligand KGF, follicle formation is inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We then used downstream molecular markers and microarray profiling to provide evidence that, in response to KGF and EGF signalling, epidermal differentiation is promoted at the expense of hair follicle fate. We propose that hair follicle initiation in placodes requires downregulation of the two pathways in question, both of which are crucial for the ongoing development of the interfollicular epidermis. We have also uncovered a previously unrecognised role for KGF signalling in the formation of hair follicles in the mouse.",

        "Abstract": "Autozygosity mapping in consanguineous families has proven to be a powerful method for identifying recessive disease genes. Using this technique with whole genome SNP data generated from low density mapping arrays, we previously identified two genes that underlie autosomal recessive woolly hair (ARWH/hypotrichosis; OMIM278150), specifically P2RY5 and Lipase H (LIPH). In the current study, we sought to identify a novel disease locus for ARWH/hypotrichosis by analyzing two large consanguineous families from Pakistan who had initially been excluded for mutations at either of these disease loci by haplotype analysis with microsatellite markers. A genome-wide analysis of 10 members from each of the two families failed to identify significant regions of autozygosity or linkage. Upon genotyping an additional 10 family members in one of the families, parametric linkage analysis identified a region on chromosome 3q27 with evidence for linkage (Z = 2.5). Surprisingly, this region contains the LIPH gene. Microsatellite markers located within the LIPH gene were used for haplotype analysis and demonstrated that not one, but two haplotypes were segregating with the phenotype in each of these families. DNA sequencing identified two distinct LIPH mutations (280_369dup90 and 659_660delTA). Each affected individual (n = 38) was either homozygous for one mutation (n = 7 and 16 respectively), or compound heterozygous (n = 15). A review of the literature identified several reports of compound heterozygotes in consanguineous families. Prompted by this finding, we derived the probability that a patient affected with a recessive disease is carrying two mutations at the disease locus. We suggest that the validity of the IBD assumption may be challenged in large consanguineous families.",

        "Abstract": "Autosomal-recessive woolly hair (ARWH)/hypotrichosis is a hereditary hair disorder which is characterized by tightly curled hair and is associated with sparse hair. ARWH can be caused by mutations in the P2RY5 or lipase H (LIPH) gene. Disruption of either gene results in phenotypes with features of both wooly hair (WH) and hypotrichosis. In this study, we identified two Guyanese families with ARWH. Both families are of recent Indian descent. Mutation analysis resulted in the identification of mutations in the LIPH gene in both families. Affected individuals in the first family carry compound heterozygous mutations Ex7_8del and 1303_1309dupGAAAACG in the LIPH gene, while those in the second family have a homozygous mutation 659_660delTA in the LIPH gene. The mutations Ex7_8del and 659_660delTA were identified earlier in several Pakistani families with ARWH. Haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers close to the LIPH gene defined a founder haplotype shared in families from Pakistan and Guyana. Proteomic analysis of hair shaft samples from one of the families revealed no substantial changes among the proteins identified, indicating that the syndrome does not involve global alterations in protein expression. Our results further suggest a crucial role of LIPH gene in hair growth.",

The absence of type VII collagen production leads to the loss of adhesion at the basement membrane zone due to the absence of anchoring fibrils, which are composed of type VII collagen. We report that wild-type, congenic bone marrow cells homed to damaged skin, produced type VII collagen protein and anchoring fibrils, ameliorated skin fragility, and reduced lethality in the murine model of RDEB generated by targeted Col7a1 disruption. These data provide the first evidence that a population of marrow cells can correct the basement membrane zone defect found in mice with RDEB and offer a potentially valuable approach for treatment of human RDEB and other extracellular matrix disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Woolly hair (WH) is characterized by the presence of fine and tightly curled hair. WH can appear as a symptom of some systemic diseases, or without associated findings (nonsyndromic WH). Nonsyndromic WH is known to be inherited as either an autosomal-dominant (OMIM 194300) or recessive (ARWH; OMIM 278150) trait. In this study, we identified 11 consanguineous families of Pakistani origin with ARWH, as well as associated features including sparse and hypopigmented hair shafts. We first checked for mutations in the P2RY5 gene, which encodes an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor that we recently identified as a cause of ARWH. However, none of the 11 families had mutations in the P2RY5 gene. To identify the disease locus, we performed linkage studies in one of these families using the Affymetrix 10K array, and identified a region of suggestive linkage on chromosome 3q27. This region contains the lipase H (LIPH) gene which has been recently shown to underlie an autosomal-recessive form of hypotrichosis. Mutation analysis resulted in the identification of a total of 5 pathogenic mutations in the LIPH of all 11 families analyzed. These results show that LIPH is a second causative gene for ARWH/hypotrichosis, giving rise to a phenotype clinically indistinguishable from P2RY5 mutations.",

        "Title": "Autosomal recessive woolly hair with hypotrichosis caused by a novel homozygous mutation in the P2RY5 gene.",
        "Abstract": "During the last decade, several causative genes for hereditary hair diseases have been identified, which have disclosed the molecular mechanisms involved in hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling. We and others recently reported that mutations in the P2RY5 gene, encoding an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, underlie autosomal recessive woolly hair (WH)/hypotrichosis. Although these findings clearly reveal the involvement of P2RY5 mutations in hereditary hair diseases, the clinical manifestations of P2RY5 mutations have not completely been elucidated because of limited information to date. In this study, we ascertained a consanguineous family of Iranian origin with an affected girl showing sparse and hypopigmented scalp hair. She exhibited the WH phenotype with normal hair density at birth, but progressed with age to develop hypotrichosis. Direct sequencing analysis resulted in the identification of a novel homozygous mutation in the P2RY5 gene of the patient, which results in a non-conservative amino acid change, G146R, at the protein level. Our findings extend the mutation spectrum of P2RY5 mutations, and further support a crucial role of P2Y5 in hair growth in humans.",

        "Title": "A position effect on TRPS1 is associated with Ambras syndrome in humans and the Koala phenotype in mice.",
        "Abstract": "Ambras syndrome (AS) is a rare form of congenital hypertrichosis with excessive hair on the shoulders, face and ears. Cytogenetic studies have previously implicated an association with rearrangements of chromosome 8. Here we define an 11.5 Mb candidate interval for AS on chromosome 8q based on cytogenetic breakpoints in three patients. TRPS1, a gene within this interval, was deleted in a patient with an 8q23 chromosomal rearrangement, while its expression was significantly downregulated in another patient with an inversion breakpoint 7.3 Mb downstream of TRPS1. Here, we describe the first potential long-range position effect on the expression of TRPS1. To gain insight into the mechanisms by which Trps1 affects the hair follicle, we performed a detailed analysis of the hair abnormalities in Koa mice, a mouse model of hypertrichosis. We found that the proximal breakpoint of the Koa inversion is located 791 kb upstream of Trps1. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that Trps1 expression levels are reduced in Koa mutant mice at the sites of pathology for the phenotype. We determined that the Koa inversion creates a new Sp1 binding site and translocates additional Sp1 binding sites within a highly conserved stretch spanning the proximal breakpoint, providing a potential mechanism for the position effect. Collectively, these results describe a position effect that downregulates TRPS1 expression as the probable cause of hypertrichosis in AS in humans and the Koa phenotype in mice.",

        "Abstract": "While there have been significant advances in understanding the genetic etiology of human hair loss over the previous decade, there remain a number of hereditary disorders for which a causative gene has yet to be identified. We studied a large, consanguineous Brazilian family that presented with woolly hair at birth that progressed to severe hypotrichosis by the age of 5, in which 6 of the 14 offspring were affected. After exclusion of known candidate genes, a genome-wide scan was performed to identify the disease locus. Autozygosity mapping revealed a highly significant region of extended homozygosity (lod score of 10.41) that contained a haplotype with a linkage lod score of 3.28. Results of these two methods defined a 9-Mb region on chromosome 13q14.11-q14.2. The interval contains the P2RY5 gene, in which we recently identified pathogenic mutations in several families of Pakistani origin affected with autosomal recessive woolly and sparse hair. After the exclusion of several other candidate genes, we sequenced the P2RY5 gene and identified a homozygous mutation (C278Y) in all affected individuals in this family. Our findings show that mutations in P2RY5 display variable expressivity, underlying both hypotrichosis and woolly hair, and underscore the essential role of P2RY5 in the tissue integrity and maintenance of the hair follicle.",

        "Abstract": "We have previously shown that keratinocyte-specific deletion of Smad4, a TGFbeta/Activin/BMP signaling mediator, results in a progressive alopecia. To further assess the molecular mechanisms of Smad4 loss-mediated alopecia, we examined expression levels of key molecules associated with hair follicle differentiation in Smad4-deleted skin. Among them, Desmoglein 4 (Dsg4) was down-regulated in Smad4-deleted skin prior to the onset of hair follicle abnormalities with gradual depletion coinciding with hair follicle degeneration. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that Smad4, together with the BMP mediators Smad1 and Smad5, but not the TGFbeta/Activin mediators Smad2 or Smad3, bound to the Smad Binding Element (SBE) of the Dsg4 promoter. A Dsg4 reporter assay revealed that Smad4 was required for the maximal transactivation of Dsg4 in cooperation with Smad1 and Smad5. Mutating the SBE of the Dsg4 promoter abrogated Smad4 transactivation of Dsg4. Furthermore, BMP ligands, but not ligands of TGFbeta and Activin, induced endogenous Dsg4 expression. Our data demonstrate that in the presence of Smad4, BMP signaling participated in transcriptional regulation of Dsg4. Thus, Smad4 loss-associated Dsg4 depletion contributed, at least in part, to hair follicles degeneration in Smad4 deficient skin.",

        "Abstract": "The genetic determinants of hair texture in humans are largely unknown. Several human syndromes exist in which woolly hair comprises a part of the phenotype; however, simple autosomal recessive inheritance of isolated woolly hair has only rarely been reported. To identify a gene involved in controlling hair texture, we performed genetic linkage analysis in six families of Pakistani origin with autosomal recessive woolly hair (ARWH; OMIM 278150). All six families showed linkage to chromosome 13q14.2-14.3 (Z = 17.97). In all cases, we discovered pathogenic mutations in P2RY5, which encodes a G protein-coupled receptor and is a nested gene residing within intron 17 of the retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) gene.

Our findings indicate that disruption of P2RY5 underlies ARWH and, more broadly, uncover a new gene involved in determining hair texture in humans.",

        "Title": "Ligand-independent regulation of the hairless promoter by vitamin D receptor.",
        "Abstract": "The characteristic alopecia associated with mutations in the hairless (hr) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes defines the resulting genetic disorders, known as atrichia and VDRRIIa rickets, as phenocopies. In both cases, the separation of the dermal papilla from the regressing hair follicle at the onset of the first catagen phase of the hair cycle and the development of dermal cysts and utricules subsequent to mutation of either gene suggests that their activities affect the same regulatory pathways. VDR functions as a hormonally activated transcription factor, and a role in transcription has been postulated for Hr due in part to its nuclear localization and homology with the GATA-1 zinc-finger domain. Therefore, we examined the hypothesis that VDR and Hr have a direct regulatory effect on each other via a transcriptional mechanism. Ectopic expression of the VDR repressed hr promoter activity in HaCaT cells and primary human keratinocytes (PHKs). While this repression occurs in the absence of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3), the addition of ligand greatly augments the effect. However, we also demonstrate the rare phenomenon of ligand-independent promoter transactivation by VDR. We show that the full-length promoter is transactivated by VDR in a ligand-independent and cell type-specific manner, suggesting that direct transcriptional regulation of hr by the VDR accounts in part for the phenotypic overlap between atrichia and VDRRIIa rickets.",

        "Abstract": "P-cadherin is a member of the classical cadherin family that forms the transmembrane core of adherens junctions. Recently, mutations in the P-cadherin gene (CDH3) have been shown to cause two inherited diseases in humans: hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD) and ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly, macular dystrophy (EEM syndrome). The common features of both diseases are sparse hair and macular dystrophy of the retina, while only EEM syndrome shows the additional finding of split hand/foot malformation (SHFM). We identified five consanguineous Pakistani families with either HJMD or EEM syndrome, and detected pathogenic mutations in the CDH3 gene of all five families. In order to define the role of P-cadherin in hair follicle and limb development, we performed expression studies on P-cadherin in the mouse embryo, and demonstrated the predominant expression of P-cadherin not only in the hair follicle placode, but also at the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) of the limb bud. Based on the evidence that mutations in the p63 gene also result in hypotrichosis and SHFM, and that the expression patterns of p63 and P-cadherin overlap in the hair follicle placode and AER, we postulated that CDH3 could be a direct transcriptional target gene of p63. We performed promoter assays and ChIP, which revealed that p63 directly interacts with two distinct regions of the CDH3 promoter. We conclude that P-cadherin is a newly defined transcriptional target gene of p63, with a crucial role in hair follicle morphogenesis as well as the AER during limb bud outgrowth in humans, whereas it is not required for either in mice.",

In this study, Trps1 was identified by microarray hybridization analysis as having a complex pattern of spatiotemporal regulation in murine skin during morphogenesis. During early skin development, Trps1 expression decreased in the epidermis while simultaneously increasing in the dermis. Trps1 was specifically expressed in the nuclei of mesenchymal cells during hair follicle morphogenesis. An analysis of Trps1 expression during postnatal murine hair follicle cycling revealed that the protein localized to the nuclei of dermal papillae cells during telogen and anagen. Additionally, we found that Trps1 consistently localized to the nuclei of dermal papillae cells and the highly proliferative epithelial cells of mouse, rat and human hair follicles.",

Different desmosomal cadherins are differentially expressed in a tissue-specific as well as differentiation-dependent manner. The skin and the heart are two examples of tissues whose vital functions require the ability to endure mechanical stress, and therefore, rely on the integrity of desmosomal adhesion. When this adhesion is compromised via mutations in genes encoding desmosomal cadherins or associated plaque proteins, both tissues can suffer the consequences. Open questions revolve around whether the resulting phenotypes are solely because of physical disruption of cell adhesion or whether these events are coupled with signaling mechanisms that influence many additional cellular processes. In this review, we focus on new developments in desmosomal adhesion with an emphasis on the skin, hair, and heart.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, we reported that mutations in the R-spondin 4 (RSPO4) gene underlie inherited anonychia/hyponychia. Here, we studied five consanguineous Pakistani families with recessive inheritance of a combination of anonychia and hyponychia. Homozygous mutations were identified in the RSPO4 gene in all five families. Three families had a splice site mutation at the exon 2-intron 2 boundary. One family had a 26 bp deletion encompassing the start codon, and the final family had a missense mutation changing the initiating methionine to isoleucine. We demonstrated by in situ hybridization that Rspo4 is exclusively expressed in the mesenchyme underlying the digit tip epithelium in the mouse at embryonic day 14.5 (e14.5). These findings expand our understanding of the role of RSPO4 in nail development and disease.",

        "Title": "The Wnt inhibitor, Dickkopf 4, is induced by canonical Wnt signaling during ectodermal appendage morphogenesis.",
        "Abstract": "Ectodermal appendage morphogenesis requires continuous epithelial-mesenchymal cross-talk during development. Canonical Wnt signaling has been shown to be pivotal during this process and its inhibition leads to the absence of any morphological or molecular signs of appendage formation, including hair follicles (HFs). In the mouse, primary HFs arise in utero starting just before E14.5, when the first morphological signs of a placode are discernible. In this study, our goal was to identify novel factors expressed during primary HF morphogenesis. We performed transcriptional profiling of the developing epidermis at 12 h intervals between E12.5 and E15.5. One of the significantly differentially expressed genes was the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf 4, Dkk4. We show that Dkk4 mRNA increases sharply in the dorso-lateral epidermis around E14 and then decreases until E15.5. Using whole mount in situ hybridization, we show that Dkk4 mRNA is localized to the pre-placodes at sites of presumptive epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during appendage morphogenesis, including the dental lamina, mammary gland, eccrine gland, and primary and secondary HFs. In silico analysis, reporter gene assays as well as in vitro transfections of LEF1 and beta-catenin show that Dkk4 is a potential downstream target of canonical Wnt signaling. In addition, we demonstrate a direct physical interaction between LEF1/beta-catenin complex and the Dkk4 promoter using ChIP. We propose that Dkk4 acts in a negative feedback loop to attenuate canonical Wnt signaling, and may facilitate a switch to the non-canonical Wnt planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway that is involved in cell movements during morphogenesis.",

        "Title": "Transcriptional profiling of developing mouse epidermis reveals novel patterns of coordinated gene expression.",
        "Abstract": "The mammalian epidermis is the first line of defense against external environmental challenges including dehydration. The epidermis undergoes a highly intricate developmental program in utero, transforming from a simple to a complex stratified epithelium. During this process of stratification and differentiation, epidermal keratinocytes express a defined set of structural proteins, mainly keratins, whose expression is controlled by largely unknown mechanisms. In order to identify novel factors contributing to epidermal morphogenesis, we performed a global transcriptional analysis of the developing mouse epidermis after separating it from the underlying dermis (E12.5-E15.5). Unexpectedly, the recently identified genes encoding secreted peptides dermokine (Dmkn), keratinocyte differentiation-associated protein (krtdap), and suprabasin (Sbsn) as well as a largely uncharacterized embryonic keratin (Krt77), were among the most highly differentially expressed genes. The three genes encoding the secreted proteins form a cluster in an approximately 40-Kb locus on human chromosome 19 and the syntenic region on mouse chromosome 7 known as the stratified epithelium secreted peptides complex (SSC). Using whole mount in situ hybridization, we show that these genes show a coordinated spatio-temporal expression pattern during epidermal morphogenesis. The expression of these genes initiates in the nasal epithelium and correlates with the initiation of other epidermal differentiation markers such as K1 and loricrin (Byrne et al. [1994] Development 120:2369-2383), as well as the initiation of barrier formation. Our observations reveal a coordinated mode of expression of the SSC genes as well as the correlation of their initiation in the nasal epithelium with the initiation of barrier formation at this site.",

        "Title": "Genomewide scan for linkage reveals evidence of several susceptibility loci for alopecia areata.",
        "Abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is a genetically determined, immune-mediated disorder of the hair follicle that affects 1%-2% of the U.S. population. It is defined by a spectrum of severity that ranges from patchy localized hair loss on the scalp to the complete absence of hair everywhere on the body. In an effort to define the genetic basis of AA, we performed a genomewide search for linkage in 20 families with AA consisting of 102 affected and 118 unaffected individuals from the United States and Israel. Our analysis revealed evidence of at least four susceptibility loci on chromosomes 6, 10, 16 and 18, by use of several different statistical approaches. Fine-mapping analysis with additional families yielded a maximum multipoint LOD score of 3.93 on chromosome 18, a two-point affected sib pair (ASP) LOD score of 3.11 on chromosome 16, several ASP LOD scores >2.00 on chromosome 6q, and a haplotype-based relative risk LOD of 2.00 on chromosome 6p (in the major histocompatibility complex locus). Our findings confirm previous studies of association of the human leukocyte antigen locus with human AA, as well as the C3H-HeJ mouse model for AA. Interestingly, the major loci on chromosomes 16 and 18 coincide with loci for psoriasis reported elsewhere. These results suggest that these regions may harbor gene(s) involved in a number of different skin and hair disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Pathogenic glycine substitutions can cause destabilization of the triple helix and a diverse range of heritable connective tissue disorders, dependent on the collagen gene in which the mutation occurs. Mutations in the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) cause an inherited mechanobullous skin disease known as dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB). Typically, the dominant forms (DDEB) result from glycine substitutions within COL7A1, whereas other glycine mutations are 'silent' in the heterozygous state and produce disease only when they are homozygous. We studied three affected individuals from a large inbred Pakistani family with a history of skin fragility and scarring indicative of dystrophic EB. We identified a new glycine substitution within the collagenous region in exon 94 of the COL7A1 gene. This mutation, designated G2422V, resulted in a glycine (GGA) to valine (GTA) substitution presumably causing a destabilization of the protein by interrupting the Gly-X-Y repeats. This finding expands the allelic series of COL7A1 mutations underlying mild recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) and sheds further light upon regions of the type VII collagen triple helix that are tolerant of heterozygous glycine substitutions.",

        "Abstract": "Skin and bone - what comes to mind at hearing this phrase? While certainly a metaphor for disease, it also defines two very different tissues, one a flexible and contiguous outer covering, the other a morphologically diverse hard tissue distributed at over 200 sites in the body. As the accompanying series of Reviews highlights, these tissues are indeed diverse, but there are also surprising similarities. Skin is the interface between the internal organs and the environment, and as such plays a crucial role in the body's defense mechanism. The skin and its many appendages are responsible for functions as diverse as epidermal barrier and defense, immune surveillance, UV protection, thermoregulation, sweating, lubrication, pigmentation, the sensations of pain and touch, and, importantly, the protection of various stem cell niches in the skin. Bone serves a number of purposes: it provides protection for vital organs, a lever for locomotion, a reservoir for calcium, and the site of adult hematopoiesis. The tissue is composed of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and their individual precursors plus a complex mixture of mesenchymal, myeloid, and lymphoid cells in the marrow space. Finally, the endothelial microenvironment provides nutrition and is a conduit for the influx and emigration of cells that impact bone biology in several important ways. This Review series guides the reader through these various facets of 2 diverse, yet interdependent, tissues.",

        "Abstract": "Localized autosomal recessive hypotrichosis (LAH) is a recently defined disorder characterized by fragile, short, sparse hairs on the scalp, trunk, and extremities. Mutations in desmoglein 4 (DSG4), a novel member of the desmosomal cadherin family that is expressed in the hair follicle as well as the suprabasal epidermis, have been found to underlie LAH. Thus far, the allelic series includes a recurrent intragenic deletion identified in affected Pakastani kindreds and a missense mutation detected in an Iraqi family. We report three siblings of Iraqi and Iranian origin with LAH that presented with congenital scalp erosions and monilethrix-like hairs, features that have not been previously described in this disorder. Follicular hyperkeratotic papules and marked pruritus were also prominent clinical findings. Novel compound heterozygous DSG4 mutations, including a splice-site mutation and a missense mutation that disrupts a conserved calcium-binding site in the extracellular (EC)2-EC3 interface, were found to underlie the disease in this family. These observations broaden the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of LAH, further illustrating the consequences of DSG4 dysfunction on epidermal and hair shaft integrity.",

        "Abstract": "Desmosomes are critical for the tissue integrity of stratified epithelia and their appendages. Desmogleins (DSGs) and desmocollins (DSCs) are transmembrane desmosomal cadherins that interact extracellularly to link neighboring epithelial cells. We recently identified a new member of the DSG family, designated desmoglein 4, whose mutations cause hypotrichosis in human, mouse and rat. In this study, we analyzed in detail the expression domains of human desmoglein 4 protein (DSG4) in human skin relative to differentiation markers and other DSGs. Our results show that DSG4 protein is expressed in the more highly differentiated layers of the epidermis. This expression pattern in vivo is recapitulated in highly differentiated HaCaT human keratinocytes and normal human keratinocytes in vitro. In the human hair follicle, DSG4 is expressed specifically in the hair shaft cortex, the lower hair cuticle, and the upper inner root sheath (IRS) cuticle. Using a green fluorescent protein-tagged version of mouse or rat desmoglein 4 protein (Dsg4) and immuno-electron microscopy, we demonstrate that Dsg4 localizes to desmosomes both in vitro and in vivo. The highly specific expression pattern of DSG4 in the human hair follicle, combined with the phenotype of rodent models and human patients with desmoglein 4 mutations, underscores the importance of this adhesion molecule in the integrity of the hair shaft.",

        "Abstract": "Desmogleins play critical roles in cell adhesion and skin blistering diseases, as they are the target antigens of autoimmune antibodies and bacterial toxins. We recently cloned several novel members of the desmoglein gene family, bringing the number of desmogleins to four in the rat and human genomes and six in the mouse. Here, we have produced a monoclonal antibody to a cytoplasmic epitope of Dsg4, assessed its specificity and compared it to several existing Dsg1-3 antibodies. We also demonstrated cross-reactivity of commercially available and often used Dsg1 antibodies. Using these tools, we delineated the unique expression patterns of each desmoglein isoform in various human and mouse stratified squamous epithelia, including skin, hair, palm, and oral mucosa. Interestingly, in the epidermis, the expression of each desmoglein correlates with their gene arrangement in the cadherin locus. In human, Dsg4 was detected primarily in the granular and cornified cell layers of the epidermis, while present throughout all differentiated layers of the oral mucosa and palm, and in the matrix cells of anagen hair bulb. Similar pattern of expression for Dsg4 was observed in mouse, with the exception that it was expressed at significantly lower levels in the mouse epidermis. These results demonstrate the complexity of desmoglein gene expression and provide additional insights into the correlation between tissue expression patterns and disease phenotypes.",

        "Abstract": "A newly defined form of inherited hair loss, named localized autosomal recessive hypotrichosis (LAH, OMIM 607903), was recently described in the literature and shown to be linked to chromosome 18. A large, intragenic deletion in the desmoglein 4 gene (DSG4) as the underlying mutation in several unrelated families of Pakistani origin. LAH is an autosomal recessive form of hypotrichosis affecting the scalp, trunk, and extremities, and largely sparing the facial, pubic, and axillary hair. Typical hairs are fragile and break easily, leaving short sparse scalp hairs with a characteristic appearance. Using comparative genomics, we also demonstrated that human LAH is allelic with the lanceolate hair (lah) mouse, as well as the lanceolate hair (lah) rat phenotype. Together, these models provide new information about the role of desmosomal cadherins in disease, and serve as in vivo models for functional and mechanistic studies into the role of desmoglein 4 in the skin and hair follicle.",

Since the establishment of hairless (HR) gene mutations as the cause of this disorder, several patients previously assumed to suffer from alopecia universalis have been subsequently diagnosed with APL. In this study we have identified a novel splicing mutation, IVS8+2T-->G, in the hairless gene. This mutation most likely abolishes normal splicing of exon 8 and potentially leads to out-of-frame skipping of this exon and a downstream premature termination codon (PTC). Our findings contribute to the growing body of HR mutations implicated in APL and provide further evidence for the differentiation of APL from alopecia universalis.",

        "Title": "Germline fumarate hydratase mutations and evidence for a founder mutation underlying multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomata.",
        "Abstract": "Multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomata syndrome (MCL) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by the presence of concurrent benign tumors of smooth muscle origin (leiomyoma) in the skin and uterus of affected females, and in the skin of affected males. MCL can also be associated with type II papillary renal cell cancer (HLRCC). The genetic locus for MCL and HLRCC was recently mapped to chromosome 1q42.3-43 and subsequently, dominantly inherited mutations in the fumarate hydratase gene ( FH ) were identified. Importantly, analysis of the FH gene in tumors of MCL patients revealed a second mutation inactivating the wild-type allele in some tumors. Based on these findings, it has been suggested that FH may function as a tumor suppressor gene in MCL. Here, we report the analysis of the FH gene in a group of 11 MCL families, with the identification of 8 different mutations accounting for the disease in all families. One of the mutations, 905-1G>A, has been identified in 4 families of Iranian origin. The analysis of highly polymorphic markers in the vicinity of the FH gene showed a shared haplotype in these 4 families, suggesting that 905-1G>A represents a founder mutation. Collectively, identification of 5 novel and 3 recurrent mutations further supports the role of FH in the pathogenesis of MCL.",

        "Abstract": "The esterification of alcohols such as sterols, diacylglycerols, and monoacylglycerols with fatty acids represents the formation of both storage and cytoprotective molecules. Conversely, the overproduction of these molecules is associated with several disease pathologies, including atherosclerosis and obesity. The human acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 2 gene superfamily comprises seven members, four of which have been previously implicated in the synthesis of di- or triacylglycerol. The remaining 3 members comprise an X-linked locus and have not been characterized. We describe here the expression of DGAT2 and the three X-linked genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains virtually devoid of neutral lipids. All four gene products mediate the synthesis of triacylglycerol; however, two of the X-linked genes act as acyl-CoA wax alcohol acyltransferases (AWAT 1 and 2) that predominantly esterify long chain (wax) alcohols with acyl-CoA-derived fatty acids to produce wax esters. AWAT1 and AWAT2 have very distinct substrate preferences in terms of alcohol chain length and fatty acyl saturation. The enzymes are expressed in many human tissues but predominate in skin. In situ hybridizations demonstrate a differentiation-specific expression pattern within the human sebaceous gland for the two AWAT genes, consistent with a significant role in the composition of sebum.",

        "Abstract": "We have identified C7orf11, which localizes to the nucleus and is expressed in fetal hair follicles, as the first disease gene for nonphotosensitive trichothiodystrophy (TTD). C7orf11 maps to chromosome 7p14, and the disease locus has been designated \"TTDN1\" (TTD nonphotosensitive 1). Mutations were found in patients with Amish brittle-hair syndrome and in other nonphotosensititive TTD cases with mental retardation and decreased fertility but not in patients with Sabinas syndrome or Pollitt syndrome. Therefore, genetic heterogeneity in nonphotosensitive TTD is a feature similar to that observed in photosensitive TTD, which is caused by mutations in transcription factor II H (TFIIH) subunit genes. Comparative immunofluorescence analysis, however, suggests that C7orf11 does not influence TFIIH directly. Given the absence of cutaneous photosensitivity in the patients with C7orf11 mutations, together with the protein's nuclear localization, C7orf11 may be involved in transcription but not DNA repair.",

        "Abstract": "A recessive hairless mutation arose spontaneously in a congenic line of spontaneously hypertensive rats SHR.BN-(D1Mit3-Igf2)/Ipcv. The mutant rats develop generalized alopecia except for partial hair growth on their heads. Affected animals of the congenic line were crossed with LEW rats and randomly bred for several generations. A genome scan in 74 affected and 75 unaffected offspring localized the mutant gene on rat chromosome 18p12, near the marker D18Rat107, which is closely linked to the desmosomal cadherin gene cluster, syntenic to mouse chromosome 18 and human chromosome 18q12. Recently, the mouse and rat phenotypes lah/lah (lanceolate hair) and lah(J)/lah(J)(lanceolate hair-J) were found to be caused by mutations in the desmoglein 4 (Dsg4) gene. Direct sequencing of the Dsg4 gene in the SHR revealed a homozygous C-to-T transition generating a premature termination codon within exon 8 in the affected animals. Further studies on the skin histology in affected rats demonstrated features consistent with a lanceolate hair mutation, providing further support for the crucial role of desmoglein 4 in hair shaft differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "The Iffa Credo (IC) \"hairless\" rat is an autosomal recessive hypotrichotic animal model actively used in pharmacological and dermatological studies. Although the molecular basis of the IC rat phenotype was never defined, the designation \"hr/hr\" (hairless) has been used for this rat mutation. Despite the observation that IC rats share many phenotypic similarities with Charles River (CR) 'hairless rats', crossbreeding between CR and IC rats indicated that these mutations are not allelic, and moreover, genetic analysis of both CR and IC hairless mutant rats showed no mutations in the hr gene. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the skin phenotype in the IC rat. While the initial stages of hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis reveal no significant abnormalities, the subsequent processes of inner root sheath and hair shaft formation are severely disturbed due to impaired proliferation in the hair matrix and abnormal differentiation in the precortex zone. This results in significant reduction of hair bulb volume, and the formation of dysmorphic \"blebbed\" hair shafts lacking medullar structure and resembling \"lanceolate\" hairs. Based on the presence of lance-head hairs typical of rodent lanceolate mutants, we performed molecular analysis of the desmoglein 4 gene and found a large intragenic deletion encompassing nine exons of the gene. This finding, together with specific morphological features of skin and hairs, confirms that the IC rat is allelic with the lanceolate hair (lah) mutations in mice and rats. Our results elucidate the genetic and morphological basis of the IC rat mutation, thus providing a new model to study molecular mechanisms of hair growth control.",

        "Abstract": "The four isoforms of desmosomal cadherin desmogleins (Dsg1-4) are expressed in epithelial tissues in a differentiation-specific manner. Extensive sequencing of the human genome has revealed only one copy of the Dsg1 gene. However, we recently cloned two novel additional mouse Dsg1 genes, Dsg1-beta and -gamma, which flank the original Dsg1-alpha on chromosome 18. Sequence conservation between the Dsg1 isoforms diverged significantly at exon 11, particularly in the region that encodes for the extracellular anchoring (EA) domains. Computational analysis revealed very low hydrophilic potential of the Dsg1-gamma EA compared with the corresponding sequences of Dsg1-alpha and -beta, suggesting that the Dsg1-gamma EA domain may have a stronger affinity to the cell membrane. We generated antibodies using synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins localized within the EA domains. These antibodies were tested for their specificity and were then used to demonstrate expression of Dsg1 isoforms in various tissues. In the epidermis, all Dsg1 isoforms were differentially expressed in the differentiating cell layers. In the hair follicle, all Dsg1 isoforms were present throughout the entire process of its development and cycling but the expression of Dsg1 isoforms is subject to significant hair cycle-dependent changes. Dsg1-beta and -gamma, but not Dsg1-alpha, were detected in the sebaceous gland epithelium and the stratified epithelium of the stomach. Finally, Dsg1-alpha and Dsg1-beta, but not Dsg1-gamma, are proteolytically cleaved by exfoliative toxin A. These results suggest that the developmental complexity of mouse tissues, including skin and hair, may play a significant role in the evolutionary driving force to maintain multiple Dsg1 genes in mouse.",

        "Title": "Hairless contains a novel nuclear matrix targeting signal and associates with histone deacetylase 3 in nuclear speckles.",
        "Abstract": "Hair follicle cycling is a highly regulated and dynamic cellular process consisting of phases of growth, regression, and quiescence. The hairless (hr) gene encodes a nuclear factor that is highly expressed in the skin, where it appears to be an essential regulator during the regression in the catagen hair follicle. In hairless mice, as well as humans with congenital atrichia, the absence of hr protein initiates a premature and abnormal catagen due to defects in the signaling required for hair follicle remodeling. Here, we report that hr protein is a nuclear protein that is tightly associated with the nuclear matrix scaffold. Using a series of deletion constructs of the mouse hr gene, we monitored the sub-cellular localization of the recombinant protein by in situ immunolocalization and biochemical fractionation after nuclear matrix extraction of transiently transfected cells. We identified a novel nuclear matrix-targeting signal (NMTS) in the hr protein and mapped the domain to amino acid residues 111-186 of the mouse hr sequence. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this region not only mediates the interaction of hr with components of the nuclear architecture, but also specifies the sub-nuclear location of the hr protein to nuclear domains containing deacetylase activity. The N-terminal region directs hr to a speckled nuclear pattern that co-localizes with the histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC), but not with HDAC1 or HDAC7. Based on our findings, we propose that hr protein is part of a specific multi-protein repressor complex and that hr may be involved in chromatin remodeling.",

To study the role of Notch1 in epidermal differentiation and the development of the various cell types within the mouse hair follicle, we generated transgenic mice that express a constitutive activated form of Notch1 under the control of the involucrin promoter. Transgenic animals express the transgene in the suprabasal epidermal keratinocytes and inner root sheath of the hair follicle, and develop both skin and hair abnormalities. Notch1 overexpression leads to an increase of the differentiated cell compartment in the epidermis, delays inner root sheath differentiation, and leads to hair shaft abnormalities and alopecia associated with the anagen phase of the hair cycle.",

        "Abstract": "More than 25 different hypotrichotic mutations have been described in laboratory rats, yet the molecular basis for these mutations has not been determined for most of these phenotypes. Their similarity to the hairless (hr) mutations described in mice suggests a possible role for the hairless gene in the formation of rat hypotrichotic phenotypes, though whether hr is responsible for these rat phenotypes has yet to be determined. Therefore, in order to understand the basis for the rat hypotrichotic phenotypes and their relationship to the hr gene, we determined the genomic organization of the hr gene and subsequently analyzed the coding sequence in four hypotrichotic rat strains. Analysis revealed that the first two exons of the mouse, monkey, and human hr gene were fused in the rat gene, while the rest of the gene showed strong evolutionary conservation. Despite their designation as \"hairless,\" no mutations within the coding sequences were identified, indicating that the \"hairless\" phenotype in all four hypotrichotic rat strains are not allelic with hr.",

        "Abstract": "Both the production of the hair shaft in anagen and the initiation of a new hair cycle at telogen are the result of reciprocal interactions between the dermal papilla and the overlying epithelial cells. Secreted factors, such as those of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, play a crucial role in moderating these interactions. Analysis of hair follicles in different stages of the hair cycle showed that BMP signalling was only active during anagen and again during telogen. During catagen, no BMP signalling occurred in the dermal papilla. ID3, a gene expressed in the dermal papilla of both vibrissa and pelage follicles, is a BMP target, and as such, we found that ID3 was expressed from the earliest stages of morphogenesis. During the hair cycle, ID3 was only expressed in the dermal papilla at middle anagen and telogen. To test the significance of ID3 expression in the dermal papilla, we cultured dermal papilla cells and found that ID3 expression fell significantly after a single passage. ID3 expression was returned to in vivo levels in low- and high-passage cells by culturing to high confluence or by the addition of BMP4. These studies reinforce the requirement for active BMP signalling and cell-cell contacts in the dermal papilla during specific stages in the hair cycle.",

        "Abstract": "We used microarray hybridization to identify genes induced in the dermal papilla (DP) during anagen as a result of the interaction with epithelial matrix cells. We identified inhibitors of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-signalling pathway, as well as the rat homologue of the Xenopus-secreted WNT modulator Wise. A large number of genes previously determined to be expressed in the DP were shown to be expressed in both the DP and dermal sheath (DS). Genes induced in the DP during anagen included modulators of genes expressed additionally in the DS as well as specialized extracellular matrix components. Expression of some of these genes were lost when the DP cells were cultured, suggesting that their expression was interaction dependent. One such gene, the WNT-signalling modulator Wise, was expressed in the DP and not in the non-inductive DS and was additionally expressed at high levels in the precortex and in the putative bulge region. In addition to the reported WNT-signalling modulation role, we show that Wise reduced both BMP and TGFbeta signalling in transformed fibroblasts. We speculate that loss of gene expression in cultured cells is a model for the loss of gene expression observed at catagen.",

        "Abstract": "Desmosomal cadherins are a family of calcium regulated proteins involved in the formation of desmosomes, a type of cell junction important in maintaining cell adhesion and tissue stability. The desmosomal plaque consists of members of the desmosomal cadherin, plakin and armadillo family of proteins. Desmosomal cadherins are transmembrane glycoproteins that interact with desmosomal cadherins of the adjacent cells via their extracellular repeat domains and are divided in two subfamilies, the desmogleins (Dsg) and the desmocollins (Dsc). On the cytoplasmic side, the cadherins connect to the intermediate filament (IF) network indirectly by interacting with plakin and armadillo proteins. Here, we report the elucidation of the genomic structure of two mouse desmocollin genes, Dsc2 and Dsc3. Interestingly, at the genomic level, desmocollins show a higher degree of similarity to the classical cadherins, such as E-cadherin, than to the desmogleins.",

In this review, we discuss how our current understanding of these processes has been made possible by the elucidation of the molecular basis of human inherited diseases and mouse mutants which display defects in the hair and epidermis. For examples, the study of ectodermal dysplasias and the basal cell carcinoma predisposition disease Gorlin syndrome have allowed the determination of signalling hierarchies critical in the formation of the hair follicle. Epidermolytic diseases and hyperkeratoses have focussed attention on the importance of the programs of keratin expression, while ichthyoses provide insight in the final stage of epidermal development, cornification. Finally, the increasing range of diseases and mouse models exhibiting alopecias are revealing the critical pathways in control of the hair follicle cycle.",

        "Abstract": "Although loricrin is the predominant protein of the cornified envelope (CE) in keratinocytes, loss or gain of loricrin function in mouse models produces only modest skin phenotypes. In contrast, insertional mutations resulting in a frameshift in the C-terminal domain of loricrin produce the characteristic ichthyosis of loricrin keratoderma in mouse and man. To ascertain the basis for the loricrin keratoderma phenotype, we assessed epidermal structure and stratum corneum (SC) function in a previously genotyped human loricrin keratoderma kindred. Our studies revealed abnormal corneocyte fragility and basal permeability barrier function, but accelerated repair kinetics. Despite fragility, increased water loss occurred predominantly via extracellular domains, which correlated with disorganized lamellar bilayers that were linked spatially to discontinuities of the CE. Accelerated barrier recovery was explicable by amplified lamellar body secretion, while partial normalization of the CE in the outer SC correlated with persistence of abundant calcium in the extracellular spaces (positioned to activate transglutaminase-1). These results show that the barrier abnormality in loricrin keratoderma is linked to a defective CE scaffold, resulting in increased extracellular permeability, as shown previously for another \"scaffold disorder\", lamellar ichthyosis. But in contrast to lamellar ichthyosis, the CE scaffold partially normalizes in the outer SC in loricrin keratoderma.",

        "Abstract": "The hair cycle is an extraordinarily complex process relying on spatially and temporally coordinated integration of intercellular signaling, cell division and death, cell migration, and gene expression. The hairless gene (hr) is expressed with hair-cycle-dependent kinetics, and pathogenic mutations in hr are responsible for the hairless and rhino phenotypes in mice and atrichia with papular lesions in humans. In addition to its expression in the skin and hair follicle, hr is also highly expressed in the brain, yet the factors governing its differential cell-type-specific expression have not yet been defined. A thyroid hormone responsive element was previously identified in the rat hr promoter which confers thyroid hormone (T3) responsiveness to heterologous promoter constructs; however, prior studies have not focused on the hr promoter itself. The hairless promoter was cloned, and it is shown that the hr promoter is transactivated by T3 in neuroblastoma cells but not in keratinocytes. Therefore, while T3 has a significant role in the regulation of neuronal expression of hairless, its upregulation in keratinocytes is T3 independent. Furthermore, hr is subject to cell-type-specific negative autoregulation, inhibiting the activity of its own promoter in keratinocytes but not neuroblastoma cells. These findings illustrate a molecular distinction between the regulation of hr expression in defined cell populations.",

        "Abstract": "Atrichia with papular lesions (APL) (MIM 209 500) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by early onset of atrichia, followed by a papular eruption within the first years of life. Recent studies demonstrating linkage to chromosome 8p21 and further mutation detection in the hairless gene (HR) have established the molecular basis of APL. This study describes the case of a 16-year-old female with APL due to a missense mutation, D1012N, in the hr-thyroid hormone receptor interacting domain 2 (TRID2) of the HR. Using functional and biochemical analysis, it was determined that this mutation does not significantly affect hr-thyroid hormone receptor interaction. This result suggests that the TRID2 domain either is dispensable in the hr-TR interaction or is not involved in the pathogenesis of APL.",

        "Abstract": "Desmosomal cadherins are essential cell adhesion molecules present throughout the epidermis and other organs, whose major function is to provide mechanical integrity and stability to epithelial cells in a wide variety of tissues. We recently identified a novel desmoglein family member, Desmoglein 4 (Dsg4), using a positional cloning approach in two families with localized autosomal recessive hypotrichosis (LAH) and in the lanceolate hair (lah) mouse. In this study, we report cloning and identification of the rat Dsg4 gene, in which we discovered a missense mutation in a naturally occurring lanceolate hair (lah) rat mutant. Phenotypic analysis of lah/lah mutant rats revealed a striking hair shaft defect with the appearance of a lance head within defective hair shafts. The mutation disrupts a critical calcium binding site bridging the second and third extracellular domains of Dsg4, likely disrupting extracellular interactions of the protein.",

        "Abstract": "Ribozyme technology is widely used to target mRNA in a sequence-specific fashion and thus change the expression pattern of cells or tissues. While the goal of mRNA targeting is usually the cleavage of mutant mRNAs with the prospect of gene therapy for inherited diseases, in certain instances, targeting of wild-type genes can be used therapeutically. Lack of expression of the mouse hairless gene due to inherited mutations leads to the complete and irreversible loss of hair known as atrichia. We designed this study to recapitulate the hairless phenotype in a restricted manner by topical application of deoxyribozyme-targeting molecules to specifically cleave the mouse hairless mRNA. Histological samples taken from treated skin at different times demonstrated a decreased number of hair follicles, an involution of the remaining follicles, a separation of the dermal papillae, and the presence of dermal cysts, all characteristics of the hairless phenotype, but not normally present in the skin of C57Bl/6 J mice. In this study, we successfully recapitulated the hairless phenotype using topically applied target-specific catalytic oligonucleotides designed to cleave the mouse hairless mRNA. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using ribozyme technology to alter the gene expression in the skin via topical application and provide proof of principle for the development of this strategy for permanent hair removal.",

Further this technology has widespread utility in the treatment of any disease, acquired or inherited, by inhibition of gene expression. The design of ribozymes is usually accomplished using computer assisted design programs, however they are not very useful in predicting the behavior of the ribozyme in the in vivo setting. To overcome this technical challenge, we developed a simple in vivo strategy to accurately assess the efficiency of ribozyme cleavage that significantly enhances the computer based design programs.",

Atrichia with papules also occurs in the clinical setting of vitamin D-dependent rickets type IIA (VDDR IIA; OMIM 277440), resulting from mutations in the vitamin D receptor gene on chromosome 12q12-q14. Despite the distinct genetic basis for both forms of atrichia, the clinical findings are strikingly similar and exhibit classic pathognomonic features unique to this phenotype.

MCL is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, manifesting as skin leiomyoma and uterine fibroids in affected individuals. Fumarate hydratase, a component of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, acts as a tumor suppressor gene in the development of cutaneous and uterine leiomyoma and renal cell cancer in this syndrome. Here we report the clinical and mutational analysis of five families with MCL, with the identification of five new mutations affecting highly conserved residues of the FH protein. These results provide further evidence for the role of the FH gene in the pathogenesis of MCL.",

        "Abstract": "Alopecia areata affects approximately 4.6 million individuals in the United States alone. It is typified by patchy hair loss on the scalp that can progress to cover the entire scalp (alopecia totalis) and eventually the entire body (alopecia universalis). Despite the high incidence of this condition, its genetic basis is largely unknown. It is now generally accepted, however, that it fits the paradigm of a complex trait, in which a combination of genetic and environmental factors results in the final phenotype. Genetic studies have been limited thus far to association analyses, which suggest that a permissive HLA status may potentiate the development of alopecia areata. A systematic screen for identifying the primary genetic mechanisms underlying this disorder has never before been undertaken, however. Here we discuss our approach to the identification of susceptibility genes for alopecia areata. In particular, we recently initiated a comprehensive genetic analysis by performing a genome-wide scan in a collection of alopecia families with multiple affected family members. There are currently a number of examples of complex diseases of the skin, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, in which genetic studies are being undertaken that substantiate the timeliness of this approach. We anticipate that these studies will lead to the identification of the susceptibility genes and provide a foundation for understanding how they interact with each other and with other variables, such as the immune system and environmental factors.",

We report a four-generation kindred originating from Iran-Syria in which three members were affected with PPKS. Clinically, these patients present with hyperkeratotic palms and plantar plaques. Direct DNA sequencing analysis revealed a heterozygous C-to-A transversion at nt 395 of the DSG1 gene. This mutation converted a serine residue (TCA) in exon 5 to a nonsense mutation (TAA) designated S132X. The mutation identified in this study is a novel mutation in the DSG1 gene and extends the body of evidence implicating the desmoglein gene family in the pathogenesis of human skin disorders.",

        "Abstract": "The Workshop on the morphological approach to hair disorders brought together a group of clinicians involved in hair biology research. Six speakers spoke on a range of topics that can be grouped broadly into a central theme. It summarizes the evolution of medical research. The section by Tosti and coworkers describes a patient with a new unique syndrome. The section by Ferrando and colleagues provides a framework in which patients with rare hair disorders can be classified. The section by Whiting tries to define the normal anatomy of the hair follicle and both horizontal and vertical sections. It is only when normal anatomy has been absolutely defined that pathological deviations can be recognized. The section by Sinclair and coworkers attempts to estimate the reliability of histological diagnosis so that its true value of pathology can be recognized. The section by Zlotogorski and coworkers shows how accurate clinical and histological definition of disease acts as the cornerstone for gene discovery techniques. Once a causative mutation is found and a gene product identified, then the biological consequences of the altered protein product can be studied and the impact of the abnormal molecular function on hair biology can be understood. It is hoped that improved understanding of hair disease will then lead to useful therapeutic interventions. The final section by Leroy and Van Neste highlights the difficulties of evaluating therapeutic interventions in hair loss disease and proposes a new technique.",

        "Abstract": "The workshop on Hair Follicle Stem Cells brought together investigators who have used a variety of approaches to try to understand the biology of follicular epithelial stem cells, and the role that these cells play in regulating the hair cycle. One of the main concepts to emerge from this workshop is that follicular epithelial stem cells are multipotent, capable of giving rise not only to all the cell types of the hair, but also to the epidermis and the sebaceous gland. Furthermore, such multipotent stem cells may represent the ultimate epidermal stem cell. Another example of epithelial stem cell and transit amplifying cell plasticity, was the demonstration that adult corneal epithelium, under the influence of embryonic skin dermis could form an epidermis as well as hair follicles. With regards to the location of follicular epithelial stem cells, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural data was presented, indicating that cells with stem cell attributes were localized to the prominent bulge region of developing human fetal hair follicles. Finally, a new notion was put forth concerning the roles that the bulge-located stem cells and the hair germ cells played with respect to the hair cycle.",

        "Title": "Expression patterns of the transcription factor AP-2alpha during hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling.",
        "Abstract": "AP-2alpha is a member of a family of transcription factors expressed in cells of the epithelial and neural crest lineage. AP-2alpha plays an essential role in embryonic development and in regulation of epithelial gene transcription. To further characterize the role of AP-2alpha in skin biology, we assessed its expression in the skin of C57BL/6J mice during defined stages of hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling. During early hair follicle morphogenesis, AP-2alpha was upregulated in the epidermal placode, in the basal keratinocytes of the hair follicle bud, and then in the inner root sheath. The follicular papilla cells underwent a brief upregulation of AP-2alpha expression during the initiation of hair shaft formation and active hair follicle downward growth. Completion of hair follicle morphogenesis was associated with a marked reduction of AP-2alpha immunoreactivity in the lower portion of the hair follicle including both epithelial and mesenchymal compartments. In adolescent mouse skin, consistently strong AP-2alpha expression was found in the basal keratinocytes of the epidermis, in the hair follicle infundibulum, and in the sebocytes. In the follicular papilla, AP-2alpha was weakly expressed in telogen, significantly upregulated in early anagen, then gradually declined, and reappeared again in middle catagen. In the inner root sheaths, AP-2alpha expression was detected during early and middle anagen and during middle catagen stages. Prominent AP-2alpha expression was also seen in the zone of club hair formation. Therefore, AP-2alpha upregulation in both epithelial and mesenchymal hair follicle compartments was coordinated with initiation of major remodeling processes. Our findings support the use of the hair follicle as a model to explore the role of AP-2alpha in physiologic remodeling of developing organs and in reciprocal ectodermal-mesenchymal interactions.",

        "Abstract": "Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of inherited disorders characterized by increased skin fragility, resulting in blisters and erosions after minor trauma. Mutations in 10 structural genes expressed in the cutaneous basement membrane zone have been reported. The DebRA Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at Jefferson Medical College has performed 144 DNA-based prenatal diagnoses since 1993 in families at risk for recurrence of the most severe forms of EB, including the recessive dystrophic EB (RDEB), junctional EB (JEB), EB with pyloric atresia (EB-PA), and EB simplex (EBS). A mutation-detection strategy using either conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) or denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) scanning analysis, followed by nucleotide sequencing, was applied to most cases with DEB and to all JEB, EB-PA, and EBS families. For some RDEB families, linkage analysis was performed, either alone when the inheritance pattern was clear or in combination with one mutation. Among the 144 prenatal diagnoses, 63 were for RDEB, 69 for JEB, 6 for EB-PA, and 6 for EBS. Twenty-eight normal, 73 heterozygous carrier, and 28 affected RDEB, JEB, and EB-PA pregnancies were reported in these recessively inherited diseases. Two affected and four normal pregnancies were predicted in dominantly inherited EBS. Among the 144 pregnancies, 9 were terminated without confirmation, 13 cases were lost to follow-up, and 6 pregnancies are ongoing. There were 6 families with inconclusive results due either to recombination events between flanking markers, absence of informative markers for one allele, or lack of sample from the previously affected child. There were three discordant results, one that was explained by maternal contamination of the chorionic villus sample and two that were unresolved. Overall, the availability, relative ease, and over 98% success rate make molecular DNA-based prenatal diagnosis a viable option for EB families at risk.",

        "Abstract": "Cell adhesion and communication are interdependent aspects of cell behavior that are critical for morphogenesis and tissue architecture. In the skin, epidermal adhesion is mediated in part by specialized cell-cell junctions known as desmosomes, which are characterized by the presence of desmosomal cadherins, known as desmogleins and desmocollins. We identified a cadherin family member, desmoglein 4, which is expressed in the suprabasal epidermis and hair follicle. The essential role of desmoglein 4 in skin was established by identifying mutations in families with inherited hypotrichosis, as well as in the lanceolate hair mouse. We also show that DSG4 is an autoantigen in pemphigus vulgaris. Characterization of the phenotype of naturally occurring mutant mice revealed disruption of desmosomal adhesion and perturbations in keratinocyte behavior. We provide evidence that desmoglein 4 is a key mediator of keratinocyte cell adhesion in the hair follicle, where it coordinates the transition from proliferation to differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "We studied a single patient with the lethal (Herlitz) type of junctional epidermolysis bullosa (H-JEB). Screening for mutations in the LAMB3 gene in the patient revealed the previously described hotspot mutation R635X and a novel one basepair deletion in exon 10. The single basepair deletion 1094delA could be detected in the clinically unaffected mother, while the nonsense mutation R635X could not be found in the peripheral blood DNA of either parent. After excluding non-paternity by microsatellite analysis using random markers on chromosomes 3, 8 and 18, we determined that the mutation R635X in the proband was most likely the result of a de novo event or alternatively, germline mosaicism. The parents requested prenatal diagnosis for a second pregnancy, and while the maternal mutation 1094delA could not be detected in DNA from the fetus, unexpectedly, the mutation R635X was present in the chorionic villus DNA. These findings were most consistent with paternal germline mosaicism for the recessive mutation R635X. The results have had a significant impact on the genetic counseling in this family. To our knowledge, this study represents the first documented case of germline mosaicism in junctional epidermolysis bullosa, and serves as a reminder that germline mosaicism should be considered in cases in which a 'new' mutation is found in the offspring of a clinically and/or genetically unaffected parent.",

However, currently available techniques are labor-intensive and time-consuming, and thus the diagnosis is delayed, making the mother's decision difficult. We describe a rapid, high-throughput technique based on the ligation assay coupled with automated capillary fluorescence detection. This new approach allows the diagnosis of both Hgb S and Hgb C to be available in a few hours. We have utilized this technique in 30 prenatal diagnoses and found it to be in complete agreement with the standard diagnoses.",

        "Abstract": "The sonic hedgehog (SHH)-patched (PTCH) pathway functions in normal embryonic development of the brain, musculoskeletal system, and hair follicles, and in normal post-natal control of hair follicles. Dysregulation of the pathway has been implicated in a variety of neoplasias, including those of skin and brain. Based on the knowledge that generalized, prolonged PTCH expression can inhibit the effects of SHH signaling, we tested the hypothesis that localized transient overexpression of PTCH would inhibit the phenotype of SHH-induced accelerated growth of hair follicles. Adenovirus (Ad)-mediated transient over-expression of Shh (AdShh) in telogen (8 weeks) mouse skin induced anagen hair growth as demonstrated by histology and gross appearance. Strikingly, local intradermal administration of a Ptch-expressing adenovirus (AdPtch), but not a Null control adenovirus (AdNull), 18 hours before AdShh injection, significantly blocked this phenotype, with 100% of AdPtch+AdShh mice failing to advance to anagen compared with AdNull+AdShh mice and AdShh mice (30% and 45% failing to advance to anagen, respectively). Thus, PTCH expression mediated by gene transfer can modulate the SHH signaling pathway in the adult mammal and may serve as a starting point for therapies relevant to clinical conditions resulting from dysregulation of this pathway as well as for strategies to suppress normal SHH-dependent processes, such as hair growth.",

Published estimates of the prevalence of this disorder remain surprisingly low considering pathogenetic mutations in hr have been found in distinct populations around the world. Therefore, it is likely that congenital atrichia with papular lesions is more common than previously thought and is often mistaken for the putative autoimmune form of alopecia universalis. To clarify this discrepancy, we propose criteria for the clinical diagnosis of congenital atrichia with papular lesions. Among these is the novel report of the consistent observation of hypopigmented whitish streaks on the scalp surface of affected individuals. Additionally, we report the identification of a novel missense mutation in hr from a family of Arab Palestinian origin that exhibits the pathognomonic features of atrichia with papular lesions. Collectively, we anticipate that an increased recognition of this disorder will result in more accurate diagnosis and the sparing of unnecessarily treatment to patients.",

        "Abstract": "Atrichia with papular lesions is a rare form of total alopecia, in which mutations in the hairless gene have been shown to underlie the phenotype. In the literature to date, atrichia with papular lesions has generally been reported to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. A few rare cases exist, however, in which parent-to-child transmission of atrichia with papular lesions has been documented. In this study, further investigations were carried out into the molecular basis of atrichia with papular lesions in a family with mother-to-son transmission by searching for mutations in the human hairless gene. Specific ally, we wanted to determine whether this case truly represented an example of dominantly inherited atrichia with papular lesions, or whether another mode of inheritance might be responsible for the disorder in this kindred. Pseudodominant inheritance, for example, occurs when an individual with a known recessive disorder has a clinically unaffected partner, but then unexpectedly gives birth to children who are affected with the same recessive disorder as the affected parent, and can easily be distinguished from classical dominant inheritance with molecular diagnosis and haplotype analysis. In the family reported here, we have determined that both the mother and son are, in fact, homozygous for a novel mutation in the hairless gene, R33X. We provide the first evidence for pseudodominant inheritance in atrichia with papular lesions, and at the same time extend our knowledge of pathogenetic mutations in the human hairless gene. Importantly, this information allows revisions in genetic counseling for risk of transmission for individuals in the family, previously impossible in the absence of knowing the genetic basis of atrichia with papular lesions in this unusual kindred.",

        "Abstract": "Cutaneous leiomyomas, rare benign tumors originating from the arrector pili muscle of the hair follicle, can be associated with the common uterine fibroids in a syndrome called multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas. Multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, providing an excellent opportunity for the study of the common non-Mendelian manifestation of isolated uterine fibroids. This study reports the clinical and molecular characterization of an extended family with multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas. Linkage analysis has shown that the disease in this family is linked to the recently reported genetic locus for multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas, with a maximum two-point LOD score of 4.453 for markers D1S2670, D1S2785, D1S547, and D1S1609. The identification of key recombination events has allowed us to refine substantially the location of the genetic locus for multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas, from 14 cM to an interval of 4.55 or 7.19 cM, depending on the final phenotype of a young family member in which one of the key recombination events has occurred. In addition, we provide a description of the interesting pattern and progression of the skin phenotype in this four-generation kindred. The refinement of the genetic locus for multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and the availability of an extended multigeneration pedigree will facilitate the identification of the mutated gene responsible for multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas, which, in turn, may provide key information for the understanding of the molecular basis of the common uterine fibroids.",

        "Abstract": "The constitutive desmosomal plaque protein desmoplakin plays a vital part in keratinocyte adhesion in linking the transmembranous desmosomal cadherins to the cytoplasmic keratin filament network. Recently, mutations in desmoplakin have been shown to underlie some cases of the autosomal dominant disorder, striate palmoplantar keratoderma, as well as an autosomal recessive condition characterized by dilated cardiomyopathy, woolly hair, and keratoderma. Here, we describe two unrelated individuals with a new autosomal recessive genodermatosis characterized by focal and diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma, hyperkeratotic plaques on the trunk and limbs, varying degrees of alopecia, but no apparent cardiac anomalies. Mutation screening of desmoplakin demonstrated compound heterozygosity for a non-sense/mis-sense combination of mutations in both cases, C809X/N287K and Q664X/R2366C, respectively. Heterozygous carriers of any of these mutations displayed no phenotypic abnormalities. Immunohistochemistry of skin biopsies from both affected individuals revealed that desmoplakin was not just located at the cell periphery but there was also cytoplasmic staining. In addition, electron microscopy demonstrated acantholysis throughout all layers of the skin, focal detachment of desmosomes into the intercellular spaces, and perinuclear condensation of the suprabasal keratin intermediate filament network. Clinicopathologic and mutational analyses therefore demonstrate that desmoplakin haploinsufficiency can be tolerated in some cases, but that in combination with a mis-sense mutation on the other allele, the consequences are a severe genodermatosis with specific clinical manifestations.",

        "Abstract": "Atrichia with papular lesions (APL) is a rare form of hair loss with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance that is characterized by the absence of normal hair follicles, and formation of intradermal cystic structures. Mutations in the hairless (hr) gene in mice and humans have been implicated in the development of this phenotype. Hairless is a putative transcription factor containing a single zinc-finger DNA binding domain, with restricted expression in brain and skin. Here, we describe the complete hr cDNA sequence from the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and report the identification of a compound heterozygous mutation in a hairless rhesus macaque born from unrelated parents. Cutaneous biopsy samples from the affected macaque revealed abnormalities, including the replacement of normal hair follicles with dermal cysts and comedones, reminiscent of the skin phenotype observed in hairless mice and humans with APL.",
