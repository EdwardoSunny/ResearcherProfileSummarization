        "Abstract": "The 21st Century Cures Act mandates sharing electronic health records (EHRs) with patients. Health care providers must ensure confidential sharing of medical information with adolescents while maintaining parental insight into adolescent health. Given variability in state laws, provider opinions, EHR systems, and technological limitations, consensus on best practices to achieve adolescent clinical note sharing at scale is needed.",

However, limited time during clinical encounters is one barrier to routine breast cancer risk assessment. We evaluated if electronic health record (EHR) data downloaded using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is sufficient for breast cancer risk calculation in our decision support tools, RealRisks and BNAV. We accessed EHR data using FHIR for six patient advocates, and downloaded and parsed XML documents. We searched for relevant clinical variables, and evaluated if data was sufficient to calculate risk using validated models (Gail, Breast Cancer Screening Consortium [BCSC], BRCAPRO). While only one advocate had sufficient EHR data to calculate risk using the BCSC model only, we identified variables including age, race/ethnicity, mammographic density, and prior breast biopsy in most advocates. EHR data from FHIR could be incorporated into automated breast cancer risk calculation in clinical decision support tools.",

        "Abstract": "When the terminology services at our institution encountered the installation of a new multi-site laboratory information system (LIS), we pursued obtaining a regular dictionary feed to keep the central terminology up-to-date. What we didn't predict was the value added to the LIS implementation effort by a cooperative vocabulary strategy. In this report, we describe how preexisting terminology services were leveraged to facilitate the integration of 2 previously independent laboratories into a new cross-campus LIS.",
