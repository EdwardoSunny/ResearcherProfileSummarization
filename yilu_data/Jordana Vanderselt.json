        "Abstract": "Goats were domesticated in the Fertile Crescent about 10,000\u00a0years before present (YBP) and subsequently spread across Eurasia and Africa. This dispersal is expected to generate a gradient of declining genetic diversity with increasing distance from the areas of early livestock management. Previous studies have reported the existence of such genetic cline in European goat populations, but they were based on a limited number of microsatellite markers. Here, we have analyzed data generated by the AdaptMap project and other studies. More specifically, we have used the geographic coordinates and estimates of the observed (H",

        "Abstract": "Anti-cancer immunotherapies entirely changed the therapeutic approach to oncological patients. However, despite the undeniable success of anti-PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 antibody treatments, their effectiveness is limited either by certain types of malignancies or by the arising problem of cancer resistance. B7H4 (aliases B7x, B7H4, B7S1, VTCN1) is a member of a B7 immune checkpoint family with a distinct expression pattern from classical immune checkpoint pathways. The growing amount of research results seem to support the thesis that B7H4 might be a very potent therapeutic target. B7H4 was demonstrated to promote tumour progression in immune \"cold\" tumours by promoting migration, proliferation of tumour cells, and cancer stem cell persistence. B7H4 suppresses T cell effector functions, including inflammatory cytokine production, cytolytic activity, proliferation of T cells, and promoting the polarisation of na\u00efve CD4 T cells into induced Tregs. This review aimed to summarise the available information about B7H4, focusing in particular on clinical implications, immunological mechanisms, potential strategies for malignancy treatment, and ongoing clinical trials.",

        "Abstract": "May Measurement Month 2021 (MMM21) is the fourth edition of the global initiative in Poland initiated by the International Society of Hypertension (ISH) and aimed at raising awareness of hypertension and the need for blood pressure (BP) screening. An opportunistic cross-sectional survey of volunteers aged \u226518 was carried out in 132 sites - between May and September 2021. Blood pressure was measured in 1699 subjects (mean age: 40.8 \u00b1 17.0 years; 68.8% females). After multiple imputation, the age and sex standardized systolic and diastolic BP was 126.6/78.7 mmHg for the entire group, 133.8/81.9 mmHg in individuals on antihypertensive medication, and 125.4/78.6 mmHg in those not taking antihypertensive drugs. The proportion of subjects with high BP (\u2265140/90 mmHg) were: 30.9% for the entire group, 40.4% in subjects taking antihypertensive drugs, and 17.9% in those not taking antihypertensive drugs. Of all participants, 33.9% were in the age range of 18-29 years and we observed higher BP levels and more frequent BP elevation in males in this age group. These data provide unique insights into the hypertension rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the associated restrictions, only limited data could be obtained for older adults. Interestingly, among young Polish participants, the rate of hypertension and the level of BP were higher in males compared to females, suggestive perhaps of a higher susceptibility of males to experience a rise in BP during specific circumstances associated with a pandemic.",

        "Abstract": "The optic nerve is frequently involved in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, MRI of the optic nerve is considered optional in the differential diagnosis of optic neuropathy symptoms either at presentation or in established MS. In addition, unlike spinal cord imaging in comparable scenarios, no role is currently recommended for optic nerve MRI in patients presenting with optic neuritis for its confirmation, to plan therapeutic strategy, within the MS diagnostic framework, nor for the detection of subclinical activity in established MS. In this article, evidence related to these 3 aspects will be summarized and gaps in knowledge will be highlighted, including (1) the acquisition challenges and novel sequences that assess pathologic changes within the anterior visual pathways; (2) the clinical implications of quantitative magnetic resonance studies of the optic nerve, focusing on atrophy measures, magnetization transfer, and diffusion tensor imaging; and (3) the relevant clinical studies performed to date. Finally, an algorithm for the application of optic nerve MRI will be proposed to guide future studies aimed at addressing our knowledge gaps.",

        "Title": "Assessment of Concentration KRT6 Proteins in Tumor and Matching Surgical Margin from Patients with Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.",
        "Abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are one of the most frequently detected cancers in the world; not all mechanisms related to the expression of keratin in this type of cancer are known. The aim of this study was to evaluate type II cytokeratins (KRT): KRT6A, KRT6B, and KRT6C protein concentrations in 54 tumor and margin samples of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Moreover, we examined a possible association between protein concentration and the clinical and demographic variables. Protein concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Significantly higher KRT6A protein concentration was found in HNSCC samples compared to surgical margins. An inverse relationship was observed for KRT6B and KRT6C proteins. We showed an association between the KRT6C protein level and clinical parameters T and N in tumor and margin samples. When analyzing the effect of smoking and drinking on KRT6A, KRT6B, and KRT6C levels, we demonstrated a statistically significant difference between regular or occasional tobacco and alcohol habits and patients who do not have any tobacco and alcohol habits in tumor and margin samples. Moreover, we found an association between KRT6B and KRT6C concentration and proliferative index Ki-67 and HPV status in tumor samples. Our results showed that concentrations of KRT6s were different in the tumor and the margin samples and varied in relation to clinical and demographic parameters. We add information to the current knowledge about the role of KRT6s isoforms in HNSCC. We speculate that variations in the studied isoforms of the KRT6 protein could be due to the presence and development of the tumor and its microenvironment. It is important to note that the analyses were performed in tumor and surgical margins and can provide more accurate information on the function in normal and cancer cells and regulation in response to various factors.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess potential health risks among children and adolescents consuming various grilled marshmallows using a survey and to determine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in these food products. PAH analysis in grilled marshmallows included a dilution stage with deionized water and liquid-liquid extraction with cyclohexane and solid-phase extraction (SPE). PAH fractions were initially analyzed via high-performance thin-layer chromatography, and PAH concentrations were determined via gas chromatography with a tandem mass detector using the selective reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. This study on the consumption of grilled marshmallows was conducted among approximately 300 children and adolescents. The preliminary results indicated that \"raw\" marshmallows did not contain PAHs. However, the obtained data suggested the exposure of young people to carcinogenic PAHs from grilled marshmallows (63.5% of them consumed marshmallows). Carcinogenic benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) was determined in all samples. The profile of PAH concentrations in the extracts isolated from various grilled types of marshmallows was similar (r",

Nevertheless, over 40% of B cell malignancy patients experience a relapse after CAR-T therapy, likely due to inadequate persistence of the modified T cells in the body. IL15, known for its pro-survival and proliferative properties, has been suggested for incorporation into the fourth generation of CAR-T cells to enhance their persistence. However, the potential systemic toxicity associated with this cytokine warrants further evaluation.",

        "Title": "Adipose Dysfunction Indices as a Key to Cardiometabolic Risk Assessment-A Population-Based Study of Post-Myocardial Infarction Patients.",
        "Abstract": "Anthropometric indices, such as the BMI (body mass index), WC (waist circumference), and WHR (waist-hip ratio) are commonly used for cardiometabolic risk assessment. Consequently, in the context of evaluating cardiometabolic risk in the post-MI population, it is worthwhile to consider indices such as the Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) and Body Adiposity Index (BAI), which have emerged as valuable risk assessment tools in clinical trials. The aim of this study was to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the importance of anthropometric indices and body composition analysis in evaluating the cardiometabolic risk among post-myocardial infarction patients. In the pursuit of this objective, this study involved assessing the BMI, WC, WHR, WHtR, VAI, BAI, and body composition in a population of patients. This study enrolled a total of 120 patients hospitalised at the Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases (SCCS) due to MI, and body composition analysis evaluated various parameters including the percentage of adipose tissue (FatP) [%], total adipose tissue (FatM) [kg], fat-free mass (FFM) [kg], muscle mass (PMM) [kg], total body water (TBW) [kg], and visceral adipose tissue (VFAT). The mean BMI for the entire group was 27.76 \u00b1 4.08, with women exhibiting a significantly lower value compared with men (26.66 \u00b1 3.33 vs. 28.16 \u00b1 4.27). The mean values obtained for the WHR, WHtR, BAI, and VAI were 0.97 \u00b1 0.08, 0.59 \u00b1 0.07, 28.37 \u00b1 5.03, and 3.08 \u00b1 3.50, respectively. Based on the visceral adiposity index (VAI), in 47.5% patients, there was no adipose tissue dysfunction, with a higher proportion among women (71.88%) compared with men (38.64%). What raises concern is that 32.50% of patients had acute ATD, with a significantly higher prevalence among men (38.64%) compared with women (15.63%). Conclusion: The study results suggest that the BMI, WC, and WHR have their limitations, whereas the WHtR, VAI, and BAI provide a more comprehensive view of cardiometabolic risk, especially in the context of adipose tissue distribution and its metabolic consequences. Incorporating the WHtR, VAI, and BAI into routine clinical practice may enhance the management of cardiometabolic risk, especially among post-MI patients.",

        "Abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases accompanying metabolic syndrome comprise one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The medical community undertakes attempts to improve treatment options and minimize cardiovascular diseases' numerous consequences and exacerbations. In parallel with pharmacotherapies provided by physicians, nutritionists are developing strategies for diet therapy and prevention based on lifestyle changes, with high success rates. Consumption of specified food compounds included in various products with proven protective properties can be helpful in this regard. Due to the wide possibilities of diet in metabolic health promotion, it seems necessary to systematize information about the metabolically protective and cardioprotective properties of fiber, probiotic bacteria, plant sterols, folic acid, vitamins B12, C, and E, PUFAs, lycopene, polyphenols, arginine, CoQ10, and allicin. The aim of this review was to present the food compounds with potential use in cardiometabolic prevention and diet therapy based on the latest available literature.",

        "Abstract": "Subretinal injection (SI) is a novel drug delivery method, directly to retina for treatment of various eye disease. However, manual injection requires surgical experience and precision due to physiological factors. Robots offer solution to this issue, by reducing hand tremor and increased accuracy. This systematic review analyzes current status on robot-assisted SI compared to conventional techniques. Systematic search across 5 databases was conducted to identify studies comparing manual and robot-assisted SI procedures. Extracted data included robotic systems, complications, and success rates. Four studies, including one human trial, two ex vivo porcine eye studies, and one artificial eye model study were included in the synthesis. The findings show early advantages of robot-assisted SI. Compared to traditional interventions, robot procedures result in reduced tremor, what potentially lowers the risk of complications, including retinal tears and reflux. The first in-human randomized trial showed encouraging results, with no significant differences in surgical times or complications between robot-assisted and manual SI. However, major limitation of robot-assisted procedures is longer procedure time. Robot-assisted SI holds promise by offering increased precision and stability, reducing human error and potentially improving clinical outcomes. Challenges include cost, availability, and learning curve. Overall, early stage of robot-assisted SI suggests advantages in precision, complication reduction, and potentially improved drug delivery. Further research in human randomized trials is needed to fully assess its full-scale clinical application.",

New methodological approaches are emerging based on the hypothesis that chronic conditions are non-randomly associated forming multimorbidity patterns. However, there are few longitudinal studies of these patterns, which could allow for better preventive strategies and healthcare planning. The objective of the MTOP (Multimorbidity Trajectories in Older Patients) study is to identify patterns of chronic multimorbidity in a cohort of older patients and their progression and trajectories in the previous 10 years.",

        "Abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy is a rapidly developing field of medicine that aims to use the host's immune mechanisms to inhibit and eliminate cancer cells. Antibodies targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, and its ligand PD-L1 are used in various cancer therapies. However, the most thoroughly researched pathway targeting PD-1/PD-L1 has many limitations, and multiple malignancies resist its effects. Human endogenous retrovirus-H Long repeat-associating 2 (HHLA2, known as B7H5/B7H7/B7y) is the youngest known molecule from the B7 family. HHLA2/TMIGD2/KIRD3DL3 is one of the critical pathways in modulating the immune response. Recent studies have demonstrated that HHLA2 has a double effect in modulating the immune system. The connection of HHLA2 with TMIGD2 induces T cell growth and cytokine production via an AKT-dependent signaling cascade. On the other hand, the binding of HHLA2 and KIR3DL3 leads to the inhibition of T cells and mediates tumor resistance against NK cells. This review aimed to summarize novel information about HHLA2, focusing on immunological mechanisms and clinical features of the HHLA2/KIR3DL3/TMIGD2 pathway in the context of potential strategies for malignancy treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Nutrition periodization in football training is an important determinant of adaptation to cyclic training loads. Personalizing an athlete's diet is crucial to ensure optimal performance and body composition, depending on the phase of training. The purpose of this review is to answer the question of how the body composition of football players changes over the training macrocycle and how dietary recommendations should be tailored to specific training periods. The review of scientific evidence was conducted based on the available literature, typing in phrases related to training and nutrition periodization using the PubMed and Google Scholar database methodology tools. A literature search resulted in the selection of 346 sources directly related to the topic of the study, and then those with the highest scientific value were selected. There is a need to adjust energy and nutrient intake according to the different training phases in a football player's preparation cycle. During the preparatory phase, it is recommended to increase protein and energy intake to support anabolic processes and muscle mass development. During the competitive period, due to the intensity of matches and training, the importance of carbohydrates for glycogen replenishment and recovery is emphasized. The transition phase requires the regulation of caloric intake to prevent adverse changes in body composition. Hydration has been identified as a key element in each phase of training. Cooperation between coaches, nutritionists, and players is essential to optimize sports performance and rapid recovery, and the authors recommend continuous adaptation and nutritional optimization as an integral part of football training.",

        "Abstract": "The burden of cardiovascular disease and the percentage of frail patients in the aging population will increase. This study aims to assess the circulating levels of several cytokines in frail patients. This is an ancillary analysis of the FRAPICA trial. The ratio of men/women changed from robust through frail groups from 3:1 to 1:2. The groups are comparable in terms of age and body measurements analysis (weight, height, and BMI), yet the frail patients have significantly reduced fat-free mass, and more often have been diagnosed with diabetes. Frail patients have higher fibroblast growth factor basic (FGF basic) and follistatin levels (borderline significance). In multiple linear regression modeling of fat-free mass, we identified FGF basic, osteopontin, stem cell factor, soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2, soluble epidermal growth factor receptor, soluble human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, follistatin, prolactin, soluble interleukin 6 receptor alfa, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, soluble vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor 1, leptin, soluble angiopoietin/tyrosine kinase 2, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. We have identified a few cytokines that correlate with fat-free mass, a hallmark of frailty. They comprise the kinins implicated in bone and muscle metabolism, fibrosis, vascular wall function, inflammation, endocrine function, or regulation of bone marrow integrity.",

        "Abstract": "The restoration of blood flow to the ischemic myocardium inflicts ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) heart injury (IRI). The main contributors to IRI are increased oxidative stress and subsequent excessive production of ROS, increased expression of NOS and peroxinitate, activation of MMPs, and enhanced posttranslational modifications of contractile proteins, which make them more susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Since the pathophysiology of IRI is a complex issue, and thus, various therapeutic strategies are required to prevent or reduce IRI and microvascular dysfunction, in the current study we proposed an innovative multi-drug therapy using low concentrations of drugs applied intracoronary to reach microvessels in order to stabilize the pro- and antioxidant balance during a MI in an in vivo pig model. The ability of a mixture of doxycycline (1 \u03bcM), ML-7 (0.5 \u03bcM), and L-NAME (2 \u03bcM) to modulate the pro- and antioxidative balance was tested in the left ventricle tissue and blood samples. Data showed that infusion of a MIX reduced the total oxidative status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI), and malondialdehyde (MDA). It also increased the total antioxidant capacity, confirming its antioxidative properties. MIX administration also reduced the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and then decreased the release of MLC1 and BNP-26 into plasma. This study demonstrated that intracoronary administration of low concentrations of doxycycline in combination with ML-7 and L-NAME is incredibly efficient in regulating pro- and antioxidant balance during MI.",

        "Abstract": "The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified the consumption of heat-processed meat as a direct human carcinogen and the consumption of red meat as a probable carcinogen. Mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds present in meat dishes include, among others, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs). These compounds can cause the development of gastrointestinal cancer. Oral cancer is one of the world's research priorities due to the ever-increasing incidence rate. However, the effect of diet on oral cancer is still a poorly recognized issue. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the risk of oral cancer and dietary ingredients with a particular emphasis on red meat and thermally processed meat. This study was conducted among patients with oral cancer in 2022 and 2023. The shortened standardized Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and a multivariate regression statistical analysis were used. The high consumption of red meat in general and thermally processed meat, especially smoked, fried, roasted and boiled, increases the risk of oral cavity cancer. Limiting the consumption of meat products and modifying the methods of preparing meat dishes may reduce exposure to carcinogenic compounds from the diet and thus reduce the risk of developing oral cancer.",

        "Abstract": "This paper describes the effects of murine norovirus (MNV) infection on oxidative stress and histopathological changes in mice. This study uses histopathological assays, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant markers, and total oxidative status and capacity (TOS, TAC). The results suggest that MNV infection can lead to significant changes with respect to the above-mentioned parameters in various organs. Specifically, reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD), Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were observed in liver tissues, while higher MnSOD activity was observed in kidney tissues of MNV-infected mice when compared to the control. GR activity was lower in all tissues of MNV-infected mice tested, with the exception of lung tissue. This study also showed that norovirus infection led to increased TOS levels in the brain and liver and TAC levels in the brain, while TOS levels were significantly reduced in the kidneys. These changes may be due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by the viral infection. ROS can damage cells and contribute to oxidative stress. These studies help us to understand the pathogenesis of MNV infection and its potential effects on oxidative stress and histopathological changes in mice, and pave the way for further studies of the long-term effects of MNV infection.",

        "Abstract": "Cerebral aneurysm is a life-threatening condition, which requires high precision during the neurosurgical procedures. Increasing progress of evaluating modern devices in medicine have led to common usage of robotic systems in many fields, including cranial aneurysm operations. However, currently no systematic review describes up-to date knowledge of this topic. Following PRISMA guidelines, we have independently screened and extracted works from seven databases. Only studies fulfilling inclusion criteria were presented in this study. Device used, operation time, complications, aneurysm type and patient demographics were extracted from each work. We identified a total of 995 articles from databases. We have found six original works and one supplementary article eligible for this synthesis. Majority of works (4/6) have implemented CorPath GRX in cerebral aneurysm procedures. The procedures involved diverse aneurysm locations, utilizing flow diverters, stents, or coiling. One study described implementation of robot-assist on 117 patients and compared results to randomized clinical trials. One work with a small patient cohort described use of the magnetically-controlled microguidewire in the coiling procedures, without any complications. Additionally, one case-series study described use of a robotic arm for managing intraoperative aneurysm rupture. Currently, robotical devices for cerebral aneurysm treatment mainly lack jailing and haptic feedback feature. Further development of these devices will certainly be beneficial for operators and patients, allowing for more precise and remote surgeries.",

        "Abstract": "Injuries to the articular cartilage of the human knee joint, commonly resulting from trauma, inflammation, or age- and activity-related wear and tear, have significant implications, primarily leading to osteoarthritis (OA). Conservative treatments for such injuries often yield suboptimal clinical outcomes. Surgical interventions using current methods may not consistently provide satisfactory results, largely due to the formation of low-quality scar tissue lacking the biomechanical properties of hyaline cartilage. In this retrospective study, we compared the results of two promising methods for regenerating cartilage defects in the knee joints using scaffolds soaked with stem cells of different origins: bone marrow aspirate concentrate mesenchymal stem cells (BMAC-MSCs) and human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs). We evaluated 39 patients (39 knees, hUCB-MSCs: 20 knees, BMAC: 19 knees) at the 12-month follow-up using VAS, KOOS, Lysholm scales and radiologically with M-MOCART 2.0 score. The analysis demonstrated substantial overall improvement in both groups, notably reflected in enhanced quality of life for the patients. Interestingly, the final scores in the hUCB-MSCs group were comparable to those in the BMAC-MSCs group, with no statistically significant differences observed, despite variations in preoperative age and lesion size. Notably, the hUCB-MSCs group consisted of significantly older individuals with larger lesion sizes. Both procedures were found to be safe, and improvement was observed in both groups, which holds promise for future clinical investigations.",

        "Abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive DNA that can create genome structure and regulation variability. The genome of Rhizophagus irregularis, a widely studied arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), comprises \u223c50% repetitive sequences that include TEs. Despite their abundance, two-thirds of TEs remain unclassified, and their regulation among AMF life stages remains unknown. Here, we aimed to improve our understanding of TE diversity and regulation in this model species by curating repeat datasets obtained from chromosome-level assemblies and by investigating their expression across multiple conditions. Our analyses uncovered new TE superfamilies and families in this model symbiont and revealed significant differences in how these sequences evolve both within and between R. irregularis strains. With this curated TE annotation, we also found that the number of upregulated TE families in colonized roots is 4 times higher than in the extraradical mycelium, and their overall expression differs depending on the plant host. This work provides a fine-scale view of TE diversity and evolution in model plant symbionts and highlights their transcriptional dynamism and specificity during host-microbe interactions. We also provide Hidden Markov Model profiles of TE domains for future manual curation of uncharacterized sequences (https://github.com/jordana-olive/TE-manual-curation/tree/main).",

        "Abstract": "The inflammatory process is triggered by several factors such as toxins, pathogens, and damaged cells, promoting inflammation in various systems, including the cardiovascular system, leading to heart failure. The link between periodontitis as a chronic inflammatory disease and cardiovascular disease is confirmed. Propolis and its major component, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), exhibit protective mechanisms and anti-inflammatory effects on the cardiovascular system. The objective of the conducted study was to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of the Polish ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) and its major component-CAPE-in interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS + IFN-\u03b1-induced human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1). EEP and CAPE were used at 10-100 \u00b5g/mL. A multiplex assay was used for interleukin and adhesive molecule detection. Our results demonstrate that EEP, at a concentration of 25 \u00b5g/mL, decreases pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in LPS-induced HGF-1. At the same concentration, EEP increases the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in LPS + IFN-\u03b1-induced HGF-1. In the case of CAPE, IL-6 in LPS and LPS + IFN-\u03b1 induced HGF-1 was decreased in all concentrations. However, in the case of IL-10, CAPE causes the highest increase at 50 \u00b5g/mL in IFN-\u03b1 induced HGF-1. Regarding the impact of EEP on adhesion molecules, there was a noticeable reduction of E-selectin by EEP at 25, 50, and100 \u00b5g/mL in IFN-\u03b1 -induced HGF-1. In a range of 10-100 \u00b5g/mL, EEP decreased endothelin-1 (ET-1) during all stimulations. CAPE statistically significantly decreases the level of ET-1 at 25-100 \u00b5g/mL in IFN-\u03b1 and LPS + IFN-\u03b1. In the case of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), EEP and CAPE downregulated its expression in a non-statistically significant manner. Based on the obtained results, EEP and CAPE may generate beneficial cardiovascular effects by influencing selected factors. EEP and CAPE exert an impact on cytokines in a dose-dependent manner.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to compare the concentration of various xenobiotics in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. We examined 175 autopsy cases covering a wide range of ages, causes of death, and drug ingestion histories, with cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples available for toxicological testing. Analytes studied included opioids, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and illicit substances such as cannabinoids, stimulants and new psychoactive substances, including synthetic cathinones and synthetic cannabinoids. We found that concentrations in CSF were generally lower than in blood. A significant correlation was observed between drug concentrations in CSF and blood for many analytes (p\u2009<\u20090.05). However, the strength and direction of the correlation varied considerably depending on the physicochemical properties of the drugs, suggesting that a 'one size fits all' model may not be applicable. The results indicate that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be used to detect a variety of xenobiotics, particularly amphetamines, synthetic cathinones and synthetic cannabinoids, in cases where conventional biological materials are not available. Additionally, using the results obtained in the future can lead to a better understanding of pharmacokinetic processes and the effect of post-mortem redistribution. Further research is needed to refine our understanding of these relationships.",

The use of remote endpoints could allow more diverse participation in clinical trials while minimizing participant burden but must be robustly evaluated to ensure adequate performance and feasibility. In response, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation convened the Remote Endpoint Task Force (Supplemental Table 1), a multidisciplinary group of CF researchers with remote endpoint expertise and community members tasked to better understand the current and future use of remote endpoints for clinical research. Here, we describe the current use of remote endpoints in CF clinical research, address key unanswered questions regarding their use and feasibility, and discuss the next steps to determine clinical trial readiness.",

        "Title": "Comparison of Nutrition among Female Floorball Players of Extra-Class Teams from Poland and the Czech Republic during the Preparation Period for the League Season.",
        "Abstract": "The study aimed to assess the frequency of food intake and to compare the consumption of female extramural players training floorball in Poland and the Czech Republic during the preparation period for the league season. In total, 43 players training floorball in senior clubs participated in the study, including 21 from the Polish and 22 from the Czech clubs. The research tool was based on the standardised questionnaire for the Examination of Eating Behaviours and Opinions on Food and Nutrition (QEB). The study also analysed body composition using the Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) method, and the research tool was a TANITA MC-780 S MA body composition analyser (Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The Polish women's floorball players had lower results in body fat percentage (FM) and muscle mass (MM) than the Czech team. The mean FM in the players of the Polish team was 18.6% \u00b1 5.4, and the mean MM was 45.8 kg \u00b1 4.2. In the Czech team players, these figures were 19.8% \u00b1 5.4 and 47.8 kg \u00b1 4.2. Despite the similar value of mean BMI in both teams, the highest BMI in the case of female athletes from Poland (17.7), indicating underweight, and the highest BMI in female athletes from the Czech Republic (26.9), indicating overweight, were significant. The study showed differences in both body composition analysis and dietary patterns of the Czech and Polish players. The Czech women's floorball players had a higher muscle mass and body fat percentage than Polish floorball players. Furthermore, differences in diet were observed among the players of the Czech team compared to the players of the Polish team. The Czech women's floorball players consumed a slightly higher amount of healthier products, such as whole-grain products. The Polish players took in more meat, processed products and fruit juices. This study is one of the first to assess the nutrition of those involved in floorball. There is a need for further research that focuses on the specifics of the discipline, the exercise capacity of the players and points during the season that require nutritional support. This knowledge would help develop effective nutritional strategies and plan and implement appropriate nutrition education for this group of athletes.",

        "Title": "Osteonal Damage Patterns from Ballistic and Blunt Force Trauma in Human Long Bones.",
        "Abstract": "Forensic anthropologists play a key role in skeletal trauma analysis and commonly use macroscopic features to distinguish between trauma types. However, this approach can be challenging, particularly in cases of highly comminuted or incompletely recovered fractures. Histological analysis of microscopic fracture characteristics in fractured bones may thus help provide additional information on trauma type and bone fracture biomechanics in general. This study analysed the extent of microcrack damage to osteons in long bones with blunt force trauma (BFT) and gunshot trauma (GST), from both traumatic death cases and post-mortem experimental fractures. We identified four types of osteonal damage (OD). In traumatic death cases, OD affecting the inside of the osteon and compromising the Haversian canal (type 1) was found to be indicative of BFT. Moreover, OD affecting the cement line (type 3) and interstitial lamellae (type 4) was more common in the GST samples. OD affecting the inside of the osteon without compromising the Haversian canal (type 2) was not found to be indicative of either trauma type. In cases of experimental fractures, our study revealed that post-mortem fractures in dry bone samples featured the highest amount of OD, particularly of type 4. This study also found that the experimentally produced GST featured similar OD patterns to GST death cases. These findings support our hypothesis that there are distinct osteonal damage patterns in human long bones with BFT and GST, which are of relevant value for trauma analysis in forensic anthropology.",

        "Abstract": "Human adenovirus 36 (HAdV-D36) is presently the sole virus identified to be associated with an elevated risk of obesity in both humans and animals. However, its impact on embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) remains unexplored. This study endeavoured to examine the influence of HAdV-D36 on embryonic development by utilizing embryonated chicken eggs as a dynamic model. To simulate various infection routes, the allantoic cavity and the yolk sac of ECEs were inoculated with HAdV-D36. Subsequently, embryos from both the experimental (inoculated with virus) and control (inoculated with PBS) groups were weighed and subjected to daily histological examination. The daily embryo weights were assessed and compared between groups using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Histopathological changes in tissues were examined and compared between the tested and control groups to ascertain physiological alterations induced by the virus. Our study confirmed a significant increase in the body weight of ECEs. However, this phenomenon was not attributable to adipose tissue development; rather, it was characterized by an augmented number of cells in all observed tissues compared to control subjects. We posit that HAdV-D36 may impact developing organisms through mechanisms other than enhanced adipose tissue development. Specifically, our findings indicate an increased number of cells in all tissues, a phenomenon that occurs through an as-yet-unexplored pathway.",

        "Abstract": "When dealing with badly preserved cadavers or skeletal human remains, the assessment of death circumstances remains challenging. When forensic evidence cannot be taken from the skin and soft tissue, the information may only be deduced from more resistant elements such as bone. Compared to cranial gunshot injuries, reliable data on ballistic long bone trauma remains scarce. This study aims to define ballistic fracture characteristics in human long bones. The shaft of 16 femurs and 13 humeri from body donors was perpendicularly shot with a 9-mm Luger full metal jacket bullet at an impact velocity of 360\u00a0m/s from a distance of 2\u00a0m. Some bones were embedded in Clear Ballistics Gel\u00ae, and some were shot without soft tissue simulant in order to better visualise the fracture propagation on the high-speed camera. The fractures were examined macroscopically and compared between the sample groups. We consistently found comminuted fractures with a stellate pattern. Fracture details were classified into entrance, exit and general characteristics. For some traits, we detected different occurrence values in the group comparison. The results indicate that some of the traits depend on bone properties such as shaft diameter, bone length and cortical thickness. The presence of ballistic gel also influenced some fracture traits, emphasising the relevance of soft tissue simulant in osseous gunshot experiments. This study revealed new insights in the detailed fracture pattern of human long bones. These may serve as guidelines for the identification and reconstruction of gunshot trauma in human long bones.",

        "Abstract": "Maintaining a balanced redox state within cells is crucial for the sustenance of life. The process involves continuous cytosolic disulfide reduction reactions to restore oxidized proteins to their reduced thiol forms. There are two main cellular antioxidant pathways-the thioredoxin (Trx) and glutathione (GSH)/glutaredoxin (Grx) systems. In the GSH/Grx system, glutathione reductase (GR; GSR) catalyses the reduction of GSH disulfide (GSSG) to its sulfhydryl form (GSH), which can then further reduce oxidized Grxs. GR is an essential enzyme that helps in maintaining the supply of reduced glutathione-GSH, which is a significant reducing thiol found in most cells and known for its antioxidant properties. Therefore, it can have a significant impact on cancer development. To investigate this further, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of GR protein expression in colon adenocarcinoma samples collected from patients with primary colon adenocarcinoma (stage I and II) and patients with metastasis to regional lymph nodes (stage III). The results of our study revealed a significant relationship between the immunohistochemical expression of GR and tumour histological grade, depth of invasion, regional lymph node involvement, staging, and PCNA immunohistochemical expression. It was found that 95% of patients with stage I had low levels of GR expression, whereas 89% of patients with stage III had high levels of immunohistochemical expression. A high level of expression was also detected in the patients with stage II of the disease, where almost 63% were characterized by a high expression of GR. The Western blot method revealed that the highest level of expression was found in the LS 174T cell line, which corresponds to stage II. The results of our study indicate that the immunohistochemical expression of GR may act as an independent prognostic factor associated with colon adenocarcinoma patients' prognosis.",

        "Abstract": "Glutaredoxin 2 (Grx2; Glrx2) is a glutathione-dependent oxidoreductase located in mitochondria, which is central to the regulation of glutathione homeostasis and mitochondrial redox, and plays a crucial role in highly metabolic tissues. In response to mitochondrial redox signals and oxidative stress, Grx2 can catalyze the oxidation and S-glutathionylation of membrane-bound thiol proteins in mitochondria. Therefore, it can have a significant impact on cancer development. To investigate this further, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of Grx2 protein expression in colon adenocarcinoma samples collected from patients with primary colon adenocarcinoma (stage I and II) and patients with metastasis to regional lymph nodes (stage III). The results of our study revealed a significant relationship between the immunohistochemical expression of Grx2 and tumor histological grade, depth of invasion, regional lymph node involvement, angioinvasion, staging, and PCNA immunohistochemical expression. It was found that 87% of patients with stage I had high levels of Grx2 expression. In contrast, only 33% of patients with stage II and 1% of patients with stage III had high levels of Grx2 expression. Moreover, the multivariate analysis revealed that the immunohistochemical expression of Grx2 protein apart from the grade of tumor differentiation was an independent prognostic factors for the survival of patients with colon adenocarcinoma. Studies analyzing Grx2 levels in patients' blood confirmed that the highest levels of serum Grx2 protein was also found in stage I patients, which was reflected in the survival curves. A higher level of Grx2 in the serum has been associated with a more favorable outcome. These results were supported by in vitro analysis conducted on colorectal cancer cell lines that corresponded to stages I, II, and III of colorectal cancer, using qRT-PCR and Western Blot.",

        "Abstract": "Glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1) is an essential enzyme that regulates redox signal transduction and repairs protein oxidation by reversing S-glutathionylation, an oxidative modification of protein cysteine residues. Grx1 removes glutathione from proteins to restore their reduced state (protein-SH) and regulate protein-SSG levels in redox signaling networks. Thus, it can exert an influence on the development of cancer. To further investigate this problem, we performed an analysis of Grx1 expression in colon adenocarcinoma samples from the Polish population of patients with primary colon adenocarcinoma (stages I and II of colon cancer) and those with regional lymph node metastasis (stage III of colon cancer). Our study revealed a significant correlation between the expression of Grx1 protein through immunohistochemical analysis and various clinical characteristics of patients, such as histological grade, depth of invasion, angioinvasion, staging, regional lymph node invasion, and PCNA expression. It was found that almost 88% of patients with stage I had high levels of Grx1 expression, while only 1% of patients with stage III exhibited high levels of Grx1 protein expression. Furthermore, the study discovered that high levels of Grx1 expression were present in samples of colon mucosa without any pathological changes. These results were supported by in vitro analysis conducted on colorectal cancer cell lines that corresponded to stages I, II, and III of colorectal cancer, using qRT-PCR and Western blot.",

        "Abstract": "Proper nutrition during the first period of life is primarily related to meeting energy needs and providing essential nutrients that ensure the infant's normal physical and psychomotor development. Improper nutrition during this period, inadequate amounts of nutrients, inappropriate timing and manner of introduction of individual foods, can permanently alter metabolism and the course of physiological processes, increasing the risk of diseases such as obesity, allergic diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to verify how the method of complementary feeding influences the occurrence of food neophobia between 2 and 7 years of age, as well as to assess the different nutritional aspects resulting from the process of starting feeding other than breast milk and milk formula. In this study, 490 mothers and their children aged 2-7 years participated. The research tool was a questionnaire consisting of a child's dietary assessment and standardized questionnaires assessing food neophobia among children: Food Neophobia Scale for Children (FNSC) and the Montreal Children's Hospital-Pediatric Feeding (MCH-FS). In the study group of children, 238 (48.57%) had no Baby-Led Weaning Method (no BLW) method used during complementary feeding (CF), and 252 (51.42%) children used Baby-Led Weaning Method (BLW). According to the FNSC questionnaire, a high risk of food neophobia was found in 32.65% of the children studied and a medium risk in 39.80%. The medium risk of feeding problem occured in 11.63% of children, the high risk in 6.73% of children, and the highest risk in 6.94% (MCH-FS). No statistically significant differences were observed between the BLW and NoBLW groups. High risk of food neophobia occured in 1/3 of the children studied, but there was no relationship in the study group between the mode of CF (BLW/NoBLW) and the risk of food neophobia.",

        "Abstract": "B cells generate antibodies that provide protection from infection, but also cause pathology in autoimmune and allergic conditions. Antigen-specific B cells can be detected by binding their surface antibody receptors with native antigens conjugated to fluorescent probes, a technique that has revealed substantial insight into B cell activation and function. This protocol describes the process of generating fluorescent antigen tetramer probes and delineates a process of enriching large samples based on antigen-specificity for high-resolution analyses of the antigen-specific B cell repertoire. Enrichment of tetramer-binding cells allows for detection of antigen-specific B cells as rare as 1 in 100 million cells, providing sufficient resolution to study naive B cells and IgE-expressing cells by flow cytometry. The generation of antigen tetramers involves antigen biotinylation, assessment of biotin:antigen ratio for optimal tetramer loading and polymerization around a streptavidin-fluorophore backbone. We also describe the construction of a control tetramer to exclude B cells binding to the tetramer backbone. We provide a framework to validate whether tetramer probes are detecting true antigen-specific B cells and discuss considerations for experimental design. This protocol can be performed by researchers trained in basic biomedical/immunological research techniques, using instrumentation commonly found in most laboratories. Constructing the antigen and control tetramers takes 9 h, though their specificity should be assessed before experimentation and may take weeks to months depending on the method of validation. Sample enrichment requires ~2 h but is generally time and cost neutral as fewer cells are run through the flow cytometer.",

        "Abstract": "(1) Background: The aim of the study was to describe refractive development from early childhood to adulthood in Danish patients with albinism and to evaluate the effect of foveal developmental stage on refractive development; (2) Methods: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of ocular or oculocutaneous albinism were invited for a refractive evaluation and comprehensive phenotyping including macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans. Foveal hypoplasia was graded based on OCT from 0 (normal) to 4 (absence of any signs of foveal specialization). Medical files were reviewed for historical refractive values in individual patients; (3) Results: Hyperopia (spherical equivalent refraction (SEQ) of \u2265+1 Diopter (D)) was common in both children (81.3%) and adults (67.1%). The lower prevalence of hyperopia in adults was predominantly explained by increasing astigmatism with age. Emmetropization (>2D change from before 3 years to adolescence) was seen in 22.2%. There was no influence on foveal hypoplasia grade on the degree of refractive errors throughout life; (4) Conclusions: We found that emmetropization was uncommon in Danish patients with albinism and that the degree of foveal developmental stage did not influence emmetropization or the distribution of refractive errors. High degrees of hyperopia and astigmatism were common. These results indicate that fear of impeding emmetropization should not refrain the clinician from providing adequate correction for refractive errors in young children with albinism.",

This study aimed to assess the selected lifestyle factors and quality of life in the context of the development of NAFL (non-alcoholic fatty liver) in women diagnosed with hypothyroidism. This study included 134 women categorized into three groups: with hypothyroidism and NAFL, with only hypothyroidism, and with only NAFL. We compared the groups concerning the KomPAN and WHOQOL-BREF questionnaires, anthropometric measurements, body composition parameters, and the stage of liver steatosis. The individuals with NAFL most frequently consumed lard, fried dishes, processed meats, red meat, sweets, and sweetened beverages. The individuals with hypothyroidism without coexisting NAFL exhibited the highest satisfaction with health. The NAFL group had the highest average body fat percentage. Selected lifestyle aspects influenced the development of NAFL in women diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Women's overall quality of life did not vary depending on the coexisting medical conditions. Preventive programs should promote the following: the regular consumption of meals, the appropriate energy supply, physical activity, mental health support, and striving for proper body composition parameters.",

        "Abstract": "Milk yield and composition phenotypes are systematically recorded across several lactations in goats, but the majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed so far have rather ignored the longitudinal nature of such data. Here, we have used two different GWAS approaches to analyse data from three lactations recorded in Murciano-Granadina goats. In Analysis 1, independent GWAS have been carried out for each trait and lactation, while a single longitudinal GWAS, jointly considering all data, has been performed in Analysis 2. In both analyses, genome-wide significant QTL for lactose percentage on chromosome 2 (129.77-131.01\u2009Mb) and for milk protein percentage on the chromosome 6 (74.8-94.6\u2009Mb) casein gene cluster region were detected. In Analysis 1, several QTL were not replicated in all three lactations, possibly due to the existence of lactation-specific genetic determinants. In Analysis 2, we identified several genome-wide significant QTL related to milk yield and protein content that were not uncovered in Analysis 1. The increased number of QTL identified in Analysis 2 suggests that the longitudinal GWAS is particularly well suited for the genetic analysis of dairy traits. Moreover, our data confirm that variability within or close to the casein complex is the main genetic determinant of milk protein percentage in Murciano-Granadina goats.",

        "Title": "Trapping liquids may bias the results of beetle diversity assessment.",
        "Abstract": "Several different techniques and methods are used to capture and study beetles (Coleoptera). One option is the use of window traps with various trapping liquids. However, these liquids used in comparative studies may have a biasing effect on the results. The effectiveness of the frequently used liquid baits, involving beer, wine, vinegar, and water as the reference liquid, was compared in this study. Twenty-four traps were assigned to two habitat categories (sunny and shady) and four kinds of bait: beer, wine, vinegar, and water. During the study from June to July 2021, a total of 29,944 invertebrates were captured; of these, 3,931 individuals belonged to Coleoptera. A total of 3,825 beetles were identified, belonging to 120 species and 36 families. The most abundant family was Nitidulidae, with 3,297 adults (86% of the total). The number of arthropods differed only in the trapping liquid, and the captures were similar between beer and wine and between vinegar and water. The trapping liquid had a more significant effect on beetle abundance and species richness. In contrast, exposure had a significant effect only on the number of beetle species and a higher ratio of beetles was found in the shade. Beer and wine were very attractive and collected similar beetle communities. However, the diversity (Shannon's index) was low due to the high abundance of several species. Traps with vinegar and water collected a similar composition and species richness. After removing sap beetles (Nitidulidae) from all traps, a significant difference was still recorded between trapping liquids in the number of individuals and species, and their communities were much more similar. Thus, at high abundances of sap beetles, it is possible to exclude them from analyses and obtain more accurate data when assessing environmental variables. The results showed that the type of trapping liquids used can have substantial effects on abundance and species composition captured beetles in traps especially for beer and wine. The beer and wine in traps can significantly influence the subsequent biodiversity assessment. We recommend the use of trapping liquids without the baiting effect to correctly assess the effect of environmental variables on beetle richness and abundance.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammation plays an important role in the immune defense against injury and infection agents. However, the inflammatory chronic process may lead to neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, or cancer. Flavanones present in citrus fruits exhibit biological activities, including anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. The beneficial effects of flavanones have been found based on in vitro cell cultures and animal studies. A suitable in vitro model for studying the inflammatory process are macrophages (RAW264.7 cell line) because, after stimulation using lipopolysaccharide (LPS), they release inflammatory cytokines involved in the immune response. We determined the nitrite concentration in the macrophage cell culture and detected ROS using chemiluminescence. Additionally, we measured the production of selected cytokines using the Bio-Plex Magnetic Luminex Assay and the Bio-PlexTM 200 System. For the first time, we have shown that methyl derivatives of flavanone inhibit NO and chemiluminescence generated via LPS-stimulated macrophages. Moreover, the tested compounds at 1-20 \u00b5M dose-dependently modulate proinflammatory cytokine production (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, and TNF-\u03b1) in stimulated RAW264.7 cells.

        "Title": "Using an embryo specific promoter to modify iron distribution pattern in Arabidopsis.",
        "Abstract": "Iron is an essential micronutrient for life. During the development of the seed, iron accumulates during embryo maturation. In Arabidopsis thaliana, iron mainly accumulates in the vacuoles of only one cell type, the cell layer that surrounds provasculature in hypocotyl and cotyledons. Iron accumulation pattern in Arabidopsis is an exception in plant phylogeny, most part of the dicot embryos accumulate iron in several cell layers including cortex and, in some cases, even in protodermis. It remains unknown how does iron reach the internal cell layers of the embryo, and in particular, the molecular mechanisms responsible of this process. Here, we use transgenic approaches to modify the iron accumulation pattern in an Arabidopsis model. Using the SDH2-3 embryo-specific promoter, we were able to express VIT1 ectopically in both a wild type background and a mutant vit1 background lacking expression of this vacuolar iron transporter. These manipulations modify the iron distribution pattern in Arabidopsis from one cell layer to several cell layers, including protodermis, cortex cells, and the endodermis. Interestingly, total seed iron content was not modified compared with the wild type, suggesting that iron distribution in embryos is not involved in the control of the total iron amount accumulated in seeds. This experimental model can be used to study the processes involved in iron distribution patterning during embryo maturation and its evolution in dicot plants.",

        "Abstract": "Propolis, owing to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, acts as a cariostatic agent, capable of preventing the accumulation of dental plaque and inhibiting inflammation. The anti-inflammatory properties of propolis are attributed to caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), which is present in European propolis. The objective of the conducted study was to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of the Polish ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) and isolated CAPE on stimulated with LPS and IFN-\u03b1, as well as the combination of LPS and IFN-\u03b1. The cytotoxicity of the tested compounds was determined using the MTT assay. The concentrations of specific cytokines released by the HGF-1 cell line following treatment with EEP (25-50 \u00b5g/mL) or CAPE (25-50 \u00b5g/mL) were assessed in the culture supernatant. In the tested concentrations, both CAPE and EEP did not exert cytotoxic effects. Our results demonstrate that CAPE reduces TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in contrast to EEP. Propolis seems effective in stimulating HGF-1 to release IL-6 and IL-8. A statistically significant difference was observed for IL-8 in HGF-1 stimulated by LPS+IFN-\u03b1 and treated EEP at a concentration of 50 \u00b5g/mL (",

        "Abstract": "Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the most common lung cancer worldwide. Secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) are important tumour suppressors and antagonists of the Wnt signalling pathway, which is linked with cancer development. The aim of this study was to evaluate the concentrations of SFRP1, SFRP2, and SFRP5 proteins in tumour and non-tumour (NT) samples obtained from 65 patients with primary NSCLC. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the concentrations of SFRPs in the tissue homogenates. A significantly lower SFRP2 protein concentration was found in the total NSCLC tumour samples and the following NSCLC subtypes: squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC) (",

        "Abstract": "As the number of smartphones increases, so does the number of medical apps. Medical mobile applications are widely used in many medical fields by both patients and doctors. However, there are still few approved mobile applications that can be used in the diagnostic-therapeutic process and radiological apps are affected as well. We conducted our research by classifying radiological applications from the Google Play\u00ae store into appropriate categories, according to our own qualification system developed by researchers for the purposes of this study. In addition, we also evaluated apps from the App Store\u00ae. The radiology application rating system we created has not been previously used in other articles. Out of 228 applications from the Google Play store, only 6 of them were classified as \"A\" category with the highest standard. Apps from the App Store (157) were not categorized due to the lack of download counts, which was necessary in our app-rating system. The vast majority of applications are for educational purposes and are not used in clinical practice. This is due to the need of obtaining special permits and certificates from relevant institutions in order to use them in medical practice. We recommend applications from the Google Play store that have been classified in the \"A\" category, evaluating them as the most valuable. App Store apps data is described and presented in the form of diagrams and tables.",

        "Abstract": "Food neophobia is standard behaviour in child development. It is a complex process and occurs to varying degrees. The symptoms of neophobia can be variable depending on the individual. Food neophobia is a fear of new foods, whereby difficulties in eating and trying unfamiliar foods follow. It is one of the more vital determinants of the number of meals consumed at a young age. Such a process is not a disorder in itself but can lead to one. The highest severity of neophobia occurs between the ages of two and six, but in some children, it lasts beyond age 6. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of food neophobia among children aged 2-7 years, taking into account the method of complementary feeding, the length of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding, the period of introduction of complementary foods, and the use of the BLW method during the period of dietary expansion.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, deep neural networks have enabled countless innovations in the field of image classification. Encouraged by success in this field, researchers worldwide have demonstrated how to use Convolutional Neural Network techniques in medical imaging problems. In this article, the results were obtained through the use of the EfficientNet in the task of classifying 14 different diseases based on chest X-ray images coming from the NIH (National Institutes of Health) ChestX-ray14 dataset. The approach addresses dataset imbalances by introducing a custom split to ensure fair representation. Binary cross entropy loss is utilized to handle the multi-label difficulty. The model architecture comprises an EfficientNet backbone for feature extraction, succeeded by sequential layers including GlobalAveragePooling, Dense, and BatchNormalization. The main contribution of this paper is a proposed solution that outperforms previous state-of-the-art deep learning models average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve-AUC-ROC (score: 84.28%). The usage of the transfer-learning technique and traditional deep learning engineering techniques was shown to enable us to obtain such results on consumer-class GPUs (graphics processing units).",

        "Abstract": "B vitamins such as folate (B9), B6, and B12 are key in one carbon metabolism, which generates methyl donors for DNA methylation. Several studies have linked differential methylation to self-reported intakes of folate and B12, but these estimates can be imprecise, while metabolomic biomarkers can offer an objective assessment of dietary intakes. We explored blood metabolomic biomarkers of folate and vitamins B6 and B12, to carry out epigenome-wide analyses across up to three European cohorts. Associations between self-reported habitual daily B vitamin intakes and 756 metabolites (Metabolon Inc.) were assessed in serum samples from 1064 UK participants from the TwinsUK cohort. The identified B vitamin metabolomic biomarkers were then used in epigenome-wide association tests with fasting blood DNA methylation levels at 430,768 sites from the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in blood samples from 2182 European participants from the TwinsUK and KORA cohorts. Candidate signals were explored for metabolite associations with gene expression levels in a subset of the TwinsUK sample (n\u2009=\u2009297). Metabolomic biomarker epigenetic associations were also compared with epigenetic associations of self-reported habitual B vitamin intakes in samples from 2294 European participants.",

        "Title": "The effect of quaternary ammonium polyethylenimine nanoparticles on bacterial adherence, cytotoxicity, and physical and mechanical properties of experimental dental composites.",
        "Abstract": "A significant problem related to the functioning of resin-based composites for dental fillings is secondary or recurrent caries, which is the reason for the need for repeated treatment. The cross-linked quaternary ammonium polyethylenimine nanoparticles (QA-PEI-NPs) have been shown to be a promising antibacterial agent against different bacteria, including cariogenic ones. However, little is known about the properties of dental dimethacrylate polymer-based composites enriched with QA-PEI-NPs. This research was carried out on experimental composites based on bis-GMA/UDMA/TEGDMA matrix enriched with 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 (wt%) QA-PEI-NPs and reinforced with two glass fillers. The cured composites were tested for their adherence of Streptococcus Mutans bacteria, cell viability (MTT assay) with 48\u00a0h and 10-days extracts , degree of conversion (DC), water sorption (WSO), and solubility (WSL), water contact angle (CA), flexural modulus (E), flexural strength (FS), compressive strength (CS), and Vickers microhardness (HV). The investigated materials have shown a complete reduction in bacteria adherence and satisfactory biocompatibility. The QA-PEI-NPs additive has no effect on the DC, VH, and E values. QA-PEI-NPs increased the CA (a favorable change), the WSO and WSL (unfavorable changes) and decreased flexural strength, and compressive strength (unfavorable changes). The changes mentioned were insignificant and acceptable for most composites, excluding the highest antibacterial filler content. Probably the reason for the deterioration of some properties was low compatibility between filler particles and the matrix; therefore, it is worth extending the research by surface modification of QA-PEI-NPs to achieve the optimum performance characteristics.",

        "Abstract": "Access is considered one of the necessary conditions for achieving effectiveness and quality in health services. However, it represents a complex construct, with several interpretations, and can be understood as the ease or degree of difficulty with which people obtain effective and timely care. Barriers to access can be related to individual characteristics and those of health systems and services. Regarding elderly people living in rural riverine localities, these limitations are exacerbated due to the territorial dispersion of households and the difficulty of obtaining the necessary care near their homes. The aim of this study was to describe and test the association of sarcopenia and physical performance with primary healthcare attributes and the use of health services by elderly people living in rural riverside areas in the Amazon, Brazil.",

        "Title": "Chest X-ray Foreign Objects Detection Using Artificial Intelligence.",
        "Abstract": "Diagnostic imaging has become an integral part of the healthcare system. In recent years, scientists around the world have been working on artificial intelligence-based tools that help in achieving better and faster diagnoses. Their accuracy is crucial for successful treatment, especially for imaging diagnostics. This study used a deep convolutional neural network to detect four categories of objects on digital chest X-ray images. The data were obtained from the publicly available National Institutes of Health (NIH) Chest X-ray (CXR) Dataset. In total, 112,120 CXRs from 30,805 patients were manually checked for foreign objects: vascular port, shoulder endoprosthesis, necklace, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Then, they were annotated with the use of a computer program, and the necessary image preprocessing was performed, such as resizing, normalization, and cropping. The object detection model was trained using the You Only Look Once v8 architecture and the Ultralytics framework. The results showed not only that the obtained average precision of foreign object detection on the CXR was 0.815 but also that the model can be useful in detecting foreign objects on the CXR images. Models of this type may be used as a tool for specialists, in particular, with the growing popularity of radiology comes an increasing workload. We are optimistic that it could accelerate and facilitate the work to provide a faster diagnosis.",

        "Abstract": "Body composition is an important indicator of the overall health and fitness of team sports athletes, including in football, and therefore, anthropometric profiling of elite football players is useful as part of determining their skills, strengths, and weaknesses to develop effective strength and conditioning programs. One of the tools available to coaches to track correlates of performance and health is routine body composition assessment. The purpose of this study is to describe and compare the body composition and anthropometric profiles of players using the Direct Segmental Multi-Frequency Bio-Electrical Impedance Analysis method, and to manage body composition throughout the round in the 2020-2021 season. The investigation was carried out during the Polish football league, PKO BP Ekstraklasa, spring round of the football season 2020-2021, in which male football players participated.

        "Title": "Vision-Related Quality of Life in Danish Patients with Albinism and the Impact of an Updated Optical Rehabilitation.",
        "Abstract": "(1) Background: Albinism is characterized by a lack of pigment in eyes, hair, and skin and developmental changes in the eye such as foveal hypoplasia. Patients require optical rehabilitation due to low vision, refractive errors, and photosensitivity. We aimed to assess vision-related quality of life in patients with albinism and to evaluate how this was affected by optical rehabilitation. (2) Methods: Patients with ocular or oculocutaneous albinism were invited for the study. Free-of-charge optical rehabilitation was provided as needed, including filters, glasses for near or distance, contact lenses, magnifiers or binoculars. Vision-related quality of life was assessed prior to and after optical rehabilitation using the visual function questionnaire (VFQ39) and the effect of optical rehabilitation was evaluated after accounting for age, gender, and visual acuity. (3) Results: Seventy-eight patients filled out the VFQ39 at the initial visit. Fifty patients (64.1%) returned the questionnaire 3-6 months after optical rehabilitation. The mean age of included patients was 35.9 years (standard deviation 16.6), and their best corrected distance visual acuity was 56 ETDRS letters (range 3-81). The VFQ39 composite score improved significantly from a median of 62.5 (range 14.2-77.0) to 76.5 (20.6-99.6). Significant improvements were seen for ocular pain, social functioning, mental health, role difficulties, and dependency, whereas self-assessed distance or near visual functions did not change. (4) Conclusions: Optical rehabilitation improved the self-reported vision-related quality of life in Danish patients with albinism on a number of parameters related to leading an independent and worry-free life, whereas visual improvement for distance and near tasks was likely limited by the nature of the disease and by the fact that most patients already had access to some optical aids prior to the study.",

        "Abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a multifactorial clinical syndrome involving many complex processes. The causes may be related to abnormal heart structure and/or function. Changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the sympathetic nervous system, and the natriuretic peptide system are important in the pathophysiology of HF. Dysregulation or overexpression of these processes leads to changes in cardiac preload and afterload, changes in the vascular system, peripheral vascular dysfunction and remodeling, and endothelial dysfunction. One of the important factors responsible for the development of heart failure at the cellular level is oxidative stress. This condition leads to deleterious cellular effects as increased levels of free radicals gradually disrupt the state of equilibrium, and, as a consequence, the internal antioxidant defense system is damaged. This review focuses on pharmacotherapy for chronic heart failure with regard to oxidation-reduction metabolism, with special attention paid to the latest group of drugs, SGLT2 inhibitors-an integral part of HF treatment. These drugs have been shown to have beneficial effects by protecting the antioxidant system at the cellular level.",

        "Abstract": "Machine learning (ML), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and deep learning (DL) are all topics that fall under the heading of artificial intelligence (AI) and have gained popularity in recent years. ML involves the application of algorithms to automate decision-making processes using models that have not been manually programmed but have been trained on data. ANNs that are a part of ML aim to simulate the structure and function of the human brain. DL, on the other hand, uses multiple layers of interconnected neurons. This enables the processing and analysis of large and complex databases. In medicine, these techniques are being introduced to improve the speed and efficiency of disease diagnosis and treatment. Each of the AI techniques presented in the paper is supported with an example of a possible medical application. Given the rapid development of technology, the use of AI in medicine shows promising results in the context of patient care. It is particularly important to keep a close eye on this issue and conduct further research in order to fully explore the potential of ML, ANNs, and DL, and bring further applications into clinical use in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most frequent worldwide cause of adult population disabilities. The study evaluated the effects of a 21-day individual rehabilitation exercise training program focused on improving patients' functional capacity. The study analyzed the changes in irisin, chemerin, and BDNF serum levels in 36 OA patients subjected to an individually-adjusted rehabilitation program 90 days after surgical hip or knee replacement. The changes in irisin, chemerin, and BDNF serum levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. A 21-day individual rehabilitation exercise training program significantly increased irisin and BDNF, and decreased chemerin serum levels. The presented study indicates that individually-adjusted exercise training is an important modulator influencing serum levels of anti- and pro-inflammatory factors, leading to positive clinical outcomes in osteoarthritis therapy. Selected factors are considered potential markers of various pathophysiological conditions. The presented study brings new details to the discussion.",

        "Abstract": "The relationship between gut microbiota and obesity is well documented in humans and animal models. Dietary factors can change the intestinal microbiota composition and influence obesity development. However, knowledge of how diet, metabolism, and intestinal microbiota interact and modulate energy metabolism and obesity development is still limited. Epidemiological studies show a link between consuming dietary proteins and fats from specific sources and obesity. Animal studies confirm that proteins and fats of different origins differ in their ability to prevent or induce obesity. Protein sources, such as meat, dairy products, vegetables, pulses, and seafood, vary in their amino acid composition. In addition, the type and level of other factors, such as fatty acids or persistent organic pollutants, vary depending on the source of dietary protein. All these factors can modulate the intestinal microbiota composition and, thus, may influence obesity development. This review summarizes selected evidence of how proteins and fats of different origins affect energy efficiency, obesity development, and intestinal microbiota, linking protein and fat-dependent changes in the intestinal microbiota with obesity.",

        "Title": "Propolis as a Cariostatic Agent in Lozenges and Impact of Storage Conditions on the Stability of Propolis.",
        "Abstract": "Propolis is known as a source of compounds with strong antibacterial activity. Due to the antibacterial effect against streptococci of the oral cavity, it seems to be a useful agent in decreasing the accumulation of dental plaque. It is rich in polyphenols which are responsible for a beneficial impact on the oral microbiota and antibacterial effect. The aim of the study was to evaluate the antibacterial effect of Polish propolis against cariogenic bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined on cariogenic streptococci related to the occurrence of dental caries. Lozenges based on xylitol, glycerin, gelatin, water, and ethanol extract of propolis (EEP) were prepared. The effect of prepared lozenges on cariogenic bacteria was assessed. Propolis was compared to chlorhexidine which is used in dentistry as the gold standard. In addition, the prepared propolis formulation was stored under stress conditions to assess the influence of physical conditions (i.e., temperature, relative humidity, and UV radiation). In the experiment, thermal analyses were also performed to evaluate the compatibility of propolis with the substrate used to create the base of lozenges. The observed antibacterial effect of propolis and prepared lozenges with EEP may suggest directing subsequent research on prophylactic and therapeutic properties decreasing the accumulation of dental plaque. Therefore, it is worth highlighting that propolis may play an important role in the management of dental health and bring advantages in preventing periodontal diseases and caries as well as dental plaque. The colorimetric analyses carried out in the CIE L*a*b* system, microscopic examinations, and TGA/DTG/c-DTA measurements indicate the unfavorable effect of the tested storage conditions on the lozenges with propolis. This fact is particularly evident for lozenges stored under stress conditions, i.e., 40 \u00b0C/75% RH/14 days, and lozenges exposed to UVA radiation for 60 min. In addition, the obtained thermograms of the tested samples indicate the thermal compatibility of the ingredients used to create the formulation of lozenges.",

        "Abstract": "The study aimed to assess the expression of B7H3 concerning clinicopathological and histological parameters, including MSI/MSS status, CD-8 cells, tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), budding, TNM scale and grading. Moreover, we analyzed the B7H3-related pathways using available online datasets and the immunological context of B7H3 expression, through the 48-cytokine screening panel of cancer tissues homogenates, immunogenic features and immune composition. The study included 158 patients diagnosed with CRC. To assess B7H3 levels, we performed an immunohistochemistry method (IHC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To elucidate the immune composition of colorectal cancer, we performed the Bio-Plex Pro Human 48-cytokine panel. To study biological characteristics of B7H3, we used online databases. Expression of B7H3 was upregulated in CRC tumour tissues in comparison to adjacent noncancerous margin tissues. The concentrations of B7H3 in tumours were positively associated with T parameter of patients and negatively with tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes score. Additionally, Principal Component Analysis showed that B7H3 expression in tumours correlated positively with cytokines associated with M2-macrophages and protumour growth factors. The expression of B7H3 in tumours was independent of MSI/MSS status. These findings will improve our understanding of B7H3 role in colorectal cancer immunity. Our study suggests that B7-H3 is a promising potential target for cancer therapy. Further studies must clarify the mechanisms of B7H3 overexpression and its therapeutic importance in colorectal cancer.",

The only two cave complexes studied, Machico and S\u00e3o Vicente, lack protection measures. S\u00e3o Vicente is seriously threatened because it is being exploited for touristic purposes, while the Machico complex, the only one in its natural state, is open to the public but without any control. The importance of the conservation of this cave fauna is indisputable. So far, of the 13 cavernicolous species recorded, two of them-genus ",

        "Abstract": "In recent years PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have gained the interest of scientists, mainly because of their possible implications in cancer. Many kinds of research showed how their expression can be linked to malignant diseases. However, most of them evaluated the expression of piRNAs in tumor tissues. It was shown how these non-coding RNAs can interfere with many signaling pathways involved in the regulation of proliferation or apoptosis. A comparison of piRNA expression in tumor tissue and adjacent healthy tissues has demonstrated they can be used as biomarkers. However, this way of obtaining samples has a significant drawback, which is the invasiveness of such a procedure. Liquid biopsy is an alternative for acquiring biological material with little to no harm to a patient. Several different piRNAs in various types of cancer were shown to be expressed in bodily fluids such as blood or urine. Furthermore, their expression significantly differed between cancer patients and healthy individuals. Hence, this review aimed to assess the possible use of liquid biopsy for cancer diagnosis with piRNAs as biomarkers.",

        "Abstract": "The effects of specific cytokines produced by T cell subsets (such as Th1, Th2, and newly discovered Th17, Treg, Tfh, or Th22) are diverse, depending on interactions with other cytokines, distinct signaling pathways, phase of the disease, or etiological factor. The immunity equilibrium of the immune cells, such as the Th1/Th2, the Th17/Treg, and the Th17/Th1 balance is necessary for the maintenance of the immune homeostasis. If the balance of the T cells subsets is damaged, the autoimmune response becomes enhanced which leads to autoimmune diseases. Indeed, both the Th1/Th2 and the Th17/Treg dichotomies are involved in the pathomechanism of autoimmune diseases. The aim of the study was to determine the cytokines of Th17 lymphocytes as well as the factors modulating their activity in patients with pernicious anemia. The magnetic bead-based immunoassays used (Bio-Plex) allow simultaneous detection of multiple immune mediators from one serum sample. In our study, we showed that patients suffering from pernicious anemia develop the Th1/Th2 imbalance with a quantitative advantage of cytokines participating in Th1-related immune response, the Th17/Treg imbalance with a quantitative advantage of cytokines participating in Treg-related response, as well as the Th17/Th1 imbalance with a quantitative predominance of cytokines participating in Th1-related immune response. Our study results indicate that T lymphocytes and their specific cytokines play an role in the course of pernicious anemia. The observed changes may indicate the immune response to pernicious anemia or be an element of the pernicious anemia pathomechanism.",

        "Abstract": "The extension of human life makes it more and more important to prevent and treat diseases of the elderly, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and osteoporosis. Little is known about the effects of drugs used in the treatment of AD on the musculoskeletal system. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on the musculoskeletal system in rats with normal and reduced estrogen levels. The study was carried out on four groups of mature female rats: non-ovariectomized (NOVX) control rats, NOVX rats treated with donepezil, ovariectomized (OVX) control rats and OVX rats treated with donepezil. Donepezil (1 mg/kg p.o.) was administered for four weeks, starting one week after the ovariectomy. The serum concentrations of CTX-I, osteocalcin and other biochemical parameters, bone mass, density, mineralization, histomorphometric parameters and mechanical properties, and skeletal muscle mass and strength were examined. Estrogen deficiency increased bone resorption and formation and worsened cancellous bone mechanical properties and histomorphometric parameters. In NOVX rats, donepezil decreased bone volume to tissue volume ratio in the distal femoral metaphysis, increased the serum phosphorus concentration and tended to decrease skeletal muscle strength. No significant bone effects of donepezil were observed in OVX rats. The results of the present study indicate slightly unfavorable effects of donepezil on the musculoskeletal system in rats with normal estrogen levels.",

        "Abstract": "Memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). NMDA receptors are expressed on bone cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of memantine on the rat musculoskeletal system. Taking into account that most of female AD patients are postmenopausal, the study was carried out on intact and ovariectomized (estrogen-deficient) rats. Mature Wistar rats were divided into following groups: non-ovariectomized (NOVX) control rats, NOVX rats treated with memantine, ovariectomized (OVX) control rats, and OVX rats treated with memantine. Memantine (2\u00a0mg/kg p.o.) was administered once daily for four weeks, starting one week after ovariectomy. The serum bone turnover marker and cytokine levels, bone density, mass, mineralization, mechanical properties, histomorphometric parameters of compact and cancellous bone, skeletal muscle mass and grip strength were determined. In NOVX rats, memantine slightly decreased the strength of compact bone of the femoral diaphysis (parameters in the yield point) and unfavorably affected histomorphometric parameters of cancellous bone (the femoral epiphysis and metaphysis). In OVX rats, in which estrogen deficiency induced osteoporotic changes, memantine increased the phosphorus content in the femoral bone mineral. No other effects on bone were observed in the memantine-treated OVX rats. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated slight damaging skeletal effects of memantine in rats with normal estrogen levels.",

        "Abstract": "The influence of chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40 or CHI3L1) expression on the immunological properties of the tumor microenvironment, which may affect the effectiveness of immunotherapy, is currently not sufficiently understood in colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between YKL-40 expression and the immunological properties of the tumor microenvironment in CRC. We performed in silico analysis, including analysis of immune cell infiltration scores and the immune landscape depending on YKL-40 expression, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and analysis of three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. In 48 CRC tissue homogenates and the surgical margin, we analyzed the expression of YKL-40, MMP8, IL17A, and PD-L1. Moreover, we analyzed the expression of YKL-40 in tissue homogenates retrieved from patients with coexisting diabetes, obesity, and smoking. The expression of YKL-40 was significantly higher in CRC tumor tissue compared to healthy tissue and correlated with MMP-8, IL17A, and PD-L1 expression. In silico analysis revealed an association of YKL-40 with disease recurrence, and GSEA revealed a potential link between elevated YKL-40 expression and immunosuppressive properties of the tumor microenvironment in CRC.",

        "Abstract": "New psychoactive substances continue to appear on the drug market, and alpha-pyrrolidinoisohexanophenone (\u03b1-PiHP) is one of the most popular cathinone derivatives. In this article, we report a case of death caused by \u03b1-PiHP. Based on the toxicological results of the studied case along with autopsy, histopathological findings and crime-scene information, fatal intoxication with \u03b1-PiHP was accepted as the final cause of death. \u03b1-PiHP and its metabolite (OH-\u03b1-PiHP) were detected and quantified in all postmortem materials (blood collected from the heart, the femoral vein and the dural venous sinuses; vitreous humor; cerebrospinal fluid; cerebral cortex; brainstem; cerebellum; bile; liver; kidney; heart; pancreas; spleen; thyroid gland; lung; adipose tissue; stomach and intestine). To date, this is the first case of determination of \u03b1-PiHP and its metabolite in postmortem specimens. In our opinion, \u03b1-PiHP and its metabolite concentration database can be helpful in the interpretation of fatal cases.",

The pathogenesis, however, has not been yet established. The clinical course of the disease is characterized by frequent relapses. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, that apart from its involvement in the immune system, was found to be playing a vital role in various cells' functioning, including renal tissue. It is desirable to look for new predictors of INS. Our study aimed to evaluate IL-15 as a potential marker in the early diagnosis of the disease. The cohort participating in the study consisted of patients hospitalized in Clinical Hospital No. 1 in Zabrze, from December 2019 to December 2021, including study group with INS (",

        "Abstract": "Iron is a transition metal that plays a crucial role in several physiological processes. It can also exhibit toxic effects on cells, due to its role in the formation of free radicals. Iron deficiency and anemia, as well as iron overload, are the result of impaired iron metabolism, in which a number of proteins, such as hepcidin, hemojuvelin and transferrin, take part. Iron deficiency is common in individuals with renal and cardiac transplants, while iron overload is more common in patients with hepatic transplantation. The current knowledge about iron metabolism in lung graft recipients and donors is limited. The problem is even more complex when we consider the fact that iron metabolism may be also driven by certain drugs used by graft recipients and donors. In this work, we overview the available literature reports on iron turnover in the human body, with particular emphasis on transplant patients, and we also attempt to assess the drugs' impact on iron metabolism, which may be useful in perioperative treatment in transplantology.",

        "Title": "Overexpression and Role of HHLA2, a Novel Immune Checkpoint, in Colorectal Cancer.",
        "Abstract": "The study aimed to investigate correlations between HHLA2 levels and parameters, including microsatellite instability (MSI) status, CD8+ cells, and histopathological features: budding, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), TNM scale, grading, cytokines, chemokines, and cell signaling moleculesin colorectal cancer (CRC). Furthermore, the immune infiltration landscape and HHLA2-related pathways in colorectal cancer using available online datasets were analyzed. The study included 167 patients diagnosed with CRC. Expression of HHLA2 was detected by immunohistochemistry method (IHC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IHC was used to evaluate the MSI and CD8+ status. The budding and TILs were measured using a light microscope. The concentrations of cytokines, chemokines, and cell signaling molecules were measured to analyze the data by the Bio-Plex Pro Human cytokine screening panel, 48 cytokine assay, and principal component analysis (PCA). Geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to identify HHLA2-related pathways. The biological function of HHLA2 was predicted by Gene Ontology (GO). Analysis of the immune infiltration landscape of HHLA2 in colorectal cancer was made by the web-based tool Camoip. High HHLA2 expression was detected in CRC tumor tissues compared to the adjacent noncancerous tissues. The percentage of HHLA2-positive tumors was 97%. GSEA and GO showed that HHLA2 upregulation correlated with cancer-related pathways and several biological functions. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes score correlated positively with IHC HHLA2 expression level percentage. There was a negative correlation between HHLA2, anti-tumor cytokines and pro-tumor growth factors. This study provides a valuable insight into the role of HHLA2 in CRC. We reveal the role of HHLA2 expression as well as a stimulatory and inhibitory immune checkpoint in colorectal cancer. Further research may verify the therapeutic values of the HHLA2-KIR3DL3/TMIGD2 pathway in colorectal cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is considered to be the seventh most common cause of cancer-related deaths. The number of deaths caused by PC is estimated to increase in the future. An early diagnosis of PC is crucial for improving treatment outcomes. The most common histopathological subtype of PC is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). MicroRNAs (miRNAs)-which are endogenous non-coding RNAs involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of multiple gene expression-constitute useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in various neoplasms, including PDAC. Circulating miRNAs detected in a patient's serum or plasma are drawing more and more attention. Hence, this review aims at evaluating the clinical value of circulating miRNA in the screening, diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma therapy.",

        "Title": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Roasted Pork Meat and the Effect of Dried Fruits on PAH Content.",
        "Abstract": "Diet is one of the main factors affecting human health. The frequent consumption of heat-treated meat has been classified as both directly carcinogenic to humans and as a risk factor, especially in the case of cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. Thermally processed meat may contain harmful muta- and carcinogenic compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However, there are natural ways to reduce the risk of diet-related cancers by reducing the formation of PAHs in meat. The purpose of this study was to determine changes in PAH levels in pork loin dishes prepared by stuffing the meat with dried fruits (prunes, apricots and cranberries) and baking it in a roasting bag. High-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) was used to conduct a quantitative analysis of seven PAHs. Recovery results ranged from 61 to 96%. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.003 to 0.006 ng/g, and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.01 to 0.02 ng/g. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) was used to confirm the presence of PAHs in food. The total PAH content of the roasted pork loin was 7.4 ng/g. This concentration decreased by 35%, 48% and 58% when the meat was roasted with apricots, prunes and cranberries, respectively. The cranberries also inhibited the formation of benzo(a)pyrene to the greatest extent. Thermally treating meat stuffed with dry fruits may be a simple and effective way to prepare foods with reduced levels of mutagens and carcinogens belonging to PAHs, and thus reduce the risk of cancer.",

        "Abstract": "The immunotherapies based on ICIs in CRC are nowadays limited to microsatellite unstable tumours which are approximately 15% of all CRC cases. There are a few new immune checkpoints belonging to the B7 family, including B7H4. B7H4 expression is associated with so-called \"cold tumours\", and its function is linked to the downregulation of various immune cell populations. Our study aimed to investigate whether B7H4 expression is dependent on microsatellite status in CRC and on elucidating the immunological context in which the expression of B7H4 occurs. We enrolled 167 patients in the study. We prepared the homogenates from tumour tissues and healthy adjacent tissue to assess the B7H4 levels and the Bio-Plex Pro Human 48-cytokine panel. We assessed the microsatellite status of the tumour, B7H4 expression, CD8+ T cell population, and the TILs and budding in H + E stained slides by the IHC method. We used an online available database for further exploring the biological characteristics of B7H4. The expression of B7H4 was more frequent in microsatellite stable tumours, and was negatively associated with TILs. B7H4 is positively correlated with antitumour immunosuppressive iTME, thus contributing to the immunosuppressive environment in CRC.",

        "Abstract": "In forensic anthropology, the differential diagnosis between peri- and postmortem bone fractures is mainly based on macroscopic criteria. In contrast, studies focusing on bone histology are very scarce. In a recent publication, we showed that (perimortem) fractures in fresh human bones exhibit a different osteonal microcracking pattern than (postmortem) damage in dry bones. In the current work, we explored whether this osteonal microcracking pattern is distinctive of the vitality of (perimortem) fresh bone fractures. To this end, we compared the number, length and structural distribution of microcracks in vital humeral fractures from forensic autopsy cases with experimentally reproduced, three point-bending fractures in fresh and dry human humeri. Half of the fresh experimental bones were fractured whilst applying axial compression, i.e., attempting to simulate intra vitam conditions more accurately. The results showed a similar osteonal microcracking pattern between vital fractures and experimental fractures of fresh humeri subjected to axial compression. Interestingly, this pattern was significantly different from the one observed in the experimental fractures of fresh humeri without axial compression and dry humeri. This supports our hypothesis that the osteonal microcracking pattern can potentially be used as a marker for vital perimortem trauma, providing a histomorphometric tool for fracture timing.",

        "Abstract": "The application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to MRI data has emerged as a promising approach to achieving unprecedented levels of accuracy when predicting the course of neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, by means of extracting image features not detectable through conventional methods. Additionally, the study of CNN-derived attention maps, which indicate the most relevant anatomical features for CNN-based decisions, has the potential to uncover key disease mechanisms leading to disability accumulation. From a cohort of patients prospectively followed up after a first demyelinating attack, we selected those with T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR brain MRI sequences available for image analysis and a clinical assessment performed within the following six months (N\u00a0=\u00a0319). Patients were divided into two groups according to expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score: \u22653.0 and\u00a0<\u00a03.0. A 3D-CNN model predicted the class using whole-brain MRI scans as input. A comparison with a logistic regression (LR) model using volumetric measurements as explanatory variables and a validation of the CNN model on an independent dataset with similar characteristics (N\u00a0=\u00a0440) were also performed. The layer-wise relevance propagation method was used to obtain individual attention maps. The CNN model achieved a mean accuracy of 79% and proved to be superior to the equivalent LR-model (77%). Additionally, the model was successfully validated in the independent external cohort without any re-training (accuracy\u00a0=\u00a071%). Attention-map analyses revealed the predominant role of frontotemporal cortex and cerebellum for CNN decisions, suggesting that the mechanisms leading to disability accrual exceed the mere presence of brain lesions or atrophy and probably involve how damage is distributed in the central nervous system.",

        "Abstract": "Heavy metal poisoning can have serious health consequences, including damage to the brain, kidneys, and other organs. Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal that can accumulate in the body over time and the exposure to this element has been linked to a variety of adverse health effects. Cadmium toxicity can lead to an imbalance in the cellular redox state and be a source of oxidative stress. On the molecular level, cadmium ions negatively affect cellular metabolism, including the disruption of energy production, protein synthesis, and DNA damage. The study has been carried out on a group of 140 school-age children (8 to 14 years old) inhabiting the industrialized areas of Upper Silesia. The study population was divided into two sub-groups based on the median concentration of cadmium in blood (0.27 \u00b5g/L): Low-CdB and High-CdB. Measured traits comprised blood cadmium levels (CdB) as well as a blood count and selected oxidative stress markers. This research study aimed to demonstrate a correlation between the impact of exposure to elevated cadmium concentrations in a population of children and certain markers of oxidative stress, and 25-OH vitamin D3 concentration. A negative correlation has been found between cadmium concentration and 25-OH vitamin D3 level, protein sulfhydryl groups content in blood serum, glutathione reductase activity, and lipofuscin and malondialdehyde levels in erythrocytes. The concentration of 25-OH vitamin D",

        "Abstract": "Recently, there has been a significant increase in the number of patients hospitalized and undergoing surgery due to parotid gland tumors. We have observed an increase in the total number of salivary gland tumors, and hence an increased number of malignant tumors. Etiological factors of salivary gland tumors are still unknown. Oxidative stress (OS) has been suggested to be an important indicator of carcinogenesis in some tumors. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the state of OS in patients with selected benign and malignant parotid gland tumors. After final postoperative histological diagnosis of the tumor, patients were divided into the following groups i.e. pleomorphic adenoma 35 patients, Warthins tumor (WT) - 17 patients, mucoepidermoid carcinoma - 9 patients and 45 controls. The final study group included 106 patients. We found an increase in plasma lipofuscin levels in patients with all investigated parotid gland tumors. Furthermore, the activity of Cu/Zn-SOD in Warthins tumor patients was statistically lower compared to the controls, pleomorphic adenoma or mucoepidermoid carcinoma.In conclusion, we sustain the hypothesis on the presence of a low intensity whole-body OS in patients with parotid gland tumors. Furthermore, LPS may be a useful marker of OS in patients with benign and malignant tumors. Moreover, pathological mechanisms connected with WT seem to be different compared to malignant neoplasms and other benign tumors. It seems that Cu/Zn-SOD, as an antioxidative enzyme, may play an important role in those mechanisms taking part in WT.",

        "Abstract": "The optimal body composition for health is an individual trait and is determined by genetic factors, sex, age, somatotype, physical activity, and individual variability. The present study aims to assess how professional football players' body composition has changed over the training macrocycle in various age groups and to determine the correlation between nutritional awareness and body composition maintenance. Thirty-eight football players participated in the study, with 16 players classified in the younger age group (19-25) and 22 in the older age group (26-31). Using the direct segmented multi-frequency electrical impedance analysis technique, the athletes' body composition was assessed six times across a training macrocycle made up of preparatory, competitive, and transitional periods. The Sports Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire was used to evaluate nutrition knowledge. The above correlations show that both younger and older athletes with higher awareness are better able to adjust their nutrition to meet the goals of the preparation period and can achieve greater gains in muscle mass and greater reductions in body fat. According to the study's results, athletes who are better conscious of their nutritional needs during competition experience less muscle loss and exhibit more consistent body weight and BMI levels. Football players' body composition suffers detrimental alterations throughout the transition period. Higher body mass, lean body mass content, and skeletal muscle mass are traits of older players. Higher nutritional knowledge reduces the negative modifications of body composition consisting of muscle mass reduction and fat gain. Nutritional knowledge influences the stability of body composition in both age groups during all the analyzed periods: Preparation, competition, and transition.",

This study aimed to assess the level of readiness of hospitals in Jordan to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic using the WHO hospital readiness checklist. A cross-sectional survey using the modified and validated checklist was conducted in Jordan between 15 May and 15 June 2021. The checklist entailed ten key response functions with a total of 60 activities. Data from 22 hospitals were collected through a structured survey process by two surveyors for each hospital. The overall readiness score of hospitals was 1.77 \u00b1 0.20, with a lower overall score in the northern region (1.65 \u00b1 0.24) than the middle (1.86 \u00b1 0.07) or southern (1.84 \u00b1 0.14) regions. The diagnosis response function scored highest (1.95); but despite efforts, contingency plan development was not met by most hospitals, with a total score \u2264 1.45. Provision of psychological support and occupational health support to ensure the wellbeing of staff scored below average. Outcomes from this survey exposed gaps while offering a framework for upcoming endeavors to improve hospital readiness for any potential pandemic.",

        "Abstract": "GSK3\u03b2 has been proposed to have an essential role in Coronaviridae infections. Screening of a targeted library of GSK3\u03b2 inhibitors against both SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E to identify broad-spectrum anti-Coronaviridae inhibitors resulted in the identification of a high proportion of active compounds with low toxicity to host cells. A selected lead compound, T-1686568, showed low micromolar, dose-dependent activity against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E. T-1686568 showed efficacy in viral-infected cultured cells and primary 2D organoids. T-1686568 also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern Delta and Omicron. Importantly, while inhibition by T-1686568 resulted in the overall reduction of viral load and protein translation, GSK3\u03b2 inhibition resulted in cellular accumulation of the nucleocapsid protein relative to the spike protein. Following identification of potential phosphorylation sites of Coronaviridae nucleocapsid, protein kinase substrate profiling assays combined with Western blotting analysis of nine host kinases showed that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid could be phosphorylated by GSK3\u03b2 and PKCa. GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylated SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid on the S180/S184, S190/S194 and T198 phospho-sites, following previous priming in the adjacent S188, T198 and S206, respectively. Such inhibition presents a compelling target for broad-spectrum anti-Coronaviridae compound development, and underlies the mechanism of action of GSK3\u03b2 host-directed therapy against this class of obligate intracellular pathogens.",

        "Abstract": "Multimorbidity is increasing and poses a challenge to the clinical management of patients with multiple conditions and drug prescriptions. The objectives of this work are to evaluate if multimorbidity patterns are associated with quality indicators of medication: potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) or adverse drug reactions (ADRs). A multicentre prospective cohort study was conducted including 740 older (\u226565 years) patients hospitalised due to chronic pathology exacerbation. Sociodemographic, clinical and medication related variables (polypharmacy, PIP according to STOPP/START criteria, ADRs) were collected. Bivariate analyses were performed comparing previously identified multimorbidity clusters (osteoarticular, psychogeriatric, minor chronic disease, cardiorespiratory) to presence, number or specific types of PIP or ADRs. Significant associations were found in all clusters. The osteoarticular cluster presented the highest prevalence of PIP (94.9%) and ADRs (48.2%), mostly related to anxiolytics and antihypertensives, followed by the minor chronic disease cluster, associated with ADRs caused by antihypertensives and insulin. The psychogeriatric cluster presented PIP and ADRs of neuroleptics and the cardiorespiratory cluster indicators were better overall. In conclusion, the associations that were found reinforce the existence of multimorbidity patterns and support specific medication review actions according to each patient profile. Thus, determining the relationship between multimorbidity profiles and quality indicators of medication could help optimise healthcare processes. Trial registration number: NCT02830425.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents the results of a study on the applicability of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from the spinal canal in the post-mortem determination of ethyl alcohol. The present study reviewed data of autopsy cases (n\u2009=\u200945), in which ethyl alcohol was detected in CSF using gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (HS-GC-FID), to investigate ethyl alcohol concentrations in CSF, compared with blood. As a result of statistical analysis of the obtained data, a high positive correlation was found between blood ethanol concentration and cerebrospinal fluid collected from the spinal canal ethanol concentration. The Pearson correlation coefficient was statistically highly significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001) (r\u2009=\u20090.9503). The data obtained allowed us to conclude that cerebrospinal fluid collected from the spinal canal can be collected during an autopsy as an alternative biological specimen to assess the ethanol content. Cerebrospinal fluid collected from the spinal canal can corroborate and lend credibility to the results obtained for blood and, in special cases, when blood is drawn from putrefied bodies and may even be a superior specimen to blood for assessing ethyl alcohol intoxication status.",

        "Abstract": "Polymers are becoming a very popular tool in the crystallization of different compounds. In this work, a new method of crystallization is proposed using stimuli-responsive star polymer in order to obtain hollow structure crystals. In these experiments, amphiphilic copolymer of acrylic acid (AA) and methyl acrylate (MA) were used for isohydric crystallization via they cooling of KCl in deionized water solution. The experiments were realized in quartz cuvette with a magnetic stirrer using a specialized spectrometer with precise temperature control. The crystallization course was monitored by the absorbance readings and analysis of the nucleation energetic effect. It was proved that the moment of the polymer's phase transition occurrence had an important role in the crystal growth process. On the other hand, the occurrence of phase transition did not trigger the nucleation. The supercoolings achieved in the presence of the polymer were significantly higher compared to pure salt crystallization. On the basis of analysis of Particle Size Distribution (PSD) and Critical Aggregation Concentration (CAC) of the polymer, it was proposed that the hydrophobic particles of macromolecules created from polymeric aggregates served as templates for the formation of hollow crystals. Their purity was verified using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), 1H NMR, and XRD. Only trace amounts of polymer were found in the crystalline product.",

The study was conducted among 1098 parents during the first lockdown in Poland. An originally developed questionnaire was used as the research tool. The Wilcoxon test was used to determine the frequency of differences in the lifestyle of parents and children before the pandemic and during lockdown. Differences were found in the frequency of healthy habits in the periods under investigation, both in the lifestyle of parents and children. A moderately healthy lifestyle was predominant among families with children aged 4-8 years during lockdown. The families' lifestyle significantly changed in relation to the time before the pandemic. There is a need for lifestyle education for families with children to prevent the development of bad habits during and after the pandemic and isolation time.",

        "Abstract": "Background. We sought to measure the levels of adipokines, TNF-\u03b1 and soluble receptors (sTNFr1, sTNFr2) in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) due to non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (nDCM). Methods. A total of 123 patients with HFrEF due to nDCM were divided into three groups according to BMI: 34 (27.6%) normal weight, 56 (45.5%) overweight and 33 (26.8%) obese. A six-minute walk test, echocardiography and right heart catheterization were performed. Serum concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, NT-proBNP, blood hemoglobin, sodium, creatinine, ALAT, AspAT, bilirubin, CRP, lipids, TNF-\u03b1, sTNFr1 and sTNFr2 receptors were measured. Results. Obese patients had the lowest NT-proBNP concentrations, significantly higher leptin levels and higher leptin/adiponectin ratios. The concentration of sTNFr1 was higher in normal-weight patients. In all groups, TNF-\u03b1 concentrations correlated positively with sTNFr1 (p < 0.001). Higher levels of sTNFr1 were associated with higher sTNFr2 (p < 0.001) and CRP (p < 0.001). Moreover, the concentration of sTNFr2 positively correlated with CRP (p < 0.05) and adiponectin (p < 0.001). Levels of TNF-\u03b1 were not associated with elevated CRP. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that changes in the concentrations of TNF and its receptors differ between groups of patients with different BMI. These findings suggest that the effective use of anti-TNF therapy is dependent not only on BMI, but also on concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 receptors and other laboratory parameters.",

        "Title": "Responding to the need of postgraduate education for Planetary Health: Development of an online Master's Degree.",
        "Abstract": "Planetary Health has emerged as a new approach to respond to the existential risks that the clime and global environmental crises pose to human societies. As stated by various stakeholders, the challenges involved in Planetary Health are of such magnitude that education must be at the forefront to obtain a meaningful response. Universities and higher education institutions have been specifically called to embed the concept of planetary stewardship in all curricula and train the next generation of researchers and change makers as a matter of urgency. As a response to this call, the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC), the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), and the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) developed the first online and asynchronous Master in Science (MSc) in Planetary Health. The aim of the programme is to train a new generation of academics and professionals who understand the challenges of Planetary Health and have tools to tackle them. This article describes the development of the curriculum of this MSc, presents the main characteristics of the programme and discusses some of the challenges encountered in the development of the programme and its implementation. The design of this MSc was based on: the alignment of the programme with the principles for Planetary Health education with a focus on human health; a multi-, inter-, and trans-disciplinary approach; the urgency to respond to the Anthropocene challenges; and the commitment to the 2030 Agenda. The MSc was recognized as an official degree by the Agency for Quality of the Catalan University System, included in the European Quality Assurance Register for Higher Education, and the Spanish National Academic Coordination body in April 2021 and launched in October 2021. There are currently more than 50 students enrolled in the program coming from a broad range of disciplines and geographic locations. The information presented in this article and the discussion on challenges encountered in developing and implementing the programme can be useful for those working in the development of similar programs.",

        "Abstract": "This study attempts to determine whether the increased blood lead concentration affects the posturographic test and to determine the relationship between the parameters of posture stability and selected parameters of oxidative stress. The study population consisted of 268 male employees and was divided into two equal subgroups, depending on the lead content in the blood. A posturographic examination was performed. Concentrations of lead, cadmium, zinc protoporphyrin, selected essential elements, and selected markers of oxidative stress in the blood were tested. Higher blood lead concentrations positively affected the values of the sway results: the field and the mean velocity of the center of the feet pressure in posturography. The absolute value of the proprioception ratio was similar in both subgroups. The content of malondialdehyde shows a statistically significantly higher value in a subgroup with high blood lead concentration and exhibits significant correlations only with some of the posturography parameters. The lipofuscin content in erythrocytes correlates with the results of the posturography test. Zinc protoporphyrin, total oxidant status, total antioxidant capacity, selected minerals, and metals did not correlate with the results of the posturography test. In conclusion, posturographic results correlate only with selected markers of oxidative stress, so it can be assumed that the effect on the body balance is only partial.",

        "Abstract": "Heat treatment of meat can lead to the formation of carcinogenic organic compounds. The influence of dried fruits on the formation of non-polar heterocyclic aromatic amines (carbolines) and nitrogen derivatives of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (azaarenes) in roasted pork loin was elucidated. Two hundred grams of fruit per 1 kg of meat were used as stuffing. Carbolines, derivatives of pyridoimidazole and pyridoindole, and azaarenes (benzoacridines and dibenzoacridines) were determined by means of high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The total concentration of six \u03b4-, \u03b3- and \u03b1-carbolines in roasted pork loin was 1.3 ng/g. This content decreased by 64%, 58%, and 54% in pork loin stuffed with prunes, apricots, and cranberries, respectively. Concentrations of \u03b2-carbolines (harmane and norharmane) increased under the influence of added fruits. The norharmane content increased the most, from 2.2 ng/g in the control sample to 12.3 ng/g in meat prepared with cranberries. The harmane content increased from 1.0 ng/g to 3.6 ng/g in meat with prunes. The total concentration of azaarenes (two benzoacridines and dibenzo[",

The industry standard for assessing efficiency is liveweight gain per day, however, this metric is limited in that it values each day of a growing animal's life as equally costly, despite the increasing maintenance requirements, inputs, and emissions associated with increasing liveweight. Quantifying the area under the growth curve (AUC) considers both time and liveweight as a cost and therefore may hold potential as a better estimate of cost, impact, and efficiency in beef systems. Liveweight data was taken from 439 finishing beef cattle split across three herds grazing on different pastures, known as 'farmlets'. Analysis was conducted in three parts: [1] Validation of AUC as a proxy for costs using data from a sub-set of 87 animals that had been part of a previous life cycle assessment (LCA) study in which dry matter intake (DMI), methane emissions (CH",

        "Abstract": "Over-nutrition with cafeteria diet leads to glycemic control failure and subsequent obesity. Bariatric surgery remains the ultimate treatment option, and when complemented with specific dietary protocol, it may mitigate the effects of oxidative stress induced by a cafeteria diet. The study measured antioxidant marker activity: superoxidase dismutase (SOD) and ceruloplasmin (CER), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and lipid peroxidation marker concentrations: lipofuscin (LS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), in the plasma of 56 Sprague-Dawley rats fed with a cafeteria (HFS) or a control (CD) diet and subjected to duodenojejunal omega switch (DJOS) or control (SHAM) surgery. The diet change after the surgery (CD/HFS or HFS/CD) strongly influenced SOD activity in DJOS- and SHAM-operated rats, but SOD activity was always higher in SHAM-operated rats. Every dietary protocol used in the study increased CER activity, except for the CD/CD combination. Cafeteria diet consumed before or after either of surgeries led to decrease in TAC levels. DJOS and no change in diet reduced MDA levels. DJOS reduced LS levels, but its beneficial effect was deteriorated by selected dietary protocols. The cafeteria diet negatively affected the positive impact of DJOS surgery, but SOD, CER, MDA, and LS were significantly lower in rats that underwent DJOS, suggesting that eight weeks of dietary treatment before and after the surgery did not totally dilapidate the effects of the bariatric treatment.",

Among sport-specific pressures, the type of sport is a predictor of body image dissatisfaction. The study included 150 females: 50 volleyball players, 50 bodybuilding and fitness athletes, and 50 female students, who were the control group. Body composition and perception and evaluation of one's own body were assessed. BMI was similar in the study group of female athletes and the control group, but the bodybuilding and fitness athletes had the lowest body fat, while the control group had the highest. Perception of one's own body in the aspect of the evaluation of specific body parts was highest among bodybuilding and fitness athletes, while in the aspect of body condition, the best results were obtained by volleyball players. Most female volleyball players were dissatisfied with their current body weight, as were women in the control group, in contrast to female bodybuilding and fitness athletes, who were most often satisfied with their current body weight.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to assess the magnitude of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers and Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) test results following administration of booster BNT162b2 in 48 ChAd-primed participants (vaccination schedule: ChAd/ChAd/BNT). Whole blood samples were collected: first, before and second, 21 days after the booster dose. The IgG level was measured using chemiluminescent immunoassay; the intensity of the T-cell response-IFN\u03b3 concentration-was assessed using IGRA test. At 21 days after the booster, all subjects achieved reactive/positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and IGRA test results showed a significant increase compared to the results before booster administration. We compared the results before and after the booster between participants with and without prior history of COVID-19. The IFN\u03b3 concentrations in both cohorts were higher in convalescents (both before booster and 21 days after). The IgG titers were subtly lower in COVID-19 convalescents than in na\u00efve but without statistical significance. Data on cell-mediated immunity are scarce, especially with regard to the general population. A better understanding of the complexity of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 could contribute to developing more effective vaccination strategies.",

P. hyrcanicus sp. nov. seem to be especially similar to Pseudachorutes dubius Krausbauer, 1898 and Pseudachorutes vitalii Kaprus Weiner, 2009, two congeners with the same labral formula (4/2,3,4), shape of apical bulb (trilobed) and details of chaetotaxy (unpaired chaeta d1 present and a0 absent on head, a2 chaeta absent on Tht. II and III, m row chaetae present on Abdt. IV, tibiotarsi I-III with 18, 18, 17 chaetae respectively), but are distinguished by the number of chaetae on Tht. I (4+4 in P. dubius, 3+3 in P. vitalii and P. hyrcanicus sp. nov.) and Abdt. IV (11+11 in P. dubius and P. hyrcanicus sp.nov. and 14(15) + 14 in P. vitalii), number of teeth at mandible (two in P. dubius and P. vitalii and four in P. hyrcanicus sp.nov.) and claw (lateral teeth present in P. dubius and P. vitalii and absent in P. hyrcanicus sp.nov.). Pseudachorutes kurdistanicus sp. nov. is related to P. laricis Arbea Jordana,1989 and P. vasylii Kaprus Weiner, 2009 because of the same type of chaetotaxy of head (d1 chaetae present and a0 chaeta absent), Tht. I (3+3 chaetae), Tht. II-III (without a2 chaeta), Abdt. IV (m row chaetae absent), Abdt. V (a2 and p2 chaetae absent) and the absence of lateral teeth on claws. The last three species differ in number of vesicles in PAO (1112 in P. kurdistanicus sp. nov., 46 in P. vasylii and 7-97-9 in P. laricis), shape of apical vesicle on Ant. IV. (trilobed in P. kurdistanicus sp. nov. and simple or slightly bilobed in the other two species), labral formula (4/2,3,4 in a new species, 2/2,3,3,4 in P. laricis and 2/3,3,4 in P. vasylii) and number of chaetae on tibiotarsi I-III (18, 18, 17 in a new species and 19, 19, 18 in the other two species). An identification key of the species of Pseudachorutes recorded so far from Iran is given.",

        "Abstract": "Timing bone fractures is one of the main tasks of a forensic anthropologist, but still an uncertain diagnostic. In the literature, there are many macroscopic methods to distinguish perimortem from postmortem fractures, based on the distinct structural and mechanical properties of fresh and dry bones. However, this differentiation is still challenging, in particular when the bones are fragmented or still exhibit fresh properties. Although histologic analysis is often used as a complementary diagnostic tool in forensic pathology, its application in the evaluation of bone fractures is uncommon. The aim of this study was to investigate whether fractures of fresh bones reveal a distinct microcracking pattern compared to fractures of dry bones, in order to optimise the fracture timing. To this purpose, we histologically analysed perimortem and postmortem fractures in human humeri. The fresh bones were retrieved from traumatic autopsy cases, and the dry bones from donors which were experimentally fractured. Our results showed that the highest density and length of microcracks (MCKs) were found in the interstitial area of dry fractured bones, which may be considered a marker of postmortem damage. In fresh fractured bones, we generally observed a lower density of MCKs, but a higher proportion of osteonal MCKs, which may be considered a marker of perimortem trauma. In summary, the results of our exploratory study suggest that changes in intrinsic bone factors (mineral/organic components) result in a different microcracking pattern that can be used in fracture timing.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammations of the facial part of the skull are most commonly caused by a bacterial infection. They are a frequently occurring pathological process, which results from a rich bacterial flora of the oral cavity, as well as diseased teeth and periodontal tissues. These inflammations have a primarily mixed character with the prevalence of anaerobic bacteria. Gangrene of the dental pulp is the most common odontogenic cause. In the case of inflammations of oral tissues an early and corrective treatment results in quick recovery. The purpose of this work was to assess the efficiency of empirical antibiotic therapy applied in patients with inflammations of oral tissues on the basis of a drug susceptibility profile of bacteria isolated from material extracted from inflammatory lesions. The research material consisted of smears collected from patients with existing acute inflammations in the oral cavity. The smear was collected from the bottom of the lesion after its prior surgical treatment and pus evacuation, and again, 7 days after surgery. In patients with acute odontogenic inflammations the recommended first-line therapy are extended-spectrum penicillins, characterized by a low risk of side effects and strong antimicrobial activity. In the study group, both clindamycin and amoxicillin exhibited high efficiency in treating acute odontogenic inflammatory lesions in the oral cavity.",

        "Abstract": "Ancient written sources show that Roman funerary rituals were relevant along the entire Roman Republic and Empire, as they ensured the protection of deities and the memory of the deceased. Part of these rituals consisted of funerary offerings and banquets that were held on the day of the burial, in festivities and other stipulated days. The faunal remains recovered inside the graves and around them are evidence of these rituals. Therefore, their study can allow us to know if the funerary meals and rituals developed in the Roman necropolis were special and implied food that differed from everyday dietary habits, according to the importance of these rituals. To test this, we analysed the archaeozoological and anthropological material from the necropolis of Vila de Madrid (Barcelona, Catalonia), which was in use between the first half of the 2nd century AD and mid 3rd century AD. The archaeozoological analysis of the faunal remains recovered in the necropolis and inside the graves, as well as carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios results on bone collagen from 50 faunal specimens and 41 humans, suggest that, overall, funerary meals in Vila de Madrid necropolis did not imply different food than that consumed during life. Regarding age, sex, offerings and diet, some differences are observed, suggesting that inequalities present in life could have been also present in the funerary rituals.",

        "Abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common virus worldwide that is an etiologic agent in the development of many diseases, including cancer. Recent reports have shown the association of EBV with tumorigenesis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Moreover, EBV has been reported to be present in tonsillar tissues, which suggests a close relationship between viral infections and tonsillar diseases, including chronic tonsillitis. The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence of EBV DNA in 86 patients with HNSCC, in 70 patients with chronic tonsillitis, and in 144 healthy individuals (control group) and the associations between EBV infection and clinicopathological and demographic characteristics and the use of stimulants in all study groups. The objective of this study was also to analyze the prevalence of coinfection with human papillomavirus (HPV). After prior DNA isolation, EBV detection was performed using an EBV kit by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The prevalence of EBV infection in patients with HNSCC, patients with chronic tonsillitis, and the control group was 47.7%, 60%, and 24.3%, respectively. Compared to controls, a significantly higher prevalence of EBV in patients with chronic tonsillitis and HNSCC may suggest that EBV is a potential risk factor. No association was found between EBV infection and demographic or clinical data. Further studies are warranted due to inconclusive reports that were mainly related to geographic distribution, sample type, and detection technique. Considering the prevalence of the virus and the risk of serious diseases, attention should be paid to screening diagnosis and prevention of the infection.",

        "Abstract": "There is considerable evidence for the importance of the DNA methylome in metabolic health, for example, a robust methylation signature has been associated with body mass index (BMI). However, visceral fat (VF) mass accumulation is a greater risk factor for metabolic disease than BMI alone. In this study, we dissect the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) methylome signature relevant to metabolic health by focusing on VF as the major risk factor of metabolic disease. We integrate results with genetic, blood methylation, SAT gene expression, blood metabolomic, dietary intake and metabolic phenotype data to assess and quantify genetic and environmental drivers of the identified signals, as well as their potential functional roles.",

        "Abstract": "The development of cardiovascular diseases is undoubtedly influenced by improper dietary behavior. The most common mistakes include irregularity of meal consumption, high dietary atherogenicity: snacking on sweets between meals, low supply of dietary fiber, unsaturated fatty acids, legume seeds, and high supply of meat and meat products. Among many food components, some are characterized by a specific cardioprotective effect, which means that their supply of food may prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular disease or improve the health of the sick. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is one of the ingredients showing cardioprotective effects on the heart and blood vessels. Antioxidant and lipid profile-enhancing effects are also attributed to sitosterol which is one of the plant-derived sterols. A very important argument indicating the necessity of a varied diet rich in a variety of plant products is the beneficial effect of polyphenols, which are most abundant in multicolored vegetables and fruits. Numerous studies show their effectiveness in lowering blood pressure, improving lipid profile, and regeneration of vascular endothelium. The collected publications from the field of lifestyle medicine can be a source of knowledge for dieticians, physicians, and people associated with physical culture and human mental health to prevent the development of cardiovascular diseases and reduce the risk of death from this cause.",

        "Title": "Geographical contrasts of Y-chromosomal haplogroups from wild and domestic goats reveal ancient migrations and recent introgressions.",
        "Abstract": "By their paternal transmission, Y-chromosomal haplotypes are sensitive markers of population history and male-mediated introgression. Previous studies identified biallelic single-nucleotide variants in the SRY, ZFY and DDX3Y genes, which in domestic goats identified four major Y-chromosomal haplotypes, Y1A, Y1B, Y2A and Y2B, with a marked geographical partitioning. Here, we extracted goat Y-chromosomal variants from whole-genome sequences of 386 domestic goats (75 breeds) and seven wild goat species, which were generated by the VarGoats goat genome project. Phylogenetic analyses indicated domestic haplogroups corresponding to Y1B, Y2A and Y2B, respectively, whereas Y1A is split into Y1AA and Y1AB. All five haplogroups were detected in 26 ancient DNA samples from southeast Europe or Asia. Haplotypes from present-day bezoars are not shared with domestic goats and are attached to deep nodes of the trees and networks. Haplogroup distributions for 186 domestic breeds indicate ancient paternal population bottlenecks and expansions during migrations into northern Europe, eastern and southern Asia, and Africa south of the Sahara. In addition, sharing of haplogroups indicates male-mediated introgressions, most notably an early gene flow from Asian goats into Madagascar and the crossbreeding that in the 19th century resulted in the popular Boer and Anglo-Nubian breeds. More recent introgressions are those from European goats into the native Korean goat population and from Boer goat into Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi and Zimbabwe. This study illustrates the power of the Y-chromosomal variants for reconstructing the history of domestic species with a wide geographical range.",

        "Abstract": "Baby-led weaning (BLW) is an increasingly popular way of expanding a baby's diet. It is based on the baby becoming physically ready to feed himself, effectively supplementing his diet, which until now has been based on breast milk or modified milk. The aim of the study was to assess mothers' knowledge about the use of the BLW method to expand the diet of a young child. The essence of the study assumed the analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of using this method indicated by mothers.",

In this short review, we discuss approaches to treat COVID-19 that are based on current knowledge of the mechanisms of viral cell receptor recognition, virus-host membrane fusion, and inhibition of viral RNA and viral assembly. Despite enormous progress in antiviral therapy and prevention, new effective therapies are still in great demand.",

Patients with Cystic Fibrosis, oral bacteria related to dental and periodontal diseases that can also inhabit the lungs, increases the risk for systemic complications. Our study aimed at assessing oral hygiene status of cystic fibrosis adult patients. The study was conducted on 40 patients diagnosed with CF and 40 healthy participants. The following indices were included: Simplified Oral Hygiene (OHI-S), Approximal Plaque Index (API), Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs (CPITN), and a questionnaire. Obtained results proved that the API was 44.63% in the study group, indicating sufficient hygiene, and 37% in the control group, indicating quite good hygiene. Significantly higher OHI-S was found in the study group. It was found based on the analysis of treatment needs that home care and professional instructions on proper oral hygiene were more often needed in the control group compared to CF patients. In conclusion, the obtained API and OHI-S values in adult CF patients were indicative of satisfactory oral hygiene. Periodontal treatment needs assessed based on the CPITN index in patients with CF indicated the need for professional preventive treatments. An interdisciplinary dental care to support oral health could be recommendable in individuals with chronic respiratory diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis.",

        "Abstract": "Flow cytometry technique (FC) is a standard diagnostic tool for diagnostics of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) assessing the immunophenotype of blast cells. BCP-ALL is often associated with underlying genetic aberrations, that have evidenced prognostic significance and can impact the disease outcome. Since the determination of patient prognosis is already important at the initial phase of BCP-ALL diagnostics, we aimed to reveal specific genetic aberrations by finding specific multiple antigen expression patterns with FC immunophenotyping. The FC immunophenotype data were analysed using machine learning methods (gradient boosting, decision trees, classification rules). The obtained results were verified with the use of repeated cross-validation. The t(12;21)/ETV6-RUNX1 aberration occurs more often when blasts present high expression of CD10, CD38, low CD34, CD45 and specific low expression of CD81. The t(v;11q23)/KMT2A is associated with positive NG2 expression and low CD10, CD34, TdT and CD24. Hyperdiploidy is associated with CD123, CD66c and CD34 expression on blast cells. In turn, high expression of CD81, low expression of CD45, CD22 and lack of CD123 and NG2 indicates that none of the studied aberrations is present. Detecting aberrations in pediatric BCP-ALL, based on the expression of multiple markers, can be done with decent efficiency.",

This disorder continues to pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for many professionals. This disorder can affect people of all ages. The most characteristic pattern is considered to be a lack of interest in eating or avoidance of food intake, which may result in nutritional deficiencies, weight loss or lack of expected weight gain, dependence on enteral feeding or dietary supplements, and impaired psychosocial functioning. This disorder cannot be explained by a current medical condition or co-occurring other psychiatric disorders, but if ARFID co-occurs with another disorder or illness, it necessarily requires extended diagnosis. Its treatment depends on the severity of the nutritional problem and may include hospitalization with multispecialty care (pediatrician, nutritionist, psychologist, psychiatrist, neurologist). The nutritional management strategy may include, inter alia, the use of Food Chaining, and should in the initial stage of therapy be based on products considered \"safe\" in the patient's assessment. The role of the dietitian in the management of a patient with ARFID is to monitor weight and height and nutritional status and analyze the foods that should be introduced into the food chain first.",

        "Abstract": "The ability to treat severe viral infections is limited by our understanding of the mechanisms behind virus-induced immunopathology. While the role of type I interferons (IFNs) in early control of viral replication is clear, less is known about how IFNs can regulate the development of immunopathology and affect disease outcomes. Here, we report that absence of type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) is associated with extensive immunopathology following mucosal viral infection. This pathology occurred independent of viral load or type II immunity but required the presence of macrophages and IL-6. The depletion of macrophages and inhibition of IL-6 signaling significantly abrogated immunopathology. Tissue destruction was mediated by macrophage-derived matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), as MMP inhibition by doxycycline and Ro 28-2653 reduced the severity of tissue pathology. Analysis of post-mortem COVID-19 patient lungs also displayed significant upregulation of the expression of MMPs and accumulation of macrophages. Overall, we demonstrate that IFNs inhibit macrophage-mediated MMP production to prevent virus-induced immunopathology and uncover MMPs as a therapeutic target towards viral infections.",

        "Title": "Explicit and Implicit Gender-Related Stereotyping in Transgender, Gender Expansive, and Cisgender Adults.",
        "Abstract": "Little is known about gender-related stereotyping among transgender and gender expansive adults. Using the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (AIS; Glick & Fiske, 1996), we examined explicit gender attitudes in 3298 cisgender, transgender, and gender expansive respondents designated female at birth (FAB; n\u2009=\u20091976 cisgender, n\u2009=\u2009108 transgender, n\u2009=\u2009188 gender expansive) and male at birth (MAB; n\u2009=\u2009922 cisgender, n\u2009=\u200952 transgender, n\u2009=\u200952 gender expansive). In order to learn more about implicit gender-related stereotyping, a subset of 822 participants (FAB; n\u2009=\u2009445 cisgender, n\u2009=\u200932 transgender, n\u2009=\u200951 gender expansive. MAB; n\u2009=\u2009254 cisgender, n\u2009=\u200921 transgender, n\u2009=\u200919 gender expansive) completed the gender-leadership Implicit Association Test (IAT; Dasgupta & Asgari, 2004). Cisgender men scored significantly higher than all other groups on hostile sexism, but patterns of endorsement for benevolent sexism and implicit attitudes were more nuanced, with cisgender women and gender expansive FAB often scoring significantly below other groups. We observed that transgender men and transgender women, along with cisgender men and gender expansive MAB, moderately endorsed essentialist views regarding differences between men and women (i.e., complementary gender differentiation). These data reveal novel patterns of gender-related stereotyping, with some corresponding to sex designated at birth and others corresponding to current gender identification. Together, these findings suggest that one's experienced gender, designated sex at birth, and the intersection between them may relate to gender stereotyping, underscoring the importance of including transgender and gender expansive individuals in this research.",

        "Abstract": "(1) Background: Thermal treatment of high-protein food may lead to the formation of mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds, e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic amines. Frequent consumption of processed meat was classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as directly carcinogenic for humans. (2) Methods: A literature review was carried out based on a search of online databases for articles on consuming thermally processed meat containing carcinogenic compounds versus a risk of cancers in humans published between 2001 and 2021. (3) Results: A review of the current literature on the participation of PAHs and HAA in the formation of certain neoplasms indicates a positive relationship between diet and the incidences of many cancers, especially colon cancer. A simple way to obtain dishes with reduced contents of harmful compounds is the use of spices and vegetables as meat additives. These seasonings are usually rich in antioxidants that influence the mechanism of HAA and PAH synthesis in food. (4) Conclusions: As there is a growing risk of a cancer tendency because of exposing humans to PAHs and HAAs, it is extremely vital to find a simple way to limit carcinogenic compound synthesis in a processed proteinaceous food. Disseminating the knowledge about the conditions for preparing dishes with a reduced content of carcinogenic compounds could become a vital element of cancer prevention programs.",

        "Abstract": "Food neophobia is the tendency to reject or be reluctant to try new and unfamiliar foods. Due to the period of its occurrence, which falls in the years of early childhood, it can significantly affect the child's food choices, shape taste preferences, and significantly influence the quality of the child's diet. The neophobic attitude has an important evolutionary significance because it protects the individual from ingesting potentially dangerous substances. On the other hand, it fosters avoidance behaviors that can also relate to the beneficial aspects of obtaining and consuming food. Currently, the strong emphasis placed on food safety means that neophobia may be less adaptive; nevertheless, a conservative attitude toward new foods still prevails. There is a strong association between food neophobia and the diversity of a person's diet and previous exposure to different foods. This review describes behaviors associated with food neophobia and analyzes other feeding and eating difficulties in children that should be differentiated from food neophobia. Management approaches affecting the reduction in food neophobia in children through various dietary and psychological interventions are also proposed.",

        "Abstract": "The survival of erythrocytes in the circulating blood depends on their membranes' structural and functional integrity. One of the mechanisms that may underlie the process of joint degeneration is the imbalance of prooxidants and antioxidants, promoting cellular oxidative stress. The study is aimed at observing the effects of the 21-day general rehabilitation program on the erythrocytes redox status and serum ST2 marker in patients after knee or hip replacement in the course of osteoarthritis. Erythrocytes and serum samples were collected from 36 patients. We analyzed the selected markers of the antioxidant system in the erythrocytes: catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (glutathione disulfide reductase (GR, GSR)), total superoxide dismutase activity (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione transferase (GST) activity, and cholesterol and lipofuscin (LPS) concentration. In serum, we analyzed the concentration of the suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) marker. After the 21-day general rehabilitation program, the total SOD and GPx activity, measured in the hemolysates, significantly increased (",

Here we describe Dicranocentrus dolosus sp. nov. from Cocos and Keeling Islands, the first species of the genus to be recorded from Australia. The new species is similar to D.inermodentes (Uchida, 1944) and D.indicus Bonet, 1930, but differs from both by the combination of the ventral head, mesothoracic and dental chaetotaxy. We also revisit Australotomurus based on previous studies to better interpret the dorsal macrochaetotaxy of the genus, and provide a synthetic map of chaetae to guide future studies on scaleless Orchesellidae. Finally, we present updated diagnoses to all genera and species of Australian Orchesellidae, as well as an identification key to all species.",

        "Title": "The Road Toward Transformative Treatments for Food Allergy.",
        "Abstract": "A series of landmark studies have provided conclusive evidence that the early administration of food allergens dramatically prevents the emergence of food allergy. One of the greatest remaining challenges is whether patients with established food allergy can return to health. This challenge is particularly pressing in the case of allergies against peanut, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish which are lifelong in most patients and may elicit severe reactions. The standard of care for food allergy is allergen avoidance and the timely administration of epinephrine upon accidental exposure. Epinephrine, and other therapeutic options like antihistamines provide acute symptom relief but do not target the underlying pathology of the disease. In principle, any transformative treatment for established food allergy would require the restoration of a homeostatic immunological state. This may be attained through either an active, non-harmful immune response (immunological tolerance) or a lack of a harmful immune response (e.g., anergy), such that subsequent exposures to the allergen do not elicit a clinical reaction. Importantly, such a state must persist beyond the course of the treatment and exert its protective effects permanently. In this review, we will discuss the immunological mechanisms that maintain lifelong food allergies and are, consequently, those which must be dismantled or reprogrammed to instate a clinically non-reactive state. Arguably, the restoration of such a state in the context of an established food allergy would require a reprogramming of the immune response against a given food allergen. We will discuss existing and experimental therapeutic strategies to eliminate IgE reactivity and, lastly, will propose outstanding questions to pave the road to the development of novel, transformative therapeutics in food allergy.",

        "Abstract": "Electrical storm (ES) is a life-threatening condition that may lead to recurrent arrhythmias, need for ventricular mechanical support, and death. The study aimed to assess the burden of arrhythmia recurrence and in-hospital outcomes of patients admitted for ES in a large urban hospital. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients admitted with ventricular arrhythmias from January 2018 to June 2021 and identified 61 patients with ES, defined as 3 or more episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) within 24\u00a0hours. We reviewed the in-hospital outcomes and compared outcomes between patients who had no recurrence of VT/VF after the first 24\u00a0hours (34 [56%]), those with recurrence of 1 or 2 episodes of VT/VF within a 24-hour period (15 [24%]), and patients with 3 or more recurrent VT/VF events consistent with recurrent ES after the first 24\u00a0hours (12 [20%]). Patients with recurrent ES had significantly higher in-hospital mortality as compared with those with recurrent VT/VF not meeting criteria for ES or no recurrences of VT/VF (3 [25%] vs 0 [0%] vs 0 [0%]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Moreover, patients with recurrent ES also had higher rates of the combined end points of ventricular mechanical support and death (7 [58%] vs 1 [6%] vs 1 [3%], p\u00a0<0.001), invasive mechanical ventilation and death (10 [83%] vs 2 [13%] vs 2 [6%], p\u00a0<0.001), catheter ablation or death (12 [100%] vs 7 [47%] vs 12 [35%], p\u00a0<0.001) and heart transplantation and death (3 [25%] vs 2 [13%] vs 0 [0%], p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). In conclusion, patients admitted with ES have a high risk of in-hospital recurrence, associated with extremely poor outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Quantifying total well loss through well screens has been traditionally undertaken through experimentally based empirical equations or equations derived for water flow through (circular) orifices. Advances in computer capacity enables incorporation of CFD formulations at millimeter scale, coupling Darcy flow and Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) to better understand and quantify processes related to well loss for different screen types. This study provides a methodology of quantifying well screen head loss using numerical models, coupling Darcy flow (aquifer and filter/gravel pack) with turbulent flow (in-well and through screen) at a sub-millimeter scale. Results are used to compare performance of four different types of well screens (Louver, slotted, bridge and wire wrap) and their overall impact and contribution to total well head loss for different slot apertures, pumping rates and hydraulic conductivity of the filter/gravel pack providing a new empirical formulation to quantify screen head loss.",

        "Abstract": "The emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) threaten the effectiveness of current COVID-19 vaccines administered intramuscularly and designed to only target the spike protein. There is a pressing need to develop next-generation vaccine strategies for broader and long-lasting protection. Using adenoviral vectors (Ad) of human and chimpanzee origin, we evaluated Ad-vectored trivalent COVID-19 vaccines expressing spike-1, nucleocapsid, and RdRp antigens in murine models. We show that single-dose intranasal immunization, particularly with chimpanzee Ad-vectored vaccine, is superior to intramuscular immunization in induction\u00a0of the tripartite protective immunity consisting of local and systemic antibody responses, mucosal tissue-resident memory T\u00a0cells and mucosal trained innate immunity. We further show that intranasal immunization provides protection against both the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and two VOC, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Our findings indicate that respiratory mucosal delivery of Ad-vectored multivalent vaccine represents an effective next-generation COVID-19 vaccine strategy to induce all-around mucosal immunity against current and future VOC.",

Furthermore, the first observational studies indicated that adjunct therapy with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was associated with lower mortality in this cohort of patients. However, the timing of starting LMWH and the dose remain controversial in COVID-19 patients. Considering the above, the aim of this study was to reveal the rationale for using LMWH in the therapy of symptomatic COVID-19 patients based on experimental and clinical studies on LMWH in inflammatory settings with special consideration given to randomized trials.",

        "Abstract": "Accurate blood pressure measurement is crucial for proper screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of high blood pressure. However, providers are not aware of proper blood pressure measurement skills, do not master all the appropriate skills, or miss key steps in the process, leading to inconsistent or inaccurate readings. Training in blood pressure measurement for most providers is usually limited to a one-time brief demonstration during professional education coursework. The American Medical Association and the American Heart Association developed a 30-minute e-Learning module designed to refresh and improve existing blood pressure measurement knowledge and clinical skills among practicing providers. One hundred seventy-seven practicing providers, which included medical assistants, nurses, advanced practice providers, and physicians, participated in a multi-site randomized educational study designed to assess the effect of this e-Learning module on blood pressure measurement knowledge and skills. Participants were randomized 1:1 to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group followed a pre-post assessment approach, and the control group followed a test-retest approach. The initial assessment showed that participants in both the intervention and control groups correctly performed less than half of the 14 skills considered necessary to obtain an accurate blood pressure measurement (mean scores 5.5 and 5.9, respectively). Following the e-Learning module, the intervention group performed on average of 3.4 more skills correctly vs 1.4 in the control group (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). Our findings reinforce existing evidence that errors in provider blood pressure measurements are highly prevalent and provide novel evidence that refresher training improves measurement accuracy.",

        "Abstract": "After death human body is subject to the processes of autolysis and putrefaction. Notably, the changes in cadaver during decomposition complicate its forensic analysis and particularly the estimation of the post-mortem interval (PMI). The process and rate of decomposition is impacted by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors that vary across countries and regions. Studying the decomposition pattern in different regions in the world helps us to understand the process and improve the precision of the PMI estimation of decomposed bodies. With the aim to develop a taphonomic model of decomposition in the province of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain), this study analyses the influence of several intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the pattern and rate of decomposition in this geographical area. Our statistical model concluded that the most significant factors affecting the decomposition pattern and rate are temperature and PMI. Nevertheless, there are other intrinsic factors such as cause, manner of death and underlying pathological conditions which also have an important role. Moreover, considering the various variables studied in this research, two predictive machine learning algorithms were developed as a probabilistic approach to estimate the PMI. Reliable classification results are obtained for three interval groups (1-2\u00a0days, 3-10\u00a0days, and\u00a0>\u00a010\u00a0days) and two interval groups (>1 week, < 1\u00a0week). Machine learning algorithm is a promising tool to gain objectivity in forensic PMI assessments. The results of this study could potentially assist further research in forensic taphonomy.",

        "Title": "\"Obesity and Insulin Resistance\" Is the Component of the Metabolic Syndrome Most Strongly Associated with Oxidative Stress.",
        "Abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MS) is not a homogeneous entity, but this term refers to the coexistence of factors that increase the risk for the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There are different versions of the criteria for the diagnosis of MS, which makes the population of patients diagnosed with MS heterogeneous. Research to date shows that MS is associated with oxidative stress (OS), but it is unclear which MS component is most strongly associated with OS. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationship between the parameters of OS and the presence of individual elements of MS in young adults, as well as to identify the components of MS by means of principal components analysis (PCA) and to investigate how the parameters of OS correlate with the presence of individual components. The study included 724 young adults with or without a family history of coronary heart disease (population of the MAGNETIC study). Blood samples were taken from the participants of the study to determine peripheral blood counts, biochemical parameters, and selected parameters of OS. In addition, blood pressure and anthropometric parameters were measured. In subjects with MS, significantly lower activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), copper- and zinc-containing SOD (CuZnSOD), and manganese-containing SOD (MnSOD) were found, along with significantly higher total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and significantly lower concentration of thiol groups per gram of protein (PSH). We identified three components of MS by means of PCA: \"Obesity and insulin resistance\", \"Dyslipidemia\", and \"Blood pressure\", and showed the component \"Obesity and insulin resistance\" to have the strongest relationship with OS. In conclusion, we documented significant differences in some parameters of OS between young adults with and without MS. We showed that \"Obesity and insulin resistance\" is the most important component of MS in terms of relationship with OS.",

The \"72-hour rule\" allows non-OTP providers to administer methadone for emergency opioid withdrawal management while arranging ongoing care. Low-barrier substance use disorder (SUD) bridge clinics provide rapid access to buprenorphine but offer an opportunity to treat acute opioid withdrawal while facilitating OTP linkage.

        "Abstract": "Adipose tissue secretes many regulatory factors called adipokines. Adipokines affect the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates. They also influence the regulation of the immune system and inflammation. The current study aimed to evaluate the association between markers related to obesity, diabesity and adipokines and metabolically healthy and unhealthy obesity in young men. The study included 98 healthy participants. We divided participants into three subgroups based on body mass index and metabolic health definition: 49 metabolically healthy normal-weight patients, 27 metabolically healthy obese patients and 22 metabolically unhealthy obese patients. The 14 metabolic markers selected were measured in serum or plasma. The analysis showed associations between markers related to obesity, diabesity and adipokines in metabolically healthy and unhealthy obese participants. The decreased level of adipsin (",

        "Title": "The Prevalence of High- and Low-Risk Types of HPV in Patients with Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck, Patients with Chronic Tonsillitis, and Healthy Individuals Living in Poland.",
        "Abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a virus with the potential to infect human epithelial cells and an etiological agent of many types of cancer, including head and neck cancer. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of HPV infection in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), patients with chronic tonsillitis, and healthy individuals, and to establish high- and low-risk HPV genotypes in these groups. The objectives also comprised the delineation of the relationship between the infection with high- or low-risk HPV subtypes and clinicopathological and demographic characteristics of the study groups. This study was composed of 76 patients diagnosed with HNSCC, 71 patients with chronic tonsillitis, and 168 cases without either of these conditions (the control group). HPV detection and identification of subtypes were performed on isolated DNA using a test which allowed detection of 33 common high-risk and low-risk HPV subtypes. The prevalence of HPV infection was 42.1%, 25.4%, and 37.5% in HNSCC, chronic tonsillitis, and control groups, respectively. HPV 16 was the most prevalent genotype in all groups and the non-oncogenic HPV 43/44 was frequent in HNSCC patients. This analysis provides insight into the prevalence of oral oncogenic and non-oncogenic HPVs in patients with head and neck cancer, patients with chronic tonsillitis and healthy individuals, and leads to the conclusion that further investigations are warranted to examine a larger cohort of patients focusing on high- and low-risk HPV genotypes. Efforts should be focused on screening and prevention strategies, and therefore, it is important to introduce tools for effective detection of HPV genotypes. Furthermore, given the role of vaccines against oral HPV infection, our observations lead to the suggestion that HPV vaccination should be of considerable importance in public health strategies.",

        "Title": "Pathogenesis and Clinical Significance of In-Stent Restenosis in Patients with Diabetes.",
        "Abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a strong risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In the population of people living with DM, PAD is characterised by multi-level atherosclerotic lesions as well as greater involvement of the arteries below the knee. DM is also a factor that significantly increases the risk of lower limb amputation. Percutaneous balloon angioplasty with or without stent implantation is an important method of the treatment for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, but restenosis is a factor limiting its long-term effectiveness. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in the course of DM differs slightly from that in the general population. In the population of people living with DM, more attention is drawn to such factors as inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, platelet dysfunction, blood rheological properties, hypercoagulability, and additional factors stimulating vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. DM is a risk factor for restenosis. The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the literature and to present the most important information on the current state of knowledge on mechanisms and the clinical significance of restenosis and in-stent restenosis in patients with DM, especially in association with the endovascular treatment of PAD. The role of such processes as inflammation, neointimal hyperplasia and neoatherosclerosis, allergy, resistance to antimitotic drugs used for coating stents and balloons, genetic factors, and technical and mechanical factors are discussed. The information on restenosis collected in this publication may be helpful in planning further research in this field, which may contribute to the formulation of more and more precise recommendations for the clinical practice.",

        "Abstract": "PiRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs that, in their mature form, bind to Piwi proteins to repress transposable element activity. Besides their role in gametogenesis and genome integrity, recent evidence indicates their action in non-germinative tissues. We performed a global analysis of piRNA and Piwi gene expression in the skeletal muscle of juveniles pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus), tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), and the hybrid tambacu to evaluate the degree of piRNA sharing among these three genotypes. Total RNA was sequenced and analyzed using specific parameters of piRNAs by bioinformatics tools. piRNA and Piwi gene expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR. We detected 24 piRNA clusters common to the three genotypes, with eight shared between pacu and tambacu, three between pacu and tambaqui, and five between tambaqui and tambacu; seven, five, and four clusters were unique to pacu, tambacu, and tambaqui, respectively. Genomic localization and fold change values showed two clusters and 100 piRNAs shared among the three genotypes. The gene expression of four piRNAs was evaluated to validate our bioinformatics results. piRNAs from cluster 17 were higher in tambacu than pacu and piRNAs from cluster 18 were more highly expressed in tambacu than tambaqui and pacu. In addition, the expression of Piwis 1 and 2 was higher in tambacu and tambaqui than pacu. Our results open an important window to investigate whether these small noncoding RNAs benefit the hybrid in terms of faster growth and offer a new perspective on the function of piRNAs and Piwis in fish skeletal muscle.",

        "Abstract": "Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world. The search for effective and minimally invasive methods of treating colon cancer is the aim of modern medicine. Chalcones and their derivatives have shown an anticancer activity. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of methoxy-derivatives of 2'-hydroxychalcones: 2'-hydroxy-3\"-methoxychalcone (TJ3), 2'-hydroxy-2\"-methoxychalcone (TJ6) and 2'-hydroxy-4\"-metoxychalcone (TJ7) at the concentrations of 10\u00a0\u00b5M and 25\u00a0\u00b5M on the release of IL-8, MIF, VCAM-1, ICAM-1 by colon cancer SW480 and SW620 cell lines. The cytokines and adhesion molecules were detected using the Bio-Plex Magnetic Luminex Assay and the Bio-Plex Suspension Array System. Our results showed that all tested methoxy-derivatives of 2'-hydroxychalcone compounds significantly reduced ICAM-1 released by SW480 cancer cells. The tested compounds at both concentrations did not significantly affect VCAM-1 released by SW480 and SW620 cancer cell lines. All methoxy-derivatives significantly reduced the concentration of MIF in dose dependent manner on SW480 cells. The TJ3 at the concentration of 25\u00a0\u00b5M significantly decreased IL-8 secreted by SW480 and SW620 cancer cells. Our results demonstrated that tested methoxy-derivatives of 2'-hydroxychalcones showed modulating effect on colon cancer cells.",

Cardiac sarcoidosis can lead to life threatening arrhythmias and heart failure. While corticosteroids have been used as a treatment for over 50\u00a0years, they are associated with hypertension, diabetes, and weight gain, further increasing cardiovascular risk. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is the prototypical proinflammatory cytokine that works to activate the nuclear transcription factor NF-kB, one of the targets of glucocorticoids. IL-1 also plays an important role also in the pathophysiology of heart disease including atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and myocarditis.",

        "Abstract": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a type of cardiovascular disease (CVD) that affects the coronary arteries, which provide oxygenated blood to the heart. It is a major cause of mortality worldwide. Various prediction methods have been developed to assess the likelihood of developing CHD, including those based on clinical features and genetic variation. Recent epigenome-wide studies have identified DNA methylation signatures associated with the development of CHD, indicating that DNA methylation may play a role in predicting future CHD. This narrative review summarises recent findings from DNA methylation studies of incident CHD (iCHD) events from epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs). The results suggest that DNA methylation signatures may identify new mechanisms involved in CHD progression and could prove a useful adjunct for the prediction of future CHD.",

        "Abstract": "One modern imaging technique used in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) is sonoelastrography of the intestine. Guidelines regarding the use of bowel sonoelastography in CD have still not been specified. The aim of our research was to conduct a systematic review of the use of sonoelastography in the diagnosis, assessment, and monitoring of strictures in the course of CD. A systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines statement. The following databases were searched in January 2021: MEDINE via PubMed, Embase and Scopus. The search utilised the following MeSH tags: 'Ultrasound Shear Wave', 'Elastography', 'elastogram', 'elastographies' AND 'Crohn disease'. The inclusion criteria were as follows: from 2010 or later, articles with abstracts, articles in English, human-based studies and original articles. Articles were assessed independently by two reviewers. Out of 181 articles, only 15 met the criteria and were included in the review. Due to a small number of studies and significant methodological differences, the feasibility of using sonoelastography for Crohn's disease must be proven through further research and analysis. In the future, standardised assessment criteria and cut-off points should be established for both strain elastography (SE) and shear wave elastography (SWE).",

Cross-sectional study with ELSA-Brasil data (2008-2010). A questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic, food, health data and anthropometry. Descriptive analysis and association with variables of interest were carried out. In the sample, 8% of the total caloric value comes from non-alcoholic beverages (5.6%: sugary drinks), and 4% from alcoholic beverages (2.7%: beer). Consumers of unsweetened and artificially sweetened beverages reported moderate/strong physical activity, former smokers and higher education. The opposite was true for sugary drinks. Eutrophic people reported higher consumption of sugary drinks and those obese, artificially sweetened and beer. Alcohol consumption varied with age (young: beer; elderly: wine/spirits) and education (low education: beer/spirits; higher education: wine). Coffee, natural juice and soda were the most consumed non-alcoholic beverages and beer was the most prevalent alcoholic beverage. Consumption variation was observed according to geographic location. The consumption of sugary and alcoholic beverages is high in Brazil and public health strategies are required.",

        "Abstract": "This research was designed to investigate changes that can arise in an invertebrate organism due to stress caused by a strong prooxidant, graphene oxide (GO), and a potent antioxidant, vitamin C. The study aimed to investigate if vitamin C may support convalescence after chronic GO intoxication. We investigated the toxicity of chronic dietary graphene oxide administration in house cricket (Acheta domesticus) types: wild and selected for longevity (with a better developed antioxidant system, conducive to long life). Vitamin C was applied immediately after cessation of graphene oxide intoxication to check if it can support the remedial effect. The condition of cells, DNA stability, catalase activity, and the reproduction potential, measured as the Vitellogenin (Vg) protein expression level, were investigated in control and GO treated groups, recovery groups (-GO), and recovery groups with Vit. C (-GO\u00a0+\u00a0Vit.C). In this study vitamin C had no evident remedial effect on the house crickets exposed to graphene oxide. Most probably, the mechanism of vitamin C action, in case of intoxication with nanoparticles, is much more complicated. In the context of the results obtained, it is worth considering whether Vit. C, applied after GO intoxication, causes further disturbance of homeostasis in terms of the cells' redox potential.",

        "Abstract": "In forensic toxicology, alternative biological materials are very useful and important, e.g. in the case of lack of basic body fluids. One alternative biological material is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The procedures of the collection of biological material during the autopsy are performed in accordance with local, usually national recommendations, which most often require updating. It is very difficult to assess the possibility of using CSF as an alternative biological material for toxicological studies for the presence of drugs, intoxicants, including new psychoactive substances (commonly known as designer drugs), psychotropic substances, and ethyl alcohol, based on current data. Previous research suggests that CSF may be useful in toxicological studies, but these aspects need to be investigated more carefully because studies have collected CSF from different sites and often the results of different authors are not comparable. It would be necessary to prepare guidelines, e.g. the site of CSF collection that may influence the results of quantitative analysis. It would also be necessary to replicate some studies with a different collection site or a more recent analytical technique, e.g. for comparative testing of blood ethanol and cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid can be a valuable information carrier in the absence of classic biological material from an autopsy. Investigating these aspects in more detail could allow the future use of this alternative material for routine toxicology analyzes in a forensic laboratory.",

Thus, analyzing total heavy metal content in soil and plants in this region is, while challenging, highly important in order to assess the level for determining the soil degradation level and the phytoremediation potential of naturally growing salt marsh species. This area together with a Bojana river and backshore forms a real vegetation mosaic where habitats of various types coexist. Therefore, it represents good model system. In the present study, the levels of As, Al, B, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb and Zn in coastal soils as well as in eight salt marsh plants: Bolboschoenus maritimus, Juncus acutus, Juncus anceps, Juncus articulatus, Juncus gerardii, Juncus maritimus, Scirpus holoschoenus and Schoenus nigricans, were investigated in order to identify the plant species that can be used for the remediation of polluted sites, especially those located along the coastline. The obtained results show that species J. gerardii, J. articulatus and B. maritimus can be clearly separated from J. acutus, J. anceps, J. maritimus, S. holoschoenus and Sh. nigricans based on the degree of heavy metal accumulation in various organs. Moreover, analyses revealed that the bioaccumulation factor of underground organs is significantly higher relative to that of the aboveground parts for almost all investigated metals and species. The bioaccumulation factor had the highest value in the underground organs of J. gerardii and B. maritimus, where a value of 3.37 was measured for B and 2.54 for Hg, respectively. Hence, as all investigated species are \"underground accumulators\" for most of the analyzed metals, they could be useful for phytostabilization and phytoremediation of B and Hg in particular. Moreover, each plant species can be used in the phytoremediation process targeting specific heavy metals.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of toothpaste containing natural tea tree essential oil (TTO) and ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP), on microflora and selected indicators of oral health in patients using removable acrylic partial dentures. Fifty patients with varying conditions of hygiene were divided into two groups. The study group received the toothpaste with TTO and EEP, while the control group received the same toothpaste but without TTO and EEP. At the first visit, oral hygiene and hygiene of the prostheses were carried out. Control visits took place 7 and 28 days later and compared to baseline. Indexes like API (Approximal Plaque Index), mSBI (modified Sulcus Bleeding Index), OHI-s (simplified Oral Hygiene Index), and DPI (Denture Plaque Index) were assessed in three subsequent stages, and swabs were collected from floor of the mouth area to assess the microbiota. After 7 and 28 days of using the toothpaste with TTO and EEP, a statistically significant decrease of the examined indicator values were observed in the study group as compared to the values upon the initial visit. The number of isolated strains of microorganisms in the study group was decreased or maintained at the same level, whereas in the control group an increase in the number of isolated strains was observed. The observed stabilization of oral microbiota in patients from the study group confirms the beneficial activity of toothpaste containing EEP and TTO compared to the control group.",

        "Abstract": "Environmental factors may negatively contribute to a progressive worsening of semen quality, and differences in semen quality may result from different environmental exposures (regional differences) or lifestyle differences. Heavy metals are factors with a confirmed negative influence on male fertility. Among them, lead and cadmium are commonly found in human surroundings. Thus, we analyzed semen parameters (according to the World Health Organization 2010 recommendations) and semen lead and cadmium concentrations in 188 men from two different regions in Poland, a typical agricultural area and an industrial area, in couples that had been diagnosed with infertility. The assays were performed using flameless electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. In the statistical analysis, regional comparisons and then taxonomic comparisons based on three parameters (age, semen concentration, and sperm morphology) were applied. We showed that more cadmium than lead accumulated in semen, a higher cadmium concentration was observed in semen obtained from men from the agricultural region, and better semen quality and lower cadmium concentrations were found in the semen of men from the industrial, more polluted region. We thus showed an existing regionalism in the sperm quality properties. However, semen parameters such as morphology and progressive and nonprogressive motility followed the same trends, regardless of the patient's age, region, or class. We could conclude that the environment has a minor impact on sperm morphology and progressive and nonprogressive motility and that other existing factors could have an indirect influence on semen quality.",

        "Abstract": "Artificial selection is one of the major forces modifying the genetic composition of livestock populations. Identifying genes under selection could be useful to elucidate their impact on phenotypic variation. We aimed to identify genomic regions targeted by selection for dairy and pigmentation traits in Murciano-Granadina goats. Performance of a selection scan based on the integrated haplotype score test in a population of 1183 Murciano-Granadina goats resulted in the identification of 77 candidate genomic regions/SNPs. The most significant selective sweeps mapped to chromosomes 1 (69.86\u00a0Mb), 4 (41.80-49.95\u00a0Mb), 11 (65.74\u00a0Mb), 12 (31.24 and 52.51\u00a0Mb), 17 (34.76-37.67\u00a0Mb), 22 (31.75\u00a0Mb), and 26 (26.69-31.05\u00a0Mb). By using previously generated RNA-Seq data, we built a catalogue of 6414 genes that are differentially expressed across goat lactation (i.e. 78\u00a0days post-partum, early lactation; 216\u00a0days post-partum, late lactation; 285\u00a0days post-partum, dry period). Interestingly, 183 of these genes mapped to selective sweeps and several of them display functions related with lipid, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism, insulin signaling, cell proliferation, as well as mammary development and involution. Of particular interest are the CSN3 and CSN1S2 genes, which encode two major milk proteins. Additionally, we found three pigmentation genes (GLI3, MC1R, and MITF) co-localizing with selective sweeps. Performance of a genome-wide association study and Sanger sequencing and TaqMan genotyping experiments revealed that the c.801C>G (p.Cys267Trp) polymorphism in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene is the main determinant of the black (GG or GC genotypes) and brown (CC genotypes) colorations of Murciano-Granadina goats.",

We describe the creation of an open science dataset from the PREVENT-AD (PResymptomatic EValuation of Experimental or Novel Treatments for AD) cohort, composed of cognitively unimpaired older individuals with a parental or multiple-sibling history of AD. From 2011 to 2017, 386 participants were enrolled (mean age 63\u00a0years old\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05) for sustained investigation among whom 349 have retrospectively agreed to share their data openly. Repositories are findable through the unified interface of the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform and contain up to five years of longitudinal imaging data, cerebral fluid biochemistry, neurosensory capacities, cognitive, genetic, and medical information. Imaging data can be accessed openly at https://openpreventad.loris.ca while most of the other information, sensitive by nature, is accessible by qualified researchers at https://registeredpreventad.loris.ca. In addition to being a living resource for continued data acquisition, PREVENT-AD offers opportunities to facilitate understanding of AD pathogenesis.",

        "Title": "Markers with low GenTrain scores can generate spurious signals in genome-wide scans for transmission ratio distortion.",
        "Abstract": "Transmission ratio distortion (TRD) is the preferential transmission of one specific allele to offspring at the expense of the other. The existence of TRD is mostly explained by the segregation of genetic variants with deleterious effects on the developmental processes that go from the formation of gametes to fecundation and birth. A few years ago, a statistical methodology was implemented in order to detect TRD signals on a genome-wide scale as a first step toward uncovering the biological basis of TRD and reproductive success in domestic species. In the current work, we have analyzed the impact of SNP calling quality on the detection of TRD signals in a population of Murciano-Granadina goats. Seventeen bucks and their offspring (N\u00a0=\u00a0288) were typed with the Goat SNP50 BeadChip, whereas the genotypes of the dams were lacking. Performance of a genome-wide scan revealed the existence of 36 SNPs showing significant evidence of TRD. When we calculated GenTrain scores for each of the SNPs, we observed that 25 SNPs showed scores below 0.8. The allele frequencies of these SNPs in the offspring were not correlated with the allele frequencies estimated in the dams with statistical methods, providing evidence that flawed SNP calling quality might lead to the detection of spurious TRD signals. We conclude that, when performing TRD scans, the GenTrain scores of markers should be taken into account to discriminate SNPs that are truly under TRD from those yielding spurious signals owing to technical problems.",

        "Abstract": "Safety of healthcare workers in hospitals is a major concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being exposed for several working hours per day to infected patients, nurses dealing with COVID-19 face several issues that lead to physical/psychological breakdown. This study focused on burnout and its associated factors in nurses working in an Italian University Hospital during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. We designed a web-based cross-sectional study addressed to nurses working at the University Hospital in Foggia, Italy. The online questionnaire was organized in sections aimed at collecting demographic and occupational variables, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OBI). Two hundred and ninety-three nurses agreed to participate. According to MBI, we reported moderate/high emotional exhaustion in 76.5%, depersonalization in 50.2%, and personal gratification in 54.6% of participants. COVID-19-related burnout measured by OBI resulted medium/high in 89.1% of participants. Among demographic and occupational factors, a multivariate regression analysis identified emotional support, consideration of leaving job, and workload as predictive of burnout in nurses. In conclusion, this study suggests that the improvement of employer and family support to nurses, as well as reduction of workload and job-related stress, would contribute to reducing burnout in nurses during COVID-19 pandemics.",

        "Abstract": "This study aims to illustrate the landscape of passing opportunities of a football team across a set of competitive matches. To do so positional data of 5 competitive matches was used to create polygons of pass availability. Passes were divided into three types depending on the hypothetical threat they may pose to the opposing defense (penetrative, support, and backwards passes). These categories were used to create three heatmaps per match. Moreover, the mean time of passing opportunities was calculated and compared across matches and for the three categories of passes. Due to the specificity of player's interactive behavior, results showed heatmaps with a variety of patterns. Specifically the fifth match was very dissimilar to the other four. However, characterizing a football match in terms of passing opportunities with a single heatmap dismisses the variety of dynamics that occur throughout a match. Therefore, three temporal heatmaps over windows of 10\u00a0min were presented highlighting on-going dynamical changes in pass availability. Results also display that penetrative passes were available over shorter periods of time than backward passes that were available shorter than support passes. The results highlight the sensibility of the model to different task constrains that emerge within football matches.",

(2) Methods: We evaluated the host serologic responses, measured with semi-quantitative ELISA tests (IgA, IgG, IgM abs) in sera of 90 individuals in Hospital no. 4 in Bytom, 84 HCWs in the University Hospital in Opole and 25 in a Miasteczko \u015al\u0105skie local surgery. All volunteers had negative RT-PCR test results or had not had the RT-PCR test performed within 30 days before sampling. The ELISA test was made at two different time points (July/August 2020) with a 2-weeks gap between blood collections to avoid the \"serological window\" period.

        "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer is the second and third most common cancer in females and males, respectively. The PD-L1/PD-1 immune checkpoint is an important source of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and is associated with IFN\u03b3. Recent studies have revealed that a significant number of tumor suppressive miRNAs can regulate the expression of PD-L1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The objective quantification of selected microRNAs using the miREIA method in CRC tissue was performed. We investigated the roles of miR-93-5p and miR-142-5p expression and the levels of IFN\u03b3 in regulating the expression of PD-L1 in tumor and margin tissues of CRC in relation to the histological grade, TNM classification, and tumor localization. 37 samples of tumor and margin tissues from CRC patients were evaluated. MiR-93-5p and miR-142-5p levels were measured by a method for quantitative measurement of human microRNA (miREIA). The concentrations of PD-L1 and IFN\u03b3 were determined by the ELISA kit. We found higher concentrations of miR-93-5p, PD-L1 and IFN\u03b3 in tumor samples compared to tumor margin samples. A significant correlation was found between PD-L1 and IFN\u03b3 in tumor and margin specimens; between miR-142-5p and miR-93-5p levels \u00a0in tumor and margin specimens. A higher level of miR-93-5p was found in tumor margin tissues on the left side of the colon. Patients with distant metastases were characterized by higher miR-93-5p concentration compared to patients without metastases. CRC is an important source of PD-L1, IFN\u03b3 and miR-93-5p expression. Understanding the mechanisms underlying intratumoral PD-L1 expression may open new opportunities for targeted immunotherapy for colorectal cancer.",

        "Abstract": "A 53-year-old man was admitted for recurrent syncope and found to have complete heart block (CHB). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging MRI) showed extensive patchy late gadolinium enhancement in the apical and lateral walls, consistent with cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) but no scar in the septum. A fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography showed FDG uptake in the septum and basal lateral walls. Imaging suggested active inflammation in the septum affecting atrioventricular (AV) conduction but no irreversible fibrosis. Diagnosis of isolated CS requires a high level of suspicion and multidisciplinary teamwork involving heart failure specialists, electrophysiologists and rheumatologists. After specialist and patient discussion, treatment of the disease was initiated with prednisone 40\u2009mg daily, 11 months after presenting with CHB. Three weeks later, ECG with pacing inhibited showed second-degree AV block Mobitz type II and 4 weeks later, AV conduction recovery. This highlights the importance of immediate therapy in reversing AV conduction abnormalities in CS.",

        "Title": "Self-medication among pregnant women attending outpatients' clinics in northern Jordan-a cross-sectional study.",
        "Abstract": "Self-medication can facilitate patients' access to medicinal products, save time, and reduce financial and health-care service use burden. On the other hand, irresponsible use of self-medications can result in adverse consequences. Self-medication is common among different demographic groups including pregnant women. In general, medicinal products might have harmful effects on mothers and baby. This study aimed to assess self-medication practices among pregnant women in the northern region of Jordan. A cross-sectional study was conducted on pregnant women attending outpatient clinics in the northern region of Jordan. Self-medication practices among the target population were assessed using a survey questionnaire that was administered through interviewer-assisted mode. Data were collected between December 2019 and September 2020, and descriptive statistics and inferential analysis were applied. A total of 1,313 pregnant women were surveyed (response rate\u00a0=\u00a095.50%). Self-medication and the use of herbal remedies were practiced by 33.10% and 32.14% of the participant, respectively. Headaches and general pains were the most frequently reported conditions treated by self-medication practice with either conventional medicinal products or herbal remedies. The gravidity (\u22654) and the gestational stage (\u226528\u00a0weeks) were the predictors of self-medication practice. This study showed that self-medication was not widely practiced by pregnant women in the northern region of Jordan. Disease simplicity and previous history were the main motives for self-medicating. Efforts should be made by health-care providers to address pregnant women and educate them to increase their awareness about the unsafe use of medicines and the harmful effects on fetus.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity is a significant factor related to metabolic disturbances that can lead to metabolic syndrome (MetS). Metabolic dysregulation causes oxidative stress, which affects telomere structure. The current study aimed to evaluate the relationships between telomere length, oxidative stress and the metabolically healthy and unhealthy phenotypes in healthy young men. Ninety-eight participants were included in the study (49 healthy slim and 49 obese patients). Study participants were divided into three subgroups according to body mass index and metabolic health. Selected oxidative stress markers were measured in serum. Relative telomere length (rTL) was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The analysis showed associations between laboratory markers, oxidative stress markers and rTL in metabolically healthy and unhealthy participants. Total oxidation status (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and rTL were significantly connected with metabolically unhealthy obesity. TAC was associated with metabolically healthy obesity. Telomeres shorten in patients with metabolic dysregulation related to oxidative stress and obesity linked to MetS. Further studies among young metabolically healthy and unhealthy individuals are needed to determine the pathways related to metabolic disturbances that cause oxidative stress that leads to MetS.",

        "Abstract": "As bioprocess intensification has increased over the last 30\u2009years, yields from mammalian cell processes have increased from 10's of milligrams to over 10's of grams per liter. Most of these gains in productivity can be attributed to increasing cell densities within bioreactors. As such, strategies have been developed to minimize accumulation of metabolic wastes, such as lactate and ammonia. Unfortunately, neither cell growth nor biopharmaceutical production can occur without some waste metabolite accumulation. Inevitably, metabolic waste accumulation leads to decline and termination of the culture. While it is understood that the accumulation of these unwanted compounds imparts a suboptimal culture environment, little is known about the genotoxic properties of these compounds that may lead to global genome instability. In this study, we examined the effects of high and moderate extracellular ammonia on the physiology and genomic integrity of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.",

In Spain, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a lockdown for almost 100 days and forced the sudden stop of sport practices and competitions. This interruption had a negative impact on high-level athletes' mental health. However, its impact on young athletes, who are intrinsically developing a high-demanding dual career, remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed at (1) describing and characterizing the general impact that COVID-19 lockdown had on Spanish young athletes' life-spheres and mental health, and (2) identifying different profiles of athletes regarding life-conditions and sport-related variables.

        "Abstract": "While type 2 immunity has been conventionally viewed as beneficial against helminths, venoms, and poisons, and harmful in allergy, contemporary research has uncovered its critical role in the maintenance of homeostasis. The initiation of a type 2 immune response involves an intricate crosstalk between structural and immune cells. Structural cells react to physical and chemical tissue perturbations by secreting alarmins, which signal the innate immune system to restore homeostasis. This pathway acts autonomously in the context of sterile injury and in the presence of foreign antigen initiates an adaptive Th2 response that is beneficial in the context of venoms, toxins, and helminths, but not food allergens. The investigation of the triggers and mechanisms underlying food allergic sensitization in humans is elusive because sensitization is a silent process. Therefore, the central construct driving food allergy modeling is based on introducing perturbations of tissue homeostasis along with an allergen which will result in an immunological and clinical phenotype that is consistent with that observed in humans. The collective evidence from multiple models has revealed the pre-eminent role of innate cells and molecules in the elicitation of allergic sensitization. We posit that, with the expanding use of technologies capable of producing formidable datasets, models of food allergy will continue to have an indispensable role to delineate mechanisms and establish causal relationships.",

        "Abstract": "The three-dimensional printing of scaffolds is an interesting alternative to the traditional techniques of periodontal regeneration. This technique uses computer assisted design and manufacturing after CT scan. After 3D modelling, individualized scaffolds are printed by extrusion, selective laser sintering, stereolithography, or powder bed inkjet printing. These scaffolds can be made of one or several materials such as natural polymers, synthetic polymers, or bioceramics. They can be monophasic or multiphasic and tend to recreate the architectural structure of the periodontal tissue. In order to enhance the bioactivity and have a higher regeneration, the scaffolds can be embedded with stem cells and/or growth factors. This new technique could enhance a complete periodontal regeneration. This review summarizes the application of 3D printed scaffolds in periodontal regeneration. The process, the materials and designs, the key advantages and prospects of 3D bioprinting are highlighted, providing new ideas for tissue regeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Current knowledge about the evolutionary history of donkeys is still incomplete due to the lack of archeological and whole-genome diversity data. To fill this gap, we have de novo assembled a chromosome-level reference genome of one male Dezhou donkey and analyzed the genomes of 126 domestic donkeys and seven wild asses. Population genomics analyses indicate that donkeys were domesticated in Africa and conclusively show reduced levels of Y chromosome variability and discordant paternal and maternal histories, possibly reflecting the consequences of reproductive management. We also investigate the genetic basis of coat color. While wild asses show diluted gray pigmentation (Dun phenotype), domestic donkeys display non-diluted black or chestnut coat colors (non-Dun) that were probably established during domestication. Here, we show that the non-Dun phenotype is caused by a 1\u2009bp deletion downstream of the TBX3 gene, which decreases the expression of this gene and its inhibitory effect on pigment deposition.",

        "Abstract": "Tissue engineering is a multidisciplinary field that relies on the development of customized biomaterial to support cell growth, differentiation and matrix production. Toward that goal, we designed the grafting of silane groups onto the chitosan backbone (Si-chito) for the preparation of in situ setting hydrogels in association with silanized hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Si-HPMC). Once functionalized, the chitosan was characterized, and the presence of silane groups and its ability to gel were demonstrated by rheology that strongly suggests the presence of silane groups. Throughout physicochemical investigations, the Si-HPMC hydrogels containing Si-chito were found to be stiffer with an injection force unmodified. The presence of chitosan within the hydrogel has demonstrated a higher adhesion of the hydrogel onto the surface of tissues. The results of cell viability assays indicated that there was no cytotoxicity of Si-chito hydrogels in 2D and 3D culture of human SW1353 cells and human adipose stromal cells, respectively. Moreover, Si-chito allows the transplantation of human nasal chondrocytes in the subcutis of nude mice while maintaining their viability and extracellular matrix secretory activity. To conclude, Si-chito mixed with Si-HPMC is an injectable, self-setting and cytocompatible hydrogel able to support the in vitro and in vivo viability and activity of hASC.",

        "Abstract": "The simulation of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems using fine-grained representations can become computationally prohibitive when particle numbers become large. If particle numbers are sufficiently high then it may be possible to ignore stochastic fluctuations and use a more efficient coarse-grained simulation approach. Nevertheless, for multiscale systems which exhibit significant spatial variation in concentration, a coarse-grained approach may not be appropriate throughout the simulation domain. Such scenarios suggest a hybrid paradigm in which a computationally cheap, coarse-grained model is coupled to a more expensive, but more detailed fine-grained model, enabling the accurate simulation of the fine-scale dynamics at a reasonable computational cost. In this paper, in order to couple two representations of reaction-diffusion at distinct spatial scales, we allow them to overlap in a 'blending region'. Both modelling paradigms provide a valid representation of the particle density in this region. From one end of the blending region to the other, control of the implementation of diffusion is passed from one modelling paradigm to another through the use of complementary 'blending functions' which scale up or down the contribution of each model to the overall diffusion. We establish the reliability of our novel hybrid paradigm by demonstrating its simulation on four exemplar reaction-diffusion scenarios.",

        "Abstract": "Morphological traits are of great importance to dairy goat production given their effect on phenotypes of economic interest. However, their underlying genomic architecture has not yet been extensively characterized. Herein, we aimed to identify genomic regions associated with body, udder, and leg conformation traits recorded in 825 Murciano-Granadina goats. We genotyped this resource population using the GoatSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) and performed genome-wide association analyses using the GEMMA software. We found 2 genome-wide significant associations between markers rs268273468 [Capra hircus (CHI) 16:69617700] and rs268249346 (CHI 28:18321523) and medial suspensory ligament. In contrast, we did not detect any genome-wide significant associations for body and leg traits. Moreover, we found 12, 19, and 7 chromosome-wide significant associations for udder, body, and leg traits, respectively. Comparison of our data with previous studies revealed a low level of positional concordance between regions associated with morphological traits. In addition to technical factors, this lack of concordance could be due to a substantial level of genetic heterogeneity among breeds or to the strong polygenic background of morphological traits, which makes it difficult to detect genetic factors that have small phenotypic effects.",

        "Abstract": "Imbalance in prooxidant-antioxidant equilibrium plays an important role in the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). Postoperative rehabilitation significantly improves the functional activity of patients with OA. We aimed to assess the effect of the general 21-day postoperative rehabilitation on the oxidative stress markers in patients after total hip arthroplasty or knee replacement. Patients (n\u2009=41) started individually designed postoperative rehabilitation ca. 90 days after endoprosthesis implantation. We used the six-minute walk test (6MWT) to quantify the changes in their exercise capacity. We analyzed the oxidative stress markers: total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total superoxide dismutase (SOD), Cu-Zn-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) and ceruloplasmin (Cp) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipofuscin (LPS) concentration in patients serum to asses changes in the oxidative stress intensity. We found that after 21-days postoperative rehabilitation program: the average distance walked by patients increased by 69\u2009m; TAC increased by 0.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14\u2009mmol/l; both SOD isoforms activities increased by 1.6 (\u00b11.7) and 1.72 (\u00b11.5) NU/ml, respectively; but Cp activity decreased by 1.8 (0.7-3.7) mg/dl. Also, we observed lower concentrations of lipid peroxidation markers: by 19.6\u2009\u00b1\u200924.4\u2009",

(2000), a dichotomous identification key, a table of characters and images of all nine known European magelonid species are provided. Magelona equilamellae is redescribed highlighting several features not reported originally by Harmelin. Notably the thoracic neuropodial lamellae, which are initially prechaetal but become distinctly postchaetal by chaetiger 7, an additional character allowing separation from the morphologically similar Magelona alleni. Records suggest that M. equilamellae is a Mediterranean species, more commonly occurring in shallow, transitional waters. Several new characters for Magelona filiformis are additionally highlighted as well as a number of corrections to the existing description, including the number of prostomial ridges, presence of abdominal lateral pouches, morphology of chaetiger 9, and the presence of smaller abdominal hooded hooks adjacent to lateral lamellae. The first image of M. filiformis minuta is provided, and its synonymy with M. filiformis further supported.",

        "Abstract": "Originally the genus Entomobrya (Collembola: Entomobryidae) comprised 25 species names in Australia including 7 subspecies of which 13 were exotic (50%) and the rest native. All native species had been either described by H. Sch\u00f6tt or H. Womersley and had not been examined since 1942. Specific characters they used were few, mainly colour pattern and gross morphological features such as unguis, unguis teeth and mucronal form. Chaetotaxic characters have now been developed. We now here recognise 47 species of Australian Entomobrya and Hymalanura based on a large collection made over 50 years. Six species (12%) are now recognised as introduced, 37 are new and three unresolved because of lack of specimens in good condition. Detailed descriptions and figures are supplied. Several new species are short-range endemics of conservation significance, others are specialised as to habitat, but most are widespread. Entomobrya is now the most species rich genus of Australian Collembola. A phylogenetic tree based on morphological and biological characters revealed clusters of exotic and montane habitat specialists, indicating that the genus is paraphyletic and so confirms other authors' work based on molecular characters. A key is supplied to Australian genera of Entomobryomorpha. A new genus record, Himalanura, is recognised extending its range to the Southern Hemisphere and 5,000 km further southeast.",

        "Abstract": "Age-at-death estimation methods are important in forensic anthropology. However, age assessment is problematic due to inter-individual variation. The subjectivity of visual scoring systems can affect the accuracy and reliability of methods as well. One of the most studied skeletal regions for age assessment is the pubic symphysis. Few studies on Spanish pubic symphysis collections have been conducted, making further research necessary as well as the sampling of more forensic skeletal collections. This study is a preliminary development of an age-at-death estimation method from the pubic symphysis based on a new simple scoring system. A documented late twentieth century skeletal collection (N\u2009=\u200929) and a twenty-first century forensic collection (N\u2009=\u200976) are used. Sixteen traits are evaluated, and a new trait (microgrooves) is described and evaluated for the first time in this study. All traits are scored in a binary manner (present or absent), thus reducing ambiguity and subjectivity. Several data sets are constructed based on different age intervals. Machine learning methods are employed to evaluate the scoring system's performance. The results show that microgrooves, macroporosity, beveling, lower extremity, ventral and dorsal margin decomposition, and lipping are the best preforming traits. The new microgroove trait proves to be a good age predictor. Reliable classification results are obtained for three age intervals (\u2264\u200929, 30-69, \u2265\u200970). Older individuals are reliably classified with two age intervals (<\u200980, \u2265\u200980). The combination of binary attributes and machine learning algorithms is a promising tool for gaining objectivity in age-at-death assessment.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the value of physical activity and exercise to patients, little is known about the perception and practices of Jordanian primary care physicians (PCPs) regarding counseling patients about exercise. This study was aimed at assessing counseling about exercise by PCPs in Jordan. A cross-sectional study targeting a random sample of physicians from family medicine, internal medicine and general practice in academic, public, and private sectors. Chi-square test of independence was used to assess the association of perceptions and practices of physicians regarding exercise counseling with their specialty. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association of demographic information with selected items of perception and practice. A total of 218 physicians participated in the study. They were mainly males (67%), family medicine physicians (42.2%), and had a mean age of 33.7 (\u00b19.87) years. Most physicians believed that less than half of patients will start exercising (91.3%) or will continue exercising if they were repeatedly counseled at follow-up visits (85.4%). Family medicine physicians counseled more patients, more frequently, and their desire to counsel more patients was significantly higher than other physicians (",

        "Title": "Using a Thermal Camera to Measure Heat Loss Through Bird Feather Coats.",
        "Abstract": "Feathers are essential to insulation, and therefore to the cost of thermoregulation,\u00a0in birds. There is robust literature on the energetic cost of thermoregulation in birds across a variety of ecological circumstances. However, few studies characterize the contribution of the feathers alone to thermoregulation. Several previous studies have established methods for measuring the insulation value of animal pelts, but they require destructive sampling methods that are problematic for birds, whose feathers are not distributed evenly across the skin. More information is needed about 1) how the contribution of feathers to thermoregulation varies both across and within species and 2) how feather coats may change over space and time. Reported here is a method for rapidly and directly measuring the thermal performance of feather coats and the skin using dried whole skin specimens, without the need to destroy the skin specimen. This method isolates and measures the thermal gradient across a feather coat in a way that measurements of heat loss and metabolic cost in live birds, which use behavioral and physiological strategies to thermoregulate, cannot. The method employs a thermal camera, which allows the rapid collection of quantitative thermal data to measure heat loss from a stable source through the skin. This protocol can easily be applied to various research questions, is applicable to any avian taxa, and does not require destruction of the skin specimen. Finally, it will further the understanding of the importance of passive thermoregulation in birds by simplifying and accelerating the collection of quantitative data.",

        "Abstract": "Timing of cranial trauma is challenging in forensic cases and literature on the subject is scarce. This study analysed the macroscopic fracture patterns of perimortem cranial fractures and compared them to experimentally reproduced cranial fractures on dry human craniums. The results showed nine traits associated with fresh cranial fractures: undulated margin, flake defects, peels with peel defects, fissures, crushed margins, bridge, bone scales and beveling. All the traits appear on the outer table or on the inner table of the cranium. Although not all characteristics must be present at the same time in all cranial fractures, they do define a new perimortem fracture pattern. Statistical analyses showed that six of these traits (undulated margins, flake defects, crushed margins, bone scales, fissures and peels) are distinctly related with perimortem (fresh) bone conditions. Considering the most discriminant perimortem traits, a decision-making algorithm is developed as a probabilistic approach to distinguish peri- from postmortem cranial fractures with an accuracy of 87%. This algorithm allows the forensic practitioner to incorporate more confidence during cranial trauma evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "The integrated assessment of nutritional status and presence of sarcopenia would help improve clinical outcomes of in-hospital aged patients. We compared three common nutritional screening tools with the new Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) diagnostic criteria among hospitalized older patients. To this, 152 older patients were assessed consecutively at hospital admission by the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), and the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002). A 46% prevalence of malnutrition was reported according to GLIM. Sensitivity was 64%, 96% and 47%, and specificity was 82%, 15% and 76% with the MUST, SGA, and NRS-2002, respectively. The concordance with GLIM criteria was 89%, 53% and 62% for the MUST, SGA, and NRS-2002, respectively. All the screening tools had a moderate value to diagnose malnutrition. Moreover, patients at high nutritional risk by MUST were more likely to present with sarcopenia than those at low risk (OR 2.5, CI 1.3-3.6). To conclude, MUST is better than SGA and NRS-2002 at detecting malnutrition in hospitalized older patients diagnosed by the new GLIM criteria. Furthermore, hospitalized older patients at high risk of malnutrition according to MUST are at high risk of presenting with sarcopenia. Nutritional status should be determined by MUST in older patients at hospital admission, followed by both GLIM and the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) assessment.",

        "Abstract": "The determinants of biodiversity patterns in the subterranean habitat called Mesovoid Shallow Substratum (MSS) are not well-understood. In this study, thirty-three scree slopes at high altitudes were selected across the Sierra de Guadarrama National Park in central Spain to investigate the effect of ten environmental variables on the abundance and species diversity of the spider and springtail assemblages from the colluvial MSS. In each locality, a multiperforated PVC tube with a pitfall trap inside was buried up to 1 m deep, and generalized linear models and Mantel tests were used to analyze the effect of mainly climate- and habitat-related variables on the diversity patterns of both taxa. A total of 1143 individual spiders belonging to 54 species and 40 811 springtail individuals belonging to 62 species were collected. The analyses indicated that cold temperatures and the presence of forest cover on the surface significantly enhance richness and abundance in the two taxa. Environmental similarity also had a small positive effect on faunistic similarity. However, the effects of temperature and habitat detected on spider richness and abundance were stronger than on springtails, whereas the reverse was found regarding faunistic similarity. These results indicate that subterranean dwellers respond differently to the same environmental factors, which in turn, points to a different degree of affinity for the MSS. The MSS plays an important role in the survival of high mountain arthropod species, acting as a climate refuge, so the protection of this habitat should be prioritized.",

        "Title": "Blood Magnesium Level and Selected Oxidative Stress Indices in Lead-Exposed Workers.",
        "Abstract": "Occupational exposure to lead is one of the important hazards to human global population. Lead interferes with divalent cations, such as calcium, magnesium, and iron. Magnesium is the fourth most common mineral in the human body and a cofactor in more than 325 enzymes. There are many disorders associated with magnesium deficiency. It has been postulated that hypomagnesemia promotes oxidative stress. Study population included 232 male employees of lead-zinc works and was divided into two sub-groups based on the median of magnesium serum level: low magnesium level (L-Mg) group and high magnesium level (H-Mg) group. Magnesium level was significantly higher in the H-Mg group than in the L-Mg group due to the study design. The level of zinc protoporphyrin was significantly higher in the L-Mg group than in the H-Mg group by 13%, while the blood lead levels were similar in the examined groups. The serum level of MDA was significantly higher in the L-Mg group than in the H-Mg group by 12%, while the serum levels of thiol groups, TAC, and bilirubin were significantly lower in that group by 6%, 3%, and 27%, respectively. Similarly, the erythrocyte SOD activity was lower in the L-Mg group than in the H-Mg group by 5%. Low serum magnesium levels contribute to lead-induced oxidative stress, result in unfavorable modification of antioxidant system function, and promote lead-induced impairment of heme synthesis. Obtained results indicate that prevention of hypomagnesemia should be regarded as an important step in ensuring adequate prophylaxis of chronic lead poisoning.",

It was realized to compare morphological traits between both species by analysing 15 adult mules (7 males and 8 females) and 150 adult horses (137 males and 13 females), with an age interval from 2 to 22 years. Data consisted of 24 different body quantitative traits which can explain the body conformation: thoracic circumference, body length (BL), thoracic depth and width, withers height (WH), sternum height, shoulders width, chest width, forelimb cannon perimeter and length, head length and width, skull length and width, face length and width, ear length and width, loin height, croup height (CrH), width and length, dock height (DoH), and hock height. Heart girth circumference, body length, withers height, croup height, and dock height were the most discriminative traits, showing statistical differences between species. The formula is X = (BL \u00d7 0.402) + (WH \u00d7 0.323) + (CrH \u00d7 0.352) + (DoH \u00d7 0.384). A value of X > 184.5 assigns with total certainty that a skeleton belongs to a horse, and if X < 174.0, it is a mule. The proposed formula has a 100% specificity but a 71.4% sensibility for mules and an 84.4% for horses into the rank of 174.0-184.5. Therefore, results demonstrate that some postcranial anatomical elements of ",

Entomobrya tristriata sp. nov. is characterised by three longitudinal dark blue stripes from Th. II to Abd. III, prelabral smooth chaetae and larger subapical tooth on mucro. However, in most species of Entomobrya, prelabral chaetae are ciliated and subapical tooth is subequal to the apical one. Entomobryoides sotoadamesi was first described from Far East of Russia and Chinese specimens agree with the original description.",

        "Abstract": "Educating and increasing awareness in the consumer to achieve a moderate alcohol consumption is key to promote a healthy lifestyle. Health care professionals (HCP), in particular community pharmacists and Primary Care (PC) physicians and nurses, are key influencers in the education to prevent risk behaviors. A consumer's poor knowledge of concepts such as standard unit, the recommendations on alcohol use, or the alcohol equivalence in the drinks consumed, can lead to a high-risk use, since \"alcohol is alcohol\" no matter what beverage contains it. Moreover, HCPs are usually not familiar with these concepts and with early detection tools such as the AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test). We propose a multidisciplinary approach (PC physicians and nurses, community pharmacy, dietists-nutritionists) to educate consumers on the risks associated with the use of alcohol, supported by the development of a protocol of action subscribed by the scientific societies of these professional groups, with the main objective of contributing to optimal and updated training for HCPs. Thus, this protocol of action aims to prevent risk behaviors through consumer education, and to detect high-risk alcohol use. Moreover, this multidisciplinary and coordinated approach should help to boost communication between the different collectives involved when providing relevant information to tackle risky alcohol use from PC.",

        "Abstract": "Eosinophils have emerged as multifaceted cells that contribute to tissue homeostasis. However, the impact of the microbiota on their frequency and function at mucosal sites remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of the microbiota in the regulation of enteric eosinophils. We found that small intestinal (SI) eosinophilia was significantly greater in germ-free (GF) mice compared to specific pathogen free (SPF) controls. This was associated with changes in the production of enteric signals that regulate eosinophil attraction and survival, and was fully reversed by complex colonization. Additionally, SI eosinophils of GF mice exhibited more cytoplasmic protrusions and less granule content than SPF controls. Lastly, we generated a novel strain of eosinophil-deficient GF mice. These mice displayed intestinal fibrosis and were less prone to allergic sensitization as compared to GF controls. Overall, our study demonstrates that commensal microbes regulate intestinal eosinophil frequency and function, which impacts tissue repair and allergic sensitization to food antigens. These data support a critical interplay between the commensal microbiota and intestinal eosinophils in shaping homeostatic, innate, and adaptive immune processes in health and disease.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of the study was to determine the relationship between serum concentrations of selenium (SeS) and zinc (ZnS), total antioxidant status (TAS) and endothelial function assessed by ultrasonographic method of dilatation of the brachial artery in 141 hypertensive patients. Patients with SeS\u2009<\u2009median were characterized by a statistically significantly lower flow-mediated dilation (FMD) than patients with SeS\u2009\u2265\u2009median. Patients with TAS\u2009<\u2009median were characterized by a significantly lower FMD than patients with TAS\u2009\u2265\u2009median. Older age, higher BMI, male gender, higher blood total cholesterol, ischemic heart disease, smoking and lower SeS constitute independent predictors of inferior endothelial function, expressed in lower FMD values. Smoking is an independent predictor of lower TAS, and the use of \u03b2-blockers and higher serum selenium levels are independent predictors of higher TAS. In summary, a decrease in TAS should be considered as a mechanism of inferior endothelial function in hypertensive patients conditioned by a decrease in SeS.",

From the different approaches that have been proposed to analyse this issue, the hypothesis of the existence of association patterns of different chronic conditions is gaining visibility. In addition, multimorbidity can be associated to polypharmacy, which can lead to a higher risk of potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) and consequently to adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The general objective of this novel study is to identify the association between PIP, multimorbidity patterns, polypharmacy and the presence of ADRs in older patients admitted for exacerbation of chronic diseases.",

        "Abstract": "The current study evaluated levels of macro-/trace elements, select cytokines, and sperm quality, in the semen of men with abnormal spermograms. The study population of men with abnormal spermograms was divided into three groups, i.e., oligospermic, asthenozoospermic, and oligoasthenozoospermic. The control group was fertile men with normal semen parameters. Analyses showed that in comparison with that in the semen of the fertile men, levels of calcium, magnesium, and selenium were significantly lower in men with all three groups. Semen levels of zinc were significantly lower in men with asthenospermia as compared with that in control. GGT (gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase) activity in semen was significantly higher in men in any of the three states as compared with that seen in control semen. In contrast, semen ALT (alanine aminotransferase) activity was reduced in men with any of these abnormalities compared with that in the controls. Semen cholesterol levels were significantly lower in men with asthenospermia as compared with control semen. Of all the measured cytokines, only IL-5 levels were reduced in the semen of the men with any of the conditions as compared with control semen. The semen of infertile males is characterized by reduced levels of calcium, magnesium, and trace metals such as zinc and selenium. The study also indicated that measures of cholesterol and of GGT/ALT activities could serve as supplementary parameters indicative of semen quality. Further investigations are needed to clarify the role of the measured parameters in sperm physiology.",

        "Abstract": "Neurocysticercosis is one of the most common parasitic diseases of the brain, it is caused by Taenia solium. Human infection occurs as a result of the ingestion of parasite eggs or undercooked pork. Most infections are recorded in endemic regions, i.e.: South America, Asia, India, Africa, China and Nepal. In cysticercosis, central nervous system involvement accounts for 60-90% of all cases of infection. The location of the changes in the brain is different. Cysts can occur in the ventricles of the brain, in the parenchyma, subarachnoid, within the spinal cord or cerebellum. In recent decades, the prognosis of patients with neurocysticercosis has improved as a result of increased expenditure on health care, education, sanitary and epidemiological supervision and new diagnostic methods. In the first half of the 20th century, infections were almost completely eliminated in Europe. In contrast, the problem is constantly occurring in developing countries. The diagnosis of brain changes is troublesome because it is often impossible to take samples and thus cannot be histopathologically examined. Imaging and serological tests are used to make the diagnosis. The final diagnosis is difficult because changes in the brain may be atypical, and their variability as a result of evolution is an additional factor forcing a deeper diagnosis. In the course of neurocysticercosis histopathological examination, ELISA without modification is not useful. However, imaging tests such as: magnetic resonance imaging (taking into account various protocols), computed tomography, Ag-ELISA are used. Despite the advanced technique, making the diagnosis still causes problems. Therefore, differential diagnosis and confirmation of diagnosis is needed by both imaging and serological tests.",

        "Abstract": "Epigenetic clocks comprise a set of CpG sites whose DNA methylation levels measure subject age. These clocks are acknowledged as a highly accurate molecular correlate of chronological age in humans and other vertebrates. Also, extensive research is aimed at their potential to quantify biological aging rates and test longevity or rejuvenating interventions. Here, we discuss key challenges to understand clock mechanisms and biomarker utility. This requires dissecting the drivers and regulators of age-related changes in single-cell, tissue- and disease-specific models, as well as exploring other epigenomic marks, longitudinal and diverse population studies, and non-human models. We also highlight important ethical issues in forensic age determination and predicting the trajectory of biological aging in an individual.",

        "Abstract": "Cadmium exposure contributes to internal organ dysfunction and the development of chronic diseases. The aim of the study was to assess the alleviating effect of \u03b1-lipoic acid and/or magnesium on cadmium-induced oxidative stress and disorders in bone metabolism, kidney and liver function, and hematological and biochemical parameters changes. Male rats were exposed to cadmium (30 mg Cd/kg of feed) for three months. Some animals exposed to Cd were supplemented with magnesium (150 mg Mg/kg of feed) and/or with \u03b1-lipoic acid (100 mg/kg body weight, four times a week). Cd intake inhibited body weight gain and lowered hemoglobin concentration, whereas it increased the activities of liver enzymes, as well as the level of oxidative stress, CTX-1 (C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, bone resorption marker), and CRP (C-reactive protein, marker of inflammation); it decreased vitamin D3, GSH (reduced glutathione), and the serum urea nitrogen/creatinine index. Mg and/or \u03b1-lipoic acid supplementation increased the antioxidant potential, and partially normalized the studied biochemical parameters. The obtained results show that both magnesium and \u03b1-lipoic acid decrease oxidative stress and the level of inflammatory marker, as well as normalize bone metabolism and liver and kidney function. Combined intake of \u03b1-lipoic acid and magnesium results in reinforcement of the protective effect; especially, it increases antioxidant defense.",

        "Abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common human malignancy in the world, with high mortality and poor prognosis for patients. Among the risk factors are tobacco and alcohol intake, human papilloma virus, and also genetic and epigenetic modifications. Many studies show that epigenetic events play an important role in HNSCC development and progression, including DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, histone posttranslational covalent modifications, and effects of non-coding RNA. Epigenetic modifications may influence silencing of tumor suppressor genes by promoter hypermethylation, regulate transcription by microRNAs and changes in chromatin structure, or induce genome instability through hypomethylation. Moreover, getting to better understand aberrant patterns of methylation may provide biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis, while knowledge about target genes of microRNAs may improve the therapy of HNSCC and extend overall survival. The aim of this review is to present recent studies which demonstrate the role of epigenetic regulation in the development of HNSCC.",

        "Abstract": "The development of targeted therapies has been a consistent goal for hormone-related diseases treatment. As a result of increased knowledge of the role of androgens in different diseases, anti-androgen treatment is becoming increasingly important in targeted therapy. Androgens play an important role in different disorders, therefore, androgen receptor signalling is a crucial factor in pathological conditions. The androgen receptor is a transcription factor activated by the testosterone metabolite 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone and regulates the expression of genes related to sexual differentiation, growth and survival of prostate cells, and to a certain extent, cancer progression. Herein, we review anti-androgen therapies in cancer and other selected diseases and provide examples where anti-androgen drugs can be used as both main and supportive treatments in the multimodal therapeutic scheme. Even in diseases with low serum levels of testosterone or DHT, anti-androgen therapy plays an important role in new treatments. Therefore, the use of anti-androgens is an appealing strategy in which to overcome resistance to primary treatment by assuring better therapy results. In this review, we take into account both older generation hormonal drugs and the new drug classes. Additionally, we review recent studies that suggest new anti-androgen agents have not entirely replaced some of the old standards.",

        "Abstract": "Bacterial infections are the most common cause of purulent soft tissue inflammations in the head and neck area. These bacteria are also responsible for the majority of inflammatory complications after third molar removal. The key to success of antibacterial treatment in both cases is the use of an appropriate antibacterial agent. The aim of the study was to evaluate the susceptibility profile of bacteria isolated from material collected from patients with intraoral odontogenic abscesses. The test material consisted of swabs taken from the odontogenic abscesses, after their incision and drainage. Another swab was collected from the lesion area, 10 days after the initial visit. Results were compared with an identical study conducted on a control group of healthy patients, who had undergone third molar removal. Bacteria identified in this study consisted of aerobic and anaerobic strains, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative. According to the EUCAST guidelines, none of the tested antibiotics was recommended for all identified bacteria. The percentage of bacterial strains sensitive to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was 78.13% and 81.48% in the study and control groups, respectively, whereas, the percentage of those sensitive to clindamycin was 96.43% and 80.00%, respectively. For Gram-negative aerobic bacteria, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were among medications affecting all cultured species. 100.00% of strains were found to be susceptible to these antibiotics. Statistically significant relationship between the presence of Gram-negative aerobic strains and the occurrence of complications was found. In the case of the most frequently occurring bacteria in the study, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid and clindamycin were shown to be very effective. In cases of severe purulent odontogenic inflammations, it is recommended to use a combination of antibiotics. Amoxicillin with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin with cefuroxime seem to be the proper choices based on the results of this study.",

        "Abstract": "In chronic heart failure (HF), some parameters of oxidative stress are correlated with disease severity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of oxidative stress biomarkers in prognostic risk stratification (death and combined endpoint: heart transplantation or death). In 774 patients, aged 48-59 years, with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction (median: 24.0 (20-29)%), parameters such as total antioxidant capacity, total oxidant status, oxidative stress index, and concentration of uric acid (UA), bilirubin, protein sulfhydryl groups (PSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured. The parameters were assessed as predictive biomarkers of mortality and combined endpoint in a 1-year follow-up. The multivariate Cox regression analysis was adjusted for other important clinical and laboratory prognostic markers. Among all the oxidative stress markers examined in multivariate analysis, only MDA and UA were found to be independent predictors of death and combined endpoint. Higher serum MDA concentration increased the risk of death by 103.0% (HR = 2.103; 95% CI (1.330-3.325)) and of combined endpoint occurrence by 100% (HR = 2.000; 95% CI (1.366-2.928)) per ",

        "Abstract": "In previous GWAS carried out in a Duroc commercial line (Lipgen population), we detected on pig chromosomes 3, 4 and 14 several QTL for gluteus medius muscle redness (GM a*), electric conductivity in the longissimus dorsi muscle (LD CE) and vaccenic acid content in the LD muscle (LD C18:1 n\u00a0-\u00a07), respectively. We have genotyped, in the Lipgen population, 19 SNPs mapping to 14 genes located within these QTL. Subsequently, association analyses have been performed. After correction for multiple testing, two SNPs in the TGFBRAP1 (rs321173745) and SELENOI (rs330820437) genes were associated with GM a*, whereas ACADSB (rs81449951) and GPR26 (rs343087568) genotypes displayed significant associations with LD vaccenic content. Moreover, the polymorphisms located at the ATP1A2 (rs344748241), ATP8B2 (rs81382410) and CREB3L4 (rs321278469 and rs330133789) genes showed significant associations with LD CE. We made a second round of association analyses including the SNPs mentioned above as well as other SNPs located in the chromosomes to which they map. After performing a correction for multiple testing, the only association that remained significant at the chromosome-wide level was that between the ATP1A2 genotype and LD CE. From a functional point of view, this association is meaningful because this locus encodes a subunit of the Na",

        "Abstract": "Multiple births or twinning in equids are dangerous, undesirable situations that compromise the life of the dam and resulting offspring. However, embryo vitrification and freezing techniques take advantage of individuals whose multiple ovulations allow flushing more fertilised embryos from the oviduct to be collected, increasing the productivity and profitability of reproductive techniques. Embryo preservation is especially important in highly endangered populations such as certain donkey (Equus asinus) breeds; for which conventional reproductive techniques have previously been deemed inefficient. For instance, becoming an effective alternative to artificial insemination with frozen semen to preserve the individuals' genetic material. The objective of this study was to examine the historical foaling records of Andalusian donkeys to estimate prevalence, risk factors, phenotypic and genetic parameters for multiple births, assessing the cumulative foal number born per animal, maximum foal number per birth and multiple birth number per animal. We designed a Bayesian General Animal Mixed Model with single records considering the 'fixed' effects of birth year, birth season, birth month, sex, farm, location, and husbandry system. Age was considered and included as a linear and quadratic covariate. Gibbs sampling reported heritability estimates ranging from 0.18\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.101 to 0.24\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.078. Genetic and phenotypic correlations ranged from 0.496\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.298 to 0.846\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.152 and 0.206\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.063 to 0.607\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.054, respectively. Predicted breeding values obtained enable the potential selection against/for these traits, offering a new perspective for donkey breeding and conservation.",

        "Abstract": "New type of carriers based on grafted poly(ionic liquid)s was designed for delivery of ionically attached salicylates (Sal). Choline derived ionic liquid monomeric units were successfully introduced with various content in the side chains by the controlled radical polymerization. Properly high amounts of ionic pharmaceutics in the polymer systems were achieved by the well-fitted length and grafting degree of the side chains. In aqueous solution the graft copolymers were self-assembled into the spherical superstructures with sizes up to 73\u2009nm. Delivery studies showed \"burst\" release within 4\u2009h, after that it was slower yielding ~70% of released drug within 80\u2009h. Proposed nanocarriers supported low toxicity against human cells (NHDF and BEAS-2B), anti-inflammation activity evaluated with the use of pro-inflammatory interleukins (IL-6 and IL-8) and antibacterial activities towards E. coli. Adjustment of ionic drug content by structural parameters of graft copolymers, including grafting degree and graft length, are advantageous to tailor nanocarriers with self-assembly properties in aqueous media. Effective release process by ionic exchange and biological activity with low toxicity are promising for further development of this type of drug delivery (DDS).",

        "Abstract": "Among adipose-derived factors, adipocytokines play roles as hormones and signaling mediators for apoptotic pathway. Among of them, vaspin, regulates the metabolism of adipose tissue itself as an endocrine organ, and stimulates adipocytes to maturation, differentiation, etc. Damaged adipocytes, present in obesity and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) respond with over-production of inflammatory cytokines. Such pro-inflammatory stimulation remains under adipokine control. Pro-inflammatory pathways are connected to oxidative stress and apoptosis, reported as co-existing with an elevated level of some adipokines in cancer cell lines. However, some hormones, such as vaspin, reduce apoptosis, have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative roles in cancer cell lines.",

        "Abstract": "Identification of modifiable risk factors for breast cancer is critical for primary prevention of the disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate how certain lifestyle variables modify the chances of developing breast cancer based on menopausal status. A case-control study was performed in a group of 542 women, 197 who were diagnosed with breast cancer and 344 control individuals. The groups were matched by age, body mass index, and menopausal status. Participants were evaluated for level of physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking habit, weight, height, and waist circumference (WC). A multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Regular consumption of alcoholic beverages (2.91, 95% CI 1.58-5.38 and 1.86, 95% CI 1.15-3.03) and sedentary behavior (2.08; 95% CI 1.12-3.85 and 1.81; 95% CI 1.12-2.94) were associated with breast cancer risk in pre- and postmenopausal women, respectively. High WC (3.31, 95% CI 1.45-7.55) was associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer in premenopausal women. While in postmenopausal women, current smoking (2.43, 95% CI 1.01-5.83) or previous history of smoking (1.90; 95% CI 1.14-3.14) increased the chances of developing breast cancer. Sedentary behavior and current consumption of alcoholic beverages were more likely to increase the risk of developing breast cancer regardless of menopausal status.",

        "Abstract": "The population of Spanish sheep has decreased from 24 to 15 million heads in the last 75\u00a0years due to multiple social and economic factors. Such a demographic reduction might have caused an increase in homozygosity and inbreeding, thus limiting the viability of local breeds with excellent adaptations to harsh ecosystems. The main goal of our study was to investigate the homozygosity patterns of 11 Spanish ovine breeds and to elucidate the relationship of these Spanish breeds with reference populations from Europe, Africa and the Near East. By using Ovine SNP50 BeadChip data retrieved from previous publications, we have found that the majority of studied Spanish ovine breeds have close genetic relatedness with other European populations; the one exception is the Canaria de Pelo breed, which is similar to North African breeds. Our analysis has also demonstrated that, with few exceptions, the genomes of Spanish sheep harbor fewer than 50 runs of homozygosity (ROH) with a total length of less than 350\u00a0Mb. Moreover, the frequencies of very long ROH (>30\u00a0Mb) are very low, and the inbreeding coefficients (F",

        "Abstract": "Due to its distinct properties, wild boar meat is considered a highly desirable consumer product, in a market that is expanding. Outdoor production is also favoured by consumers who value animal welfare and environmental sustainability when choosing meat products. There is evidence that farms that include pasture for grazing typically have reduced feeding costs. Such production systems can also be more environmentally sustainable as the input (pasture) is inedible to humans, compared to conventional indoor systems, which use human-edible feeds (e.g., soya). However, some wild boar farms have performed poorly compared to those rearing other swine such as hybrid wild boar and domestic pigs. Diet is central to all livestock production and is likely a significant influencing factor of wild boar performance, both in terms of forage consumption and nutritional composition. Other factors may also influence performance, such as weather, behaviour and grazing management. Wild boar production systems hold their own intrinsic value in a growing marketplace. However, information gathered through the study of wild boar has external applications in informing outdoor domestic pig production systems to encourage the use of pasture as part of the habitat of domestic pigs.",

        "Abstract": "Both gut microbiota and diet have been shown to impact visceral fat mass (VFM), a major risk factor for cardiometabolic disease, but their relative contribution has not been well characterised. We aimed to estimate and separate the effect of gut microbiota composition from that of nutrient intake on VFM in 1760 older female twins. Through pairwise association analyses, we identified 93 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 10 nutrients independently linked to VFM (FDR\u2009<\u20095%). Conditional analyses revealed that the majority (87%) of the 93 VFM-associated OTUs remained significantly associated with VFM irrespective of nutrient intake correction. In contrast, we observed that the effect of fibre, magnesium, biotin and vitamin E on VFM was partially mediated by OTUs. Moreover, we estimated that OTUs were more accurate predictors of VFM than nutrients and accounted for a larger percentage of its variance. Our results suggest that while the role of certain nutrients on VFM appears to depend on gut microbiota composition, specific gut microbes may affect host adiposity regardless of dietary intake. The findings imply that the gut microbiota may have a greater contribution towards shaping host VFM than diet alone. Thus, microbial-based therapy should be prioritised for VFM reduction in overweight and obese subjects.",

        "Title": "Kaiso-induced intestinal inflammation is preceded by diminished E-cadherin expression and intestinal integrity.",
        "Abstract": "Chronic intestinal inflammation contributes to pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colon cancer. While the precise etiology remains controversial, IBD is believed to manifest as a result of various factors. We previously reported that intestinal-specific overexpression of the transcription factor Kaiso results in an intestinal inflammatory response; however, the cause of this inflammation is unknown. To elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) of the Kaiso-mediated intestinal inflammatory phenotype, we evaluated two independent transgenic mouse lines that express varying levels of Kaiso (KaisoTg). Histological analyses of KaisoTg mice revealed intestinal damage including thickening of the mucosa, intestinal \"lesions\" and crypt abscesses, which are reminiscent of IBD pathology. Additionally, higher Kaiso levels induced intestinal neutrophilia as early as 12 weeks, which worsened as the mice aged. Notably, the Kaiso-induced intestinal inflammation correlated with a leaky intestinal barrier and mis-regulation of E-cadherin expression and localization. Interestingly, Kaiso overexpression resulted in reduced proliferation but enhanced migration of intestinal epithelial cells prior to the onset of inflammation. Collectively, these data suggest that Kaiso plays a role in regulating intestinal epithelial cell integrity and function, dysregulation of which contributes to a chronic inflammatory phenotype as mice age.",

        "Title": "Superoxide dismutase activity as a predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.",
        "Abstract": "Oxidative stress contributes to progression of heart failure (HF). The present study analyzed the efficacy of the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and its isoenzymes (CuZnSOD and MnSOD) as prognostic factors in dilated cardiomyopathy. The usefulness of activities of total SOD, MnSOD, and CuZnSOD was assessed, taking into account clinical, echocardiographic, and laboratory parameters as risk predictors of long-term clinical outcomes (death, heart transplant, combined end point) in 109 patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM) in this study with a 5-year follow-up. Regression analysis showed that total serum SOD activity was a predictor of worse long-term clinical outcome even after adjustment for NT-proBNP, hemoglobin, sodium, creatinine clearance, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), BMI, and NYHA class (LVEF: HR 1.059, 95% CI 1.007-1.114, P\u2009=\u20090.026; BMI: HR 1.073, 95% CI 1.021-1.126, P\u2009=\u20090.005; NYHA: HR 1.073, 95% CI 1.022-1.126, P\u2009=\u20090.005). MnSOD and CuZnSOD activities were also predictors of worse long-term clinical outcome even after adjustment for laboratory parameters and BMI or NYHA class; however, after adjustment for LVEF, a borderline statistical significance was achieved (LVEF: HR 1.054, 95% CI 0.993-1.119, P\u2009=\u20090.081 [MnSOD]; HR 1.092, 95% CI 0.989-1.297, P\u2009=\u20090.082 [CuZnSOD]). Increased activities of total serum SOD and its isoenzymes in NIDCM patients correspond with a poor prognosis and may have prognostic value in the prediction of long-term clinical outcomes. In conclusion, the present study shows that serum SOD activity may be a useful predictor of adverse outcome in HF.",

        "Abstract": "The present work reports the production and characterization of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) nanocomposite filaments incorporating carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphite nanoplates (GnP), electrically conductive and suitable for fused deposition modeling (FDM) processing. The nanocomposites were manufactured by melt mixing and those presenting electrical conductivity near 10 S/m were selected for the production of filaments for FDM. The extruded filaments were characterized for mechanical and thermal conductivity, polymer crystallinity, thermal relaxation, nanoparticle dispersion, thermoelectric effect, and coefficient of friction. They presented electrical conductivity in the range of 1.5 to 13.1 S/m, as well as good mechanical performance and higher thermal conductivity compared to PEEK. The addition of GnP improved the composites' melt processability, maintained the electrical conductivity at target level, and reduced the coefficient of friction by up to 60%. Finally, three-dimensional (3D) printed test specimens were produced, showing a Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength comparable to those of the filaments, but a lower strain at break and electrical conductivity. This was attributed to the presence of large voids in the part, revealing the need for 3D printing parameter optimization. Finally, filament production was up-scaled to kilogram scale maintaining the properties of the research-scale filaments.",

        "Abstract": "Despite high similarity of canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), bovine coronavirus, (BCoV) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), these viruses differ in species specificity. For years it was believed that they share receptor specificity, utilizing sialic acids for cell surface attachment, internalization, and entry. Interestingly, careful literature analysis shows that viruses indeed bind to the cell surface via sialic acids, but there is no solid data that these moieties mediate virus entry. In our study, using a number of techniques, we showed that all three viruses are indeed able to bind to sialic acids to a different extent, but these molecules render the cells permissive only for the clinical strain of HCoV-OC43, while for others they serve only as attachment receptors. CRCoV and BCoV appear to employ human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-1) as the entry receptor. Furthermore, we identified heparan sulfate as an alternative attachment factor, but this may be related to the cell culture adaptation, as in ex vivo conditions, it does not seem to play a significant role. Summarizing, we delineated early events during CRCoV, BCoV, and HCoV-OC43 entry and systematically studied the attachment and entry receptor utilized by these viruses.",

ROS levels can be increased radically by external factors, including ionizing and UV radiation or exposure to chemical compounds. These increased ROS levels can, in turn, lead to oxidative damage of DNA. Natural plant treatments against cancer can modulate these processes by inducing or decreasing ROS production.",

        "Abstract": "An alternative to cultured skin cell grafts usage in burn treatment is the graft of allogenic stem cells. We verified whether amniotic stem cells are better than the present therapeutic standard: grafts of autologous keratinocytes and fibroblasts along with autologous adipose-derived stem cells, and whether amniotic stem cells can support the growth of autologous keratinocytes and fibroblasts in the culture. The study was performed on the material from 18 amnia. Skin cells were obtained from 3 patients. In order to assess the influence of stem cells on keratinocytes and fibroblasts, the following experiments were performed: impact on viability and cell cycle, wound healing capability, angiogenesis capability, influence on the proliferation speed and capability to differentiate into skin cells. We demonstrated that human amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMMSCs) share amniotic proteins with skin cells. Amniotic stem cells may replace skin fibroblasts in grafts due to the close similarity in their surface antigens, with significantly larger proliferative potential and ability to stimulate wound healing. It was shown that adding amniotic cells to both keratinocytes and fibroblast cultures accelerates directional migration by \u2265\u202f40%. We confirmed in this study the influence of amniotic cells on the proliferation and cell cycle of fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Amniotic stem cells can be successfully used not only as a first choice graft but also to replace 3T3 line cells, supporting the proliferation of the cells during the culturing, as well as a supplementary graft supporting an autologous graft of keratinocytes and fibroblasts.",

        "Title": "Comprehensive Investigation of miRNome Identifies Novel Candidate miRNA-mRNA Interactions Implicated in T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.",
        "Abstract": "T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive malignancy originating from T-cell precursors. The genetic landscape of T-ALL has been largely characterized by next-generation sequencing. Yet, the transcriptome of miRNAs (miRNome) of T-ALL has been less extensively studied. Using small RNA sequencing, we characterized the miRNome of 34 pediatric T-ALL samples, including the expression of isomiRs and the identification of candidate novel miRNAs (not previously annotated in miRBase). For the first time, we show that immunophenotypic subtypes of T-ALL present different miRNA expression profiles. To extend miRNome characteristics in T-ALL (to 82\u202fT-ALL cases), we combined our small RNA-seq results with data available in Gene Expression Omnibus. We report on miRNAs most abundantly expressed in pediatric T-ALL and miRNAs differentially expressed in T-ALL versus normal mature T-lymphocytes and thymocytes, representing candidate oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs. Using eight target prediction algorithms and pathway enrichment analysis, we identified differentially expressed miRNAs and their predicted targets implicated in processes (defined in Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) of potential importance in pathogenesis of T-ALL, including interleukin-6-mediated signaling, mTOR signaling, and regulation of apoptosis. We finally focused on hsa-mir-106a-363 cluster and functionally validated direct interactions of hsa-miR-20b-5p and hsa-miR-363-3p with 3' untranslated regions of their predicted targets (PTEN, SOS1, LATS2), overrepresented in regulation of apoptosis. hsa-mir-106a-363 is a paralogue of prototypic oncogenic hsa-mir-17-92 cluster with yet unestablished role in the pathogenesis of T-ALL. Our study provides a firm basis and data resource for functional analyses on the role of miRNA-mRNA interactions in T-ALL.",

        "Abstract": "The role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of chronic venous disease (CVD) remains obscure. It has been postulated that oscillatory flow present in incompetent veins causes proinflammatory changes. Our earlier study confirmed this hypothesis. This study is aimed at assessing chemokines and growth factors (GFs) released by lymphocytes in patients with great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence. In 34 patients exhibiting reflux in GSV, blood was derived from the cubital vein and from the incompetent saphenofemoral junction. In 12 healthy controls, blood was derived from the cubital vein. Lymphocyte culture with and without stimulation by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was performed. Eotaxin, interleukin 8 (IL-8), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 A and 1B (MIP-1A and MIP-1B), interferon gamma-induced protein (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin 5 (IL-5), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were assessed in culture supernatants by a Bio-Plex assay. Higher concentrations of eotaxin and G-CSF were revealed in the incompetent GSV, compared with the concentrations in the patients' upper limbs. The concentrations of MIP-1A and MIP-1B were higher in the CVD group while the concentration of VEGF was lower. In the stimulated cultures, the concentration of G-CSF proved higher in the incompetent GSV, as compared with the patients' upper limbs. Between the groups, the concentration of eotaxin was higher in the CVD group, while the IL-5 and MCP-1 concentrations were lower. IL-8, IP-10, FGF, GM-CSF, and PDGF-BB did not reveal any significant differences in concentrations between the samples. These observations suggest that the concentrations of chemokines and GFs are different in the blood of CVD patients. The oscillatory flow present in incompetent veins may play a role in these changes. However, the role of cytokines in CVD requires further study.",

        "Abstract": "Our study assessed the methylation status of the SFRP1, SFRP2, RASSF1A, RAR\u03b2 and DAPK1 genes, which are associated with epigenetic silencing in cancers. In a group of 75 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma, aberrant methylation was detected using methylation-specific PCR in tumours and matched margins. Our results showed significantly higher methylation frequency in tumours than in surgical margin of SFRP2 (26.6% vs 11.9%, p\u2009<\u20090.05) and DAPK1 (65.3% vs 41.3%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) genes. Moreover, methylation of the SFRP1 and DAPK1 genes was associated with older age. Advanced tumour stages were associated with lower rates of SFRP1 gene methylation. Decreased methylation levels of the SFRP2 and RASSF1A genes were associated with positive N stage. On the contrary, lymph node metastasis were associated with higher methylation rates of RAR\u03b2 and DAPK1 genes. Patients with a familial history of cancer were associated with more frequently methylated SFRP1, SFRP2 and DAPK1 genes. Hypermethylation of DAPK1 was associated with decreased risk of death in patients. Our results are suggestive, although not conclusive, that some epigenetic changes, especially frequent hypermethylation of SFRP2 and DAPK1 genes, can be useful as potential diagnostic biomarkers of oral cavity cancer. Moreover, estimating the methylation status in surgical margins could become an additional strategy for more accurate treatment methods. Further efforts are needed to identify and validate this finding on a larger patient group and using new advanced methylation testing methods.",

        "Title": "Novel trends in application of stem cells in skin wound healing.",
        "Abstract": "The latest findings indicate the huge therapeutic potential of stem cells in regenerative medicine, including the healing of chronic wounds. Main stem cell types involved in wound healing process are: epidermal and dermal stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In the therapy of chronic wounds, they can be administrated either topically or using different matrix like hydrogels, scaffolds, dermal substitutes and extracellular matrix (ECM) derivatives. Stem cells are proven to positively influence wound healing by different direct and indirect mechanisms including residing cells stimulation, biomolecules release, inflammation control and ECM remodelling. MSCs are especially worth mentioning as they can be easily derived from bone-marrow or adipose tissue. Apart from traditional approach of administering living stem cells to wounds, new trends have emerged in recent years. Good healing results are obtained using stem cell secretome alone, for example exosomes or conditioned media. There are also attempts to improve healing potential of stem cells by their co-culture with other cell types as well as by their genetic modifications or pretreatment using different chemicals or cell media. Moreover, stem cells have been tested for novel therapeutic purposes like for example acute burns and have been used in experiments on large animal models including pigs and sheep. In this review we discuss the role of stem cells in skin wound healing acceleration. In addition, we analyse possible new strategies of stem cells application in treatment of chronic wounds.",

        "Abstract": "This study aims to improve a previous study that reported new traits to characterize a perimortem fracture pattern in human long bones. This second study aims to acquire further knowledge about these perimortem traits, specifically by improving the experimental setting-by using a Blunt Force Trauma Simulator-and increasing the sample size with a total of 43 autopsy specimens and 57 reproduced fractures. Additionally, we investigated whether these traits could be related to muscular contractions by adding axial compression in the experimentally fractured specimens. If intra vitam traits can be found, it would consequentially be more valuable for forensic anthropologists to shorten the perimortem period. We demonstrate that all traits are perimortem traits. Furthermore, based on our results, we see the tendency that the combination of traits-instead of the presence of each trait individually-may make it possible to distinguish intra vitam from perimortem fractures. This study confirms these distinct characteristics that can be valuable to utilize in the distinction between peri- and postmortem fractures.",

Five species from Western Europe are redescribed and their dorsal detailed chaetotaxy is revealed for the first time: S. domestica (Nicolet), S. dinizi Gama, S. ferrarii Parona, S. mantis Zeppelini Bellini and S. pini Jordana Arbea, the first two from type locality, and the latter two based on analysis of the type material. A note on chaetal interpretation of the first abdominal segment for Seira is presented. An identification key to 31 species with known dorsal chaetotaxy from Western Palearctic region is also provided, including a discussion on dense macrochaetotaxy present in Palearctic and Oriental species and its reduction in species from others biogeographic regions.",

        "Abstract": "This paper examines a single genus of springtails (Collembola, Entomobryidae, Entomobrya) across the Canary Islands archipelago. A great sampling effort carried out more than 20 years ago, and over several years, allows us to present the distribution of the genus with the presence of 17 species, some better represented by their abundance than others. In addition to some species present in continental Europe or elsewhere in the world, or those already reported for the Canary Islands (e.g., E. multifasciata (Tullberg, 1871), E. nigrocincta Denis, 1923, E. palmensis Jordana Baquero, 2010, E. quinquelineata B\u00f6rner, 1901 and E. unostrigata Stach, 1930), 12 new species have been detected and described, representing 71% of the total species found. All new species have been named in honour of important persons to the history of the Canary Islands, including some leaders. A combination of colouring patterns and other morphological characteristics that are easy to observe in most specimens (Katz et al. 2015a, b) have been used for the identification of the specimens, as is usual for the genus (Christiansen 1958), in addition to the dorsal macrochaetotaxy formula proposed by Jordana Baquero (2005). Without this formula, many specimens could not have been identified or distinguished from already described species because the colourations -in many cases-show ranges so broad as not to be diagnostic. In some species, the range of colouration can range from totally clear to totally dark, including several intermediate forms. Colour could be a good indicator of the species captured, taking into account that it fades over time with exposure to ethyl alcohol and could turn to different tones. Notwithstanding the above, a recent paper by Ding et al. (2018), show a certain correlation between the color pattern and the specific differentiation by means of DNA studies.",

The study group consisted of 103 fertile males. Based on semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count, and percentage of motile sperm at 1 hour postcollection, the individuals were divided into two equal groups-those with excellent (EX) semen quality and those with mediocre (ME) semen quality. The remaining measured parameters characterizing motility and the percentage of normal morphology were higher in the EX group than in the ME group; however, the seminal plasma pH did not differ between the examined groups. The phosphate level was 31% lower in the EX group than in the ME group, whereas there was a tendency toward a 25% lower level of Fe in the EX group than in the ME group (",

        "Abstract": "The goal of the current study is to analyse the gene expression profile of the ovine skeletal muscle as well as to characterize the genetic variation of transcripts expressed in such tissue. This aim has been achieved by sequencing the longissimus dorsi transcriptomes of 50 sheep distributed in five pools representing the Canaria de Pelo, Roja Mallorquina, Gallega, Xisqueta and Ripollesa Spanish autochthonous breeds. Approximately, 363 million reads per pool have been produced and 71.9-82.9% have been successfully mapped to the ovine genome in a paired-end mode (2\u2009\u00d7\u200975\u2009bp). The 200 most expressed muscle transcripts (\u22481% of the total transcript count) account for 51% (Canaria de Pelo) to 67% (Gallega) of the total ovine skeletal muscle mRNA expression. These highly expressed genes play key roles in pathways related with striated muscle contraction, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, citric acid cycle and respiratory electron transport. RNA-Sequencing of muscle transcripts has also revealed that ~72% of the SNPs detected with this approach are shared by at least two pools, and 10% of them segregate in the five pools under analysis. Most of the substitutions detected by RNA-Seq are synonymous or missense and only a minority are predicted to have consequences on protein function.",

Yerba mate has presented a potential use as preventive and therapeutic agent on diabetes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of yerba mate on different tissues of diabetic rats, focusing on energetic metabolism. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin, followed by daily yerba mate treatment. After 30 days, the animals were euthanized to evaluate metabolic parameters on liver, adipose tissue, muscle and serum. The results showed mate treatment promoted a decrease in retroperitoneal adipose tissue in healthy animals. Muscle weight returned to control levels in diabetic rats treated with mate. There was improvement on serum glucose, creatinine, urea and total protein levels associated with mate treatment. Muscle parameters, such as glucose uptake and carbon dioxide production, were improved by mate treatment to control levels. The results evidenced the beneficial actions mate can have on metabolic disturbances of diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "Associations among lead exposure, blood morphology, and cytokines influencing hematopoiesis are still inconclusive. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to demonstrate whether workers chronically exposed to lead demonstrate changes in complete blood count (CBC) parameters associated with altered levels of selected cytokines influencing hematopoiesis. The study covered 80 male subjects employed in the zinc-lead works in Miasteczko \u015al\u0105skie. The subjects were divided into two groups: control group (24 healthy administration workers without a history of occupational exposure to lead compounds) and lead exposed group (56 subjects exposed to lead compounds in their work environment). The values of HTC, MCV, MCH, RDW-CV, PDW, and LMR were significantly lower in the exposed group than in the controls by 3%, 5%, 3%, 4%, 15%, and 47%, respectively. However, the levels of MCHC and MPV were higher in the exposed group than in the controls by 3% and 11%, respectively. Analogically, the values of MXD and MXD% were also significantly higher by 118% and 70%, respectively. The concentration of IL-7 was significantly higher in the exposed group compared to the controls by 143%. In this study, chronic lead exposure in the occupational setting at levels <50\u202f\u03bcg/dl does not affect RBC count and hemoglobin level but decreases MCV and hematocrit. Similarly, chronic lead toxicity does not affect WBC count but alters proportions of different types of leukocytes with significant increase of MXD count associated with elevated level of IL-7. Oppositely to a short-term lead exposure, chronic lead exposure elevates MPV and does not alter PLT count.",

        "Abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins are typically indistinguishable via forensic DNA profiling. Recently, we demonstrated that epigenetic differentiation of MZ twins is feasible; however, proportions of twin differentially methylated CpG sites (tDMSs) identified in reference-type blood DNA were not replicated in trace-type blood DNA. Here we investigated buccal swabs as typical forensic reference material, and saliva and cigarette butts as commonly encountered forensic trace materials. As an analog to a forensic case, we analyzed one MZ twin pair. Epigenome-wide microarray analysis in reference-type buccal DNA revealed 25 candidate tDMSs with >0.5 twin-to-twin differences. MethyLight quantitative PCR (qPCR) of 22 selected tDMSs in trace-type DNA revealed in saliva DNA that six tDMSs (27.3%) had >0.1 twin-to-twin differences, seven (31.8%) had smaller (<0.1) but robustly detected differences, whereas for nine (40.9%) the differences were in the opposite direction relative to the microarray data; for cigarette butt DNA, results were 50%, 22.7%, and 27.3%, respectively. The discrepancies between reference-type and trace-type DNA outcomes can be explained by cell composition differences, method-to-method variation, and other technical reasons including bisulfite conversion inefficiency. Our study highlights the importance of the DNA source and that careful characterization of biological and technical effects is needed before epigenetic MZ twin differentiation is applicable in forensic casework.",

        "Abstract": "In contrast with Th1 immune responses against pathogenic viruses and bacteria, the incipient events that generate Th2 responses remain less understood. One difficulty in the identification of universal operating principles stems from the diversity of entities against which cellular and molecular Th2 responses are produced. Such responses are launched against harmful macroscopic parasites and noxious substances, such as venoms, but also against largely innocuous allergens. This suggests that the established understanding about sense and recognition applied to Th1 responses may not be translatable to Th2 responses. This review will discuss processes and signals known to occur in Th2 responses, particularly in the context of food allergy. We propose that perturbations of homeostasis at barrier sites induced by external or internal subverters, which can activate or lower the threshold activation of the immune system, are the major requirement for allergic sensitization. Innate signals produced in the tissue under these conditions equip dendritic cells with a program that forms an adaptive Th2 response.",

        "Abstract": "Literature on timing of rib trauma is scarce but remains challenging during forensic cases. This study analysed the macroscopic fracture patterns of perimortem rib fractures and compared them to experimentally reproduced rib fractures on fresh and dry ribs. Six distinctive macroscopic traits were found in ribs that might provide information about the timing of trauma, fracture mechanism and/or trauma circumstances. These traits are peels, folds, differential fracture edges, incomplete fractures, plastic deformation and longitudinal lines. Peels, folds and plastic deformation might provide information about trauma timing. Folds and different fracture edges might provide information about the fracture mechanism. Statistical analyses showed that longitudinal lines, folds and incomplete fractures might provide information about the trauma circumstances and that age might have an influence on the occurrence of complete fractures, longitudinal lines and peels (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05). The new insights presented in this study might be valuable for forensic anthropologists in rib trauma analysis.",

However, if these therapeutics influence the peptidergic circuits in the amygdala remains unclear. This study specifies the impact profile of the classical antipsychotic drugs on mRNA expression of the spexin/NPQ, kisspeptin-1 and POMC in the rat amygdala. Animals were treated with haloperidol and chlorpromazine for 28\u00a0days prior to transcript quantification via qPCR. Haloperidol and chlorpromazine induced a change in the expression of all neuropeptides analyzed. Both drugs led to the decrease of Kiss-1 expression, whereas in POMC and spexin/NPQ their up-regulation in the amygdala was detected. These modulating effects on may represent alternative, so far unknown mechanisms, of classical antipsychotic drugs triggering pharmacological responses.",

        "Abstract": "The monitoring of soil quality should be a control tool used to reduce the adverse health effects arising from exposure to toxic chemicals in soil through cultivated crop absorption. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the monitoring and control system of soil quality in Poland, in terms of consumer safety, for agricultural plants cultivated in areas with known serious cadmium contamination, such as Silesia Province. To achieve the objective, the contents of cadmium in soils and vegetables in the Silesia administrative area were examined. The obtained results were compared with the results of soil contamination from the quality monitoring of arable soil in Poland. The studies show a significant exceedance of the permissible values of cadmium in soil samples and the vegetables cultivated on that soil. The threat to consumer health is a valid concern, although this threat was not indicated by the results of the national monitoring of soil quality. The results indicated an unequal distribution of risk to consumers resulting from contaminated soil. Moreover, the monitoring systems should be designed at the local or regional scale to guarantee the safety of consumers of edible plants cultivated in the areas contaminated with cadmium.",

        "Abstract": "Two new species of the genus Orchesella Templeton, 1836 have been identified following intensive sampling in the Colluvial Milieu Souterrain Superficiel (Mesovoid Shallow Substratum, or MSS) of the Sierra de Guadarrama using Subterranean Sampling Devices (SSD). The data were obtained from the first extraction of the traps between May and October of 2015. During a study of the Collembola taxon, 32 different genera (61 species) were identified. The highest representative genus presence in almost all traps was Orchesella, with two new species. One of the two species described had been misidentified until this study was carried out, indicating that their preferential habitat had not been sampled; the second species had never been identified. The community of the Orchesella species in the Colluvial MSS was investigated, leading to the conclusion that this environment has its own assemblage of characteristic species. The opportunity to study specimens that belong to five species of the genus Orchesella, including three previously recollected, has allowed for obtaining reliable information regarding their macrochaetotaxy. A part of this chaetotaxy is proposed as a useful diagnostic tool for the species of the genus. In conclusion, it can be affirmed that this study has demonstrated that the Colluvial Mesovoid Shallow Substratum (Colluvial MSS) has its own fauna, and it supports the hypothesis that it constitutes a new biotope, at least for Collembola.",

        "Abstract": "Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins constitute the largest family of proteins in angiosperms, and most members are predicted to play roles in the maturation of organellar RNAs. Here we describe the novel mitochondrial editing factor 31 (MEF31), an E-PPR protein involved in editing at two close sites in the same transcript encoding subunit C of the twin-arginine translocation (tat) pathway. MEF31 is essential for editing at site tatC-581 and application of the recently proposed amino acid code for RNA recognition by PPR proteins supports the view that MEF31 directly targets this site by recognizing its cis sequence. In contrast, editing at site tatC-586 five nucleotides downstream is only partially affected in plants lacking MEF31, being restored to wild-type levels in complemented plants. Application of the amino acid code and analysis of individual RNA molecules for editing at sites 581 and 586 suggest that MEF31 does not directly target site tatC-586, and only indirectly influences editing at this site. It is likely that editing at site tatC-581 improves recognition of the site tatC-586 cis sequence by a second unknown PPR protein.",

This article systematically reviews the literature on the evaluation of oral soft tissue blood microcirculation by LDF. We analysed the available literature through October 2016 using the database resources Medline/PubMed, the Cochrane Oral Health Group Specialist Trials Register and the ISI Web of Knowledge. Several points emerged from this literature review The use of LDF involves specific constraints; however, the influence of different factors (temperature, tobacco, pressure etc.) must be adequately controlled when using LDF. LDF measurements of soft tissue within the oral cavity vary depending on the anatomical site. In dentistry, LDF can be used to track healing progress in periodontal surgery and to diagnose vascular flow changes in the connective tissue of mucosae covered by a removable prosthesis at an early stage prior to the onset of clinical inflammation signs.",

        "Abstract": "The analysis of Y-chromosome variation has provided valuable clues about the paternal history of domestic animal populations. The main goal of the current work was to characterize Y-chromosome diversity in 31 goat populations from Central Eastern (Switzerland and Romania) and Southern Europe (Spain and Italy) as well as in reference populations from Africa and the Near East. Towards this end, we have genotyped seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), mapping to the SRY, ZFY, AMELY and DDX3Y Y-linked loci, in 275 bucks from 31 populations. We have observed a low level of variability in the goat Y-chromosome, with just five haplotypes segregating in the whole set of populations. We have also found that Swiss bucks carry exclusively Y1 haplotypes (Y1A: 24%, Y1B1: 15%, Y1B2: 43% and Y1C: 18%), while in Italian and Spanish bucks Y2A is the most abundant haplotype (77%). Interestingly, in Carpathian goats from Romania the Y2A haplotype is also frequent (42%). The high Y-chromosome differentiation between Swiss and Italian/Spanish breeds might be due to the post-domestication spread of two different Near Eastern genetic stocks through the Danubian and Mediterranean corridors. Historical gene flow between Southern European and Northern African goats might have also contributed to generate such pattern of genetic differentiation.",

        "Abstract": "The way teeth grow is recorded in dental enamel as incremental marks. Detailed analysis of tooth growth is known to provide valuable insights into the growth and the pace of life of vertebrates. Here, we study the growth pattern of the first lower molar in several extant and extinct species of Equus and explore its relationship with life history events. Our histological analysis shows that enamel extends beyond the molar's cervix in these mammals. We identified three different crown developmental stages (CDS) in the first lower molars of equids characterised by different growth rates and likely to be related to structural and ontogenetic modifications of the tooth. Enamel extension rate, which ranges from \u2248400 \u03bcm/d at the beginning of crown development to rates of \u224830 \u03bcm/d near the root, and daily secretion rate (\u224817 \u03bcm/d) have been shown to be very conservative within the genus. From our results, we also inferred data of molar wear rate for these equids that suggest higher wear rates at early ontogenetic stages (13\u2009mm/y) than commonly assumed. The results obtained here provide a basis for future studies of equid dentition in different scientific areas, involving isotope, demographic and dietary studies.",
